It supports the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF). The RLEF \"oversees and co-ordinates the development of the sport in all its member countries and those neighbouring organisations that choose to link to the RLEF\". The RLEF operates several competitions, most notably the European Cup.\n\nThe federation was founded January 2003 following an initiative between Richard Lewis, Executive Chairman of Britain's Rugby Football League (RFL) and his French counterpart Jean Paul Ferre. The RLEF's first constitution was approved in January 2004 and the federation's first Board of Directors was elected. This first Board of Directors consisted of Jean Paul Ferre as President/Chairman and Richard Lewis as Deputy Chairman with Nigel Wood and Nicolas Larrat being the other Board members. Representatives for Morocco, Italy, Serbia, Russia, Lebanon, Ireland, Scotland and Wales attended. Russia became a full member of the RLEF, joining Britain and France, and the RLIF soon after.\n\nAt the time of its foundation, the RLEF placed a \"particular emphasis on generating development funding within each country\". Historically, much of the development work conducted in Europe had been funded by the RFL. Following the profitable 2008 World Cup, the RFL and RLEF prepared to bid for funds to enhance their activities.\n\nIn December 2009, Kevin Rudd, a former Scotland rugby league international, stepped down as Executive Officer of the RLEF after more than five years in the post. RLEF Chairman Richard Lewis stated that Rudd \"has done an outstanding job and created a platform, structure and competitions framework that can take us into the future\". Rudd was succeeded by Danny Kazandjian. Kazandjian had previously been a key figure in the establishment of rugby league in Lebanon and had led the RLEF's development drive in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions as Director of Development for the Euro-Med region.\n\nCurrently eleven nations are full members of the federation; there are also ten associate members and sixteen official observers. Full members are entitled to a greater proportion of voting rights and to become members of the Rugby League International Federation.\n\nIn order to become an associate member, a nation must meet the following criteria:\n\nThe RLEF stipulates that continued associate and full membership of the federation is subject to a check every two years to ensure that the minimum criteria are still being met.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His grandfather Oates Bairstow, was founder of the eponymous clothing firm.\n\nHe studied the organ with John Farmer at Balliol College, Oxford, and while articled under Frederick Bridge of Westminster Abbey received tuition from Walter Alcock. He studied organ and theory at the University of Durham, receiving the Bachelor of Music in 1894, and the Doctor of Music in 1901.\n\nAfter holding posts in London, Wigan and Leeds, he served as organist of York Minster from 1913 to his death, when he was succeeded by his former pupil Francis Jackson. Jackson went on to write a biography of Bairstow. He was knighted in 1932.\n\nNotorious for his terseness and bluntness, Bairstow did not always endear himself to others. Asked whether he would be willing to follow the example of his predecessor at York, Thomas Tertius Noble, and emigrate to the United States, he replied that he would \"rather go to the devil\". Comfortably ensconced in Yorkshire, where he was a close friend of the equally blunt Charles Harry Moody, organist at Ripon Cathedral, he refused an offer to succeed Frederick Bridge at Westminster Abbey. He instead recommended his erstwhile pupil Ernest Bullock, who was duly appointed to the post.\n\n\nBairstow's compositions are mainly for the church. He wrote 29 anthems, ranging from large-scale works for choir and organ such as \"Blessed city, heavenly Salem\" to elegant miniatures like \"I sat down under his shadow\" and \"Jesu, the very thought of thee\". Among his anthems, the masterly \"Let all mortal flesh keep silence\" is perhaps the best known. His service music includes published settings in D (Evening 1906, Communion 1913, Morning 1925), E♭ (Full Setting, 1923), and G (Evening, 1940), and several unpublished works. He also composed psalm chants, hymn tunes, and a cantata, \"The Prodigal Son\", for choir and chamber orchestra.\n\nBairstow was also active as an instrumental composer, mainly for the organ, and some 12 pieces were published in his lifetime, the finest being the 1937 Sonata in E♭. His small output of chamber music includes a set of variations for two pianos and another set of variations for violin and piano, both long out of print.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It acts to dorsiflex and invert the foot. This muscle is mostly located near the shin.\n\nIt is situated on the lateral side of the tibia; it is thick and fleshy above, tendinous below. The tibialis anterior overlaps the anterior tibial vessels and deep peroneal nerve in the upper part of the leg.\n\nIt arises from the lateral condyle and upper half or two-thirds of the lateral surface of the body of the tibia; from the adjoining part of the interosseous membrane; from the deep surface of the fascia; and from the intermuscular septum between it and the extensor digitorum longus.\n\nThe fibers of this circumpennate muscle are relatively parallel to the plane of insertion, ending in a tendon, apparent on the anteriomedial dorsal aspect of the foot close to the ankle.\n\nAfter passing through the most medial compartments of the transverse and cruciate crural ligaments, it is inserted into the medial and under surface of the medial cuneiform bone and the base of the first metatarsal bone.\n\nDeep peroneal (fibular) nerve, branch of common peroneal (fibular) nerve (L4, L5, S1).\n\nA deep portion of the muscle is rarely inserted into the talus, or a tendinous slip may pass to the head of the first metatarsal bone or the base of the first phalanx of the great toe.\n\nThe tibiofascialis anterior, a small muscle from the lower part of the tibia to the transverse or cruciate crural ligaments or deep fascia.\n\nThe tibialis anterior muscle is the most medial muscle of the anterior compartment of the leg. It is responsible for dorsiflexing and inverting the foot. The muscle has two origins, one being the lateral tibial condyle and the other being the upper lateral surface of the tibia, and inserts on the medial surface of the medial cuneiform and adjoining part of base of the first metatarsal of the foot allowing the toe to be pulled up and held in a locked position. It also allows for the ankle to be inverted giving the ankle horizontal movement allowing for some cushion if the ankle were to be rolled. It is innervated by the deep peroneal nerve and acts as both an antagonist and a synergist of the tibialis posterior. However, the most accurate antagonist of the tibialis anterior is the peroneus longus. The tibialis anterior aides in the activities of walking, running, hiking, kicking a ball, or any activity that requires moving the leg or keeping the leg vertical. It functions to stabilize the ankle as the foot hits the ground during the contact phase of walking (eccentric contraction) and acts later to pull the foot clear of the ground during the swing phase (concentric contraction). It also functions to 'lock' the ankle, as in toe-kicking a ball, when held in an isometric contraction.\n\nAntagonists are plantar-flexors of the posterior compartment such as soleus and gastrocnemius.\n\nThe movements of tibialis anterior are dorsiflexion and inversion of the ankle. However, actions of tibialis anterior are dependent on whether the foot is weight bearing or not (closed or open kinetic chain). When the foot is on the ground, the muscle helps to balance the leg and talus on the other tarsal bones so that the leg is kept vertical even when walking on uneven ground.\n\nmedial view of dissected ankle has two muscles\n\n"}

(1976 film)\n\nUp! is a 1976 soft core sex comedy film directed by Russ Meyer and starring Raven De La Croix, Robert McLane, Kitten Natividad, and Monty Bane.\n\nA man named Adolf Schwartz, Adolf Hitler in hiding, is living in a Bavarian-style castle in northern California. After an orgy in the dungeon with several women of different ethnicities and a man, Paul, he is murdered when someone places a ravenous piranha fish in his bathtub. Who did it?\n\nA voluptuous woman named Margo Winchester appears in the nearby town \"Miranda\" and is spotted by local Sheriff Homer Johnson. He tries to make advances but Margo rejects flirtatiously (at this point). After that she is picked up by Leonard Box, a known troublemaker and son of a sawmill owner. An argument breaks out with the result that Leonard subdues and rapes the unconscious Margo, after that she accidentally kills him. This is witnessed by Homer, but he covers up the incident because Box's loaded father would put Margo in jail forever and of course he is horny for the busty beauty. So Margo and Homer wind up sleeping together, starting some kind of relationship, but a mutually unfaithful one as it can be seen later.\n\nHomer helps Margo get a job at the local diner, Alice's. It is owned by Alice who is married to Paul, who was sexually servicing Schwartz. Alice also likes women, depicted earlier in the movie. Paul is similarly unfaithful, he was interested in Limehouse, an Asian woman that participated in Schwartz's orgy and after Margo finishes work and goes for a swim at the Salmon Creek, he comes after her. While Margo undresses besides the stream Paul does the same before approaching her and they have sex. Homer, who had stopped a woman earlier for a traffic violation and let her go after a blowjob, is in bed with an Native American woman named Pocohontas and shoves her out of the house when he hears Margo's van approaching, after she and Paul finished their date. Still nude she enters the house, seemingly ready for a second round with Homer who's under the shower to clean himself up. Scalding himself with hot water by accident. Margo comments on his red penis that he must have made it with an Indian!\n\nKitten Natividad plays the \"Greek Chorus\", who appears nude between scenes throughout the film to provide narration, plot details, and updates.\n\nMargo performs a strip show at a bar which triggers the reaction of the lumberjack Rafe who rapes her. The other guests join in and flee when Homer arrives, both men end up killing each other!\n\nIt is revealed that Alice committed the murder because she was jealous about Schwartz, who was also her father, sleeping with her husband, and that Margo is an undercover cop to investigate the crime.\n\n\nIn the early 1970s Russ Meyer made two flops in a row, \"The Seven Minutes\" and \"Black Snake\" before returning to his older style with \"Supervixens\". He said \"\"I'm back to big bosums, square jaws, lotsa action and the most sensational sex you ever saw,\" he said. \"I'm back to what I do best - erotic, comedic sex, sex, sex - and I'll never stray again.\"\n\n\"Supervixens\" was a hit and Meyer said afterwards, \"I plan to stick to what I know works and make one X picture after the next and be even more outrageous with sex and keep pushing the boundaries further and further.\"\n\n\"Sure it appeals to prurient interest,\" said Meyer. \"Why not appeal to prurient interest?\"\n\nThe film starred Kitten Natavidad, who Meyer would become romantically involved with. Natavidad later said she \"loved\" making the film. She was comfortably with the nudity \"but what was uncomfortable was when he would direct me and I had all these big big lines and he would say, \"don't blink\" and I was facing the sun and my eyes would get dry... It was uncomfortable making it because I sat on trees that had ants crawling up my ass.\"\n\nMeyer said he found \"there was a lot of objection to the violence\" in the film. \"I always felt that they would take it in the manner I presented it. That if a man got a double-bitted axe buried in his chest, he could still wrench it out, run 100 yards and kill a giant with a chainsaw. But they just took it very seriously. So what I've done is to kind of ape the violence that I've had before and it seems to get a good reaction.\"\n\nMeyer said the film cost almost as much as \"Ultravixens\" \"simply because I had to do so many inserts and so forth. The cost of additional shooting can be very substantial. You have to consider the escalation of lab costs.\"\n\nMeyer later said he was \"not particularly\" pleased with the film. \"At the time I was fairly pleased, but I see a lot of reasons why it was not as successful as \"Supervixen\" is.\"\n\n"}

He directed the Choir of St Paul's Cathedral in London from 1990 to 2004. He then directed the Choir of Men and Boys of St Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue in New York City until his death at age 59. Whilst training countless young musicians, he maintained an active career as an international concert performer and recording artist, and was acclaimed as \"the premier English organist of his generation\".\n\nBorn to Hetty (née Murphy) and Douglas Gavin Scott in Wakefield, Yorkshire, John Scott began his musical career as a chorister at Wakefield Cathedral. It was also there that he first learned to play the organ. From 1974 to 1978, he was Organ Scholar at St John's College, Cambridge, assisting George Guest and studying with Jonathan Bielby, Ralph Downes and Gillian Weir.\n\nUpon graduation, he was appointed as Assistant Organist at St Paul's Cathedral and Southwark Cathedral, both in London. After 1985, he worked full-time at St Paul's, which led to his appointment as Organist and Director of Music when Christopher Dearnley retired in 1990. Scott performed at numerous special occasions for the British Royal Family, including the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, the 100th birthday of The Queen Mother, and the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. He also served on the organ faculty of the Royal Academy of Music.\n\nIn 2004, Scott moved to New York City to succeed Gerre Hancock as Organist and Director of Music at St Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue, home of an internationally renowned choir and the only church-affiliated choir boarding school in North America.\n\nScott recorded dozens of CDs for labels that included Hyperion, Priory, Decca, Nimbus, Sony, and Chandos. He also compiled chants and psalm texts to publish in \"The New St Paul's Cathedral Psalter\", later reprinted for worldwide distribution as \"The Anglican Psalter\". Highlights of his concert career included the complete organ works of Bach, Buxtehude, Duruflé, Franck, Mendelssohn and Messiaen, and the complete organ symphonies of Vierne and Widor.\n\nIn 1978, Scott won the inaugural Manchester International Organ Competition, and in 1984 he became the first British organist ever to win the International Bach Competition in Leipzig, Germany. In 1998, he was named \"International Performer of the Year\" by the New York City Chapter of the American Guild of Organists. Queen Elizabeth appointed him as a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in the 2004 New Year Honours, in recognition of his work at St Paul's Cathedral. In 2007, Scott was awarded an honorary doctorate from Nashotah House Theological Seminary. The organ at Saint Thomas Church, built by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, was posthumously dedicated in his memory.\n\nHe married Carolyn Jane Lumsden, daughter of organist David Lumsden, on 28 July 1979. They had a son and a daughter before divorcing in June 2010.\n\nScott married former organist Lily Ardalan on 25 May 2013, and three weeks after his death, their son was born.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, at age 59, Scott performed fourteen organ recitals across seven European countries in six weeks. He completed what would become his final concert tour, and returned to New York on 11 August 2015. The next day, he suffered a cardiac episode, was admitted to Roosevelt Hospital, and died there with his wife Lily at his side. St Thomas Church held a public funeral service on 12 September 2015.\n\nAlong with numerous industry awards, Scott's many recordings were honoured with two dedicated episodes of the prestigious \"Pipedreams\" radio broadcast.\n\nHyperion:\nPriory:\nCastle:\nGuild:\nJAV:\nNimbus:\n\nHyperion:\nConifer:\nDecca:\nEMI:\nGuild:\nPrelude:\nPro Organo:\nResonus:\n\n"}

In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered that Imperial messengers be sent to report important events to the guardian \"kami\" of Japan. These messenger, called \"heihaku\", were initially presented to 16 shrines; and in 991, Emperor Ichijō added three more shrines to Murakami's list — including Kitano.\n\nFrom 1871 through 1946, the Kitano Tenman-gū was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the second rank of government supported shrines.\n\nThe shrine was dedicated to Michizane; and in 986, the scholar-bureaucrat was deified and the title of \"Tenjin\" was conferred.\nThe grounds are filled with Michizane's favorite tree, the red and white \"ume\" or plum blossom, and when they blossom the shrine is often very crowded. The Plum Blossom Festival (梅花祭, \"baikasai\") is held on February 25, coinciding with the monthly market. An open-air tea ceremony (野点, \"nodate\") is hosted by geiko and apprentice maiko from the nearby Kamishichiken district, where tea and wagashi are served to 3,000 guests by geisha and maiko. The plum festival has been held on the same day every year for about 900 years to mark the death of Michizane. The outdoor tea ceremony dates back to 1952. In that year, a big festival was held to mark the 1,050th anniversary of Michizane's death, based on the historic Kitano Ochakai tea ceremony hosted at the shrine by Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nKitano Tenmangū is popular with students praying for success in exams because the deity was in his life a man of literature and knowledge. On the 25th of every month, the shrine hosts a flea market. Together with the similar festival at Tō-ji, a temple in the same city, they inspired the Kyoto proverb, \"Fair weather at the Tōji market means rainy weather at the Tenjin market,\" calling to mind Kyoto's fickle weather.\n\n\n\n"}

Elektron is unusually light and has a specific gravity of about 1.8 compared with the 2.8 of aluminium alloy, or the 7.9 of steel. Magnesium's relatively low density makes its alloy variants suitable for use in auto racing and aerospace engineering applications.\n\nElektron or \"Elektronmetall\" was first developed in 1908 by Gustav Pistor and Wilhelm Moschel at the Bitterfeld works of Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron (CFGE or CFG), whose HQ was in Griesheim am Main, Germany. The composition of the initial Elektron alloy was approximately Mg 90%, Al 9%, other 1%. At its pavilion at the International Aviation Fair (Internationale Luftschiffahrt-Ausstellung, ILA) in Frankfurt am Main in 1909, CFG exhibited an Adler 75HP engine with a cast magnesium alloy crankcase. Also exhibiting at the 1909 Frankfurt Air Exhibition was August Euler (1868–1957) – owner of German pilot's licence No. 1 – who manufactured Voisin biplanes under licence in Griesheim am Main. His Voisins with Adler 50 hp engines flew in October 1909.\n\nCFG joined the newly created IG Farben as an associate company in 1916. During the Allied Occupation after World War I, a Major Charles J. P. Ball, DSO, MC, of the Royal Horse Artillery was stationed in Germany. He later joined F. A. Hughes and Co. Ltd., which began manufacturing elektron in the UK under licence from IG Farben from around 1923.\n\nCFG merged fully with the IG Farben conglomerate in 1925 along with Versuchsbau Hellmuth Hirth (a copper alloy manufacturer), and another company, Elektronmetall Bad Cannstatt Stuttgart, was formed. In 1935 IG Farben, ICI and F. A. Hughes and Co. (22% shares) founded Magnesium Elektron Ltd. of Clifton, Greater Manchester. The company is still manufacturing alloys in 2017.\n\nElektron has been used in aircraft, Zeppelins, and motor racing applications. \nIn 1924 magnesium alloys (AZ; 2,5–3,0% Al; 3,0–4,0% Zn) were used in automobile pistons diecast by Elektronmetall Bad Cannstatt, another IG Farben company formed out of Versuchsbau Hellmuth Hirth.\n\nSiemens-Halske used elektron casings for their \"Hellschreiber\" military teleprinter.\n\nIncendiary bombs using elektron were developed towards the end of the First World War by both Germany (the B-1E \"Elektronbrandbombe\" or \"Stabbrandbombe\") and the UK. Although neither side used this type of bomb operationally during the conflict, Erich Ludendorff mentions in his memoirs a plan to bomb Paris with a new type of incendiary bomb with the aim of overwhelming the city's fire services; this planned raid was also reported in \"Le Figaro\" on 21 December 1918. The lightness of elektron meant that a large aeroplane like the Zeppelin-Staaken R-type bomber could carry hundreds of bomblets.\n\nThe British and German incendiary bombs, used extensively during World War II, weighed about 1 kg and consisted of an outer casing made of elektron alloy, which was filled with thermite pellets and fitted with a fuse. The fuse ignited the thermite, which in turn ignited the magnesium casing; it burned for about 15 minutes. Trying to douse the fire with water only intensified the reaction. It could not be extinguished and burned at such a high temperature that it could penetrate armour plate.\n\nThe bodywork of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR racing car was made of elektron. When it crashed and burst into flames during the 1955 Le Mans race, spectators in the stands were showered with burning debris. Stewards pouring water on the fires only made things worse, and the wreck burned for several hours. In addition to the driver Pierre Levegh, the death toll was approximately 80 to 84 spectators, killed either by flying debris or from the fire, with a further 120 to 178 injured.\n\n\n"}

Tertius Noble\n\nThomas Tertius Noble (May 5, 1867 – May 4, 1953) was an English-born organist and composer, resident in the United States for the latter part of his career. \n\nHe served as organist and choirmaster at a number of churches including Ely Cathedral in England and St Thomas Episcopal Church in New York City. He is chiefly remembered for his music for the Anglican church.\n\nNoble was born on 5 May 1867 in Bath, England.\n\nIn his youth, Noble was introduced to the pipe organ by James Pyne, organist at Bath Abbey, and from 1880, Noble was tutored in the organ at Gloucester Cathedral.\nThe young Noble was appointed organist at All Saints' Church, Colchester, where he was also educated by the rector. Noble won a scholarship to attend the Royal College of Music, where he was tutored by Walter Parratt, Charles Villiers Stanford and Frederick Bridge.\n\nAfter Noble graduated from the Royal College of Music in 1889, he was appointed a member of staff there, teaching the organ. Noble also took the position of organist at the Church of St John the Evangelist, Wilton Road, in London.\n\nIn 1890, Stanford recommended him to fill the vacancy as his assistant organist at Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge. Noble was dissatisfied with the quality of singing and Stanford's bad temper.\n\nNoble left Trinity in 1892 to serve as organist and choirmaster at Ely Cathedral. Whilst there, he married the daughter of the dean of Ely, Muriel Maud Stubbs. From 1898 to 1913, Noble served as organist at York Minster, a post he held for 14 years. At York, he established the York Symphony Orchestra, and composed pieces for them. In 1910, revived the York Festival. \n\nIn 1913, Noble moved to America after accepting the post of organist and choirmaster of St Thomas Episcopal Church in New York City. He was responsible for establishing a choral tradition at St Thomas's along Anglican cathedral lines. He also oversaw the installation of a new organ at St Thomas's and founded the Saint Thomas Choir School for boys in 1919. This was Noble's final position which he held for 35 years.\n\nNoble composed orchestral and chamber music, but is now remembered for his music for the Anglican church, particularly his Evening services in a\nA major, B minor and A minor, and his anthems \"Go to dark Gethsemane\", \"Souls of the Righteous\", and \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit\". His tunes were used for seven hymns in \"The Hymnal of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, 1940\". His tune \"Ora labora\" for the hymn \"Come, labour on\" is well known in the United States, as is his edition of Handel's \"Messiah\", published by G. Schirmer in 1912.\n\nNoble died on 4 May 1953 in Rockport, Massachusetts and he was buried at Beech Grove Cemetery there. The hymn tune composed by Noble was named after the city of his death.\n\nT.

This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, \"agbayun\", \"taami\", \"asaa\", and \"ledidi\".\n\nThe berry itself has a low sugar content and a mildly sweet tang. It contains a glycoprotein molecule, with some trailing carbohydrate chains, called miraculin. When the fleshy part of the fruit is eaten, this molecule binds to the tongue's taste buds, causing sour foods to taste sweet. At neutral pH, miraculin binds and blocks the receptors, but at low pH (resulting from ingestion of sour foods) miraculin binds proteins and becomes able to activate the sweet receptors, resulting in the perception of sweet taste. This effect lasts until the protein is washed away by saliva (up to about 30 minutes).\n\nThe names miracle fruit and miracle berry are shared by \"Gymnema sylvestre\" and \"Thaumatococcus daniellii\", which are two other species used to alter the perceived sweetness of foods.\n\nThe berry has been used in West Africa since at least the 18th century, when European explorer – the Chevalier des Marchais – provided an account of its use there. Marchais, who was searching West Africa for many different fruits in a 1725 excursion, noticed that local people picked the berry from shrubs and chewed it before meals.\n\nIn the 1980s in the United States, an attempt was made to commercialize the fruit for its ability to mask non-sweet foods as sweet without a caloric cost, but became compromised when the Food and Drug Administration classified the berry as a food additive and required evidence of safety. For a time in the 1970s, US dieters could purchase a pill form of miraculin. This interest had a revival in food-tasting events at which tasters consume sour and bitter foods, such as lemons, radishes, pickles, hot sauce, and beer, then experience the perceived change to sweetness with miraculin.\n\nIt is a shrub that grows in height and has dense foliage. Its leaves are long, wide, and glabrous below. They are clustered at the ends of the branchlets. The flowers are white. It carries red, long fruits. Each fruit contains one seed.\n\nThe plant grows best in soils with a pH as low as 4.5 to 5.8, in an environment free from frost and in partial shade with high humidity. It is tolerant of drought, full sunshine, and slopes.\n\nThe seeds need 14 to 21 days to germinate. A spacing of 4 m between plants is suggested.\n\nThe plants first bear fruit after growing about 3–4 years, and produce two crops per year, after the end of the rainy season. This evergreen plant produces small, red berries, while white flowers are produced for many months of the year.\n\nThe seeds are about the size of coffee beans.\n\nIn Africa, leaves are attacked by lepidopterous larvae, and fruits are infested with larvae of fruit flies. The fungus \"Rigidoporus microporus\" has been found on this plant.\n\nTransgenic tomato plants have been developed in research projects that produce miraculin.\n\nIn tropical West Africa, where this species originates, the fruit pulp is used to sweeten palm wine. Historically, it was also used to improve the flavor of soured cornbread, but has been used as a sweetener and flavoring agent for diverse beverages and foods, such as beer, cocktails, vinegar, and pickles.\n\nThe berry is on the EU list of novel foods, and requires a safety assessment before it can be sold as food or used as a food additive. Since 2011, the United States FDA has imposed a ban on importing \"Synsepalum dulcificum\" (specifying 'miraculin') from its origin in Taiwan, declaring it as an \"illegal undeclared sweetener\".\n\n"}

He played drums with acts such as Trini Lopez and Bob Dylan, with whom he played on his 1966 world tour. He became a founding member of The First Edition with singer Kenny Rogers, and played on all of their albums. Overall, Jones played on 17 gold records from his musical career of over two decades.\n\nAfter the break-up of The First Edition in 1976, Jones concentrated on his career as a character actor, where he made many appearances on film and television.\n\nMickey Jones was born on June 10, 1941, in Houston, Texas, to Fred Edward Jones, a U.S. Navy officer, and Frances Marie (née Vieregge) Jones, a homemaker. His sister, Cheryl Marie, died in 2006.\n\nJones attended Sunset High School in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas. It was during this time that he obtained and learned to play his first set of drums. After sitting in with several local bands, Jones and four schoolmates formed their own band, called The Catalinas. Although the band saw some local success, he was replaced by a new drummer, as Jones was only sixteen at the time, and the band wanted someone who was of legal age.\n\nAfter working as a freelance drummer with various acts, Jones was introduced to Trini Lopez. When Lopez's drummer became ill, he was asked to take his place and eventually became the band's new permanent drummer.\n\nIn 1959, Jones left Lopez's band to pursue a degree in business administration at North Texas State College (now University of North Texas). After college, he took a job at Rohr Aircraft in San Diego. Seeing that the life of a factory worker was not for him, Jones moved to Los Angeles to get back into the entertainment industry. He landed a job as a page at the NBC studios, while re-establishing his friendship with Lopez, who had moved to Los Angeles as well. Jones would again become Lopez's drummer, while Lopez would see much success with hits such as \"If I Had A Hammer\", \"La Bamba\" and \"America\".\n\nIn 1966, Jones was made an offer by Bob Dylan to join him as his back-up drummer. Replacing Levon Helm, who had quit, Jones would accompany Dylan with the other members of what would become The Band, on his world tour of Australia and Europe. It was during this tour while performing at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England, on May 17, 1966, that the audience jeered Dylan for playing the electric guitar during the latter half of the show.\nJones' career with Dylan would be cut short when Dylan had to temporarily stop performing in order to recover from a motorcycle accident.\n\nAt this time, Jones had decided to pursue a career in acting. He had landed jobs as an extra, when in 1967 he was approached to be the drummer for a new group called The First Edition, with lead singer Kenny Rogers.\n\nWith hits such as \"Something's Burning\", \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\" and \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\", The First Edition would see much success over the next ten years, even having their own television variety show, \"Rollin' on the River\" (later shortened to \"Rollin\"), in the early 1970s.\n\nAfter the breakup of The First Edition in 1976, Jones pursued a full-time career in acting. As a character actor, he would make many appearances on television and film, such as being part of the cast of \"Flo\", the short-lived spin-off to the CBS sitcom \"Alice\", his role as a crooked mechanic/sheriff in \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" and his role as Chris Farber, the buddy of Ham Tyler (Michael Ironside) in the miniseries and weekly television series, \"V\".\n\nLater, Jones would have a cameo in Ironside's film \"Total Recall\" (1990). Jones had no scenes with Ironside - he played a Martian miner on a train with Doug Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger).\n\nIn 1992, he played a small but memorable role in the television show \"Northern Exposure\" episode \"Heroes\" as Chris Steven's (John Corbett) deceased mentor, Tooley O'Toole, who is delivered to Chris in a wooden box. The Tooley character has a cult following on Facebook through the page 'Tooley Lives'.\n\nHe appeared as the subway riding biker in a Breath Savers commercial and had a recurring role as Pete Bilker on the ABC sitcom \"Home Improvement\". In 1996, he appeared in \"Sling Blade\" as the drummer in the band (a prominent speaking part in the band scenes), and \"Tin Cup\", with fellow character actor Dennis Burkley. He and Burkley were commonly mistaken for each other.\n\nIn 2005, he contributed to the documentary, \"No Direction Home: Bob Dylan\". From 2011 to 2014, he had a recurring role on the television show \"Justified\", as Rodney \"Hot Rod\" Dunham, a marijuana distributor who ran a small band of criminals.\n\nIn 2009, Jones published his autobiography \"That Would Be Me\", the title based on the catchphrase often used by his character on \"Home Improvement\".\n\nJones died from complications of diabetes on February 7, 2018, aged 76. He is survived by his wife, Phyllis Jean Starr, and their two children, and three step children.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2020581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020581", "title": "Herbert Sumsion", "text": "Herbert Sumsion\n\nHerbert Whitton Sumsion CBE (14 January 1899 – 11 August 1995) was an English musician who was organist of Gloucester Cathedral from 1928 to 1967. Through his leadership role with the Three Choirs Festival, Sumsion maintained close associations with major figures in England's 20th-century musical renaissance, including Edward Elgar, Herbert Howells, Gerald Finzi, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Although Sumsion is known primarily as a cathedral musician, his professional career spanned more than 60 years and encompassed composing, conducting, performing, accompanying, and teaching. His compositions include works for choir and organ, as well as lesser-known chamber and orchestral works.\n\nSumsion was born in Gloucester, a cathedral city on the River Severn. In 1908, at the age of nine, Sumsion became a probationer in the Gloucester cathedral choir, which was then under the direction of Herbert Brewer. After two years Sumsion became a full chorister and sang with the choir until 1914. From 1911 to 1915 he was organist at Ashleworth, a small village six miles from Gloucester, responsible for the church choir and the \"organ blower\" for a fee of £5 a quarter, quite a responsibility for a 12 year old. Gloucester was (and is) one of the three host cities, along with Worcester and Hereford, of the Three Choirs Festival, an annual festival of choral emphasis first held in the early 18th century. Sumsion would later write of his musically formative experiences at the cathedral: ‘Quite soon after my entry into the choir I was singing with the [Three Choirs] Festival Chorus and gradually absorbing the choral music of the great classical composers and the contemporary writers, of whom the giant was certainly Elgar.' When Sumsion’s treble voice broke at age 15, he became an ‘articled pupil’ to Brewer, a designation connoting a three-year apprenticeship in organ, choral direction, and music theory. As one of Brewer's articled pupils Sumsion was following in the footsteps of his slightly older contemporaries, Herbert Howells and Ivor Gurney. Sumsion passed the Associateship exam of the Royal College of Organists in 1915, and in July 1916 joined Howells in passing the Fellowship exam; though he was only 17, Sumsion was awarded the Turpin prize for the second-highest marks in the practical component.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1919 Sumsion served in the Queen's Westminster Rifles and spent time in the Flanders trenches. In 1919 he returned to Gloucester cathedral to take up an appointment as assistant organist to Brewer. Sumsion's duties during this period included serving as accompanist for the Three Choirs Festival Chorus, which occasioned a brief but memorable encounter with Elgar after a rehearsal of \"The Dream of Gerontius\". Sumsion earned an undergraduate degree in music from Durham University in 1920 and continued in his post at Gloucester until 1922, when he embarked for London to become organist of Christ Church, Lancaster Gate. In 1924 he took on two additional posts—director of music at Bishop's Stortford College, north of London, and a teaching position at Morley College. He also studied conducting with Adrian Boult at the Royal College of Music, though Boult observed that Sumsion's conducting technique was already well-developed.\n\nAt the Royal College of Music Sumsion also met R. O. Morris, professor of counterpoint and composition. When Morris accepted a position at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he asked Sumsion to serve as his assistant; the two, along with Morris's wife Emmie, departed for America at the end of September 1926. The Curtis Institute was then a conservatory in its infancy, but figures such as Leopold Stokowski, famed conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, were associated with it in its early days. Sumsion's decision to accompany the Morrises was of consequence to his personal life as well as his career. Emmie Morris wrote frequently to her sister Adeline (who was married to Ralph Vaughan Williams) and reported ‘with interest’ on Sumsion's courtship of an American girl, Alice Garlichs. Sumsion had been introduced to Alice through her uncle, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania whom Sumsion had met on board the ship to America. On 7 June 1927, Herbert and Alice were married in Philadelphia.\n\nOn 1 March 1928, Herbert Brewer died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving the post of organist at Gloucester vacant only a few months before the cathedral was to host the Three Choirs Festival. Brewer had expressed a desire that Sumsion succeed him, so although Sumsion had just accepted the position of organist at Coventry cathedral, the Dean and Chapter at Gloucester negotiated his release from this commitment. Sumsion and his wife left America for England in June 1928.\n\nDespite his relatively late arrival on the scene, Sumsion's leadership of the 1928 Three Choirs Festival at Gloucester impressed both music colleagues and the press. In those days the resident organist bore the burden of conducting, and though in 1928 several composers were on hand to conduct their own works—notably Elgar and the Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály—Sumsion was responsible for works such as Verdi's \"Requiem\" and Honegger's \"King David\", the latter being a Three Choirs debut. It was following the 1928 festival that Elgar made his oft-quoted pun: ‘What at the beginning of the week was \"assumption\" has now become a certainty.’\n\nA former Sumsion pupil writes that Sumsion's ‘vision in matters of programme planning together with his skill of direction in a very wide spectrum of works made him one of the most successful conductors’ in the Three Choirs Festival's history. From 1928 until his retirement in 1967, Sumsion was responsible for planning and serving as the principal conductor for eleven festivals held at Gloucester. Although Sumsion personally acknowledged the challenge that cathedral organists—who were primarily choral conductors—faced in conducting major orchestral works, his own conducting was greatly respected, and his interpretations of Elgar's works were viewed as being representative of the composer's own readings. At the first festival following Elgar's death (1934), Sumsion proposed that the three cathedral organists each conduct one of the Elgar works on the program, a welcome division of labour for the host conductor that would later become standard practice. After the retirement in 1949 of Percy Hull of Hereford and Ivor Atkins of Worcester, Sumsion remained the only direct link with Elgar amongst the musicians of the three cathedrals.\n\nIn his program planning for the festival, Sumsion championed the performance of new English works. Notable premieres at Sumsion's Gloucester festivals included Gustav Holst's \"Choral Fantasia\" (1931), Howells's \"Hymnus Paradisi\" (1950), and Finzi's \"Intimations of Immortality\" (1950); as well as works by Vaughan Williams, Howard Ferguson, Robin Milford, Tony Hewitt-Jones, John Sanders, and Sumsion himself. Outside the realm of English music, Sumsion helped sustain a festival connection with Kodály by inviting him back to Gloucester in 1937 and programming his works at six Gloucester festivals.\n\nSumsion maintained personal friendships with many of the well-known composers who frequented the festival, particularly Vaughan Williams, Finzi, and Howells. Social gatherings at the festival, in which Sumsion's wife Alice played a significant role, helped to cultivate these relationships. In 2007 Ursula Vaughan Williams still recalled that her husband had been ‘great friends’ with Herbert and Alice. Sumsion was considered part of Finzi's intimate circle and was a frequent guest at Finzi's home at Ashmansworth in Hampshire; the Sumsion and Finzi families (the Sumsions had three sons, the Finzis two) also went on holiday together. The Sumsion and Howells families were likewise close, evidenced by the fact that in 1935 the Sumsions hosted Howells and his wife for Christmas following the death of the Howells's son Michael; and according to one Howells biographer, it was Sumsion who first encouraged Howells to allow \"Hymnus Paradisi\", written in Michael's memory, to be performed.\n\nSumsion also led an active professional life outside the cathedral. He had begun composing as a young man and continued to accept commissions when he was well into his eighties. Possibly his last work was a set of hymns entitled 'Four Hymns', to words by Paul Wigmore, and published by Oecumuse in the autumn of 1995, only weeks after Sumsion's death. He composed many works for organ and choir, as well as chamber and orchestral pieces and a book of piano exercises. Sumsion also taught piano, organ, and composition privately, adjudicated at competitions, accompanied vocalists and played with chamber groups, and performed as an organ recitalist. His 1965 recording of Elgar's Organ Sonata, which he recorded in one ‘take’, is now regarded as the standard interpretation of that work. Concurrent with his post at the cathedral Sumsion served as director of music at Cheltenham Ladies’ College (1935–1968) and directed the Gloucester Choral and Orchestral Societies. As a teacher and choir trainer he was said to be demanding yet kind and encouraging, displaying ‘that rare gift that made people want to do well for him’. Sumsion was honored with a Lambeth Doctorate in 1947 and was appointed CBE in 1961.\n\nAfter retiring from Gloucester cathedral in 1967, Sumsion remained in Gloucestershire and continued to teach and compose. He helped design the fabulous Hill, Norman & Beard Chapel Organ for Ellesmere College after a fire there had totally destroyed the Chapel in 1966. He died at Frampton-on-Severn in 1995 at age 96.\n\nSumsion's compositional style reflects the influence of his more famous contemporaries Howells, Finzi, and Vaughan Williams, while at the same time retaining something of the ‘diatonic strength’ of Edwardian composers like Parry and Brewer. Despite these influences, however, Sumsion's music speaks in a fresh and distinctive voice that is appealing to both performers and listeners. His harmonic language is sturdy and conventional, yet often tinged with modality, and his melodic style is fluid and elegant. In the organ and choral works Sumsion displays a fondness for parallel thirds in the accompaniment, detached bass lines, and the descending minor third in the melody.\n\nChoral and organ music appear most often in Sumsion's output during his Gloucester tenure and retirement, with many choral pieces dating from his last decade of life. Works such as the Magnificat and Nunc dimittis in G major, the Preces and Responses, and the anthem \"They that go down to the sea in ships\" have entered the standard repertoire of Anglican church music. A new disc of Sumsion's choral music featuring the Ecclesium Choir (Philip Stopford, director) was released in 2007 as No. 9 in Priory's \"British Church Composers Series\". Sumsion's most significant work for organ is the challenging \"Introduction and Theme\", which has been recorded by Donald Hunt (among others) for the Helios label.\n\nMost of Sumsion's chamber and orchestral works were written earlier in his career and are unpublished or out of print; however a Piano Trio, the orchestral pieces \"Overture, In the Cotswolds\" and \"Idyll, At Valley Green\", and the Cello Sonata have all had public performances, the first three at various Three Choirs Festivals. David Lloyd-Jones and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia have recorded an attractive work for strings called \"A Mountain Tune\" (‘English String Miniatures’/White Line/2003), which Sumsion originally wrote for cello and piano.\n\nIn December 2014, the violinist Rupert Marshall-Luck and the pianist Duncan Honeybourne recorded for EM Records Sumsion's Violin Sonata of 1920; the recording was released in May 2015 (\"King of Instruments; Instrument of Kings\"/EM Records/EMR CD029). The work, which was suspected to have been lost, was rediscovered in the archive of Sumsion's works following correspondence between Marshall-Luck, Dr Donald Hunt and the composer's grandson, Paul Sumsion.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ion channels allow for the selective movement of certain ions across the plasma membrane in cells. More specifically, in nerve cells, along with ion transporters, they are responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the cell.\n\nG proteins are a family of intracellular proteins capable of mediating signal transduction pathways. Each G protein is a heterotrimer of three subunits: α-, β-, and γ- subunits. The α-subunit (G) typically binds the G protein to a transmembrane receptor protein known as a G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR. This receptor protein has a large, extracellular binding domain which will bind its respective ligands (e.g. neurotransmitters and hormones). Once the ligand is bound to its receptor, a conformational change occurs. This conformational change in the G protein allows G to bind GTP. This leads to yet another conformational change in the G protein, resulting in the separation of the βγ-complex (G) from G. At this point, both G and G are active and able to continue the signal transduction pathway. Different classes of G protein-coupled receptors have many known functions including the cAMP and Phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathways. A class known as metabotropic glutamate receptors play a large role in indirect ion channel activation by G proteins. These pathways are activated by second messengers which initiate signal cascades involving various proteins which are important to the cell's response.\n\nG protein-gated ion channels are associated with a specific type of G protein-coupled receptor. These ion channels are transmembrane ion channels with selectivity filters and a G protein binding site. The GPCRs associated with G protein-gated ion channels are not involved in signal transduction pathways. They only directly activate these ion channels using effector proteins or the G protein subunits themselves (see picture). Unlike most effectors, not all G protein-gated ion channels have their activity mediated by G of their corresponding G proteins. For instance, the opening of inwardly rectifying K (GIRK) channels is mediated by the binding of G.\n\nG protein-gated ion channels are primarily found in CNS neurons and atrial myocytes, and affect the flow of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and chloride (Cl) across the plasma membrane.\n\nFour G protein gated inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel subunits have been identified in mammals: GIRK1, GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4. The GIRK subunits come together to form GIRK ion channels. These ion channels, once activated, allow for the flow of potassium ions (K) from the extracellular space surrounding the cell across the plasma membrane and into the cytoplasm. Each channel consists of domains which span the plasma membrane, forming the K-selective pore region through which the K ions will flow. Both the N-and C-terminal ends of the GIRK channels are located within the cytoplasm. These domains interact directly with the βγ-complex of the G protein, leading to activation of the K channel. . These domains on the N-and C-terminal ends which interact with the G proteins contain certain residues which are critical for the proper activation of the GIRK channel. In GIRK4, the N-terminal residue is His-64 and the C-terminal residue is Leu-268; in GIRK1 they are His-57 and Leu-262, respectively. Mutations in these domains lead to the channel's desensitivity to the βγ-complex and therefore reduce the activation of the GIRK channel.\n\nThe four GIRK subunits are 80-90% similar in their pore-forming and transmembrane domains, a feature accountable by the similarities in their structures and sequences. GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4 share an overall identity of 62% with each other, while GIRK1 only shares 44% identity with the others. Because of their similarity, the GIRK channel subunits can come together easily to form heteromultimers (a protein with two or more different polypeptide chains). GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK3 show abundant and overlapping distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) while GIRK1 and GIRK4 are found primarily in the heart. GIRK1 combines with GIRK2 in the CNS and GIRK4 in the atrium to form heterotetramers; each final heterotetramer contains two GIRK1 subunits and two GIRK2 or GIRK4 subunits. GIRK2 subunits can also form homotetramers in the brain, while GIRK4 subunits can form homotetramers in the heart. GIRK1 subunits have not been shown to be able to form functional homotetramers. Though GIRK3 subunits are found in the CNS, their role in forming functional ion channels is still unknown.\n\n\nOne G protein-gated potassium channel is the inward-rectifing potassium channel (IKACh) found in cardiac muscle (specifically, the sinoatrial node and atria), which contributes to the regulation of heart rate. These channels are almost entirely dependent on G protein activation, making them unique when compared to other G protein-gated channels. Activation of the IKACh channels begins with release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the vagus nerve onto pacemaker cells in the heart. ACh binds to the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which interact with G proteins and promote the dissociation of the G subunit and G-complex. IKACh is composed of two homologous GIRK channel subunits: GIRK1 and GIRK4. The G-complex binds directly and specifically to the IKACh channel through interactions with both the GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits. Once the ion channel is activated, K ions flow out of the cell and cause it to hyperpolarize. In its hyperpolarized state, the neuron cannot fire action potentials as quickly, which slows the heartbeat.\n\n\nThe G protein inward rectifying K channel found in the CNS is a heterotetramer composed of GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits and is responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential and excitability of the neuron. Studies have shown the largest concentrations of the GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits to be in the dendritic areas of neurons in the CNS. These areas, which are both extrasynaptic (exterior to a synapse) and perisynaptic (near a synapse), correlate with the large concentration of GABA receptors in the same areas. Once the GABA receptors are activated by their ligands, they allow for the dissociation of the G protein into its individual α-subunit and βγ-complex so it can in turn activate the K channels. The G proteins couple the inward rectifying K channels to the GABA receptors, mediating a significant part of the GABA postsynpatic inhibition.\n\nFurthermore, GIRKs have been found to play a role in a group of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, specifically those associated with the neuropeptide hormone orexin. The 5-HT1A receptor, a serotonin receptor and type of GPCR, has been shown to be coupled directly with the α-subunit of a G protein, while the βγ-complex activates GIRK without use of a second messenger. The subsequent activation of the GIRK channel mediates hyperpolarization of orexin neurons, which regulate the release of many other neurotransmitters including noradrenaline and acetylcholine.\n\nIn addition to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP), G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca channels are able to survive and function in the absence of cAMP, ATP or protein kinase C when in the presence of the activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, G, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca channel directly as an effector. This short circuit is membrane-delimiting, allowing direct gating of calcium channels by G proteins to produce effects more quickly than the cAMP cascade could. This direct gating has also been found in specific Ca channels in the heart and skeletal muscle T tubules.\n\nSeveral high-threshold, slowly inactivating calcium channels in neurons are regulated by G proteins. The activation of α-subunits of G proteins has been shown to cause rapid closing of voltage-dependent Ca channels, which causes difficulties in the firing of action potentials. This inhibition of voltage-gated Calcium channels by G protein-coupled receptors has been demonstrated in the dorsal root ganglion of a chick among other cell lines. Further studies have indicated roles for both G and G subunits in the inhibition of Ca channels. The research geared to defining the involvement of each subunit, however, has not uncovered the specificity or mechanisms by which Ca channels are regulated.\n\nThe acid-sensing ion channel ASIC1a is a specific G protein-gated Ca channel. The upstream M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binds to G-class G proteins. Blocking this channel with the agonist oxotremorine methiodide was shown to inhibit ASIC1a currents. ASIC1a currents have also been shown to be inhibited in the presence of oxidizing agents and potentiated in the presence of reducing agents. A decrease and increase in acid-induced intracellular Ca accumulation were found, respectively.\n\nPatch clamp measurements suggest a direct role for G in the inhibition of fast Na current within cardiac cells. Other studies have found evidence for a second-messenger pathway which may indirectly control these channels. Whether G proteins indirectly or directly activate Na ion channels not been defined with complete certainty.\n\nChloride channel activity in epethelial and cardiac cells has been found to be G protein-dependent. However, the cardiac channel that has been shown to be directly gated by the G subunit has not yet been identified. As with Na channel inhibition, second-messenger pathways cannot be discounted in Cl channel activation.\n\nStudies done on specific Cl channels show differing roles of G protein activation. It has been shown that G proteins directly activate one type of Cl channel in skeletal muscle. Other studies, in CHO cells, have demonstrated a large conductance Cl channel to be activated differentially by CTX- and PTX-sensitive G proteins. The role of G proteins in the activation of Cl channels is a complex area of research that is ongoing.\n\nMutations in G proteins associated with G protein-gated ion channels have been shown to be involved in diseases such as epilepsy, muscular diseases, neurological diseases, and chronic pain, among others.\n\nEpilepsy, chronic pain, and addictive drugs such as cocaine, opioids, cannabinoids, and ethanol all affect neuronal excitability and heart rate. GIRK channels have been shown to be involved in seizure susceptibility, cocaine addiction, and increased tolerance for pain by opioids, cannabinoids, and ethanol. This connection suggests that GIRK channel modulators may be useful therapeutic agents in the treatment of these conditions. GIRK channel inhibitors may serve to treat addictions to cocaine, opioids, cannabinoids, and ethanol while GIRK channel activators may serve to treat withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAlcohol intoxication has been shown to be directly connected to the actions of GIRK channels. GIRK channels have a hydrophobic pocket that is capable of binding ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. When ethanol acts as an agonist, GIRK channels in the brain experience prolonged opening. This causes decreased neuronal activity, the result of which manifests as the symptoms of alcohol intoxication. The discovery of the hydrophobic pocket capable of binding ethanol is significant in the field of clinical pharmacology. Agents that can act as agonists to this binding site can be potentially useful in the creation of drugs for the treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy in which neuronal firing exceeds normal levels.\n\nStudies have shown that a link exists between channels with GIRK1 subunits and the beta-adrenergic receptor pathway in breast cancer cells responsible for growth regulation of the cells. Approximately 40% of primary human breast cancer tissues have been found to carry the mRNA which codes for GIRK1 subunits. Treatment of breast cancer tissue with alcohol has been shown to trigger increased growth of the cancer cells. The mechanism of this activity is still a subject of research.\n\nAltered cardiac regulation is common in adults diagnosed with Down syndrome and may be related to G protein-gated ion channels. The KCNJ6 gene is located on chromosome 21 and encodes for the GIRK2 protein subunit of G protein-gated K channels. People with Down Syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21, resulting in an overexpression of the GIRK2 subunit. Studies have found that recombinant mice overexpressing GIRK2 subunits show altered responses to drugs that activate G protein-gated K channels. These altered responses were limited to the sino-atrial node and atria, both areas which contain many G protein-gated K channels. Such findings could potentially lead to the development of drugs that can help regulate the cardiac sympathetic-parasympathetic imbalance in Down Syndrome adults.\n\nAtrial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) is associated with shorter action potential duration and believed to be affected by the G protein-gated K channel, I. The I channel, when activated by G proteins, allows for the flow of K across the plasma membrane and out of the cell. This current hyperpolarizes the cell, thus terminating the action potential. It has been shown that in chronic atrial fibrillation there an increase in this inwardly rectifying current because of constantly activated I channels. Increase in the current results in shorter action potential duration experienced in chronic atrial fibrillation and leads to the subsequent fibrillating of the cardiac muscle. Blocking I channel activity could be a therapeutic target in atrial fibrillation and is an area under study.\n\nGIRK channels have been demonstrated in vivo to be involved in opioid- and ethanol-induced analgesia. These specific channels have been the target of recent studies dealing with genetic variance and sensitivity to opioid analgesics due to their role in opioid-induced analgesia. Several studies have shown that when opioids are prescribed to treat chronic pain, GIRK channels are activated by certain GPCRs, namely opioid receptors, which leads to the inhibition of nociceptive transmission, thus functioning in pain relief. Furthermore, studies have shown that G proteins, specifically the Gi alpha subunit, directly activate GIRKs which were found to participate in propagation of morphine-induced analgesia in inflamed spines of mice. Research pertaining to chronic pain management continues to be performed in this field.\n\n"}

His father was an artist that aspired to turn professional, but died when Mashima was young. Living in the mountains as a child, his grandfather would bring him discarded manga that he found. After reading them, Mashima would draw from them. When he graduated high school, he entered a school specializing in teaching manga artists, but left without completing the studies. He stated that while it taught him the basics, he felt it would not help as a professional.\n\nMashima created a story on his own and brought it to manga editors, which led to entering it into a competition that he won. He made his official serialization debut the following year with \"Rave Master\" in \"Weekly Shōnen Magazine\". It ran until 2005 and was adapted into an anime titled \"Groove Adventure Rave\" from 2001 to 2002.\n\nIn 2003, he collected some of his one-shot titles into two volumes, \"Mashima-en\", which was licensed for a North American release in 2018 as a single volume under the title \"Hiro Mashima's Playground\".\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Mashima wrote \"Monster Soul\" in \"Comic BomBom\".\n\nWhile working on \"Rave\", Mashima drew the prototype for what would become \"Fairy Tail\". \"Fairy Tail\" began serialization in Kodansha's \"Weekly Shōnen Magazine\" in 2006 and has been adapted into an anime television series.\n\nMashima serialized \"Monster Hunter Orage\", an adaptation of the \"Monster Hunter\" video games, in \"Monthly Shōnen Rival\" from 2008 to 2009. Also in 2008, he drew a remake of Atsushi Kase's gag manga \"Chameleon\" for the 50th anniversary of \"Weekly Shōnen Magazine\".\n\nIn 2011, he created a crossover manga between \"Rave\" and \"Fairy Tail\" published in the May issue of \"Weekly Shōnen Magazine\". It was adapted into an original video animation released in August 2013. A special 2013 issue of \"Weekly Shōnen Magazine\" featured a small crossover between \"Fairy Tail\" and Nakaba Suzuki's \"The Seven Deadly Sins\", where each artist drew a \"yonkoma\" (four-panel comic) of the other's series. An actual crossover chapter between these two ran in December 2013.\n\nMashima's \"Fairy Tail\" has inspired several other works. From summer 2014 to July 17, 2015, \"Fairy Tail\" had its own monthly magazine titled \"Monthly Fairy Tail\", which included a prequel manga by Mashima himself titled \"Fairy Tail Zero\". In 2014, three spin-offs were released: \"\" by Yūsuke Shirato; \"Fairy Tail Blue Mistral\" by Rui Watanabe; and \"Fairy Girls\" by Boku. Another spin-off manga titled \"Fairy Tail Side Stories\" and created by Kyōta Shibano launched on July 30, 2015 in Kodansha's free \"Magazine Pocket\" mobile app.\n\nMashima listed Akira Toriyama's \"Dragon Ball\" as his favorite manga growing up, the video game series \"Dragon Quest\", and Yudetamago's \"Kinnikuman\" as inspiring him to become an artist. He also read/watched several works by Hayao Miyazaki as a child. In 2008, when asked if there were any current things that inspired him, he gave \"Code Geass\" as a response. In 2011, \"Berserk\" was stated to be his favorite manga.\n\nFor \"Rave\", Mashima's inspiration was wanting to travel the world, while for \"Fairy Tail\" it was simply sitting in bars and partying with his friends, the community aspect, but is also about young people finding their calling. He stated that while he tries to consider both his own interests and the fans' on what will happen next in \"Fairy Tail\", the fans take precedence.\n\nMashima has named his main characters after the seasons. In \"Rave\", the main character is named Haru, which is Japanese for spring. In \"Fairy Tail\", the main character is , which is the Japanese word for summer. In \"Monster Soul\", his main character is Aki (Autumn), and in \"Monster Hunter Orage\", he names a character Shiki, which is the Japanese word for seasons. He has also named a character Fuyu, which is Japanese for winter. Mashima said in an \"About.com\" interview that he did this because Japanese readers may not be familiar with western fantasy names. The main characters of both \"Rave\" and \"Fairy Tail\" do not have fathers, partly taken from Mashima's own experience of his father dying when he was young.\n\nMashima had six assistants in 2008 that worked in an 8,000 sq. feet area with seven desks, as well as a sofa and TV for video games. He revealed his schedule for \"Fairy Tail\" was script and storyboards on Monday, rough sketches the following day, and drawing and inking Wednesday through Friday. The weekend was for \"Monster Hunter\"; working on a quarter of the story each weekend and finishing by the end of the month. In 2011, he stated that he worked six days a week, for 17 hours a day. Mashima's assistants included Miki Yoshikawa, who has gone on to work on the romantic comedies \"Yankee-kun and Megane-chan (Flunk Punk Rumble)\" and \"Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches\". In 2008, together they developed a crossover one-shot story called \"Fairy Megane\" where characters from \"Yankee-kun\" decide to find part-time jobs at the \"Fairy Tail\" guild. Other assistants who have gone on to work on projects of their own were Shin Mikuni, who published \"Spray King\", and Ueda Yui, who published \"Tsukushi Biyori\".\n\n\n\n"}

Darke had a long association with the church of St Michael, Cornhill, in the City of London.\n\nDarke was born in Highbury, London the youngest son of Samuel Darke & Arundel Bourne and attended Dame Alice Owen's School. While in the RAF he married a violinist, Dora Garland, (the first woman to lead the Queen's Hall Orchestra) at St Michaels, Cornhill on 25 July 1918.\n\nHis first organist post was at Emmanuel Church, West Hampstead from 1906 to 1911. He became organist at St Michael Cornhill in 1916, and stayed there until 1966, leaving only briefly in 1941 to deputise for Boris Ord as Director of Music at King's College, Cambridge during World War II. It is widely accepted that the Cornhill Lunchtime Organ Recitals series begun by Darke in 1916 is the longest-running lunchtime organ concert series in the world; the series has flourished under his successors Richard Popplewell 1966-1979 and the present Organist, Jonathan Rennert, from 1979 to the present.

He was the national god of the Minaeans of south Arabia, and the snake was associated with him. It is also called Waddum and Wadd'ab.\n\nIn Islamic tradition, Wadd was worshipped by the Banu Kalb tribe and his idol was located in the city of Dumat al-Jandal. The idol was said to be destroyed by Khalid ibn al-Walid. He is also mentioned in the Quran as a false god of the people of Noah.\n\nWadd was the national god of Ma'in, or the Minaeans; the magic formula \"Wd'b\" or \"Wadd is [my?] father\" was written on amulets and buildings. These writings were often accompanied with a symbol; a crescent moon with the small disc of Venus.\n\nAn altar dedicated to him was erected by Minaeans living on the Greek island of Delos. The altar contains two inscriptions, one of which is in Minaean language and the other in Greek. Minaean inscription on the altar begins with symbols of three Minaean god one of which is of Wadd whose symbol is a snake. The Minaean text on the altar reads, \"Hāni' and Zayd'il [of the lineage] of Hab erected the altar of Wadd and of the deities of Ma'in at Delos.\" The Greek inscription reads, \"[Property] of Oaddos, god of the Minaeans. To Oaddos.\" He was also worshipped by Minaean colonists in Dedan (modern-day Al-`Ula) during the Lihyanite rule. A temple of Wadd evidently existed in Dedan. There is evidence from Minaean inscriptions of the presence of Levites in the temple of Wadd who according to some scholars were either as priests or cult servants who could later be promoted to higher positions.\n\nWadd was also the national god of the Awsan kingdom. It is known that in the Hellenistic era, a king of Awsan was proclaimed as \"son of (god) Wadd\", receiving offerings as if he himself were a god.\n\nThe theophoric name Abd Wadd is attested in the name of Amr ibn Abd Wadd, a champion of the tribe of Quraish who challenged the Muslims for a duel during the Battle of the Trench. Ali, Muhammad's son-in-law and cousin, accepted the challenge and killed Amr.\n\nAccording to Hisham ibn al-Kalbi's \"Book of Idols\", the Banu Kalb tribe worshipped Wadd in the form of a man and is said to have represented heaven. His idol and temple stood in Dumat al-Jandal, and Malik ibn Harithah, a former devotee of Wadd, describes his idol:\nlt was the statue of a huge man, as big as the largest of human beings, covered with two robes, clothed with the one and cloaked with the other, carrying a sword on his waist and a bow on his shoulder, and holding in [one] hand a spear to which was attached a standard, and [in the other] a quiver full of arrows.\n\nHe is mentioned in the Qur'an (71:23) as a deity of the time of the Prophet Noah.\n\nAnd they say: By no means leave your gods, nor leave Wadd, nor Suwa'; nor Yaghuth, and Ya'uq and Nasr.

Some have glass panels that can be opened, in order for the spectators to feel closer to and more immersed in the action of the event. However at some tennis venues (where stadiums are smaller) the luxury boxes might be located at the lowest ring of seats, nearest to the playing court.\n\nThe inside of a luxury box typically includes a bar, televisions, a small seating area, and a private bathroom. The boxes are usually catered, with guests enjoying corporate hospitality, with champagne, canapés, shrimp, and sushi being common favorites. The lease to a box usually comes with allocated parking spaces at the venue and access is usually provided with separate entrances, away from the general public gates.\n\nLuxury boxes are a significant source of revenue for most professional sports teams and venue owners. Since the late 1990s, it has been proven that luxury suites and club seating are lucrative revenue-generating features that make pro sports teams financially successful in order to remain competitive long-term. While originally widespread among North American major pro sports, this trend is also gaining popularity in Europe. For instance, Emirates Stadium's revenue from premium seating and corporate boxes alone is nearly as high as the revenue from Arsenal F.C.'s previous stadium at Highbury.\n\nParticularly in North American major professional sports leagues, luxury suite revenue does not have to be shared unlike gate receipts which are split with visiting teams, leading to teams demanding new venues that contain more luxury boxes.\n\nMost luxury suites are leased by contract on a yearly basis, though some are bought in a manner similar to that for a condominium. These methods usually grant access to the box by the leaseholder or owner for every event held at the venue. A few venues rent them on a per-event basis. Prices vary from US$5,000 up to the millions of dollars depending on the venue and events held there.\n\nSome have commented that the rise of the luxury box, along with club seating, has degraded the game-day experience for the average fan, because placement of the boxes has moved the upper decks higher and farther away from the playing surface. Three current North American venues, Ford Field, Red Bull Arena, and Levi's Stadium, have addressed these concerns by placing all luxury boxes on one side of the playing surface, which allows the other sides of the venue to have closer sightlines than most modern venues. State Farm Arena in Atlanta formerly had all of its premium seating on one side of the arena; however, renovations that took place during 2017 removed the upper level luxury boxes and were replaced with a traditional upper deck and premium seating spread throughout the arena.\n\nLuxury boxes that are rented on a single event basis can range from US$500 for low-key events to up to at least US$250,000 for high-end events such as sporting final matches. Also, the location of the box and how many people the box can hold usually makes up the price. Standing room tickets may also be purchased at an additional fee but are usually less money than an actual suite ticket. If a normal box ticket with a seat costs US$500 per ticket then standing room tickets might be around US$250–US$300 per ticket. These tickets will allow more people in a box, but they won't have seats and will have to stand in the box or sit in the lounge area.\n\nAverage private box rental prices for events vary based on location, matchup, and venue. Typical luxury boxes for most events fall within the following price ranges:\n\nThe stadium with the most luxury boxes is the Estadio Monumental \"U\" in Lima, Peru: with 1,251. The first stadium to contain a luxury box was the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, built in 1965. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway constructed their first luxury boxes (dubbed the \"Turn Two Suites\") in 1973 as part of the existing motel complex on the grounds. One unique set of luxury boxes is located on the campus of Boston College. The school's main indoor arena, Conte Forum (also known as Kelley Rink for hockey games), is directly attached to its football venue, Alumni Stadium. Some of the luxury boxes in the combined complex overlook both the stadium's playing field and the arena floor. The University of South Dakota later borrowed Boston College's concept when it built the Sanford Coyote Sports Center, which opened in 2016 as the new home for the school's basketball and volleyball teams. Several boxes at the Sports Center allow their users to watch games at both the arena and the attached DakotaDome, home to USD football.\n\nLuxury boxes have become a feature of the major professional sports league system in North America. The Palace of Auburn Hills' large number of luxury suites was a pioneer for the building boom of modern-style NBA arenas in the 1990s. The Detroit Pistons played in The Palace from its opening in 1988 through the 2016–17 season, by which time it was one of the NBA's oldest arenas. Nonetheless, The Palace's forward-thinking design contained the amenities that most NBA teams sought in newer arenas. The Pistons moved to the new Little Caesars Arena in midtown Detroit for the 2017–18 season, by which time only one of the five other NBA venues that opened in the 1988–89 season was still in use—the Bradley Center, which was replaced in 2018 by Fiserv Forum and then demolished in early 2019. Three of those five have been demolished (Amway Arena, Charlotte Coliseum, and Miami Arena), and the other, Sleep Train Arena, was replaced in 2016.\n\nTop-tier European pro association football teams have moved to new stadiums designed with a large number of luxury boxes, such as Benfica, Bayern Munich, Arsenal, and Juventus. Other clubs such as Real Madrid and Manchester United have extensively renovated their existing stadiums to add large numbers of luxury boxes.\n\nMost notable in their use of luxury boxes is the National Football League. Under the NFL's current revenue sharing agreement, teams must forfeit a large portion of their ticket revenues so that the funds can be redistributed among all the teams, particularly those in smaller markets. However, the luxury boxes, quickly becoming a top source of revenue for the franchises, were exempted from this sharing requirement.\n\nFurthermore, the NFL's blackout rule has led stadium operators to sacrifice seating capacity in favor of the luxury boxes, as it makes a sell-out easier with a lower total number of regular seats. Teams have used the threat of relocation to press state and local governments for financial assistance to either build new stadiums or renovate older venues.\n\nClub seating, club-level seating, or premium seating is a special section of seating in modern sports stadiums and arenas. These may be known by different terms, such as \"Legends Suite seats\" at Yankee Stadium or \"Platinum Club\" at Scotiabank Arena. Club-level seating is open to the elements, as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes, which gives more of an outdoor impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas. Club-level seating is typically considered a more exclusive class of seating than elsewhere in the venue, other than the luxury boxes.\n\nClub-level seating can either be sold as individual tickets, or marketed on a contract basis (similar to luxury suites) to allow for maximum profit on the part of the venue. This gives club seats more flexibility for individuals and small companies, while luxury boxes can typically only be leased by large corporations willing to pay around $500,000 USD or higher a year. Like luxury suites, club seating generates much higher revenues than regular seating.\n\nWhile luxury boxes and personal seat licenses have been around since the 1960s, club-level seating is a recent innovation of the 1990s. The mid-stage is the optimal placement for luxury boxes in order to give them good sightlines to make them attractive for lessees, however only a limited number of luxury boxes can be placed there, as adding too many mid-level boxes will reduce seating capacity and degrade the viewing experience for other parts of the venue. For the area/stadium designer, club-level seating can be implemented in the middle tier at lower cost and less space than having all luxury boxes.\n\nClub levels normally provide fans several additional amenities than standard seating. The seats themselves are often wider and more comfortable than regular seats. The club level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the venue exclusive to fans with special tickets. These areas are air conditioned and allow access to special restaurants, merchandise stands, and lounge areas of the venue that are not otherwise available to standard ticketholders. Concession stands and vendors on the club level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the club. These areas are closed off to the rest of the venue, and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive, private club entrances. Parking and concierge service are often available to club levels. The ratio of toilets to fans is considerably higher in the club level than general seating, avoiding the long washroom lineups that plague regular admission fans.\n\nThe club level is usually located towards the middle of the stage of seating sections, above the lower deck but below the upper deck. They are usually situated near the luxury boxes, whether right above, right below, or sandwiched between two levels of luxury boxes. Unlike some luxury box levels, most club levels do not wrap entirely around the venue. Some club levels stop at a certain point, giving way to an expansion of the mezzanine, while others give way to lower-class luxury boxes (such as \"party suites\"). A notable exception to this is Emirates Stadium in London, which has a complete tier of club seating. Some venues such as the MetLife Stadium have luxury suites that are not completely enclosed and come with exposed seats similar to those at club level.\n"}

He was the highest-ranking African American in ISKCON. Bhakti Tirtha Swami met with figures such as Nelson Mandela and Zambia's president Kenneth Kaunda, was frequently interviewed in the media, wrote 17 books on religious topics and led community development projects in the United States and other countries. He was the founder and director of the Institute for Applied Spiritual Technology in Washington, DC, \"a nonprofit, nondenominational organization whose membership represents a variety of spiritual paths and professional backgrounds\". He traveled frequently and served as a spiritual consultant. He also served as chairman of the Third World Coalition. On February 7, 2006 the Council of the District of Columbia recognized him for dedication to social change for residents in the District of Columbia.\n\nBhakti Tirtha Swami was born John Edwin Favors on February 25, 1950 into a Christian family living in Cleveland, Ohio, US. His parents instilled in him the values of self-confidence, religiosity and a spirit of generosity demonstrated by giving to persons less fortunate than oneself. As a child, John Favors appeared on television to preach Christianity. He excelled in his academic achievements while attending East Technical High School in Cleveland and received a scholarship to attend the prestigious Hawken School, where he spent an additional year of college preparation in philosophy and political science. While at Hawken, he was a member of the football and wrestling teams.\n\nIn 1968 he came to Princeton University. While at Princeton, he partook as a leader in Martin Luther King's civil rights movement being \"at the forefront of political activism on campus, a leader of the Association of Black Collegians (ABC) and a founder of the Third World Center\". He also served as a president of the student council. In 1972, he earned a B.A. in psychology and African American studies.\nAttending lectures at the university and reading books on different subjects, \"he began feeling the futility of acquiring knowledge, which would become obsolete very soon\". After Princeton, he joined the Hare Krishna Movement and \"began a career of worldwide travel, study, teaching, lecturing, and writing\". On February 16, 1973 in Los Angeles he was initiated into the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition by ISKCON's founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whereupon he was given the name \"Ghanashyam Dasa\" (meaning servant of Krishna). In the 1970s, Ghanashyam Dasa preached Gaudiya Vaishnavism in Eastern Europe by distributing religious books and working with scholars.\n\nOn March 13, 1979 during Gaura-purnima festival at New Vrindaban, he was initiated into the Vaishnava sannyasa order of renunciation by Kirtanananda Swami and given the name \"Bhakti Tirtha Swami\". In the same year, he became the first devotee of the Hare Krishna Movement to visit Nigeria and preach there. In 1990, he was crowned as high chief in Warri, Nigeria. Later he went on to become a senior leader and one of the most prominent preachers within ISKCON and a member of its management body known as the Governing Body Commission. He was the first person of African descent to become an initiating guru in the disciplic succession of the ancient Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya. As a religious leader, Bhakti-tirtha Swami made a friendship with celebrities and served as a spiritual consultant, specializing in international relations and conflict resolution to high-ranking members of the United Nations and world leaders, including former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela. Ex-member of ISKCON Nori Muster, who worked for ten years as a public relations secretary and editor of ISKCON's newspaper, the \"ISKCON World Review\", recalls in her book:\n\nIn 1990, Bhakti Tirtha Swami was crowned High Chief in Warri, Nigeria, West Africa in recognition of the reputable work he performed there. Bhakti Tirtha Swami died June 27, 2005, of complications from melanoma, at Gita Nagari, the Gaudiya Vaishnava community in central Pennsylvania. Bhakti Tirtha Swami is survived by four sisters, Bernadette Satterfield, Julia Henderson, Frances Myers, and Marguerite Brooks; a brother, Paul Favors; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nOn February 7, 2006, the Council of the District of Columbia adopted ceremonial resolution, in which it \"recognized His Holiness Bhakti Tirtha Swami Krishnapada for dedication to social change that has impacted civil and human rights for residents in the District of Columbia\".\n\nIn 2007, his biography was released, entitled \"Black Lotus: The Spiritual Journey of an Urban Mystic,\" the 410-page book is complete with full-color pictures, interviews with loved ones, and comprehensive Index.

She is known for being one of a number of Czech women who were allegedly ordained priests, the religious result of which is in dispute.\n\nJavorová was born into a Catholic family, and expressed a wish to become a nun, but that was not possible in the time of communism. She started to work in civilian professions and to support Church activities in her free time.\n\nAccording to statements made in 1995 and later, the underground bishop Felix Maria Davídek, who was a friend of her family, secretly ordained Javorová on December 28, 1970, during the early years of Soviet occupation of the country after the Prague Spring. She had served as his secretary and deputy after his return from prison in 1964 and \"gradually took over important tasks in organising the clandestine Church structure Koinótés.\" Davídek named her his vicar general and later ordained her a priest.\n\nAfter communist rule in Czechoslovakia ended in 1989, Javorová seemingly tried for some time to conceal her status from the public, saying that \"the time is not ripe to talk about that\". About 1995 she changed her mind and decided to speak. She helped to prepare a book interview about her experiences, authored by Miriam Therese Winter. Javorová now lives in Brno and remains an active member of the Roman Catholic Church. She is currently a speaker of the Liturgical Commission of her local parish.\n\nWhile there appears to be no evidence that an ordination ceremony did or did not take place as claimed, its theological significance is in controversy.\n\nOn one side, Davidek justified the ordinations by the pastoral needs of a church suffering harsh persecution (he himself endured fourteen years in Communist prison for his faith) and in particular, of women tortured in prison who had no access to male priests but may have been ministered to by priests of the same gender. Archbishop John Bukovsky is quoted as saying that the ordinations were \"illicit but valid\".\n\nOn the other side, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that an ordination ceremony performed on a woman would be invalid as well as illicit; this doctrine is found in the writings of Thomas Aquinas and many others. Pope John Paul II has written \"Priestly ordination, which hands on the office entrusted by Christ to his Apostles of teaching, sanctifying and governing the faithful, has in the Catholic Church from the beginning always been reserved to men alone\" in his Apostolic Letter, \"Ordinatio sacerdotalis\". This is reflected in the current Code of Canon Law.\n\nThe group Roman Catholic Womenpriests dispute this doctrine.\n\nWithin Davídek's group itself, the ordination of women and of married men was highly controversial and may have played a role in its splitting in the early 1970s. Davídek himself concealed Javorová's ordination from many of his co-workers and demanded written promises of \"absolute silence on the matter\" from people participating in his secret ordinations. Historians Fiala and Hanuš conclude that these ordained women (there were about five, Javorová being the only publicly known) found very few specific sacerdotal tasks in the Davídek's group, and conclude from this that their ordinations can therefore be considered as only a \"symbolical act and a precedent\".\n\nChristian publisher - who had met Javorova - said in an interview that the ordination had been real, but was invalidated by the Vatican after the fall of the communist regime.\n\n\n"}

The General is elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army and serves a term of five years, which may be extended to seven years. Brian Peddle, the current general, assumed the position in August 2018 upon the retirement of Andre Cox. The organisation's founder, William Booth, was the first and longest-serving general. There have been 21 generals as of 2018.\n\nUsage of the term \"general\" began with the founder of The Salvation Army, William Booth. His wife, Catherine Booth, the organisation's co-founder, became known as the \"Mother\" of The Salvation Army. General Booth served as general until his death in 1912; Booth selected his son, Bramwell Booth as his successor. It was William Booth's intention to have each general choose his successor, but the Salvation Army Act of 1931 passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom requires that each general is selected by the High Council of The Salvation Army. Every general since Bramwell Booth has been selected by the High Council.. In accordance with the Salvation Army Act of 1931, a general must \"retire\" at age 68 and may serve as long as seven years. The general is elected by the High Council when his predecessor retires or dies (known within the Salvation Army as being promoted to Glory). William Booth was the only general to die in office. The High Council is composed of the Chief of the Staff, all active commissioners, except the spouse of the incumbent general, and all territorial commanders. The High Council may also remove a general from office for violations of his \"covenant to God\", disability, or the inability to fulfill his duties, though this has never happened. \n\nThe officer of the Salvation Army who is elected general is the worldwide spiritual leader of the Salvation Army and the chief executive officer of the organization. The general has a role that is similar to the Pope's role within the Catholic Church. Since The Salvation Army maintains a hierarchical, quasi-military structure, all appointments and regulations are issued under the general's authority. \n\nThree women have been elected General of the Salvation Army: Evangeline Booth, William Booths's daughter, in 1934, Eva Burrows in 1986, and Linda Bond in 2011. \n\nOn January 31, 2011, after 10 days of meetings which began on January 21, 2011, the 17th High Council elected Linda Bond as the 19th General of The Salvation Army. Bond was the third woman to hold the post and the fourth Canadian. This election was handled by the largest High Council in history and was especially significant due to the number of women delegates (57) outnumbering the number of men delegates (52).\n\nOn 3 August 2013 the then-Commissioner Andre Cox was elected by the High Council of 2013 as the 20th General of The Salvation Army. The High Council of 2018 selected Brian Peddle as Cox's successor in May 2018; he took office in August 2018. \n\nAs of May 2020, there are five retired generals living. The most recent general to die was Bramwell Tillsley in November 2019. \n\nThe general serves as the Chief executive officer (CEO) of The Salvation Army at the international level, but the organization is divided into many subunits controlled by other individuals. For instance, Commissioner David Hudson, appointed by Cox, serves as the CEO of The Salvation Army of the United States.\n\nBelow is a timeline of Salvation Army Generals' terms in office. \n"}

He was also the Prime Minister from 9 November 2009 to 13 June 2011. He is the second son of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, who was assassinated in 2005. Hariri has also been the leader of the Future Movement party since 2005. He is seen as \"the strongest figurehead\" of the March 14 Alliance. After three years living overseas, he returned to Lebanon on 8 August 2014 and was designated Prime Minister on 3 November 2016. Hariri's surprise announcement of an intent to resign, broadcast on 4 November 2017 on Saudi state TV, has widely been seen as part of the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict in Lebanon, and triggered a dispute between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. The resignation was later suspended, following President Michel Aoun's request to \"put it on hold ahead of further consultations\". On October 29, 2019, amid the 2019–20 Lebanese protests, Hariri announced his resignation, and that of his cabinet.\n\nSaad Hariri was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on 18 April 1970, and is the son of Rafic Hariri and his first wife Nidal Bustani, an Iraqi. In addition to his native Arabic, Hariri speaks English, French and Italian. He graduated in 1992 from the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University with a degree in business administration.\n\nPrior to entering politics, Hariri was the chairman of the executive committee of Oger Telecom, which pursued telecommunication interests in the Middle East and Africa, from 1994 to 2005. In addition, Hariri was the chairman of Omnia Holdings and a board member of Oger International Entreprise de Travaux Internationaux, Saudi Oger, Saudi Investment Bank, Saudi Research and Marketing Group and Lebanese television channel Future TV.\n\nOn 20 April 2005, the Hariri family announced that Saad Hariri would lead the Future Movement, an essentially Sunni movement that was created and led by his late father. He was the leader of the March 14 Alliance, a coalition of political groups born out of the Cedar Revolution which, through mass popular demonstrations and Western support, led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon in 2005 after a 29-year presence.\n\nHariri was first elected prime minister from 9 November 2009 until 13 June 2011. \n\nOn 12 January 2011, minutes after Hariri posed for pictures with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, the opposition parties resigned from his unity government cabinet, causing its collapse. The withdrawal of Hezbollah and its allies was due to political tensions arising from investigations into the assassination of Rafic Hariri. Hezbollah operatives had been accused of the assassination of Rafic Hariri.\n\nHariri continued on for four months as caretaker Prime Minister. The new Lebanese government was formed on 13 June 2011 and headed by Najib Mikati. Mikati created an 8 March-led government coalition.\n\nOn 12 December 2012, Syria issued a warrant for the arrest of Hariri, Future bloc deputy Okab Sakr and Free Syrian Army official Louay Almokdad on charges of arming and providing financial support for Syrian opposition groups. Hariri released a statement in response, describing Bashar Assad as a \"monster\".\n\nFollowing more than two years of deadlock in electing a president, Michel Aoun was elected. Shortly after, Aoun signed a decree appointing Hariri as prime minister for the second time and he took office on 18 December 2016.\n\nOn 4 November 2017, in a televised statement from Saudi Arabia, Hariri tendered his resignation from office, citing Iran’s and Hezbollah's political over-extension in the Middle East region and fears of assassination. Iran vehemently rejected Saad Hariri's remarks and called his resignation part of a plot by the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia to heighten Middle Eastern tensions. The Lebanese Army responded with a statement that intelligence in its possession in addition to ongoing arrests and investigations had not revealed “the presence of any plan for assassinations in the country.”\n\nMost Iran-leaning or Shia-aligned Lebanese groups, including Hezbollah, were among the first to accuse Saudi Arabia of holding Hariri hostage; Hariri's associates and Saudi officials subsequently denied this. Several Lebanese commentators poked fun at the released pictures of Hariri in Saudi Arabia for their apparent similarity to those taken of hostages. Anti-Hezbollah blogger Michael Young stated that he did not think Hariri was an actual hostage of the Saudi regime, but that the situation confirmed Hariri's close ties with them. However, Lebanese-American political scientist As'ad AbuKhalil claimed that the Saudis had jailed and physically restrained and assaulted Hariri before ordering him to broadcast his resignation. In November, it was announced that Hariri was on his way from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates. Hariri's own party's media outlet reported that he would then move on to Bahrain and later back to Beirut, but both of these trips were subsequently cancelled and he was sent back to Riyadh. Hariri's allies, who usually aligned with Saudi Arabia, then joined the other parties in their concern for Hariri's freedom being limited by Saudi Arabia. The majority of the Lebanese government requested his return. On 11 November, Lebanese President Michel Aoun released the statement: \"Lebanon does not accept its prime minister being in a situation at odds with international treaties and the standard rules in relations between states.\"\n\nLater in November, Hariri left for France to meet French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron specifically requested he take his wife and children along with him. He was able to make such a request due to Hariri's French citizenship. Hariri declared in Beirut on 21 November that he had suspended his resignation. He stated that President Michel Aoun had asked him to \"put it on hold ahead of further consultations\". He refused to talk about what happened in Saudi Arabia and claimed that events will remain undisclosed. He rescinded his resignation on 5 December and stated that all members of the government had agreed to stay out of conflicts in Arab countries.\n\nIn mid-October 2019, a popular protest movement began calling for increased accountability and transparency in politics. His government was widely viewed as corrupt by the Lebanese people. On 29 October, Hariri offered his resignation as a concession, saying \"This is in response to the will and demand of the thousands of Lebanese demanding change\". The following day, President Michel Aoun accepted the resignation but requested that Hairi remain in office till a successor was appointed. Hassan Diab, the former Education minister was appointed to the role on 21 January 2020. \n\nIn 2007, French president Jacques Chirac awarded Saad Hariri the Légion d'honneur, a French order of merit.\n\nSaad Hariri born in 1970 in Riyadh is the second son of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri and his first wife Nidal Bustani, an Iraqi. He has an older brother Bahaa Hariri (born 1967) and another brother Houssam Hariri who died young in a traffic accident. After his parents divorced, his father married Nazik Hariri (née Audi) in 1976. Saad Hariri has two half-brothers and one half-sister from his father's second marriage: Ayman Hariri, (born 1978), Fahd Hariri, (born c. 1980/81) and Hind Hariri, a sister (born 1984).\n\nHariri holds multiple citizenships: Lebanese, Saudi Arabian and French.

During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force. He is best known for his choral setting of \"Adam lay ybounden\", his only published composition.\n\nBernhard Ord was born at Clifton, Bristol, the youngest son of Clement Ord, a lecturer at the University of Bristol, and Johanna Anthes. Having a German mother, Ord's given name was Bernhardt, but he was later universally known by his nickname, Boris.\n\nOrd was educated at Clifton College, Bristol – as was his successor, Sir David Willcocks – and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was the John Stewart of Rannoch scholar in Sacred Music.\n\nOrd graduated from Clifton in 1914 aged 17, and he went to study at the Royal College of Music on an organ scholarship under Walter Parratt. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I and Ord went to serve as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps. After the war, he returned to the Royal College to continue his musical studies. In 1920, Ord won an organ scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. During his time there, he was very active in the musical life of the university and founded the Cambridge University Madrigal Society, in recognition of which he was awarded a Cambridge Fellowship in 1923.\n\nOrd spent a year working at the Cologne Opera in 1928, before returning to Cambridge as a conductor. In 1936, Ord became director of the Cambridge University Musical Society.\n\nIn 1929, Boris Ord took the position of Organist of King's College, Cambridge, a role which placed him in charge of the chapel choir. He was assisted by an organ scholar, a role held from 1934 by David Willcocks.\n\nDuring his tenure at King's, Ord began to introduce more 16th-century music into the choral repertoire, replacing much of the Victorian music favoured by his predecessor, Arthur Henry Mann. Ord became well acquainted with the Dean of the college, Rev Eric Milner-White, who originally devised the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols in 1918. When the Nine Lessons was first televised in 1954 by BBC Television, the choir was conducted by Ord.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, both Ord and Willcocks left King's to join the armed forces. Ord served in an administrative role in the Royal Air Force, now being considered too old to fly. The composer Harold Darke deputised for Ord during that period.\n\nIn the mid 1950s, Ord began to suffer from disseminated sclerosis, and it was decided to split Ord's role into two new positions. Ord took on the new title of \"Director of Music\", while Willcocks was appointed to the role of Organist. Ord retired in 1957, and Willcocks took over his role under the title \"Organist and Director of Music\", a title which has since been held by all his successors.\n\nOrd was widely known within the music profession to be homosexual, and he never married.\n\nBoris Ord died on 30 December 1961 and his body was cremated on 5 January 1962 at Cambridge crematorium. His ashes were interred in King's College chapel.\n\nOrd is known for his only published piece of music, a choral setting of a medieval text, \"Adam lay ybounden\", written in 1957. Ord's carol is frequently performed at the popular annual service Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's, sometimes alternating with the other settings by Peter Warlock and Philip Ledger.\n\nJacobs A. \"A New Dictionary of Music 3rd edition\".

It is near the scenic limestone promontory of Sand Point and Middle Hope, owned by the National Trust, beside the Severn Estuary about north-east of Weston-super-Mare, within the English unitary authority of North Somerset. Many of the buildings are Grade I listed, and the whole site is scheduled as an ancient monument.\n\nThe priory was founded, by William de Courtney, in the early 13th century, and dedicated to Thomas Becket. The small community built a church and monastic lodgings during the next hundred years. They were Victorine Canons who were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and self-sufficiency so that the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm, as well as providing clergy for surrounding churches. Despite endowments of land the priory was not wealthy until the 15th century when further building work, including the current priory church, infirmary and barn was undertaken. It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune. The following year the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work, and now rent out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation.\n\nThe surviving buildings include the priory church, which was a 15th-century replacement for the earlier 13th-century structure, infirmary, barn and 16th-century prior's lodging which was converted into a farmhouse. The whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain, the sacristy, refectory, chapter house, lady chapel and parlour having been demolished. The former district council and parliamentary constituency both took their name from the priory.\n\nThe priory was founded in the early 13th century, and dedicated to Thomas Becket. The founder, William de Courtney, was a grandson of Reginald Fitzurse, one of Becket's murderers. In 1849 a reliquary was found in St Paul's Church, Kewstoke that was believed to have come originally from the priory and to contain the blood of Thomas Becket. It is believed that it was moved to St Paul's for safe keeping at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The first building had been completed by 1242 as it is described in a letter to Jocelin of Wells. In 1283 John de Botetourt, 1st Baron Botetourt, the warden of the Forest of Dean was instructed to deliver ten oaks from the forest to the Prior of Woodspring. The foundation was confirmed by Edward II in 1325. It was home to a small community of Victorine Canons. The Victorine order were founded at the Abbey of St. Victor, Paris and founded St Augustine's Abbey in Bristol which became Bristol Cathedral. Members of the priory were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and self-sufficiency so that the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm. The priory also provided the clergy for the local parish Church of St Paul, Kewstoke.\n\nThe priory, along with other religious houses such as Glastonbury Abbey and Wells Cathedral, was responsible for draining some of the mudflats and salt marshes of the Somerset Levels. William de Courtenay gave the manors of Woodspring, Worle and Locking to the priory, however it was not rich for most of its existence, with William Button giving a legacy of 210 marks in 1277. In 1317, although the first church buildings were complete, however it had not been consecrated and Bishop Drokensford therefore fined them 20 shillings. Further financial difficulties arose when, during the outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 they had to appoint successive clergy to local churches, and the church suffered a fire in the priory church. In the 15th and early 16th centuries an unknown benefactor enabled expansion and new building work to be undertaken. There is some speculation that some of the funding may have come from smugglers who were able to land their craft close to the priory and avoid customs duties. The priory church and the great barn were constructed along with a part of the prior's lodging.\n\nIn 1536 Henry VIII, through a series of administrative and legal processes disbanded monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England. He appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided for their former members and functions. He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy, passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him \"Supreme Head\" of the Church in England, thus separating England from Papal authority, and by the First Suppression Act (1536) and the Second Suppression Act (1539). Roger Tormenton had been elected prior of Woodspring in 1525 and in 1534 he acknowledged the king's supremacy, having already sold a third of the prior's property to Thomas Horner of Mells Manor, but on 27 September 1536 the community was disbanded with revenues of £87 2s 11d. Some of the priory's treasures were distributed to nearby churches. In addition to the reliquary going to St Paul's in Kewstoke, the carved misericords went to St Martin's in Worle and the sculpted pulpit to the Church of St Lawrence in Wick St. Lawrence.\n\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the priory was granted to William St Loe and leased to Edward Fetyplace of Donnington, Berkshire who converted it into a farmhouse. The chancel was demolished, a second floor was constructed in the north aisle and large windows were bricked up. In 1566 it was sold to William Carr the MP for Bristol who completed the conversion from priory to manor house. In the late 17th century it was inherited by the Pigott family who owned it for 200 years, including the Smyth-Pigotts who were related to the Smyth family who owned Ashton Court. In the 17th century it was owned by Ralph Hopton who was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War.\n\nDuring the post medieval period until the early 18th century it served as a hospital for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins. According to the findings of later resistivity and gradiometer surveys there may also have been a formal Tudor garden and there may have been fish ponds.\n\nThe farmhouse was damaged by fire in 1897. In 1926 the owner, Somerset cricketer Major Vernon Hill, offered the priory for sale to the local council, but the council did not purchase it. Major and Mrs Hill continued to own the priory until 1928, when it was bought by the Agricultural Land Company and rented to local farmers. In 1932 it was the venue for Alan Cobham's Flying Circus providing aviation displays. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune.\n\nThe decaying priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust in 1969. In the subsequent 20 years restoration work was undertaken. Initially this was to the church and infirmary with the removal of ivy and removal and replacement of the roofs. The infirmary walls had to be held in place by a concrete ring beam.\n\nThe church is now a small museum with photographs and information about the history of the priory and its renovation by the Landmark Trust, while the attached lodging house is rented out as holiday accommodation.\n\nThe 15th-century barn, east cloister wall, farmhouse range, gatehouse, gates and mounting block, infirmary, and west wall are all listed buildings.\n\nThe whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain. The sacristy, refectory, chapter house, lady chapel and parlour having been demolished. The gatehouse, gates, mounting block with six steps and west wall can also be seen attached to the farmhouse.\n\nThe original 13th-century church no longer stands, however the current church which is in perpendicular style has a two bay nave, north aisle and two stage crossing tower, which is high. The tower stands on the 13th-century base from which the short stair turret and traceried windows can still be seen. The quatrefoil parapet is from 1829. The west front includes both triassic stone from the 13th-century building and Dundry stone from the 15th. The main door is partially blocked up and serves as a window and the large upper windows have also been blocked up.\nThe 16th-century prior's lodging which was converted into a two storey farmhouse had major alterations and extensions in 1701. Inside the building are massive beams. The pentice was added in the 19th century. The 15th-century barn, which is approximately north west of the church has seven bays supported by buttresses with diagonal buttresses at the corners. It has a collar beam roof. It has a well at the eastern end. The old infirmary was built in the 15th century and has an arch braced collar beam roof. The south wall shows the site where a stair turret was included, which would have linked the ground floor infirmary chapel with the infirmarer's quarters, which have both been demolished.\n\nThe priory gave its name to the Woodspring District of the former county of Avon, which existed from 1974 to 1996 but is now known as North Somerset. Between 1983 and 2010 the parliamentary constituency known as Woodspring also took its name from the priory.\n\n\n"}

For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions. Adaptive control is different from robust control in that it does not need \"a priori\" information about the bounds on these uncertain or time-varying parameters; robust control guarantees that if the changes are within given bounds the control law need not be changed, while adaptive control is concerned with control law changing itself.\n\nThe foundation of adaptive control is parameter estimation, which is a branch of system identification. Common methods of estimation include recursive least squares and gradient descent. Both of these methods provide update laws which are used to modify estimates in real time (i.e., as the system operates). Lyapunov stability is used to derive these update laws and show convergence criteria (typically persistent excitation; relaxation of this condition are studied in Concurrent Learning adaptive control). Projection and normalization are commonly used to improve the robustness of estimation algorithms.\n\nIn general, one should distinguish between:\n\n\nas well as between\n\nDirect methods are ones wherein the estimated parameters are those directly used in the adaptive controller. In contrast, indirect methods are those in which the estimated parameters are used to calculate required controller parameters. Hybrid methods rely on both estimation of parameters and direct modification of the control law.\n\nThere are several broad categories of feedback adaptive control (classification can vary):\n\n\nSome special topics in adaptive control can be introduced as well:\n\nAdaptive control has even been merged with intelligent techniques such as fuzzy and neural networks and the new terms like fuzzy adaptive control has been generated.\n\nWhen designing adaptive control systems, special consideration is necessary of convergence and robustness issues. Lyapunov stability is typically used to derive control adaptation laws and show .\n\n\nUsually these methods adapt the controllers to both the process statics and dynamics. In special cases the adaptation can be limited to the static behavior alone, leading to adaptive control based on characteristic curves for the steady-states or to extremum value control, optimizing the steady state. Hence, there are several ways to apply adaptive control algorithms.\n\nA particularly successful application of adaptive control has been adaptive flight control. This body of work has focused on guaranteeing stability of a model reference adaptive control scheme using Lyapunov arguments. Several successful flight-test demonstrations have been conducted, including fault tolerant adaptive control.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020710", "title": "Apple's transition to Intel processors", "text": "Apple's transition to Intel processors\n\nApple's Intel Transition was the process of changing the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of Macintosh computers from PowerPC processors to Intel x86 processors. The transition became public knowledge at the 2005 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), when Apple's CEO Steve Jobs made the announcement that the company would make a transition from the use of PowerPC microprocessors supplied by Freescale (formerly Motorola) and IBM in its Macintosh computers, to processors designed and manufactured by Intel, a chief supplier for most of Apple's competitors.\n\nThe transition marked the Macintosh platform's second migration to a new CPU architecture. The first was the switch from the Motorola 68000 (\"68k\") series architecture (used since the original Macintosh 128K) to the PowerPC architecture.\n\nApple's initial press release indicated the transition would begin by June 2006, and finish by the end of 2007, but it actually proceeded much more quickly. The first generation Intel-based Macintoshes were released in January 2006 with Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger, and Steve Jobs announced the last models to switch in August 2006, with the Mac Pro available immediately and with the Intel Xserve available by October 2006. The Xserve servers were available in December 2006.\n\nApple released Mac OS X v10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" on August 28, 2009 as Intel-only, removing support for the PowerPC architecture. It is also the last Mac OS X version that supports PowerPC-based applications, as Mac OS X v10.7 \"Lion\" dropped support for Rosetta.\n\n\nThe names of some of Apple's desktop and laptop product lines changed between the PowerPC version and the corresponding Intel version. Most notably, the word \"Power\" was dropped from all product lines. During the Keynote address at Macworld in 2006, where the first Intel-based Macs, the iMac and MacBook Pro, were announced, Steve Jobs remarked that the new naming schemes for their products reflected their desire to have \"Mac\" in the name of all of their computers, and because they were \"done with power.\" This was in reference to the fact that the previous PowerPC G5 processors were not energy efficient, and therefore used far too much power to be used in any portable Macs.\n\nThe first known attempt to move to Intel platforms was the Star Trek project from spring 1992 to 1993, a joint effort with Novell to port Mac OS 7 to run on ordinary 486 PCs. It was based on Novell's next in-development version of DR DOS with its pre-emptive multitasker, which provided a hybrid 32-bit/16-bit core system similar in architecture to Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. The ported System 7.1 ran on top of this environment. While the project was successful with running pre-beta versions it was stopped in 1993 after management and strategy changes. The core system (but without the Star Trek-specific components) was later released as part of Novell DOS 7.\n\nThe Macintosh line underwent a similar transition between 1994 and about 1996, when Apple switched from Motorola's 68k series of chips to IBM/Motorola PowerPC processors, developed jointly by Motorola, Apple, and IBM. This took several years, during which Apple produced versions of the classic Mac OS that could run on either platform, introduced fairly low-level emulation of the 68k architecture by the PowerPC models, and encouraged third-party developers to release fat binaries that could run natively on either architecture.\n\nApple later transitioned the Macintosh from the earlier classic Mac OS to Mac OS X. This transition also took a number of years, and was facilitated by the inclusion of Classic, an environment in which an instance of Mac OS 9 could be run, permitting the execution of programs that had not been ported to Mac OS X, as well as the introduction of Carbon for Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, allowing programs to run natively on either system.\n\nJobs revealed at the 2005 WWDC that every version of Mac OS X had been secretly developed and compiled for Intel processors (as well as PowerPC) as they were developed; the portability of its predecessor NeXTSTEP had been maintained. It is not publicly known whether Apple maintains current builds for any other architectures although the related iOS runs on the iPhone's ARM architecture.\n\nSteve Jobs stated that Apple's primary motivation for the transition was their disappointment with the progress of IBM's development of PowerPC technology, and their greater faith in Intel to meet Apple's needs. In particular, he cited the performance per watt projections in the roadmap provided by Intel. This is an especially important consideration in laptop design, which affects the hours of use per battery charge.\n\nIn June 2003, Jobs had introduced Macs based on the PowerPC G5 processor and promised that within a year, the clock speed of the part would be up to 3 GHz. Two years later, 3 GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the POWER4-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a laptop computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the personal computer industry.\n\nSome observers were surprised that Apple had not made a deal with AMD, which had in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel. AMD had recently released its competitive 64-bit Opteron platform, and by moving straight to x86-64 Apple would have had one less architecture transition. Analysts have speculated that AMD's lack of low-power designs at the time were behind the decision to go with Intel. However, in 2011, Apple investigated using AMD’s low power Llano APU for the MacBook Air, but eventually opted for Intel due to AMD's potential inability to supply enough Llano processors to meet demand.\n\nAdvocates of the transition pointed out the potential for the new Intel Mac systems to run four classes of software at native speeds: Mac OS X binaries, Java/.NET applications, Unix applications, and Win32/x86 applications.\n\nOriginally, emulation software such as DOSBox or Microsoft Virtual PC was required to run x86 software on the Macintosh. Such software could now enjoy much more success with near-native performance through virtualization, such as is currently being done by Parallels Desktop for Mac and VMware Fusion. For those customers wishing to achieve a more conventional environment, a dual boot solution is possible on an x86 Apple device using Boot Camp software (which includes Windows drivers for Mac hardware). Some third-party partitioning options can even provide triple, or even quadruple boot.\n\nAlthough most games depend on the use of DirectX APIs not available on Mac OS X (on either processor type), it should be easier to port OS-independent code, such as OpenGL, now that developers no longer have to resolve endian, and other ISA dependency issues associated with moving from x86 to PowerPC.\n\nThe announcement of Apple's intention to switch to Intel-based Macs caused concern because Rosetta, the PowerPC dynamic translator, when first announced, emulated a G3 at only 60–80% of a similarly powered CPU's clock speed. Apart from this, Classic, the Mac OS 9 virtualization for Mac OS X, was not ported to the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator.\n\nThe performance of Intel's chipsets was a concern, along with the x86 architecture itself, and whether it would affect system performance and application quality. Other problems include endianness and reduced floating point performance in real world applications relative to equivalent or contemporary PowerPC processors.\n\nIt was also feared that it may be possible for Windows and Windows applications to run natively on Mac hardware, possibly killing off Mac OS X and/or applications developed for it. There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an Osborne effect, and there was the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the Intel Inside branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would take time and money to convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.\n\nThere were also fears that Intel, which took part in the development and implementation of the USB, would force Apple to drop all development and support of its FireWire serial bus on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as FireWire ports continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the MacBook Air in 2008, until being replaced by the faster Thunderbolt port.\n\nMany of these fears were put to rest at Macworld 2006 with the arrival of the first Intel-based Macs. Rosetta was improved to offer much faster speeds than originally demonstrated (though benchmarks suggest that PowerPC code still does not perform as well under emulation on a Core Duo iMac as it does on a G5 iMac). Intel's Core Duo CPUs perform nearly as well as the most powerful Power Mac G5 towers.\n\nApplications native to both PPC and Intel-based Macs such as Safari web browser were found to perform better on the Intel-based Mac than on the PPC-based Mac. However, classic Mac OS applications will not run directly on Intel Macs. Pre-Mac OS X applications can only be run on Intel Macs by using emulators such as vMac, Basilisk II, and SheepShaver, though the lack of stability of these emulators severely limits their functionality.\n\nFears of an Osborne effect were dismissed after sales of Macs for the Christmas 2005 quarter saw an increase over the previous Christmas. Unlike Windows-based PC counterparts \"Intel Inside\" stickers have never been included on any Apple product.\n\nThere were questions over the extent to which Apple would retain control over the non-processor components of the system design. Apple is traditionally a systems builder, and some feared that Apple's industrial design philosophy may be affected if the company switched to commodity parts. Others noted that Apple has slowly been switching to standard parts since the introduction of the PCI Power Mac in 1995, and said that using a non-Apple chipset in itself would not harm the Mac's image.\n\nIntel Macs employ a different Intel technology for firmware, Extensible Firmware Interface, not the Open Firmware Apple had been using. EFI removes the traditional PC reliance on the BIOS while providing more functionality.\n\nThe use of the x86 architecture allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, and opens the possibility of using the Wine package to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a dual-boot setup or a Wine variant (such as CrossOver Mac or Darwine) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to switchers, since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. The OSx86 Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the Extensible Firmware Interface, it would not be run on Intel-based Macs. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that Windows Vista will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.\n\nIntel was seen among the Mac community as a purveyor of hot-running chips (especially the Pentium 4). Apple themselves mocked the Pentium range in their \"Toasted Bunnies\" advertisements of the late 1990s. However, the Pentium M chips, which were designed for laptop use, run much cooler than the Pentium 4. Apple claimed the then-new Intel Core chips, which are based on the Pentium M microarchitecture, would have dramatically better performance per watt than the PowerPC G4 and G5.\n\nFinally, the relative quality of the x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of hardware registers compared to the PowerPC, and the lack of AltiVec (also known as Velocity Engine). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined RISC and CISC philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They also point out that improved SSE could equal AltiVec, and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the compiler does the work.\n\nThe PowerPC G5 was a 64-bit design, although very few applications made use of the increased address space. In contrast the original Core Solo and Core Duo chips were 32-bit. On August 7, 2006, Apple released the Mac Pro and Intel-based Xserve, introducing Intel 64 (Intel's implementation of x86-64) architecture into the lineup through the use of the Xeon processor. By August 7, 2007, all other computers in Apple's product line had been updated with the 64-bit Core 2 Duo; all subsequent Macs have had 64-bit processors.\n\nWhile the current benchmarks comparing Core Duo to Core 2 Duo processors show very little difference when running in 32 bit, the 64 bit edge has become more of an issue with the release of Mac OS X v10.6 (Snow Leopard), and now users can dual boot Windows 7 in full 64-bit mode.\n\nJava applications (that do not rely on Java Native Interface), some Dashboard Widgets, and scripts that execute inside an interpreter all work immediately on both processors and are immune to changes.\n\nIn Mac OS X 10.4 to Mac OS X 10.6, PowerPC applications that cannot be migrated ran inside a PowerPC dynamic translator on Intel called \"Rosetta.\" Rosetta is an instruction translator comparable to the 68k emulator that allows PowerPC Macintoshes to run pre-PowerPC code, rather than a virtual system like Classic; it does not require a second operating system to be loaded as a subsystem before the application can work. It was originally limited to a G3 instruction set, but later supported AltiVec and the G4 instruction set, leaving only the G5 additions unsupported. Rosetta was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7 and is no longer available.\n\nAltiVec itself has been encapsulated since Mac OS 10.3 by a vectorization library; this library uses AltiVec on the PowerPC and SSE (or equivalent regular instructions) on x86.\n\nA new version of Xcode was released that supported the generation of Universal Binaries for Intel and PowerPC, the new system's equivalent of the earlier 68k-PowerPC fat binaries. Cocoa applications can be ported simply by recompiling them and checking for endianness problems. Carbon applications required some additional tuning, but not of the complexity of the transition from Mac OS 9. Applications written using Metrowerks CodeWarrior suite had to be modified; those that use PowerPlant required further code changes, described by Apple and Metrowerks.\n\nClassic is not supported on the x86 architecture. This means that pre-Mac OS X software does not run on Mac OS X out of the box, to which some users running older applications (such as QuarkXPress 4 and 5) objected. However, third-party emulators, such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II, and SheepShaver, have been ported to Intel-based Macs, allowing some pre-Mac OS X software to run.\n\n"}

The game is so-called because the reserve resembles the weaves of a carpet or an arrangement of a quilt, with cards alternating vertical and horizontal rotations. The arrangement of the cards on the reserve is also the reason it is rarely seen on computer solitaire packages, most of which have their cards placed vertically.\n\nFirst, one Ace and one King of each suit are taken out to form the foundations. The rest of the cards are shuffled, and 64 cards are dealt into eight rows of eight cards each. The first row should have its first card placed vertically, the second placed horizontally, the third vertically, the fourth horizontally, and so on. The second row should have its first card placed horizontally, its second one vertically and so on. The resulting layout resembles a checkerboard with vertical and horizontal cards alternating. This reserve is called the \"quilt.\"\n\nThe cards on the quilt with their shorter sides exposed, i.e. cards each with one of its shorter sides not touching another card, are available for play to the foundations or the top of the wastepile. The foundations that start with the Aces are built up by suit while those that start with the Kings are built down also by suit.\n\nThe stock is dealt one at a time onto the wastepile. The top card of the wastepile can be used to build on the foundations and be built up or down by suit using cards from the quilt. \n\nOnce the stock runs out, the wastepile (which includes cards acquired from the quilt) is gathered and turned faced down without shuffling to be used as the new stock. This can be done only once in the entire game.\n\nThe game is won when all cards, both from the quilt and the wastepile, end up in the foundations.\n\n"}

It is native to Europe and was introduced to North America in the 1860s as an ornamental plant.\n\nNatural habitat types include dunes, pannes, coastal headlands and grasslands. In North America it is commonly found in the dry, gravelly soil of roadsides, pastures, and meadows. Cypress spurge thrives in open, disturbed areas.\nThe plant ranges from 8 inches (20 cm) to 16 inches (40 cm) in height. Its petal-like bracts are usually green-yellow, maturing to purple or red from May to August. The mature fruit explodes, spreading seeds up to . The plant also reproduces through lateral root buds, which allow it to spread densely. It can be identified by its leaves, which are small and linear, measuring up to long by only wide.\n\nThis plant is considered a noxious weed in many places, including Colorado in the United States. Like some other non-native plants, it invades the habitat of native species. It is known to be harmful to cattle and horses, but not sheep. It can be difficult to control. Biological pest control methods have been attempted, involving the release of several European insect species in North America. Certain flea beetles have been effective, but there are concerns about the release of non-native insects into the region.\n\nParasites of this species include \"Uromyces pisi-sativi\", a fungus.\n\n\"Anthrenus scrophulariae\" may frequently be found on this plant.\nThis plant is attractive as an ornamental but its invasive nature makes it necessary to control its spread; its root spread is more invasive than it's ability to self-seed.\n\nWhile the roots have sometimes been used as a purgative, it can be poisonous if taken in quantity, and animals can be poisoned by eating hay containing it. Contact with the sap can cause skin reactions.\nWARNING: This plant has several irritants. The milky sap is a skin irritant that can cause burns/blisters in some individuals. Late season mature bracts have tiny hair like barbs. Once they are in your skin can cause mild irritation that can last for years. If you work with this plant use gloves and long sleeves. When you work this plant do not touch your skin with gloves on.\n\n3) Morgan, PL Home Gardener, Adk. Mtns, NYS"}

The legislation establishes a statutory requirement for redistribution of electoral districts after every decennial Canadian census.\n\nThe redistribution process set out in the legislation took approximately six months to complete, and was overseen by an independent commission. The bill introduced by the government would have required that 55 ridings be maintained with populations varying between 75% and 110% of 1/55 of the provincial population. The Opposition Liberals expressed a desire for the commission to have greater flexibility either in the variance of the average population or in the number of districts. On June 30, 2005, an agreement was reached and the bill was amended to allow the commission to ignore population basis entirely in \"extraordinary circumstances,\" but should strive to be within the range of 90% to 110% of the average population of 55 districts.\n\nThere was considerable work to be done as 35 out of the 55 districts that existed from the outset were outside of the +/- 10% range. This is due in part to the population shifts over the course of a decade, and because the requirement was +/- 25% during the previous redistribution.\n\nIn the end, the commission was able to maintain most districts in their same alignment by means of minor boundary adjustments. However, two sets of districts were merged and there were considerable changes of district boundaries in the cities Dieppe and Fredericton.\n\n\n\n\nOn November 21, 2005, the Commission released its preliminary recommendations for new electoral districts. Despite the fact that the vast majority of existing ridings were outside of the +/- 10% population range, most were retained in the new distribution through minor adjustments to their boundaries. In all, 46 of 55 districts are largely unchanged. There are five essentially new districts, three of which resulting from a merger of previous districts or large parts of previous districts.\n\nOnly one district was created using the \"extraordinary circumstances\" clause of the legislation which allows districts to be less than 90% of the provincial average population. This was the district of Tantramar, which is an anglophone area surrounded by water, Nova Scotia and francophone areas. The Commission argued that the only way to maintain a community of interest was to leave the boundaries as they were. The districts of Nigadoo-Chaleur, Saint John Lancaster and Saint John Portland were the only others to have no changes whatsoever to their boundaries.\n\nThese proposals will be taken to the public in a series of hearings in January 2006, and may be subject to change before the commission tables its final report on February 18, 2006.\n\n\"† represents a proposal that was altered in the final report\"\n\nThough these districts were all largely unchanged from their previous form, some new names have been recommended due to subtle community changes as a result of minor boundary changes or for other reasons. These districts are denoted by an asterisk (*).\n\nThe commission released its final report on February 20, 2006. The commission altered the boundaries of 20 of the 55 districts from its proposals in its preliminary report, though many of the changes were minor. It also changed the proposed names of three districts whose boundaries remained the same as in the preliminary report.\n\nThere was some question as to whether or not these boundaries will be used in the next general election, there has been much media speculation that the government may fall by April 7, 2006 which would be just two days after the period for appeal of the commission's work will have ended. Government House Leader Bev Harrison has suggested that should the government fall then, it would be unlikely for the government to enact the regulation required to finalize the new boundaries so as to prevent confusion for voters and party officials. The Opposition House Leader, Kelly Lamrock, has suggested he would agree with such a move. However, Premier Bernard Lord went on to say that the boundaries would be used if at all possible as they are more equitable than the old boundaries. The election was not held, however, until September, and these boundaries were used.\n\n\n\n\nThe legislation governing the electoral district reform process allowed for appeals to the final report which were signed by two members of the legislature. The commission received 15 such appeals.\n\nAfter considering the appeals, the commission discarded most of them saying that the appeals did not provide further justification beyond those arguments that they had already rejected or that accepting the changes would cause a domino effect requiring a massive redrawing of the boundaries.\n\nThey did however accept three appeals:\n\n\nThe \"Electoral Boundaries and Representation Act\" forbade the Legislative Assembly from making any changes to the boundaries of electoral districts, but it did allow MLAs to change their names. On May 12, 2006, the Legislature decided to make several changes as follows:\n\n"}

The airport is owned and operated by Jefferson County and is situated midway between Denver and Boulder on U.S. Highway 36. It is located sixteen miles northwest of the central business district of Denver, and is the closest airport to downtown Denver. The airport covers and has three runways. Formerly known as Jefferson County Airport or Jeffco Airport, the airport was renamed Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on October 10, 2006 although it is sometimes referred to as Rocky Mountain Regional Airport, e.g. 2007-2012 county planning documents.\n\nThis airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a \"reliever airport\". It is home to a large general aviation population including a fair amount of corporate traffic and several flight schools. The airport's proximity to the nearby Interlocken business district contributes to its business traveler clientele. It has a control tower on 118.6 (Local) and 121.7 (Ground) that is open from 0600 to 2200 local time. ATIS/AWOS broadcasts on 126.25. There are three runways - 12/30 Left and Right and 3/21. The runway numbers were changed in November 2014 to reflect a change in magnetic variation. One fixed-base operator (FBO) offers fuel and other services. Two restaurants, E's Just Good Eats and Blue Sky Bistro, are on the field, along with a pilot's lounge in the Signature FBO and a passenger terminal lobby. The Hilltop Inn, a bed & breakfast, and its companion restaurant, The Burns Pub & Restaurant (\"authentic British pub fare\"), is located on the property.\n\nOn February 7, 2012 the Federal Aviation Administration dedicated a new $23.7 million, state-of-the-art airport traffic control tower, located south of the airport runways. The new facility includes a 124-foot-tall control tower topped by a 525-square-foot tower cab with four air traffic controller positions and one supervisor position. A 6,000 square-foot, single-story base building houses administrative offices, training rooms, and equipment rooms.\n\nRocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport covers an area of 1,700 acres (688 ha) at an elevation of 5,673 feet (1,729 m) above mean sea level. It has three asphalt paved runways: 12L/30R is 9,000 by 100 feet (2,743 x 30 m); 12R/30L is 7,002 by 75 feet (2,134 x 23 m); 3/21 is 3,600 by 75 feet (1,097 x 23 m).\n\nThe airport's three runways, previously 11L/29R, 11R/29L, and 2/20, were renumbered in November 2014 in order to align them with magnetic directions. At the same time, the primary runway (12L/30R) underwent an $8.83 million renovation.\n\nFor the 12-month period ending September 30, 2018, the airport had 175,759 aircraft operations, an average of 482 per day: 92% general aviation, 4% air taxi, 3% military and <1% air carrier. At that time there were 360 aircraft based at this airport: 70% single-engine, 17% multi-engine, 9% jet, and 4% helicopter.\n\nCurrently, two Fixed Based Operators (FBO)s operate at the airport: Signature Flight Support and Sheltair. The United States Forest Service also maintains its Jefferson County Tanker Base at the airport, and on July 13, 2016, Pilatus Aircraft broke ground on a new 188,000 sq. ft. North American completion center for the new PC-24 business jet. The facility became fully operational in June 2018.\n\nThe airport currently has no scheduled airline flights. The airport was formerly a hub for Pet Airways before ceasing all flights in early 2013. Denver Air Connection operated by Key Lime Air also operated from RMMA to Grand Junction before consolidating their operations for the Denver-Grand Junction route to Centennial Airport in May 2017.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Pilatus Aircraft officially launched operations out of their newly constructed hangar located on the southwest corner of the airfield. \n\nIn the spring of 2018, the airport signed a lease agreement with a second FBO, SheltAir, to act as their \"gateway to the west\". SheltAir commenced operations in February 2019 with a temporary modular building located at the East Ramp area. Construction for the permanent building and hangar is expected to commence Spring 2019. \n\nThere exists a vacant tract of airport-owned land just southwest of the runways. Currently, the airport is in the planning stages to develop this area, known as \"The Verve\", for various aviation and non-aviation related uses. \n\n\n"}

The film has many cameo appearances made by various filmmakers and directors, including Landis himself. The soundtrack features the songs \"Into the Night\", \"In the Midnight Hour\" and \"Lucille\", performed by B.B. King.\n\nUpon discovering that his wife is having an affair, aerospace engineer and depressed insomniac Ed Okin drives to LAX on his friend Herb's suggestion. There, he is surprised by a beautiful jewel smuggler, Diana, who jumps into his car and begs him to drive her away from four Iranians who are chasing her. She persuades him to drive her to various locations, and he becomes embroiled in her predicament. After becoming increasingly exasperated with her demands, he discovers that Diana has smuggled priceless emeralds from the Shah of Iran's treasury into the country, and is being pursued by various assorted assailants, including the aforementioned agents of a criminal Iranian expatriate and a British hitman.\n\nThe couple's caper gets increasingly out of hand, until Diana is eventually taken hostage by the thugs at the airport; here, Ed shares his ennui with the man holding a gun to Diana's head. The man shoots himself, instead. Taken to a motel room by federal agents, they are given a fortune in cash from one of Diana's wealthy friends via a federal agent. Diana showers and Ed finally sleeps. He wakes up after a full night's rest to an empty hotel room, with most of the money gone. However, when he leaves the room, Diana is waiting for him, with the money, a smile, and a request for a ride to the airport.\n\n\nJohn Landis appears in the film as the mute member of the quartet of Iranian henchmen, alongside:\n\nThe film was greenlit by Sean Daniel, president of Universal; he was the executive who had championed Landis on \"National Lampoon's Animal House\". Three weeks into the 60-day shoot, Landis was ordered to stand trial for involuntary manslaughter arising out of the \"Twilight Zone\" shoot. Daniel told the press he thought Landis and his colleagues had been \"unfairly sent to trial for what is obviously a human catastrophe, not a criminal act.\"\n\n\"Into The Night\" has a rating of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 critics' reviews, indicating a negative critical reception. Vincent Canby in the \"New York Times\" wrote: \"A little bit of \"Into The Night\" is funny, a lot of it is grotesque and all of it has the insidey manner of a movie made not for the rest of us, but for moviemakers on the Bel Air circuit who watch each other's films in their own screening rooms.\" He reserved praise, however, for the performances of the two leading actors: \"Mr. Goldblum does little except react to the outrages of others, which he manages with a good deal of comic poise. Miss Pfeiffer, last seen as Al Pacino's cocaine-zonked wife in \"Scarface\", is so beautiful that one is apt not to notice that she has the potential for being a fine comedienne.\" \"Variety\" held a similar view, writing that the \"film itself tries sometimes too hard for laughs and at other times strains for shock,\" while also praising the performance of Jeff Goldblum, \"nonetheless enjoyable as he constantly tries to figure out just what he's doing in all of this.\"\n\nSome critics saw the large number of cameo appearances by Landis's friends and colleagues as unnecessary and distracting. Roger Ebert in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote: \"If I had been the agent for one of the stars, like Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Richard Farnsworth, or Kathryn Harrold, I think I would have protested to the front office that Landis was engaging in cinematic autoeroticism and that my clients were getting lost in the middle of the family reunion.\" \"Time Out\" wrote: \"The casting of innumerable major film-makers in small roles seems an unnecessary bit of elbow-jogging, but David Bowie makes an excellent contribution as an English hit man, and the two leading players are excellent: Pfeiffer in particular takes the sort of glamorous yet preposterous part that generally defeats even the best actress and somehow contrives to make it credible every inch of the way.\"\n\nDespite negative reviews, John Landis is very pleased with the movie: \"\"Into the Night\" was my first box-office failure, and that was quite surprising to me, because I hadn’t done anything different. It was dark. And that’s another thing; critics don’t like it when you fuck with genre. It’s the opposite of high concept. High concept is when you can explain [the movie] in one sentence, but when things get muddled, they’re confused. I like\" Into the Night\".; It’s got a wonderful cast.\"\n\n\"Into The Night\" won the Special Jury Prize at the 1985 Festival du Film Policier de Cognac.\n\nThe score for \"Into the Night\" was written by Ira Newborn (tracks \"Enter Shaheen\" and \"Century City Chase\"). Newborn also composed two new songs for the film soundtrack, \"Into the Night\" and \"My Lucille\" (both performed by blues singer B.B. King) and also arranged the classic song \"In the Midnight Hour\".

Takakuni supported Hosokawa Sumimoto and got credit for putting down Sumiyuki. Because of that, he participated in the Muromachi shogunate in depth. In 1508, when Ōuchi Yoshioki marched his armies into Kyoto with Ashikaga Yoshiki (Ashikaga Yoshitane), the former \"shōgun\" who had escaped to Suō Province, Takakuni conspired with them and purged the shogun Ashikaga Yoshizumi and Sumimoto to Ōmi Province. \n\nTakakuni and Yoshioki took hold of the Muromachi shogunate. Takakuni took over as head of the Hosokawa people and took the blam of Kanrei. In addition, he also held the post of Shugo of Settsu Province, Tanba Province, Sanuki Province and Tosa Province. In 1518, he monopolized the powers of the shogunate after Yoshioki went back to his domain. In 1521, Yoshiki hated to be a puppet shogun, and escaped to Awa Province.

He was Atlanta's quintessential railroad man as well as a major landowner and civic leader. In railroads he served as a laborer, chief engineer, speculator and executive all over the South. As part of his speculation, he owned enormous tracts of land in strategic areas. For example, at one point he owned more than in what is now Atlanta. He designed and built Atlanta's defenses during the American Civil War and afterwards became an important civic leader: donating the land for Grant Park, Atlanta's first large park, and serving as councilman and on various boards and committees. His mansion is one of only four remaining original antebellum houses in the city of Atlanta.\n\nLemuel Pratt Grant was born at Frankfort, Maine, on August 11, 1817. He grew up on a farm and between twelve and nineteen years of age worked on the farm and in a village store. When nineteen years old, he became a rodman in the Engineer Corps of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, then under construction. By study and hard work, he made his way and in one year became assistant engineer.\n\nIn 1840, he was given the position of assistant engineer of the Georgia Railroad, under John Edgar Thomson, the chief engineer. His part of engineers located the line between Madison and Atlanta in 1840. In 1841, he became assistant in the engineer corps of the Central Railroad, of which L.O. Reynolds was the chief engineer, but in 1843 returned to the Georgia Railroad and served it until the grading was completed to Marthasville.\n\nBy 1844 he was buying large tracts of Atlanta real estate, mainly in the Third Ward. Two of LP's grandsons Laurel and Bryan, Sr. were successful real estate brokers and developers.\n\nIn 1845, L.P. Grant became the chief engineer and superintendent of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad and remained with that road until 1848, when its track was laid as far as Opelika, Alabama. He then again returned to the services of the Georgia Railroad, this time as resident engineer, which position he held until 1853. for two years of that period he was also chief engineer of the Atlanta and West Point Railroad.\n\nFrom 1853 to 1858, he was engaged in railroad construction contracts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. In 1858, he was elected president of the Southern Pacific Company of Texas, and was succeeded by J. Edgar Thompson in 1859.\n\nIn 1859 and 1860, he was engaged as engineer of surveys and location of proposed roads in Alabama and Georgia but those were suspended on the approach of the [Civil] war.\n\nIn 1862, [C.S.A] Colonel Grant was appointed a captain of engineers for the Confederacy and retained that position to the end of the [Civil] War. His most important work was the construction of the defensive works around Atlanta and Augusta.\n\nFrom October, 1866 to 1881, Colonel Grant was in charge of the Atlanta and West Point Railroad as General Superintendent. For a time, he was President of the Georgia Western Road, later the Georgia Pacific, and now the Southern Railway's line [source written in 1934] from Atlanta to Birmingham.\n\nIn 1875, he was appointed receiver for the Georgia part of the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line with about 100 miles of track. In 1881, he became President of the Atlanta and West Point Railroad and two years later, President of the Western Railroad of Atlanta. Both positions he held until 1887.\n\nIn 1844 and 1846, when Atlanta was known as Marthasville, Colonel Grant bought land lots 52, 53, and 44, containing about six hundred acres. For one of those lots he is said to have paid a dollar and a half per acre. That land was later worth an immense sum.\n\nIn 1883, Colonel Grant gave the City [of Atlanta] a later purchase containing [over] 100 acres of beautiful land for park purposes. It is known as Grant Park, and the City [of Atlanta] has added to his original gift by the purchase of some adjoining land.\"\"\n\nColonel Grant was an early advocate of the Public School System and a member of the first Board of Education elected in 1869. He was also a charter member of the Young Men's Library and its first life member.\n\nFrom 1860, Colonel Grant was a member of Central Presbyterian Church and took an active part in its work.\n\nHe was married in December 1843, to Miss Laura Loomis Williams, a daughter of Ammi Williams. She died in 1879, leaving four children. In 1881, he married Mrs. Jane L. Crew of Atlanta. John Armstrong Grant, a railroad manager of Texas and early founding member of Grady Hospital, was the son of the first marriage.\"\"\n\nColonel L.P. Grant is of no relation to either of the persons named John T. Grant or John W. Grant, nor their descendants. It is but a happy coincidence that Bryan M. Grant, Sr, and John W. Grant, were both successful Atlanta real estate developers and were also contemporaneous colleagues to one another. Of further note, there is no printed reference about L.P. Grant ever coming to prominence by working as a laborer on the Georgia Railroad, working for the Fannin Company, or working for any companies based in Augusta Ga. There are many erroneous statements in railroad related articles about these relationships. One can only imagine that there being several prominent Grants, and not of the same family, that some confusion has persisted down through the years.\n\nThe cited reference \"\" of Walter Cooper's Official History of Fulton County was written by an appointment by the Georgia Grant Jury \"in Pursuance to Legislative Action\" and published in 1934. The History Commission of that time was composed of Ivan Allen, Chairman, Henry C. Peeples, Dr. Louie D. Newton, Miss Ella May Thornton, and Miss Alice Baxter.\n\nIn 1843 Grant invested in land in what is now southeast Atlanta, paying from $.75 to $2 an acre, and built his home in the center of his 600+ acres. He donated east and southeast of his mansion to the city for a park that would be open and available free of charge to residents of any race, creed or color. His family then developed the surrounding neighborhoods, as evidenced by street signs named after family and friends of the family (Bryan Street, Grant Street, Loomis Street, Broyles Street, etc.). Lake Abana, where the zoo food court now exists below the panda exhibit, would have been witness to a crowd of bathers of any race, racial segregation not descending upon Atlanta until a decade or two later. During this idyllic period of relative stability of racial tension, Grant opened a trolley line between downtown and the park.\n\nOn January 27, 1857, Grant founded the Atlanta Bank with John Mims, William Ezzard, Clark Howell, Sr., Jonathan Norcross, Richard Peters, Joseph Winship and N.L. Angier. They were warned of Chicagoan George Smith who was planning on flooding Midwest banks with Georgia currency so avoided that scandal but eventually went broke and their charter was revoked in 1856. Grant would try banking again in the 1870s.\n\nIn 1853, he and John T. Grant headed to New Orleans to work on the Cotton Belt Railroad (then the Jackson and Great Northern Railroad). In 1857, Fannin, Grant & Co [These possibly the Athens Ga Grants, JT and WD Grant, contractors. Neither are related to LP Grant.] as became contractors to the Southern Pacific Railroad to link Marshall, Texas, to the West Coast, and the next year Lemuel P. Grant was named president of Southern Pacific. Back in Atlanta in 1860, he and Richard Peters pushed a Georgia Western Railroad against Jonathan Norcross's Air Line.\n\n\"From 1853 to 1858, he was engaged in railroad construction contracts in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. In 1858, he was elected president of the Southern Pacific Company of Texas, and was succeeded by J. Edgar Thompson in 1859.\"\n\nBefore the American Civil War, Grant gave land on Jenkins Street for Atlanta's first black church, Bethel Church (now Big Bethel Baptist Church), and defended the church's right to the property after the war.\n\nThe beginning of the war saw Grant still in Louisiana. In February 1861, Fannin, Grant & Co sold out to the Southern Pacific, and Grant returned to Atlanta. After the Vicksburg Campaign, Confederate Chief of the Engineer Bureau Jeremy Gilmer contacted him to survey possible enemy crossings of the Chattahoochee River, and defensive works were begun in August, 1863. Grant explained that the fortification of Atlanta would be as difficult as that of Richmond, Virginia. Grant planned a series of 17 redoubts forming a circle over out from the center of town. It was bounded on the north on high ground (present location of the Fox Theatre), on the west by Ashby Street, on the south by McDonough Drive and on the east by Grant Park. Gilmer inspected the completed work in December 1863. Because of how the Battle of Atlanta unfolded, these fortifications were never really put to the test, the city's Mayor Calhoun capitulating to the siege after the railways to Macon were seized by Union forces and Confederate General John Bell Hood was forced to destroy his ammunition train after the Union victory at Jonesborough. \n\nThe most important shopping area in town was Broad Street and Market Street which were separated by the railroads. A wooden bridge had been built to span the distance; when it burned, Grant designed and built a new one which was completed in July 1865. He was superintendent of the Western & Atlantic and Atlanta & West Point Railroads. In June 1867, he was on the first committee to name streets in Atlanta with Winship and former mayor William Ezzard. In 1870, he was part of the committee to lure Oglethorpe University to Atlanta from Midway. In 1873, he organized the Bank of the State of Georgia. Throughout the 1870s he represented the Third Ward in council and served on the Atlanta Board of Education and in the 1880s he served as water commissioner [Correction: His son John A, served as water commissioner ]. In 1882 he donated roughly in Land Lot 43 for Grant Park, current home of the Cyclorama and ZooAtlanta, later named in his honor, and the deed was issued May 17, 1883.\n\nIn 1884, he chartered Westview Cemetery with former mayor James W. English where he was buried after his death in 1893, a highly respected founding father of Atlanta.\n\nGrant married Laura Loomis Williams, daughter of prominent DeKalb County businessman Ammi Williams, in 1843. They had four children: John Armstrong Grant, Myra B. Grant, Lemuel Pratt Grant, Jr., and Letitia \"Lettie\" H. Grant.\n\nHe is survived by several descendants who currently reside in the Atlanta area and elsewhere. Of note, Bryan M. \"Bitsy\" Grant, Jr. is his great grandson, and achieved many remarkable feats as a world-renowned tennis athlete, honored in several Halls of Fame, including the International Tennis Hall of Fame. The City of Atlanta recognized him during the 1950s by naming a premier tennis center in his honor on Northside Parkway, Bitsy Grant Tennis Center.\n\nThe 1856 Lemuel P. Grant Mansion is one of only three antebellum houses within the current city limits of Atlanta that are still standing in their original locations, and is by far the closest to the city limits in the 1860s. The mansion was owned by Lemuel P. Grant, Atlanta's quintessential railroad man as well as a major landowner and civic leaderafter. Grant donated the land for Grant Park, which was named for him.\n\nThe three-story mansion was built in Italianate style in 1856. Union troops burning Atlanta in 1864 spared it because Masonic paraphernalia was found there, and the troops had been instructed not to harm the homes of Masons. In December 2001, the Atlanta Preservation Center purchased the house for $109,000; restoration of, and improvements to the house and grounds are ongoing.\n\nBobby Jones, the legendary golfer, was born in this home while the Jones family was in town visiting from Canton, GA.\n\nL.P. Grant's great grandson, Bryan M. \"Bitsy\" Grant, the famed tennis player named to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, grew up in this home until the family moved to Ansley Park along 17th Street. Bobby Jones, grandson, Bobby Jones IV is an Anglican priest in Athens Ga.\n\nAt this time, Margaret Mitchell, author of \"Gone with the Wind\" and niece to Cone Maddox, Sr., director of the Atlanta Cotton Exchange, purchased the home, and then met her untimely death being run down by a taxi in Peachtree Street. The home fell into the possession of caretakers who obtained squatting rights during the settlement of Mitchell's estate. One of the two men destroyed the home by sleeping in bed with a lit cigarette.\n"}

It was released on February 11, 2003.\n\nIn December 2001 Townsend announced that, contrary to his earlier public statements, a new Strapping Young Lad album would be released in 2002. He emphasized that he was not \"forcing\" his product upon fans to generate record sales, arguing that his band—and its contract with Century—was never a lucrative endeavour. Instead, Townsend's motivation was the \"creative anger\" sparked by the September 11, 2001 attacks and further cultivated during their 2001 tour, although Townsend would later downplay this as a factor. For the first time, the album would be a product of collaborative writing; the band wrote \"about half\" of the material on the 2001 Foot in Mouth Tour, and the rest at home, starting January 2002. After playing a small number of festivals in 2002, Strapping Young Lad entered the studio in September of that year, to record their third album.\n\nInitial writing for the album reached as far back as 2000, when the track \"Idom\" was released on the soundtrack for \"Tekkōki Mikazuki\"; this is a demo containing pieces later used for \"Dire,\" \"Consequence,\" and \"Aftermath.\" The album's sound was somewhat of a departure from Strapping Young Lad's previous albums, \"Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing\" and \"City\". Devin Townsend's vocals contain much more singing than before but also a lot of death growls and screaming, and rather than the blinding extreme metal/industrial metal styled songs of \"Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing\" and \"City\", many of the songs were structured and produced in a manner more akin to traditional death metal. The overall tone is darker and more serious in nature and contains less overt tongue-in-cheek humour than other SYL releases. The raw production style in particular is different from other records Devin has produced; he would later on call the album \"murky\" and \"dreadful sounding\" and claimed that he \"phoned [it] in\". The slightly different sound on this album can in part be attributed to the fact that second guitarist Jed Simon plays the vast majority of rhythm guitars. This was due to Townsend's concurrent production and recording of \"Accelerated Evolution\" by The Devin Townsend Band, which was released only a few weeks later. In an interview with Enslain Magazine, drummer Gene Hoglan had this to say about the more raw sound on the album \" the next album came out in 2003 and that was the self-titled \"SYL\", that was a little more raw bare-bones record, we didn't want to repeat \"City\", because \"City\" was like sample-heavy, and totally, we were being called an industrial band and all that sort of bullshit, and by the time we did \"SYL\", we liked being a metal band, so it was just a pretty raw metal record, not over-the-top samples or keyboards, or even the vocals weren't layered, and so that brought us to 2004 when we started writing \"Alien\".\n\n\"Strapping Young Lad\" was released on February 11, 2003, and became the band's first charting album, entering \"Billboard\"'s Top Heatseekers at No. 97. The album received moderate critical success. Nate Smith from Rockzone.com called it a \"solid addition to the Townsend catalog\", but \"not an instant classic\". Xander Hoose from Chronicles of Chaos called it \"a good album\", but said that it is inferior to \"City\". Alec A. Head of \"Satan Stole My Teddybear\" wasn't impressed, writing, \"Sadly, the songwriting putters out into a flaccid, heartless, faux-epic quagmire of riffs that have no destination, vocals that lack the ferocity and pure, unadulterated anger and emotion that Townsend exhibited on \"City\", and an altogether forced, cold, and directionless sense of songwriting.\" \"Strapping Young Lad\" differed from \"Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing\" and \"City\" in that it was less industrial and more reminiscent of death metal; the humour pervading the previous two albums became more subdued.\n\n\nChris Valagao, Ani Kyd, Tammy Theis, Marnie Mains, Carla Levis, and Laurielynn Bridger.\n\nGlenn Thomson, Denton Booth, Charlie Goler, Juanita English, Jeremy Glen, Blackie LeBlanc, Henry Goler, Jay Mosdell, Samanta Palomino, Eden Wagonner, Christ Stanley, Scarlet Stanley, Stuart Carruthers, Sue Carruthers, Sean Carruthers, Denis, Stevie J., La Sparka, Rossy Living, Dev, Jed and Byron.\n\n"}

She was also co-founder and majority owner of Major League Baseball's New York Mets baseball franchise, and was the first woman to own a major-league team in North America without inheriting it.\n\nJoan Whitney was born in New York City, the daughter of Payne Whitney and Helen Julia Hay. Her brother was John Hay Whitney. She inherited a trust fund from her grandfather, William C. Whitney and on her father's death in 1927, she received a large part of the family fortune. She attended Miss Chapin's School, then studied at Barnard College for a year, as well as taking some courses at Brown.\n\nJoan was a sports enthusiast who was a minority shareholder in the old New York Giants Major League Baseball club. She and her husband opposed moving the team to San Francisco in 1957. After the majority of the shareholders approved the move, Mrs. Payson sold her stock and began working to get a replacement team for New York City. Along with M. Donald Grant, the only other director who opposed the Giants' move, Payson put together a group that won a New York franchise in the Continental League, a proposed third major league. The National League responded by awarding an expansion team to Payson's group, which became the New York Mets.\n\nPayson served as the team's president from 1962–1975. Active in the affairs of the baseball club, she was much admired by the team's personnel and players. She was inducted posthumously into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1981. She was also the first woman to buy majority control of a team in a major North American sports league, rather than inheriting it.\n\nPayson was instrumental in the return of Willie Mays to New York City baseball in May 1972 by way of trade and cash from the Giants.\n\nJoan Whitney also inherited her father and grandfather's love of thoroughbred horse racing. Following her father's death, her mother took over management of his Greentree Stable, an equestrian estate and horse racing stable in Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Greentree breeding farm in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1932, her mother gave her a colt named Rose Cross whom she raced under the \"nom de course\", Manhasset Stable. Rose Cross won the 1934 Dwyer Stakes and finished a good fifth in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nIn partnership with her brother, Joan Whitney operated the highly successful Greentree stable, winning numerous important Graded stakes races including the Kentucky Derby twice, the Preakness Stakes once, and the Belmont Stakes four times.\nPayson and her husband owned an art-filled 50-room mansion at Greentree, the Whitney family estate in Manhasset, New York.\n\nAn avid art collector, she purchased a variety of artwork but favored Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works with her collection containing watercolors, drawings, and paintings. She owned numerous pieces including those by James McNeill Whistler, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Courbet, Maurice Prendergast, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Honoré Daumier, Joshua Reynolds, Claude Monet, Henri Rousseau, Jan Provost, Édouard Manet, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Alfred Sisley and Vincent Van Gogh. Payson was also a strong supporter of American artists, acquiring works by Thomas Eakins, Arthur B. Davies, Andrew Wyeth, Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent. Payson donated significant works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City where the \"Joan Whitney Payson Galleries\" can be found.\n\nThe Joan Whitney Payson Collection is on permanent loan to the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Maine and to Colby College in Waterville, Maine for one semester every two years. Regular educational tours of parts of the collection are offered to institutions throughout the United States.\n\nIn 1924, she married Charles Shipman Payson, a lawyer and businessman who was a native of Maine and a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School. Together they had five children:\n\n\nJoan Whitney Payson died in New York City, aged 72, after the 1975 baseball season. She is buried in the Pine Grove Cemetery, in Falmouth, Maine. Following her death, her daughter, Lorinda de Roulet, assumed the title of president of the Mets.\n\nHer heirs sold their stock in the New York Mets in January 1980 as well as Greentree Farm. In 2005, the equestrian property in Saratoga Springs was put up for sale with an asking price of $19 million. In 1991, her son, John Whitney Payson, permanently installed the Joan Whitney Payson Collection in the Portland Museum of Art in Portland, Maine where the Charles Shipman Payson Building cornerstones the Museum and is home to seventeen paintings by Winslow Homer he donated.\n\nBesides the Greentree estate in Manhasset, the family lived in an Italian Renaissance-palazzo style mansion in Manhattan. It was a wedding present from Joan's great uncle, Oliver Payne, her father's namesake, and designed by Stanford White. Located at 972 Fifth Avenue, it housed not just the family but 13 servants.\n\nHer husband was a Board member of Pepperdine University and together they provided the funds to build the university's library that was named for them. In 1943, she established and endowed the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation (named in honor of her mother) for medical research.\n"}

It is within the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City complex, near the Mexico City International Airport and in front of the Foro Sol, in which sports and artistic events are also celebrated. It is operated by Grupo CIE. Opened in 1968, the arena seats 20,000 and the overall capacity is approximately 26,000.\n\nThe Sports Palace—located from the Olympic Village and 6.5 from downtown Mexico City in the Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City near the conflux of two expressways (Miguel Alemán Viaduct and Río Churubusco Interior Loop)—was constructed specifically for the Olympic basketball competition.\nBuilt between October 15, 1966 and September, 1968, it is circular in design with a square-patterned dome spanning and enclosing an area of . The dome consists of hyperbolic paraboloids of tubular aluminum covered with waterproof copper-sheathed plywood and supported by huge steel arches. The Sports Palace seats 22,370—including 7,370 in removable seats. There is parking space for 3,864 vehicles.\n\nDesigned by architects Félix Candela, Enrique Castañeda Tamborel and Antonio Peyri, the structure has three floors, which house complete facilities for athletes, judges, officials, organizers, as well as services for radio, television and the press. A mezzanine provides access to the boxes and middle and upper stands. The Sports Palace was designed for a wide variety of programming: boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, fencing, etc., as well as for exhibitions, and tournaments that require more space, such as volleyball, basketball, ice hockey, cycling, athletic meets, equestrian shows, dances, circuses, conventions and expositions. There is a smaller pavilion for expositions and concerts.\n\nThe venue opened on 8 October 1968 with a performance by Maurice Béjart's Ballet of the 20th Century.\n\nIt hosted the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games for the competitions of basketball and can be used to host volleyball and basketball matches. It was the home of the CBA Mexico City Aztecas in 1994 and 1995, and the Mexico Toros of the CISL in 1995. On 6 December 1997 hosted the NBA's regular season game between the Houston Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks, which ended with a 108-106 score.\n\nAnother common use is to host big expositions and rock or pop concerts. These are the most representative and important shows, as there have been more than 400 concerts held here throughout the years.\n\n"}

{"id": "2020803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020803", "title": "Gobots", "text": "Gobots\n\nGoBots is a line of transforming robot toys produced by Tonka from 1983 to 1987, similar to Hasbro's Transformers. Although initially a separate and competing line of toys, Tonka's Gobots became the intellectual property of Hasbro after their buyout of Tonka in 1991. Subsequently, the universe depicted in the animated series \"Challenge of the GoBots\" and follow-up film \"\" was established as an alternate universe within the Transformers multiverse. While Hasbro now owns the fictional side of the property (character names, bios, storyline), the actual toys and their likenesses were only licensed from Bandai in the 1980s, were not covered by the Tonka acquisition, and are not available for Hasbro use.\n\nThe GoBot toyline was based on figures produced by Popy of Japan (the now-defunct character division of Bandai), named Machine Robo. In another similarity to Transformers, Tonka decided to make the figures sentient robots, rather than human-piloted mecha as they had been in Japan, and divided them into two factions – the good Guardians and evil Renegades (although early figures were simply described as ‘Friendly’ or ‘Enemy’ on the packaging). The figures were all given individual names, in contrast to the simple designations they received in Japan.\n\nIntroduced in 1983 by Tonka Inc., the GoBots toys were part of the robot \"sensation\" that swept the nation for a short time.\n\nThe line sold well initially, but was overtaken by Transformers. 1987 was the final year in which new Gobots were released. In 1991, Hasbro acquired the GoBots range from Tonka Inc.\n\nTonka released the first batch of figures to stores in 1983, one year prior to the Transformers. The bulk of the Gobot line was taken from the Machine Robo ‘600 Series’ line of figures, which were around 5–8 cm / 2-3 inches high on average. The robot figures transformed into a mixture of generic and specific contemporary machines, plus a handful of Second World War fighter aircraft, and a number of futuristic designs. This unnamed assortment, usually referred to as ‘Regular’ Gobots, was used throughout the four years Gobots were produced, and was later supplemented by figures from the Machine Robo Devil Invaders sub-line, plus some aborted Machine Robo figures and some commissioned from Bandai by Tonka.\n\nLarger figures, averaging around 12–15 cm (5-6 inches) tall in robot mode, were released as Super Gobots. Some of these were drawn from the Machine Robo Scale Robo DX line, some from the MR Big Machine Robo line (these included larger versions of Leader-1, the Guardian leader, and Cy-Kill, the Renegade leader) and some designs not released in Japan. The line also included two gestalt-style figures, the car-based Puzzler and monster-based Monsterous.\n\nSeveral other ranges were drawn from existing Bandai figures (such as the Secret Riders ).\n\nTonka did design some toys for the line, including the Guardian Command Center and Renegade Thruster playsets, and the motorized Renegade Zod. In addition to these, two versions of the Power Warrior were made for both the Guardians and the Renegades, using molds from the Machine Robo line and recolored. The Nemesis Power Warrior used a tank for the center body and was released only in Japan. A large playset called the Gobotron Fortress was also shown to have existed in various articles and catalogues, but it has never been released.\n\nA spin-off line, Rock Lords, crossed over with the Gobots in the feature film \"\", and were issued as a separate toyline by Tonka in 1986.\n\nHanna-Barbera produced a cartoon series called \"Challenge of the GoBots\" to promote the toyline, which ran for 65 22-minute episodes from 1984 to 1985. In 1986, soon after the end of the \"Challenge of the Gobots\" television series, the Gobots co-starred with the Rock Lords in an animated feature film \"\", again produced by Hanna-Barbera.\n\nIn 1984, two Gobot children's books were published by Golden Books, an imprint of Western Publishing. The books, titled \"War of the Gobots\" and \"Gobots on Earth\", were written by Robin Snyder and illustrated by Steve Ditko, and chronicled the origins of the Gobots. The Gobots were also featured in the 1986 book \"Collision Course Comet - Robo Machine Featuring The Challenge Of The Gobots\" and the 1985 book \"The Wagner Sirens-Robo Machine Featuring The Challenge Of The Gobots,\" both of which were published by Egmont Books.\n\nThe closest thing to a Gobot comic book was the \"Gobot Magazine\", produced by Telepictures Publishing. This included a short comic strip, based on the \"Challenge of the GoBots\" cartoon continuity, as well as features on real-life robots, quiz pages and the like. It ran quarterly from winter 1986 to winter 1987, managing five issues. Unlike the \"Transformers\" comics, it was aimed at a very young readership.\n\nIn the UK, a \"Robo Machines\" comic strip was produced, using many of the characters from the Gobot line, but following a different continuity than the cartoon. This was written by Tom Tully, and ran in the second volume of \"Eagle\" from November 1984 to July 1985. After Fleetway discontinued their licence agreement, the property was leased to World Distributors, who produced annuals following the cartoon continuity in 1986 and 1987.\n\nA Gobots video game was released in 1986 by Ariolasoft on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer formats. Gobots software for other computers, home video game systems or coin-operated arcade game systems is unknown at this time.\n\nIt was announced that Hasbro has applied for a new Go-Bots trademark (this is not a renewal) under \"distribution of motion pictures, ongoing television programs\" and \"Toys, games and playthings, namely, toy vehicles and accessories for use therewith.\n\nIn October 2018, IDW began publishing a \"Go-Bots\" mini series written and illustrated by Tom Scioli.\n\nUnlike Transformers, Gobots was released in several guises around the world.\n\nIn 1991, Hasbro took over Tonka, and thus the Gobot trademarks; the molds for the action figures remain the property of Bandai, having only been leased to Tonka, and some were reissued in 1993 for the European Robo Machines line. Since then, the trademarks have been used several times — a character called Gobots was released in 1993, a range of figures in 1995 were called the Go-Bots, and Hasbro subsidiary Playskool issued a line named in 2002. To this date there have been a few exclusives referencing GoBots, but they have all been recolors of other Transformer molds as opposed to new figures. Examples of this are the Transformers 2007 movie themed Fracture (based on Crasher) and Backtrack (based on Night Ranger; unreleased, but shown in promotional materials) and Revenge of the Fallen figures Deadlift (based on Spoons) and Reverb (based on Dart). Also Botcon 2007 Bugbite, an off-white repaint of Classics Bumblebee, was released as the second Bug Bite toy in Transformers. The first Bug Bite was a Japanese-exclusive white repaint of Generation 1 Bumblebee which retained Bug Bites VW Beetle vehicle mode. The color change to white was due to Bumblebee and Bug Bite sharing the colors yellow and black in their original competing releases.\n\nThe name Leader-1 was reused for Transformers Armada Megatron's mini-con in 2002.\n\nWhile Hasbro has used current toy technology to update their G1 Transformer characters over the years, it is unlikely that Gobots will receive similar treatment, as the molds—and thus, the original character designs—belong to Bandai.\n\nIn 1995, a line of Transformers called Go-Bots (small, Matchbox sized car Transformers which had racing axles) were released, including Bumblebee, Double Clutch, High Beam, Ironhide, Megatron, Mirage, Optimus Prime, Soundwave, Sideswipe, and Frenzy. Of the 6 molds produced, 15 Go-Bot characters were released (2 of the original 6 figures have tooling variations gang-molding and the addition of the Optimus and Megatron cars), including the 1995 BotCon convention exclusive figure, Nightracer (a recoloring of Go-Bot Bumblebee). Subsequent uses of these molds were renamed Spy Changers.\n\nGearhead was used to demonstrate the Hasbro Go-Bots line at Toy Fair 1995. They were described by the pitch-man as \"\"The all new, most mind-blowing, laser-slashing, robot-bashing product line ever!\"\" \n\n"}

Born in Woolton in Liverpool, England, he spent virtually his entire childhood growing up in Motherwell, Scotland. He is notable for being the first professional player to have played for England without having previously played in the English football league system, and for scoring over 100 goals in both the English and Scottish leagues. His brother Gerry Baker was also a professional footballer, who played internationally for the United States.\n\nJoe Baker's mother was Scottish. His father, born in Woolton, was a sailor and when living in New York, Joe's elder brother, Gerry, was born in 1938. After the outbreak of war the family moved to Liverpool where Joe was born in Woolton in 1940. Only six weeks after the birth the family moved back to Scotland where Baker spent the rest of his childhood.\n\nA centre forward, Baker spent a month on trial with Chelsea as a youngster, but was not signed. He signed professional terms with Hibernian after playing Junior football for local Coltness United, and was then farmed out to another Junior team, Armadale Thistle. In his first season with Hibs, the 17-year-old Baker scored all four goals in Hibs' 4–3 victory over city rivals Hearts in the quarter-final of the 1958 Scottish Cup. Baker played in the 1958 Scottish Cup Final, which Hibs lost 1–0 to Clyde. He also scored nine goals in a Scottish Cup tie against Peebles Rovers. Baker was Hibs' top goalscorer for four consecutive seasons, scoring a club record 42 goals in 33 league games during the 1959–60 season. In all he scored 102 goals in just 117 league games, and 159 goals in all competitions for the Edinburgh club\n\nGerry Baker signed for Hibernian from Manchester City not long after Joe had left the Edinburgh club.\n\nIn 1961, Baker was transferred to Torino for £75,000, after the Hibs board refused to give him a £5 wage increase from his existing wage of £12 a week. Despite scoring a winning goal in a Turin derby match against Juventus, his time at the Italian club was short and almost ended in tragedy. Baker was involved in a serious car crash, which meant that he needed life-saving surgery and spent over a month on a drip feed. It was a generally unhappy spell as Baker did not like the press intrusion, which meant that he and teammate Denis Law spent most of their time in their Turin apartment.\n\nBaker recovered from his injuries and he returned to the UK in July 1962, joining Billy Wright's Arsenal for a club record fee of £70,000. He made his debut against Leyton Orient on 18 August 1962, and in all spent four seasons with the Gunners. For three out of those four seasons (1962–63, 1964–65 and 1965–66) he was the club's top scorer; in total he scored 100 goals in 156 games in all competitions, making him one of the club's most prolific goalscorers of all time.\n\nHis pace and acceleration made him a highly effective and dynamic attacker, and he was equally adept with his feet and his head, despite his lack of height. With Geoff Strong he formed one of Arsenal's most prolific striking partnerships, but Arsenal's defence could not match the quality of their attack, which meant they were unable to finish above 7th in the league during his time at the club.\n\nAfter a disappointing 1965–66 season, Wright sold Baker to Nottingham Forest for £65,000. Baker had a successful 1966/67 at Forest, as the club finished runners-up in the top division to the following season's European Cup Winners, Matt Busby's Manchester United who included Baker's ex Torino teammate, Denis Law. \nIn that season, Joe Baker was injured in the 3-2 victory over Everton in the FA Cup 6th round and missed the rest of the season. Prior to his injury Forest had lost only once in 28 games. After his injury they only won 3 of their 6 remaining league games and lost in the FA Cup semi final to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nAfter three years at Forest, Baker scored 41 goals in 118 league games.\n\nHe then moved to Sunderland for a fee of £30,000. Baker spent the following two seasons playing at and away from Roker Park for the Black Cats.\n\nBaker returned to Hibernian for a second time in 1971 and scored 12 goals in 30 appearances. He moved to Raith Rovers in 1972. He retired in 1974, having in all scored 301 league goals in 507 games.\n\nBaker's talents meant that he was selected by the Scottish Schools team, but his birthplace made him only eligible to play for England under the rules of the time; \"I was the first Scottish League player to play for England and it was a hard thing to take because I was a Scot, as far as I was concerned.\"\n\nHe made his England debut against Northern Ireland in 1959, which made him the first professional player to be capped for England while playing for a club outside the English football league system. It also meant that he was the first player to play for England without having ever played for an English club.

He has also written for the \"Oakland Tribune\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", Yahoo! Sports, and \"The National Sports Daily\". He has extensively covered mixed martial arts since UFC 1 in 1993 and currently covers the sport for SB Nation. He has been called \"the most accomplished reporter in sports journalism\" by Frank Deford of \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nHe is also a frequent lecturer on many aspects of the business of MMA, professional wrestling, and boxing at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University.\n\nMeltzer was born in New York City, and lived in upstate New York until he was ten, before his family settled in San Jose, California. Meltzer earned a journalism degree from San Jose State University and started out as a sports writer for the \"Wichita Falls Times Record News\" and the \"Turlock Journal\". He demonstrated an interest in professional wrestling and a journalistic approach to it early in life. Meltzer wrote several wrestling-related publications that predate \"WON\", dating back to 1971. The most notable of these was the \"California Wrestling Report\", ca. 1973–1974, which reported on the still-extant National Wrestling Alliance territories operating out of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nThe beginnings of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" (\"WON\") date back to 1980, when Meltzer began an annual poll amongst those with whom he corresponded regarding professional wrestling. According to Meltzer, he was just a fan at first. A short time later, he began maintaining a tape-trading list, and would occasionally send match results and news updates along with tape updates. Meltzer stated that he wanted to keep his friends in college \"in the loop\" for his tape trading as well as the happenings in the business, as the mainstream wrestling magazines catered to a somewhat younger demographic.\n\nMeltzer popularized the star rating system (devised by Jim Cornette and his childhood friend Norm M. Dooley), which rates matches on a scale of zero to five stars (sometimes going to negative five stars in the case of very bad matches) in a similar manner to that used by many movie critics.\n\nMeltzer has also given ratings that have exceeded five-stars. The first match Meltzer has given a rating that was above five-stars was Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat from a March 18, 1989 World Championship Wrestling show, which received a six star rating. The highest he has ever rated a match was seven stars (*******), given to Kazuchika Okada and Kenny Omega for their match at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall in June 2018. \n\nWrestlers, such as Bret Hart, have written how proud they were when their performances were praised in the \"WON\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played college basketball for University of Iowa.\n\nDavis attended Davenport North High School in Davenport, Iowa. He was a four-year starter and the Davenport North team made the state tournament his junior and senior years but did not reach the championship.\nHis father is Tyree Davis and Mother is Linda Davis, he has a younger brother named Edward.\nDavis played one season at the University of Iowa before being selected by the Charlotte Hornets in the first round of the 1998 NBA Draft, as the 21st pick overall.\n\nDavis played two seasons with the Charlotte Hornets, and became known for his high energy play and exciting poster dunks. Although he only played limited minutes, mostly off the bench, his high-flying play got him an invitation to the 2000 Slam Dunk competition, where he scored an 88 out of a possible 100 points, losing to champion Vince Carter. He was traded to the Miami Heat in a massive nine-player trade on August 1, 2000.\n\nDavis injured his ankle and knee with the Heat and only played a total of seven games for them, and was eventually sent to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-team deal involving the Toronto Raptors a year later on October 26, 2001.\n\nDavis was re-signed to a six-year deal by the Cavaliers on August 21, 2002, but his time in Cleveland was marked by disputes with coach Paul Silas. He additionally received attention for stat padding in a home game against the Utah Jazz on March 16, 2003. With Cleveland leading 120–95 and less than a minute remaining, Davis was one rebound short of his first career triple double, and he deliberately tossed an inbound pass off his own rim and caught it in attempt to receive credit for a rebound, but shots taken at one's own basket do not count as official field goal attempts. Jazz guard DeShawn Stevenson shoved Davis in response as Davis proceeded upcourt with the ball. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said to reporters afterward, \"I would have fouled him too. I would have knocked him on his ass.\" The Cavaliers initially said they would not punish Davis, saying the embarrassment was enough. However, in the face of a national outcry, the Cavaliers fined him an undisclosed amount for unsportsmanlike conduct, and the play led to Davis being nicknamed \"Wrong Rim Ricky\" in Cleveland.\n\nOn December 15, 2003, Davis was traded along with Chris Mihm, Michael Stewart, and a second round draft pick to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Tony Battie, Eric Williams, and Kedrick Brown.\nWith the Celtics, the Davis played the position of shooting guard, as well as small forward on occasion. Boston was criticized for acquiring him via trade due to Davis's reputation of selfishness, but he became a more consistent player and a fan-favorite in the city.\n\nOn January 26, 2006, Davis was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves with Mark Blount, Marcus Banks, Justin Reed, and two second round draft picks for Wally Szczerbiak, Michael Olowokandi, Dwayne Jones and a first round draft pick.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, Davis was again traded to the Miami Heat along with teammate Mark Blount in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker, Michael Doleac, Wayne Simien and a first-round draft pick. Davis was reunited with Pat Riley, and Riley admitted he made a mistake of trading Davis in the first place; \"I made the mistake of trading him. He's a very talented kid. He was not a problem here. We just needed to move and get bigger players at that time. Over the last six years he has been very efficient.\"\n\nOn July 28, 2008, Davis signed a multi-year contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. He was waived by the Clippers on February 16, 2010 to make room for newly acquired guard Steve Blake and forward Travis Outlaw. He appeared in 36 games for the Clippers in the 2009/10 season.\n\nOn March 1, 2010, Davis signed a contract with the Turkish team Türk Telekom. It would be his first time playing outside the United States. He said about signing with Telekom: \"It will be my first European experience. I never watched matches. I just entered myself, and Turk Telekom B.K. signed me.\" \n\nIn October 2010, Davis signed a contract with the Jiangsu Dragons in China. In January 2011, Davis signed a contract with Chorale Roanne Basket in France.

There is no true boundary to define the village, and as such, there is great debate as to what constitutes residence. This is, however, purely theoretical as there is no legal, governmental or commercial status associated with residence. The debate has given rise to the common aphorism that, \"Adamant is a state of mind\".\n\nThe village was originally known as Sodom from its inception prior to the mid-19th century as a granite quarry-town.\n\nLocal lore tells the story of a preacher slamming his fist on the pulpit proclaiming, \"I am adamant that we change the name of this town!\" In 1905, residents petitioned the state legislature for a name change to \"Adamant.\"\n\nThe quarries remained an active part of the Vermont granite industry well into the mid-20th century.

It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in electrolytic baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride should not be confused with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl).\n\nSnCl has a lone pair of electrons, such that the molecule in the gas phase is bent. In the solid state, crystalline SnCl forms chains linked via chloride bridges as shown. The dihydrate is also three-coordinate, with one water coordinated on to the tin, and a second water coordinated to the first. The main part of the molecule stacks into double layers in the crystal lattice, with the \"second\" water sandwiched between the layers. \n\nTin(II) chloride can dissolve in less than its own mass of water without apparent decomposition, but as the solution is diluted, hydrolysis occurs to form an insoluble basic salt:\n\nTherefore, if clear solutions of tin(II) chloride are to be used, it must be dissolved in hydrochloric acid (typically of the same or greater molarity as the stannous chloride) to maintain the equilibrium towards the left-hand side (using Le Chatelier's principle). Solutions of SnCl are also unstable towards oxidation by the air:\n\nThis can be prevented by storing the solution over lumps of tin metal.\n\nThere are many such cases where tin(II) chloride acts as a reducing agent, reducing silver and gold salts to the metal, and iron(III) salts to iron(II), for example:\n\nIt also reduces copper(II) to copper(I).\n\nSolutions of tin(II) chloride can also serve simply as a source of Sn ions, which can form other tin(II) compounds via precipitation reactions. For example, reaction with sodium sulfide produces the brown/black tin(II) sulfide:\n\nIf alkali is added to a solution of SnCl, a white precipitate of hydrated tin(II) oxide forms initially; this then dissolves in excess base to form a stannite salt such as sodium stannite:\n\nAnhydrous SnCl can be used to make a variety of interesting tin(II) compounds in non-aqueous solvents. For example, the lithium salt of 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol reacts with SnCl in THF to give the yellow linear two-coordinate compound Sn(OAr) (Ar = aryl).\n\nTin(II) chloride also behaves as a Lewis acid, forming complexes with ligands such as chloride ion, for example:\n\nMost of these complexes are pyramidal, and since complexes such as SnCl have a full octet, there is little tendency to add more than one ligand. The lone pair of electrons in such complexes is available for bonding, however, and therefore the complex itself can act as a Lewis base or ligand. This seen in the ferrocene-related product of the following reaction :\n\nSnCl can be used to make a variety of such compounds containing metal-metal bonds. For example, the reaction with dicobalt octacarbonyl:\n\nAnhydrous SnCl is prepared by the action of dry hydrogen chloride gas on tin metal. The dihydrate is made by a similar reaction, using hydrochloric acid:\n\nThe water then carefully evaporated from the acidic solution to produce crystals of SnCl·2HO. This dihydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous using acetic anhydride.\n\nA solution of tin(II) chloride containing a little hydrochloric acid is used for the tin-plating of steel, in order to make tin cans. An electric potential is applied, and tin metal is formed at the cathode via electrolysis.\n\nTin(II) chloride is used as a mordant in textile dyeing because it gives brighter colours with some dyes e.g. cochineal. This mordant has also been used alone to increase the weight of silk.\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of tooth paste brands has been adding Tin(II) chloride as protection against enamel erosion to their formula , e. g. Oral-B or Elmex. \n\nIt is used as a catalyst in the production of the plastic polylactic acid (PLA).\n\nIt also finds a use as a catalyst between acetone and hydrogen peroxide to form the tetrameric form of acetone peroxide.\n\nTin(II) chloride also finds wide use as a reducing agent. This is seen in its use for silvering mirrors, where silver metal is deposited on the glass:\n\nA related reduction was traditionally used as an analytical test for (aq). For example, if SnCl is added dropwise into a solution of mercury(II) chloride, a white precipitate of mercury(I) chloride is first formed; as more SnCl is added this turns black as metallic mercury is formed. Stannous chloride can be used to test for the presence of gold compounds. SnCl turns bright purple in the presence of gold (see \"Purple of Cassius\").\n\nWhen mercury is analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy, a cold vapor method must be used, and tin (II) chloride is typically used as the reductant.\n\nIn organic chemistry, SnCl is mainly used in the Stephen reduction, whereby a nitrile is reduced (via an imidoyl chloride salt) to an imine which is easily hydrolysed to an aldehyde.\n\nThe reaction usually works best with aromatic nitriles Aryl-CN. A related reaction (called the Sonn-Müller method) starts with an amide, which is treated with PCl to form the imidoyl chloride salt.\n\nThe Stephen reduction is less used today, because it has been mostly superseded by diisobutylaluminium hydride reduction.\n\nAdditionally, SnCl is used to selectively reduce aromatic nitro groups to anilines.\n\nSnCl also reduces quinones to hydroquinones.\n\nStannous chloride is also added as a food additive with E number E512 to some canned and bottled foods, where it serves as a color-retention agent and antioxidant.\n\nSnCl is used in radionuclide angiography to reduce the radioactive agent technetium-99m-pertechnetate to assist in binding to blood cells.\n\nAqueous stannous chloride is used by many precious metals refining hobbyists and professionals as an indicator of gold and platinum group metals in solutions.\n\nMolten SnCl can be oxidised to form highly crystalline SnO nanostructures.\n\n"}
{"id": "2020857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020857", "title": "Winter Hill Gang", "text": "Winter Hill Gang\n\nThe Winter Hill Gang is a structured confederation of Boston, Massachusetts–area organized crime figures, who are predominantly of Irish and Italian descent. It derives its name from the Winter Hill neighborhood of Somerville, Massachusetts, north of Boston. Its members have included notorious Boston gangsters Buddy McLean, Whitey Bulger, Howie Winter, Joe McDonald, Johnny Martorano, Patrick Nee and Stephen Flemmi. They were most influential from 1965 under the rule of McLean and Winter until the takeover led by Bulger in 1979.\n\nThe Winter Hill Gang was given its name in the 1970s by journalists at the \"Boston Herald\", although the name was hardly ever openly used as a reference to them. While Winter Hill Gang members are alleged to have been involved with most typical organized-crime-related activities, they are perhaps most known for fixing horse races in the northeastern United States and shipping weapons to the IRA. Twenty-one members and associates, including Winter, were indicted by federal prosecutors in 1979.\n\nThe Boston Irish Gang War started in 1961 and lasted until 1967. It was fought between the McLaughlin Gang of the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, led by Bernie McLaughlin, and the Winter Hill Gang of Somerville, led by James \"Buddy\" McLean.\n\nThe two gangs had co-existed in relative peace for a number of years until an incident at Salisbury Beach on Labor Day weekend 1961. While at a party, Georgie McLaughlin made an advance on the girlfriend of Winter Hill Gang member Alexander Petricone, Jr. (who fled the Boston area during the war and became an actor under the name Alex Rocco). McLaughlin was subsequently beaten unconscious by members of the Winter Hill Gang and was dumped outside the local hospital. Bernie McLaughlin went to see \"Buddy\" McLean and demanded that he hand over the members of the gang who beat his brother. McLean refused. The McLaughlins took this refusal as an insult and attempted to wire a bomb to McLean's wife's car. In retaliation, McLean shot and killed McLaughlin coming out of the \"Morning Glory\" bar in Charlestown in October 1961. This was the start of Boston's Irish Gang War.\n\nIn 1965, McLean was shot and killed by one of the last survivors of the McLaughlin Gang, Steve Hughes. Howie Winter then assumed control of the Winter Hill Gang. One of the surviving McLaughlin brothers, nicknamed \"Punchy\", was shot while waiting for a bus in the West Roxbury section of Boston. A year later, in 1966, the last two associates of the McLaughlin Gang, brothers Connie and Steve Hughes were killed, allegedly by hitman Frank Salemme.\n\nAfter the Irish Gang war, the Winter Hill Gang was reputed to be not only the top Irish Mob syndicate in the New England area, but along the entire east coast as well. In the book \"Black Mass\" by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the authors make the unsubstantiated claim that the Winter Hill Gang were far more feared and powerful than their rivals, the Boston branch of the Patriarca crime family run by the Angiulo Brothers.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the gang's most prominent members were Howie Winter, John Martorano, James J. Bulger, Stephen Flemmi, Joseph McDonald and James Sims. The Winter Hill Gang was quite proficient at murdering rival mobsters in order to take over their rackets. But once they gained control, they had no idea how to run them. They learned the lesson of their gang's disastrous foray into gambling after wiping out Joseph (Indian Joe) Notranagelli's crew. In what should have been a fabulously profitable illicit gambling enterprise, the gang lost it. As the years went by, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi lost interest in running any kind of gambling operation. They would eventually only provide protection for bookmakers, drug dealers and truck hijackers. By 1975, Howie Winter and John Martorano were going broke. Eventually they had to go to Patriarca family underboss Gennaro Angiulo to borrow money. To make the weekly payments, they began going into businesses with people they didn't know and couldn't trust. These activities included rigging horse races and drug trafficking.\n\nIt was the decision to involve outsiders with their business that led to their downfall. By 1979, Howie Winter and the rest of the Somerville crew were all sent to prison for fixing horse races, leaving Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi as the new leaders of the Winter Hill Gang. During the 1980s, Bulger's associates consisted of Kevin Weeks, Kevin O'Neil, Jim Mulvey and Patrick Nee. By 1991, even as James J. Bulger's criminal career was winding down, he remained the undisputed mob boss. His criminal associate Kevin Weeks was not considered a threat, and neither were Jim Mulvey, even though he suspected Bulger of being an FBI informant, Billy Shea, John Shea, Tim Connolly, Pat Linskey, Eddie MacKenzie, Paul \"Polecat\" Moore or John Cherry. Boston journalist Howie Carr commented, \"They hadn't really been gangsters so much as they'd been ex-boxers and bar-room brawlers who had become cocaine dealers.\" One problem that arose with the gang was that they enjoyed partaking in their own vices. Like their customers, they spent afternoons in the fall drinking beer and watching professional football on television, often doubling up wagers on late West Coast games as they desperately tried to break even and chased their losses. Despite the above unsubstantiated claims of the gang's apparent inability to successfully run organised crime rackets, Bulger generated well over $25 million in racketeering proceeds alone throughout his criminal career, according to paperwork filed in federal court.\n\nIn 1998, during a trial for racketeering and fixing horse races, Steve Flemmi and Whitey Bulger were revealed under disclosure to be FBI informants. Steve Flemmi and Whitey Bulger were implicated in many unlawful activities, including murder, but were never brought to justice due to their FBI handlers diverting their guilt onto others in the gang or various other gangs of the time. They were first handled by Special Agent H. Paul Rico and then later by SA John \"Zip\" Connolly. In addition to providing details on other gangs, Flemmi and Bulger relayed information on fellow members of the Winter Hill Gang to the FBI. When they had nothing to report, they would make up information to ensure that they were seen to be of high value to the agency.\n\n\n\nJohn Connolly was an FBI agent who served as a handler for Bulger and Flemmi while they were informants. He leaked information about investigations targeting Bulger and Flemmi, which in several cases led to informants being murdered. He was convicted of racketeering in 2002 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was convicted of state charges of second-degree murder in Florida for the death of John Callahan in 2008 and sentenced to 40 years in prison.\n\n\n"}

The functional equivalent in the Macintosh operating system is called an alias, and a symbolic link (or symlink) in UNIX-like systems.\n\nFile shortcuts (also known as \"shell links\") were introduced in Windows 95. Microsoft Windows uses .lnk as the filename extension for shortcuts to local files, and .URL for shortcuts to remote files, like web pages. Commonly referred to as \"shortcuts\" or \"link files\", both are displayed with a curled arrow overlay icon by default, and no filename extension. (The extension remains hidden in Windows Explorer even when \"Hide extensions for known file types\" is unchecked in \"File Type\" options, because it is controlled by the NeverShowExt option in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\lnkfile in the Registry. The IsShortcut option causes the arrow to be displayed.) Shortcut files can be used to launch programs in minimized or maximized window states if the program supports it.\n\nMicrosoft Windows .lnk files operate as Windows Explorer extensions, rather than file system extensions. As a shell extension, .lnk files cannot be used in place of the file except in Windows Explorer, and have other uses in Windows Explorer in addition to use as a shortcut to a local file (or GUID). These files also begin with \"L\".\n\nAlthough shortcuts, when created, point to specific files or folders, they may break if the target is moved to another location. When a shortcut file that points to a nonexistent target is opened, Explorer will attempt to repair the shortcut. Windows 9x-based versions of Windows use a simple search algorithm to fix broken shortcuts. On Windows NT-based operating systems and the NTFS file system, the target object's unique identifier is stored in the shortcut file and Windows can use the \"Distributed Link Tracking\" service for tracking the targets of shortcuts, so that the shortcut may be silently updated if the target moves to another hard drive. Windows Installer, introduced in Windows 2000, added another special type of shortcuts called \"Advertised Shortcuts.\"\n\nFile shortcuts in Windows can store a working directory path besides the target path. Environment variables can be used. A hotkey can be defined in the shortcut's properties for shortcuts that are located in the Start Menu folders, pinned to the Taskbar or the Desktop. In Windows 2000 onwards, file shortcuts can store comments which are displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the shortcut.\n\nGenerally, the effect of double-clicking a shortcut is intended to be the same as double-clicking the application or document to which it refers, but Windows shortcuts contain separate properties for the target file and the \"Start In\" directory. If the latter parameter is not entered, attempting to use the shortcut for some programs may generate \"missing DLL\" errors not present when the application is accessed directly.\n\nFile system links can also be created on Windows systems (Vista and up). They serve a similar function, although they are a feature of the file system. Windows shortcuts are files and work independently of the file system, through Explorer.\n\nBeginning with Windows 7, some shortcuts also store Application User Model IDs (AppUserModelIDs). Instead of the target command line, AppUserModelIDs may directly be used to launch applications. Shortcuts with AppUserModelIDs are used by some desktop programs and all WinRT Modern/Universal Windows Platform apps for launching.\n\nAlthough Windows does not provide convenient tools to create it, Explorer supports a \"folder link\" or \"shell link folder\": a folder with the system attribute set, containing a hidden \"desktop.ini\" (folder customization) file which tells Explorer to look in that same folder for a \"target.lnk\" shortcut file pointing to another folder. When viewed in Explorer, the shell link folder then appears to have the contents of the target folder in it—that is, the customized folder becomes the effective shortcut. This technique is used by Microsoft Windows for items like WebDAV folders. The advent of file system links in Windows Vista and up has made shell link folders less useful.\n\nThere is another type of file that is similar to a “.lnk” file, but has the extension “.cda”. This is used to reference a track (song) on a CD (in standard CDDA / RedBook format)\n\nSome desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems, such as GNOME or KDE provide freedesktop.org .desktop files. These can be used to point to local or remote files, folders, and applications. Symbolic links can also be created on Unix systems, which serve a similar function, although they are a feature of the file system.\n\nFollowing are some of the window managers which support the use of shortcut icons on the desktop:\n\nMacintosh does not have extensions for shortcuts, although symbolic links can be created within the Unix subsystem.\nThe extension .webloc is used for Internet URLs within the Safari browser. The correct term for file \"shortcuts\" is \"alias\". Aliases in Macintosh System 7 through Mac OS 9 were distinguished from other files by using names in italics. In Mac OS 8 and later, another distinguishing mark was added: an \"alias arrow\"a black arrow on a small white square similar to that used for shortcuts in Microsoft Windows. In Mac OS X, the names of aliases are no longer italicized, but the arrow badge remains. Additionally, an alias retains its dynamic reference to an object and does not have to be specified even when calling files on remote servers.\n\nTo execute an application or render a file in early graphical user interfaces, the user had to click on the representation of the actual file or executable in the location where the application or file was. The concept of disassociating the executable from the icon representing an instruction to perform a task associated with that file or executable so that they may be grouped by function or task rather than physical organisation in the file structure was first described in the research paper \"A Task Oriented Front End For The Windows Graphical User Interface\", published in 1991 by Kingston University and presented to both Microsoft and Xerox EuroPARC that same year under an academia/business technology sharing agreement. A simplified form of this research was incorporated into System 7 in 1991, and four years later into Windows 95.\n\n\n"}

The company is known for its use of non-traditional designs and materials. Zon Guitars is associated with endorser and player Michael Manring, who collaborated with the company in the mid-1990s to design the innovative Zon Hyperbass instrument, a bass guitar that enables the player to retune the instrument during play.\n\nThere are five primary models of Zon Bass guitars: the Mosaic series, the Sonus series, the Legacy Elite, the VB and the Hyperbass. Many models are available in a variety of configurations such as five or six-string models or models with custom electronics or woods. A signature feature of the Zon basses is the use of Phenowood instead of wood as the material for the fingerboard, laid on top of a neck made of wood composite. Phenowood is wood, often birch, that has been impregnated with a phenolic resin, layered and compressed under heat. The necks of Zon guitars that use these rigid materials usually do not have truss rods, since they are not subject to bowing. String height is adjusted from the bridge. The tone generated by these materials is clear and bell-like, and players such as Manring and Zander Zon use these qualities to incorporate harmonics prominently in their playing.\n\nThe Hyperbass is a fretless four-string model which has a radical body shape featuring an extended cutaway to give access to a three-octave fretless fingerboard. The biggest departure from traditional construction is the use of four detuning heads (usually basses have at most one) and a unique bridge design, which allows selective tuning changes of one or more strings. This design allows quick changes to a vast selection of altered tunings. The design also incorporates four separate transducers mounted in various locations on the instrument and uses a special output connector to allow access to these individual signals in addition to the signal from the magnetic pickup.\n\nZon is also known as the first manufacturer to offer an optical pickup system from Lightwave Systems as a standard option on its basses. Zon had elements of their graphite necks made by Modulus Guitars until Modulus' patent for Graphite neck construction ran out in the early 1990s.\n\nZon has made numerous one-off custom bass guitars over the years for many popular bass guitar players. The list includes the following musicians:\n\nArtist who play/have played Zon basses are:\n\n"}

Though he was born in Perugia he claimed to have been born in Rome. His family name was Buonamici, but Agostino adopted the surname Tassi to give substance to his story that he was adopted by the Marchese Tassi. He was actually the son of a furrier named Domenico.\n\nTassi may have worked for a time in Livorno, as well as in Florence. Among his followers or pupils in Livorno is thought to be Pietro Ciafferi. During his sojourn in Florence it is believed that he was made a galley slave in the Grand Duke's convict galleys for some unspecified crime. However, he was allowed to move about freely on the ship instead of pulling on an oar. More importantly, he was able to paint and draw on the galley, and was thus provided with ample material from which to execute his seascapes and images of ports, ships, and fishing scenes.\n\nRegarding his artistic formation, Tassi is said to have been a pupil of Paul Bril, from whom he derived some of his images of the sea. He later worked in Rome with Orazio Gentileschi, who painted figures, after being commissioned by Pope Paul V. During his stay, he raped Orazio's daughter, the painter Artemisia Gentileschi.\n\nConsidered a master of perspective and a good painter of illusionistic architectural decoration, Tassi painted in several Roman palaces including the Quirinale (1611–12), the Rospigliosi and the Doria Pamphili (1637).\n\nIn Rome, Tassi also served as the master (from April 1625) of French painter Claude Lorrain. Tassi hired Lorrain to grind his colors and to do all of the household work.\n\nThough better known as a painter of frescoes, Tassi also painted some canvases, which include \"Arrival of the Queen of Sheba before Solomon\" (c. 1610) and \"Entry of Taddeo Barberini from the Porta del Popolo\" (1632). His depictions of night scenes had a certain influence on the Dutch Leonaert Bramer.\n\nIn 1612, Tassi was convicted of raping Artemisia Gentileschi, an Italian Baroque painter with an international clientele. Tassi originally denied the accusation, stating, \"Never have I had carnal relations nor tried to have it with the said Artemisia... I've never been alone in Artemisia's house with her.\" He afterwards claimed that he had visited her house in order to safeguard her honor. Tassi had already run afoul of the law, and had earlier been accused of raping both his sister-in-law and one of his wives. His wife had been missing for a time, and it was believed that Tassi had hired bandits to kill her.\n\nIn the ensuing seven-month rape trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had committed incest with his sister-in-law and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. At the end of the trial Tassi was imprisoned for two years. His verdict was later annulled and he was at liberty in 1613. His crime and its impact on her has subsequently influenced the feminist view of Artemisia Gentileschi during the late 20th century.\n\nIn the 1997 film \"Artemisia\", directed by Agnès Merlet and starring Valentina Cervi, the role of Tassi is played by Serbian actor Miki Manojlovic. The movie, contrary to accepted historical knowledge, depicted the relationship between Agostino Tassi and Artemisia Gentileschi as one of mutual passion. Tassi was, however, actually convicted of and briefly imprisoned for the rape.\n\n\n"}

The Admiral appointed judges to decide causes relating to maritime affairs, including both civil and criminal jurisdiction, and jurisdiction over creeks, fresh and navigable waterways. The duties were exercised through Vice-Admirals and Admirals-Depute, later called Judge Admirals.\n\nApart from occasional earlier references, the office seems to have originated in the early 15th century and was once held by Sir Robert Logan of Grugar, later also of Restalrig and the Earls of Bothwell and the Dukes of Lennox. It was one of the heritable offices that Charles II gave to his illegitimate son Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond and Lennox.\n\nThe earliest surviving records of the Scottish High Court of Admiralty date from 1557, convened under the authority of the Earl of Bothwell, in Edinburgh or Leith. Although all maritime causes in Scotland below a river's first bridge were in its view, it was inferior to the Court of Session, and its authority was contested by the Court of Justiciary in criminal matters. The Court was formally to be held, \"fenced\", within the sea-flood and wherever it was actually held the Admiral would declare that to be the case. The judges were Bothwell's two vice-admirals, men otherwise unknown who were almost certainly professional lawyers rather than mariners.\n\nBy the Act of Union 1707 all admiralty jurisdictions were placed under the Lord High Admiral of Great Britain or Commissioners of the Admiralty. Nevertheless, the Vice-Admiral of Scotland who received his commission from the Crown continued to appoint the Judge Admiral (until 1782) and Admirals-depute and to rank as an Officer of the Crown.\n\nThe Public Offices (Scotland) Act 1817 provided that no person thereafter appointed as Vice Admiral should receive a salary. The Admiralty Court in Edinburgh was abolished in 1830 and the Court of Session granted subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a poor batsman, passing fifty just once in his career and averaging barely eight in first-class cricket. He had three seasons in English county cricket, with Kent County Cricket Club in 1984 and 1986 and with Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 1988.\n\nIn the 1981 Ashes series he took 42 Test wickets, including nine on debut, the biggest haul in a series since Jim Laker's 46 in 1956 and the fourth-highest total of all time. Alderman's 42 wickets is the record for the most wickets taken in a series without taking 10 wickets in a match. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the Almanack's 1982 edition.\n\nHe was injured and unable to play for over a year by a shoulder injury sustained on 13 November 1982 when he rashly tackled an English-supporting ground invader at the WACA Ground in Perth.\n\nAlderman took part in an unofficial Australian tour of South Africa in 1985–86 and 1986–87, when that country was banned from Test cricket as a Commonwealth anti-apartheid sanction. As a result, he received a 3-year ban from international cricket which disqualified him from playing in the 1985 Ashes series in England.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Alderman returned to the Australian side and resumed his success against England, taking 41 wickets in the 1989 Ashes series and another 16 in the 1990–91 series, his final Ashes appearance. He rarely enjoyed similar success against other countries. His final Test series was against the West Indies in 1990–91, where he ended his career with 170 Test wickets.\n\nAlderman was born at Subiaco, Western Australia, the fourth of five children. His father, William, represented Western Australia in Australian Rules Football and opened the batting and bowling for Western Australia Colts without ever playing first-class cricket.\n\nAlderman studied at Aquinas College in Perth, playing both football and cricket. He bowled in his high school team's first eleven from his third year at high school onwards and was coached by Bert Rigg during his last two years. Alderman represented Western Australia at a schoolboys' carnival in Melbourne in 1972-73 and was chosen in the Australian schoolboys team to play a governors eleven.\n\nIn 1973-74 Alderman played for WA Colts in Melbourne and Adelaide. He too six wickets in a game in Melbourne. He made his first-class debut in 1974/75. In his first game, a Gillette Cup match, Ian Chappell took 24 runs off his second over. He was twelfth man for two Sheffield Shield games against South Australia and Victoria before being picked against New South Wales in Sydney. He took 5/63 but pulled a hamstring and had to return home. In total he took 18 first-class wickets that summer at an average of 28.\n\nThe following summer he took 17 wickets at 26 and in 1976/77 he only took 8 wickets at 17. During World Series Cricket, Alderman took 28 wickets at 21 during the 1977/78 summer. The following season he took 26 wickets at 18.69, but was overlooked for national selection.\n\nAlderman had his best season in 1979/80 taking 42 wickets at 28.09 before going to play for Watsonians in Scotland in the northern summer of 1980. In 1980-81 he took 32 wickets at 26, a performance which earned him selection on the 1981 Ashes tour.\n\nAlderman had a superb Ashes series.\n\nHe was picked in the first test and took 4/68 and 5/62, helping bowl Australia to victory. He found things harder going in the second, with 1-79 and 1-42, a game that ended in a draw. In the third test Alderman took 3/59 in the first innings; England followed on, and Alderman helped reduce England to 7-135 with 4 wickets and two catches. Ian Botham counter-attacked and Alderman's final figures were 6/135 - Australia collapsed chasing and lost the game.\n\nIn the fourth test Alderman bowled beautifully for figures of 5/42 and 3/65 but Australia's batsman collapsed again and lost the game. Australia lost the fifth test, Alderman taking 4/88 and 5/109. In the sixth drawn test Alderman took 3/84 and 2/60. He had taken 42 wickets in the test series at 51 first class wickets on tour at 20.86.\n\nAlderman was picked as one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year.\n\nAlderman kept in the Australian side the following summer. In the first test against Pakistan he took 4/36 and 2/43, helping Australia win. The going was harder in the second test, with 2/74 and 0/37. In the third test Alderman went for 0/62.\n\nAlderman played in two tests against the West Indies. He took 2/54 and 2/23 in the first match, but is probably best remembered for his batting in the first innings - he joined Kim Hughes when the score was 9/155 and stuck around for 43 more runs which proved crucial (Alderman made 10). He suffered in the second test, taking 0/73 and 1/46. Alderman did not play in the third test, which the West Indies won.\n\nHe took 37 first class wickets that summer at 16.94.\n\nAlderman toured New Zealand in 1982 taking 12 wickets at 30 and was picked for the 1982 tour of Pakistan. Australia went with a two-spin attack for the first two tests and Alderman was left out. He returned for the third test despite barely bowling during the tour, taking 2/144 in an Australian defeat. He only took four first class wickets on tour at 65.\n\nAlderman was injured in the first test of the 1982/83 Ashes. He had taken 1/84 in the first innings when there was a pitch invasion. Alderman was hit in the back of the head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, \"he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the vicinity so I attempted to apprehend him.\" Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. \"I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed,\" Alderman said. \"At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again,\" he said. \"I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career.\"\n\nHe took 18 first class wickets that summer at 19.61.\n\nAlderman was unable to force his way back into the Australian side over the 1983/84 summer. However 30 first class wickets at 25.26 saw him picked for the West Indies.\n\nAlderman was selected for the tour of the West Indies in 1984. He took 1/64 and 0/43 in the first test. In the second test he took 2/91 but had some success with the bat, scoring 21 in Australia's second innings and taking part in a 61-run partnership with Alan Border. In the third test Alderman took 1/152 and 0/18. He was dropped for the final two tests. Alderman took 15 first class wickets on tour at 43.6. After the tour he played his first season of county cricket in England with Kent County Cricket Club.\n\nAlderman made his way back into the Australian side for the first test against the West Indies during 1984/85. He took 6/128 but the West Indies won by an innings. He took 3/107 in the second test, which ended with Kim Hughes' resignation as Australian captain. After going wicketless in the third Test he was dropped for the final two Tests of the series.\n\nAlderman took 44 wickets at 28.34 that summer. He was picked to tour England in 1985 but lost his spot when it was revealed he had signed to play in South Africa. Alderman says he was motivated by financial conditions after being left off the contract list of Australian players in 1984. \"The board was; not thinking of me for the future.!

It is also known as Holy point, because it was originally used in liturgical laces. The Puritans were the first to make common usage of Hollie point beginning in the reign of James I.\n\nHollie point is a flat needlepoint lace whose name derives either from lace made for religious purposes (\"holy work\") or from the holes that create the pattern. It is made up of rows of twisted buttonhole stitches worked over horizontal threads. At the end of each row, the stitching returns back to the starting pint, creating the next horizontal thread. Simple pinprick designs are created by leaving gaps, or holes, in the otherwise plain cloth work formed by the buttonhole stitches. \n\nHollie point has always been more or a domestic, rather than a professional, art. Hollie point was used primarily on baby clothes in the 18th and early 19th century, especially, christening sets. The lace was stitched in the crown of baby bonnets, or caps, and sometimes on a band that extended from the centre front of the cap to the nape of the neck. The shoulder seams of small shirts were decorated with initials, dates, and mottoes. Lace designs included religious motifs such as lilies of the annunciation, Tree of life, Star of Bethlehem, dove of peace, and Crown of Glory. \n\nEarlier mentions of similarly-named laces, such as collars of \"hollie work\" that were listed in an inventory of Mary Queen of Scots, are thought to refer to other types of needlework that were done as \"holy work\".\n\n"}

BiOS was officially launched on 10 February 2005 by Cambia, an independent, international non-profit organization dedicated to democratizing innovation. Its intention is to initiate new norms and practices for creating tools for biological innovation, using binding covenants to protect and preserve their usefulness, while allowing diverse business models for the application of these tools.\n\nAs described by Richard Anthony Jefferson, CEO of Cambia, the Deputy CEO of Cambia, Dr Marie Connett worked extensively with small companies, university offices of technology transfer, attorneys, and multinational corporations to create a platform to share productive and sustainable technology. The parties developed the BiOS Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) and the BiOS license as legal instruments to facilitate these goals.\n\nTraditionally, the term 'open source' describes a paradigm for software development associated with a set of collaborative innovation practices, which ensure access to the end product's source materials - typically, source code. The BiOS Initiative has sought to extend this concept to the biological sciences, and agricultural biotechnology in particular. BiOS is founded on the concept of sharing scientific tools and platforms so that innovation can occur at the 'application layer.' Jefferson observes that, 'Freeing up the tools that make new discoveries possible will spur a new wave of innovation that has real value.' He notes further that, 'Open source is an enormously powerful tool for driving efficiency.'\n\nThrough BiOS instruments, licensees cannot appropriate the fundamental kernel of a technology and improvements exclusively for themselves. The base technology remains the property of whichever entity developed it, but improvements can be shared with others that support the development of a protected commons around the technology.\n\nTo maintain legal access to the technology, in other words, licensees must agree not to prevent others who have agreed to the same terms from using the technology and any improvements in the development of different products\n\nBy making the BiOS license cost-free, Cambia has sought to create 'freedom to innovate' in the scientific community. In lieu of royalties and other restrictions often imposed by legal agreements, the BiOS licenses impose on the licensee conditions to encourage cooperation and development of the technology. To be granted full, unfettered commercial rights to listed technologies, licensees are required to comply with three conditions:\n\nAs with other legal instruments, definitions used in the BiOS licenses are important. The scope and core capabilities of the enabling technologies and platforms should be carefully defined to provide confidence in the development of viable business models surrounding the use of the BiOS license.\n\nThe adoption of the BiOS licenses has now extended to over 300 licensees worldwide.\n\nBiOS has also issued a series of Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs), a common form of bailment used to provide materials for life sciences research, such as bacterial strains, plant lines, cell cultures, or DNA. MTAs able to be adapted for biological materials are available on the BiOS site.\n\nCambiaLabs engineered two ‘open source’ biological technologies, TransBacter and GUSPlus, which they released under the BiOS Initiative. The first, TransBacter, was designed to work around the intense patenting associated with the making of transgenic plants. \nCambia identified that the majority of patents claiming methods for plant transgenics make explicit reference to the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens; therefore, the use of a bacterium outside the genus Agrobacterium would not be subject to existing patent claims. Cambia published its work on TransBacter, which uses bacteria from the genera Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Mesorhizobium in 2005 in \"Nature\". TransBacter is available to all non-profit researchers and institutes upon signing a BiOS MTA. For-profit companies are asked to sign a BiOS license and to make a contribution to Cambia which is calculated on the company’s financial means.\n\nAn inventory of BiOS-licensed patents is available at the Cambia site.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020952", "title": "Julia the Elder", "text": "Julia the Elder\n\nJulia the Elder (30 October 39 BC – AD 14), known to her contemporaries as Julia Caesaris filia or Julia Augusti filia (Classical Latin: or ), was the daughter of Augustus Caesar, the first Roman Emperor, and his second wife, Scribonia. Julia was also stepsister and second wife of the Emperor Tiberius; maternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and the Empress Agrippina the Younger; grandmother-in-law of the Emperor Claudius; and maternal great-grandmother of the Emperor Nero. Her epithet 'the Elder' distinguishes her from her daughter, Julia the Younger.\n\nAt the time of Julia's birth, 39 BC, Augustus had not yet received the title \"Augustus\" and was known as \"Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius,\" though historians refer to him as \"Octavian\" until 27 BC, when Julia was 11. Octavian divorced Julia's mother the day of her birth and took Julia from her soon thereafter. Octavian, in accordance with Roman custom, claimed complete parental control over her. She was sent to live with her stepmother Livia when she was old enough and learn how to be an aristocrat. Her education appears to have been strict and somewhat old-fashioned. Thus, in addition to her studies, Suetonius informs us, she was taught spinning and weaving. Macrobius mentions \"her love of literature and considerable culture, a thing easy to come by in that household\".\n\nJulia's social life was severely controlled, and she was allowed to talk only to people whom her father had vetted. However, Octavian had a great affection for his daughter and made sure she had the best teachers available. Macrobius preserves a remark of Augustus: \"There are two wayward daughters that I have to put up with: the Roman commonwealth and Julia.\"\n\nIn 37 BC, during Julia's early childhood, Octavian's friends Gaius Maecenas and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa concluded an agreement with Octavian's great rival Mark Antony. It was sealed with an engagement: Antony's ten-year-old son Marcus Antonius Antyllus was to marry Julia, then two years old.\n\nThe engagement never led to a marriage because civil war broke out. In 31 BC, at the Battle of Actium, Octavian and Agrippa defeated Antony and his wife, Cleopatra. In Alexandria, they both committed suicide, and Octavian became sole ruler of the Roman Empire.\n\nAs with most aristocratic Roman women of the period, expectations of Julia focused on marriage and on the resulting family alliances. Moreover, Augustus desired a male issue; as his only living child Julia's duty would be to provide her father with grandsons whom he could adopt as his heirs. \n\nIn 25 BC, at the age of fourteen, Julia married her first cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the son of her father's sister Octavia, who was some three years older than her. Augustus himself was not present for the wedding as he was fighting a war in Spain and had fallen ill. Instead, he commissioned Agrippa to preside over the ceremony and hold the festival in his absence.\n\nThe decision to marry Marcellus to Julia, and then Augustus's choice to raise Marcellus to the pontificate and curule aedileship, was perceived to be an indication that he would be Augustus' successor in power, despite his youth. This put him at odds with Agrippa, whom people believed would oppose Marcellus' accession to power; the apparent preference for Marcellus is allegedly the catalyst that led to Agrippa to withdraw to Mytilene, Greece.\n\nHowever, Marcellus died in September 23 BC when Julia was sixteen. The union produced no children.\n\nIn 21 BC, having now reached the age of 18, Julia married Agrippa, a man from a modest family who had risen to become Augustus' most trusted general and friend. This step is said to have been taken partly on the advice of Maecenas, who in counseling him remarked: \"You have made him so great that he must either become your son-in-law or be slain.\" Since Agrippa was nearly 25 years her elder, it was a typical arranged marriage, with Julia functioning as a pawn in her father's dynastic plans. There is from this period the report of an infidelity with one Sempronius Gracchus, with whom Julia allegedly had a lasting \"liaison\" (Tacitus describes him as \"a persistent paramour\"). This was the first of a series of alleged adulteries. According to Suetonius, Julia's marital status did not prevent her from conceiving a passion for Augustus' stepson, and thus her stepbrother, Tiberius, so it was widely rumoured.\n\nThe newlyweds lived in a villa in Rome that has since been excavated near the modern Farnesina in Trastevere. Agrippa and Julia's marriage resulted in five children: Gaius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Lucius Caesar, Agrippina the Elder (mother of Caligula), and Agrippa Postumus (a posthumous son). From June 20 BC to the spring of 18 BC, Agrippa was governor of Gaul, and it is likely that Julia followed him across the Alps. Shortly after their arrival, their first child Gaius was born, and in 19 BC, Julia gave birth to Vipsania Julia. After their return to Italy, a third child followed: a son named Lucius. In 17 BC, Augustus adopted the newborn Lucius and the three-year-old Gaius. He took care of their education personally. Although Agrippa died in 12 BC, Augustus did not adopt the third brother, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Posthumus, until AD 4, after the exile of Julia - and after the deaths of both Gaius and Lucius.\n\nNicolaus and Josephus mention that during Julia's marriage to Agrippa, she travelled to meet Agrippa where he was campaigning. She was caught up in a flash flood in Ilium (Troy), and almost drowned. Agrippa was furious, and in his anger he fined the locals 100,000 drachmae. The fine was a heavy blow but no one would face Agrippa to request an appeal. Only after Herod, king of Judaea, went to Agrippa to request a pardon did he withdraw the fine. In the spring of 16 BC, Agrippa and Julia started a tour through the eastern provinces, where they visited Herod. In October 14 BC, the couple traveled to Athens, where Julia gave birth to her fourth child, Agrippina.\n\nAfter the winter, the family returned to Italy. Julia quickly became pregnant again, but her husband died suddenly in March 12 BC in Campania at the age of 51. He was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Julia named the son Marcus in his honor. He was to be known as Agrippa Postumus. Immediately after the boy was born, and while Julia was still in mourning, Augustus had her betrothed and then remarried to Tiberius, her stepbrother.\n\nAfter the death of Agrippa, Augustus sought to promote his step-son Tiberius, believing that this would best serve his own dynastic interests. Tiberius married Julia (11 BC), but first had to divorce Vipsania Agrippina (daughter from a previous marriage of Agrippa), the woman he dearly loved. Suetonius alleges that Tiberius had a low opinion of Julia's character, while Tacitus claims that she disdained Tiberius as an unequal match and even sent his father a letter, written by Sempronius Gracchus, denouncing him. The marriage was thus blighted almost from the start, and the son that Julia bore him died in infancy. By 6 BC, when Tiberius departed for Rhodes, if not earlier, the couple had separated.\n\nBecause Augustus was her legitimate father, having married her mother with \"conubium\", Augustus had Patria Potestas over her. \"Patria Potestas\" lasted until the paterfamilias, Augustus, either died or emancipated his child. Marriage had no effect on \"Patria Potestas\", unless it was manus marriage which was rare at this point in time.\n\nAs the daughter of Augustus, mother (now legally the sister) of two of his heirs, Lucius and Gaius, and wife of another, Tiberius, Julia's future seemed assured to all. Yet in 2 BC she was arrested for adultery and treason; Augustus sent her a letter in Tiberius' name declaring the marriage null and void (Tiberius was at this time on the island of Rhodes and unable to respond quickly). He also asserted in public that she had been plotting against his own life. Though at the time Augustus had been passing legislation to promote family values, he likely knew of her intrigues with other men but hesitated for some time to accuse her. Several of Julia's supposed lovers were exiled, most notably Sempronius Gracchus, while Iullus Antonius (son of Mark Antony and Fulvia) was forced to commit suicide. Others have suggested that Julia's alleged paramours were members of her city clique, who wished to remove Tiberius from favour and replace him with Antonius. This would explain the letter, written by Gracchus, asking Augustus to allow Julia to divorce Tiberius.\n\nReluctant to execute her, Augustus decided instead to confine Julia on Pandateria, an island that measures less than , with no men in sight and forbidden even to drink wine. Her mother, Scribonia, accompanied her into exile. She was allowed no visitor unless her father had given permission and had been informed of the stature, complexion, and even of any marks or scars upon his body. \n\nIn AD 6, Julia's youngest son, Agrippa Postumus, was exiled for his growing unruliness. Then in 8 her elder daughter, Julia the Younger, was exiled to Tremirus also charged with adultery; it may also have been related to the attempted revolt by her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus and one Plautius Rufus. It is said that at any mention of Julia or her two disgraced children, Augustus would remark of them: \"If only I had never married, or had died childless\", slightly misquoting Hector, in the Iliad. \n\nFive years after her initial exile, around AD 4, Julia was moved to Rhegium on the mainland and Augustus appears to have granted her a \"peculium\" (property), a yearly income and permitted her to walk about the town. Despite these concessions Augustus never forgave her nor ever allowed her to return to Rome. This choice appears to have been unpopular with the Roman people who petitioned several times for her to be recalled. Julia's exile cast a long shadow over Augustus's remaining years. There is mention of at least one suppressed plot to take her from captivity; one Lucius Audasius and one Asinius Epicadus had planned to forcibly take her and her son Agrippa Postumus from where they were held and to the armies, presumably to stage a coup against Augustus.\n\nUpon Augustus' death in 14, Tiberius ascended to the Princeps. Despite having shown some sympathy towards Julia when she was initially exiled, he instead enforced harsher conditions upon her. He removed her dowry and yearly income, citing that Augustus had failed to make provisions for them in his will, and thus left her destitute. Furthermore, he denied her permission to leave her house or receive visitors.\n\nJulia died in 14 AD, some time after Augustus' death. While it is generally agreed by contemporary historians that it was as a result of Tiberius's actions against her, the circumstances of her death are obscure. Dio Cassius indicates Tiberius had a direct hand in her death by imprisoning her until she died either from debility or starvation. Tacitus remarks that upon learning Postumus had been murdered, she succumbed to despair and her health slowly declined. Augustus had explicitly given instructions in his will that she should not be buried in his Mausoleum of Augustus.\n\nSimultaneously, her alleged \"paramour\" Sempronius Gracchus, who had endured 14 years of exile on Cercina (Kerkenna) off the African coast, was executed either at Tiberius' instigation or on the independent initiative of Nonius Asprenas, proconsul of Africa.\n\nHer daughter Julia died in AD 29 after 20 years of exile; she was also forbidden to be buried in Augustus' tomb by his will.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, after his own ascension Caligula, the son of Julia's daughter Agrippina and Tiberius's nephew Germanicus, would claim that his mother Agrippina was the product of an incestuous union between Julia and Augustus. The reason for this is allegedly because he did not wish to be thought of as the grandson of Agrippa due to his humble origins. However, the existence of coins and inscriptions dating from Caligula's reign that clearly identify Agrippina as Agrippa's daughter suggests this account is apocryphal.\n\nAmong contemporary writers Julia is almost universally remembered for her flagrant and promiscuous conduct. Thus Marcus Velleius Paterculus (2.100) describes her as \"tainted by luxury or lust\", listing among her lovers Iullus Antonius, Quintius Crispinus, Appius Claudius, Sempronius Gracchus, and Cornelius Scipio. Seneca the Younger refers to \"adulterers admitted in droves\"; Pliny the Elder calls her an “\"exemplum licentiae\"” (\"NH\" 21.9). Dio Cassius mentions \"revels and drinking parties by night in the Forum and even upon the Rostra\" (\"Roman History\" 55.10). Seneca (\"De Beneficiis\" 6.32) tells us that the Rostra was the place where \"her father had proposed a law against adultery\", and yet now she had chosen the place for her \"debaucheries\". Seneca specifically mentions prostitution: \"laying aside the role of adulteress, she there [\"in the Forum\"] sold her favours, and sought the right to every indulgence with even an unknown paramour.\" Modern historians discredit these representations as exaggerating Julia's behaviour.\n\nMacrobius provides invaluable details of her witticisms and personality. Among the sassy ripostes he attributes to her is a retort to people's surprise that all her children all resembled Agrippa - “I take on a passenger only when the ship’s hold is full.” On her character, he writes that Julia was extensively celebrated for her amiable, empathetic nature and studiousness despite her profligacy: \"[S]he was abusing her standing as fortune’s darling, and her father’s, though in other respects she gained a great deal of credit for her love of literature and extensive learning... and her kindness, fellow-feeling, and lack of cruelty.\"\n\nSidonius Apollinaris, writing in the 5th century, was the first person to identify Julia as the figure Corinna in Ovid's \"Amores\".\n\n\n\nIn 1605, the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga published a tract (later quoted by Kepler), which for the first time suggested that Jesus was born sometime during the years 6-4 BC, not on December 25, 1 BC as Dionysius Exiguus implied, but never stated. According to Dionysius' dating scheme, the Christian era supposedly began on January 1, AD 1 about one week after Jesus' birth at the end of December. Julia's expulsion from Rome in 2 BC was featured in Suslyga's chronological argument which sought to establish Herod's death in 4 BC. Suslyga's chronological ideas concerning the dating of Herod's death based on Julia the Elder's exile have since been challenged by archaeologists.\n\n\n\n"}

During its peak, the Sugar Railways included over 3000 km of track though by 2003 only 240 km remained. Regular passenger service was discontinued in 1982 as the need for train service to rural areas dwindled with the increasing urbanization of Taiwan and the dominance of highways. More lines were closed in the 1990s as the importance of the sugar industry decreased. Generally the remaining lines are only in operation during the sugarcane harvest season. With domestic sugarcane production dwindling in recent years, rail operations have been sporadic. Some short distance train services resumed in 2003, now mostly catering to tourists and residents wishing to relive childhood memories.\n\nTypically, most of the Sugar Railway lines centered on the many sugar mills in southern and central Taiwan, radiating outwards through sugarcane fields and small towns. Most of the lines were also linked with stations shared with the main railway lines allowing passengers to transfer to long distance trains. Trains carrying sugarcane and passengers ran along the Sugar Railway lines at relatively slow speeds of roughly 10 km/h.

The national version was presented by Nancy Terrell. \"Romper Room\" was also franchised internationally at various times in Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Finland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\n\"Romper Room\" was a rare case of a series being both franchised and syndicated, so local affiliates—Los Angeles and New York being prime examples—could produce their own versions of the show instead of airing the national telecast. For some time, local shows all over the world used the same script but with local children; some affiliates, starting with KWEX-TV in San Antonio, translated the scripts into Spanish for local airings. Kids would be on waiting lists for years (sometimes before birth) to be on the show. It was called \"an actual kindergarten\". Originally filmed in Baltimore from its inception in 1953, \"Romper Room\" eventually moved its broadcast facilities to Chicago and then moved back to Baltimore in 1981.\n\nEach program opens with a greeting from the hostess and the Pledge of Allegiance in American broadcasts. The hostess and her group of children then embark on 30 or 60 minutes of games, exercises, songs, story-telling and moral lessons, which were regularly accompanied by background music. The hostess (or sometimes the children in cadence) would ask, \"Mr. Music, please!\" or \"We're ready, Mr. Music,\" to prompt the background music. The young cast, which ranged from four to five years old, was rotated every two months. Many of the hostesses had prior experience working with small children and many were former kindergarten teachers.\n\nEtiquette was a focus of \"Romper Room.\" The hostesses were always addressed as \"Miss.\" The show also had a mascot, Mr. Do-Bee. Mr. Do-Bee was an oversized bumblebee who came to teach the children proper deportment. He was noted for always starting his sentence with \"Do Bee,\" as in the imperative \"Do be\"; for example, \"Do Bee good boys and girls for your parents!\" There was also a \"Mr. Don't Bee\" to show children exactly what they should \"not\" do. \"Do-Bee\" balloons were made available for purchase to the public. Each balloon featured a painted sketch of \"Do-Bee.\" When the balloons were inflated and then released, they would fly around slowly and emit a buzzing sound.\n\nThe hostess would also serve milk and cookies to the children. Before eating, they would recite the \"Romper Room\" prayer: \"God is great, God is good. Let us thank Him for our food. Amen.\"\n\nAt the end of each broadcast, the hostess would look through a \"magic mirror\"—actually an open frame with a handle, the size, and shape of a hand mirror—and recite the rhyme, \"Romper, bomper, stomper boo. Tell me, tell me, tell me, do. Magic Mirror, tell me today, did all my friends have fun at play?\" She would then name the children she saw in \"television land,\" saying, for example, \"I can see Kathleen and Owen and Julie and Jimmy and Kelly and Tommy and Bobby and Jennifer and Martin\" and so forth. Children were encouraged to mail in their names, which would be read on the air (first names only).\n\nThe show used the then-popular Mattel Jack-in-the-box for its opening and closing titles (sometimes called \"Happy Jack\"), with its traditional nursery rhyme \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" as a theme song. Beginning in 1981, a new original theme song was used.\n\nIn 1981, the format of \"Romper Room\" was overhauled and re-titled \"Romper Room and Friends\". One hundred syndicated versions were taped in Baltimore with Miss Molly as host. At that point they no longer used teachers. The biggest change to the program was the introduction of a series of new puppet characters, including a full costume character named Kimble, and puppets named Granny Cat and Up-Up. Kimble and Up-Up were performed by Bruce Edward Hall and Granny Cat by Molly McCloskey aka \"Miss Molly\". The three characters were developed by The Great Jones Studios in NYC. The new characters starred in a series of vignettes, somewhat similar to the \"Neighborhood of Make-Believe\" segments on \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", and were meant to introduce or reinforce simple moral lessons. About 100 of these skits — each running three to five minutes — were produced for insertion into local \"Romper Room\" programs; the host would introduce each segment and comment after its conclusion.\n\nIn addition, a new opening and closing credits sequence, and lyrical theme – \"Romper Room and Friends\", containing mostly nonsensical lyrics, but also naming the characters Up-Up, Do Bee, Granny Cat, and Kimble in the lyrics as well – were introduced, replacing the \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" theme that had been used.\n\nNancy Cledenin Terrell (born 1940, Richmond, Virginia) (known to audiences as \"Miss Nancy\") was the national hostess in the 1960s and early 1970s, when \"Romper Room\" was seen on ABC-owned and operated stations throughout the United States in locales that did not have their own hostesses.\n\nWhile the show aired until 1994, it is unclear when production for the show ended. Some believe that production ended in 1981. Others say that the national version was last produced in 1991, but that local versions continued to be produced until 1994.\n\n\"Romper Room\" had aired on Atlanta stations since the 1950s but, in December 1976, it found nationwide exposure as part of the WTCG morning lineup when Ted Turner began broadcasting the station's signal nationally via satellite. (3 years later, WTCG became SuperstationWTBS, while the programming remained essentially unchanged.) Unlike the nationally syndicated version, the WTCG/WTBS version of \"Romper Room\" was locally produced.\n\nIt is popular belief that the first \"Romper Room\" hostess was Nancy Claster (1915–1997), who helped produce the show with her husband Bert under the Claster Television banner. Though \"Miss Nancy\" was the long-term host of the show, produced at the studios of WBAL-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, she was not the first. Jean Moseley (1920-1998) hosted the show for the first few episodes in 1953. Then Nancy Claster took over until 1963, when she was replaced by her daughter Sally Bell (formerly Claster Gelbard, born c. 1942-1943). As \"Miss Sally\" she hosted the show, in Baltimore and the surrounding area, until 1980 when it was retitled. She remained working with her parents' television production company until 2000, when she retired; as of 2007, she was living in Pacific Palisades and married to TV and newspaper executive Alan J. Bell and has two children.\n\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana's version of Romper Room was hosted by Miss Pat Evans and began on January 7, 1957. Local NBC and ABC affiliate WBRZ-TV aired the program from 10 AM - 11 AM until 1959. From 1959 until 1961, a replacement program airing on Saturdays called Kiddie Kottage took its place but was still hosted by Miss Pat. With the success of WAFB-TV's rival program Storyland, WBRZ reintroduced Romper Room on May 21, 1961 to compete against WAFB-TV's Storyland. Unable to compete, Romper Room was cancelled February 1962.\n\nBiloxi, Mississippi has the unique distinction of having the only male Romper Room teacher in the entire existence of the show. Domenick Gitano (Mr. Dom) was the only host for the run of the show, which only ran from March 1966 to May 1967. Gitano died under mysterious circumstances in December 1967; he was found in his apartment stabbed in the back, and slightly over one half of a pound of high-grade heroin was found in the adjoining bathroom.\n\nMiss Jean (real name Jean Harrington) hosted the Boston area \"Romper Room\" (which aired on WHDH and its successor WCVB) for fourteen years. She was a graduate of Salem State College, in Salem, Massachusetts, where she majored in English and completed an education minor. A Swampscott native, she was a former high school teacher. Her husband at that time was WHDH news reporter Bill Harrington. The show aired with Miss Jean from 1958 to 1972. She was replaced in March 1972 by \"Miss Louise\" (Louise Lark, a 23-year-old school-teacher and a graduate of Boston University).\n\n\"Romper Room\" debuted on WGN in 1954, and ran until 1960. From 1961 to 1962, a nationally syndicated version aired. The local \"Romper Room\" returned a year later and ran from 1963 to 1975. Three of the Chicago hostesses were \"Miss Rosemary\" Rapp, \"Miss Beverly\" Marston-Braun (born 1930 - May 12, 2010, aged 79) and \"Miss Elizabeth\" Trench.\n\nCleveland hostess \"Miss Barbara\" (full name: Barbara R. (Bowen) Plummer), born in Norwalk on February 13, 1930 hosted the local version of \"Romper Room\" on WEWS Channel 5 from 1958 until 1971. She was also a weather presenter on Channel 5 and appeared on Captain Penny. She was a survivor of breast cancer in 1978, and lung cancer in 1996. She resided in South Euclid and died on March 20, 2010, at the age of 80 from cancer and pneumonia-related complications. She was survived by husband Gordon and two children.\n\n\"Miss Genie\" (Eugenie deLuise) hosted the Denver area \"Romper Room\" between 1962 and 1972 on KWGN-TV (which was KCTO prior to 1966). Denver's Miss Genie deLuise was also the \"Romper Room\" hostess in Phoenix from fall of 1957 to March 1959.\n\n\"Miss Ardis\" (Ardis Kenealey) hosted the Detroit Romper Room on WWJ-TV, channel 4, from 1954 until late 1959. At that point, CKLW-TV, across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario (see under Canada), picked up the rights to Romper Room, and began a version of the show hosted by Miss Flora (Flora Paulin).\n\nHostess \"Miss Marge\" Westerham (Sullivan) hosted the local version of Romper Room on KDAL-TV, channel 10 in Duluth/Superior Minnesota/Wisconsin in the mid-1960s.\n\n\"Miss Jean\" (Jeannie Moore) hosted the Grand Rapids, Michigan \"Romper Room\" on WOOD-TV, channel 8, from 1955 to 1968.\n\nThe Hawaiian version of \"Romper Room\" debuted in 1964 on KTRG (now KHNL) with \"Miss Robin\" (Robin Mann). After the station canceled the program in 1966, the show and its host moved over to KHON where it ran until 1972, when KHON replaced it with \"Today\". Mann later admitted that despite the success of \"Romper Room\" in Honolulu she felt that there wasn't any Hawaiian influence or culture being emphasized in the series during its run. In 1974, KHON bought Mann back for a series called \"Robin's Room\", which incorporated the Hawaiian culture but kept the \"Romper Room\" elements and ran until 1976.\n\nA version of the program aired on WJAC-TV out of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was originally hosted and taught by \"Miss Jean,\" Jean A. Federici (now Dobis) (born c. 1933) of Pittsburgh. A music education graduate of Indiana State Teacher's College in Indiana, Pennsylvania, she hosted the program from 1958 to 1961. \"Miss Patti\" Patti Hewitt was the hostess from October 1960 through December 1973. She was an elementary major and graduated from Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania. Miss Patti was replaced with \"Miss Mary\" Mary Parks until the end of its run about 1976.

She left WJAC in 1990 to become Sister Mary of the Sisters of St Joseph.\n\n\"Miss Virginia\" (Virginia Lee Hassenflu) hosted the Kansas City area Romper Room from 1954 to 1964 on KMBC. She died on November 7, 2016.\n\nA local version of Romper Room began airing March 1960 on KLFY shortly after WBRZ in Baton Rouge temporarily abandoned their Romper Room program. When WBRZ relaunched the program in 1961, KLFY's version went off the air. Around 1965, another iteration of Romper Room went on the air on KATC-TV airing at 9 AM. This version lasted until 1966.\n\n\"Miss Nadine\" (Nadia Delonas) hosted the Lansing Michigan area Romper Room in the early sixties on WJIM-TV.\n\nA local version of the program in Lexington, Kentucky, was hosted by \"Miss Roni,\" Roni Martin Scott, from 1974 until 1976 on WTVQ-TV.\n\nIn Los Angeles, \"Romper Room\" aired on KCOP-TV.

The second host of the program was Socorro Serrano, aka \"Miss Soco\", who hosted from 1977 until it ended in 1989 and was the first Latina of Mexican American heritage to host \"Romper Room\". Hostess Mary Ann King (Miss Mary Ann), a resident of Hacienda Heights died on June 16, 2016, aged 82.\n\nMargaret Jones, who hosted the Little Rock show as \"Miss Peggy\" between 1963 and 1966, went on to sing and to play tabla and keyboards for a locally popular psychedelic rock band called Campbell's Lavender Circus (or sometimes simply Lavender Circus). The sextet sold 2,000 copies statewide of their single, \"I Have No Time for Time\"/\"Mr. N. Bourbaki's Multicoloured Jam.\"\n\nMadison hostess Judy Fraser attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison and graduated with a B.A. in Speech Communications. She received an honorary scholarship and membership in the Phi Beta Honorary Society for outstanding academic work and the University's Outstanding Actress Award for her portrayal of Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.

She later married philanthropist and real estate developer Ben Tobin, with whom she had a daughter, Benita Tobin.\n\nThe Milwaukee version of \"Romper Room\" aired on WISN-TV, Channel 12.\n\nThe show aired on WTCN channel 11 (1955–62) and then on KMSP channel 9 (1962–74) hosted by Mary Betty Douglass (\"Miss Betty\") among others.\nThis version aired on WTEV (now WLNE-TV) Channel 6 and featured \"Miss Diane.\"\n\nVirginia Sherwood Carino, better known as \"Miss Ginny\", presided over the New Orleans version for almost a decade on WWL until her departure from the station in 1967. She later became one of the first female White House correspondents for ABC News, followed by a stint as a communications coach and consultant. Carino died of complications from Alzheimer's in 2012 at the age of 87. Local actress Linda Barnett Mintz took over the series following Carino's departure and remains an active TV and radio personality to this day.\n\nLinda Barnett Mintz, career began as a New Orleans' born child actress of radio and stage. She already possessed local celebrity upon being selected as the next Romper Room teacher for New Olreans. She appeared on the \"Miss Muffin Show\" with Terry Flettrich and \"Let's Tell a Story, which was a collaborative effort between the National Council of Jewish Women, WDSU-TV, and the New Orleans Public Library.\n\nLinda Mintz is well recognized for her voice-over work on many radio and television commercials. She is skillful, as a character actress in local theaters and national television movies. She has performed on every stage in New Orleans, as a mistress of ceremonies, songstress, lead in musical theatre and drama. She is best known for her portrayal as Amanda Wingfield, in Tennessee Williams' \"Glass Menagerie,\" and Desiree in Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler's \"A Little NIght Music.”\n\nHer loyal work with PBS has been a constant.

She has been honored with numerous civic awards and has been a board member for several charitable and artistic nonprofit organizations.\n\nMiss Linda is still an active participant in the New Orleans' community and continues to appear on television and radio. Although a studied actress, singer, and poet—with heart, depth and range—she remains the beloved last Miss Linda of New Orleans.\n\nIn New York City, the first hostess was \"Miss Gloria\" Flood on WABC-TV for the years 1955–57. \"Miss Joan\" Thayer became the new hostess when it moved to WNEW-TV (now WNYW) in 1957. Thayer made personal appearances throughout New York City. Her appearance at Freedomland U.S.A. in The Bronx is documented in the book, \"Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History\" (Theme Park Press, 2019). \"Miss Louise\" Redfield took over hosting duties at the same time the program moved over to WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) in 1966. \"Miss Louise\" was followed by \"Miss Mary Ann\" Pedersen, who began filling in for Louise in the early 1970s. After Louise Redfield left in 1975, Mary Ann Pederson took over the show until 1981.\n\nIn 1981, the station took the Baltimore-based \"Romper Room and Friends\" offered in syndication by Claster Television with new host \"Miss Molly\" McCloskey, (born as Mary Carol McClosky, later Barber) which gave the program nationwide carriage even in markets where it was not available on a broadcast station, as a result of WOR's superstation feed. Miss Molly gained a great deal of popularity with viewers and is still fondly remembered today. Children who were on the show for a week were on a waiting list for three to four years.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1971, WOR aired \"Romper Room\" during the 11 AM hour, then moved it back to 10 AM, where it would remain for most of the next 14 years. The station briefly moved it back to 9 AM in the fall of 1981, but returned it to 10 AM a month later, due to complaints that it was interfering with the airing of PBS's \"Sesame Street\". The show was aired \"live\" until 1985, at which time it was also pushed back to 8:30 AM. In the fall of 1987, after WOR-TV was sold and renamed WWOR, \"Romper Room\" was reduced to 30 minutes and moved to 6 AM, and production in the New York area was discontinued a year later. While many local versions ended in the late 1980s and early 1990s (and some ended in the early-to-mid 1980s), nationally syndicated episodes of \"Romper Room and Friends\" with \"Miss Molly\" stopped airing in 1994.\n\nMiss Nancy Besst (Canton, Ohio May 25, 1934 – August 14, 2011) hosted the San Francisco version on KTVU from 1958 to 1969. \"Miss Mary Ann\" Parks hosted from 1969 to 1979; \"Miss Teresa\" followed until 1981.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1987, the San Francisco Bay Area featured another version of \"Romper Room\", which was televised live from Oakland on local station KTVU. This version featured \"Ms. Nancy\", whose real name was Ruby Unger, a Mill Valley resident. There were several other local producer / teachers during the life of the show, which began in Baltimore, MD, in 1954.\n\n\"Miss Sharon\" Jeffery was the last \"Romper Room\" Teacher in Northern California. A fourth grade teacher at the time, she was hired and trained by Sally Claster Bell in Pacific Palisades, California. Miss Sharon was the only African-American hostess and was featured on \"Romper Room\" from 1987 to 1992, which was filmed at KTVU in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was the final teacher on the last \"Romper Room\" in the US.\n\nAn early \"Romper Room\" hostess was Claire Coleman, who was the original \"Miss Claire\" on WFIL (now WPVI-TV) from 1954 until 1956. During this time, she shared an office with Dick Clark from \"American Bandstand\". Claire Coleman was married to former U.S. Senator Richard Schweiker.\nAnother Philadelphia-based \"Romper Room\" hostess was Connie Roussin Spann.\n\nJan Ballard Bohna (\"Miss Jan\") was the first \"teacher\" in 1958 on WIIC-TV (later WPXI) until the program moved to WTAE in 1960, where she was replaced by \"Miss Janey\" Vance Braham for 10 years until her sudden death in 1969. Bohna, who had filled in as a substitute host for Braham during the 1960s run on WTAE, took over as host until the local version ended in 1976. WTAE also carried the national version on Saturday mornings in its later years.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the show was hosted by Bertita Novoa and later, by Sandra Zaiter.\n\nQuad Cities hostess \"Miss Peggy\" Wittke and \"Miss Jean\" Engman hosted the local version of \"Romper Room\" on WQAD-TV from the Mid 60s and into the '80s.\n\nIn Rochester, New York, where the show was carried on the newly founded WOKR, now WHAM-TV, it was hosted from 1962 to 1967 by Rita Barton who was known as \"Miss Rita,\" later founded an innovative child-care facility and continued her work for over 50 years after her debut on the program. Barton died in August 2016 at the age of 81. The role was later taken on by \"Miss Karen\" for a later portion of the program's run in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\n\"Miss Julie\" of KSL-TV's \"Romper Room\" was played by Edna Anderson-Taylor from 1964 through 1981. Some 6,100 children appeared on the program, and Anderson-Taylor was quoted saying that the program gives \"a big boost to a child's self-esteem\".\n\nIn the early years, Miss Margaret was the host followed by Miss Nancy. Miss Kay Lisicia hosted the Savannah version on WTOC during the early 1970s.\n\nThe initial host in the late 1950s and mid-1960s was Miss Elaine Schafer, a native of Decatur, Illinois who moved to the Pacific Northwest in the fall of 1958. Starting on Monday, June 28, 1965, Shafer retired and was replaced by was Miss Margaret, who was played by Margaret L. Lloyd, a former kindergarten teacher. The show aired on KSTW (at the time as KTNT-TV) Channel 11, from Tacoma. She hosted the show from mid-1965 into the 1970s.\n\nMiss Joan (Jane Pirtle) hosted the St. Louis version on KTVI from 1957–1962. She was replaced by Miss Lois (Lois Witzig), who hosted during the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nConstance Anne Bohlin (née Sullivan), born January 24, 1932, Massachusetts hosted the D.C. version on WTTG Channel 5 from 1957 to 1967, as \"Miss Connie\", she died on December 28, 1972, at her home in Gum Springs, Fairfax County, Virginia, aged 40, the coroner concluded she died from alcohol poisoning.\n\nMiss Barbara Balay was one of the first hosts of \"Romper Room\" on KAKE. She later married one of the first producers on the morning show, David Carl Dunn. He later wrote a book about their relationship, both on and off the air, called \"From Kansas to Hollywood.\"\n\n\"Miss Marti\" Watson Garlett was the final host of \"Romper Room\" on KAKE from 1977 to 1986, when KAKE canceled the show a few years after the FCC ceased requiring educational programs for children on commercial television (KAKE was and is an ABC affiliate). Garlett holds a Ph.D., and as a former classroom teacher (preschool through grade 3) was one of the few nationwide hosts who came from a child development background. She went on to create online teacher-preparation programs at Western Governors University, Walden University, and Kendall College, the latter in early childhood education. While she was hosting \"Romper Room\", she was also a full-time professor of elementary teacher education at Friends University in Wichita. She lovingly called \"Romper Room\" her \"moonlight job,\" and thought aloud that she should have paid for the privilege of being Miss Marti.\n\nTwo controversial events were connected with \"Romper Room\":\n\nIn 1962, the hostess of the Phoenix franchise of \"Romper Room\" linked her own name with that of the ongoing controversies over abortion. Sherri Chessen, known to television viewers as \"Miss Sherri,\" sought hospital approval for abortion on the ground that she had been taking thalidomide and believed her child would be born deformed. Chessen made a public announcement about the dangers of thalidomide, and the hospital refused to allow an abortion, apparently because of her announcement and its own fear of publicity. Chessen traveled to Sweden for the abortion. Upon completion, it was confirmed that the fetus had no legs and only one arm. The incident became a made-for-TV movie in 1992, \"A Private Matter\", with Sissy Spacek as Chessen.\n\nAfter the children's television watchdog group Action for Children's Television was organized in 1968, the group's first target was Boston's version of \"Romper Room\" at WHDH-TV, which at the time focused on the promotion of its branded line of toys to its viewers. Threatened with referral to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), WHDH scaled back the host's role in pitching the program's products (\"host-selling\").\n\nThrough the 1980s, Hasbro (which had purchased the program in 1969) sold branded \"Romper Room\" toys and products, but since ACT's intervention, ads and promotions for the items were not seen in the \"Romper Room\" program.\n\nThe \"Romper Room\" format was expanded into other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\n\nSeveral stations in Australia aired their own versions of Romper Room, most notably the Seven Network (who produced a national version through its Sydney station ATN-7) and regional station NBN-3 Newcastle.\n\nThe hostesses of the national edition were Miss Susan (Susan Jamieson), Miss Patricia (Patricia Godfrey-Cash), Miss Colleen, Miss Helena (Helena Bailey), Miss Nancy, and Miss Megan (Megan Sjoquist). This version of \"Romper Room\" was axed in 1988 as the children's show \"Fat Cat and Friends\" replaced it.\n\nThe NBN edition continued after the station became an affiliate of the Nine Network, with a new title, \"Big Dog and Friends\", in 1997 the title referring to the station's mascot Big Dog, who appeared in the show as the sidekick of the hostess, Miss Kim (Kim Anthony). This was renamed due to NBN's rights with Claster Television for using the \"Romper Room\" name, songs and characters expiring in the end of 1996. This, the last version of \"Romper Room\" to survive on Australian television, was eventually cancelled in 1999 after Kim Anthony decided to retire from hosting the show.\n\nOther stations known to have produced their own versions of Romper Room are SAS-10 (now SAS-7) Adelaide, which ran from 1965 to 1974, and ATV-0 (now ATV-10) Melbourne.\n\nMTN9 Griffith, NSW, also ran a live version with Anna Pistillo (known as Miss Anne) between 1967 - 1968. \nAnna was trained in Sydney by Miss Pat, produced and presented the programme locally with the support of station Manager, Norm Murphy.\nUnfortunately, all archival footage has since been destroyed but 8mm behind the scenes footage does exist.\nIt is rumored Miss Anne was the progeny for the naming of Humphrey the Bear.\n\nIn Canada, the first station to start airing the locally produced version of \"Romper Room\" was CKLW-TV in Windsor, Ontario, which at the time was serving the Detroit, Michigan television market, in 1960, with Miss Flora, Flora (Paulin) Asselstine. Besides Windsor, CJCH-TV in Halifax, Nova Scotia also produced a local version during the 1960s, which was hosted by \"Miss Jo-Anne\" (Jo-Anne Lawson). This version later moved to CHSJ-TV in Saint John, New Brunswick during the 1970s. Other local versions were produced at CFPL-TV in London, Ontario CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, BC, hosted by \"Miss Betty\" (Betty Pavle), CJAY-TV in Winnipeg, CKVR-TV in Barrie, Ontario hosted by \"Miss Lois\" (Lois Welsman), CKSO-TV in Sudbury, Ontario hosted by \"Miss Pat\" (Patricia Wilson), CHEX-TV in Peterborough, Ontario hosted by \"Miss Kelly\" (Kelly Richardson) and CFCF-TV in Montreal. In Newfoundland and Labrador, a local version was produced on CJON-TV (NTV) in St. John's, and there was another local version produced in Grand Falls-Windsor. The version in Toronto aired on CFTO-TV.\n\nCKCO-TV in Kitchener, Ontario also had a local version, starting in 1963. In 1972 this version became nationwide running until 1992 on CTV and was hosted by \"Miss Fran\" (Fran Pappert), \"Miss Jean\" (Jeanette Moffat), \"Miss Cathie\" (Cathie Sackville) and \"Miss Betty\" (Betty Thompson). The Canadian version of the program used the same opening credits and \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" theme as the US version, the Jack-in-the-box logo, and other elements such as the Do-Bee character and the Magic Mirror (including the psychedelic visual effect that went along with it). When the US franchise changed the title to \"Romper Room and Friends\", the Canadian series followed suit. When the Canadian version ended production in 1992, it was the last version in production anywhere.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there was a local version called Siusiu Lokyuen (小小樂園), which aired from the late 1960s to the early 1970s on Asia Television's Chinese channel (now ATV Home). It was hosted by Miss Chiu Suk-ching (趙淑貞) but she would be known as \"Sister Chiu\" (趙淑貞姐姐). Elements such as \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" theme, the Jack-in-the-box logo, the Do-Bee character and the Magic Mirror are the same as other versions.\n\nIn Japan, there was a localised version called , which aired from 1963 to 1979 on NTV. Just before this show debuted, the first Japanese hostess, Midori Namiki, visited New York for training with other hostesses from several countries.\n\nHostesses of the Japanese version were always named Miss Midori, with the common Japanese given name, \"midori\", meaning \"green\".\n\nThe Japanese version had a controversial episode, when hostess Midori Utsumi (the second \"Miss Midori\") asked the kids, \"Who can tell me a word that begins with \"ki\"?\" (き or キ). A boy answered: \"I know: \"Kintama\"!\"—a slang term for \"testicles\" that is roughly equivalent to \"balls\" or \"nuts\" in English. Hoping to give the boy a gentle little hint, Miss Midori suggested: \"Maybe you could think of something that sounds a bit more \"kireina\"?\" (with careful emphasis on the \"ki\" portion of this word), which means \"nice\" or \"pretty\". The boy immediately responded, \"\"Kireina kintama\"!\"—i.e., \"Nice nuts!\". After a commercial break, the boy was replaced with a teddy bear. Midori Utsumi, who has since become a major media personality, sometimes tells this story during television appearances.\n\nIn New Zealand, a local version of \"Romper Room\" aired on South Pacific Television from 1975 until 1980, when the channel became part of Television New Zealand. Among the presenters were Miss Yvonne (Yvonne Moore), the wife of Mike Moore who served briefly as prime minister in 1990.\n\nOnly one attempt was made to export the program to a South American market, in 1988. The first host was Alicia Gomez-Trauchtenberg (Sra. Alicia), who was fired after nine days when it was found out that she had been a member of a secret Ascuncion chapter of a pro-Nazi group. After a tenth day featuring an (unnamed) accordion player who played thirty minutes of spirituals on an accordion, a replacement was found - Juana Corazon (Sra Juanita). She was fired after seven days after it was discovered that she had acted in at least two pornographic films. \"Romper Room\" was promptly canceled, and no other attempts were made to further the series in Ascuncion or any other South American market.\n\nThe United Kingdom had several versions of \"Romper Room\".\n\nAnglia Television produced a version for broadcast in the East Anglia region of England from 1964 to 1976, hosted by \"Miss Rosalyn\" (Rosalyn Thompson).\n\nIn Northern Ireland, local ITV company UTV created a local production in the late 1960s and early 1970s, hosted by \"Miss Adrienne\" (mother of television reporter Andrea Catherwood), and then \"Miss Helen\", and Rose Neill as \"Miss Rose\".\n\nAround the same time, Grampian Television in northern Scotland produced a version hosted by \"Miss Lesley\" (Lesley Blair, a continuity announcer) and \"Miss Rose Neill\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2021016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021016", "title": "Suicide pact", "text": "Suicide pact\n\nA suicide pact is an agreed plan between two or more individuals to commit suicide. The plan may be to die together, or separately and closely timed.\n\nSuicide pacts are an important concept in the study of suicide, and have occurred throughout history, as well as in fiction. An example of this is the suicide pact between Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria and Baroness Mary Vetsera.\n\nSuicide pacts are sometimes contrasted with mass suicides, understood as incidents in which a larger number of people kill themselves together for the same ideological reason, often within a religious, political, military or paramilitary context. \"Suicide pact\" tends to connote small groups and non-ideological motivations, as do bonding as married or romantic partners, as family members or friends, or even as criminal partners.\nIn England and Wales, suicide pact is a partial defense, under section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957, which reduces murder to manslaughter. In Northern Ireland, this defense is created by section 14 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 (c. 20) (N.I.).\n\nOne of the first internet suicides in Israel occurred in 1997, when Eran Aderet, a 19-year-old soldier, died after expressing his desire to commit suicide online, and received detailed instructions on how to accomplish this with an M16 rifle in his possession. Following this case, in 1999, a new Israeli association, SAHAR, sought to prevent suicide by providing supportive conversations and referrals to relevant resources. In 2005, following an increase in the number of internet suicide cases, the police established a special unit which consists of six policemen and specializes in helping people who confess online to wanting to commit suicide. The unit keeps in contact with forum moderators, who are asked to look out for posts from suicidal users. About 200 cases are detected each year, preventing dozens of suicides.\n\nFollowing the success of the Israeli model, similar units have been founded in Sweden, Germany and France.\n\nAlthough the majority of such internet-related suicide pacts have occurred in Japan (where it takes the name of \"netto shinjū,\" ネット心中), similar incidents have also been reported from other countries including China, South Korea, Germany, Australia, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and Sweden.\n\nThe first known Internet-related suicide pact occurred in Japan in October 2000, with a later February 2003 incident, involving a young man and two young women, that \"became a landmark incident of Internet suicide pacts in Japan due to heavy media coverage\".\n\nDespite the alarmed response of the media, Internet-connected suicide pacts are still relatively rare. Even in Japan, where most of such pacts have occurred, they still represent only 2% of all group suicide-pacts, and less than 0.01% of all suicides combined. However, they have been increasing in the country: 34 deaths from such pacts occurred in 2003; at least 50 are estimated to have occurred in 2004; and 91 deaths occurred in 2005. One notable example would be Hiroshi Maeue, who on March 28, 2007, was sentenced to death by hanging, alleged to have murdered three participants in a suicide pact.\n\nAn article published in the \"British Medical Journal\" in December 2004, by a Dr Sundararajan Rajagopal, Consultant Psychiatrist from St. Thomas' Hospital in London, highlighted the emergence of the relatively new phenomenon of cybersuicide pacts, addressing it from a psychiatric perspective. Dr Rajagopal commented \"The recent suicide pacts in Japan might just be isolated events in a country that has even previously been shown to have the highest rate of suicide pacts. Alternatively, they might herald a new disturbing trend in suicide pacts, with more such incidents, involving strangers meeting over the Internet, becoming increasingly common. If the latter is the case then the epidemiology of suicide pacts is likely to change, with more young people living on their own, who may have committed suicide alone, joining with like-minded suicidal persons to die together\".\n\nAn article published by the \"Canterbury Suicide Project\" makes some notable comparisons between the nature of \"traditional\" suicide pacts and more recent Internet-related suicide pacts (or, as described in the article, \"cyber-based suicide pacts\"). It points out that traditionally suicide pacts:\nOn the other hand, the growing number of Internet-related suicide pacts are almost the exact opposite: \nThe article also points out that the trend of Internet-related suicide pacts is changing the way that mental-health workers need to deal with depressed and/or suicidal young people, advising that it is \"prudent for clinicians to ask routinely if young people have been accessing Internet sites, obtaining suicide information from such sites, and talking in suicide chat rooms\".\n\nPerson who enters into an internet suicide pact can be also lying intentionally. William Francis Melchert-Dinkel is an example of a person who made multiple internet suicide pacts, in which he falsely promised to hang himself after the other person died by suicide. Melchert-Dinkel was later convicted of criminally assisting or attempting to assist in two suicides by providing detailed information about a suicide method.\n\n\n"}

The award \"was created as a counterpoint to the Newbery\" in order to highlight the best and most literary works of excellence written for a young adult audience. \n\nJonathon Hunt, a \"Horn Book\" reviewer, hopes that the Printz Award can create a \"canon as revered as that of the Newbery.\" \n\nMichael L. Printz was a librarian at Topeka West High School in Topeka, Kansas, until he retired in 1994. He was also an active member of YALSA, serving on the Best Books for Young Adults Committee and the Margaret A. Edwards Award Committee. He dedicated his life to ensuring that his students had access to good literature. To that end he encouraged writers to focus on the young adult audience. He created an author-in-residence program at the high school to promote new talent and encourage his students. His most noteworthy find was Chris Crutcher.

He has also produced television series and documentaries for HBO.\n\nRich is currently writer-at-large for \"New York\" magazine, where he writes essays on politics and culture and engages in regular dialogues on news of the week for the \"Daily Intelligencer\". He served as executive producer of the long-running HBO comedy series \"Veep\", having joined the show at its outset in 2011, and of the HBO drama series \"Succession\".\n\nRich grew up in Washington, D.C. His mother, Helene Fisher (née Aaronson), a schoolteacher and artist, was from a Russian Jewish family that originally settled in Brooklyn, New York, but moved to Washington after the stock market crash of 1929. His father, Frank Hart Rich, a businessman, was from a German Jewish family long-settled in Washington. He attended public schools and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1967.\n\nRich attended Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At Harvard, he became the editorial chairman of \"The Harvard Crimson\", the university's daily student newspaper. Rich was an honorary Harvard College scholar and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and received a Henry Russell Shaw Traveling Fellowship. He graduated in 1971 with an A.B. \"magna cum laude\" in American history and literature.\n\nBefore joining \"The New York Times\" in 1980, Rich was a film and television critic for \"Time\", a film critic for \"The New York Post\", and film critic and senior editor of \"New Times Magazine\". In the early 1970s, he was a founding editor of the \"Richmond (Va.) Mercury\".\n\nRich served as chief theater critic of \"The New York Times\" from 1980 to 1993, earning the nickname \"Butcher of Broadway\" for his power over the prospects of Broadway shows. He first won attention from theater-goers with an essay for \"The Harvard Crimson\" about the Broadway musical \"Follies\" (1971), by Stephen Sondheim, during its pre-Broadway tryout run in Boston. In his study of the work, Rich was \"the first person to predict the legendary status the show eventually would achieve\". The article \"fascinated\" Harold Prince, the musical's co-director, and \"absolutely intrigued\" Sondheim, who invited the undergraduate to lunch to further discuss his feelings about the production.\n\nIn a retrospective article for \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"Exit the Critic,\" published in 1994, Rich reflected on the controversies during his tenure as drama critic as well as on the playwrights he championed and on the tragedies that decimated the New York theater during the height of the AIDS crisis. A collection of Rich's theater reviews was published in a book, \"Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for \"The New York Times\", 1980–1993\" (1998). He also wrote \"The Theatre Art of Boris Aronson\", with Lisa Aronson, in 1987.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2011, Rich was an op-ed columnist for \"The New York Times\"; he wrote regularly on the connections between mass media and American politics. His columns, now appearing in \"New York Magazine\", make regular references to a broad range of popular culture—including television, movies, theater and literature. In addition to his long-time work for the \"Times\" and \"New York\", Rich has written for many other publications, including \"The New York Review of Books\".\n\nThe commentator Bill O'Reilly, host of the Fox News Channel talk show \"The O'Reilly Factor\", criticized Rich following Rich's criticism of Fox in 2004 as having a politically conservative bias.\n\nRich also attracted controversy by dismissing the historical-drama film \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004), directed by Mel Gibson, as \"nothing so much as a porn movie, replete with slo-mo climaxes and pounding music for the money shots.\"\n\nIn a January 2006 appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", commenting on the James Frey memoir scandal, Rich expanded on his usage in his column of the term \"truthiness\" to summarize a variety of ills in culture and politics. His book, \"The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to Katrina\" (2006), criticized the American media for what he perceived as its support of George W. Bush's administration's propaganda following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and during the run-up to the Iraq war.\n\nA July 2009 column focused on what Rich believes is the bigoted nature of President Barack Obama's detractors. On the Tea Party movement, which emerged in 2009, Rich opined that at one of their rallies they were \"kowtowing to secessionists.\" He wrote that death threats and a brick thrown through a congressman's window were a \"small-scale mimicry of \"Kristallnacht\" (or \"night of broken glass\", the November 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany and Austria). In his essays at \"New York\", Rich has continued to examine the American right, including its latest revival during the candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nSince 2008, Rich has been a creative consultant for HBO, where he helps initiate and develop new programming and is an Executive Producer of \"Veep\", the long-running comedy series created by Armando Iannucci and starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus. He is also an Executive Producer of \"Succession\", the HBO drama series created by Jesse Armstrong that debuted in June of 2018 to critical praise.\n\nRich was also an Executive Producer for the HBO documentaries \"Six by Sondheim\" (2013), directed by James Lapine, and \"Becoming Mike Nichols\" (2016), directed by Douglas McGrath.\n\nRich's journalistic honors include the George Polk Award for commentary in 2005 and, in 2011, the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from Harvard University. In 2016, he received the Mirror Award for Best Commentary from the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. He was inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame in 2015. Rich was twice a Pulitzer Prize finalist, in 1987 and 2005.\n\nRich received Emmy Awards in 2015, 2016, and 2017 for \"Veep\", which was named Outstanding Comedy Series. He has won two Peabody Awards, for \"Veep\" in 2017, and, in 2013, for \"Six by Sondheim\", which was also honored with the ASCAP Deems Taylor Television Broadcast Award.\n\nIn 2011, Rich was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from The New School.\n\nIn 2011, \"The New Republic\" included him along with Rachel Maddow and Ayn Rand as one of the \"Most Over-Rated Thinkers\" of the year, calling him \"an utterly conventional pundit of the old salon liberal variety\".\n\nRich lives in Manhattan with his wife, the author and journalist Alex Witchel, whom he married in 1991.

{"id": "2021048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021048", "title": "Limerick lace", "text": "Limerick lace\n\nLimerick lace is a specific class of lace originating in Limerick, Ireland, which was later produced throughout the country. It evolved from the invention of a machine which made net in 1808. Until John Heathcoat invented a net-making machine in Devon in 1815, handmade net was a very expensive fabric. This meant cheap net became available to Irish lacemakers, particularly after 1823 when Heathcoat's patent expired.\n\nLimerick lace is a hybrid lace of embroidered needle lace or crocheted lace on a machine made net base. It is a 'mixed lace' rather than a ‘true lace’, which would be entirely hand made. Limerick lace comes in two forms: tambour lace, which is made by stretching a net over a frame like a tambourine and drawing threads through it with a hook, and needlerun lace, which is made by using a needle to embroider on a net background.\n\nThe lace was noted for its variety of delicate fillings, as many as 47 different ones being found in one collar.\n\nThe Limerick lace industry was founded in 1829 by Charles Walker, a native of Oxfordshire.\n\nThe history of Limerick lace can be divided into two broad periods: the age of factory production 1829-c.1870 and the age of home and workshop production c.1870-1914.\n\nIn 1829, Walker brought over 24 girls to teach lace-making in Limerick, drawn to the area by the availability of cheap, skilled female labour, and his business thrived. Charles Walker chose Limerick after touring various sites for the business. Limerick previously had a thriving Limerick glove industry, but at this time had a large population of unemployed women with a tradition of factory work. Limerick lace was produced mainly in factories for the first forty years of its existence. Between the 1830s and 1860s, several lace factories operated in Limerick. The city’s second lace factory was established in 1835 by William Lloyd, initially at Clare Street and later in Abbey Court off Nicholas Street. In 1841, there were 400 women and girls working for him. In 1836, Leycester Greaves (1809-47), a Cork man opened a factory in Limerick. These lace factories employed almost 2,000 women and girls.\n\nIn the 1840s, Limerick lace making was introduced to a number of convents and convent-run institutions, both in Limerick and elsewhere. In 1850, lace making was introduced to the Good Shepherd Convent on Clare Street Limerick, but it was also made in other religious houses based in the city, including the Presentation Convent in Sexton Street and the Mercy Convent at Mount Saint Vincent, on O’Connell Avenue. Limerick lace was disseminated widely throughout Ireland by Catholic religious sisters, anxious to provide employment at the time of the Famine. They introduced it to several other convents, including religious houses in Youghal, Kinsale, Dunmore East, Cahirciveen, and Kenmare. At the Good Shepherd Convent, the last lace making centre in Limerick, production ceased in 1990.\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, the Limerick lace industry declined rapidly, due to the market being flooded by entirely machine made lace from chiefly from Nottingham. One reason for this period of decline was the realisation that design was necessary for beautiful lace. Following the Cork Industrial Exhibition of 1883, the President of Queen's College, Cork, wrote, \"... only well-designed and finely executed lace [that] can hold its ground against machine lace.\"\n\nIt was revived in the 1880s due to the work of Florence Vere O'Brien (1858-1936) who established a Lace School in Limerick, which opened with eight pupils in May 1889. This ran until 1922. Another important promoter of Limerick lace during this period was Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Countess of Aberdeen (1847-1939) who established the Irish Industries Association in 1886 to encourage the 'Buy Irish' movement. This was integral to reviving Limerick lace as a traditional craft.\n\nIn 1904, Mrs Maude Kearney (1873-1963), a daughter of James Hodkinson, founder of the famous firm of specialists in church decoration in Henry Street, Limerick, established a lace making business which she called the Thomond Lace Industry. Based in Thomondgate, Thomond Lace employed between fifty and eighty workers at the height of its success. After the Second World War, Limerick lace declined rapidly.\n\nThose who are known to have worn Limerick lace were Queen Victoria, Edith Roosevelt and Countess Markievicz. When John F. Kennedy visited Limerick in 1963 he was presented with a lace christening robe. This christening robe was created in the Good Shepherd Convent, Clare Street, Limerick. Generations of churchmen also wore Limerick lace and used lace to decorate their churches.\n\nLimerick Museum holds the largest collection of Limerick lace in the country. A collection is also held in the Sisters of Mercy in Charleville, Co.

He was a founding member of the Society of the United Irishmen.\n\nHenry Joy McCracken was born in High street, Belfast into two of the city's most prominent Presbyterian industrial families. He was the son of a shipowner, Captain John McCracken and Ann Joy, daughter of Francis Joy, of French Huguenot descent. The Joy family made their money in linen manufacture and founded the \"Belfast News Letter\". \nHenry was the older brother of political activist and social reformer Mary Ann McCracken, with whom he shared an interest in Irish traditional culture.\n\nIn 1792, he helped organise the Belfast Harp Festival which gathered aged harpists from around Ireland, and helped preserve the Irish airs by having them transcribed by Edward Bunting.\nBunting, who lodged in the McCracken's Rosemary Lane home, was a classically trained musician.\n\nMcCracken became interested in republican politics from an early age and along with other Protestants formed the Society of the United Irishmen in 1795 which quickly made him a target of the authorities. \nHe regularly travelled throughout the country using his business as a cover for organising other United Irish societies, but was arrested in October 1796 and lodged in Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin. \nWhile imprisoned with other leaders of the United Irishmen, McCracken fell seriously ill and was released on bail in December 1797.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the United Irishmen-led Rebellion in Leinster in May 1798, the Antrim organisation met on 3 June to decide on their response. The meeting ended inconclusively with a vote to wait for French aid being passed by a narrow margin. A new meeting of delegates was held in Templepatrick on 5 June where McCracken was elected general for Antrim and he quickly began planning military operations.\n\nMcCracken formulated a plan for all small towns in Antrim to be seized after which rebels would converge upon Antrim town on 7 June where the county's magistrates were to hold a crisis meeting. Although the plan met initial success and McCracken led the rebels in the attack on Antrim, the Catholic Defenders group whom McCracken expected assistance from were conspicuous by their absence. The mainly Irish Presbyterian rebels led by McCracken were defeated by the English forces and his army melted away.\n\nAlthough McCracken initially escaped with James Hope, James Orr, and James Dickey and was supported in his month long period of hiding by his sister Mary Ann, a chance encounter with men who recognized him from his cotton business led to his arrest. He was offered clemency if he testified against other United Irishmen leaders, McCracken refused to turn on his compatriots.\n\nHe was court-martialled and hanged at Corn Market, Belfast, on land his grandfather had donated to the city, on 17 July 1798, aged 30. According to historian Guy Beiner, his corpse was spared the indignity of decapitation in order not to provoke renewed agitation. He was buried in the Parish Church of St George in Belfast, but a few years later the grave was demolished.\n\nMcCracken's remains are believed to have been reinterred by Francis Joseph Bigger in 1909 at Clifton Street Cemetery, Belfast, alongside his sister Mary Ann. His illegitimate daughter Maria (whose mother is speculated to have been Mary Bodell), was raised by her aunt Mary Ann McCracken.\n\n"}

It is the home ground of League of Ireland team Derry City F.C. and (temporarily) NIFL Premiership team Institute\n\nThe football team play on Friday evenings usually at 7.45pm; the greyhound racing takes place on Monday evenings and occasionally on Thursday evenings.\n\nUntil September 2018, the stadium was known as the Brandywell Stadium before it was renamed to honour Ryan McBride.\n\nThe stadium is situated on the Lone Moor Road just south-west of the Bogside in the Brandywell area and shares the road with another sports-ground, Celtic Park, the headquarters of the Derry GAA. The ground, which is within walking distance of the city centre, is more commonly referred to as simply, the 'Brandywell', and is the home of Derry City FC.\n\nPreviously it was the home of St Columb's Court and Derry Celtic. The ground, as well as the stadium, features a large grass training area, a club shop, a club house, from which the club and ticket offices operate, and parking space for cars and coaches. The legal owner of the stadium is the Derry City Council, however, which, under licence, permits Derry City to make use of the grounds for training matches and the running of its various other club affairs, such as administration and the retail outlet.\n\nPlans of Derry City's to purchase a pitch fell through after their formation due to the tight timescale between their birth in 1928 and the season's beginning in 1929 and so the Londonderry Corporation (now known as the Derry City Council) was approached for the use of the Brandywell Stadium which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. This began an association between the club and the ground which has survived until the present day. The club are still operating under the constraints of the Honourable the Irish Society charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club do not have private ownership over the ground and, thus, cannot develop it by their own accord with that discretion being left to the Derry City Council. \n\nDerry City's first game at the Brandywell was against Glentoran on 22 August 1929. The stadium has played host to many notable matches, such as Derry City's 1–0 victory IFK Göteborg on 27 July 2006 in the UEFA Cup first qualifying round. However, current facilities for spectators and media simply cannot cope with the demand for some matches. The ground also hosted the FAI League Cup final in 2006 between Derry City and Dublin rivals, Shelbourne FC. Derry won the dramatic game after it went to a penalty shoot-out.\n\nThe dimensions of the pitch itself measure 111 yards in length by 72 yards in width. Due to health and safety regulations the stadium has a seating capacity of 2,900 for European football competitions run by UEFA, although it can accommodate 8,200 on a normal domestic match-day including those both standing and seated.\n\nFor a period of 14 years, between 1971 and 1985 only greyhound meetings and junior football were held at the venue as both the police and the Irish League imposed a ban on Derry City using the stadium as their home ground due to the Troubles. Derry City used the Coleraine Showgrounds instead for a number of 'home' ties in the 1971–72 season. While the police ruled the Brandywell was safe to use for the 1972–73 season, a league vote to allow Derry to return to the ground failed by one vote. A number of opposing teams, especially those with unionist support, were reluctant to travel through the area surrounding the stadium due to the Troubles. Faced with an unsustainable arrangement and dwindling finances, Derry the Irish League entirely in October 1972 due to the unsustainability of such an arrangement. 1985 saw Derry admitted into the Republic's league, the League of Ireland, and a much-welcomed return of senior football to the ground.\n\nUnusually, The Brandywell do not usually have a police presence inside it during Derry City games however the PSNI do have the ability to enter the stadium in an emergency.\n\nThe Brandywell Stadium also hosts the final games of the Foyle Cup tournament.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was voted the tenth favourite sporting venue in the UK by BBC's Radio Five Live.\n\nThe Brandywell has undergone large-scale redevelopment is recent years with the curved cantilever 'New Stand' being constructed in 1991 and the terraced 'Jungle' being demolished in 2004. The 'Jungle' section was the home of Derry's noisier hardcore element of fans. Many of these fanatics now occupy the area of and surrounding Block J in the 'New Stand'. The quieter blocks of the 'New Stand', where the remainder of the more-reserved spectators sit, are sometimes referred to as the 'Library' in jest by the louder group.\n\nFurthermore, the stadium saw the construction of 450 extra seats opposite the 'New Stand' on the site of the old 'Jungle' to complement the pre-existing small Glentoran Stand (the old main stand; an elevated wooden structure with bench seating) on that side of the ground, as well as the development of a drug-testing facility, in August 2006 in order to cope with the demand for Derry's UEFA Cup second qualifying round tie with Gretna FC. Although the remainder of available space around the pitch and racing track is used as a terrace, development is set to continue with the building of the proposed Brandywell Complex. On behalf of the club, Brandywell Properties' plans for the complex include an 8,000 all-seater stadium (which will be expandable), new playing and training pitches, an indoor football complex, retail units, a medical centre and a pharmacy. There are, however, no plans under the current proposals, to include a dog-racing track. The cost of this development, which is aimed to be completed by 2012, is reportedly £12 million. Work on the new complex was planned to begin by Spring 2007. The need for new stadium facilities became prominent with the old side of the stadium becoming noticeably more run-down by the season. However, as legal owners of the land, Derry City Council ultimately holds the key to the proceeding of any planned development.\n\nWhile an alternative idea of building a new multi-purpose stadium for the city (which would also provide a new home for Derry City FC) on the site of a dismantled British Army post at the city's Fort George, or even a move to a re-developed Templemore Sports Complex, has also been aired due to delays in the process, on 12 January 2007, financial advisor and former Gaelic Athletic Association president, Peter Quinn, who played a pivotal role in securing funding for the re-development of the modern-day Croke Park, was appointed as a consultant by Brandywell Properties to spearhead the club's bid to take over the re-development of the Brandywell Stadium and help the plan progress. On behalf of Brandywell Properties he is to seek funding from both the Irish and British governments, as well as injections from the National Lottery along with sums from other sporting agencies in order to help raise the £12 million needed. The proposals will eventually be submitted to the Government, as well to the city council.\n\nOn 19 February 2007, the chairman of Brandywell Properties, Jack McCauley, a former chairman of Derry City, re-iterated the intention of focusing on the Brandywell Stadium for re-development and made it clear that the club's traditional and spiritual home at the Brandywell was \"the only show in town\" as far as the football club was concerned. He also expressed how he was \"amazed and surprised\" that options such as the Templemore Sports Complex and Fort George were actually talked of being available.\n\nDetails of a state-of-the-art stand on the Lone Moor Road side of the ground were announced in October 2009. Then Derry City chairman Pat McDaid said he hoped the work would be completed by 2012. The need for repair was highlighted by the club's return to European competition that year.\n\nIn 2010, Ostick + Williams was appointed by Derry City Council to carry out redevelopment of the stadium to bring it into line with modern safety standards. Included in their brief was compliance with UEFA Category 2 and 3 standard to allow for European games to be played there. The planned facilities include a new 2,600 seat stand, bringing seating capacity up to 5,100, as well as new facilities for players, media and spectators. An Artificial turf will be laid, and the greyhound racing facilities will also be updated. The track and football pitch will be at separate locations within the showgrounds. Spectator access to the ground will be improved, segregation will be possible for crowd control when necessary, and there will also be the ability to stage concerts and other events at the stadium. A sports centre at Brandywell will be demolished as part of the redevelopment plan.\n\nIt was initially hoped that work would commence in 2011. The stated cost of work was £5 million. Funding was expected to come from Stormont, as a deal agreed between Linfield and the Irish Football Association for them to use Windsor Park for national team matches freed up funds. The urgency of funding was exacerbated by essential safety works. A share of £31 million was made available. Concerns that the club doesn't play in the Northern Ireland Football League and should not have access to government funding were dismissed by Derry City chairman Philip O'Doherty. He said the club pays tax and should be entitled to the same facilities as any Belfast club.\n\nDerry City Council, owners of the stadium, agreed in principle in December 2013 to spend £2.7 million on its redevelopment. In 2015, Mr O'Doherty blamed a council consultation project for the delay in redevelopment, which had already seen part of the Glentoran stand torn down. That stand was one of the oldest structures in the Irish Football League, and originally stood at the Oval football ground in Belfast, hence its name. The stadium was purchased, disassembled and reconstructed at Brandywell in the 1940s. Work was delayed by a further year, potentially scuppering plans to have Celtic F.C. formally open the new stadium.\n\nIn January 2016, the club announced the new stadium would be built ready for the 2017 season, and that work would start in July. On 5 July 2016, Derry City and Strabane District Council advised they were in the final stages of a procurement process for the Brandywell stadium. Two months later, the final stages were still in progress. As the 2016 season came to a close, club chairman Philip O'Doherty said that European football at Brandywell was under threat due to an as yet unknown start date for the redevelopment. On 19 October, Derry City and Strabane District Council stated the appointment of a contractor was ongoing. Derry City qualified for the Europa League for the 2017/18 season. Work finally commenced in December 2016 on the new 3G pitch and all-seated stand, which should be completed in time for the start of the 2018 season. All home games in 2017 were played at Maginn Park.\n\n\nDuring games, Derry City's fans can often be heard singing:\nWe all live in the randy Brandywell,<br> The randy Brandywell, <br> The randy Brandywell.<br>\n\nThe original track around the stadium existed from 1932 until 2016. In 2018 a new stand alone track was opened.\n\n\"\"Tobar an Fhíoruisce\"\" translates literally into English as \"the well of pure water\".\n\n"}

The \"ethereal\" quality of instruments such as the glass harmonica exemplified the \"Empfindsamkeit\" and for a while, \"the instrument was extraordinarily popular...[but] About 1830 the instrument fell into oblivion.\"\n\nThe glasschord (or glasscord) resembles the celesta (a struck plaque idiophone operated by a keyboard) but uses keyboard-driven hammers to strike glass bars instead of metal bars.\n\nThe glass marimba is similar to the marimba (a stick percussion instrument with a keyboard layout), but has bars of glass instead of wood. The bars, which the performer strikes with padded sticks, are perched on a glass box to provide the necessary resonance.\n\nA rare Thai instrument called \"ranat kaeo\" (ระนาดแก้ว; literally \"glass xylophone\") has been used by the Thai music ensemble Fong Naam; it appears on their 1992 CD \"The Sleeping Angel: Thai Classical Music\".\n\nIn Lydia Syson's biography, \"Doctor of Love: James Graham and his Celestial Bed\" (), sexologist James Graham uses the glass harmonica for musical therapy purposes.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was inspired to create his glass harmonica in 1763 after attending a recital performed on musical glasses in London in 1761.\n\n\n"}

He was the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1971 to 1981 and the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong from 1981 to 1985. During his tenure of Financial Secretary, he famously coined the term \"positive non-interventionism\" as its chief principle, which has long-lasting effect on Hong Kong and world's economic philosophy.\n\nHaddon-Cave was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia with his brother David and sister Pamela. He was educated at the University of Tasmania and King's College, Cambridge. He joined the British Colonial Service in 1952 was assigned to Kenya, British East Africa. In 1961, he was appointed Financial Secretary in the Seychelles in 1961. In 1963, he was transferred to work in the Hong Kong government, working in the Department of Trade and Industry. In 1965, he became the Director of Trade and Industry and was promoted Deputy Secretary of Economy. In 1969, he was appointed Deputy Financial Secretary.\n\nHe became the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong in 1971, succeeding Sir John Cowperthwaite. Contrast to his predecessor, he was known to be willing to discuss budgetary and monetary policies. He recognised a broader responsibility for the government in economy. He noted that the Hong Kong government's attitude to the economy \"is frequently but inadequately described as laissez-faire.\" He preferred to describe its stance as one of the \"positive non-interventionism\" in his Budget Speech in 1980, in which the government should not \"plan the allocation of resources available to the private sector and to frustrate the operation of market forces\", the private sector should accept and bear the costs of its own mistake; and the government had certain specific obligations. First it recognised its budgetary and fiscal policies would affect the entire economy and that it had a responsibility to intervene in a limited fashion. Second the government should be prepared to exercise guidance and impose restraints on banking and securities. Third, it was responsible for establishing advisory bodies where private interest could be maximised and public interest secured. Fourth, the government should provide law and order, defence, preventative health measures, fire services, sanitation and a basic network of roads and drainage and fund the services of housing, education, medical and health services and social welfare.\n\nIn 1972, the Hong Kong dollar slumped to the bottom of its band against the US dollar but Hong Kong did not have US dollar reserves to defend the rate. The government was forced to sell sterling for US dollars to then buy Hong Kong dollar to support the rate. In July 1973, the Hong Kong dollar was dragged down against sterling due to the continued devaluation of the US dollar as a result of the outflow of capital from Hong Kong. In August 1973, Governor Murray MacLehose and Haddon-Cave attempted to end the historic commitment to sterling reserves but the idea was rejected by London. The British government offered a unilateral agreement in return to guarantee sterling balances at a new slightly higher rate. In July 1974 the price of US$1 fell below HK$5.05 which force Haddon-Cave to announce the Hong Kong dollar to float free from its link to the US dollar on 27 November. However, the floating exchange caused the serious problem of inflation in the 1970s in an annual rate of 9.5%. He followed Cowperthwaite line to insist the colony did not need active monetary policies because of the economy's automatic adjustment mechanism although he later came close to admit that the era of automatic adjustment was over.\n\nDuring his tenure of Financial Secretary, Haddon-Cave was concerned about the massive growth of government spending under MacLehose administration. The government projected a three years substantial government deficits, in which Haddon-Cave described as \"clearly quite unacceptable\". He proposed several tax reforms to increase the government income and change the lack of progressivity in the system. In his 1973 Budget Speech, Haddon-Cave announced his intention to \"restore\" the profits tax as he deemed that \"Court decisions have shown that a business Hong Kong doing exactly what it was set up to do in Hong Kong and nowhere else can have business income derived from outside Hong Kong, coming from no conduct of business outside Hong Kong, and escaping charge.\" He repeated his intention in the 1974 and 1975 Budget Speeches although no policies were implemented, which was thought to face the opposition from the business interests.\n\nHaddon-Cave also proposed tax on dividends, following Cowperthwaite had proposed a decade earlier. A Third Inland Revenue Ordinance Review Committee was set up to investigate over the matter in 1976. Although Haddon-Cave endorsed the Report to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Committee's proposal to tax dividends was eventually abandoned, due to the opposition of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council. Only the recommendation of increased rate of profits tax for corporations was adopted, which left the geographical scope of profits tax remained narrow.\n\nFor his services, he was awarded Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1973 and knighted with the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1980.\n\nHaddon-Cave was appointed Chief Secretary of Hong Kong in 1981. In his tenure, he oversaw the massive district administration reform under the District Administration Scheme. He helped establishing the District Boards and the first District Board elections in 1982 and the second elections in 1985. He also oversaw the establishment of the Provisional Regional Council. He also witnessed the Sino-British negotiations on the Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visit to Beijing in September 1983 and the finalisation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December 1984. As Chief Secretary, he also acted as Governor of Hong Kong on several occasions.\n\nHe retired from public service in 1985. After leaving Hong Kong, he spent his retirement quietly in England. He died of heart attack while in a taxi near his retirement home in Oxford, England on 27 September 1999. He married Elizabeth Alice Simpson in 1948; she designed many of Hong Kong's commemorative coins, including the reverses of the \"Return to China\" set of 1997. The couple had two sons and one daughter. His youngest son Sir Charles Anthony was appointed to the High Court in 2011. Many of Haddon-Cave's family and relatives still live in Hong Kong, including younger son Francis who was called to the bar in 1999. He was also the grandfather of actress Jessie Cave, Sydney-based artist and property investor Ismay Haddon-Cave and television producer, Ali Haddon-Cave.,\n\nDespite his long years of service in Hong Kong, Haddon-Cave was famous for his dislike of Chinese food, and at Chinese banquets, Haddon-Cave frequently insisted upon ordering steak.\n\nEconomist Milton Friedman hailed Haddon-Cave's \"positive non-interventionism\" as a fairly comprehensive implementation of laissez-faire policy. In his obituary, Haddon-Cave was regarded as \"one of the architects of the stability and prosperity that the [Hong Kong] people enjoy now as an autonomous region of China.\" Although he attempted to reform the tax system, he was praised for \"his disciplined intellectual approach to the task of balance of balancing the economy...by keeping tax levels and public expenditure low.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2021097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021097", "title": "Swinford", "text": "Swinford\n\nSwinford, (), is a town in County Mayo, Ireland. It is surrounded by the settlements of Midfield, Meelick, Culmore, Cloonaghboy, Killasser, Kinaffe and other villages. It is just off the N5 road, located 18 km (11 mi) from Ireland West Airport Knock (formerly known as Knock International Airport). Situated on a tributary of the River Moy, Swinford is known for its fishing waters, including the Callow lakes and the lakes of Conn and Cullin. Swinford was bypassed in 1993 by the N5 route and was the first town in Mayo to be bypassed.\n\nSwinford hosts one of County Mayo's largest summer festivals and has done since the mid-1980s: \"Siamsa Sráide Swinford\", (Fun in the Streets of Swinford). This street festival of pageantry, céilí dancing, and heritage displays depicts the traditions of East Mayo. The five-day festival takes place in the first week of August and features live bands playing open-air concerts as well as a heritage day, history walks and an busking competition.\n\nSwinford is used for the filming of TV show Hardy Bucks, as the fictional town of Castletown.\n\nUp to the mid-1980s the town had 3 second level schools: St. Patrick's college, St. Mary's Convent and the vocational school. All three schools amalgamated in August 1992 to become Scoil Muire agus Padraig.\n\nSwinford railway station opened on 1 October 1895, closed for passenger traffic on 17 June 1963 and finally closed altogether on 3 November 1975.\n\nJohn Dillon was a long-serving Member of Parliament for East Mayo at Westminster. His major policy issue was the resolution of the Land Question. Dillon took an uncompromising position in favour of the smallholders (small farmers) who sought to gain ownership of the land which they held as tenants from the largely Anglo-Irish landlords. From the middle of the 19th century, ongoing attempts were made at Westminster by the Liberal Party under William Ewart Gladstone to resolve the issue by passing the Irish Land Acts. Irish opinion, while welcoming of the initiative to resolve the injustice, was divided between the moderates, led by William O'Brien, who favoured a conciliatory approach (known as the doctrine of conciliation) and the hardliners. The hardliners supported an aggressive agrarian struggle and sought to advance simultaneously the struggle for Home Rule. On 25 August 1903, Dillon, addressing a meeting of his constituents at the Swinford Workhouse, spoke vehemently against the doctrine of conciliation. This divided the Party and led to the departure of William O’Brien. It became known as the \"Swinford Revolt\". Despite the turmoil, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, George Wyndham's Irish Land (Purchase Act) 1903 passed at Westminster, resolving the Irish Land Question.\n\nSwinford, like other areas in the West of Ireland, was the site of a number of actions during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921). According to one account, nationalists in East Mayo had a long running split dating back to the Parnell scandal, with relations between nationalist factions in Swinford and Meelick particularly poor. The failure to organise in advance of the Easter Rebellion in 1916 paradoxically meant however that relatively few Swinford men were arrested and interned, meaning they were outside the network of republican leaders that developed in the internment camps and prisons. It was not until approx 1920 that the IRA was structured in Swinford, and from then, with the participation of a group of young volunteers, the activity increased, particularly in the sphere of Republican Courts.\n\nAccording to the Galway Observer of Saturday, 24 July 1920, in an article entitled \"Shots in Swinford\": \nA military patrol of the Border regiment from Claremorris was fired at on Saturday night at Swinford and two soldiers were severely wounded. The soldiers halted at Swinford courthouse, from which four streets branch and immediately shots were fired at them by unknown parties. The lorry was riddled in several places with several bullets.\n\nThe military returned the fire, discharging as many as 500 rounds, with what result did not transpire. The wounded soldiers were conveyed to Claremorris, where their wounds were dressed prior to removal to the Curragh Hospital.\n\nOn 19 August 1920, IRA members broke into the goods shed at Swinford Railway station and destroyed 10 tons of food and fuel belonging to British security forces. Later that month, on 27 August 1920 IRA volunteers from Swinford and Bohola attacked and captured Ballyvary RIC Barracks, and on 27 November 1920 two Swinford men, James Henry and Thomas Fraher were convicted at a military court in Galway of possessing weapons and intelligence on the RIC. Both were sentenced to periods of imprisonment.\n\nLocal folklore has it that other British patrols were ambushed in rural areas outside the town, and that local Volunteers from the (Old) Irish Republican Army climbed onto the roof of the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks (now the site of the Gateway Hotel) and burnt it to the ground by breaking slates and pouring petrol into the building.\n\nDuring this period British soldiers were also billeted in the town.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1991.\n\nThe company specialises in site-specific theatre and produced its first show of this kind, \"A Christmas Carol\", in Cork City Gaol in 1994. One of the best-known new works produced by Corcadorca was \"Disco Pigs\" (written for the company by Enda Walsh). It was first staged in Triskel Arts Centre starring Cillian Murphy and Eileen Walsh and toured worldwide in 1996 and 1997.\n\nAmong the company's site specific productions were: \"The Trial of Jesus\" on Patrick’s Hill, \"A Midsummer Night’s Dream\" in Fitzgerald’s Park, the multi-stage \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Woyzeck\" at the Naval Base in Haulbowline.\n\nIn 2005, when Cork was European Capital of Culture, Corcadorca's Relocation programme saw off-site theatre companies from Poland, France and the UK stage a series of productions in city centre sites such as Elizabeth Fort, the Grand Parade and the city morgue.\n\nCorcadorca also develops new Irish writing. Apart from Enda Walsh it has also produced new plays by Conal Creedon, Raymond Scannell Eamonn Sweeney, and Pat McCabe.\n\nCorcadorca has been nominated for a number of Irish Times Theatre Awards, and has won four, including Best Play and Best Actress (Eileen and Catherine Walsh) for \"The Same\", and Best Lighting and Best Soundscape for Caryl Churchill's Far Away.\n\nIn 2011, Corcadorca set up the Theatre Development Centre (TDC), a studio space based in Triskel Arts Centre, as a way of resourcing the theatre sector in the region. The TDC supports around thirty projects each year as well as running SHOW, an annual platform for work in development, every November.\n\nThe name of the company is from the Irish \"Corca Dhorcha\", or \"dark Corca\". This is a play on \"Corca Dhuibhne\", the Dingle Peninsula, portrayed (jokingly) as a backward area of country bumpkins in Myles na gCopaleen's \"An Béal Bocht\".\n\n"}

Thara, son of the Gond leader Selris, is the only one to object to this practice; those who have become companions before have never been seen nor heard from again. The Second Doctor, Jamie and Zoe arrive in time to witness the death of the chosen companion Abu, who is vaporised by smoke sprayed from nozzles on either side of the doorway from which he emerges, and intervene to save Vana, the other selected for this fate, using her survival as a means to convince Selris and the Gonds of the malign influence of the Krotons on their society. The Doctor calls it \"self-perpetuating slavery\" by which the brightest in Gond society have been removed. Similarly, there are large gaps in their knowledge, especially relating to chemistry. This situation has been in existence for many years since the Krotons arrived in their spaceship, releasing a poison that polluted the lands beyond the Gond city – which the Gonds call \"the Wasteland\" – and killed much of the population.\n\nThara uses the disquiet of the situation to lead a rebellion and attack the Teaching Machines of the Krotons in the Hall of Learning. This prompts a crystalline probe to appear and defend the Machines, and warn the Gonds to cease. Zoe now tries the Teaching Machines and is selected to be a \"companion\" of the Krotons. The Doctor elects the same fate and both are summoned into the Dynotrope where they are subjected to a mental attack. Zoe deduces that the Krotons have found a way to transfer mental power into pure energy, while the Doctor busies himself with taking chemical samples of the Kroton environment. Circumstances now trigger the creation of two Krotons from chemical vats within the Dynatrope (the Kroton spaceship). The newly created Krotons capture Jamie, but are really seeking the Doctor and Zoe, the \"High Brains\", who have now left the Dynatrope. It takes Jamie quite some time before he is able to escape.\n\nEelek and Axus, two councillors previously loyal to the Krotons, begin to rally for all-out war with them and seize the initiative in Gond society. The more level headed Selris is deposed, but warns that an all-out attack will not benefit his people. Instead he has decided to attack the machine from underneath by destabilising its foundation in the underhall. Eelek has Selris arrested and reasserts control by negotiating with the Krotons that they will leave the planet if provided with the two \"High Brains\" who can help them power and pilot their ship. Zoe and the Doctor are forced into the Dynatrope and Selris dies, providing them with a phial of acid which the Doctor adds to the Kroton vats. Outside, Jamie and the scientist Beta launch an attack on the structure of the ship using sulfuric acid. This two-pronged assault destroys the tellurium-based Krotons and their craft. The Dynatrope dissolves away and the Gonds are free at last – choosing Thara rather than the cowardly and ambitious Eelek to lead them.\n\nLeaving the Gonds to find their own answers for the future, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe return to the Tardis.\n\nWorking titles for this story included \"The Trap\" and \"The Space Trap\". Holmes had originally submitted \"The Trap\" to the BBC as a stand-alone science-fiction serial in 1965. Head of Serials Shaun Sutton rejected the serial as being not the kind of thing the BBC was interested in making at the time, but suggested the writer pitch it to the \"Doctor Who\" production office as an idea for that series. Holmes did so, and although story editor Donald Tosh was interested, the scripts went no further at the time. Some years later, assistant script editor Terrance Dicks found the story in the production office files when clearing a backlog, and decided to develop it with Holmes as a personal project, in case other scripts fell through. When the latter event occurred (Dick Sharples script \"Prison in Space\", a comedic dystopian tale where females rule with dollybird guards, proved unworkable), Dicks was able to present the serial to his superiors as a ready production. Director David Maloney agreed the serial was viable, and it went before the cameras very quickly as an emergency replacement.\n\nRobert La'Bassiere is actually a pseudonym for Robert Grant, who requested that he be credited under this name for his appearance as one of the Krotons. Scenes set on the planet's surface were filmed at the Tank Quarry and West of England Quarry on the Malvern Hills.\n\nOne of the guest actors for The Krotons is Philip Madoc, who appeared in a different role later in the season in \"The War Games\" (1969) as well as in other roles with Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor.\n\nThe serial was repeated on BBC2 in November 1981, daily (Monday–Thursday, 9–12 November 1981) at 5:40 pm as part of \"The Five Faces of Doctor Who\", a series of repeats to bridge the long gap between seasons 18 and 19. At the time, it was the only four-part Patrick Troughton serial that existed in the BBC Archives. The viewing figures for the repeats were 4.4, 4.6, 4.6 and 4.5 million viewers respectively.\n\nAccording to the BBC's Audience Research Report on the first episode the story received a mixed reception from viewers. Some enjoyed the story, describing it as \"intriguing\" and \"compelling\". More critical viewers thought the series was becoming \"stale\" and \"boring\" and that it was \"too horrific\" and \"too far-fetched\". A small minority considered it to be \"the usual predictable rubbish\", some saying that they only watched the show because their children enjoyed it.\n\nPatrick Mulkern of the \"Radio Times\" gave the serial a mixed reception, acknowledging that \"The episodes are packed with incident, the slate-dark quarry filming is fluid and moody, and there are decent performances.\" but criticising the Krotons themselves as \"some of the silliest monsters ever to shame the series.\"\n\nThe serial was positively received by James Peaty of Den of Geek who noted that whilst the story was a fairly standard one it benefitted from the dramatic intensity and sharp dialogue crafted by the writer Robert Holmes. Peaty was also impressed by Philip Madoc's performance as Eelek and the direction by David Maloney. Although he considered the Krotons to be a \"workaday adventure\" Peaty said that \"there are still many things to enjoy within its relatively brisk 90 minute running time.\"\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in June 1985.\n\nThis story was released on VHS in February 1991. The soundtrack was released on CD in November 2008. \"The Krotons\" was released on DVD in the UK on 2 July 2012. The Region 1 DVD was released on 10 July 2012.\n\nEpisode One of \"The Krotons\" exists as both a 16 mm film print and a 35 mm telerecording negative. Clips taken from a VidFIREd transfer of the high quality 35 mm negative can be seen in the restoration documentary on the DVD release of \"The Aztecs\" and as part of the 40th Anniversary music video on \"Doctor Who\" DVDs released in 2003.\n\nThe \"special sounds\" from this serial by Brian Hodgson at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop were released on CD, Digital Download on 13 May 2013 with a limited run of 10\" vinyl 24 May 2013.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of Ulster Rugby. With the opening of a new stand for the 2014 Heineken Cup quarter-final against Saracens on 5 April 2014, the capacity of the stadium is now 18,196. The stadium is owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union.\n\nRavenhill Stadium opened in 1923. It features an ornate arch at the entrance that was erected as a war memorial for those players killed in World War I and World War II. Prior to 1923, both Ulster and Ireland played games at the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society grounds in Belfast.\n\nRavenhill has been the annual venue for the Ulster Schools Cup final since 1924, which is traditionally contested on St Patrick's Day. The stadium is traditionally the venue for the Ulster Towns Cup, played on Easter Monday.\n\nRavenhill has hosted 18 international matches, including pool games in both the 1991 and 1999 Rugby World Cups. The most recent Ireland international played at the stadium was on 24 August 2007 against Italy in a warm-up match for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Before that, Scotland was the last visitor in the 1954 Five Nations Championship. Ravenhill also hosted the 2007 Under 19 Rugby World Championship final in which New Zealand defeated South Africa.\n\nRavenhill hosted memorable Ulster games in the Heineken Cup. Ulster beat Toulouse 15-13 at Ravenhill in the quarter-finals of the 1998–99 Heineken Cup. Ravenhill then hosted the 1998–99 Heineken Cup semi-final in which Ulster defeated Stade Français 33-27. The most memorable moment in that game was when out half David Humphreys ran from the Ulster 10-metre line to score a try.\n\nOn 5 June 2014, Ulster signed a 10-year contract with the Kingspan Group for the naming rights to Ravenhill, meaning that the stadium will be known as the Kingspan Stadium until 2024. Despite this, fans still refer to the stadium simply as Ravenhill and the 'Kingspan Stadium' name has not made it into the vocabulary with regular Friday night fans.\n\nOn 30 May 2015, the 2015 Pro12 Grand Final was played at the Kingspan Stadium. Glasgow Warriors beat Munster 31–13.\n\nOn 26 August 2017, the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup Final was played at the Kingspan Stadium. New Zealand beat England 41–32. The semi-final matches and some play-off matches of the Women's Rugby World Cup were also played at the stadium.\n\nThe new stand at Ravenhill was officially opened on 9 October 2009 by First Minister Peter Robinson, before a match between Ulster and Bath Rugby. The stand has however been in use since the first home match of the 2009-2010 season, against Edinburgh Rugby.\n\nThe stand is on the Mount Merrion side of the ground, and consists of a terraced area, over 500 premium seats, and 20 corporate boxes. The terraced area is now covered by a roof for the first time in the stadium's history. The cost of the project is approximately £4.5 million, and has been funded by a mixture of public-sector funding, sales of premium tickets and boxes, and loans from the IRFU.\n\nIn 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive announced that it had granted £138m for various stadium redevelopment projects throughout Northern Ireland. Ulster Rugby received £14.5m, which was used to redevelop Ravenhill and expand its capacity from 12,000 to 18,000.\n\nIn 2012, Ulster Rugby confirmed that three new stands would be built at Ravenhill, with work commencing in late 2012. Two new stands at the Memorial and Aquinas ends of the stadium were completed while the main stand was demolished and rebuilt. The major refurbishment was completed in April 2014.\n"}

It is effective against thrips, aphids, spider mites, lygus, fleahoppers, and leafminers, but is primarily used as a nematicide. Aldicarb is a cholinesterase inhibitor which prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synapse. In case of severe poisoning, the victim dies of respiratory failure.\n\nAldicarb is one of the most widely used pesticides internationally, and is also one of the most environmentally toxic. Aldicarb poisoning from agricultural water runoff has led to the destruction of healthy ecosystems and the irreversible poisoning of fertile agricultural land. Poisoning from this pesticide is also believed to be linked to high cancer rates in communities located around the Aral Sea.\n\nAldicarb is effective where resistance to organophosphate insecticides has developed, and is extremely important in potato production, where it is used for the control of soil-borne nematodes and some foliar pests. Its high level of solubility restricts its use in certain areas where the water table is close to the surface.\n\nIn the United States, aldicarb was approved by the EPA for use by professional pesticide applicators on a variety of crops, including cotton, beans, and others. It is not approved for household use. The EPA started limiting the main aldicarb pesticide, Temik 15G, in 2010, requiring an end to distribution by 2017. Discontinuation of the use on citrus and potatoes began in 2012, with a complete phase out of the product expected by 2018. A new aldicarb pesticide named AgLogic 15G, was approved by the EPA in December 2011 and is said to be entering the market in 2015. It will be registered for use on cotton, dry beans, peanuts, soybeans, sugar beets, and sweet potatoes.\n\nTres Pasitos, a mouse, rat, and roach killer that contains high concentrations of aldicarb, has been illegally imported into the United States from Mexico and other Latin American countries. The product is highly toxic to animals and people, and according to the EPA \"should never be used in [the] home.\"\n\nAldicarb is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.\n\nAldicarb is manufactured by Bayer CropScience, but was formerly owned and produced by Union Carbide. Union Carbide's agricultural chemicals division was sold to Rhône-Poulenc. Later, Aventis Cropscience was formed from Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc Agrochemical, which lasted until Bayer acquired it in 2002.\n\nIn November 2009, corn treated with Temik was placed in and around peanut fields in Eastland County, Texas, near the town of Cisco. The corn was eaten by feral hogs, deer, and other animals, prompting the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to issue a hunting ban.\n\nAldicarb is a fast-acting cholinesterase inhibitor, causing rapid accumulation of acetylcholine at the synaptic cleft.\nIt is widely used to study cholinergic neurotransmission in simple systems such as the nematode \"C. elegans\".\n\nExposure to high amounts of aldicarb can cause weakness, blurred vision, headache, nausea, tearing, sweating, and tremors in humans. High doses can be fatal to humans because it can paralyze the respiratory system.\n\nIn South Africa (where Aldicarb is popularly known as Two Step) it is widely used by burglars to poison dogs.\n"}

{"id": "2021155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021155", "title": "Restored Apostolic Mission Church", "text": "Restored Apostolic Mission Church\n\nThe Restored Apostolic Mission Church (Hersteld Apostolische Zendingkerk - HAZK) was a Bible-believing, chiliastic church society in the Netherlands, Germany, South Africa and Australia. It came forth from the Catholic Apostolic Congregation at Hamburg that separated itself from the mother-church in 1863. In 1969-1971 it had fallen apart into three sections.\n\nThe Restored Apostolic Mission Church (HAZK) placed great emphasis on the fourfold ministry of apostles, prophets, evangelists and pastors (according to Ephesians 4:11). According to the official church-doctrine, apostles are placed 'first' (compare 1 Corinthians 12:28) and as the only ministry authorised to ordain ministers and to 'seal' members (comparable with the Catholic confirmation). Following the sealing the spiritual gifts became evident in the apostolic congregations, among which the gift of prophecy.\n\nIn 1897 the current New Apostolic Church (in those days still called the \"Hersteld Apostolische Zendinggemeente in de Eenheid der Apostelen\" (Restored Apostolic Mission Congregation in the Unity of the Apostles)) tore itself away from the HAZK. Here among other things the office of chief-apostle was introduced. (compare \"I am the vine, you are the branches.\" - John 15:5) The New Apostolic Church in turn produced in 1951, amongst others, the \"Apostolisch Genootschap\" (Apostolic Society).\n\nIn 1931 the Haarlem HAZK-congregation in the Jacobijnenstraat cut itself loose and continued on as \"Hersteld Apostolische Zendinggemeente\" (Restored Apostolic Mission Congregation). Some of the underlying reasons were the Haarlem point of view on the 'equality of the ministries' and strife over the doctrinal opinions around Christ.\n\nIn 1969 again a schism took place in the Restored Apostolic Mission Church under the leadership of the Amsterdam prophet H.M. van Bemmel, who had already for years opposed the apostolic supervision both verbally and in writing. He therefore also rejected the apostolic prophesying of J. van der Poorten, who in 1968 was called and ordained to the office of apostle. This prophesying called for the restoration of the original apostolic order. It turned into an insurrection against the lawful apostolic supervision, where vB and two other schismatic prophets during a last discussion with the practically complete apostolate on 29 November 1969 rejected the Old Testament as a guideline of faith and doctrine, unless the NT explicitly referred to it. However, the separatists, who are sometimes called 'Bemmelians' after their leader, maintained the old name HAZK, so now there were two church-societies with this name.\n\nIn the second half of 1970 a second group of prophets set itself up and on 14 October 1970 at Arnhem had themselves separated as 'the Elijah of this time' and who in roughly a year brought the HAZK to ruin by their prophesying. J. van der Poorten, who had already distanced himself before, laid down his ministry on Good Friday 1971, while confessing that the schism of 1863 was already unlawful. At Easter he was restored on prophetic direction to the office of apostle, but now at the re-established altar of the Catholic Apostolic Church. He was followed by a majority of the congregations of Amsterdam, Enkhuizen, a part of Utrecht and the congregation in Sydney. Since then there is in fact nothing left of the original HAZK.\n\nCause of the schism with the mother-church in 1863 was the calling of a new apostle by mouth of the German council-prophet Heinrich Geyer. In the course of a few years already five of the twelve British apostles had died, including Carlyle, apostle for North-Germany. A possible apostle-calling had been rejected the British apostolate in advance, but the angel (= overseer, compare Revelation 2 and 3) of Hamburg, Friedrich W. Schwartz, accepted the called Rosochacki as apostle with the agreement of nearly the whole congregation and withdrew the congregation from the supervision of apostle Woodhouse, who exercised the care for Germany. After a few weeks Rosochacki receded, but an attempt by Schwartz to then heal the breach, was rejected by Woodhouse. In Hamburg now the priest Preusz is called as apostle for North-Germany Schwartz for the Netherlands. The congregations under Preusz were called \"Allgemeine christliche apostolische Mission\" (ACAM). The ACAM also sent apostles to other German states and even to Hungary and the United States. In September 1863 Schwartz settled in Amsterdam, where he founded a flourishing congregation, in those days still known by the name \"Apostolische Zending\" (Apostolic Mission). Smaller congregations came into being during these years at Enkhuizen, Haarlem, IJmuiden and Hoorn.\n\nA chasm soon developed between the Dutch HAZK and the German ACAM because Schwartz had abolished the liturgical services and vestments. In the early years Schwartz had good contacts with the Free Evangelical Congregation) of Reverend Jan de Liefde, the well-known founder of the \"Association for the Salvation of the People\" (Vereniging tot Heil des Volks) in Amsterdam. Several ministers allowed themselves to be sealed in the HAZK, such as F.W. Menkhoff. The latter was first sent out as evangelist (1867) to Bielefeld (Westfalen) (which then was still part of the area of responsibility of Schwartz), after which he was called as angel in 1869 and as apostle in 1872 and soon founded several congregations. In 1869 Schwartz came also in contact with Dr. Groenewegen, who wrote \"The Book for our times)\" some of it based on the notations of Schwartz.\n\nAfter the death of Preusz in 1878, in Hamburg a certain Güldner was called as apostle by prophet Geyer. When Güldner was to be ordained, some, among whom Friedrich Krebs, tried to prevent this, which made Geyer and Güldner leave, followed by nearly all 300 members of the congregation. The little group of ten rebels joined up with the HAZK, after which Schwartz and Menkhoff, in spite of protests of the ACAM, appointed Krebs as counter-apostle to Güldner.\n\nFrom Germany, Krebs soon began to make an end to the autonomous work methods of the HAZK-apostles in the work- or tribal areas allotted to them. In his quest for the 'Unity of the apostles' he abolished the callings by mouth of the prophets and declared the office of prophet redundant, for Krebs would from then on appoint the most important ministers himself. Later the Australian apostle Niemeyer reacted to this with the mocking remark, that thus Krebs 'was surrounded by his own court of yes-men'. Since he deemed himself equal to the Christ, Krebs' words were more important than the Bible, for didn't he speak 'living words for these times'. Krebs' supporter and later chief-apostle Hermann Niehaus did call the Bible 'withered hay and stinking stagnant well water', while the opponents of Krebs in turn were denounced as 'Bible riders'. (This quote has been attributed to a church periodical which was published in Nov. 1896; from the date it must be concluded that it was in Wächterstimmen aus Zion, no. 11 of 1896). Krebs was the first who assumed the ministry of a chief apostle in the church in 1896. His successor was Hermann Niehaus.\n\nWhen Menkhoff died in May 1895, Krebs managed to accomplish that Niehaus became the successor of the first. This caused a fierce fight, and led by the faithful to the Bible prophet Hugo at least half the tribe separated. Half a year later, on 6 December 1895, Schwartz also died. Because the people in the Netherlands hardly knew what was happening in Germany, they accepted Krebs as caretaker apostle, until a successor would be called by one of church-prophets in a calling service which would be held especially. Meanwhile, the period of mourning of twelve weeks was lengthened by Krebs to a year and six weeks and Niehaus, who could speak Dutch reasonably well, was engaged to win the Dutch ministers to the 'New Light,' as Krebs' teachings were mockingly called. When in the Netherlands people began to fear that Krebs himself would indeed appoint a new subservient apostle, the ministers of the main congregation of Amsterdam demanded that the calling service would as yet be held according to the prescribed rules. This happened on 17 January 1897 conducted by Krebs and Niehaus, and here the Amsterdam deacon Martin van Bemmel was called as apostle for the Netherlands (indicated as the tribal area 'Judah') by means of an overwhelming number of prophecies and visions. He was accepted on the spot by all and inducted into the apostolate. When Van Bemmel did not wish to acknowledge Krebs' chief authority, a month later Krebs - without authorisation - informed Van Bemmel that he was deposed from the office of apostle. Kofman of Hoorn, supported by Krebs and Niehaus, now instigated a revolt against Van Bemmel and separated approximately half of the thousand members of the HAZK. They called themselves since then the 'Hersteld Apostolische Zendingkerk in de Eenheid der Apostelen' (Restored Apostolic Mission Church in the Unity of the Apostles), later to become the New Apostolic Church. Kofman was immediately appointed there as apostle by Krebs.\n\nUnder Van Bemmel important apostolic principals came under pressure. Shortly before his death Schwartz in his 'Concept' had laid down what was the correct order of the ministries. He literally wrote that the supervision and the authority in a tribal area rested with the apostolate, with \"all overseers (angels) of the congregations\" bound thereto. And further: \"The Apostle of the tribe is the Angel of the portal congregation. He has an angel-helper, who is called for this. The angel-helper can have a helper or elder with the purpose to assist in the ruling.\" Finally, in every congregation as many prophets, evangelists and pastors may be added as is necessary. Schwartz concluded his Concept with the compelling proclamation: This arrangement will remain as order for the tribe of Judah, given to the tribe by the Lord Jesus Christ by means of His Apostle.\n\nHaving become obstinate due to the conflicts with the Amsterdam ministry, apostle Van Bemmel put this spiritual law aside. He did not want to hear of any very much needed appointment of new ministers. He thought that the office of prophet was un-biblical; - the Holy Spirit revealed Himself by anyone with the gift of prophecy. Callings he found unnecessary, helpers he could appoint himself. Neither did he believe in the election of deacons by the congregation, he appointed them himself. Thus in a short time did not only the ministries of overseer (angel) and elder disappear, but also those of evangelist and prophet. In 1903 Van Bemmel was gravely rebuked for this apostasy in a word of prophecy with the words: 'Was it not I Who gave My deceased ap. Schwartz the Law of the Spirit? Therefore, My apostle, I want that thou shouldst bring this Law unto fulfilment,' etc.\n\nMeanwhile Van Bemmel began to proclaim the Sabellian fallacy in which the Trinity of God is denied; the Godly Being would not exist of three independent Persons but of one single Person. In old times God had revealed Himself as the Father, after that He became man as Jesus in Mary and finally He made Himself known as the Holy Spirit. All these deviations led to a parting of spirits in 1904. His father-in-law, pastor N.J. Verkruisen of Haarlem, closed his congregation to him, pastor Meijnders left Amsterdam to join Verkruisen, and pastor T. Korff of Enkhuizen wrote a sharp, warning letter. In 1913 the breach with Haarlem was healed, but there was no mention of the restoration of the disappeared ministries. Van Bemmel did hold calling services for Haarlem and Enkhuizen to replace the deceased Verkruisen and Korff, but because he regarded the office of prophet as unnecessary, he appointed deacons who had the gift of prophecy as 'acting prophets.' In 1920 because of internal pressures he held a calling service in Amsterdam, where by mouth of deacons a pastor and an evangelist were called, and, probably as a great shock to him, also a prophet. It would be a long wait, however, till the restoration of the congregational election of deacons.\n\nIn 1925 the deceased Van Bemmel was succeeded by the pious deacon-evangelist J.G. Kalwij. Rather quickly he already had problems with evangelist Verkruisen in The Hague, who proclaimed the democratic order that supervision and rule rested with the council of priests and not with the apostolate. After he was suspended for this in 1929 he separated his congregation. In 1931 in Haarlem, where J.W. Verkruisen had succeeded his father as pastor, there developed a terrible spectacle, when it was attempted to bring a deceased person back to life. After his suspension he followed his brother, whose opinion on the so-called 'equality of the ministries' he shared. He separated the congregation, which was joined by the congregations in Vlissingen and Australia. They adopted the name of \"Hersteld Apostolische Zendinggemeente\" (Re-established Apostolic Mission Congregation). \n\nUnder apostle Kalwij and his successor Dielof W. Ossebaar, who was called in 1947, there was some prosperity and the HAZK consisted of congregations in Amsterdam, Enkhuizen, Haarlem, Arnhem, Wageningen, Den Haag, Utrecht, Amersfoort, Groningen and Zwolle, and some in Germany, Austria, Australia and South Africa. At her height she had altogether about 2000 members, led by four apostles.\n\nIn March 1968 the number of apostles was augmented by three to a number of seven, wherefore the expectation that a revival was imminent seemed justified. Something happened, however, that no one had expected. The apostle Jacob van der Poorten (vdp), recently called for England (tribe Reuben), was moved to prophesying grave penance, in which the HAZK was called upon to return to the original apostolic order. It led to a fierce hurricane which in a short time brought the little hazk-ship to its doom. The deeper cause of this drama was the late apostle Van Bemmel's contempt for the spiritual law of Schwartz on overseer-ministries, instead of which he had introduced the unwise one-man-rule of the apostle. This understandably had led to opposition, not only of the Verkruisens, but also of others, among whom the Amsterdam prophet H.M. of Bemmel (vB). They again, however, made the mistake to violate the biblical order by stripping the office of apostle of its authority and to assign the church rule to a general counsel of priests. Already from the beginning of the commission of apostle Ossebaar, vB had tried to undermine the former's authority and when the apostolate had forbidden a communion-blessing favoured by vB and had forcefully prescribed the consecration form of the mother-church, his aversion towards the apostolate had grown into a bitter feud. The nucleus of the forbidden blessing read: 'We bless this bread into the sacramental body and this wine into the sacramental blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,' etc. As vB had expressly declared in word and writing, his main purpose was the use of the words \"blessing into\", wherefore it had the meaning that the priest made bread and wine into (sacramental) flesh and blood. By the rejection of these consecration-words he was so embittered, that he had considered separating himself. He even asserted that because of the abolishing of his communion-blessing the HAZK was under the judgement and was punished with satanic prophesying.\n\nAlready an opponent of apostolic authority, vB turned very quickly against the apostolic prophesying of vdp, asserting that it was a violation of the office of prophet. When vdp in early 1969 was moved to prophesy callings for the diaconal ministry, vB called for resistance: deacons should be chosen by the congregation, wherefore prophesied callings were un-biblical. Moreover, according to him, only prophets were authorised to prophesy callings. He neglected to mention that shortly before he had rejected the restoring of sub-deacons and had prevented a proposed diaconal election. When on Pentecost 1969 vdp was moved to prophesy the callings for the disappeared ministries of elder and angel, everything came to a head. vB and a number of supporters accused him that he, under devilish influence violated the 'spiritual law of Schwartz' and sought to restore the ordinances of the mother-church that Schwartz would have abolished. In reality it was vB himself who did not want anything to do with those old ordinances, while he knew very well from a book written about the mother-church by vdp that the latter was rather critical of her ordinances.\n\nIt soon became apparent that the 'Bemmelian' party were aiming for a split, with which vB had his own intentions. During tumultuous meetings they were completely uncooperative. Although it was shown with documents that the apostolic prophesying was in full accordance with Holy Scriptures and the spiritual law of Schwartz, they closed their ears and cried that they were not concerned with whatever evidence. Because in the apostolic prophesying reference was often made to the Old Testament and the mosaic tabernacle, they cried unashamedly to be unconcerned with this either and they said the same of the Epistle to the Hebrews and the Revelation, where there is spoken with such emphasis about the tabernacle. It was remarkable that up to the split there was not an incident of counter-prophesying. On the contrary, many, amongst whom their later prophets Hobé and Grimmelius, were often moved to prophesy impressive confirmations.\n\nDuring the 'robbers-meeting' of September 1969, the rebellious party carried out her intentions. With an air of importance the Haarlem pastor Rijnders, father of the current leader of the 'Bemmelians' put the following ultimatum to apostle Ossebaar: the prophesying of vdp had to be rejected as satanic and he as well as the other apostles called for the countries abroad should leave the country. With increasing indignation the meeting had heard the malicious man, not knowing what the rebels were planning to do. When with the concurrence of the majority of the meeting Ossebaar rejected the ultimatum, the trouble-makers stood up and left the meeting cursing.\n\nAt the insistence of the wavering ministry of Arnhem as yet an attempt was made in November to heal the split. At the beginning of that meeting of only apostles and prophets, where also the schismatic prophets vB, CB and Sch. were present, Ossebaar proposed to take Holy Scripture as the basis of the discussions. vB replied that he only wished to speak about 'the doctrine of the beginning,' which he understood as: 'Everything that is written in the N.T. and absolutely nothing more,' with which his two followers concurred. Then something shocking happened. Immediately after their Marcionitic rejection of the Old Testament, their own prophet CB was moved to contradict vB by prophesying that \"the entire Holy Scriptures\" contains the testimony of God. They would not be corrected, however, and continued to absolutely reject 'that there are matters that could be derived from the O.T. that were not explicitly written in the N.T.' Everyone knew that especially vB was lying, who with the exception of feast days, used to preach exclusively from the O.T., while his prophesying was similarly permeated with Old Testament figures. But because the acceptance of all Bible books would mean that he would have to acknowledge the apostolic prophesying of vdp as biblical, he preferred this awful denial. Thus the schism had become definite. The congregations led by the rebels of Haarlem, Utrecht, Amersfoort and Wageningen put themselves under the leadership of vB, who were joined by some members of Amsterdam and Den Haag. Then it also became apparent what had always been vB's purpose: at his command his communion-blessing was restored in the schismatic congregations. This company kept on calling itself HAZK, for which Ossebaar's enemy of years, J. Schaap was appointed as 'apostle' by mouth of vB.\n\nAlthough the large congregation of Arnhem had reluctantly concurred with the restoration of the old apostolic order of the ministries, she also entertained the sectarian opinion that prophesying was the exclusive task of prophets. When Ossebaar wanted to silence vdp because of prophecies he disliked and found support for this with the prophets, Ossebaar was warned in the word of prophecy that if he preferred their prophesying to the apostolic prophesying, he would get what he desired: the prophets would decline into a Jezebel and he himself into an Ahab. With this it was announced that Ossebaar would be dragged along by false prophesying and the congregations would be dispersed. Within a few weeks already this became reality in Arnhem. In a meeting led by Ossebaar great chaos developed because unauthorised prophets and members of the congregation prophesied commands and callings. This was the beginning of a terrible rule by the prophets that would totally destroy the HAZK.\n\nWhen vdp was moved to reject what had happened, Ossebaar and the prophets decided to silence him, whereupon he withdrew himself in July 1970. After his departure the false prophesying of the prophets burst forth with full intensity. On their command during October 1970 Ossebaar appointed in Arnhem twelve prophets as 'the Elijah of this time'. According to their own 'prophesying' they would produce a tremendous light and would perform world-shocking miracles. Before the commencement of this meeting a messenger read out a prophecy spoken by vdp, in which all were seriously advised to leave the church-building and that whoever would participate in this folly, would be consumed by fire from heaven.\n\nTo strengthen the confused members of the congregation against the false prophesying, vdp was moved to a counter-prophesying, which he regularly sent to the ministers of the HAZK. Because of this the Arnhem fools deteriorated into a great frenzy and they poured out their curses over him and everyone that would oppose them. On Good Friday 1971 vdp laid down his ministry in the HAZK and in spirit reunited himself with the British apostles, whereby he expressed that he rejected the schism of 1863. Dozens of priests and deacons openly indicated their readiness to do the same, whereupon Ossebaar on the command of the prophets deposed them, denied them the admission to the church and robbed them of their salary. When the prophets from the pulpit cursed everyone that supported the expelled ministers and believed the prophesying of vdp, Enkhuizen separated herself and the majority of the members of Amsterdam fled to seek comfort in other churches, or to attend the services that vdp was holding at his home.\n\nAmong the expelled were also all the members of the executive of the association 'De Amsterdamse Kas' (The Amsterdam Fund) that managed the properties of the congregation of Amsterdam, such as the church building on the Bloemgracht. The authority to depose and replace these managers, rested with the meeting of members of the congregation of Amsterdam. Without calling a meeting of the eligible members and without notifying them according to the rules, Ossebaar and overseer vdB fraudulently appointed themselves as managers and thus stole the church building and other property.\n\nNow that the resistance had been broken, the leaders of the prophets of Arnhem, WS and vH, gave themselves over to an unbelievable anti-Christian prophesying. Almost every old heresies was poured out over the poor multitude. The Godhead of Christ was denied, He would have been begotten by Joseph; every one would be a little bit god and christ; the concept of sin was a fantasy, for both good and evil were godly characteristics; every one should do what he thought was good and much more of those 'wonderful' things. Whoever believed this 'prophesying' of vH and WS had then properly become a spiritual human being and had no further need of any sacrament. As a sign symbolising this, the Lord's Supper was solemnly buried. With bread on a silver paten and wine in a silver chalice and followed by a number of ministers, Ossebaar proceeded to the toilet of the church-building of Arnhem, reverently tossed bread and wine into the toilet-bowl and flushed them with a solemn 'amen' into the sewers. During a gathering in the church-building of Arnhem vH even got in such a frenzy that he (respectfully watched by Ossebaar and consorts) smashed the furniture on the dais into pieces.\n\nWhen the prophets had finished their frenzy, Ossebaar and a small remnant came back to their senses. The ring-leaders refused, however, to become Christian again and left. Of the twelve prophets, that formidable Elijah, not one remained and there was nothing left of the altars but smoking piles of rubble, as it had been foretold in October 1971. The remnant again celebrates communion from time to time and with every effort remains silent on all the terrible things that had happened. They call themselves now \"Hersteld Apostolische Zendingkerk - Stam Juda\" (Restored Apostolic Mission Church - Tribe Judah) which only consists of a few small groups in Amsterdam and Arnhem.\n\n"}

Because of its ephedrine content, it possesses psychostimulant properties, affecting the central nervous system and also the heart.\nThe following alkaloids were reported from \"S. cordifolia\" growing in India: β-phenethylamine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, \"S\"-(+)-\"N\"-methyltryptophan methyl ester, hypaphorine, vasicinone, vasicinol, choline, and betaine.\nNo tannin or glycosides have been identified from the plant. The roots and stems contain the alkaloid ephedrine, normally observed in the different varieties of the gymnosperm genus \"Ephedra\". Recent analyses have revealed that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine constitute the major alkaloids from the aerial parts of the plant, which also show traces of sitosterol and palmitic, stearic and hexacosanoic acids. Two flavanones—5,7-dihydroxy-3-isoprenyl flavone and 5-hydroxy-3-isoprenyl flavone—and two phytosterols—β-sitosterol and stigmasterol—have been isolated from the plant. The analgesic alkaloid (5′-Hydroxymethyl-1′-(1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo [2,1-b] quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1-one) has also been found. Sterculic acid, malvalic acid, and coronaric acid have been isolated from the seed oil, along with other fatty acids.\n\n"}

He served as a U.S. Representative from Northern California between 1911 and 1917, and was instrumental in the creation of Muir Woods National Monument.\n\nKent was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 29, 1864. His parents, Adaline Elizabeth Dutton and meatpacking magnate Albert Emmett Kent (A.E. Kent) moved the family to Marin County in California in 1871, where his father had purchased 800 acres of valley land that would later become the town Kentfield, California.\n\nHe graduated from Yale University in 1887, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.\n\nFollowing graduation from Yale, Kent returned to Chicago and took up his father's real estate and livestock businesses, where he had inherited, among other interests, a tenement block adjacent to the Hull House settlement. After he was attacked as a slumlord in an 1894 speech by a Hull House resident, Kent donated the tenements to Hull House, which would later raze the property to build one of the first public playgrounds in the United States.\n\nKent became a donor and volunteer at Hull House, and served on its Board of Trustees, where he would meet Jane Addams and other leading Chicago reformers. Kent subsequently ran successfully for alderman in 1895 and founded the Municipal Voter's League of Chicago in 1896, a group that used publicity to push corrupt politicians from office.\n\nIn 1907, Kent returned to California from Chicago and entered federal politics by winning election in 1910 as a progressive Republican to the 62nd United States Congress. For the 63rd and 64th Congresses, Kent was re-elected as an Independent. In total, Kent served in Congress from March 4, 1911 to March 4, 1917.\n\nKent was a vocal proponent of anti-Asian and exclusionary immigration policies throughout his political career. Campaigning in 1910, Kent told the Asiatic Exclusion League that \"I have made a large part of my campaign on the Asiatic Exclusion idea, comparing it with the racial troubles brought on by the needless importation of negroes.\" In Congress, Kent pushed legislation barring Asian immigrants from owning land, becoming U.S. citizens, and entering the United States altogether. Kent also supported legislation instituting a literacy test for prospective immigrants, explaining he would \"rather have a test of blood and race, and confine our immigration to northern Europe, but failing that, the literacy test.\"\n\nIn 1916, Kent was the lead sponsor of legislation in the House of Representatives establishing the National Park Service, with companion legislation in the Senate sponsored by Reed Smoot. The legislation passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916, passed the Senate on August 5, and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.\n\nKent was also responsible for the establishment of Muir Woods National Monument on 611 acres of land along Redwood Creek that Kent and his wife Elizabeth Tacher Kent had originally purchased in 1905 for $45,000 in an effort to preserve the property's groves of old-growth redwoods. After a local water company began condemnation proceedings in 1907 in an effort to create a reservoir on the site, Kent quickly deeded 295 acres of the property to the U.S. Department of the Interior for the establishment of a national monument under the recently-passed Antiquities Act. Established as a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt on January 6, 1908, Kent asked the site be named in honor of conservationist John Muir.\n\nBeyond Muir Woods, Kent's efforts to preserve land on Marin County's Mount Tamalpais led to the creation of the Marin Municipal Water District in 1912, which utilized land donated by Kent for its watershed.\n\nKent's efforts as a conservationist were not exclusive of development and growth. The establishment of Muir Woods as a national monument coincided with the development of the Mt. Tamalpais & Muir Woods Railway as a popular tourist attraction, a business in which both Kent and his father had an interest in. In Congress, Kent was a key proponent of 1913 legislation creating the Hetch-Hetchy Reservoir, a stance that ultimately cost him his personal friendship with John Muir, who Kent would call \"a man entirely without social sense.\"\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Kent was appointed by President Woodrow Wilson to the United States Tariff Commission in 1917. In lobbying the Wilson administration for his appointment, Kent alluded to a possible run for governor of California, writing Wilson ally Norman Hapgood that \"I probably could secure the governorship here if I wanted it, but I do not like the idea of getting down to state matters when my view has been directed at national affairs.\" Kent served on the Tariff Commission until his resignation in 1920 to make an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nKent was married to Elizabeth Sherman Thacher on February 26, 1890. Elizabeth Thacher Kent was the daughter of Yale professor and administrator Thomas Anthony Thacher. Together they had seven children including sons Sherman Kent (Yale professor and alumni of the US Central Intelligence Agency) and Roger Kent (US politician). His daughter was prominent artist, Adaline Kent. Sherman Day Thacher was his brother-in-law.\n\nKent died on March 13, 1928 in Kentfield, California from pneumonia. His remains were cremated in Oakland, California. He was survived by wife, five sons, two daughters, and ten grandchildren.\n\n"}

The child was given to a childless woman to raise. The area where the child was found eventually became Kuta Buluh. When that child grew older, he married a woman of Sukatendel village.\n\nHe had five children, the middle being Dewa Perangin-angin. Dewa Perangin-angin converted to Islam, in order to marry Paga Ruyung of Deli Tua.\n\nThey had three children, Sutan Jabar, Sutan Husin and Putri Hijau. Sutan Husin was in a dispute with his brother, Sultan Jabar, so Slutan Jabar went to Malacca, while Sutan Husin following the Wampu river upstream, and stopped to rest where it met another river (the Bohorok). Eventually he built a house at this point. One day, while on a hunting trip, he climbed the hill from the river, and finding an unknown sweet-tasting fruit tree at the top named it Buah Huruk (or fruit that is atop the hill in Karo language).\n\nBohorok had previously been called Tanjung by the Malays as it was the meeting point of the two rivers.\n\nBohorok was involved in trade along the Wampu river, buying salt at Pangkalan Brandan from the Kampar Malays there. Tengku Tan Deraman, son of Tengku Djukdin, son of Tengku Panji Sakar, son of Tengku Syahmardan, son of Sutan Husin, was the first to promote the cultivation of land for farming.\n\nThe lineage of Bahorok kingdom, from the 16th century is said to be:\n\nThus Bahorok is a historically Malay-Karo kingdom.\n\nThe kingdoms of Bohorok, Stabat and Binjai eventually united to form the kingdom of Langkat, which became Langkat Regency under Dutch rule, and also later under Indonesian rule.\n\nThe name of \"Bahorok\" district was officially changed from Bohorok in 1987, due to a forging of the official stamp of Bohorok. Other government departments still use the name Bohorok.\n\nTo the south lies Karo Regency, to the west Southeast Aceh province, to the east Salapian district, and to the north Batang Serangan district.\n\nThere are 22 desa and luruh within Bahorok district:\n\nThe district is mostly Muslim (88%), with 11% Protestant, and negligible others.

{"id": "2021210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021210", "title": "Swell box", "text": "Swell box\n\nIn an organ, \"Swell\" (German: \"Schwellwerk;\" French: \"Récit\") refers to the division whose pipes are enclosed in a swell box. This box has a large opening covered with moveable shades or shutters which resemble heavy venetian blinds. When open, these shutters allow the pipes' sounds to travel freely from the box to the room. When closed, most of the sound is contained in the box. Thus the moveable shades provide a means of adjusting the loudness of the sound, and perhaps more importantly, of gradual crescendo (\"swelling\") and decrescendo.\n\nThe advantage of this arrangement is that a given pipe only plays at one given loudness. If the wind pressure were varied in an attempt to change the loudness, the pitch, tone quality, attack and decay and other characteristics would also change. In fact, organ builders have to go to a lot of trouble to provide a steady, unchanging wind supply. So the only way to gradually increase or decrease the loudness of a pipe is to enclose it in a swell box, and then to gradually open or close the shutters.\n\nThis has its drawbacks. No matter how a swell box is designed, the sound of the pipes is compromised by enclosing them. Since much organ repertoire was written before gradual crescendo and decrescendo effects became common, this seems to represent an unnecessary degradation of the music. On the other hand, building an organ with no swell box – and thus unable to play later music – also seems to be a compromise.\n\nThe usual way of dealing with this problem is to build an organ in which the pipes are divided into several sections or divisions, one or more of which are enclosed in a swell box or boxes, the other divisions remaining unenclosed. The kinds of music which are least compatible with enclosed pipes are precisely the kinds where gradual crescendo and diminuendo are not required.\n\nThe invention of the swell box has been credited to two organ-builders called Abraham Jordan, a father-and-son team which was active in the early eighteenth century (for example at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, London). It took time to be adopted in other countries and therefore some of the best organ music, for example that of Bach, was not written with a swell box in mind. \n\nThe Jordans´ work can be seen as a development of earlier technology, but its significance was recognised at the time. The \"Spectator\" announced that \"Whereas Mr Abraham Jordan, senior and junior, have, with their own hands, joinery excepted, made and erected a very large organ in St Magnus' Church, at the foot of London Bridge, consisting of four sets of keys, one of which is adapted to the art of emitting sounds by swelling notes, which never was in any organ before; this instrument will be publicly opened on Sunday next [14 February 1712], the performance by Mr John Robinson. The above-said Abraham Jordan gives notice to all masters and performers, that he will attend every day next week at the said Church, to accommodate all those gentlemen who shall have a curiosity to hear it\".\n\nAristide Cavaillé-Coll refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters.\n"}

Set in 1987, it follows a suburban housewife in Los Angeles whose monotonous life is abruptly changed when she becomes sick with a mysterious illness caused by the environment around her.\n\nThe film topped the \"best film of the 1990s\" poll by \"The Village Voice\", and was described by critics as \"the scariest film of the year\", \"a mesmerizing horror movie\", and \"a work of feminist counter-cinema\". 20 years after the film's release, Haynes said its themes—disease and immunity in a post-industrial landscape and how recovery is a burden often put on victims of illness—were even more relevant than they were when the film was released.\n\nCarol White is a housewife living in an affluent suburb of Los Angeles. She passes her days with activities like gardening, aerobics, and seeing friends. Her marriage and family life appear stable but sterile, and her friends are polite but distant. Following the renovation of the family's home, Carol suddenly starts experiencing physical symptoms when she is around certain everyday chemicals: she coughs uncontrollably when breathing exhaust fumes from a nearby truck while driving, has breathing difficulties at a baby shower, and suffers from a nosebleed while getting a perm at a hair salon. As her symptoms worsen, the chemicals that are triggering them seem ubiquitous. Finally, she has a complete collapse when visiting a store that is fumigated with pesticides. \n\nDoctors have no idea how to cure or help Carol. She attends some psychotherapy sessions, but her symptoms are not alleviated. She finds that she is very alone with her disease when her community behaves indifferently towards her. Accepting that she can no longer function in her current life, she leaves her home, possessions, and life behind. Without her husband, she moves to Wrenwood, an eerie new-age desert community for people with environmental illness. Wrenwood, which has cult-like aspects, is led by a man whose relentless motivational talks amount to \"psychological fascism\".\n\nEven in a community of people with similar health issues, Carol only seems to become more isolated. Ultimately, the film presents no answer for her illness or predicament. Her condition is given no name in the film, but director Haynes confirmed that it is a depiction of multiple chemical sensitivity. He also said that Carol's isolation was both the answer and the problem for her.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 1995. Sony Pictures Classics acquired distribution rights to the film and released the film in a limited release on June 23, 1995.\n\n\"Safe\" received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports 86% approval based on 56 reviews, and the film holds a score of 76/100 on Metacritic. Janet Maslin, writing in \"The New York Times\", lauds the first half of the film, but concludes that, as “brilliantly as it begins, \"Safe\" eventually succumbs to its own modern malady, as the film maker insists on a chilly ambiguity that breeds more detachment than interest”…. “Mr. Haynes makes fools of …[the film’s] New Agers while possibly embracing some of their views.” Another problem, according to Maslin, is that “the shadow of AIDS implicitly hangs over …[Carol’s] decline, but it doesn't help bring \"Safe\" to a conclusion worthy of its inspired beginning”.\n\nThe ending of the film is highly ambiguous, and has created considerable debate among critics and audiences as to whether Carol has emancipated herself, or simply traded one form of suffocation for an equally constricting identity as a reclusive invalid. Julie Grossman argues in her article \"The Trouble with Carol\" that Haynes concludes the film as a challenge to traditional Hollywood film narratives of the heroine taking charge of her life, and that Haynes sets Carol up as the victim both of a male-dominated society, and also of an equally debilitating self-help culture that encourages patients to take sole responsibility for their illness and recovery.\n\nCarol's illness, although unidentified, has been seen as an analogy for the 1980s AIDS crisis, a similarly uncomfortable and largely unspoken \"threat\" during the Reagan presidency.\n\n\"Safe\" received seven votes in the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" poll of the greatest films – with five votes from critics and two from directors – ranking it 323rd and 322nd, respectively. \"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?\", a website which gathers critics' polls, has also found \"Safe\" to be the 472nd most acclaimed movie of all time.\n\nThe movie was widely critically acclaimed, giving Moore her first leading role in a feature film, and gave Haynes a measure of mainstream critical recognition. \n\n\n"}

The urban zone is situated on the slopes of Bozdağ mountain chain along the southern alluvial plains of the Gediz River. To the north and northeast of the plain extend two other mountain ranges, respectively those of the mounts Dibek (\"highest altitude 1.120 m\") and Üşümüş (\"highest altitude 1085 m\").\n\nThe town lies at an altitude of 125 meters from the sea level. Its advantageous location, smooth and busy intercity connections and the fertile soil allowed Salihli to develop extremely well in recent past.\n\nFour streams, namely Alaşehir, Gümüş, Kurşunlu and Sart cross the district area to join the River Gediz, which flows westward. The climate type is Mediterranean climate. To the north of the city is Demirköprü Dam, used for irrigation, prevention of overflows, energy production and fishing, and which was built between 1954 and 1960.\n\nThe population figures in the 2000 census were 149,150 for the whole district and 83,137 for the urban center of Salihli. (The urban population is 96,304 as of 2009)\n\nAside from the city of Salihli, the district counts 8 townships with own municipalities. These are (Adala, Durasıllı, Gökeyüp, Mersinli, Poyrazdamları, Sart, Taytan and Yılmaz). Of these Sart corresponds to the location of ancient Sardes, the capital of Lydia.\n\nThe district area is surrounded by the neighboring districts of Ahmetli to the west, Gölmarmara to the northwest, Gördes and Köprübaşı to the north, Demirci to the northeast, Kula to the east, Alaşehir to the southeast and Ödemiş to the south.\n\nThe distances from Salihli to the seat of neighboring provinces are as follows:\nThe distances from Salihli to another cities of Manisa are as the following:\n\nSalihli is a city with a long history. The fossil footprints discovered near the villages of Sindel and Çarıklar, Manisa, estimated to be between 10,000 and 26,000 years old, are the first traces of prehistory in the region. However, the region came to foremost importance with the establishment of the city of Sardes, which is located west of Salihli center and where the most remarkable historical artifacts and remains of the region are found.\n\nSardes was the capital city of Lydia until 547 B.C., at which date it was captured by the Persian Empire and governed by satraps until 334 B.C.. After the Persians, the region was governed successively by the Macedonian Empire, the Kingdom of the Attalids, Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire. In the beginning of the 14th century, Turks under the Beylik of Saruhan captured the city and the region and ruled it for a century from their base in nearby Manisa. In 1400 the region passed over to the Ottoman Empire under which Manisa preserved its position as a primary regional center. In the beginning of the Ottoman rule, Salihli was a village of the kaza of Sart, depending the province seat of Aydın, situated more to the south, and was called Evlâd-i Salih (\"meaning \"the children of Salih\" in English\"). In the 19th century, with the construction of İzmir-Uşak-Afyon railway, Salihli demonstrated a much more rapid pace of progress compared to Sart and gained township status in 1872, when it became a kaza of the sancak of Saruhan (Manisa).\n\nDuring the Greco-Turkish War, the city was taken by Greek forces on 24 July 1920, then re-taken by the Turkish army on 5 September 1922. According to a number of sources, the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war. According to James Loder Park, the U.S. Vice-Consul in Constantinople at the time, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, 65% of Salihli had been destroyed.\n\nAfter the war, Salihli became one of the biggest and the most important districts of Manisa.\nIt is not always easy to make estimates on Salihli's population before the establishment of the Republic of Turkey due to the lack of adequate sources. However, a population of 500 people was confirmed for Sart during the 1831 census. The city grew quite fast after the construction of the railway until the Turkish War of Independence. In the yearbook of 1891, 3000 people and in the yearbook of 1908, 4400 people were documented to be living in Salihli. In the first Republican census of 1927, 7191 people were recorded. The departure of the town's minority populations in 1923 also caused the population to decrease.\n\nSalihli has always been an attractive destination for immigrants. In the Ottoman era, the region was a favorite stopover for nomad clans (\"aşiret\"). Today, it is still possible to trace the names of some of the region's villages to the original aşiret names such as Karayahşi, Araplı, Burhan, Beylikli, Çökelek, Eldelek, Dombaylı, Durasıllı, Sindel etc. Moreover, some aşiret names refer to unsettled localities, such as Sığıralcısı, Bayındırlı, Karatekeli, Kuşdoğanlı, Kacar, Taras, Karakeçili. After the 1890s until the 1950s, Salihli also attracted many immigrants moving into Turkey from the Balkans, from Yugoslavia and Bulgaria particularly. Many Turkic-speaking immigrants from Xinjiang, China chose to live in Salihli during the Chinese revolutionary disturbances.\n\nBy considering the population increase rate according to 1985–1990 census, as of 1995 an approximate number of 170,000 people were living inside the boundary of the city.\nAccording to the census of 2009, the population in Salihli (including rural area) is 155 333 where 96 503 people were recorded in the city center.\n\nThis part of the population, mainly Kazakhs and known as \"Türkistanlılar\" in the city came to Salihli between 1954 and 1955 in the following years. After the 1970s, some immigration from Eastern Anatolia also came to strengthen the ranks of the previous immigrants. Counter movements in the population were towards Turkey's big cities and to Europe, especially to Germany and France).\n\nThe economy of the city is based on agriculture, agricultural commerce and industry.\n\nAgriculture:\n\nThe main agricultural products are seedless Sultana grapes, wheat, barley, cotton, tobacco and maize. The fertility of the region's soil also allows for the cultivation of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Cherries known as the Napoleon breed grown especially in the villages of Allahdiyen and Gökköy and the potatoes locally known as \"Bozdağ potatoes\" are particularly famous.\n\nStockbreeding is another source of income for rural inhabitants, of rising importance especially in the last decade.\n\nIndustry:\n\nThe recent building of Salihli Organized Industrial Zone (in Turkish \"Salihli Organize Sanayi Bölgesi\"), extending over an area of 111 hectares in a triangular zone between the close district centers of Salihli, Alaşehir and Kula, became a great opportunity to provide new employment opportunities in the region and accelerate the pace of industrialization.\n\nSmaller industrial enterprises are concentrated in Salihli self, where there are 32 brick works and tileries drawing on the region's rich reserves in raw materials for bricks, 2 flour mills, 2 valonia oak factories, 10 cotton gin factories, 2 grape operating works, 1 feed grain factory, 1 industrial tube factory, 1 tomato dressing factory, 2 olive oil mills, 2 beverage factories, 1 water bottling factory, 1 mineral water company and 1 emery rock factory.\n\nTourism:\n\nThe remains of Sardis, which notably includes the Lydian King named Giges's tomb, the Artemis Temple and a Marble Court with Gymnasium built by the Romans, as well as other historical vestiges are widely visited by tourists, nationally and internationally.\n\nTo the 5 and . south of the town, there are lead and mud baths named \"Kurşunlu Kaplıcaları\", which are famous across the region. These thermal springs are visited especially to treat rheumatic disorders, sciatica, lumbago, arthritis, neuralgia, orthopaedic disorders, several skin diseases, some gynecological conditions and kidney disorders. Moreover, a recent geothermal energy production project intends to use these thermal sources and provide heating for the city of Salihli.\n\nThere are also many excursion possibilities around Salihli. 'Bozdağ' summits and the Lake Gölcük located near the top of one of the summits is at a very high altitude. The restaurants and cafes situated on the hills around Bozdağ have views over Salihli.\n\nSports activities are also quite developed in and the city was represented for a long time in the Turkish Second League by Yeni Salihlispor. Today, nearly 1500 licensed sportsmen are competing in various sports activities in Salihli, such as football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, judo, wrestling, oil wrestling, folk dance and chess. There are 10 football clubs representing Salihli in amateur league of Turkey and 1 female volleyball club is in the 2nd league.

He currently co-stars on BET's \"Real Husbands of Hollywood\" and the \"Grey's Anatomy\" spin-off, \"Station 19\" as Battalion Chief Robert Sullivan.\n\nKodjoe was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of Ursula, a German psychologist of partial Jewish descent, and Eric Kodjoe, a Ghanaian physician who is of the Ga-Adangbe people. His namesake is the Russian poet and writer Boris Pasternak. Kodjoe's matrilineal great-grandmother was Jewish and was murdered in the Holocaust; his maternal grandmother survived the war in hiding. Kodjoe's parents divorced when he was six years old. He grew up in the vicinity of Freiburg im Breisgau. Kodjoe speaks fluently in different languages such as German, English, and French, and speaks a little Spanish. He has a brother named Patrick and two sisters named Nadja and Lara.\n\nKodjoe attended Virginia Commonwealth University on a tennis scholarship, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in marketing in 1996. A four-year letterman on the Rams' men's tennis team, he is currently ninth in school history with 75 career singles wins.

AFB's priorities include broadening access to technology, elevating the quality of information and tools for the professionals who serve people with vision loss, and promoting independent and healthy living for people with vision loss by providing them and their families with relevant and timely resources. Kirk Adams, formerly the first blind president and CEO of The Lighthouse for the Blind, has been AFB's president and CEO since May 2016.\n\nAFB, with the support and leadership of M.C. Migel, a philanthropist who was moved to help the large number of veterans blinded in World War I, was formed in 1921 to provide both a national clearing house for information about vision loss and a forum for discussion for blindness service professionals. Its founding, made official at the convention of the American Association of Workers for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa, was also intended to spur research and represent the needs of people with vision loss in the US government.\n\nAFB's early accomplishments included taking the lead to standardize English Braille code and establishing the first professional publications program for teachers and administrators of programs for people with vision loss. In 1926, AFB's \"Directory of Services for Blind and Visually Impaired Persons\" was first published.\n\nIn 1932, AFB engineers developed the Talking Book and Talking Book Machine and set up studios for the recording these books, marking the advent of the modern audiobook. AFB played a major role in persuading the federal government to include talking books in the National Library System for blind people operated by the Library of Congress. \n\nAFB's advocacy efforts have led to the passage of significant legislation for people with vision loss. AFB was instrumental in creating and passing the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and more recently worked on the renewal of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to ensure that it contained provisions to meet the specific needs of children with vision loss.\n\nFor many years, AFB designed, manufactured and sold products that were made specifically for people with vision loss, such as braille writers, magnifiers, and audio blood pressure monitors. AFB also works with technology manufacturers at the design stage to develop products that can be used by everyone, sighted or visually impaired. Especially since the advent of digital technology, AFB believes that working to establish universal design practices among technology producers is the most promising and cost-effective option for making all products accessible in the long term.\n\nAFB is the organization to which Helen Keller devoted her life. She worked for AFB for more than 40 years and was instrumental in the foundation of the Talking Books Program, among many others. She remained with AFB until her death, in 1968. Under the terms of her will, she selected AFB as the repository of her papers and memorabilia, which AFB maintains in the Helen Keller Archives of its New York City headquarters.\n\nLouis Braille was the Frenchman who invented the raised dot code that bears his name. On January 4, 2009, the 200th anniversary of his birth, AFB created an online gallery that includes pictures of him and digitized books and articles.\n\nAFB's main headquarters is in Arlington, Virginia. Other offices include New York City; Dallas, Texas; and Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nIn 2012, AFB added VisionAware to its family of sites in partnership with the \"Reader's Digest\" Partners for Sight Foundation. The site folded in content from AFB's Senior Site, with new information and resources for adults of all ages with vision loss.\n\nVisionAware's goal is to help adults and their family members to cope with age-related eye diseases, a growing public health problem in the United States. According to research on vision problems in Americans over 40, rates of vision loss from diseases like age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy are expected to double by 2030, as America's 78 million baby boomers reach retirement age.\n\nIn spring 2008, AFB and the National Association for Parents of Children with Visual Impairments (NAPVI) launched FamilyConnect, an online community for caregivers of children with visual impairments. NAPVI is an affiliate of Lighthouse Guild.\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications, as part of a duopoly with Blanco-licensed UniMás owned-and-operated station KNIC-DT (channel 17). The two stations share studios on Network Boulevard in Northwest San Antonio; KWEX operates a secondary studio facility at the Texas A&M–San Antonio Educational and Cultural Arts Center on South Santa Rosa in downtown San Antonio. The station's transmitter is located off of Route 181 in northwest Wilson County (northeast of Elmendorf). On cable, KWEX-DT is available on channel 8 on most systems in the market.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on June 10, 1955 as KCOR-TV. The callsign was taken from its radio sister station KCOR (1350 AM), which itself was named for Raoul Cortez, the owner and pioneer of the first full-time Spanish-language radio and television stations in the United States by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). KCOR-TV was also the first Spanish-language commercial television station in the U.S., as well as the first television station in south Texas to broadcast on the UHF band. The station originally operated from studio facilities located on Network Boulevard (southwest of the present-day I-10) on the city's northwest side.\n\nIn 1961, after KCOR-TV had been losing money for years, Cortez sold the station to a consortium led by his son-in-law Emilio Nicolas, Renold Anselmo, Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, Julian Kaufman and Frank Fouce. With the change in ownership, the station changed its call letters to KUAL-TV that year. Since the station's beginnings, Nicolas had worked side by side with Cortez, not only running the station, but producing many of channel 41's variety programs. Nicolas made the station a financial success, and in 1962 Nicolas and his partners built their second television station, KMEX-TV in Los Angeles. The two stations, with KUAL as the \"de facto\" founding station of the entire network, formed the nuclei of the first Spanish language television network in the United States; later that year, the station changed its calls to KWEX-TV, as the station became a charter affiliate of the Spanish International Network (which was relaunched as Univision in 1987).\n\nOn July 29, 2013, KWEX relocated from its longtime Durango Boulevard studios in San Antonio's Southtown district to a new facility on Network Boulevard. The facility, which was constructed over the course of six months, cost $10 million to build and includes expanded master control and newsroom space, two studios for production of its newscasts and local programs (one of which includes a kitchen set used for food segments); Univision Communications' San Antonio radio cluster—KCOR, KBBT (98.5 FM), KCOR-FM (95.1 FM), KROM (92.9 FM), KXTN-FM (107.5)—relocated their operations to the facility in late summer 2013. Plans called for the former studio facility to be torn down with an apartment complex being built on the property, a plan that was opposed by the San Antonio Conservation Society and the Texas Historical Commission, who proposed that the building be restored and incorporated into the new development.\n\nOn August 10, 2013, KWEX signed a three-year lease agreement with Texas A&M University–San Antonio to use the university educational and cultural arts center on the site of the Museo Alameda (which closed in August 2012) in the Market Square district of downtown San Antonio as a secondary studio facility; the station built a , HD-ready studio for use during live segments seen on the station's 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts as well as its morning insert \"Despierta San Antonio\", Texas A&M communications students will also have access to the studio when it is not in use for KWEX productions. The new facility opened on February 18, 2014.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKWEX-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to channel 41.\n\nThe station's former digital allocation on UHF channel 39 and their facilities were subsequently transferred in full to CBS affiliate KENS (channel 5), which shared KWEX's signal as a full 1080i high definition subchannel in 2008 and early 2009, mapping to virtual channel 5.1 due to their transitional digital channel on UHF 55 being sold to Qualcomm for their MediaFLO mobile television service. At the time, KWEX had broadcast solely in 480i standard definition, so both KENS and KWEX broadcast over digital channel 39 without any issues between the two stations.\n\nKWEX-DT presently broadcasts seven hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour each on weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces a series of interview segments titled \"Despierta San Antonio\" (\"Wake-up San Antonio\"), which airs at around 25 and 55 minutes past the hour during Univision's national morning program \"Despierta America\" on weekday mornings.\n\nWith the move to the new studios on Network Blvd., on July 29, 2013, KWEX-DT became the fifth television station in the San Antonio market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.\n\n"}

She played a significant role in the government of Ethiopia during her lifetime, acting as de facto co-regent or advisor to a number of emperors; one testimony of this is the manuscript Bruce 88, which states that she had been in the palace of three illustrious Emperors: Zara Yaqob; his son by another wife, Baeda Maryam I (r. 1468–1478), and Na'od (r. 1494–1505). \n\nThe daughter of the King of Hadiya, her kingdom was invaded by Emperor Zara Yaqob for refusing to pay the annual tribute, leading to her capture and forceful conversion to Christianity as well as marrying Zara Yaqob. Hadiya rulers appealed to the Adal Sultanate for assistance leading to the climax of conflict in the region during the Abyssinian-Adal war. Although the Portuguese historian Baltasar Teles wrote that she had no children, in some manuscripts of Francisco Álvares's \"The Prester John of the Indies\", a male relative of Lebna Dengel who escaped from Amba Geshen is described as her son, according to the translator but not the original text\n\nWith his own mother Tsion Mogasa dead, Emperor Baeda Maryam I gave Eleni the title of Queen Mother. She proved to be an effective member of the royal family; Paul B. Henze comments that she \"was practically co-monarch\" during his reign. When Eskender succeeded his father Emperor Baeda Maryam I, at first Empress Eleni was pushed out of power by the Bitwoded Amda Mikael. However, around 1486 she participated in a palace coup that led to his deposition and execution, and Queen Eleni thereafter played a leading role in the Emperor's government, which continued into the reign of Emperor Na'od.\n\nÁlvares was told by the \"Abuna\" Marqos, that upon Emperor Na'od's death in combat \"he and Queen Eleni made him [Lebna Dengel] King, because they had all of the great men in their hands\" This statement points to the power Eleni wielded. Likewise Eleni, understanding the increasing threat that Ethiopia faced from the growing Ottoman influence in the region, with the counsel of Pero da Covilhã sent Mateus (also known as Matthew the Armenian) as an ambassador to the King of Portugal and the Pope in Rome, a fact that the Portuguese only understood after they arrived in Ethiopia, and which complicated Dom Rodrigo da Lima's mission to the Ethiopian Emperor. Eleni served as chief regent for the under-age Lebna Dengel, along with his mother, the Dowager Empress Na'od Mogassa, and Ras Degelhan of Gojjam, the Emperor's senior male relative.\n\nÁlvares also notes that Eleni possessed extensive estates in the province of Gojjam. Others said that \"she was accomplished in everything: in front of God by practising righteousness and having strong faith, by praying and receiving Holy Communion; in worldly terms, she was accomplished in preparing food [for the royal table], in familiarity with the books, in knowledge of the law, and in understanding the affairs of state. For these qualities, the King greatly loved our Queen\nEléni. He considered her like his own mother’.\n\nThe date of Eleni's death is not entirely certain. However, Henze states that she died at an advanced age in the 1520s, and Beckingham and Huntingford confirms this by arguing that the evidence in Álvares account provides enough information to date her death to April, 1522. Álvares makes it clear that she died while he was in Ethiopia, adding that her death was a cause for sorrow by her subjects:\n"}

In 2007, NBC Universal announced it would reduce budgets company-wide, including its Telemundo owned-and-operated station; as part of the cuts, KVDA shut down its news department and replaced its in-house San Antonio-based newscasts with a regional newscast based in a new production center at Dallas sister station KXTX-TV. This move attracted criticism from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, including formal statements against NBC Universal.\n\nOn May 21, 2012, KVDA relaunched in-house news operations with the debut of half-hour evening newscasts at 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. on Mondays through Fridays, that are produced at the station's San Pedro Avenue studios; the locally produced newscasts have been broadcast in high definition from the news department's launch.\n\n\n"}

Bill C16 is properly titled \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The bill adds \"gender identity or expression\" to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code.\n\nThe Liberal Alternative party states: \"We wish to make marriage a private affair, whether religious or not, composed simply of two consenting adults, without regard for sex, and with no further obligation beyond going to the local magistrate/city hall to notify the state about the union. This form of civil union would replace the PACS symbolically. Recognition of marriage is, of course, possible\".\n\nLibertarians stated in their platform that the party \"fully supports the concept of a civil union and would also support allowing marriages between same sex couples, and indeed polygamous marriages or marriages between people who are already related—in all cases as long as all parties are adults and consenting\". The organization ceased to exist in February 2014.\n\nThe Libertarian Party of Russia has been one of the most active vocal opponent of the 2013 Russian law banning propaganda of homosexuality among minors. Libertarian Party activists have participated in a demonstrations in front of the Moscow City Duma against the adoption of the law. At a 2012 picket, the Libertarian Party announced its opposition to homophobic laws restricting people's right to freedom of speech.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists believe in stateless voluntary society, thus oppose any law supporting or opposing LGBT rights. The issue of LGBT rights would be left up individually for people to decide whether to support or oppose LGBT rights. Adam Kokesh argues LGBT people should be anarcho-capitalists.\n\nIn 1972, John Hospers, who was widely believed to be gay (although not openly so), ran for President as the Libertarian Party's first presidential candidate.\n\nIn 1975, Ralph Raico helped to create the Libertarian For Gay Rights caucus within the party and subsequently published \"Gay Rights: A Libertarian Approach\".\n\nThe second LGBT rights organization to operate from a libertarian perspective was the Libertarians for Gay and Lesbian Concerns. The organization held its first national convention in 1985 and sought to promote libertarianism to LGBT Americans.\n\nIn 1998, Outright Libertarians was formed. Outright Libertarians are also affiliated with the Libertarian Party and takes many of the same position that the Libertarians for Gay and Lesbian Concerns did in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2009, the Libertarian Party came out against H.R. 1913, a proposed hate crime bill that would add to the federal hate crime statute the categories of sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. The reason the Libertarian Party opposed the proposed hate crimes bill was because it would violate equal justice under the law by creating different classes of victims for the same crime. The Libertarian Party also accused legislators of attempting to buy the support of the LGBT community while still opposing same-sex marriage and repealing Don't ask, don't tell.\n\nIn 2013, the Libertarian Party applauded the Supreme Court's decision \"United States v. Windsor\" to strike down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as unconstitutional. The Libertarian Party has supported same-sex marriage since its founding in 1971.\n\nThe Libertarian Party takes the following positions relevant to LGBT rights:\n\n\n"}

The story did not reveal any information about the character or provide context with regard to previous stories. \n\nIn the subsequent \"Terror Titans\" miniseries, it is revealed that the second Copperhead's true identity is Nathan Prince, and he is the only member of the Terror Titans who does not have a family connection to his predecessor. As a child, Nathan drowned his baby sibling out of jealousy, and even attempted to kill his parents. Unable to go through with it, he instead ran away to live on the streets, where he would solicit himself, having sex with older men, after which he would kill and rob them. It is still unknown how Prince came to work for Clock King. During The Dark Side Club's metahuman battles, the heroine TNTeena is badly injured, and Clock King tasks Copperhead with watching over her as she recuperates. Copperhead complies, and over time, falls in love with her. However, Nathan is later forced by Clock King to kill her. Nate and the rest of the Terror Titans are then sent to assist the Martyr Militia, a group of brainwashed metahumans, in destroying Los Angeles, but the tables are turned by Ravager and Miss Martian, who uses her telepathy to undo the brainwashing. The Terror Titans flee to their base, only for Clock King to kill Disruptor, and leave them to be apprehended by the metahumans. Two weeks later, Nate breaks his fellow Terror Titans out of custody, and the group swear revenge on Clock King.\n\nCopperhead appears in the New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe). He is a mutated anthropomorphic snake man as opposed to being a villain wearing a snake costume as well as member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. He is killed by Deathstroke in \"Forever Evil\" #5.\n\nA female Copperhead using the alias Jane Doe makes her debut sometime after the death of her predecessor. This version of the character resembles its appearance in \"\", DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns has said that this new incarnation and daughter of Copperhead would appear as a villain in the New 52 after the game's release. Copperhead is described as a deadly hitwoman and one of the two most toxic individuals on the planet (the other being Cheshire).\n\nLarissa Diaz is a South American crime boss in Central City, as well as a former mercenary. She is an antagonist of both Batman and the Flash. Two-Face placed a large bounty on Batman's head that many super-villains and mercenaries intended to collect, including Copperhead. Alongside several other villains Copperhead tracked down the Bat to an active train. Climbing on board the train Copperhead attempted to kill Batman but he was able to escape by jumping into a flowing stream. After a brief stint of assassinations and other mercenary jobs, Copperhead was called up to lead her families' crime business in Central City. After a mysterious rival boss started muscling in on her territory she decided to hire several mercenaries to enforce her rule, two of these mercenaries were Shrapnel and Black Spider. However Black Spider was arrested by the Flash for robbing a diamond exchange, and Shrapnel was arrested after murdering the Road Reapers. Soon after this another pair of mercenaries were apprehended by the Flash- Trigger Twins, this prompted Copperhead to open negotiations with the mysterious crime lord whom she discovered was Captain Cold of the Rogues, in order to find away to defeat the Flash. Copperhead followed Cold's plan to eliminate the Flash, but Cold turned on her when he planted a cold bomb in a weapons delivery. The Flash was able to save her after he apprehended Cold, but without any evidence of her involvement she was allowed to walk free.\n\nAnother Copperhead appears as one of the many villains Batman and Catwoman take down when he takes her on a typical night of his job. This version appears again to be inhuman, with copper skin but with some un-snake-like qualities, such as teeth. They are later shown as one of the many villains in Batman's Rogues Gallery to be beaten down by Bane in his attempt to reach Batman in Arkham. They later take part in a scheme organized by Helena Bertinelli's mother Fenice and are arrested by the Birds of Prey.\n\nCopperhead's contortionist skills allow him to fit himself into incredibly small spaces (such as chimneys). He originally wore a snake-themed costume. The suit was a weave of metallic and elastic fibers and covered vulnerable points (such as the chest) with Kevlar, making it bulletproof and impenetrable to almost any cutting edged weapon. The costume had been treated with a highly slippery water- and heat-proof silicon gel, allowing Copperhead to slide along any surface and slip out of tight spots. The tail could be stretched several feet and was strong enough to snap bone and shatter stone. The suit's helmet contained two seven-inch-long fangs which were capable of piercing human skin, and were coated in a potent neurotoxin derived from copperhead snakes. The toxin could paralyze a person almost instantly, and death would follow within 30 minutes. Later, Copperhead sold his soul to the demon Neron and was transformed into a human-snake hybrid. His reflexes and agility were greatly increased, and he gained venomous fangs, a forked tongue, claws, and a prehensile tail.\n\nIn \"Terror Titans\", Clock King mentions that the second Copperhead does not have any superpowers, meaning he utilizes a snake-themed suit, like the original once did.\n\nThe Copperhead from \"The New 52\" has snake-like abilities.\n\nThe female Copperhead does not appear to have any superpowers and instead uses different poison equipment such as darts in addition to being a skilled martial artist.\n\nA different version of Copperhead appears in Sensation Comics #15\n(March, 1943). This version is an enemy of Little Boy Blue.\n\nA kid version of Copperhead named Johnny appears in Tiny Titans comics.\n\nAnother Copperhead appears in \"\" #10 (March, 2013) resembling the classic version is seen with Amanda Waller's Task Force X.\n\nIn the \"Injustice\" series, Copperhead is a Suicide Squad criminal who obeys Wonder Woman and the regime. She first appears in the Injustice vs Masters of the Universe crossover.\n\nThe original Copperhead appears in Batman '66 Meets Wonder Woman '77 #5 (July, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2021321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021321", "title": "Marshall–Lerner condition", "text": "Marshall–Lerner condition\n\nThe Marshall–Lerner condition (after Alfred Marshall and Abba P. Lerner) is satisfied if the absolute sum of a country's export and import demand elasticities (demand responsiveness to price) is greater than one. If it is satisfied, then if a country begins with a zero trade deficit then when the country's currency depreciates (e.g., it takes fewer yen to buy a dollar), its balance of trade will improve (e.g., the U.S. will develop a trade surplus with Japan). \nThe country's imports become more expensive and exports become cheaper due to the change in relative prices, and the Marshall-Lerner condition implies that the indirect effect on the quantity of trade will exceed the direct effect of the country having to pay a higher price for its imports and receive a lower price for its exports. \n\nSuppose the U.S. exports 100 million tons of goods to Japan at a price of $1/ton and imports 100 million tons at a price of 100 yen/ton and an exchange rate of $.01/yen, so the trade balance is zero, $100 million of goods going each way. Then the dollar depreciates by 10%, so the exchange rate is $.011/yen. The immediate effect is to hurt the U.S. trade balance because if the quantities of imports and exports stay the same the value of exports is still $100 million but imports will now cost $110 million, a trade deficit of $10 million. It takes time for consumers around the world to adapt and change their quantities demanded; the shorter the time frame, the less elastic is demand. In the long run, consumers react more to changed prices: demand is more elastic the longer the time frame. Japanese consumers will react to the cheaper dollar by buying more American goods-- say, a 6% increase to 106 million tons for $105 million-- and American consumers will react to the more expensive yen by buying less Japanese goods-- say, a 10% decline to 90 million tons for $99 million, creating a trade surplus of $14 million. This example has an elasticity of Japanese demand for American exports of .6 (= 6%/10%) and elasticity of demand for American imports of -1 (= -10%/10%), so it satisfies the Marshall-Lerner condition that the sum of the magnitudes of the elasticities (|-.6| + |1|) exceeds 1. The direct negative price effect of the depreciation on the balance of trade is outweighed by the indirect positive quantity effect. This pattern of a short run worsening of the trade balance after depreciation or devaluation of the currency (because the short-run elasticities add up to less than one) and long run improvement (because the long-run elasticities add up to more than one) is known as the J-curve effect. \n\nEssentially, the Marshall–Lerner condition is an extension of Marshall's theory of the price elasticity of demand to foreign trade, the analog to the idea that if demand facing seller is elastic he can increase his revenue by reducing his price. \n\nNormalize domestic and foreign prices in their own currencies to each equal 1. Let \"X\" and \"M\" denote the quantities of exports and imports and \"e\" denote the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency. The trade surplus in domestic currency (dollars in this equation) is dollar exports minus dollar imports: \nor more simply, eliminating the units and putting everything into dollars, \nThe derivative of \"Surplus\" with respect to the exchange rate \"e\" is \nMultiplying and dividing by \"M\" we get \nSince the elasticity of Y with respect to Y is (dY/dX)(X/Y), we can write this in terms of the elasticities of demand of exports and imports, formula_5 and formula_6.\nSubtract and add \"eM\" to the numerator of the first term to get\n\nIf the value of exports minus imports equals zero so the trade surplus is \"X - eM = 0\", the last equation simplifies to \nso the trade surplus rises if the absolute values of the two elasticities add to more than 1, which is the Marshall-Lerner condition. \n\nIf the initial trade surplus is positive so \"X - eM > 0\", the sum of the magnitudes of the elasticities can be less than 1 and the depreciation can still improve the balance of trade, resulting in an even bigger surplus than initially. That happens because when X is bigger than EM, a smaller value of formula_10 will still result in a big effect on the value of X; the smaller percentage increase from formula_11 still has a big effect when X is big. Similarly, if the economy starts out with a trade deficit and \"X - eM < 0\", the elasticities have to add up to more than 1 for depreciation to improve the balance of trade, because the initial harmful price effect is bigger, so the quantity responses have to be bigger to compensate. Suppose initially the US exports 60 million tons of goods to Japan and imports 100 million tons of other goods under an exchange rate of $.01/yen and prices of $1/ton and 100 yen/ton, for a trade deficit of $40 million. The initial effect of dollar depreciation to $.011/yen is to make imports cost $110 million, and the deficit rises to $50 million. If the long-run export and import elasticities equal .5 and -.5, exports will rise 5% to $63 million and imports will fall 5% to $104.5 million. The long-run result is a trade deficit of $41.5 million, smaller than the short-run deficit but bigger than the original deficit of $40 million before the depreciation.\n\nNote that a common source of confusion is the price used in the elasticities, which determines whether an elasticity is positive or negative. Demand elasticities are ordinarily the elasticity of demand for sa good with respect to the price of the good, and they ordinarily are negative numbers. Here, we have been using the elasticity of demand with respect to the exchange rate--- defined as domestic/foreign ($e/yen). For domestic consumers, when the exchange rate rises, imports are more expensive, so they buy less and we see a negative elasticity, the usual result. For foreign consumers, when the exchange rate rises, the exports they buy are cheaper for them and they buy more, so we see a positive elasticity. This is not an upward sloping demand curve; their price has actually fallen. For American consumers the price of imports from Japan is $e/yen, but for Japanese consumers the price of exports from America is yen/($e). \n"}

The gardens were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1984.\n\nThe Public Gardens encompass 16 acres and are bounded by Spring Garden Road, South Park Street, Summer Street and Sackville Street. They are open annually from approximately May 1 until November 1. The landscaping style is Victorian formal and provides a popular setting for wedding and prom photos. In addition to statues and extensive flower beds, there are three fountains, two stone bridges, three ponds (one large and two small), and a small concession building (located in the original Horticultural Hall). The gardens also feature a bandstand that is used for free public concerts on Sunday afternoons during the summer. There are celebrations in the gardens every year on Canada Day (July 1) and Natal Day (the first Monday in August).\n\nIn the past, many people enjoyed feeding the ducks who make the gardens their home, although it is now prohibited.\n\nThe Public Gardens were badly damaged by Hurricane Juan in 2003. Many trees were destroyed, necessitating the early closure of the gardens and some redesign.

Fortunately, a number of old trees survived the hurricane, including an American elm that dates back to the 1860s.\n\nThe Halifax Public Gardens was established in 1874 by the amalgamation of two older gardens, the Nova Scotia Horticultural Society Garden (laid out in 1837) and an adjacent public park (opened in 1866). In 1872, Richard Power was hired as the park's superintendent. He introduced an axially symmetrical plan which governs the overall design of the site. Over the years, he oversaw the introduction of the bandstand (designed by architect Henry Busch), fountains, statues, and wrought iron gates as well as establishing the bedding out of annuals in highly designed carpet beds, redesigned Griffin's Pond and introduced water fowl.\n\nThe gardens were designated a National Historic Site in 1984, and a Municipally Registered Property under the Heritage Property Act in 1991.\n\nThere are various plaques throughout the Gardens commemorating historic military figures and operations during the Victorian era and early twentieth century. There is a commemorative plaque for the Halifax Provisional Battalion (1785) which served in the North West Rebellion. The wrought-iron gates were erected as a tribute to the Halifax Provisional Battalion. In 1898 a plaque was created for Nova Scotian Clonard Keating of the Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment who died in Nigeria prior to the Second Boer War. There is also a statue of a soldier from the Canadian Mounted Rifles (renamed the Royal Canadian Dragoons) who fought in the Second Boer War by renowned sculptor Hamilton MacCarthy (who also created South African War Memorial (Halifax) and the sculpture to Harold Lothrop Borden in Canning, Nova Scotia). A tree was also planted in memory of the first Canadian casualty of the Boer War, Charles Carroll Wood. There is also a bridge that commemorates Nova Scotian Francis Joseph Fitzgerald of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police who died in the \"Lost Patrol\".\n\nThere are two plaques to prominent members of the Temperance movement of the 1930s. One such plaque is for a flowerbed dedicated to renowned suffragist Frances Willard by the local Woman's Christian Temperance Union on the centennial of her birth (1939). Willard was instrumental in passing the 18th and 19th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The 19th Amendment permitted women to vote in the U.S., and the 18th forbade the use of alcoholic beverage. Willard was the president of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union for 19 years (1879–1897). Another plaque is to mark a tree than was planted for renowned temperance crusader John Bartholomew Gough by the Sons of Temperance and the Rosebud Band of Hope, the latter group being the children's wing of the. Sons of Temperance society (1936). Gough wrote about visiting Halifax:\n\nIn 1887 (the same year that the Bandstand was built), the estate of chief justice Sir William Young, donated three statues from Roman mythology and six urns from his own garden, to the Halifax Public Gardens. Ceres, the Roman goddess representing agriculture and fertility; Flora the goddess of flowers and spring, and Diana the goddess of the woodland and wild animals, all reside along the Petit Allée. The six urns were placed around the Bandstand within the ‘floating beds’. Griffin Pond, on which floats a model of the Titanic, is named after a young Irishman Frederick Griffin.

Catherine Keener and Paul Rudd also star. The screenplay features a great deal of improvised dialogue. The film was released theatrically in North America on August 19, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $177 million worldwide.\n\nAndy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin who lives alone, his apartment filled with his collection of action figures and video games. At a poker game with his co-workers David, Cal, Mooj and Jay, when conversation turns to past sexual exploits, they learn that Andy is still a virgin, and resolve to help him lose his virginity.\n\nThe men give Andy various and sometimes contradictory pieces of advice, both on his appearance and how to interact with women. Cal advises Andy to simply \"ask questions\", which he practices on attractive bookstore clerk Beth, who quickly becomes intrigued by him. David gives Andy his porn collection, encouraging him to masturbate. Mooj stresses to Andy the importance of love in a relationship.\n\nAndy begins to socialize and form friendships with his co-workers. David, after running into his ex-girlfriend Amy, has an emotional breakdown at work.

Andy takes Marla to a group session at a sexual health clinic, where she reveals she is a virgin. Andy, trying to defend her against derision, admits that he is also a virgin but is disbelieved and ridiculed. Marla later says that she knows Andy is a virgin, but agrees to let him tell Trish himself.\n\nOn the couple's twentieth date, the limit they agreed for their abstinence, Andy is still resistant, which upsets Trish. Trish demands he explain his reticence, and Andy accuses her of trying to change him against his will. He leaves for a nightclub where he meets his friends, gets drunk and praises them for encouraging him to have sex. Andy runs into Beth and they soon leave for her apartment. Marla convinces Trish to make up with Andy. By this time, Andy has sobered up and is having second thoughts. His friends arrive and encourage him to go back to Trish.\n\nAndy returns to his apartment, where he finds Trish waiting for him. He attempts to apologize, but Trish, having found some of David's porn videos in his apartment, is now afraid that Andy may be some sort of sexual deviant. Andy tries to defend himself and declares his love for her, but she leaves in alarm and disgust. Andy chases after her on his bike, but collides with her car and flies through the side of a billboard truck. Trish rushes to his side, and Andy confides that he is a virgin as explanation for his behavior. Trish is surprised but relieved, and they kiss.\n\nLater, Andy and Trish are married in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, with a sidelong mention that Andy's action figures sold for over half a million dollars. Afterwards, they consummate the marriage, which transitions into a musical scene where the characters sing and dance to \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\".\n\nIn addition, Jonah Hill, Kevin Hart and Wayne Federman appear as eBay and Smart Tech customers, respectively. Mindy Kaling plays David's ex at the speed dating event, where WCW wrestler Kimberly Page exposes her breast. Gillian Vigman and Page play Woman Speed Datings. Stormy Daniels has a cameo as herself. Nancy Carell, Steve's wife, plays the health clinic counselor. Cedric Yarbrough and David Koechner appear as Dads at Health Clinic, Steve Bannos plays Father at Restaurant and Jenna Fischer plays Woman #1.\n\nThe film is based on a sketch Carell created while performing with the improv comedy troupe, Second City. Carell did many versions of the sketch, trying out different scenarios where the 40-year-old man is hiding a \"big secret.\"\nApatow had difficulty coming up with the ending for the film. Garry Shandling suggested it was important to show that Andy was having better sex because he was in love, and instead of directly showing the sex they decided to have Andy sing and have a musical number.\nApatow started casting the film early in the development process and having no preconceptions about the friends and workers in the store was able to tailor the script to the strengths of the actors. Catherine Keener was the first choice for the female lead.\n\nProduction started on January 17, 2005, and wrapped on April 1, 2005. Production on the film was halted by Universal Pictures after the first week, due to concerns that the physical appearance of Carell's character resembled that of a serial killer, and that the early footage was not funny. Paul Rudd was criticized for being overweight and the studio was unhappy with how Apatow was \"lighting [the film] like an indie\". Universal had also refused to allow Apatow to cast Jason Segel in the film.\n\nThe chest waxing scene was done for real, with five cameras set up to capture the moment.\nThe production used over a million feet of film, a milestone reached on the last day of filming and recognized with free champagne by Technicolor. Using the conversion of 90 feet of film per minute, this means that the shooting ratio for the film is 96:1 (96 feet shot for each foot used in the release after editing) for the theatrical version (84:1 for the unrated version).\n\nThe American Humane Association withheld its \"no animals were harmed...\" disclaimer due to the accidental deaths of several tropical fish used in the film.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 186 reviews, with an average rating of 7.18/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Steve Carell's first star turn scores big with a tender treatment of its titular underdog, using raunchy but realistically funny comedy to connect with adult audiences.\" Rotten Tomatoes declared it the \"Best Reviewed Comedy of 2005.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nEbert and Roeper gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Roger Ebert said, \"I was surprised by how funny, how sweet, and how wise the movie really is\" and \"the more you think about it, the better \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" gets.\" The pair gave minor criticisms, with Ebert describing \"the way she (Catherine Keener as 'Trish') empathizes with Andy\" as \"almost too sweet to be funny\" and Richard Roeper saying that the film was too long, and at times extremely frustrating. Roeper later chose the film as the tenth best of 2005. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the movie an A-, saying that Carell \"plays him [Andy] in the funniest and most surprising way possible: as a credible human being.\" Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"charmingly bent comedy,\" noting that Carell conveys a \"sheer likability\" and a \"range as an actor\" that was \"crucial to making this film work as well as it does.\" Emanuel Levy gave the film a B+ grade calling it \"Raunchier and funnier than \"Wedding Crashers\", this is an R-rated comedy that despite crude surface and foul lingo has a generous heart and a sweet, almost naive center.\"\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" wrote: \"Crude, sophomorically homophobic but frequently funny, pic also overstays its welcome a bit and indulges in some juvenile excesses. All told, though, The 40 Year Old Virgin delivers enough belly laughs.\" Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, and called it \"A calculating crowd-pleaser aimed squarely at the under-25 crowd, who can feel free to add a star or two to my rating.\" Ann Hornaday of the \"Washington Post\" is critical of the film but praised Carell for his performance: \"the most surprising thing about \"'The 40-Year-Old Virgin\"' may be that despite the flagrantly exploitative and gratuitous efforts of his friends, Andy remains steadfastly chaste and genuinely humane. [...] Carell has succeeded in creating a character of old-fashioned decency in a movie that otherwise flouts it at every turn.\"\n\nThe film was criticized by Harry Forbes of Catholic News Service for promoting \"the false premise that there's something intrinsically wrong with an unmarried man being sexually inexperienced,\" and by political columnist Cal Thomas for being an example of societal decline in regards to \"self-control or what was once known as purity.\"\n\nThe film was a summer hit, and opened at No. 1 at the box office, grossing $21,422,815 during its opening weekend, and stayed at No. 1 the following weekend. The film grossed a total of $109,449,237 at the domestic market, and $67,929,408 internationally, for a total of $177,378,645. The film was 25th in global gross, and 19th in the United States that year. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 2, 2005, and topped the country's box office that weekend.\n\nIn December 2005, the film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best movies of the year, the only comedy film to be so recognized (though the comedy-drama \"The Squid and the Whale\" was also chosen). The film was also ranked No. 30 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\".\n\nOn home video, the film was released with an additional 17 minutes under the banner \"unrated\". For the \"100th Anniversary of Universal\" the theatrical edition was released on Blu-ray. This version also had a similar banner of \"unrated\".\n\n\n"}

The progenitors of the MacFirbis family descend from Amhailgadh, whose brothers included Fiachra Ealg (ancestor of O'Dowd) and Eocha Breac (ancestor of O'Shaughnessy).\n\nBased initially at Cong, the family may have been erenaghs prior to becoming historians and genealogists to the Ui Fiachrach Muaidhe (branch of the Uí Fiachrach based in north Connacht) and several other patrons. While this was their main function, they also appear to have served as poets and brehons to their patrons, possibly even musicians.\n\nAmong the earliest known members of the family were Amhlaoibh Mór mac Fir Bhisigh (died 1138), Domhnall na Sgoile Mac Fir Bhisigh (fl.c. 1250) and Gilla Isa Mac Fir Bisigh, who died in 1301.\n\nIn the late medieval era the most well known was Giolla Íosa Mór Mac Fhirbhisigh fl. 1390–1418. \nThe Mac Fhirbhisigh, long after moving to Lecan (Lacken), Tireragh, built Lacken Castle (Castle Forbes, ), now ruined, in Kilglass parish in 1560.

Early projects ranged from furniture to medical instruments and from consumer electronics and transportation interiors to complex air traffic and automated control systems workstation designs. Nuovo's work with Nokia began as a consultant in 1989 while continuing work at Designworks/USA in Agoura. After many successful projects for Nokia, in 1995 he began working for Nokia full-time, setting up Nokia's first dedicated industrial design and styling group and center in Los Angeles, California. Over the next decade (1995 to 2006) Nuovo led the creation of Nokia's first global design team, which, during his administration, included additional design centers in Finland and England, and also included remote design teams in Denmark, China, Japan, Germany and other locations in the USA.\n\nDuring his time at Nokia, Nuovo was responsible for leading design strategy for what can be considered one of the most successful stories of growth and success in modern history. Innovations there combine technology, usability and style with user centered design. Examples include the Nokia 101 (1992), Nokia 8110 (1996), Nokia 3210 (1999) and Nokia 3310 (2000). Nuovo and his team helped Nokia capture market share that maintained global leadership at levels more than twice that of the nearest competitor's global market share. While at Nokia, Nuovo was very active in brand development and renewal resulting in Nokia's position as the world's 6th most valuable brand (Interbrand).\n\nInspired by trend research experiences gained while at Designworks/USA, Nuovo led the creation of a colors and materials and graphics research group within Nokia Design. In 2005, with Nuovo's vision of a new type of color and trend design research lab, and with substantial funding and support from Nokia, a crucial collaboration was formed with Art Center College of Design's Karen Hoffman and Martin Smith. This collaboration finally resulted in creation of The Art Center College of Design's Color Materials and Trends Lab (CMTEL).\n\nSignificantly during this period, in late 1997, Nuovo first formally proposed the creation of a luxury mobile phone brand, which eventually became known as Vertu. Working alongside his associate of many years, Dr. Peter Ashall, a full business case and go to market proposal was prepared, and then, in 1998 was accepted with funding and core technology supplied by Nokia. While maintaining duties as Nokia Design's Vice President and Chief Designer, Nuovo also led the creative development of the Vertu brand identity and product portfolio as Creative Director and Principal Designer. Vertu launched to the public in Paris in January 2002.\n\nIn late 2005, as Vertu was gaining momentum and profitability in the new luxury mobile phone market the company had pioneered, Nuovo began planning to leave his position at Nokia in order to focus on Vertu's success. Upon his departure from Nokia in April 2006, he maintained a role as Principal Designer at Vertu with concentration on the development of the Vertu brand and product portfolio - until his departure from Vertu in 2012. Additionally, Nuovo opened his own design studio in Southern California called Design Studio Nuovo, which he operates with his designer wife and business partner, Trina Nuovo. Design Studio Nuovo is where Nuovo is developing new ventures with technology and manufacturing partners from around the world including state of the art augmented reality ID, UI and UX solutions.\n\nNuovo left Nokia while on a continuing upward corporate performance trend. With financials as reported by Nokia, during Nuovo's last quarter, Nokia reported a 21% rise in first-quarter net profit due to strong performances at its mobile-phone and multimedia divisions. The world's largest cell phone maker stated sales rose 29% and its market share rose by three percentage points, from a year earlier, to 35%. At that point, the products designed by his team were manufactured at a rate of over four hundred million units per year. After departure from Nokia, Nuovo's portfolio legacy contributed positively to what was a continuing upward trend with Nokia gaining to a 38% market share with net sales rising 28% through to the second quarter of 2007.\n\nNuovo graduated with a bachelor of science in industrial design from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena in 1986. In December 2008, The Art Center College of Design honored Nuovo with the prestigious Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award. Additionally, The Art Center presented Nuovo with a doctorate of science degree in recognition of his life's work in the field of Industrial Design.\n\nNuovo's design and innovation leadership has resulted in dozens of major awards and accolades around the world for him, and for his associates at Nokia and Vertu. These awards include several of Germany's highly sought-after Red Dot and IF awards and American IDEA awards among many others. Nuovo's work and that of his design teams have been featured in museums around the world including the Museum of Modern Art “Workspheres” (New York), and the Neues Museum Nürnberg Sammlung Design, The Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum permanent collection and as part of the design triennial and also the Essen Design Museum, Essen, Germany.\n\nNuovo is an active lecturer at many international technical, marketing and design conferences, and academic venues around the world. Nuovo's life's work and story has been featured in many regional and international publications and television shows globally.\n"}

He was known for his advocacy on intellectual property matters as well as his involvement in intellectual property organizations throughout his career. He served as president of the Canadian Bar Association and was a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nHenderson was born in Ottawa, Ontario on April 17, 1912. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1934 and graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1937.\n\nUpon his call to the bar, Henderson joined the firm of Henderson & Herridge (which later became Gowling Lafleur Henderson). Within 3 years, and before the age of 28, Henderson had appeared successfully on two separate occasions at the Supreme Court of Canada. Throughout his career, Henderson developed a reputation for litigation in all areas of law, especially in intellectual property. Ian Scott, former Attorney General of Ontario, called him \"the best all-round lawyer the profession has produced since the War.\" By the time of his death, Henderson appeared as counsel in nearly 400 reported cases, including 90 before the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nHenderson was also an active participant in professional associations both within and outside the legal community. He was heavily involved in the Intellectual Property Institute of Canada and was the president of the Canadian Bar Association from 1979 to 1980.\n\nHenderson was instrumental in the formation of SOCAN, a major Canadian copyright collective, as its lawyer and later as Chairman. In addition, he helped found the Canadian Law Information Council.\n\nHe was also the founding editor of the Canadian Patent Reporter (CPR) (which he started in 1941). The CPR was one of the first continuous case reporters for Canadian intellectual property law decisions, and remains a leading reporter today. For most of its existence, Henderson wrote virtually every headnote and comment in the publication.\n\nIn his later years, Henderson served on the Board of Governors of the University of Ottawa, and from 1991 until his death in 1993, he was Chancellor of the university.\n\nIn 1977, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1988. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and the Law Society of Upper Canada. He also served as Honorary Consul to Liberia in Canada, a position that brought diplomatic privileges. He also received the B'nai B'rith Award of Merit.\n\nHenderson was a philanthropist, humanitarian and civic leader in his native Ottawa, having founded or lent his support to numerous causes. He was the founder of the Community Foundation of Ottawa and the Ottawa School Breakfasts Program. His decades of service to the University of Ottawa Heart Institute Foundation were recognized by the establishment of the Gordon F.

{"id": "2021419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021419", "title": "Relativistic mechanics", "text": "Relativistic mechanics\n\nIn physics, relativistic mechanics refers to mechanics compatible with special relativity (SR) and general relativity (GR). It provides a non-quantum mechanical description of a system of particles, or of a fluid, in cases where the velocities of moving objects are comparable to the speed of light \"c\". As a result, classical mechanics is extended correctly to particles traveling at high velocities and energies, and provides a consistent inclusion of electromagnetism with the mechanics of particles. This was not possible in Galilean relativity, where it would be permitted for particles and light to travel at \"any\" speed, including faster than light. The foundations of relativistic mechanics are the postulates of special relativity and general relativity. The unification of SR with quantum mechanics is relativistic quantum mechanics, while attempts for that of GR is quantum gravity, an unsolved problem in physics.\n\nAs with classical mechanics, the subject can be divided into \"kinematics\"; the description of motion by specifying positions, velocities and accelerations, and \"dynamics\"; a full description by considering energies, momenta, and angular momenta and their conservation laws, and forces acting on particles or exerted by particles. There is however a subtlety; what appears to be \"moving\" and what is \"at rest\"—which is termed by \"statics\" in classical mechanics—depends on the relative motion of observers who measure in frames of reference.\n\nAlthough some definitions and concepts from classical mechanics do carry over to SR, such as force as the time derivative of momentum (Newton's second law), the work done by a particle as the line integral of force exerted on the particle along a path, and power as the time derivative of work done, there are a number of significant modifications to the remaining definitions and formulae. SR states that motion is relative and the laws of physics are the same for all experimenters irrespective of their inertial reference frames. In addition to modifying notions of space and time, SR forces one to reconsider the concepts of mass, momentum, and energy all of which are important constructs in Newtonian mechanics. SR shows that these concepts are all different aspects of the same physical quantity in much the same way that it shows space and time to be interrelated. Consequently, another modification is the concept of the center of mass of a system, which is straightforward to define in classical mechanics but much less obvious in relativity – see relativistic center of mass for details.\n\nThe equations become more complicated in the more familiar three-dimensional vector calculus formalism, due to the nonlinearity in the Lorentz factor, which accurately accounts for relativistic velocity dependence and the speed limit of all particles and fields. However, they have a simpler and elegant form in \"four\"-dimensional spacetime, which includes flat Minkowski space (SR) and curved spacetime (GR), because three-dimensional vectors derived from space and scalars derived from time can be collected into four vectors, or four-dimensional tensors. However, the six component angular momentum tensor is sometimes called a bivector because in the 3D viewpoint it is two vectors (one of these, the conventional angular momentum, being an axial vector).\n\nThe relativistic four-velocity, that is the four-vector representing velocity in relativity, is defined as follows:\n\nIn the above, formula_2 is the proper time of the path through spacetime, called the world-line, followed by the object velocity the above represents, and\n\nis the four-position; the coordinates of an event. Due to time dilation, the proper time is the time between two events in a frame of reference where they take place at the same location. The proper time is related to coordinate time \"t\" by:\n\nwhere formula_5 is the Lorentz factor:\n\n(either version may be quoted) so it follows:\n\nThe first three terms, excepting the factor of formula_8, is the velocity as seen by the observer in their own reference frame. The formula_8 is determined by the velocity formula_10 between the observer's reference frame and the object's frame, which is the frame in which its proper time is measured. This quantity is invariant under Lorentz transformation, so to check to see what an observer in a different reference frame sees, one simply multiplies the velocity four-vector by the Lorentz transformation matrix between the two reference frames.\n\nThere are a couple of (equivalent) ways to define momentum and energy in SR. One method uses conservation laws. If these laws are to remain valid in SR they must be true in every possible reference frame. However, if one does some simple thought experiments using the Newtonian definitions of momentum and energy, one sees that these quantities are not conserved in SR. One can rescue the idea of conservation by making some small modifications to the definitions to account for relativistic velocities. It is these new definitions which are taken as the correct ones for momentum and energy in SR.\n\nThe four-momentum of an object is straightforward, identical in form to the classical momentum, but replacing 3-vectors with 4-vectors:\n\nThe energy and momentum of an object with invariant mass \"m\" (also called \"rest mass\"), moving with velocity v with respect to a given frame of reference, are respectively given by\n\nThe factor of γ(v) comes from the definition of the four-velocity described above. The appearance of the γ factor has an alternative way of being stated, explained in the next section.\n\nThe kinetic energy, \"K\", is defined as\n\nAnd the speed as a function of kinetic energy is given by\n\nThe quantity\n\nis often called the \"relativistic mass\" of the object in the given frame of reference.\n\nThis makes the relativistic relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial momentum look identical. However, this can be misleading, as it is \"not\" appropriate in special relativity in \"all\" circumstances. For instance, kinetic energy and force in special relativity can not be written exactly like their classical analogues by only replacing the mass with the relativistic mass. Moreover, under Lorentz transformations, this relativistic mass is not invariant, while the rest mass is. For this reason many people find it easier use the rest mass (thereby introduce γ through the 4-velocity or coordinate time), and discard the concept of relativistic mass.\n\nLev B. Okun suggested that \"this terminology ... has no rational justification today\", and should no longer be taught.\n\nOther physicists, including Wolfgang Rindler and T. R. Sandin, have argued that relativistic mass is a useful concept and there is little reason to stop using it.\nSee mass in special relativity for more information on this debate.\n\nSome authors use \"m\" for relativistic mass and \"m\" for rest mass, others simply use \"m\" for rest mass. This article uses the former convention for clarity.\n\nThe energy and momentum of an object with invariant mass \"m\" are related by the formulas\n\nThe first is referred to as the \"relativistic energy–momentum relation\". It can be derived by considering that formula_18 can be written as formula_19 where the denominator can be written as formula_20. Now, gamma can be replaced in the expression of energy.\nWhile the energy \"E\" and the momentum p depend on the frame of reference in which they are measured, the quantity \"E\" − (\"pc\") is invariant, and arises as −\"c\" times the squared magnitude of the 4-momentum vector which is −(\"m\"\"c\").\n\nThe invariant mass of a system\nis different from the sum of the rest masses of the particles of which it is composed due to kinetic energy and binding energy. Rest mass is not a conserved quantity in special relativity unlike the situation in Newtonian physics. However, even if an object is changing internally, so long as it does not exchange energy with surroundings, then its rest mass will not change, and can be calculated with the same result in any frame of reference.\n\nA particle whose rest mass is zero is called \"massless\". Photons and gravitons are thought to be massless; and neutrinos are nearly so.\n\nThe relativistic energy–momentum equation holds for all particles, even for massless particles for which \"m\" = 0. In this case:\n\nWhen substituted into \"Ev\" = \"c\"\"p\", this gives \"v\" = \"c\": massless particles (such as photons) always travel at the speed of light.\n\nNotice that the rest mass of a composite system will generally be slightly different from the sum of the rest masses of its parts since, in its rest frame, their kinetic energy will increase its mass and their (negative) binding energy will decrease its mass. In particular, a hypothetical \"box of light\" would have rest mass even though made of particles which do not since their momenta would cancel.\n\nLooking at the above formula for invariant mass of a system, one sees that, when a single massive object is at rest (v = 0, p = 0), there is a non-zero mass remaining: \"m\" = \"E\"/\"c\".\nThe corresponding energy, which is also the total energy when a single particle is at rest, is referred to as \"rest energy\". In systems of particles which are seen from a moving inertial frame, total energy increases and so does momentum. However, for single particles the rest mass remains constant, and for systems of particles the invariant mass remain constant, because in both cases, the energy and momentum increases subtract from each other, and cancel. Thus, the invariant mass of systems of particles is a calculated constant for all observers, as is the rest mass of single particles.\n\nFor systems of particles, the energy–momentum equation requires summing the momentum vectors of the particles:\n\nThe inertial frame in which the momenta of all particles sums to zero is called the center of momentum frame. In this special frame, the relativistic energy–momentum equation has p = 0, and thus gives the invariant mass of the system as merely the total energy of all parts of the system, divided by \"c\"\n\nThis is the invariant mass of any system which is measured in a frame where it has zero total momentum, such as a bottle of hot gas on a scale. In such a system, the mass which the scale weighs is the invariant mass, and it depends on the total energy of the system. It is thus more than the sum of the rest masses of the molecules, but also includes all the totaled energies in the system as well. Like energy and momentum, the invariant mass of isolated systems cannot be changed so long as the system remains totally closed (no mass or energy allowed in or out), because the total relativistic energy of the system remains constant so long as nothing can enter or leave it.\n\nAn increase in the energy of such a system which is caused by translating the system to an inertial frame which is not the center of momentum frame, causes an increase in energy and momentum without an increase in invariant mass. \"E\" = \"m\"\"c\", however, applies only to isolated systems in their center-of-momentum frame where momentum sums to zero.\n\nTaking this formula at face value, we see that in relativity, mass is simply energy by another name (and measured in different units). In 1927 Einstein remarked about special relativity, \"Under this theory mass is not an unalterable magnitude, but a magnitude dependent on (and, indeed, identical with) the amount of energy.\"\n\nIn a \"totally-closed\" system (i.e., isolated system) the total energy, the total momentum, and hence the total invariant mass are conserved. Einstein's formula for change in mass translates to its simplest Δ\"E\" = Δ\"mc\" form, however, only in non-closed systems in which energy is allowed to escape (for example, as heat and light), and thus invariant mass is reduced. Einstein's equation shows that such systems must lose mass, in accordance with the above formula, in proportion to the energy they lose to the surroundings. Conversely, if one can measure the differences in mass between a system before it undergoes a reaction which releases heat and light, and the system after the reaction when heat and light have escaped, one can estimate the amount of energy which escapes the system.\n\nIn both nuclear and chemical reactions, such energy represents the difference in binding energies of electrons in atoms (for chemistry) or between nucleons in nuclei (in atomic reactions). In both cases, the mass difference between reactants and (cooled) products measures the mass of heat and light which will escape the reaction, and thus (using the equation) give the equivalent energy of heat and light which may be emitted if the reaction proceeds.\n\nIn chemistry, the mass differences associated with the emitted energy are around 10 of the molecular mass. However, in nuclear reactions the energies are so large that they are associated with mass differences, which can be estimated in advance, if the products and reactants have been weighed (atoms can be weighed indirectly by using atomic masses, which are always the same for each nuclide). Thus, Einstein's formula becomes important when one has measured the masses of different atomic nuclei. By looking at the difference in masses, one can predict which nuclei have stored energy that can be released by certain nuclear reactions, providing important information which was useful in the development of nuclear energy and, consequently, the nuclear bomb. Historically, for example, Lise Meitner was able to use the mass differences in nuclei to estimate that there was enough energy available to make nuclear fission a favorable process. The implications of this special form of Einstein's formula have thus made it one of the most famous equations in all of science.\n\nThe equation \"E\" = \"m\"\"c\" applies only to isolated systems in their center of momentum frame. It has been popularly misunderstood to mean that mass may be \"converted\" to energy, after which the \"mass\" disappears. However, popular explanations of the equation as applied to systems include open (non-isolated) systems for which heat and light are allowed to escape, when they otherwise would have contributed to the mass (invariant mass) of the system.\n\nHistorically, confusion about mass being \"converted\" to energy has been aided by confusion between mass and \"matter\", where matter is defined as fermion particles. In such a definition, electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy (or heat) are not considered \"matter\". In some situations, matter may indeed be converted to non-matter forms of energy (see above), but in all these situations, the matter and non-matter forms of energy still retain their original mass.\n\nFor isolated systems (closed to all mass and energy exchange), mass never disappears in the center of momentum frame, because energy cannot disappear. Instead, this equation, in context, means only that when any energy is added to, or escapes from, a system in the center-of-momentum frame, the system will be measured as having gained or lost mass, in proportion to energy added or removed. Thus, in theory, if an atomic bomb were placed in a box strong enough to hold its blast, and detonated upon a scale, the mass of this closed system would not change, and the scale would not move. Only when a transparent \"window\" was opened in the super-strong plasma-filled box, and light and heat were allowed to escape in a beam, and the bomb components to cool, would the system lose the mass associated with the energy of the blast. In a 21 kiloton bomb, for example, about a gram of light and heat is created. If this heat and light were allowed to escape, the remains of the bomb would lose a gram of mass, as it cooled. In this thought-experiment, the light and heat carry away the gram of mass, and would therefore deposit this gram of mass in the objects that absorb them.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the time-varying mass moment\n\nand orbital 3-angular momentum\n\nof a point-like particle are combined into a four-dimensional bivector in terms of the 4-position X and the 4-momentum P of the particle:\n\nwhere ∧ denotes the exterior product. This tensor is additive: the total angular momentum of a system is the sum of the angular momentum tensors for each constituent of the system. So, for an assembly of discrete particles one sums the angular momentum tensors over the particles, or integrates the density of angular momentum over the extent of a continuous mass distribution.\n\nEach of the six components forms a conserved quantity when aggregated with the corresponding components for other objects and fields.\n\nIn special relativity, Newton's second law does not hold in the form F = \"m\"a, but it does if it is expressed as\nwhere p = γ(v)\"m\"v is the momentum as defined above and \"m\" is the invariant mass. Thus, the force is given by\n\nConsequently, in some old texts, γ(v)\"m\" is referred to as the \"longitudinal mass\", and γ(v)\"m\" is referred to as the \"transverse mass\", which is numerically the same as the relativistic mass. See mass in special relativity.\n\nIf one inverts this to calculate acceleration from force, one gets\n\nThe force described in this section is the classical 3-D force which is not a four-vector. This 3-D force is the appropriate concept of force since it is the force which obeys Newton's third law of motion. It should not be confused with the so-called four-force which is merely the 3-D force in the comoving frame of the object transformed as if it were a four-vector. However, the density of 3-D force (linear momentum transferred per unit four-volume) \"is\" a four-vector (density of weight +1) when combined with the negative of the density of power transferred.\n\nThe torque acting on a point-like particle is defined as the derivative of the angular momentum tensor given above with respect to proper time:\n\nor in tensor components:\n\nwhere F is the 4d force acting on the particle at the event X. As with angular momentum, torque is additive, so for an extended object one sums or integrates over the distribution of mass.\n\nThe \"work-energy theorem\" says the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done on the body. In special relativity:\n\nIf in the initial state the body was at rest, so \"v\" = 0 and γ(\"v\") = 1, and in the final state it has speed \"v\" = \"v\", setting γ(\"v\") = γ(\"v\"), the kinetic energy is then;\na result that can be directly obtained by subtracting the rest energy \"m\"\"c\" from the total relativistic energy γ(\"v\")\"m\"\"c\".\n\nThe Lorentz factor γ(\"v\") can be expanded into a Taylor series or binomial series for (\"v\"/\"c\") < 1, obtaining:\n\nand consequently\n\nFor velocities much smaller than that of light, one can neglect the terms with \"c\" and higher in the denominator. These formulas then reduce to the standard definitions of Newtonian kinetic energy and momentum. This is as it should be, for special relativity must agree with Newtonian mechanics at low velocities.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are three distinct periods for the style, 12th to 13th century, 13th to 14th century and 13th to the 15th century, with some obvious overlap.\n\nFeatures common to all three types include:\n\nTo retain the greatest spiritual potency, Buddha icons in Thai temples had to resemble as closely as possible an original prototype that tradition erroneously believed had been made during the lifetime of the Buddha. Of the three major efforts by Thai kings to establish an \"authentic\" canon for the icons, the Sukhothai style was the first, followed by the U Thong and the lion types.\n\nThe populace of Southern Thailand, which captured Sukhothai in approximately 1350, was in the 14th century still largely Mon, and the fusion of styles resulted in the more solid, corporeal, and squared-off U Thong image. Although the resulting changes may be seen most readily in the shape of the head, now more square than oval, and the broader, more sober features, there is also an increased heaviness of the body, no longer weightless but firmly seated on the ground.\n\nWhile the Sukhothai style is characterized by linear emphasis, the U Thong style again shows concern for solidity and modeling. At the same time, the U Thong images are rather stolid and lack the linear excitement and uniquely Thai character of Sukhothai art. U Thong style, like Sukhothai style, is still copied in Thailand.\n"}

Typically, range is less than . Tactical ballistic missiles are usually mobile to ensure survivability and quick deployment, as well as carrying a variety of warheads to target enemy facilities, assembly areas, artillery, and other targets behind the front lines. Warheads can include conventional high explosive, chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. Typically tactical nuclear weapons are limited in their total yield compared to strategic rockets.\n\nTactical ballistic missiles fill the gap between conventional rocket artillery and longer-range short-range ballistic missiles. Tactical missiles can carry heavy payloads deep behind enemy lines in comparison to rockets or gun artillery, while having better mobility and less expense than the more strategic theatre missiles. Additionally, due to their mobility, tactical missiles are better suited to responding to developments on the battlefield.\n\nFor many nations, tactical missiles represent the upper limit of their land-based military equipment. They can provide a powerful weapon for a very economical price, and in some cases are sought to help level the field against opponents who are clearly superior in other areas of military technology. Currently, ballistic missile technology is relatively accessible to nations that may find other military technology beyond easy reach.\n\nBallistic missiles are still difficult to defeat on the battlefield. Newer air defense systems have improved ability to intercept tactical missiles, but still can not reliably protect assets against ballistic missile threats. This allows a moderate force of missiles to threaten a superior enemy by penetrating their air defenses better than with conventional aircraft, while providing a deeper strike than conventional artillery.\n\nEarly large rockets and missiles were propelled by liquid-propellant rocket engines, as the first types developed. These were replaced as soon as possible by solid fuel rocket motors. Liquid propellants involve cryogenic (liquid oxygen) or corrosive (nitric acid) oxidisers. These must be loaded before launch, delaying the rocket's time into action. This delay was a problem for large strategic missiles, but especially so for tactical.\n\nMissiles, particularly in the Soviet Union, switched to using storable liquid propellants such as IRFNA, inhibited nitric acid. These were still hazardous to handle, but could be stored pre-loaded in the missile. This also allowed the development of single vehicle transporter erector launchers (TEL), rather than the previous convoy of carriers, launchers, fuel vehicles and service vehicles.\n\nWestern missiles adopted solid propellants instead, which were inherently storable, and later Warpac missiles followed suit. Tactical missiles are now almost universally solid-fuelled, except for some satellite states using indigenous developments of the original Scud platform.\n\n"}

Chuang was a member of Bunnag family who had descended from Shiekh Ahmad the Persian minister of King Prasat Thong (His lineage had converted to Theravada Buddhism in the mid-eighteenth century.). In 1818, the Grand Palace expanded south and Bunnags moved to their new residence on the West bank of Chao Phraya River in modern Thonburi District. Chuang's father, Tish, was later invested as \"Chao Phraya\" Phraklang the Minster of Trade.\n\nChuang began his career by entering the royal palace as one of the royal pages by around 1828. He was traditionally educated at Wat Pho. With his father being the Minister of Trade, Chuang became acquainted to royal trades and exposed to Western sciences. He was given title \"Luang\" Sit \"Nai\" Wen (). He was said to be able to communicate in English. Chuang rose through ranks in the Royal Household Office. His main pursuit was shipbuilding. Chuang built a brigantine called \"Ariel\", the first Western rigged ship ever built in Siam, at Chantaburi in 1835 where his father had been assigned to build fortifications. Chuang presented \"Ariel\" to King Rama III who named the ship \"Klaew Klang Samutr\" (). Chuang invited Dan Beach Bradley to board his ship to Chantaburi in October 1835. Bradley called Chuang \"Luang Nai Sit\" and mentioned that in front of Chuang's house there was an engraving in English; \"\"This is Luang Nai Sit's house - welcome friends.\"\" Chuang was close to Prince Isaret Rangsan (later vice-king Pinklao) who shared Chuang's enthusiasms in shipbuilding and British-American culture.\n\nChuang was appointed \"Chameun\" Waiworanat, a high-ranking royal page. In Siamese–Vietnamese War (1841–1845), King Rama III commissioned Prince Isaret Rangsan and Chuang Bunnag to bring five Siamese rigged warships to attack Hà Tiên in January 1842. Prince Isaret Rangsan stayed at Phú Quốc and Chuang led the assault into Hà Tiên and sent Cambodian regiment to take Cô Tô mountain. After one week of bombardments, the reinforced Vietnamese did not yield. Prince Isaret Rangsan and Chuang Bunnag decided to retreat due to unfavorable winds.\n\nThe British had been granted trade permissions in the 1826 Burney Treaty but much of traditional royal monopoly was retained. Trade with Westerners had been monopolized by \"Phra Klang Sinka\" or Royal Storage Department since 1511. All Western cargoes were monitored by the \"Phra Klang Sinka\" who collected tariffs and bartered prices. Western traders could not trade directly with private Siamese merchants. After the First Opium War, the British was eager to demand free trade in Siam. James Brooke the governor of Labuan arrived in Bangkok in September 1850. King Rama III elevated Chuang to \"Phraya\" Sri Suriyawongse and assigned him to receive Brooke. However, as the king had been ill, no further agreement was reached.\nUpon the coronation of King Mongkut in April 1851, Prince Isaret Rangsan was made the Vice-King Pinklao at the Front Palace and Chuang's father the Phraklang was made \"Somdet Chao Phraya\" Borom Maha Prayurawongse. Chuang was also made \"Chao Phraya\" Sri Suriyawongse () the deputy \"Kalahom\" the Minister of Southern Siam. His father held the position of Samuha Kalahom \"de jure\" as Sri Suriyawongse had already taken his father's responsibilities in the \"Kalahom\". Sri Suriyawongse moved to his new residence in Khlong San District, where he maintained a private dock and continued to engage in shipbuilding.\n\nJohn Bowring arrived in April 1855 and Sri Suriyawongse received him with pomp ceremonies. His father Prayurawongse strongly opposed British proposals on free trade issues but King Mongkut and Sri Suriyawongse had realized that Siam was in no position to resist British demands. The Bowring Treaty was achieved through Sri Suriyawongse's mediation with his father. The free trade and extraterritoriality was granted to the British and the four hundred years of royal monopoly on Western trade was ended.\n\nSri Suriyawongse's father Prayurawongse died in April 1855, one month after the Bowring Treaty. Sri Suriyawongse was officially invested as \"Samuha Kalahom\" the Prime Minister of Southern Siam and became \"de facto\" in charge of Siamese foreign affairs. Sri Suriyawongse was then called by the honorific \"Pana Hua Chao Than\" (). Bowring Treaty was the first of \"unequal treaties\" that had been agreed by Siam with Western nations. The free trades and extraterritoriality was granted to the United States (Harris) in May 1856 and France (Montigny) in August 1856, all of which Sri Suriyawongse and Prince Wongsa Dhiraj Snid played leading roles.\n\nIn the reign of King Mongkut, Siam established the first standing navy and was divided into the Royal Navy and the Front Palace Navy. Sri Suriyawongse became the first ever Commander of the Royal Navy while the Front Palace Navy was commanded by Vice-King Pinklao himself. In 1860, King Mongkut ordered Sri Suriyawongse to lead the construction of Phra Nakhon Khiri at Phetchaburi to be a detached palace.\n\nCambodia had been traditionally under Siamese suzerainty. In August 1863, La Grandière the French admiral had King Norodom of Cambodia signed a treaty that put Cambodia under French protectorate without Siam's acknowledgement. Sri Suriyawongse responded by having King Norodom secretly signed another treaty that recognized Siamese suzerainty over Cambodia. Gabriel Aubaret arrived at Bangkok in April 1864 to be the French consul and started negotiation with Sri Suriyawongse about French-Siamese border proclamations. \"The Straits Times\" published the secret Cambodian-Siamese treaty on 20 August 1864, much to the embarrassment of Aubaret who had been unaware of the treaty. Aubaret went directly to King Mongkut to denounce \"\"Kalahom\"\" Sri Suriyawongse. The agreements were delayed and resumed in April 1865 but this treaty was not ratified at Paris as France would recognized Siamese rule over \"Siamese Laos\". Siam decided to dispatch a mission to Paris in 1865 led by Sri Suriyawongse's son Won Bunnag and the treaty was finally concluded in July 1867, in which Siam recognized French protectorate of Cambodia while in turn France accepted Siamese rule over \"Inner Cambodia\" (Northwestern Cambodia; Battambang, Siemreap and Sisophon, which had been annexed to Siamese direct rule since 1795 and would be ceded to French Indochina later in 1907.).\nIn 1866, King Mongkut commissioned Sri Suriyawongse to oversee the construction of a 35-km long canal that connected Tha Chin River and Mae Klong River to facilitate commuting into Western Siam. The construction was finished in 1868 and was named Damnoen Saduak Canal. As Sri Suriyawongse had spent his own wealth on the construction of the canal, King Mongkut allowed the Bunnags to settle along the canal. In August 1868, Sri Suriyawongse organized the royal outing of King Mongkut to Wa Keo, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province with his son Prince Chulalongkorn to observe the Solar eclipse of August 18, 1868 calculated by the king.\n\nAfter the demise of his father in 1855 and the demise of Vice-King Pinklao in 1866, Sri Suriyawongse emerged as the most powerful courtier. After the solar eclipse event, King Mongkut was exposed to malaria and died in October 1868. Sri Suriyawongse held a council of royal princes and top ministers. The council affirmed that Prince Chulalongkorn, who was fifteen years old, would succeeded the throne and Sri Suriyawongse was to be appointed Regent during the minority of the new king. However, Sri Suriyawongse wished Vice-King Pinklao's son Prince Wichaichan be appointed as the Front Palace or heir presumptive. Prince Vorachak objected this, saying that the rights of appointing an heir belonged to the king, but Sri Suriyawongse prevailed. Sri Suriyawongse was succeeded as \"Samuha Kalahom\" and as the Commander of Royal Navy by his son Won Bunnag who was made \"Chao Phraya\" Surawong Waiyawat in 1869.\n\nIn the 1870s, during his Regency, Sri Suriyawongse wielded a great power. King Chulalongkorn later described the situation to Crown Prince Vajiravudh in July 1893; \"\"All of the princes were under Somdet Chao Phraya's power\"\". Phra Putthachariya To, the abbot of Wat Rakhangkhositaram, famously held a large candle into Sri Suriyawongse's house in the midday asking whether he wanted to usurp the throne. Sri Suriyawongse asserted his loyalty to the young king and Phra Putthachariya To left.\n\nAt the end of his regency in September 1873 when King Chulalongkorn had reached maturity, Sri Suriyawongse was invested the \"Somdet Chao Phraya\" Borom Maha Sri Suriyawongse with honors equal to a prince, the same rank his father had previously received - the highest rank a Siamese noble had ever attained during the Rattanakosin period. Sri Suriyawongse retired to his new estate in Ratchaburi where he spent last nine years of his life.\n\nThe retired Sri Suriyawongse became involved in the politics again in an event known as \"Front Palace Crisis\" in December 1874. Stand-offs between King Chulalongkorn and Prince Wichaichan the Front Palace led to the latter taking refuge in British consulate. Thomas George Knox the British consul-general had been known to support Vice-King Pinklao's lineage and to prevent British intervention King Chulalongkorn requested Sri Suriyawongse for aid. Sri Suriyawongse arrived at Bangkok and managed to convince Prince Wichaichan to leave British consulate.\n\nIn January 1883, Sri Suriyawongse fell seriously ill at his estate at Ratchaburi. His eldest son Won Bunnag had him transported in a steamboat from Ratchaburi to Bangkok for treatment but Sri Suriyawongse died \"en route\" at Amphoe Krathum Baen, Samut Sakhon Province on 19 January 1883, aged 74. His funeral was held in manners and honors of a royalty.\n\nSri Suriyawongse married Lady Klin Bunnag who was also his half-cousin (her father was Prayurawongse's half brother) and became his main wife. He had a son and three daughters with her including;\nHe had another two wives but did not have any more children.\n\nSri Suriwongse received the following royal decorations in the honours system of Thailand:\n\n"}

As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the city had a population of 45,362. It is the center of the Guayama metropolitan area, which was home to 84,214 in 2010.\n\nDuring the early years of the Spanish colonization, the region known today as Guayama was inhabited by Taíno Native People. The indigenous population in this area decreased due to slavery and migration to the Lesser Antilles. The following centuries, the region was under attack from the Taíno rebellion, Caribs and pirates. The town was founded on January 29, 1736 as San Antonio de Padua de Guayama by then Spanish Governor Matías de Abadía, although there is knowledge of it being populated by native people as early as 1567. Guayama took its name from an Indian leader, or cacique who governed the Southeastern region of the Island, the Guamaní cacique and the Guayama cacique. The meaning of the Indian name is \"Great Place\" (in Spanish \"Sitio Grande\"). It was Governor Don Tomás de Abadía who officially declared Guayama a \"pueblo\" (town) with the name of \"San Antonio de Padua de Guayama\". That same year the Catholic Church in town, San Antonio de Padua, was declared a Parish. In 1776, Guayama had 200 houses, the church and a central plaza and the total population was approximately 5,000 villagers. Construction on Guayama's Parroquial church of San Antonio de Padua began in 1827 and was completed 40 years later. In 1828 the construction of the King's House (Casa del Rey) was completed and the church was rebuilt as well. Earlier that year, Guayama was hit by a terrible fire that destroyed 57 houses and 9 huts. Guayama territorial order was altered at different times through the years. Some of the most populated neighborhoods were segregated to form new towns. Patillas was established in 1811 as an independent municipality. In 1831, the territory comprised the neighborhoods: Algarrobos, Ancones, Arroyo, Carreras, Guayama Pueblo, Guamaní, Jobos, Machete, and Yaurel. Later, Arroyo was divided into Arroyo Este and Arroyo Oeste and neighborhoods emerged: Pozo Hondo, Palmas de Aguamanil, Caimital, Pitajayas, Cuatro Calles, Sabana Eneas, Palmas, and Salinas. The latter had been segregated from Coamo.\n\nIn 1855, Arroyo was separated to become an independent municipality, taking the neighborhoods: Ancones, Arroyo, Yaurel, Pitajaya, and Cuatro Calles. By 1878, Guayama was a department head including: Comerío (then Sabana del Palmar), Cidra, Cayey, Salinas, Arroyo, San Lorenzo (then called Hato Grande), Aguas Buenas, Caguas, Gurabo, and Juncos. The development continued with the construction of the town cemetery in 1844, the slaughterhouse and meat market in 1851, and a wooden theater of two levels in 1878. By then Guayama had fourteen sugar plantations operating with steam engines and three with ox mills. Also practiced in this municipality was the exploitation of lead mines by the company \"La Estrella\", owned by Miguel Planellas, as well as the mineral galena, by the company \"La Rosita\", owned by Antonio Aponte. In 1881, Guayama is declared a Villa (First Order Municipality).\nDuring the Spanish–American War, American forces under General Nelson A. Miles landed at Guánica near Ponce on July 25, 1898. The landing surprised the United States War Department no less than the Spanish, as Miles had been instructed to land near San Juan (the War Department learned of the landing through an Associate Press release.) However, en route to Puerto Rico Miles concluded that a San Juan landing was vulnerable to attack by small boats, and so changed plans. Ponce, said at the time to be the largest city in Puerto Rico, was connected with San Juan by a 70-mile military road, well defended by the Spanish at Coamo and Aibonito. In order to flank this position, American Major General John R. Brooke landed at Arroyo, just east of Guayama, intending to move on Cayey, which is northwest of Guayama, along the road from Ponce to San Juan. General Brooke occupied Guayama August 5, 1898, after slight opposition, in the Battle of Guayama. On August 9, the Battle of Guamaní took place north of Guayama. A more significant battle, the Battle of Aibonito Pass, was halted on the morning of August 13 upon notification of the armistice between the United States and Spain.\n\nWhen after the Treaty of Paris (1898), the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Guayama was 12,749.\n\nAfter the Spanish–American War, Guayama continued to develop. The Bernardini Theater built by engineer Manuel Texidor y Alcalá del Olmo opened in 1913. The venue, property of attorney Thomas Bernardini, was the scene for artists of international fame. By that time, Guayama was considered one of the most important cities on the island's social scene.\nIn the early twentieth century, there were selected societies such as the 'Coliseo Derkes' and 'Grupo Primavera', which endowed performing arts as well as scientific events. By the mid-twentieth century, Guayama achieved great industrial development, especially with the establishment of Univis Optical Corp., Angela Manufacturing Company and a petrochemical complex of the Phillips Petroleum Company. In 1968, the company started production of paraffin, benzene, synthetic fibers, nylon, plastic anhydrous, a million gallons of gasoline a day, and many other products. During that same decade agriculture began to decline as a result of land loss, industrialization and the construction of multiple housing developments. The urban growth affected the sugar cane industry. However, in 1974, 155,595 tons of sugar cane was harvested in the Municipality producing 12,655 tons of refined sugar.\n\nIn November 2002, AES Puerto Rico opened its coal power plant in Guayama. The company transmits and distributes electricity through a 25-year contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. The 2012 National Puerto Rican Day Parade was dedicated to the Municipality of Guayama and its people.\n\nGuayama is located at .\nThe Municipality of Guayama is located on the Southern Coastal Valley region, bordering the Caribbean Sea, south of Cayey; east of Salinas; and west of Patillas and Arroyo. Guayama's municipal territory reaches the central mountain range to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. The mountain systems Sierra de Jajome (2,395 feet or 730 meters) and Sierra de Cayey cover some of the municipality area. The highest points are the Cerro de la Tabla (2,834 feet or 863 meters) and Cerro Tumbado (2,450 feet or 746 meters), which are part of the Sierra de Cayey mountain system. Other elevations are the mountains Garau, Charcas and Peña Hendida. Parts of the Guavate-Carite Forest and the Aguirre State Forest are in Guayama. The Guavate-Carite Forest, a 6,000-acre nature reserve is inhabited by 50 species of birds, making this spot a recognized area for birding and has a reserve with a dwarf forest that was produced by the region's high humidity and moist soil. The Aguirre Forest includes: mangroves, tidal flats, bird rookeries, research lakes & large manatee population. The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve was established in 1987. The reserve is located between the coasts of Salinas and Guayama, approximately 2,883 acres of mangrove forest and freshwater wetlands. The two main components: Mar Negro mangrove forest, which consists of a mangrove forest and a complex system of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats; and Cayos Caribe Islets, which are surrounded by coral reefs and seagrass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas.\n\nHurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Guayama with the significant amount of rainfall. After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, the people of Guayama had to resort to collecting spring water.\n\n\nThe annual precipitation is approximately 52 inches and the average temperature is 81 °F.\n\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Guayama is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as .\n\n\nPopulation, per 2010 census: Algarrobo 6,959; Caimital 4,124; Carite 1,210; Carmen 619; Guamaní 1,455 ; Guayama Pueblo 16,891; Jobos 8,286; Machete 3,846; Palmas 709; Pozo Hondo 1,263; Total 45,362\n\nGuayama has 19 beaches including .\n\nOther places of interest in Guayama include:\n\nGuayama is home to various pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies like; Pfizer, Baxter, Eli Lilly, and Tapi. A coal power plant operated by AES and a Phillips Petroleum Company petrochemical complex are also in the area.\n\nIn 2001, law 1-2001 was passed to identify communities with high levels of poverty in Puerto Rico. In 2017, Governor Rosello created a new government agency to work with the Special Communities of Puerto Rico Program. Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods are in Guayama: Borinquén, Comunidad Mosquito, Comunidad Puerto de Jobos, Loma del Viento, and Pueblito Del Carmen.\n\nThe San Lucas Episcopal Hospital, located on Pedro Albizu Campos Avenue and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Puerto Rico and the Santa Rosa Hospital are the main medical facilities in Guayama. The Veterans Health Administration operates a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (COBC) in the Municipality.\n\nGuayama is the birthplace of numerous artists and musicians who have significantly influenced Puerto Rican culture. During the 20th century, the literature aspect of the city was influenced by performers including Afro-Antillano genre poet Luis Palés Matos and his father Vicente Palés Anés. Music composer Catalino \"Tite\" Curet Alonso who became a composer of over 2,000 salsa songs is also from Guayama, even though he was raised in the Santurce section of San Juan. Other performers born in Guayama include actresses Gilda Galán and Karla Monroig.

Between those communities, the highway travels mostly through thick boreal forest. It was assumed in 1956, following its present course and remaining unchanged since. It is a lightly travelled route accommodating, on an average day, no more than 850 vehicles.\n\nHighway 534 begins in Restoule Provincial Park in Patterson Township. It travels south, curving along the eastern shore of Restoule Lake, south to the town of Restoule, where it then bends southeast and cuts through the northeast corner of Pringle Township near the community of Carr. Here it meets Highway 524, a short highway that travels south through Carr to Farleys Corners. From the junction with Highway 524, the route curves northeast into the Township of Nipissing.

At the time Chambers was still employed by \"Time\" magazine, having not yet gone public with his charges against Alger Hiss, and so declined to participate.\n\nThe book contains Fischer's definition of \"Kronstadt\" as the moment in which some communists or fellow-travelers decide not just to leave the Communist Party but to oppose it as anti-communists. Editor Crossman said in the book's introduction: \"The Kronstadt rebels called for Soviet power free from Bolshevik dominance\" (p. x). After describing the actual Kronstadt rebellion, Fischer spent many pages applying the concept to some subsequent former communists—including himself: \"What counts decisively is the 'Kronstadt.' Until its advent, one may waver emotionally or doubt intellectually or even reject the cause altogether in one's mind and yet refuse to attack it. I had no 'Kronstadt' for many years\" (p. 204).

In the United States he helped secure the first Act of Congress for the irrigation of California.\n\nIn 1853 Brereton studied practical mechanics at King's College London, entering the field of civil engineering upon graduating. He joined Brunel's design team, of which Brereton's second cousin R.P. Brereton was also a member. He worked on the Royal Albert Bridge across the River Tamar at Saltash, and the construction of the Cornish railway.\n\nBrereton was first employed in Brunel's office in Duke St, London from 1854 to 1855 where he witnessed the building of the SS Great Eastern. In 1856 he worked on the engineering of the new Paddington Station, including bridges, warehouses, iron girder work, rail laying, and hydraulic and other machineries.\n\nRobert Maitland Brereton came to India in 1857 to work under Robert Graham as an assistant engineer. While there, he started work on the construction of the Bombay to Calcutta Railway, which was to form the backbone of the Indian Railways.\n\nIn January 1858 Brereton escaped death twice when his camp at the Sake River was attacked and looted by a band of 500 Bhils, during the unrest associated with the Indian mutiny.\n\nAs he gained promotions, Brereton was eventually appointed chief engineer for the Grand Indian Peninsular Railway and undertook to complete the strategic connection across the continent. This was accomplished in 1870, ahead of the promised schedule. Opening the railway from Bombay to Calcutta in March 1870, the Viceroy of India said, \"...it may happen that a thousand years hence, Mr. Brereton's ghost may still hover with anxious solicitude over the unbroken piers of the Trowa Viaduct...\"\n\nIn 1871, following a severe drought in California, Brereton was called to San Francisco by William Chapman Ralston, cashier of the Bank of California. For the next five years, Brereton was employed on various projects for the irrigation of the San Joaquin Valley lands. He supervised the surveying of the area and produced a detailed plan of irrigation canals. He was sent to Washington to advocate the scheme, and in 1873 Congress set up a commission to make recommendations on the development of the irrigation. Brereton declined an invitation to serve on the commission, but he nevertheless assisted its members and his plans were those endorsed by the commission.\n\nBrereton sought backing in Great Britain for both irrigation and emigration schemes in California. His 1872 pamphlet, \"Project for English Middle and Yeoman Class Colonies for California\", described the productivity of the land and drew attention to the opportunities, including the welcome that would await immigrants.\n\nBrereton's next assignment was back in his home county in England; operating in a new position created by an Act of Parliament, he was to manage the county's roads. In so doing, he had to overcome those people who had lived their live under the parochial system of road management and wanted good roads but begrudged their cost. He succeeded, and when he left the post, the Prince of Wales was amongst those signing his testimonial of appreciation.\n\nBrereton's next appointment was made by the third Duke of Sutherland and involved Brereton acting as the Duke's agent in encouraging crofters to take opportunities to resettle in Canada.\n\nR.M. Brereton came from Little Massingham in Norfolk, from a family that produced other notable Victorian engineers Cuthbert A. Brereton (Sir John Wolfe Barry's partner) and R.P. Brereton, Brunel's chief assistant.\n\nHe married Alice Fairchild of Waterloo, New York, and together they had four children. In retirement he lived in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn Oregon, he examined the Question: Did Sir Francis Drake Land on Any Part of the Oregon Coast?\n\n"}

{"id": "2021485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021485", "title": "Bortezomib", "text": "Bortezomib\n\nBortezomib, sold under the brand name Velcade among others, is an anti-cancer medication used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. This includes multiple myeloma in those who have and have not previously received treatment. It is generally used together with other medications. It is given by injection.\nCommon side effects include nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, low platelets, fever, numbness, low white blood cells, shortness of breath, rash and abdominal pain. Other severe side effects include low blood pressure, tumour lysis syndrome, heart failure, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. It is in the class of medications known as proteasome inhibitor. It works by inhibiting proteasomes, cellular complexes that break down proteins.\nBortezomib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003 and in Europe in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United States it costs US$1,360 per 3.5 mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS £762 such that a course of treatment is about £12,261 as of 2014.\n\nTwo open-label trials established the efficacy of bortezomib (with or without dexamethasone) on days 1,4,8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of eight cycles in heavily pretreated people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The phase III demonstrated the superiority of bortezomib over a high-dose dexamethasone regimen (e.g. median TTP 6.2 vs 3.5 months, and 1-year survival 80% vs 66%). New studies show that bortezomib may potentially help recover from vincristine treatment in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia, when replacing vincristine in the process.\n\nGastro-intestinal (GI) effects and asthenia are the most common adverse events. Bortezomib is associated with peripheral neuropathy in 30% of patients resulting in pain. This can be worse in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. In addition, myelosuppression causing neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these side effects are usually mild relative to bone marrow transplantation and other treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Bortezomib is associated with a high rate of shingles, although prophylactic acyclovir can reduce the risk of this.\n\nOcular side effects such as chalazion or hordeolum (stye) may be more common in women and have led to discontinuation of treatment. Acute interstitial nephritis has also been reported.\n\nPolyphenols derived from green tea extract including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which were expected to have a synergistic effect, instead were found to reduce the effectiveness of bortezomib in cell culture experiments.\n\nThe drug is an N-protected dipeptide and can be written as Pyz-Phe-boroLeu, which stands for pyrazinoic acid, phenylalanine and Leucine with a boronic acid instead of a carboxylic acid.\n\nThe boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also rids the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support a role for the proteasome in maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and xenograft data support a similar function in solid tumor cancers. While multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby triggering programmed cell death in neoplastic cells. Recently, it was found that bortezomib caused a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome. Some intracellular peptides have been shown to be biologically active, and so the effect of bortezomib on the levels of intracellular peptides may contribute to the biological and/or side effects of the drug.\n\nAfter subcutaneous administration, peak plasma levels are ~25-50 nM and this peak is sustained for 1-2 hrs. After intravenous injection, peak plasma levels are ~500 nM but only for ~5 minutes, after which the levels rapidly drop as the drug distributes to tissues (volume of distribution is ~500 L). Both routes provide equal drug exposures and generally comparable therapeutic efficacy. Elimination half life is 9–15 hours and the drug is primarily cleared by hepatic metabolism.\n\nThe pharmacodynamics of bortezomib are determined by quantifying proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells taken from patients receiving the drug.\n\nBortezomib was originally made in 1995 at Myogenics. The drug (PS-341) was tested in a small Phase I clinical trial on patients with multiple myeloma. It was brought to further clinical trials by Millennium Pharmaceuticals in October 1999.\n\nIn May 2003, seven years after the initial synthesis, bortezomib (marketed as Velcade by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was approved in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in multiple myeloma, based on the results from the SUMMIT Phase II trial. In 2008, bortezomib was approved in the United States for initial treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. Bortezomib was previously approved in 2005, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy and in 2003, for the treatment of more refractory multiple myeloma.\n\nThe 2008 approval was based on an international, multicenter, open label, active-control trial in previously untreated patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma. Patients were randomized to receive either nine cycles of oral melphalan (M) plus prednisone (P) or MP plus bortezomib. Patients received M (9 mg/m2 ) plus prednisone (60 mg/m2 ) daily for four days every 6 weeks or the same MP schedule with bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 of every 6 week cycle for 4 cycles then once weekly for 4 weeks for 5 cycles. Time- to- progression (TTP) was the primary efficacy endpoint. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response rate (RR) were secondary endpoints. Eligible patients were age > 65 years. A total of 682 patients were randomized: 338 to receive MP and 344 to the combination of bortezomib plus MP. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the two groups.\n\nThe trial was stopped following a pre-specified interim analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in TTP with the addition of bortezomib to MP (median 20.7 months) compared with MP (median 15 months) [HR: 0.54 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.70), p= 0.000002]. OS, PFS, and RR also were significantly superior for the bortezomib-MP combination.\n\nIn August 2014, bortezomib was approved in the United States for the retreatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who had previously responded to Velcade therapy and relapsed at least six months following completion of prior treatment.\n\nIn October 2014, bortezomib was approved in the United States for the treatment of treatment-naïve patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).\n\nIn the UK, NICE initially recommended against Velcade in October 2006 due to its cost of about £18,000 per person, and because studies reviewed by NICE reported that it could only extend the life expectancy by an average of six months over standard treatment. However, the company later proposed a performance-linked cost reduction for multiple myeloma, and this was accepted.\n\n"}

National programs heard on WFUV include \"World Cafe\", \"The Grateful Dead Hour\", \"American Routes\", \"The Thistle and Shamrock\" and more.\n\nThe station's call letters stand for \"Fordham University's Voice.\" Though operated as a professional public radio station, WFUV's mission also includes a strong training component for Fordham students. Students receive intensive instruction and are heard on the air in news and sports programming.\n\nIn-studio interviews and performances are also a prominent feature of its programming. On-air guests have included Radio Hall of Famer Arthur Godfrey (in 1947), Pete Hamill, Steve Buscemi, Tim Robbins, Jefferson Airplane, The Association, Graham Nash, Roger McGuinn, The Washington Squares, Suzanne Vega, Jimmy Webb, Peter, Paul & Mary, Cyndi Lauper, Sting, Bo Diddley, Judy Collins, Lou Reed, Brian Wilson, Robert Klein, Kevin Bacon, Dick Cavett, Glen Campbell, Ringo Starr, Joshua Bell, Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel, Robbie Robertson, Los Lobos, Tony Bennett, John Zacherle, The Bad Plus, Buddy Guy, Rosanne Cash, Elvis Costello, Ani DiFranco, The Polyphonic Spree, Jackson Browne, Ben Harper, Richard Barone, The Decemberists, Moby, Uncle Tupelo, Josh Ritter, Neil Young, Of Monsters and Men, Violent Femmes, Mavis Staples, Brian Fallon, and Norah Jones (in her radio debut). WFUV has introduced many other new artists over the years.\n\nThe present day roster of air talent features longtime FUV DJ, Darren DeVivo, a station mainstay since 1983; Corny O'Connell, another WFUV vet who joined the staff in the late 1980s; New York City radio legend, Dennis Elsas, formerly of WNEW-FM; Alisa Ali and Assistant Music Director, Eric Holland. The station's team of DJ's also includes Delphine Blue; Janet Bardini, who recently returned after first working at FUV in the late 1970s into the early 1980s; Benham Jones; Production Director, Sarah Wardrop and Director of Technical Operations, George Evans. Specialty shows are hosted by Kathleen Biggins, who has been a part of WFUV since the mid 1980s (\"A Thousand Welcomes\"); Don McGee (\"Mixed Bag\", a program created by New York City radio icon, Pete Fornatale); Bob Sherman (\"Woody's Children\", a folk music program that's been heard on New York City radio for over fifty years); Paul Cavalconte, on his second tour of duty at WFUV, having started his broadcasting career at FUV in the late 1970s into the late 1980s (\"Cavalcade\"); John Platt (\"Sunday Supper\"); Digital Content Editor, Kara Manning (\"UKNY\"); guitarist Binky Griptite (\"The Boogie Down\"); Music Director, Russ Borris (\"The Alternate Side\") and Program Director, Rita Houston (\"The Whole Wide World\"). The iconic Irish music program, \"Ceol na nGael\", continues to be hosted by a fine team of Fordham students.\n\nDaily rock music programming was a major part of WFUV going back to the late 1960s. Prior to that, the programming was a mix of classical, popular, ethnic music and Fordham University sports broadcasts. Many chamber music and piano recitals were broadcast live from now-defunct Studio B in the 1950s. The station also broadcast a long-running series of live Sunday classical broadcasts from The Ethical Culture Society in Manhattan.\n\nWFUV was on the verge of going off the air in September 1968, due to budgetary cuts by the university, but the student-staff went on strike and organized rallies and demonstrations to save the station. WFUV has been a public radio station since 1990.\n\nIn May 1994, Fordham started building a transmission tower for WFUV on its Rose Hill campus, directly across from the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG)'s Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. The NYBG, which did not know about the tower's construction, subsequently requested that construction of the tower be halted. Construction was delayed for several months before the New York City Department of Buildings ruled that the tower could be built away from its originally proposed location. Both the NYBG and Fordham disagreed with the proposed compromise, however. In 1997, the FCC ruled that the tower would negatively affect the NYBG if it were finished, but a New York state court upheld the legality of the tower. In 2002, Montefiore Medical Center offered to move WFUV's antenna to its own facilities on Gun Hill Road, one of the highest locations in the Bronx, which Fordham agreed to. Fordham subsequently announced in 2004 that it intended to destroy the half-built tower on Rose Hill. In 2005 the studios, offices, and transmitter moved from the third floor of Keating Hall on Fordham's Rose Hill campus to Keating Hall's basement. The move allowed the station to improve its equipment and gain more space. Its antenna was moved in 2006 from the unfinished Rose Hill Tower to atop Montefiore Medical Center, and the unfinished tower was demolished.\n\nWFUV's rock music shows were formerly hosted by Fordham students, most notably Pete Fornatale, whose first show began in November 1964, when he was a sophomore and who returned to WFUV in 2001 after a 30-year hiatus, remaining until his 2012 death. Other alumni include, \nNews department alumni are/were heard on many stations and networks nationally.

Alan Light, former editor-in-chief of music magazines\" Vibe\" and \"Spin\" and music critic at the \"New York Times\" was an on-air contributor and music critic during the mid-2000s at WFUV. Radio announcer Marty Glickman instructed students in the sports department after his retirement. Glickman was the radio announcer of the New York Knicks, New York Giants, and New York Jets and the subject of the Martin Scorsese-produced 2013 HBO documentary film \"Glickman\". Glickman was succeeded by Bob Ahrens, who oversaw WFUV Sports for twenty years as Executive Sports Producer.\n"}

He is an author of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava theology and an international speaker on morality based on the wisdom of ancient Vedic scriptures.\n\nŚivarāma Swami was born in Budapest in a Jewish middle-class family to Holocaust survivor parents. His mother, Magda Létai, worked at UVATERV, a road and railway constructing company as a department supervisor. His father, Pál Létai, was a textile chemist. Although they raised their son protectively and conservatively, they did not introduce him to religious teachings. In December 1956, after his first year of primary school in Hungary, his family emigrated to Canada during the failed 1956 Hungarian revolution. In Montreal he continued his primary education and was introduced to religion at the Hungarian Protestant church he attended on Sundays. As a child he loved to read, and wrote many poems and stories. In 1966, inspired by his parents—especially his mother—Péter Létai was accepted by McGill University in Montreal, where he studied metallurgical engineering. Due to his conservative upbringing, he was taken aback by the behavior of students and teachers alike, and felt that real values and character training were lacking. Education was focused only on getting a career and enjoying the world. His disappointment made him open to alternative ways of thinking. In 1967, he first saw members of ISKCON, representatives of the Indian bhakti tradition, chanting and dancing at the university campus and at the Montreal World’s Fair.\n\nHe married in 1969, and his wife awoke his interest to alternative lifestyles, specifically all things Indian. They both became vegetarians committed to a non-violent lifestyle. He spent the summer of 1970 in Boulder, Colorado, working at a pilot mill, and while trying out vegetarian eating options he visited a Hare Kṛṣṇa temple for the first time. Due to his interest in spiritualism and counterculture, on his way back to Montreal he visited Haight-Ashbury but did not find the standard of dress, culture, or character of hippies attractive. Having lost interest in his studies and career, he attended public programs held by the young Guru Maharaji, but was left unimpressed by his presentations. He did, however, become interested in the ancient wisdom of the \"Bhagavad Gita,\" a book mentioned by every text on Indian mysticism.\n\nDisappointed in materialistic education, in 1971, during his 5th year of studies, he left McGill and traveled to Miami to distance himself from his concerned family. He acquired a copy of \"Bhagavad-gītā As It Is\" and \"Kṛṣṇa\" written by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, Founder-Ācārya of ISKCON, and reading his commentaries made the ancient wisdom of India relevant and applicable. He planned to meet the author and accept him as his spiritual guide, something that was not to be for some years still. In 1972, back in Montreal, he and his wife became regular guests at the ISKCON centre and started to follow the spiritual practices and lifestyle of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. The association of Vaiṣṇavas, spiritual practices and the study of books led to a desire to go beyond being a believer to being an active member. He wanted to dedicate his whole life to spreading knowledge of spirituality and God consciousness by giving up family life and living as a celibate monk.\n\nIn April 1973, at the age of 24, he joined the Montreal Hare Kṛṣṇa temple as a full-time monk. He shaved his long hair and started to dedicate himself to the budding spiritual movement led by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. He led a simple life: rising early, attending temple programs, meditating, studying, and distributing A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami’s books on the streets of Montreal. In June 1973 he received initiation and the spiritual name Śivarāma Dāsa from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. Due to his leadership abilities he was given responsibility to oversee the team of book distributors and later become temple president in Montreal, Winnipeg, Minneapolis, and Chicago. Responsibilities included managing the temples, educating and guiding ISKCON members, and presenting Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the general public. Following the death of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami in 1977, Śivarāma Dāsa accepted the renounced order of life, \"sannyāsa, \"in 1979, at the age of 29, and became Śivarāma Swami. In 1980 he was transferred to the United Kingdom and became the president of Chaitanya College, a Hare Kṛṣṇa Community in Worcester, as well as the national leader for distributing the books of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. He served in the UK for 25 years. In 1987, Śivarāma Swami became a member of the Governing Body Commission (GBC), the managerial and spiritual authority of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and was given responsibility for the UK and Ireland. In the same year he accepted the duties of initiating spiritual master, taking further responsibility to guide disciples in a God-centered life.\n\nBeing of Hungarian origin and speaking the language, the GBC requested Śivarāma Swami in 1987 to take responsibility for ISKCON’s mission in Hungary. He started to regularly visit Budapest, but due to the repressive communist environment, he would travel undercover as a painting importer, abandoning his monk attire for civil clothes and a wig. During his visits he spoke to interested people at their homes and gradually built a small community of serious practitioners. Hungary’s transition from communism to democracy opened the gates to religious freedom, and in 1989 the Hungarian branch of ISKCON(the International Society for Krishna Consciousness) became a legally incorporated religious organization called the Hungarian Society of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. In 1990, the first Hare Kṛṣṇa Temple was opened in Budapest, and with the arrival of serious Hungarian students Śivarāma Swami began initiating disciples. In the pioneer phase of preaching, Śivarāma Swami emphasised and inspired the translation, publication, and distribution of the sacred books of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition, translated and commented upon by A. C. Bhaktivedānta Swami. He also inaugurated the Hungarian section of ISKCON’s international food relief program called Food for Life, opened vegetarian restaurants throughout the country, and initiated the Ratha-yātrā chariot festival in Budapest.\n\nFrom 1991, to 1995, Śivarāma Swami organised the national tour of an Indian cultural festival, attracting the attention of Hungarians and making ISKCON widely known. Being a visionary and dedicated to the teachings of his spiritual master, he began work on a spiritual farming community. This project was based upon a God-centered life that embraced the principles of self sufficiency, environmental consciousness, dependence on the land, and the protection and caring for cows. It was also designed to provide a natural home and school for the society’s children. With 250 members and growing, this project, known as Krishna Valley, is currently the largest and most well organised ecological community in central Europe. Over thirty-thousand tourists visit Krishna Valley yearly, the biggest annual weekend festival being the Krishna Valley Fair (Búcsú), which attracts nearly ten thousand guests. The motto of Krishna Valley, coined by A. C. Bhaktivedānta Swami, is ‟simple living, high thinking.\"\n\nŚivarāma Swami is also the architect of transforming Krishna Valley into an international place of pilgrimage creating landscaping, lakes, memorials, pavilions, and gardens to remind residents and visitors of Krishna’s birthplace in India, thus enriching the farm’s unique atmosphere.\n\nŚivarāma Swami is an advocate of spiritual education. To enable the systematic presentation of Vaiṣṇava philosophy, in 1998 he inspired the founding of the Bhaktivedanta Cultural and Academic Institute in Budapest, which in 2003 became Bhaktivedanta College. The college is ISKCON Hungary’s institute for higher education and the first independent accredited College of ISKCON that offers government accredited degrees in Vaiṣṇava theology and Yoga master.\n\nŚivarāma Swami engaged in several legal and political skirmishes to defend freedom of religion in Hungary as well as the legal status of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there. Under his leadership and based upon the 1% tax offerings to religions by the public, ISKCON Hungary has been rated as the 4th most popular Church in the country.\n\nIn June 2003, Śivarāma Swami resigned as GBC representative for UK & Ireland and focused his attention fully on developing the Hungarian community. In 2005 he became co-GBC for Romania and in 2007 GBC secretary for Turkey. He traveled these countries to expand ISKCON’s activities in keeping with political and religious restrictions. In 2019 he fully retired from his GBC duties. Today Śivarāma Swami travels regularly between India and the West, inspiring thousands in their spiritual practices and sharing the teachings of \"bhakti-yoga\". During his travels he regularly meets academics, public officials, and political leaders to discuss social, environmental, and economical problems in light of India’s ancient spiritual wisdom. He is also an active speaker in interfaith dialogues and a member of the European Council of Religious Leaders.\n\nOn 20 October 2009, Śivarāma Swami received the Gold Cross of Merit of the Hungarian Republic, the second highest award in the state at the Museum of Applied Arts in Budapest. He was awarded this recognition by Károly Manherz, the State Secretary for Higher Education and Science, \"in appreciation of his philanthropic and humanitarian work, and for his outstanding exemplary activities in enriching universal human values.\"\n\nŚivarāma Swami is well known for his deep knowledge of Vaiṣṇava scriptures, reflected through his lectures, seminars, and personal guidance to the thousands of people he meets annually through his travels. His childhood affinity for writing resurfaced in a desire to present Vaiṣṇava theology and culture in a form more lasting than occasional talks. His first work, \"The Bhaktivedanta Purports\", published in 1998, responded to academic criticism of the \"Bhagavad-gītā\" commentaries of his spiritual master. In the same year he began the \"Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana\" series, books that are based on the 10th Canto of the \"Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam\", five volumes of which have been published so far. In total he has written twenty-two volumes on the philosophy and theology of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the most voluminous being \"Nava-vraja-mahimā\", a nine-volume treatise on the sacred land of Kṛṣṇa’s expansive Vraja district through the Vaiṣṇava perspective of pastime, pilgrimage, and philosophy. He is currently working on an extended series on social development in his \"Varṇāśrama Compendium\" handbooks. His works have been translated into Hungarian, Russian, and Spanish.\n\nŚivarāma Swami lives as a traveling monk, with no personal possessions or permanent home. He is a strict vegetarian, taking dairy products only where the milk comes from protected and nurtured cows. He likes to spend time in Krishna Valley’s natural environment and in Māyāpur, ISKCON’s spiritual capital in West Bengal. He performs daily mantra meditation, worship, \"kīrtana\"\",\" scriptural study, and writing.\n\n\n"}

Mode income is the most frequently occurring income in a given income distribution.\n\nMedian income can be calculated by household income, by personal income, or for specific demographic groups.\n\nIn 2013, Gallup published a list of countries with median annual household income, based on a self-reported survey of approximately 2000 adults from each country. Using median, rather than mean income, results in a much more accurate picture of the typical income of the middle class since the data will not be skewed by gains and abnormalities in the extreme ends.

{"id": "2021539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021539", "title": "Joint and several liability", "text": "Joint and several liability\n\nWhere two or more persons are liable in respect of the same liability, in most common law legal systems they may either be:\n\n\nIf parties have joint liability, then they are each liable up to the full amount of the relevant obligation. So if a married couple takes a loan from a bank, the loan agreement will normally provide that they are to be \"jointly liable\" for the full amount. If one party dies, disappears, or is declared bankrupt, the other remains fully liable. Accordingly, the bank may sue all living co-promisors for the full amount.\n\nHowever, in suing, the creditor has only one cause of action; i.e., the creditor can sue for each debt only once. If, for example, there are three partners, and the creditor sues all of them for the outstanding loan amount and one of them pays the liability, the creditor cannot recover further amounts from the partners who did not contribute to the liability.\n\nThe converse is several or proportionate liability, where the parties are liable for only their respective obligations. A common example of several liability is in syndicated loan agreements, which will normally provide that each bank is severally liable for its own part of the loan. If one bank fails to advance its agreed part of the loan to the borrower, then the borrower can sue only that bank, and the other banks in the syndicate have no liability.\n\nUnder joint and several liability or \"all sums\", a claimant may pursue an obligation against any one party as if they were jointly liable and it becomes the responsibility of the defendants to sort out their respective proportions of liability and payment. This means that if the claimant pursues one defendant and receives payment, that defendant must then pursue the other obligors for a contribution to their share of the liability.\n\nJoint and several liability is most relevant in tort claims, whereby a plaintiff may recover all the damages from any of the defendants regardless of their individual share of the liability. The rule is often applied in negligence cases, though it is sometimes invoked in other areas of law.\n\nIn the United States, 46 of the 50 states have a rule of joint and several liability, although in response to tort reform efforts, some have limited the applicability of the rule. About two dozen have reformed the rule, with several (Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Utah, Vermont, Oklahoma, and Wyoming) abolishing. In some instances it is abolished except where the defendants \"act in concert\".\n\nSome jurisdictions have imposed limits on joint and several liability, but without completely abolishing that doctrine. For example,\n\nIf Ann is struck by a car driven by Bob, who was served alcohol in Charlotte's bar (and the state has dramshop laws), then both Bob and Charlotte's bar may be held jointly liable for Ann's injuries. If the jury determines Ann should be awarded $10 million and that Bob was 90% at fault and Charlotte's bar 10% at fault:\n\nJoint and several liability can make a defendant liable for the full amount of damages suffered by a plaintiff even if that defendant bears only slight fault for the injury. For example, if a child is injured due to the negligence of a crossing guard employed by a school district, and a court finds the crossing guard to be 99% at fault for the child's injury and the school district to be only 1% at fault, the school district would be liable to pay 100% of the damages. In contrast, under several liability, if the crossing guard was unable to pay money toward the judgment the most that the injured child could recover would be 1% of the judgment from the school district.\n\nJoint and several liability is premised on the theory that the defendants are in the best position to apportion damages amongst themselves. Once liability has been established and damages awarded, the defendants are free to litigate amongst themselves to better divide liability. The plaintiff no longer needs to be involved in the litigation and can avoid the cost of continuing litigation.\n\nWhere a financially wealthy party can be named or joined as a defendant, a plaintiff has a greater chance of recovering damages than when the defendants have very limited economic resources or are financially insolvent, or \"judgment proof\". Opponents of the principle of joint and several liability argue that its use is unfair to many defendants.\n\nFor example, where an uninsured drunk driver causes an accident that results in injury, the plaintiff may sue an additional defendant, along with the drunk driver, such as suing the state highway department alleging that a highway defect contributed to the accident, hoping that the additional defendant will be found partly responsible.\n\nIn trying to achieve its aim of alleviating poverty, microfinance often lends to group of poor, with each member of the group jointly liable. That means that each member is responsible for ensuring that all the other members of the group repay too. If one member fails to repay, the members of the group are also held in default. Joint liability solves the information and enforcement problems associated with credit markets by encouraging screening, monitoring, costly state verification, and contract enforcement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2021545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021545", "title": "Open matte", "text": "Open matte\n\nOpen matte is a filming technique that involves matting out the top and bottom of the film frame in the movie projector (known as a \"soft matte\") for the widescreen theatrical release and then scanning the film without a matte (at Academy ratio) for a full screen home video release.\n\nOpen matte can be used with non-anamorphic films presented in 2.20:1 or 2.39:1, but it isn't used as often, mainly because it adds too much additional headroom, depending upon how well the framing was protected or if the director chooses to create a certain visual aesthetic. Instead, those films will employ either pan and scan or reframing using either the well-protected areas or the areas of interest. Films shot anamorphically use the entire 35mm frame (except for the soundtrack area), so they must use pan and scan as a result.\n\nThe rise of new film exhibition technologies in 1950s like Cinerama, and anamorphic lenses, shooting wide aspect ratios for theatrical films. This coincided with the rise of television and home media with a much different, narrow aspect ratio of 4:3. To avoid letterboxing for broadcast releases, films were therefore reframed and cropped shot by shot to fit appropriately, and full screen with the 4:3 aspect, with a process called Pan and Scan. Hence, only a cropped small portion of the theatrical frame was broadcast.\n\nMany films over the years have used the open matte technique for home video releases and television broadcasts, the most prominent of which include the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, the \"Jurassic Park\" trilogy, \"Schindler's List\", \"Titanic\", and \"Top Gun\" as well as many films that have been specially formatted for the IMAX expanded aspect ratio of 1.90:1 and 1.43:1. Stanley Kubrick also used this technique for his last three films \"The Shining\" (1980), \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987) and \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (1999). Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man (2002) and James Cameron's \"\" (1991) are also examples of open matte.\n\nPan and Scan deals with only the 2.39:1 master of a film. For HDTV, the film is panned and scanned to a portion of a frame, usually in accordance to the most important details in a shot. Open matte involves opening up the top and bottom of a frame to show more information, which is usually done with non-anamorphic films with a wide 2.39:1 aspect ratio to fill a 16:9 display for HDTV broadcasts. Additionally, filmmakers may choose to open up the frame for a film's home video release, such as with James Cameron's Avatar and the Blu-ray 3D release of Titanic.\n\nIf footage with taller ratios were shot (digitally or on film), for example IMAX scenes for various films, then the screen real-estate is cropped in accordance to the deliverable ratio. This helps in preserving headroom and composition for the film beyond the theatrical release.\n\nUsually, non-anamorphic 4-perf films are filmed directly on the entire full frame silent aperture gate (1.33:1). When a married print is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 full-screen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame (\"open matte\") instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, the decision to use it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and \"protect\" for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as boom microphones, cables, and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the un-matted 4:3 version may often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1), depending upon how well the framing was protected or if the director chooses to create a certain visual ascetic. With high definition television now in common usage (with its standardized 16:9 (1.78:1) aspect ratio), the need to reformat 1.85:1 movies for television viewing has virtually evaporated, although television broadcasts still reformat 2.39:1 movies by means of using open matte or pan and scan. For films with wider aspect ratios (2.39:1, for example) the matting bars will appear on the top and bottom of the screen of the broadcast image, thus preserving each director's framing intent.\n\n"}

During his 42-year reign, he dominated the Anglo-Norman settlers of Leinster.\n\nMacMurrough-Kavanagh's dominance of the province and its inhabitants, both Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman, was deemed sufficiently detrimental to the colony that Richard II of England spent much of the years 1394 and 1395 sparring with him. While MacMurrough-Kavanagh did eventually submit to Richard, he renounced this fealty on Richard's departure and made much of his kingdom a death trap for any invading English or Anglo-Irish forces. The Crown accordingly dealt with him cautiously and he was granted an amnesty in 1409.\n\nMacMurrough-Kavanagh married Elizabeth le Veel, widow of Sir John Staunton of Clane. She was the only daughter of Sir Robert le Veel, and through her father the heiress of the Anglo-Norman barony of Norragh. Such a racial intermarriage violated the Statutes of Kilkenny and the Crown thus forfeited Elizabeth's lands, which later became one of the causes of her husband's enmity to the English. They had three sons: Donnchadh, King of Leinster, Diarmuid Lamhdearg, and Gerald, Lord of Ferns. Elizabeth's estates later passed to the Wellesley family, who were descendants of her daughter, Elizabeth, by her first husband, Sir John Staunton of Clane; the Wellesleys were ancestors of the Duke of Wellington.\n\nMacMurrough-Kavanagh died soon after Christmas 1417, perhaps in his bed in Ferns, or perhaps was poisoned in New Rossaccounts differ.\n\nMacMurrough-Kavanagh's descendants include 19th century Irish politician Arthur MacMurrough Kavanagh.\n\nThe 1885 historical novel \"Art M'Morrough O'Cavanagh, Prince of Leinster: An Historical Romance of the Fourteenth Century\" by M. L. O'Byrne is a loosely biographical account of his life, written from a nationalist perspective.\n\n\n\n"}

At International level, he represented the senior England rugby union team between 2001 and 2010 and captained them between 2008 and 2010. He was appointed the England forwards coach in December 2015; a role which he left in mid 2020 to become head coach of Leicester Tigers.\n\nBorn in Carlisle, Cumbria, Borthwick was captain of the Hutton Grammar School rugby team, with whom he went on a tour to Australia.\n\nBorthwick joined Bath in 1998 from Preston Grasshoppers, making his debut against Saracens in December 1998. During this time, he was balancing rugby commitments with study, and graduated from the University of Bath in 2003 with a degree in Economics with Politics.\n\nBorthwick had, arguably, his best season for Bath in 2003–04. A central figure in the absence of many senior players due to the 2003 Rugby World Cup, he set about making his mark on the Zurich Premiership. Bath made the League Final that season, losing to London Wasps. He was one of the three nominees for the Zurich Premiership Player of the Year award. In his final game with the club, Borthwick captained Bath to victory in the 2007–08 European Challenge Cup.\n\nIn January 2008, Borthwick announced that he would be leaving Bath at the end of the 2007–08 season for Saracens F.C..\n\nFollowing his switch to Saracens, Borthwick was named co-captain for the 2008–09 season alongside Andy Farrell.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season he was named as the captain for Saracens F.C. Injury prevented him from playing for much of the season but he returned for the Guinness Premiership final but not as captain, as Saracens were defeated by the Leicester Tigers. However the following season he started as Saracens won their first Premiership title.\n\nOn 28 November 2013, Borthwick announced he would be retiring at the end of the 2013-2014 season.\n\nHe first emerged during England's tour of South Africa in 2000. Despite his presence in the line-out, he was not considered heavy enough for international rugby, but later bulked out. A regular choice as the England A team captain, from his debut against Wales A at Wrexham in February 2001, he had already played on the full tour of South Africa the previous summer. Injury prevented him from being considered for the next trip the following year to Argentina. Borthwick made his debut for England against France in the 2001 Six Nations.\n\nHe came on as a blood replacement for Ben Kay in the 25–14 win over Australia in Melbourne in June 2003, his sixth cap. A member of England's wider 2003 World Cup squad, he narrowly missed selection to the final 30. He regained his place in the England squad after the 2003 World Cup and despite England's disappointing results, Borthwick was given credit for his solid play.\n\nBorthwick initially failed to make England's squad for the 2005 Autumn internationals, with Gloucester forward Alex Brown seemingly poised for a start instead, but injury ruled Brown out of contention and Borthwick stepped in, playing a significant role against Australia, New Zealand and Samoa.\n\nBorthwick was selected as a member of the England 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. He played in three Group matches, starting against Tonga. He did not participate in the knockout games.\n\nOn Sunday 10 February 2008 Borthwick was named captain for England's 2008 Six Nations match against Italy in Rome, and on 13 May 2008 he was chosen to captain the full England squad on their 2008 summer tour of New Zealand. And in October 2008 he was named as Martin Johnson's first England Captain for the 2008 Autumn Internationals.\n\nBorthwick came under a lot of criticism after England's disappointing 2008 Autumn Internationals in which they suffered heavy defeats to New Zealand and South Africa. However Martin Johnson kept faith in him.\n\nIn the 2009 Six Nations, Borthwick came under more criticism as England's discipline cost them victories against Ireland and Wales. However, after performing much better against France and Scotland in the last two weeks of the tournament, Borthwick's critics seemed to leave him alone. In January 2010, Borthwick was confirmed as England captain for the 2010 Six Nations.\n\nAfter England's 15–15 draw Against Scotland in the 2010 Six Nations, Borthwick aggravated an ongoing knee injury and sought medical advice. This meant he was unavailable for selection against France so Tom Palmer was bought in as cover and Lewis Moody was given the captaincy in Borthwick's absence. Due to injury, Borthwick was not a member of the 2010 England rugby union tour of Australasia.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, Borthwick was dropped from the Elite Player Squad by Martin Johnson.\n\nBorthwick trained as a coach, taking his initial position in-club from 2012 whilst playing with Saracens, and also attending the University of Hertfordshire. From 2012 he was forwards coach alongside Eddie Jones for up to and including the 2015 Rugby World Cup, after which he was confirmed as forwards coach for Bristol Rugby under former Bath colleague Andy Robinson.\n\nOn Tuesday 15 December 2015 He was confirmed as England Forwards coach.\n\nAccording to reports from BBC Sport, Borthwick's next role will be with Leicester Tigers following the 2019 Rugby World Cup. It was later confirmed he would join the club for the 2020–21 Premiership Rugby season.\n\n"}

The number of wards were increased as the city grew.\n\nCity is incorporated — city limits are a radius from the zero mile marker of the Western & Atlantic Railroad. City covers , .\n\nThe 1848 charter only specified election of six citywide councilmembers, but on January 9, 1854, an ordinance was adopted that divided the town into five wards and two councilmen from each ward would be elected to coincide with the completion of the first official city hall.\nThe next election with the new rules on January 15, 1855, decided those first Ward bosses who would serve with the short-term mayor, Allison Nelson.\nThe boundaries were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 12, city limits expand to a one-and-a-half mile radius from Union Depot.\n\nDuring a huge boom of post-war building, two new wards were added from parts of the First, Fourth and Fifth to reflect the changing look of the city. \n\nA new city charter was approved by Governor Smith on February 28, 1874, which reduced the number of wards back to five and created a bi-cameral council of two councilmen from each ward and a second body of three at-large aldermen was established.\nEach year one of the aldermen would be up for election and during his last year in office would serve as president of the other body.\nThey acted separately on finances but together for all other business.\n\nThe new ward layout was as follows:\n\nOn November 5, 1883 a Sixth Ward (beige) was carved out of the Fourth and Fifth Wards.\nIts boundaries started at Butler and the GRR (today's Grady Hospital) north to North Ave at Myrtle St, then up Myrtle to the city limit at 3rd St.\nFollow the arc of the city limit to Williams, south to Cain (International) then James (Church) to Forsyth south to the tracks then east on the tracks to origin.\nThis separated the wealthy Peachtree corridor from the other parts of north Atlanta. (Garrett Vol II, p. 53–54)\n\nExpansion of city limits to one and three-quarters radius from union depot.\n\nWhen West End was annexed into the city in 1894, it became a new Seventh Ward.\n\n annexed - the southern part of what is now Midtown was already within the 1889 limits, but in 1904 the city annexes most of the rest of what is now Midtown: this is an area bounded by the 1889 circular city limits on the south, and West Peachtree St. on the west, stretching north up to but not including Ansley Park (roughly 6th to 16th Streets), Piedmont Park, the remainder of Historic Midtown east to what is now the BeltLine. this includes a strip of what is now the Old Fourth Ward between the 1889 limits and the BeltLine.\n\nFurther expansion of the city limits was part of a long effort.\n\nIn October 1897 Frank P. Rice drove a failed proposal to annex Pittsburgh, Reynoldstown, Bellwood, and what was then called \"north Atlanta\".\n\n\"North Atlanta\" was defined at the time roughly as today's Midtown, Georgia Tech, and English Avenue:\n\nIn 1902 a special committee made a new proposal to annex those areas as well as \"Bonnie Brae\", Copenhill, and the \"St. Charles Avenue\" area (in today's Virginia Highland). By then, \"north Atlanta\" was being referred to as \"Peachtree\".\n\nIn 1905, the Eighth Ward was added. An act of the Georgia General Assembly was enacted on August 3, 1904 which designated the area from then current city limits (at 6th St and West Peachtree), north to 15th St, then east to Piedmont Ave, then northeast to Southern Railway (basically follow Piedmont to the Ansley Park area), then southwardly along the railway the limits. The act also took part of the Sixth Ward north of North Ave. into the new Eighth Ward.\n\nOn January 1, 1909, a Ninth Ward was formed out of just annexed Copenhill, part of Druid Hills, Edgewood, Reynoldstown and East Atlanta. Edgewood alone had had its own city government before the annexation.\n\nAnnexation of to the north and west:\n\nAnnexation of including the town of Oakland City and from the previous city limits south to the BeltLine: Adair Park, most of Pittsburgh, southern Summerhill, southern/eastern edges of Grant Park neighborhood.\n\nAnnexation of the blocks surrounding Brown Park (now Brownwood Park) in East Atlanta - Moreland east to Stokesland and Glenwood south to the current city limits.\n\nA new Tenth Ward was created. The eastern boundary was McDaniel Street. The southwestern boundary was Whitehall Street to the Central of Georgia Railroad, and from there along the railroad to a point just south of the BeltLine. From there, the boundary ran due west to a prolongation of Holderness Street south of the BeltLine, and from there southwest to the junction of Campbellton and Utoy roads. Then due east along the north boundary of Fort McPherson to the Central of Georgia Railroad. Then south along that railway line to a point between Osborne and Astor avenues, then east to Sylvan Road, then north to the BeltLine, then east to McDaniel Street.\n\nThis included:\n\nEleventh Ward created from part of the Ninth Ward (area south of the Georgia railroad line) and from part of the Third Ward. The new ward corresponds to East Atlanta, Ormewood Park, and other adjacent areas.\n\n\nIn June 1923 there was a failed movement to annex College Park, East Point, and Hapeville.\n\n\nA Thirteenth Ward was created as the section of the Ninth Ward north of St. Charles and east of the Belt Line to the west side of Briarcliff and north the corporate limits. (most of today's Virginia-Highland)\n\nOn March 14, 1935, the legislature reduced the number of wards from 13 to 6 and the thirty-nine member city council is cut to eighteen members effective January 1, 1937. The wards were combined as such:\n\nIn 1951, after a failed 1947 referendum and two other failed attempts, the state legislature passed a \"Plan of Improvement\" by which on Jan. 1, 1952, the city annexed in Buckhead, Adams Park, Southwest Atlanta & Lakewood. This was by far the largest expansion in Atlanta's history, tripling the size of the city to and adding 100,000 residents. This helped spread the burden of providing public services by adding to the base a large group of mostly more affluent residents. The annexation was viewed as a triumph of Mayor Hartsfield.\n\nAtlanta would in the 1970s again try, but without success, to repeat the process by state legislation to annex what is now Sandy Springs to Atlanta.\n\nAnnexation of Ben Hill, Greenbriar and other adjacent areas in far southwestern Atlanta.\n\nThe ward system is ended. No longer a bicameral body, only a board of six aldermen with a Vice-Mayor serving as president of the board. All positions were elected citywide. (For post-ward setup, see Political structure of Atlanta).\n\nSince 1953, multiple small annexations (and deannexations) to the City of Atlanta have occurred, in two periods from 1954-1979 and 2003-2010. No annexations took place from 1979 to 2003.\n\nMultiple small areas adjacent to southwestern Atlanta were annexed including Midwest Cascade, Cascade Glen, and the Horseshoe Community. Sandtown's 2007 petition for annexation was put on hold.\n\nThese annexations added a few thousand residents, and approximately three square miles, including areas mostly in the southwest of the city, but also small parcels in the east and north of the city.\n\nIn December 2017, the Atlanta City Council approved an annexation request by Emory University, the Centers for Disease Control, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston Hospital, and other contiguous property owners in the Druid Hills neighborhood of Dekalb County. The annexation was effective January 1, 2018. In June 2017 the university leadership formally petitioned the City of Atlanta to annex it. To comply with the requirement that an annexed area be adjacent to the existing city limits, the university purchased a residence partially within the then-city limits. The city government also entered into a settlement with the DeKalb County government to settle a dispute, paving the way for the annexation.\n\nDue to the taxable revenue involved, there was a dispute over whether the area would remain in the DeKalb County School District or transition to Atlanta Public Schools. In 2016 Emory University made a statement that \"Annexation of Emory into the City of Atlanta will not change school districts, since neighboring communities like Druid Hills will still be self-determining regarding annexation.\" By 2017 the city agreed to include the annexed property in the boundaries of APS, a move decried by the leadership of DeKalb County Schools as it would take taxable property away from that district. In 2017 the number of children living in the annexed territory who attended public schools was nine. The annexed area ultimately went to APS, and as part of a 2019 settlement Emory would help establish school-based clinics for DeKalb schools. Students in the area will be rezoned to APS effective 2024; they will be zoned to DeKalb schools before then.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2021591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021591", "title": "Altruism (biology)", "text": "Altruism (biology)\n\nIn biology, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. Altruism in this sense is different from the philosophical concept of altruism, in which an action would only be called \"altruistic\" if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. In the behavioural sense, there is no such requirement. As such, it is not evaluated in moral terms—it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action is considered altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.\n\nThe term altruism was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as \"altruisme\", for an antonym of egoism. He derived it from the Italian \"altrui\", which in turn was derived from Latin \"alteri\", meaning \"other people\" or \"somebody else\".\n\nAltruistic behaviours appear most obviously in kin relationships, such as in parenting, but may also be evident among wider social groups, such as in social insects. They allow an individual to increase the success of its genes by helping relatives that share those genes. Obligate altruism is the permanent loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain). For example, honey bee workers may forage for the colony. Facultative altruism is temporary loss of direct fitness (with potential for indirect fitness gain followed by personal reproduction). For example, a Florida scrub jay may help at the nest, then gain parental territory.\n\nIn ethology (the study of behavior), and more generally in the study of social evolution, on occasion, some animals do behave in ways that reduce their individual fitness but increase the fitness of other individuals in the population; this is a functional definition of altruism. Research in evolutionary theory has been applied to social behaviour, including altruism. Cases of animals helping individuals to whom they are closely related can be explained by kin selection, and are not considered true altruism. Beyond the physical exertions that in some species mothers and in some species fathers undertake to protect their young, extreme examples of sacrifice may occur. One example is matriphagy (the consumption of the mother by her offspring) in the spider \"Stegodyphus\"; another example is a male spider allowing a female fertilized by him to eat him. Hamilton's rule describes the benefit of such altruism in terms of Wright's coefficient of relationship to the beneficiary and the benefit granted to the beneficiary minus the cost to the sacrificer. Should this sum be greater than zero a fitness gain will result from the sacrifice.\n\nWhen apparent altruism is not between kin, it may be based on reciprocity. A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed. Such reciprocity will pay off, in evolutionary terms, as long as the costs of helping are less than the benefits of being helped and as long as animals will not gain in the long run by \"cheating\"—that is to say, by receiving favours without returning them. This is elaborated on in evolutionary game theory and specifically the prisoner's dilemma as social theory.\n\nThe existence of altruism in nature is at first sight puzzling, because altruistic behaviour reduces the likelihood that an individual will reproduce. The idea that \"group selection\" might explain the evolution of altruism was first broached by Darwin himself in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, (1871). The concept of group selection has had a chequered and controversial history in evolutionary biology but the uncritical 'good of the species' tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due largely to the work of George C. Williams, and John Maynard Smith as well as Richard Dawkins. These evolutionary theorists pointed out that natural selection acts on the individual, and that it is the individual's fitness (number of offspring and grand-offspring produced compared to the rest of the population) that drives evolution. A group advantage (e.g. hunting in a pack) that is disadvantageous to the individual (who might be harmed during the hunt, when it could avoid injury by hanging back from the pack but still share in the spoils) cannot evolve, because the selfish individual will leave, on average, more offspring than those who join the pack and suffer injuries as a result. If the selfishness is hereditary, this will ultimately result in the population consisting entirely of selfish individuals. However, in the 1960s and 1970s an alternative to the \"group selection\" theory emerged. This was the kin selection theory, due originally to W. D. Hamilton. Kin selection is an instance of inclusive fitness, which is based on the notion that an individual shares only half its genes with each offspring, but also with each full sib (See footnote). From an evolutionary genetic point of view it is therefore as advantageous to help with the upbringing of full sibs as it is to produce and raise one's own offspring. The two activities are evolutionarily entirely equivalent. Co-operative breeding (i.e. helping one's parents raise sibs—provided they are full sibs) could thus evolve without the need for group-level selection. This quickly gained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of social behaviour.\n\nIn 1971 Robert Trivers introduced his reciprocal altruism theory to explain the evolution of helping at the nest of an unrelated breeding pair of birds. He argued that an individual might act as a helper if there was a high probabilistic expectation of being helped by the recipients at some later date. If, however, the recipients did not reciprocate when it was possible to do so, the altruistic interaction with these recipients would be permanently terminated. But if the recipients did not cheat then the reciprocal altruism would continue indefinitely to both parties' advantage. This model was considered by many (e.g. West-Eberhard and Dawkins) to be evolutionarily unstable because it is prone to invasion by cheats for the same reason that cooperative hunting can be invaded and replaced by cheats. However, Trivers did make reference to the Prisoner's Dilemma Game which, 10 years later, would restore interest in Trivers' reciprocal altruism theory, but under the title of \"tit-for-tat\".\n\nIn its original form the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The \"game\" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) (\"cooperation\") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG: two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behaviour: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy. Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances.\n\nHowever, in 1981 Axelrod and Hamilton noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (the so-called Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by Robert Triver's reciprocal altruism theory) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism. In \"tit-for-tat\" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, \"generous tit-for-tat\", which behaves like \"tit-for-tat\", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was \"betray\".), but all can be outperformed by at least one of the other strategies, should one of the players switch to such a strategy. The result is that none is evolutionarily stable, and any prolonged series of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game, in which alternative strategies arise at random, gives rise to a chaotic sequence of strategy changes that never ends.\n\nIn the light of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game failing to provide a full answer to the evolution of cooperation or altruism, several alternative explanations have been proposed.\n\nThere are striking parallels between altruistic acts and exaggerated sexual ornaments displayed by some animals, particularly certain bird species, such as, amongst others, the peacock. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led Amotz Zahavi to suggest that both might be fitness signals rendered evolutionarily stable by his handicap principle. If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, the signal has to be evolutionarily costly. Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality. Zahavi borrowed the term \"handicap principle\" from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse handicap race, provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in amateur golf, better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by its increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is its health. An altruistic act is, by definition, similarly costly. It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case altruism is evolutionarily stabilized by sexual selection.\nThere is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a non-silent mutation will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through natural selection, while less adaptive attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare. Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features. This will have the effect of a sexual population rapidly shedding peripheral phenotypic features and canalizing the entire outward appearance and behaviour so that all the members of that population will begin to look remarkably similar in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the African pygmy kingfisher, \"Ispidina picta\". Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviours will also be rendered evolutionarily stable, including any altruistic, cooperative and social characteristics. Thus, in the example of the selfish individual who hangs back from the rest of the hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate. Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.\n\nAltruism in animals describes a range of behaviors performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others. The costs and benefits are measured in terms of reproductive fitness, or expected number of offspring. So by behaving altruistically, an organism reduces the number of offspring it is likely to produce itself, but boosts the likelihood that other organisms are to produce offspring. There are other forms of altruism in nature other than risk-taking behavior, such as reciprocal altruism. This biological notion of altruism is not identical to the everyday human concept. For humans, an action would only be called 'altruistic' if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. Yet in the biological sense there is no such requirement. Instead, until we can communicate directly with other species, an accurate theory to describe altruistic acts between species is Biological Market Theory.\nHumans and other animals exchange benefits in several ways, known technically as reciprocity mechanism. No matter what the mechanism, the common thread is that benefits find their way back to the original giver.\n\nAlso known as the \"buddy-system\", mutual affection between two parties prompts similar behavior in both directions without need to track of daily give-and-take, so long as the overall relationship remains satisfactory. This is one of the most common mechanism of reciprocity in nature, this kind is present in humans, primates, and many other mammals.\n\nAlso known as, \"If you're nice, I'll be nice too.\" This mechanism of reciprocity is similar to the heuristic of the golden rule, \"Treat others how you would like to be treated.\" Parties mirror one another's attitudes, exchanging favors on the spot. Instant attitudinal reciprocity occurs among monkeys, and people often rely on it with strangers and acquaintances.\n\nAlso known as, \"what have you done for me lately?\" Individuals keep track of the benefits they exchange with particular partners, which helps them decide to whom to return favors. This mechanism is typical of chimpanzees and very common among human relationships.\nYet some opposing experimental research suggests that calculated or contingent reciprocity does not spontaneously arise in laboratory experimental settings, despite patterns of behavior.\n\nBiological market theory is an extension of the idea of reciprocal altruism, as a mechanism to explain altruistic acts between unrelated individuals in a more flexible system of exchanging commodities. The term 'biological market' was first used by Ronald Noe and Hammerstein in 1994 to refer to all the interactions between organisms in which different organisms function as 'traders' that exchange goods and services such as food and water, grooming, warning calls, shelter, etc. Biological market theory consists of five formal characteristics which present a basis for altruism.\n\n\nThe applicability of biological market theory with its emphasis on partner choice is evident in the interactions between the cleaner wrasse and its \"client\" reef fish. Cleaners have small territories, which the majority of reef fish species actively visit to invite inspection of their surface, gills, and mouth. Clients benefit from the removal of parasites while cleaners benefit from the access to a food source. Some particularly choosy client species have large home ranges that cover several cleaning stations, whereas other clients have small ranges and have access to one cleaning station only (resident clients). Field observations, field manipulations, and laboratory experiments revealed that whether or not a client has choice options influences several aspects of both cleaner and client behaviour. Cleaners give choosy clients priority of access. Choosy clients switch partners if cheated by a cleaner by taking a bite of out of the cleaner, whereas resident clients punish cheats. Cleaners and resident clients, but not choosy clients, build up relationships before normal cleaning interactions take place. Cleaners are particularly cooperative if choosy clients are bystanders of an interaction but less so when resident clients are bystanders.\n\nResearchers tested whether wild white-handed gibbon males from Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, increased their grooming activity when the female partner was fertile. Adult females and males of our study population are codominant (in terms of aggression), they live in pairs or small multi male groups and mate promiscuously. They found that males groomed females more than vice versa and more grooming was exchanged when females were cycling than during pregnancy or lactation. The number of copulations/day was elevated when females were cycling, and females copulated more frequently with males on days when they received more grooming. When males increased their grooming efforts, females also increased their grooming of males, perhaps to equalize give and take. Although grooming might be reciprocated because of intrinsic benefits of receiving grooming, males also interchange grooming as a commodity for sexual opportunities during a female's fertile period.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds, such as \"Dictyostelium mucoroides\". These protists live as individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.\n\n\n"}

The Dabhol plant was built through the combined effort of Enron as the majority share holder, and GE, and Bechtel as minority share holders. GE provided the generating turbines to Dabhol, Bechtel constructed the physical plant, and Enron was charged with managing the project through Enron International. From 1992 to 2001, the construction and operation of the plant was mired in controversies related to corruption in Enron and at the highest political levels in India and the United States (Clinton administration and Bush administration). The price that the state electricity board would have to pay for electricity produced by DPC (8 Rs/unit) was more than 20 times what it paid for hydroelectricity (Rs. 0.35/unit). \n\nIn 1998, MSEB purchased half of Enron's equity stake. In May 1999, the power plant began producing energy. In January 2001 the state of Maharashtra stopped paying DPC and sought to cancel the purchase agreement. In May 2001, the power plant ran into further trouble due to Enron scandal leading to the bankruptcy of Enron and had to stop production.\n\nIn 2005, it was taken over and revived by converting it into the RGPPL (Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private Limited), a company owned by the Government of India.\n\nStarting in the mid-1990s, Unocal and its partners planned to build a 1,000 mile gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Multan, in Pakistan at a cost of about $2 billion. Also considered was a route from Iran to Multan which was seen as feasible due to Iran's huge oil and gas reserves. However, In 1996 when the Sanctions against Iran were imposed, the FBI blocked the plan, and it was forcibly cancelled. A proposed 400 mile extension from Multan to New Delhi would bring some of the gas into India's network of gas pipelines at a cost of $600 million.\n\nA sea route from Gwadar, Pakistan, to Dabhol, India, was never considered despite both locations being coastal towns.\n\nIn 1992, Enron approached the government of Maharashtra with the idea of setting up a 2,184 Megawatts LNG powered plant at Dabhol, Ratnagiri. LNG for the project would be imported from Qatar through a 20 year contract with Enron, and the electricity produced would be purchased by the Government of Maharashtra for 20years. \n\nHowever, World Bank found issues with the feasibility of the project and hence refused to give a loan for the same. Instead the project was financed by Enron, Bechtel, GE and five major lenders, one of which was located in India:\n\nThe plant was to be constructed in two phases. In March 1995, the ruling Congress Party in Maharashtra lost to a nationalist coalition that had campaigned on an anti-foreign investment platform. In May, hundreds of protesting villagers swarmed over the site to protest the displacement of people that would take place, and a riot broke out. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International eventually charged the security forces guarding Dabhol for Enron with human-rights abuses; Human Rights Watch blamed Enron for being \"complicit.\" On August 3, the Maharashtra state government ordered the project to be halted because of \"lack of transparency, alleged padded costs, and environmental hazards.\" Construction ground to a halt. By then, Enron had invested about $300 million into the project.\n\nPhase one was set to burn naphtha, a fuel similar to kerosene and gasoline. Phase one would produce 740 megawatts and help stabilize the local transmission grid. The power plant's phase one project was started in 1992 and finally completed two years behind schedule.\n\nPhase two would burn liquefied natural gas (LNG). The LNG infrastructure associated with the LNG Terminal at Dabhol was going to cost around $1 billion.\n\nIn 1996 when India's Congress Party was no longer in power, the Indian government assessed the project as being excessively expensive and refused to pay for the plant and stopped construction. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the local state run utility, was required by contract to continue to pay Enron plant maintenance charges, even if no power was purchased from the plant. The MSEB determined that it could not afford to purchase the power (at Rs. 8 per unit kWh) charged by Enron. From 1996 until Enron's bankruptcy in 2001 the company tried to revive the project and spark interest in India's need for the power plant without success. The project was widely criticized for excess costs and deemed a white elephant. Socialist groups cited the project as an example of corporate profiteering over public good.\nOver the next year Enron reviewed its options. On February 23, 1996, the then government of Maharashtra and Enron announced a new agreement. Enron cut the price of the power by over 20 percent, cut total capital costs from $2.8 billion to $2.5 billion, and increased Dabhol's output from 2,015 megawatts to 2,184 megawatts. Both parties committed formally to develop the second phase. The first phase went online May 1999, almost two years behind schedule, and construction was started on phase two. Costs would now ultimately climb to $3 billion. Then everything came to halt. The MSEB refused to pay for all the power, and it became clear that getting the government to honor the guarantees would not be an easy task. Although Maharashtra still suffers from blackouts, it says it does not need and cannot afford Dabhol's power. India's energy sector still loses roughly $5 billion a year. This plant was taken over by Ratnagiri Gas and Power Private limited in July 2005.\n\nThe power plant Phase I which was renamed Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt Ltd (RGPPL) started operation in May 2006, after a hiatus of over 5 years. However, the Dabhol plant ran into further problems, with RGPPL shutting down the plant on 4 July 2006 due to a lack of naphtha supply. The Qatar based company RasGas Company Ltd. started supplying LNG to the plant in April 2007.\n\nThe Dabhol Power plant consists of 3 blocks, each consisting of two GE make frame 9 gas turbines and one GE steam turbine. Block 2 commissioning work and Gas turbine 2A trial runs started on 25 April 2007.\nThe Dabhol Power Plant Project was again made operational in April 2009 with 900 MW RLNG fired running capacity but problems continued due to non-availability of operational insurance. Decisions tend to be largely dependent upon political developments in the country as well as performance of newly repaired rotors. As of 2016, the company continues to operate at a colossal loss, selling expensive electricity to either the state owned MSEDCL or India railways for survival.\n\nIn September 2015, the company had a total debt of nearly Rs. 10,500 crore. In a bid to try and revive the loss making plant, the Company owning the power plant RGPPL was split into two separate Power (RGPPL) and LNG entities (Konkan LNG Private Limited (KLPL)), one to manage the power plant and the other to try and manage the import of LNG.\n\n\n"}

Taiwan's Ministry of Culture has listed the forest railway as a potential World Heritage Site.\n\nThe narrow gauge lines were originally constructed by the Japanese Colonial Government in 1912 to facilitate the logging of cypress and Taiwania wood. Passenger carriages were first added to the trains in 1918. The first motive power was a Shay locomotive purchased second hand from the Kiso Forest Railway in Japan. Eventually the railway acquired 20 Shay locomotives.\n\nEventually, diesel railcars supplemented the steam engines on the passenger services. In the 1980s, 10 Hitachi-built diesel-hydraulic locomotives were delivered and replaced the railcars and remaining steam engines.\n\nThe completion of the Alishan Highway in 1982 led to the loss of many rail passengers to faster and cheaper buses and the rail became primarily a tourist attraction.\n\nAccidents on the line have resulted in a number of fatalities over the years. On 24 April 1981, a collapsed tunnel resulted in nine deaths and 13 injuries. On 1 March 2003, 17 people were killed and 156 injured when a train derailed near Alishan Railway Station.

During the first millennium BCE, when the holder of this office exercised her largest measure of influence, her position was an important appointment facilitating the transfer of power from one pharaoh to the next, when his daughter was adopted to fill it by the incumbent office holder. The Divine Adoratrice ruled over the extensive temple duties and domains, controlling a significant part of the ancient Egyptian economy.\n\nGod's Wife of Amun, a title for a similar office of the high priestess, originated as a title held by a daughter of the High Priest of Amun during the reign of Hatshepsut and continued as an important office while the capital of Egypt remained in Thebes.\n\nLater, the added title Divine Adoratrice of Amun can be seen to accompany a resurgence of the title God's Wife of Amun, which had fallen into disuse. The God's Wife title was revived during the Twentieth Dynasty, when Ramesses VI's daughter Iset held the office, as well as the additional office of Divine Adoratrice. He reigned from 1145-1137 BC. She never married and seems to have been the first of the celibate holders of the office of \"Divine Adoratrice of Amun\", as he stipulated along with the new tradition that she would adopt the daughter of the succeeding pharaoh as her successor at the end of his reign in order to facilitate the transition to the next pharaoh. Generally, the tradition was followed and the position was filled by the daughter of the current king, who was adopted as the daughter of the incumbent Divine Adoratrice.\n\nThe new office reached the very heights of its political power during the late Third Intermediate Period of Egypt when Shepenupet I, Osorkon III's daughter, was first appointed to this post at Thebes. The Nubian king Kashta, in turn, appointed his daughter, Amenirdis, as her successor. The high status of this office is illustrated by the tomb of Amenirdis at Medinet Habu.[4]\n\nToward the end of the Third Intermediate Perion the Napatan kings from Kingdom of Kush, who reigned as the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, spread their realm into Upper Egypt. The reigning God's Wife of Amun, Shepenupet I, was persuaded to adopt Amenirdis, the daughter of Pharaoh Kashta of Kush as her heir. This sequence was followed throughout the 25th Dynasty until Egypt was conquered by the Saite king Psamtik I, who founded the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, who had his daughter, Nitocris I, adopted by Amenirdis II. The Adoption Stela of Nitocris shows the ceremony involved by this event, and the prestige of the role.\n\nAt this time, the dynastic rulers were based in the Nile Delta region, and the office of the Divine Adoratrice was a means to secure peaceful relations with the Theban area where the cult of Amun was centered. A number of the God's Wives had mortuary shrines constructed on the west bank of the river, mostly alongside the mortuary temple at Medinet Habu of Ramesses III.\n\nBecause of the power and prestige of the offices, the ceremony of adoption by the current incumbent of the post was used as a way for the kings of the Delta area to project their power into the south of Egypt. In the same manner, it was used by the Napatan kings to project their power northward into Egypt proper. The power of the Divine Adoratrice of Amun was limited to the area around Thebes in Upper Egypt, which was the center of the cult.\n\n\n"}

It can be made of many plastics, but vinyl is most popular, as it stretches well and gives an effective and long lasting insulation. Electrical tape for class H insulation is made of fiberglass cloth.\n\nA wide variety of electrical tapes is available; some for highly specialized purposes. \"The primary tapes used in electrical applications are vinyl, rubber, mastic, and varnished cambric.\" Electricians generally use only black tape for insulation purposes. The other colors are used to indicate the voltage level and phase of the wire. (In fact, the colored tape is referred to as \"phasing tape.\") This is done on large wire which is available only in black insulation. When wires are phased, a ring of tape is placed on each end near the termination so that the purpose of the wire is obvious. The following table(s) describe the use of electrical tape.\nTape that is approved for electrical applications will carry an approval label from an agency such as Underwriters Laboratories. \n\nToday electrical tape is simply, \"another form of insulation\". The original electrical insulating tape was made of cloth tape impregnated with Chatterton's compound, an adhesive material manufactured using Gutta-percha. This type of tape was often used to insulate soldered splices on knob and tube wiring. It was commonly referred to as \"friction tape\", and had the unique property of being sticky on both sides. Because of this, no matter how it was used it stuck to itself very readily.\n\nIn the early 1940s, vinyl plastic emerged as a versatile material for a wide range of applications, from shower curtains to cable insulation. A major ingredient in vinyl film was tricresyl phosphate (TCP), which was used as a plasticizer. Unfortunately, TCP tended to migrate, giving the surface of the vinyl film an oily quality and degrading every tape adhesive known. Research chemists and engineers at 3M set out to create a dependable, pressure-sensitive tape made of vinyl film that would have the required electrical, physical and chemical properties.\n\nExperiments were conducted combining new plasticizers with the white, flour-like vinyl resin. Finally, in January 1946, inventors Snell, Oace, and Eastwold of 3M applied for a patent for a vinyl electrical tape with a plasticizer system and non-sulfur-based rubber adhesive that were compatible. The first commercially available version of the tape was sold for use as a wire-harness wrapping. This original electrical tape wasn't black. Tapes formulated for high-temperature were yellow, and later versions were white. Electrically insulating tapes are essential for enhancing functionality and reliability in a wide range of applications. Some of the most popular types include electrically insulating adhesive tape and electrically insulating film, both of which provide reliable electronic isolation and ensure that direct electrical connection is not made between two or more circuits or their adjacent parts. There is also electrically conducting tape for shielding and similar applications. White tape, because of its instability in ultraviolet light, was eventually replaced with black tape, although colored vinyl tapes are still used as identification and marking tapes. Black became the standard industry color for vinyl standard tape, primarily because of its ultraviolet resistance. Thicknesses originally were 4 mil (100 µm), 8 mil (200 µm) and 12 mil (300 µm). These were standardized to 7 mil (180 µm) and 10 mil (250 µm) in 1948.\n\n\n"}

The first African-American to have a major cosmetics contract, Webb has appeared on covers of \"Vogue\", \"Essence\" and \"Elle\" magazines and on the runway for Victoria's Secret and Chanel.\n\nWebb was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Marion (née Stewart), a public health doctor , and Leonard Douglas Webb, an electrician. Prior to her birth, both her parents spent 20 years in the Army. She grew up in a working class community. One of Webb's sisters became an oncologist and another is a mathematician.\n\nAs a youth, Webb identified with magazine models and women who were involved in the fashion industry, who exhibited control over their appearance. She also enjoyed comic books and dreamed of becoming an animator.\n\nWebb graduated in 1983 from the Detroit Waldorf School and moved to New York to study design. After a makeup artist saw her in a housewares boutique, Webb dropped out of school to become a model.\nShe also appeared in the music video for New Order's \"Round and Round\" off their 1989 album \"Technique\" and appears briefly in Scritti Politti's \"Perfect Way\" video from their 1985 album \"Cupid & Psyche 85\".\n\nIn New York, Webb pursued a modeling career and eventually became a spokesmodel for Revlon. She was the first black supermodel to win an exclusive contract for a major cosmetics company. In 1991 Webb made her feature film debut in Spike Lee's \"Jungle Fever\". Her film credits include \"Someone Like You...\", \"The Big Tease\", and \"Malcolm X\". She also had a recurring role on the television show \"Damon\" and appeared on \"Just Shoot Me!\", \"Becker\" and \"Clueless\". In 2006, Webb appeared in the independent feature film \"Dirty Laundry\".\n\nAs a runway model she has modeled fashions from the collections of Azzedine Alaia, Isaac Mizrahi, Karl Lagerfeld, and Todd Oldham. Webb was named to American Vogue's best dressed list three times.\n\nWebb has written essays and columns for \"Interview\" magazine, \"Paper Magazine\" (\"New York City's style guide to downtown cool\"), \"Panorama\" (an Italian weekly news magazine), \"Details\", \"Elle\", \"The Sunday Times\", \"The New York Times Syndicate\", Conde Nast's \"Cookie\" magazine, and \"Esquire\".\n\nIn 1995, she modeled for the first annual show of Victoria's Secret. \n\nIn 1998, Miramax Books published \"Veronica Webb Sight: Adventures In The Big City\", a collection of autobiographical essays. Harvey Weinstein, chairman of Miramax, approached her while she was in line at the White House about publishing her essays as a memoir.\n\nWebb was the co-host of the first season of Bravo's \"Tim Gunn's Guide To Style\".\n\nIn 2010, Webb was named a member of the Eucerin Skin First Council to promote skin health.\n\nWebb learned French from Azzedine Alaia with whom she lived during her stay in Paris.\n\nWebb dedicates her time to several charitable organizations: LIFEBeat, Product Red and the RPM Nautical Foundation. LIFEBeat is close to Webb's heart because she was deeply affected by the AIDs crisis in the 80's as a model living in New York. Webb got involved with RPM because of her ex-husband, George Robb, who works to bring up shipwrecks for museums and governments.\n\nWebb married George Robb in 2002 and had daughters Leila Rose Robb (born October 2002) and Molly Blue Robb (born May 2004). The couple divorced in 2009. She is currently engaged to Chris Delgatto. \nWebb's hobby is decorating—colors and textiles, and traveling. She also collects shipwreck artifacts and textiles from around the world.\n\nWebb ran the ING New York City Marathon for the first time in 2009 and ran for Harlem United Community AIDS Center.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2021636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021636", "title": "Federal Arbitration Act", "text": "Federal Arbitration Act\n\nThe United States Arbitration Act (, codified at ), more commonly referred to as the Federal Arbitration Act or FAA, is an act of Congress that provides for judicial facilitation of private dispute resolution through arbitration. It applies in both state courts and federal courts, as was held in \"Southland Corp. v. Keating\". It applies where the transaction contemplated by the parties \"involves\" interstate commerce and is predicated on an exercise of the Commerce Clause powers granted to Congress in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe FAA provides for contract based compulsory and binding arbitration, resulting in an \"arbitration award\" entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel as opposed to a \"judgment\" entered by a court of law. In an arbitration, the parties give up the right to an appeal on substantive grounds to a court.\n\nOnce an award is entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel, it must be \"confirmed\" in a court of law; and once confirmed, the award is reduced to an enforceable judgment, which may be enforced by the winning party in court, like any other judgment. Under the FAA, an award must be confirmed within one year, and any objection to an award must be challenged by the losing party within three months. An arbitration agreement may be entered \"prospectively\" (ie., in advance of any actual dispute), or may be entered into by the disputing parties once a dispute has arisen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in \"Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.\" that the grounds for judicial review specified in the FAA may not be expanded, even if the parties to the arbitration agreement agree to allow expanded review of the decision.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, the Court ruled in \"American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant\" that class action waivers contained in mandatory arbitration clauses were valid even if plaintiffs prove that it would not be economically practicable to maintain these actions individually.\n\nIn its decision on \"Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis\" on May 21, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the FAA is not overridden by the protection of concerted activity established by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, effectively making individual arbitration agreements in contracts wholly enforceable.\n\nWithin \"New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira\", decided in January 2019, the Court decided unanimously that when contracts include mandatory arbitration clauses, employees still have the right to seek court oversight to determine if such employment falls within the exceptions outlined in §1 of the FAA related to employees involved in interstate commerce, and that these protections apply to both those classified as employees and as independent contractors.\n\nSection 2 of the FAA declares that arbitration provisions will be subject to invalidation only for the same grounds applicable to contractual provisions generally, such as unconscionability or duress. Consequently, most state law that disfavors the enforcement of arbitration agreements will be preempted by the FAA. State laws that govern the procedures of arbitration, but do not affect its enforcement, are outside the Act's preemptive scope.\n\nNot all state laws regarding arbitration are preempted, for example:\n\nHowever, a recent Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Office of Hearing Officers (OHO) decision in a disciplinary action against Charles Schwab & Co. questions the ability of a regulator to enforce arbitration agreement restrictions such as NASD Rule 12204 (FINRA Rule 2268). The dispute arose when Charles Schwab & Co. revised its pre-dispute arbitration agreement to preclude a customer from participating in a class action against the firm, effectively removing the ability for a customer to have a claim heard in court. FINRA rules require arbitration through a FINRA arbitration panel, except in the case of class actions, which are reserved for the court system.\n\nSpecifically, the OHO Panel cited the Supreme Court decision in \"Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon\" that securities law claims are no exception to the FAA's mandate that parties to an otherwise valid arbitration agreement submit the claim to arbitration. The OHO Panel also applied the Supreme Court decision in \"AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion\" where the Court established that class actions also are not an exception to the FAA, stating that a party to an arbitration agreement has no right to participate in a class action instead of an arbitration on an individual basis and that an exception to the FAA's mandate requires clear expression of Congressional intent. FINRA has appealed the OHO decision to the National Adjudicatory Council.\n\nA case-by-case analysis is required to determine whether a specific California law is preempted. In general where the FAA has no procedural provisions applicable in state court, there is no preemption.\n\nA number of Supreme Court cases have dealt with the preemption of state laws by the Federal Arbitration Act:\n\nFollowing on a number of recent Supreme Court decisions that found in favor of employers in arbitration disputes, Democrats in both houses of Congress introduced the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act (FAIR Act) in February 2019. The bill proposed would modify the FAA to make any contract that requires forced arbitration invalid, outside of limited conditions, making judges the decision-making body in disputes where arbitration may be required, and prevent employment contracts from blocking the employee's engagement with labor unions due to arbitration. The bill was introduced following events at several large tech firms, including Google that led to the companies eliminating forced arbitration from their employee contracts.\n\n"}

One of Britten's three \"Parables for Church Performances\", this work received its premiere at the St Bartholomew's Church, Orford, Suffolk, England, on 9 June 1966 by the English Opera Group.\n\nColin Graham was the stage director of this first production. Set designs were by Annena Stubbs. The United States premiere was presented at the Caramoor Summer Music Festival on 25 June 1967 with Andrea Velis as Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nThe scale and manner of instrumentation are similar to those in \"Curlew River\", but one notable difference is the use of the alto trombone.\n\nClifford Hindley has commented on a reading of a subtext sympathetic to homosexuality on the part of both Britten and Plomer in their treatment of the story.\n\n\"The Burning Fiery Furnace\" tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar (the historical Nebuchadnezzar II) and the three Israelites, Ananias, Misael and Asarias (corresponding Babylonian names: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego), who were thrown into a furnace for their refusal to worship Nebuchadnezzar's image of gold. However, God saves them from death, as the voice of an angel joins the Israelites in a 'Benedicite'.\n\nBritten himself, along with Viola Tunnard, supervised the first commercial recording of this work, for Decca/London, with the following participants:\nThe instrumentalists were Richard Adeney (flute), Neill Sanders (horn), Roger Brenner (trombone), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), Keith Marjoram (double bass), Osian Ellis (harp), James Blades (percussion) and Philip Ledger (organ).\n\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "2021638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021638", "title": "KFBG (FM)", "text": "KFBG (FM)\n\nKFBG (100.7 FM, \"100.7 Big FM\") is a commercial radio station that is licensed to San Diego, California, and broadcasts an adult hits format. The station is owned by Local Media San Diego. It shares studios with LMSD's other stations in the Sorrento Valley section of San Diego, and its transmitter is atop Mount Soledad in La Jolla.\n\nA sister station to existing AM station KFMB under the ownership of Transcontinent Television Corporation, the station signed on as KFMB-FM on 100.7 FM on September 21, 1959, initially with a jazz format. A previous KFMB-FM station signed on in April 1947 and broadcast until 1950 on 101.5 MHz. By the summer of 1960, KFMB-FM transitioned to beautiful music, which the station described as the \"golden sound of refined musical fare.\" In 1964, Transcontinent sold the KFMB-AM-FM-TV cluster to Midwest Television, a company controlled by the Meyer family and based in Champaign, Illinois at the time. In the late 1960s, the format was called \"Music only for a woman\"; station manager Eddie \"Ed\" Peters bought the rights to syndicate the format. Soon after, Peters left and started his own jingle company, Peters Productions, which syndicated the format on reel-to-reel tape to over 100 stations during the 1960s and 1970s, changing the name of the format to \"Music just for the two of us\".\n\nFollowing the trend of FM radio stations taking on top 40 formats in the early 1970s, KFMB program director Bobby Rich and station manager Paul Palmer decided to launch a top 40 station on KFMB-FM to challenge market leader KCBQ (1170 AM). Rich wanted to change the call letters to something with a \"Q\" in them to become \"the FM Q\", but the owners refused to break up the KFMB-AM-FM-TV matched set of call signs. In March 1975, KFMB-FM became \"B-100\" with the slogan \"Better Boogie\"; Southern California radio writer Richard Wagoner described the new station as a \"high-energy screamer [that] went straight for the jugular.\" In the fall 1977 Arbitron ratings, KFMB-FM became the first FM station to be no. 1 in a major media market.\n\nB-100's on-air staff during its first two years included \"Shotgun\" Tom Kelly, Kenny \"Beaver Cleaver\" Levine, and Bobby Rich under his on air name \"Dr. Boogie\". Later, some DJs left to launch top 40 outlet KTNQ (Ten-Q) in Los Angeles.\n\nB-100 had major success in the 1980s, reinventing itself as one of the nation's first ever hot adult contemporary (hot AC) stations. It melded top 40 hits (omitting some teen-oriented songs) with an adult delivery by its high-profile air staff. The day started with \"The B-100 Morning Zoo\" starring Bobby Rich, Scott Kenyon, Pat Gaffey, and Frank Anthony — collectively known as \"The Rich Brothers\". Other personalities from this era included Gary Kelley, Gene Knight (who is now heard on KXSN), Danny Romero (who eventually landed at KABC-TV in Los Angeles), Ellen K. Thomas, and John Fox.\n\nJeff and Jer became the new morning drive hosts at B-100 in 1991, but would leave in April 1993 for KKLQ-FM. Replacing them were John Landers and Jools Brandt, followed by Larry Himmel, who had also succeeded \"Shotgun\" Tom Kelly in mornings on B-100 in 1979. After Jeff and Jer departed, the station's ratings began to decline.\n\nOn May 16, 1994, Midwest Television announced that KFMB-FM would change formats. After the announcement, the station began a 3-week stunt dubbed \"The Great Radio Experiment\", where the station tested formats such as all-1970s hits, country, all-Elvis, modern rock, \"party songs\", an \"MTV\"-style top 40 format, classic rock, all-Motown, and children's music, each lasting for a day, and allowed listeners to vote for the new format. On June 6 at midnight, KFMB-FM relaunched as \"Star 100.7\" and retained the hot AC format, though with a more current and upbeat focus than B-100.\n\nStar 100.7 was a personality-oriented station, with an initial air staff made up of Shawn Ireland and Donna Davis in mornings, Kim Morrison in middays, Dave Smiley in afternoons, Dominica in evenings, and China More in overnights. Later on, the station's air staff consisted of Jeff and Jer (who returned in May 1997) in mornings, Anita Rush in middays, XHRM-FM morning hosts Jagger and Kristi in afternoons (after they left for KMYI in 2002, they would be replaced with Gregg Simms, Jen Sewell and Sara Kiani), and Ricky Lopez at nights (who would later be replaced with a repeat of Jeff and Jer dubbed \"Jeff and Jer Primetime\"). The station also aired the \"Bob and Sheri\" syndicated morning drive show in the early morning hours for a brief period in late 2004 and early 2005 (the show broadcasts from Charlotte, North Carolina in the Eastern Time Zone).\n\n\"Star 100.7\" continued until April 6, 2005 at 9:55 a.m., when the station began stunting with a five-minute ticking clock and a mysterious voice saying \"closer...closer\", which ended with an alarm going off and a female announcer saying \"Bye Star\". At that point, \"Jack FM\" and its adult hits format was introduced with R.E.M.'s \"It's The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine).\" Jeff and Jer left KFMB-FM in August 2005 and moved across town to KMYI (94.1 FM), now known as \"Star 94.1\". On August 2, 2010, KFMB-FM became home to the former longtime KGB-FM morning show, \"Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw\", often abbreviated \"The DSC\".\n\nOn August 2, 2013, KFMB-FM began restricting access to its online stream to listeners within the city of San Diego proper. This move by program director Mike O'Reilly drew the ire of fans who live outside the city limits, including the large U.S. military community stationed locally and overseas. O'Reilly explained his rationale, citing a new Arbitron policy on how online listening is measured:\n\nKFMB-FM achieved this effect by restricting the signal based on the IP address of the mobile phone on which a listener streamed the station. However, fans within the city of San Diego were prevented from hearing the station as well. In addition, the station charged for access to its local morning radio show on podcast in September 2013.\n\nIn January 2014, the station's sound evolved from the adult hits format by adding more current and recent hits, dropping most songs recorded before 2000 other than those by established modern rock artists such as Green Day, INXS, and U2. In April 2014, Mediabase added KFMB-FM to its hot AC panel, reflecting its shift from adult hits to a modern rock-leaning hot AC format.\n\nTypically, Jack FM stations do not have disc jockeys. However, in September 2005, KFMB-FM conducted a nationwide search for morning show talent, with the winner receiving a $1-million, five-year contract. The station chose Hispanic comedian Monique Marvez and former Star 100.7 DJs Greg and Sara. The show was called \"Monique and the Man\"; Greg was the 'Man' and Sara was a co-host. The show started on January 23, 2006 and ended in 2009. KFMB-FM had no morning show until \"Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw\" took over on August 2, 2010. The show, previously on KGB-FM, helped boost the station's morning ratings.\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Midwest Television announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with Local Media San Diego LLC, which operates three stations licensed to Tijuana but broadcasting in English for the San Diego media market: XETRA-FM (91.1 FM), XHITZ-FM (90.3 FM), and XHRM-FM (92.5 FM). The five stations formed an entity known as SDLocal, which was intended to \"preserve the local ownership and operation of San Diego's top-rated radio stations\".\n\nOn November 17, 2015, KFMB-FM began airing an all-Christmas music format for the holiday season as \"Jack Frost\". On December 8, Garrett Michaels, formerly program director at XETRA-FM, was named to the same position at KFMB-FM. With the announcement, there were possible hints of an upcoming format change. While \"Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw\" was usually ranked in first place among morning-drive programs, particularly among listeners 25–54 years old, KFMB-FM overall was ranked #17 in the December 2015 Nielsen Audio ratings report for the San Diego market. On December 26, 2015 at 10 a.m., after playing \"Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)\" by the Ramones, KFMB-FM began stunting with a \"Wheel of Formats\" — consisting of all-AC/DC, all-Bob Marley, all-1980s hits, all-Van Halen, outlaw country, soft adult contemporary, all-glam metal, all-blues, and adult standards — branded simply as \"100.7\", with each new format starting every day at 10 a.m. The stunt lasted until January 4, when the station settled on a mainstream rock format consisting of a mix of classic rock and 1970s/1980s new wave hits. This was branded as \"100.7 KFM-BFM\", a nod to how the station referred to its call letters in the 1980s. The first song on KFM-BFM was \"The Spirit of Radio\" by Rush.\n\nMidwest Television and Local Media San Diego ended the SDLocal joint operating agreement at the end of 2016.\n\nIn October 2017, San Diego television station KUSI-TV reported that KFMB-AM-FM-TV were being offered for sale by Midwest Television. On December 18, 2017, Tegna, Inc. announced it would purchase the KFMB stations for $325 million; the deal marked Tegna's re-entry into radio, as predecessor Gannett Company had sold its previous radio group to Evergreen Media in 1997. The sale was completed on February 15, 2018.\n\nThe last edition of \"Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw\" aired July 19, 2018. The hosts' contracts were set to expire at the end of the month, but KFMB-FM failed to reach new deals with hosts Dave Rickards and Cookie \"Chainsaw\" Randolph. Shelly Dunn had announced her retirement from radio the previous week.\n\nIn December 2018, KFMB-FM flipped back to adult hits as \"100.7 San Diego\". In January 2019, it was announced that Chris Cantore (coming from KBZT) would begin hosting mornings. \n\nOn December 30, 2019, Tegna reached an agreement to sell KFMB-AM-FM to Local Media San Diego for $5 million, putting them back under common control with its three Mexican-licensed stations. The deal broke up the KFMB station cluster after 60 years and did not include the rights to the KFMB call letters. Local Media entered into a 10-year lease of the transmitter site on Mount Soledad as part of the sale. On January 28, 2020, ahead of the closure, it was announced that the entire airstaff would be exiting on February 7, 2020, which was when they expected the sale to be closed. However, it was later revealed that their staff would remain in place through at least February 14; regulatory approval of the sale faced delays due to several factors, including the required publication of public notices of the proposal being delayed due to an \"inadvertent scheduling oversight\". The sale was ultimately approved on March 12, 2020, and was completed on March 17, 2020; while KFMB (AM) was immediately divested to iHeartMedia, no immediate changes were disclosed for KFMB-FM, other than a planned relocation to LMSD's Sorrento Valley studios.\n\nOn April 13, 2020, at noon, the station rebranded as \"100.7 Big FM\", featuring what it said was \"a bigger music library\", but no on-air staff, as the station will remain jockless. The first song on Big FM was \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen. To match the new brand, the station's call sign was changed to KFBG. The studios also relocated to Sorrento Valley.\n\n"}
{"id": "2021644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021644", "title": "Rennell Island", "text": "Rennell Island\n\nRennell Island, locally known as Mugaba, is the main island of two inhabited islands that make up the Rennell and Bellona Province in the Solomon Islands. Rennell Island has a land area of that is about long and wide. It is the second largest raised coral atoll in the world with the largest lake in the insular Pacific, Lake Tegano, a lake that is listed as a World Heritage Site. Rennell Island has a population of about 1,840 persons of Polynesian descent who primarily speak Rennellese, Pijin and some English. Rennell and Bellona Islands are two of the few islands in the Melanesian Solomon Island archipelago classified as a Polynesian outlier; others being Sikaiana, Ontong Java, Tikopia, Anuta, Duff Islands, and some Reef Islands.\n\nThe island lies south of Honiara and north-east of Brisbane. The provincial capital, Tigoa, is at the western end of the island.\n\nBetween 2000 and 1600 BC, people belonging to the Lapita Culture made their appearance. Then by Lapita people about 1000 BC. The next settlement occurred on both Rennell and Bellona around 130 BC, with another major occupation in about 1000 AD.\n\nLater settlement of Renbel occurred prior to 1400 AD by Polynesians from Uvea, now Wallis Island. Captain Butler of HMS Walpole discovered the islands in 1801, after discovering and naming Walpole Island in New Caledonia. In 1933 the Templeton Crocker Expedition discovered several endemic species on the islands. During the Pacific campaign of World War II Japanese Rufe floatplanes operated from Lake Tegano until American Catalinas used the lake as a base after 1943. The Battle of Rennell Island was the last major naval battle of the Guadacanal Campaign which occurred between 29 January 1943 and 30 January 1943. At the end of the war, eight Catalinas were scuttled in the lake and can be seen from the lake surface. The island was later visited by a series of Danish scientific expeditions.\n\nThe present-day inhabitants say their ancestors, Kaitu'u, arrived around 1400AD from Ubea, now Wallis & Futuna Islands, crossed the Pacific Ocean and settled on Rennell and Bellona Islands, in the Solomon Islands. One of the villages in Lake Tegano is called Hutuna which is the Rennellese interpretation of Wallis & Futuna\n\nThe islands are of volcanic origin with basement rocks forming between the late Cretaceous and early Eocene. Tectonic movements raised the seabed to allow coral building. The whole Rennell area is thought to have been initially deposited as coralline algal limestone and then dolotomized. This dolomitic reef complex is overlain by younger undolotomized reef limestone. The island is the second largest upraised coral atoll in the world. It is largely unmodified and includes the largest lake in the South Pacific.\n\nThe island is about one hour's flight in a twin engine prop aircraft south of Honiara. It is almost totally surrounded by cliffs, with the eastern end dominated by a large lake, while the western end is relatively flat with rolling forested hills. One road, known as the Copperhead Road, traverses the length of the island from the Tigoa airstrip in the west to the Labagu port area in the south, with a branch heading east towards the lake.\n\nKangava Bay has beautiful white sands beach and coral reef which makes it good for snorkeling.\n\nOfficial Solomon Island maps name this lake Te Nggano, while locals refer to the lake as Tegano or Tungano or Big Water. The lake is in length and wide, with an area of , which occupies 17.6% of the total area of Rennell Island. The lake is located at East Rennell, the southern portion of Rennell Island, in the central basin which was the old lagoon.\n\nThe hard bottom is covered by several meters of suspended mud. The lake has an elevated salt concentration being kept by a subterranean duct system which connects it with the sea.\n\nThe water depth is and consists of a mixture of brackish fresh and salt water. The average distance from the lake shore to the ocean is with wildlife predominantly eels and water snakes and a bird breeding area. The lake is listed as a World Heritage Site.\n\nOn the easternmost point of the lake is the former World War 2 airbase Tigoa. Information from locals claims that there are nine aircraft at the bottom of the lake with five visible from a boat.\n\nLake Te Nggano was used as a flying boat base by both Japanese and American forces during the Pacific War (World War II). Japanese Nakajima A6M2-N \"Rufe\" floatplanes operated out of Rennell Island until US air and sea superiority made the base untenable. American PBY Catalinas used the lake as a base after 1943. A detachment from the 2nd Marines was sent from New Hebrides and arrived at Lake Tegano on 12 November 1942 to establish a lookout post.\n\nThe US forces scuttled eight of the warhorses at the end of hostilities rather than take them home. Reports were made of crash landings due to the coral outcrops within the lake. Members of the local community attempted to retrieve one of the radial engines of the aircraft to use as a generator using only man-power. First it was cut from the wing by diving with snorkels and using hand-tools.\n\nIt was then dragged across the coralline rock lake floor by hand-winch. They were overcome in their task by the engine's tremendous weight. They did manage to get it close to the shoreline before giving up, close enough that one of the propeller blades is exposed to the air. Very quickly however, the engine became unusable through corrosion, so further attempts to bring it ashore were abandoned.\n\nThe temperature averages with about of rainfall per year and high humidity during both seasons. South-east trade winds prevail from April to the end of November. The island lies within the band of known cyclone paths and is subject to cyclones at relatively frequent intervals. The latest major cyclone to hit Rennell was Nina in 1993.\n\nThe islands of Rennell and Bellona are unique within the Solomon Islands, sharing similarities with New Caledonia and Australia as much as the Solomons. They are home to several endemic species, including the Rennell starling (\"Aplonis insularis\") which is a species of starling in the family Sturnidae, the bare-eyed white-eye (\"Woodfordia superciliosa\") which is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae, the Rennell shrikebill (\"Clytorhynchus hamlini\") which is a species of bird in the family Monarchidae, and the Rennell fantail (\"Rhipidura rennelliana\") which is also a species of bird in the family Rhipiduridae. The Solomons white ibis (\"Threskiornis molucca pygmaeus\") is a dwarf subspecies of the Australian white ibis that is endemic to Rennell and Bellona Islands.\n\nRennell province also has 25 species of ants, the endemic orchid \"Dendrobium rennellii\" near Lake Tegano, two endemic species of \"Pandanus\" (\"P. lacustris\" and \"P. rennellensis\").[] There are also 11 species of bats in the area including the Rennell flying fox (\"Pteropus rennelli\") which is endemic to the island.\n\nLake Tegano is the only known location for the endemic sea krait \"Laticauda crockeri\" (VU), one of only two known freshwater sea snake species in the world. The other species of sea snake in the lake is \"Laticauda colubrina.\" There are five species of geckos, four skinks, the Rennell monitor (\"Varanus juxtindicus\") and three snakes, all of which are species with widespread distributions and are typical of the region. There are 27 species of land snails, seven of which are endemic to the island, coconut crab (\"Birgus latro\") (DD) and two other species of land hermit crabs (\"Coenobita\" spp.). A total of 731 insects have been identified from collections made at Rennell and Bellona. Moths (Lepidoptera) have the greatest number of species (246 in total) with 35 species and 25 subspecies exclusive to Rennell and Bellona. Renbel has no indigenous malaria, cane toads, vipers or crocodiles.\n\nDue to the tropical climate and thinly soiled coralline substrate, sheep and cattle do not thrive here. Villagers wishing to harvest seafood have the arduous task of climbing the surrounding cliffs for the return journey to the coast. Once at the coast, they are bound to harvest only finned and scaled seafood, not shellfish, lobsters or other marine creatures. The serious deficiency in diet prompted the Solomon Islands government to seed Lake Nggano with tilapia fish. These seem to have thrived in the brackish conditions and are now a staple part of the diet. While coconut crabs are crustaceans, and use the sea to spawn, the Seventh-day Adventists do not eat it in accordance with the kosher laws in but a few are tempted to its taste, and also enjoying harvesting it.\n\nThe locals also talk about a condition they refer to as \"The Cold\". They believe that this ailment is responsible for the onset of a debilitating mental illness. Adults who have no history of mental illnesses or drug abuse have been known to slide into a state of melancholy, requiring weeks of intensive treatment.\n\nThe wantok system creates huge pressures on the people of Renbel, more so than many other provinces. You will often hear the locals remark \"Oh, that’s the Avaiki way\". This refers to the intrinsic behaviour associated with the wantok system and translates to \"What is yours, is mine\"\n\nThe locals play sport most days of the week in the afternoons. Soccer, rugby, volleyball & netball are the sports of choice.\n\nThe natives call Rennell \"MUGAVA\" and they call Bellona \"MUNGIKI\". They then combine the last three letters of each Island and come up with a word called AVAIKI. If someone local does something silly you might hear someone say ‘That’s the Avaiki way’. They also have a Rugby and Net ball team called Avaiki.\n\nThe locals don't have much respect for chiefs but most respect the Church leaders. They don't like the politicians much because, as soon as they get elected, they move to Honiara and only show up again when it's time to get re-elected.\n\nWhen an outsider enters a village there appears to be no apparent hierarchy and it is acceptable to talk to either men or women. The people who hold important jobs here are the religious leaders and teachers. The chiefs are not really respected here and are said to wield no real power. This view of chiefs as powerless is sparked by grandchildren of the commoners, who are now well educated these days and want to retaliate for their ancestors held traditional views.\n\nThe second island that makes up Renbel province is Bellona Island (pop. under 1000) thereby giving rise to the provincial name REN-BEL.\n\nThe Renbel province covers a land area of . The province or Renbell was established in 1993 where it was revealed that 99% of the land is customarily owned with only the main road and Bellona airfield being owned by the government.\n\nTigoa (Tingoa) is the capital for Rennell Island and located at the Rennell Airfield. It is referred by the locals as TNT and has a population of about 400 people. A number of residences are built either side of the airfield. Both the Royal Solomon Island Police and the Provincial Government offices are stationed at Tigoa.\n\nThe traditional chief system does not operate in the province.\n\nThe Provincial Government are tasked with providing health, education, transport, power, water and other basic services. They are funded with about $128,000 per month from the Central Government to do this.\n\nThe Government structure has 10 wards each with elected members:\n\n\"Rennell Ward\"\n\n\"Bellona Ward\"\n\nThe Provincial Government is also responsible for the appointment of area constables to police local by-laws.\n\nIn Renbell province, a great majority of land disputes are over farming plots. Many villages are used as gardening villages (subsistence farming) since the population has moved to larger neighboring villages. The farming plots are carved out of the forest and farming paths carved to reach the plots. The soil from a coral atoll is not as fertile as other islands such as the volcanic Guadalcanal. Often the boundaries of these plots are guessed which gives rise to the various disputes.\n\nThe crops grown include sweet potato and slippery cabbage and to a lesser extent, taro. In the 1990s a virus decimated the taro crops and now crops are under threat by a more natural enemy. At the arrival of RAMSI in 2004, all Solomon Islanders were encouraged to hand-in their firearms following the period of ethnic tensions and many farmers who had used guns to protect their crops were also required to surrender their guns. In 2008 many farmers now complain that the native bird tekagae, kagae or rednose (NZ is known as\nswamp hen or pukeko) \"has tripled in population since the gun amnesty\". Apparently the Tekagae can't be eaten and is very clever, being able to sense the arrival of a person and counteract any efforts of deterrence such as scarecrows or ribbon and \"many families have gone hungry and many farmers have given up trying to farm and we appeal to RAMSI to serious consider appropriate action\".\n\nThe people of the Renbell Province have a subsistence farming lifestyle. Their daily activities are focused on farming of the family's personal garden and regular attendance at churches.\n\nThe majority of residents of the Renbell province are Renbellanise of Polynesian descent. The Rennell and Bellona languages are very similar and closely related to New Zealand Maori and Samoan languages. Most adults speak Solomon Pijin, although children and some unschooled young persons will only be comfortable speaking Renbelian (Polynesian language), and most have some understanding of English.\n\nBoth the islands of Rennell and Bellona are serviced by the Tigoa police station. The gazetted strength of the police station is meant to be 12.\n\nAs of September 2008, the actual strength is 5.\n\nThe Tigoa Police station was originally built in 1993 and soon after was destroyed by Cyclone Nina. The replacement police station was condemned by the Royal Solomon Islands Police (RSIP) logistics department in 2008.\n\nAs part of RAMSI, there are two Participating Police Force (PPF) advisors stationed at Rennell Island, Tigoa. A semi-permanent ITSA structure provides accommodation which was officially opened by the RAMSI PPF Commander on 8 September 2004 and later a section which accommodates the Tigoa police station, was opened on 12 March 2008.\n\nPower to the complex is provided by a 24-hour Kubota generator powering a split system Air-Conditioning, hot water, full kitchen appliances and washing facilities in the laundry/Bathroom. The accommodation/Office houses the HF radio, base sat phone and computer equipment used by PPF members.\n\nThe RSIP residences are situated at the back of the PPF Compound including the previously condemned police station. There are 5 current houses standing and most have nil wet areas or ablution facilities available. Some of these facilities have been built by RSIP officers themselves as there is no maintenance work conducted by RSIP management.\n\nRSIP hold a sea worthy fibreglass banana boat which is used for transport on Lake Te’Nggano with a modern and well maintained 25HP OBM. This is an efficient and functional means of transport for RAMSI/RSIP between the head road and the 4 lake villages of East Rennell Island. Currently the Marine fuel for these patrols is provided by RSIP so patrols of Rennell can be completed. They also have a banana boat station at Lavangu which is seaworthy and operates with a 40HP Yamaha O/B. Both O/Bs are stored at the PPF compound in the RSIP container with servicing and parts for the boats and OBMs supplied by the RSIP.\n\nA modified shipping container is utilised as a cell/watch-house until the offender is evacuated to Honiara.\n\nIn 1992 a Tigoa police officer with 4 passengers was sailing from Rennell to Bellona in a banana boat and did not return. No bodies were ever recovered yet the following year in January 1993, the banana boat was located during or after Cyclone Nina. It was located in the western province area, near Gizo.\n\nThe level of crime is generally very low with land disputes and homebrew being the main cause behind offences committed. Often disputes involve logging and farming plots.\n\nSince June 2006, there have been very few drunk and disorderly incidents reported to the police. This is primarily due to the lack of sugar and yeast on the island which is required to make home brew. There is generally a surge in home brewing activity following the arrival of the resupply ship. Local home brew is made by fermenting coconut milk, yeast and sugar in a bin and leaving it hidden in the bush for about a week. It is normally drunk on Thursday night after sports day which often leads to disorderly behavior such as fights, noise, loud music, etc.\n\nThe religion of Bellona Island (and presumably Rennell Island) was replaced by Christianity in 1938. The Copenhagen University funded research to examine the rituals of Bellona Island which indicated that many men recalled the story that the island began as a Nerita shell and rose up from the ocean (p24).\n\nIn present time the people of Rennell are geographically divided between the lower lake end and the higher end by two Christian denominations. Around the eastern end, Te Nggano, the people follow the South Seas Evangelical Church, with the Seventh-day Adventist Church occupying the western end. The Seventh-day Adventists worship on Saturday, and South Seas Evangelical Church (SSEC) worship on Sunday. Church Leaders play a small part in most communities, and the traditional chief/elder system is becoming defunct.\n\nPortions of the population do not actively attend church, especially young people, though most \"community leaders\", are nominated as teachers, elders, chiefs or pastors.\n\n\nThere are two medical clinics currently staffed on Rennell Island. They are located in the Tigoa and Tegano villages on Lake Tegano.\n\nThe standard of medical care available in the clinics is very basic. Most serious cases are referred to Central Hospital Honiara, for further consultation. Generally the patient is transported on the next scheduled air flight although in emergency cases, the RAMSI aircraft is used.\n\nMalaria is a serious health risk in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea but Renbel province is the only area where malaria is not a problem.\n\nBellona Island also has one medical clinic.\n\nThere are schools in all of the main villages and a Bible college which conducts courses on vehicle maintenance, cooking, construction and general living courses. It is estimated that the ratio of students is 80% boys and 20% girls with various reasons identified such as costs, tradition and family home duties.\n\nHenua Community High School is situated in Niupani village, next to the World Heritage site of East Rennell.\nNearby Hutuna village is the site of the eighth People First Network email station, which was established in 2003. Hutuna was one of the sites which was included in the 2004 JICA-USP research on the impacts of the ICT on rural development.\n\nEast Rennell\nWest Rennell\n\n'East Rennell'\n\n'West Rennell'\n\nThere is no phone, television or radio service. Short wave radio can pick up intermittent frequencies and satellite phones do operate. There are about five high frequency radio units in the province and operate on frequency 6815.\n\nTwo villages (Hutuna and Niupani) alongside the lake have communications via the novel People First Network initiative including a distance learning centre opened in June 2007 by an EU-funded Ministry of Education project\n\nThere is no telephone land line or mobile coverage. The pfNet project enables internet access at Lake Te’Nggano which is a 20-minute boat trip and 15 minute walk.\n\nThe Solomon Islands Telecommunication Company[] will establish a satellite service on this island to be located about 100metres from the airstrip. Services will include a payphone, mobile phone coverage and internet and may even include a repeater station for one of the FM radio stations. Initially the opening date was scheduled for July 2008 but delayed due shipping delays. As of September 2008 the 6 month late barge arrived and offloaded supplies where construction resumed.\n\nThere are about 20 serviceable generators on the island at time of report. These generators are mostly reliable; however use is restricted due to cost and difficulty in obtaining fuel. HF radios are powered by solar panel. No power grid is in existence. There are HF radios in each village and contact can be made through these in Rennell and Bellona.\n\nLimited fresh water is available at local springs if rain does not fill the water tanks. One washing water bore is in the general vicinity of Tingoa Police station.\n\nRennell Island has 8 informally run stores. In the limited times that supplies are available for sale they will be limited to tinned tuna, rice and a very small range of supplementary items. There are 3 similar stores at Bellona.\n\nOne packed-coral road runs down the centre of Rennell Island, but is in terrible repair, and \"high\" speed on the better sections should not exceed . there were about 19 operational motor vehicles (trucks & 4WDs), a red tractor and 8 motor cycles on the island and a few pushbikes.\n\nThe only public transport on the Island is the Blue Truck owned by the Minister for Transport. The price to stand on the back of the truck from Lavangu to Tingoa is $20 to $60 Solomon dollars per person, which can be negotiated. The truck is often used to transport the sick or injured to the Tingoa Clinic for treatment or assessment while maintaining regular passenger stops. The cost to charter this truck is $1,000 Sol.\n\nThe village of Lavangu on the central South coast has a channel passing through the reef to open water, and this is used by banana boats to transport cargo from ship to shore.\n\nLughughi Bay is located east of Tingoa. The port has a stone step that is used by landing craft to deposit heavy loads and vehicles onto the island. The road to Lughughi commences at the village of Tahanuka and is in a shocking state of repair, particularly the hill sections. The distance by road between Tahanuku & Lughughi is which is about a 50-minute drive. There are a couple of copra sheds at the port with little else. The step where cargo is offloaded is often filled in spots with local rocks to make it passable. This port is in very poor state and is not maintained.\n\nThe province has a ship/barge called ‘MV RENBEL’. The ship is multipurpose and currently transports passengers as well as cargo to Renbell on an irregular basis. The last ship to sail to Renbell was on 14 September 2008 and before that there was no service for 9 months. During the last few months the population survived mostly on coconuts and the occasional seafood with a total drought of the staple, rice.\n\nSea transport and vehicle transport are currently two of the main problems facing the Communities of Rennell and Bellona. The only other form of transport by sea is by fishing boats visiting the nearby reef. As a form of royalty to fish at the reef, these fishing boats transport goods and passengers.\n\nOne airfield is available on Rennell Island in Tigoa. It runs East to West at Tigoa. Bellona also has its own airstrip. Solomon Airlines [] provides a twice weekly service from Honiara – Bellona – Tigoa (Rennell Island) – Bellona – Honiara on Tuesdays and Fridays. A RAMSI flight arrives every Wednesday with either a staff changeover and/or supplies for the PPF.\n\nBoth islands have grass airstrips, but no other aviation infrastructure. The airstrip at Tigoa is maintained by Civil Aviation Division sub contractors and is mowed by manually slashing with brush knives. Often various communities volunteer to take on this role so they can utilize the money for events such as Christmas functions.\n\nGenerally flights leave Honiara at about 0700hrs and arrive in Rennell anywhere between 0800 and 0900hrs. Extra flights are scheduled sporadically. The flight agent resides at the Moreno Guesthouse, Tegiku (West Tigoa). On Bellona the Solair agents occupy a 2-storey building next to the aircraft \"terminal\".\n\nRSIP provide security during landings and takeoffs for all aircraft; this involves using the Hilux, an RSIP motorbike and police cordon tape to erect a simple barrier to keep onlookers at a safe distance. It is apparent that flight days are a weekly highlight for many locals.\n\nCorrespondence addressed to the police and government on 16 March 2008 details a lengthy land dispute regarding the airport.\nIn 1968 the Chief Priest and principal landowner of Tigoa land Mr Gilead Moa Tohahenua Gibauhenua Huaitebai allowed the construction of Tigoa airfield on his land.\n\nDuring the construction process, apparently 26 graves were dug up and 1,200 coconut trees were destroyed. The author claims that the Baimango tribe of Mugihenua own the Tigoa land and the dispute is with the Ngatonga tribe. Ngatonga tribe owned and lived at Tigoa up until the arrival of Christianity. When the elders of the Ngatonga tribe died and their siblings left for studies in Honiara and overseas, outsiders namely Baimango tribe tried to claim the land referring to history without proof\n\nTigoa (colored background) is the provincial capital of the province of Rennell and Bellona.\nWards 1 and 2 are East Rennel, and wards 3 through 6 West Rennel. Wards 7 through 10 of the province relate to Bellona Island.\n\n\n"}

It was developed by Australian company Home Entertainment Suppliers Pty. Ltd. (HES). Two models were released: the \"HES Unidaptor\" and the \"HES Unidaptor MKII\". Neither version is compatible with the original Japanese Famicom.\n\nNintendo, in an attempt to prevent companies releasing an unlicensed Nintendo game (which is not illegal to do), in later revisions of their hardware locked out these titles. To circumvent this, HES developed a bypass technology called the 'Piggy Back' or 'Dongle' game, where you could insert an officially licensed NES cartridge into the back of a HES game and it operated using the country code of the official title. This was so successful HES also used this technology to build a converter to bypass the 10NES security protocol entirely, released as the HES Unidaptor.\n\nOther companies have released similar products but none that allows the conversion of all NES games onto all NES hardware.\n\nThe original HES Unidaptor is quite a bulky device with a cartridge that slips into the NES unit, and straps over the top of the NES. The component that lies atop of the NES has three slots.\n\n\"Slot 1\" is the \"master\" slot which is where the user inserts an official licensed NES game compatible with the NES hardware so that the 10NES chip can read the country code from the master's EPROM.\nThe others, \"Slot 2\" and \"Slot 3\" (called the \"slaves\"), allowed the user to insert either a 72-pin NTSC/PAL cartridge to play or a 60-pin Famicom respectively.\n\nWhen the NES was switched on it read the security code from the local licensed title, and then executed the code on the slave's cartridge.\n\nBecause its connector to the NES was only made with a 72-pin configuration, this unit was only compatible with American, European, Australian and New Zealand NES machines. However it was still able to play 60-pin Japanese Famicom games on those systems.\n\nA more refined and cheaper version was released that was more similar in appearance to HES games. It was simply a cartridge that slotted into the NES, which had two 'Piggy back' slots (the bottom being the master and the top being the slave).\n\nThis unit only supported 72-pin NTSC/PAL cartridges.\n\n\n\n"}

Ronald Duncan based his English libretto on André Obey's play \"\".\n\nThe opera was first performed at Glyndebourne in England on 12 July 1946. It is the first work to which Britten applied his term \"chamber opera.\" The opera debuted in the United States on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre in a production staged by Agnes de Mille which opened on 29 December 1948 and closed on 15 January 1949 after 23 performances. The cast notably included Giorgio Tozzi as Tarquinius, Kitty Carlisle as Lucretia, Lidija Franklin as Bianca, Brenda Lewis as the Female Chorus, and Adelaide Bishop as Lucia.\n\nIn 1996 the opera was presented at the Opera Theatre of St. Louis directed by Britten expert and friend, Colin Graham. It also appeared in the Opera Company of Philadelphia's 2009 season. In 2013, the opera was performed for the first time by Glyndebourne since its premiere, directed by actress Fiona Shaw. This production opened on tour to great acclaim. Shaw's production premiered at Glyndebourne's festival in 2015 to similar acclaim.\n\nThe Male and Female Choruses explain the situation in Rome: ruled by the foreigner Tarquinius Superbus and fighting off a Greek invasion, the city has sunk into depravity. The two choruses describe their own role as Christian interpreters of the pagan story about to begin. Throughout the opera the Male Chorus will narrate the thoughts of the male characters, and the Female Chorus those of the female characters.\n\nIn an armed camp outside Rome, Tarquinius, Collatinus and Junius are drinking together. The previous night, a group of soldiers rode home unexpectedly to Rome to check on their wives, all of whom were caught betraying their husbands, with the single exception of Collatinus' wife Lucretia. Junius, whose wife was among the faithless majority, goads young Tarquinius, the king's son, into testing Lucretia's chastity himself. The impulsive prince calls for his horse and gallops off to the city alone.\n\nAt Collatinus' house in Rome, Lucretia is patiently spinning with her servants Bianca and Lucia. She longs for her absent husband. As the women prepare for bed, there is a knock at the door: Tarquinius. Though fearful, they cannot refuse to offer the prince hospitality.\n\nAs Lucretia sleeps, Tarquinius creeps into her bedroom and awakens her with a kiss. She begs him to go, but certain that she desires him, he rapes her.\n\nThe following morning, Lucia and Bianca are glad to discover that Tarquinius has already left the house. Lucretia enters, calm but obviously devastated. She sends a messenger asking Collatinus to come home. Bianca tries to stop the messenger, but Collatinus arrives at once (accompanied by Junius). He comforts his wife lovingly, but she feels that she will never be clean again. She stabs herself and dies. All mourn. Junius plans to use this crime by the prince to spark a rebellion against the king.\n\nThe Female Chorus is left in despair at the moral emptiness of this story. But the Male Chorus tells her that all pain is given meaning, and all sin redeemed, in the suffering of Christ. The two end the opera with a prayer.\n\n\n"}

It is a part of his compositional cycle called Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin. \n\nThe partita contains five movements, given in Italian as:\n\n\nExcept for the ciaccona, the movements are dance types of the time, and they are frequently listed by their French names: Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue, and Chaconne. The final movement is written in the form of variations, and lasts approximately as long as the first four movements combined.\n\nPerformance time of the whole partita varies between 26 and 32 minutes, depending on the approach and style of the performer.\n\nProfessor Helga Thoene suggests that this partita, and especially its last movement, was a tombeau written in memory of Bach's first wife, Maria Barbara Bach (who died in 1720), though this theory is controversial.\n\nYehudi Menuhin called the Chaconne \"the greatest structure for solo violin that exists\".\n\nViolinist Joshua Bell has said the Chaconne is \"not just one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, but one of the greatest achievements of any man in history. It's a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful, structurally perfect.\" He played the piece busking in L'Enfant Plaza for \"The Washington Post\".\n\nRaymond Erickson has identified approximately two hundred transcriptions and arrangements of Bach's Ciaccona.\n\nSince Bach's time, several transcriptions of the piece have been made for other instruments, particularly for the piano (including those by Ferruccio Busoni, Alexander Siloti, Joachim Raff, and Rudolf Lutz), and for the piano left-hand (by Johannes Brahms, Paul Wittgenstein, and Géza Zichy).\n\nJohannes Brahms, in a letter to Clara Schumann in June 1877, said about the ciaccona:\n\nFelix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann each wrote piano accompaniments for the work.\n\nCarl Reinecke transcribed the piece for piano duet.\n\nThe earliest version for organ is by William Thomas Best. Further transcriptions are by John Cook, Wilhelm Middelschulte, Walter Henry Goss-Custard (1915–55), and Henri Messerer (1838–1923).\n\nIn the preface to his 1955 transcription, John Cook writes: \"The Chaconne is sublimely satisfying in its original form, yet many will agree that a single violin is only able to hint at the vast implications of much of this music … It is perhaps not unreasonable to suppose that Bach would have chosen the organ, had he transcribed the Chaconne himself, as the instrument best suited to the scale of his ideas … A good performance on the violin may be taken as the best guide to interpretation on the organ — the two instruments are not without their points in common, and both were beloved of Bach.\"\n\nThere is a transcription of the Chaconne for solo cello made by cellist Johann Sebastian Paetsch in 2015. This has been published by the Hofmeister Musikverlag in Leipzig.\n\nThe Chaconne is often performed on guitar. Marc Pincherle, Secretary of the French Society of Musicology in Paris, wrote in 1930: \"If, insofar as certain rapid monodic passages are concerned, opinion is divided between the violin and the guitar as the better medium, the guitar always triumphs in polyphonic passages; that is to say almost throughout the entire work. The timbre of the guitar creates new and emotional resonance and unsuspected dynamic gradations in those passages which might have been created purely for the violin; as for instance the variations in arpeggi.\"\n\nThe most well-known transcription for guitar is the Segovia transcription. Many guitarists today prefer to play the Chaconne directly from the violin score.\n\nThere are a number of transcriptions of the Chaconne for orchestras of different sizes, including Leopold Stokowski's transcription for a full symphony orchestra.\n\nGustav Leonhardt arranged the Partita for harpsichord solo. Anne Dudley arranged Bach's Chaconne for piano trio, and a recording by the Eroica Trio appears on their \"Baroque\" album. The Chaconne has also been arranged for harpsichord by Pieter-Jan Belder and for violin plus four voices by Christoph Poppen and the Hilliard Ensemble.\n\nIn 2005 Joseph C. Mastroianni published \"Chaconne The Novel\". Milo, abandoned by the father who introduced him to Chaconne, studies in Spain for four years to master the piece.\n\nIn 2008 Arnold Steinhardt, the violin soloist and first violinist of the Guarneri String Quartet, published \"Violin Dreams\", a memoir about his life as a violinist and about his ultimate challenge: playing Bach's Chaconne.\n\nIn 2017 and published a book about Bach's Chaconne: \"Excerpts from Eternity – The Purification of Time and Character, the Fulfilment of Love and Cooperation with the Celestial Will in Johann Sebastian Bach's Ciaccona for Violin\".\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The song became a popular jazz standard, appearing on over 1300 albums performed by over 600 artists. One of them was Chet Baker , for whom it became his signature song. In 2015, it was announced that the Gerry Mulligan quartet featuring Chet Baker's version of the song was inducted into the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry for the song's \"cultural, artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation’s audio legacy\". Mulligan also recorded the song with his Concert Jazz Band in 1960.\n\nThe song is usually performed in C minor, although for vocalists the key of B minor is fairly common. Frank Sinatra recorded the song in B minor, and the theatrical version was also in B minor. Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song in G minor.\n\nThe song follows the following chord progression (in the key of C minor):\n\nThe second A section follows a similar progression, but the last two bars are replaced with a minor ii-V in Eb heading into the bridge.\n\nThe bridge is in the relative major and speeds up the harmonic progression to 2 chords per measure:\n\nThe last A section is extended by 4 bars:\n\nThis simple and classic structure makes it easy to adapt to other genres and for jazz musicians to improvise over the established chords.\n\n\"Babes in Arms\" opened at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway, in New York City on April 14, 1937 and ran for 289 performances. In the original play, a character named Billie Smith (played by Mitzi Green) sings the song to Valentine \"Val\" LaMar (played by Ray Heatherton). In the song, Billie pokes fun at some of Valentine's characteristics, but ultimately affirms that he makes her smile and that she doesn't want him to change (the song is often sung by a man to a woman, though to say that a woman's looks are \"laughable\" is anomalous).\n\nThe song first hit the charts in 1945, performed by Hal McIntyre with vocals by Ruth Gaylor. It only appeared for one week and hit No. 16.\n\nBing Crosby recorded the song in 1956 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set \"The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56)\" issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009.\n\nElvis Costello recorded a cover version in 1978. It came out in 1979 as the B-side of the single Oliver's Army and was later included in multiple compilation albums.\n\nMichael Buble recorded the song for his 2018 album Love.\n\n\n\n"}

They shared the argument that, because the proposition \"no-p is a not-p\" is not logically equivalent to \"It is thought that 'no-p is a not-p'\", psychologism does not logically stand. Psychologism was criticized in logic also by Charles Sanders Peirce whose fields included logic, philosophy, and experimental psychology, and generally in philosophy by Maurice Merleau-Ponty who held the chairs of philosophy and child psychology at the University of Paris.\n\nPsychologism is not widely held amongst logicians today, but it does have some high-profile defenders, for example Dov Gabbay.\n\n"}

BINOL has axial chirality and the two enantiomers can be readily separated and are stable toward racemisation. The specific rotation of the two enantiomers is ±35.5° (\"c\" = 1 in THF). BINOL is a precursor for another chiral ligand called BINAP. The volumetric mass density of the two enantiomers is 0.62 gcm.\n\nThe organic synthesis of BINOL is not a challenge as such but the preparation of the individual enantiomers is.\n\n(\"S\")-BINOL can be prepared directly from an asymmetric oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol with copper(II) chloride. The chiral ligand in this reaction is (\"S\")-(+)-amphetamine.\n\nRacemic BINOL can also be produced using iron(III) chloride as an oxidant. The mechanism involves complexation of iron(III) into the hydroxyl, followed by a radical coupling reaction of the naphthol rings initiated by iron(III) reducing into iron(II).\n\nOptically active BINOL can also be obtained from racemic BINOL by optical resolution. In one method, the alkaloid N-benzylcinchonidinium chloride forms a crystalline inclusion compound. The inclusion compound of the (\"S\")-enantiomer is soluble in acetonitrile but that of the (\"R\")-enantiomer is not. In another method BINOL is esterified with pentanoyl chloride. The enzyme cholesterol esterase hydrolyses the (\"S\")-diester but not the (\"R\")-diester. The (\"R\")-dipentanoate is hydrolysed in a second step with sodium methoxide. The third method employs HPLC with chiral stationary phases.\n\nAside from the starting materials derived directly from the chiral pool, (\"R\")- and (\"S\")-BINOL in high enantiopurity (>99% \"ee\") are two of the most inexpensive sources of chirality for organic synthesis, costing less than $0.6/g when purchased in bulk from chemical suppliers. As a consequence, it serves as an important starting material for other sources of chirality for stereoselective synthesis, both stoichiometric and substoichiometric (catalytic).\n\nMany important chiral ligands are constructed from the binaphthyl scaffold and ultimately derived from BINOL as a starting material, BINAP being one of the most well known and important.\n\nThe compound aluminium lithium bis(binaphthoxide) (ALB) is prepared by reaction of BINOL with lithium aluminium hydride. In a different stoichiometric ratio (1:1 BINOL/LiAlH instead of 2:1), the chiral reducing agent BINAL (lithium dihydrido(binaphthoxy)aluminate) is produced.\n\nIt has been employed in an asymmetric Michael reaction with cyclohexenone and dimethyl malonate:\n\nShibasaki catalysts\n"}

J. Abrams (in his directorial debut), co-written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and co-produced by and starring Tom Cruise in the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt. It is the third installment in the , following 2000's \"\". In the film, Ethan (Cruise) has retired from field work for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and trains new recruits. However, he is sent back into action to track down the elusive arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman).\n\n\"Mission: Impossible III\" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States on May 5, 2006. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it an improvement over its predecessors, and was a commercial success, grossing over $397 million against a $150 million budget. It was followed by \"\" in 2011.\n\nSix years after the events of the , Ethan Hunt has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell.\n\nThe team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp.\n\nIMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object codenamed the \"Rabbit's Foot\". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.\n\nOn the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbit's Foot, but Davian refuses to reveal anything. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is seemingly working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is attacked by German-speaking mercenaries deploying a UAV drone who have been hired to locate and extract Davian from IMF custody, and Davian escapes. Realizing Julia is also in danger, Ethan races to Julia's workplace, only to discover she has already been kidnapped. Davian calls Ethan and gives him 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life. But before Ethan can do anything, he is captured by the IMF.\n\nMusgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation but discreetly mouths that the Rabbit's Foot is located in Shanghai, China, and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan successfully escapes IMF headquarters shortly thereafter, resulting in him being declared an enemy of the state and placed on Interpol's most wanted list.\n\nEthan then secretly travels to Shanghai where Declan, Zhen, and Luther, sent by Musgrave under the guise of another operation, assist him in acquiring the Rabbit's Foot. As he delivers the Rabbit's Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. The restrained Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint, gagged to a chair. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves. Musgrave arrives, and reveals himself as the IMF traitor; he explains that Julia is still alive, and the woman killed was not Julia, but Davian's head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit's Foot. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot and sell it to a terrorist group so that IMF would have reason to launch a preemptive strike.\n\nWhen Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan manages to knock him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave's phone to track the last call's location to find Julia. With help from Benji on the phone, he locates the place, but encounters Davian and some of his henchmen. Ethan kills the henchmen, but Davian triggers the explosive in Ethan's head. Ethan fights him and manages to kill him. He comes back to free Julia, and then jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Julia fights off and kills a henchman, then Musgrave, who is carrying the Rabbit's Foot. She successfully resuscitates Ethan, who explains his true IMF career to her.\n\nBack in the US, Brassel and others congratulate Ethan as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.\n\nIn 2002, director David Fincher was slated to direct the next installment of the \"Mission: Impossible\" film series for a summer of 2004 release date. Fincher, however, dropped out in favor of another film, later citing creative differences over the direction of the series. Replacing Fincher was director Joe Carnahan, who worked on developing the film for 15 months. Under his involvement, the film was to feature \"Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who's based on Timothy McVeigh,\" as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles. Thandie Newton was offered to reprise her role as Nyah Nordoff-Hall from \"\" but she declined, in order to concentrate on her family. Her role in the story was later changed to a new character named Leah Quint, who would have been played by Moss. However, once J.J. Abrams took over directing the project, the character was scrapped.\n\nAfter a dispute over the film's tone, Carnahan quit in July 2004. Tom Cruise then called J. J. Abrams, offering the directorial role for the film after having binge-watched the first two seasons of \"Alias\". Abrams ultimately signed on, with production delayed a year due to his contractual obligations with \"Alias\" and \"Lost\". During this time, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project because of the many delays in production. On June 8, 2005, Paramount Pictures gave the film the green-light after a new cast of actors was hired and the film's budget was redeveloped, with Cruise taking a major pay cut.\n\nPrincipal photography began in Rome, Italy on July 12, 2005 and ended in October. Location filming took place in China (Shanghai and Xitang), Germany (Berlin), Italy (Rome and Caserta), the United States (California, Virginia and Maryland), and Vatican City. The night scenes involving the skyscrapers were filmed in Shanghai, while some of the Shanghai filming was also done in Los Angeles.\n\nThe film's musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino. He is the third composer to take on the series, following Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. The score album was released on May 9, 2006 by Varèse Sarabande Records. Unlike the previous installments, no soundtrack album featuring the film's contemporary music was released. Despite this, the film features a song by Kanye West entitled \"Impossible\" that also features Twista, Keyshia Cole and BJ.\n\nTo promote the film, Paramount rigged 4,500 randomly selected \"Los Angeles Times\" vending boxes with digital audio players which would play the theme song when the door was opened. The audio players did not always stay concealed, and in many cases came loose and fell on top of the stack of newspapers in plain view, with the result that they were widely mistaken for bombs. Police bomb squads detonated a number of the vending boxes and even temporarily shut down a veterans hospital in response to the apparent \"threat\". Despite these problems, Paramount and the \"Los Angeles Times\" opted to leave the audio players in the boxes until two days after the movie's opening.\n\nA blog entry of Hollywoodinterrupted.com in March 2006 alleged that Viacom (parent of Paramount and Comedy Central) canceled the rebroadcast of the \"South Park\" episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" due to threats by Cruise to refuse to participate in the \"Mission: Impossible III\" publicity circle. These assertions were soon also reported by E! News and \"American Morning\".\n\nFox News attributed threats from Cruise, stating, \"to back out of his \"Mission: Impossible III\" promotional duties if Viacom didn't pull a repeat of the episode\", as evidence of \"bad blood\" between Cruise and Viacom. \"The Washington Post\" reported that \"South Park\" fans \"struck back\", in March 2006, and threatened to boycott \"Mission: Impossible III\" until Comedy Central put \"Trapped in the Closet\" back on its schedule. Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the film's box office debut. Political blogger Andrew Sullivan encouraged a boycott of the film, based on claims that Cruise allegedly forced Comedy Central to censor a \"South Park\" episode about Scientologists. \"Make sure you don't go see Paramount's \"Mission: Impossible III\", Cruise's upcoming movie,\" Sullivan wrote. \"I know you weren't going to see it anyway. But now any money you spend on this movie is a blow against freedom of speech. Boycott it. Tell your friends to boycott it.\"\n\nWhen asked in ABC's \"Primetime\" about his involvement with stopping the episode rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated \"First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'\"\n\nOpening in 4,054 theaters all across the United States, the fourth largest opening ever up to that point, the film topped the box office in its opening weekend. It made $16.6 million on its opening day and $47.7 million in its opening weekend, a solid opening yet almost $10 million lower than the franchise's previous films. The film remained at number one with $25 million during its second weekend, ahead of \"Poseidon\" gross of $22.2 million. The film remained in the Top 10 at the box office for the remainder of its first six weeks. It ended its initial domestic run on July 20, 2006, taking in a total of $134 million. It was the second movie in 2006 to pass the $100,000,000 mark in the box office, following \"\". The $134 million domestic run was significantly lower than that of \"Mission: Impossible 2\".\n\nOutside the US, the film grossed $70 million during its first five days (in some Asian countries, it opened two days ahead of its North American release date) and was easily the box-office champion in many countries. As of 2017, its international box office gross has reached $263.8 million for a combined worldwide gross of $397.8 million, the lowest so far of the series and the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2006.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the film debuted at 1 in the week of May 4–10, grossing a total of € 532,384. The following week, the film remained on the top position. In its third, the film dropped to 2 and fell to 4 to the following week. Next, it maintained the 4 position to drop to 6 (in the week of June 6 - June 14). In total, the film has grossed over €2,141,162. Mission Impossible III took less than half at the box office than Fallout and to date Mission Impossible III is the lowest-grossing film in the series.\n\nOn the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Mission: Impossible III\" received 71% positive reviews from critics, with an average of 6.6/10, based on 224 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fast-paced, with eye-popping stunts and special effects, the latest \"Mission: Impossible\" installment delivers everything an action fan could ask for. A thrilling summer popcorn flick.\" It holds a similar rating on Metacritic, with an average score of 66/100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a normalized average of 42 reviews.\n\nOn the television show \"Ebert & Roeper\", Richard Roeper gave \"Mission: Impossible III\" a \"thumbs up,\" while Roger Ebert gave it a marginal \"thumbs down.\" In Ebert's print review, he gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying, \"Either you want to see mindless action and computer-generated sequences executed with breakneck speed and technical precision, or you do not. I am getting to the point where I don't much care.\" He felt \"surprised that the plot hangs together more than in the other two films.\"\n\nKeith Phipps of \"The Onion\" \"A.V. Club\" said the film is \"business as usual, but it's the best kind of business as usual, and it finds everyone working in top form.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"Mission: Impossible III\" \"a gratifyingly clever, booby-trapped thriller that has enough fun and imagination and dash to more than justify its existence.\" Marc Savlov of \"The Austin Chronicle\" said that \"it's all poppycock, of course, but it's done with such vim and vigor and both narrative and visual flair that you care not a jot.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying that it \"provides lots of action, but too little excitement.\"\n\nIan Nathan of \"Empire\" said that \"Mission: Impossible III\" has \"an inspired middle-hour pumped by some solid action\" but added that \"we now live in a post-Bourne, recalibrated-Bond universe, where Ethan Hunt looks a bit lost.\" Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said that \"Hoffman enlivens \"Mission: Impossible III\"\" but criticized the film's \"maudlin romance\" and \"Abrams's inability to adapt his small-screen talent to a larger canvas.\" Rob Nelson of the \"Dallas Observer\" said that \"Abrams's movie is too oppressive, too enamored of its brutality to deliver anything like real thrills; its deeply unpleasant tone nearly makes you long even for [\"Mission: Impossible 2\" director John] Woo's cartoon absurdities.\"\n\nClaudia Puig of \"USA Today\" said that \"\"Mission: Impossible III\" delivers\" despite \"a sense that the franchise is played out and its star over-exposed.\" Maitland McDonagh of \"TV Guide\" described the film as \"breezy, undemanding, and a carefully balanced blend of the familiar and the not-quite-what-you-expected.\" Lawrence Toppman of \"The Charlotte Observer\" said that \"Mission: Impossible III\" is \"plenty of fun\" despite being \"overwrought and overplotted.\"\n\nPete Vonder Haar of Film Threat said that \"you may be mildly entertained, but damned if you'll remember any of it five minutes later.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com said that \"Cruise is the single bright, blinking emblem of the failure of \"Mission: Impossible III\".\" William Arnold of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" remarked that \"the latest [\"Mission: Impossible\" film] is just this side of insultingly stupid.\" Shawn Levy of \"The Oregonian\" said that \"Mission: Impossible III\" \"feels like one of the more forgettable James Bond films—saddled, moreover, with a star who's sliding into self-parody.\"\n\n\"Mission: Impossible III\" was released on DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray on October 30, 2006, the first film by a studio to be released simultaneously in all three formats. A 4K UHD Blu-ray release occurred on June 26, 2018.\n\n"}

It is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, thrips, whiteflies, aphids and different beetles. Its use in the control of bedbugs<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jip.2012.04.009\"></ref> and malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.\n\nThe species is named after the Italian entomologist Agostino Bassi, who discovered it in 1815 as the cause of the muscardine disease which then led to carriers transmitting it by airborne means. It was formerly also known as \"Tritirachium shiotae\". The name \"B. bassiana\" has long been used to describe a species complex of morphologically similar and closely related isolates. Rehner and Buckley have shown that \"B. bassiana\" consists of many distinct lineages that should be recognized as distinct phylogenetic species and the genus \"Beauveria\" was redescribed with a proposed type for \"B. bassiana\" in 2011. In light of this work and the known existence of cryptic species, it is important to characterise isolates used to develop biological insecticides.\n\n\"Beauveria bassiana\" is the anamorph (asexually reproducing form) of \"Cordyceps bassiana\". The latter teleomorph (the sexually reproducing form) has been collected only in eastern Asia.\n\nThe insect disease caused by the fungus is a muscardine which has been called white muscardine disease. When the microscopic spores of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate, penetrate the cuticle, and grow inside, killing the insect within a matter of days. Afterwards, a white mold emerges from the cadaver and produces new spores. A typical isolate of \"B. bassiana\" can attack a broad range of insects; various isolates differ in their host range. The factors responsible for host susceptibility are not known.\n\n\"Beauveria bassiana\" parasitizing the Colorado potato beetle has been reported to be, in turn, the host of a mycoparasitic fungus \"Syspastospora parasitica\". This organism also attacks related insect-pathogenic species of the Clavicipitaceae.\n\nIn culture, \"B. bassiana\" grows as a white mould. On most common cultural media, it produces many dry, powdery conidia in distinctive white spore balls. Each spore ball is composed of a cluster of conidiogenous cells. The conidiogenous cells of \"B. bassiana\" are short and ovoid, and terminate in a narrow apical extension called a rachis. The rachis elongates after each conidium is produced, resulting in a long zig-zag extension. The conidia are single-celled, haploid, and hydrophobic.\n\n\"Beauveria bassiana\" can be used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, whiteflies, and many other insects. Its use in the control of malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation. As an insecticide, the spores are sprayed on affected crops as an emulsified suspension or wettable powder or applied to mosquito nets as a mosquito control agent.\n\nAs a species, \"Beauveria bassiana\" parasitizes a very wide range of arthropod hosts. However, different strains vary in their host ranges, some having rather narrow ranges, like strain Bba 5653 that is very virulent to the larvae of the diamondback moth and kills only few other types of caterpillars. Some strains do have a wide host range and should, therefore, be considered nonselective biological insecticides. These should not be applied to flowers visited by pollinating insects.\n\nKnown targets include:\n\n\nThe fungus rarely infects humans or other animals, so it is generally considered safe as an insecticide. However, at least one case of human infection by \"B. bassiana\" has been reported in a person with a suppressed immune system. Additionally, the spores may exacerbate breathing difficulties. Wagner and Lewis reported the ability of \"B. bassiana\" to grow as an endophyte in corn.\n\nA fungus attributed to be \"B. bassiana\" was observed to cause infections in a captive American alligator and \"B. bassiana\" was implicated in causing a pulmonary disease in captive tortoises. The reptiles were in captivity and under temperature stress which may explain their susceptibility to the fungus. When a tortoise was kept at 22°C and injected with 0.5 mL of 106 spores of \"B. bassiana\" into the lung, no mortality was observed, while a second contaminated tortoise died when kept only at 16°C.\n\nPreliminary research has shown the fungus is 100% effective in eliminating bed bugs exposed to cotton fabric sprayed with fungus spores. It is also effective against bed bug colonies due to \"B. bassiana\" carried by infected bugs back to their harborages. All subjects died within 5 days of exposure.\n\nIn March 2013, genetically modified \"Beauveria bassiana\" was found in a number of research laboratories and greenhouses outside of a designated containment area at Lincoln University in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Ministry for Primary Industries investigated the leak.\n\n\n"}

The cult was centered in Thebes in Upper Egypt during the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth dynasties (circa 740–525 BC). The office had political importance as well as religious, since the two were closely related in ancient Egypt.\n\nAlthough the title is first attested in the Middle Kingdom, its full political potential was not realized until the advent of the Eighteenth Dynasty.\n\nThe shorter version of the title \"God's Wife\" is in use by the time of the Twelfth Dynasty, when the title is attested for the non-royal women Iy-meret-nebes and Neferu. As early as the First Intermediate Period, there is mention of A \"Wife of the God\" in reference to the god Min. The full title of God's Wife of Amun is only used during and after the Eighteenth Dynasty.\n\nAt the beginning of the New Kingdom, the God's Wife of Amun royal title started to be held by royal women (usually the wife of the king, but sometimes by the mother of the king), when its extreme power and prestige was first evident. The New Kingdom began in 1550 BC with the Eighteenth Dynasty. These were the rulers who drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and their native city was Thebes, which then became the leading city in Egypt. They believed that their local deity, Amun, had guided them in their victory and the cult rose to national importance. Adjustments to the rituals and myths followed.\n\nThe title, \"God's Wife of Amun\", \"referred to the myth of the divine birth of the king, according to which his mother was impregnated by the god Amun.\" While the office theoretically, was sacred, it was essentially wielded as a political tool by the serving Egyptian pharaoh to ensure \"royal authority over the Theban region and the powerful priesthood of Amun\" there. The royal lineage was traced through its women and, the rulers and the religious institutions were inexorably woven together in traditions that remained quite stable over a period of three thousand years. This title was used in preference to the title, \"Great Royal Wife\", which was the title of the queen who was the consort to the pharaoh and who officiated at the temple. The new title conveyed that the pharaoh would be a demigod upon birth. Previously the pharaoh was considered to become divine only at death. \n\nThe first royal wife to hold this new title (not to be mistaken with the title of God's Wife) was Queen Ahmose-Nefertari, the wife of Ahmose I, and this event is recorded in a stele in the temple of Amun at Karnak, and the role was a priestly post of importance in the temple of Amun in Thebes. She then passed it on to her daughter Ahmose-Meritamun, who in turn handed it to Hatshepsut, who used it before she ascended the throne as pharaoh. \n\nBoth Ahmose-Nefertari and Hatshepsut sometimes used the title as an alternative to that of \"\"King's Principal Wife\"\", which shows how important they felt the role was. Hatshepsut passed the title on to her daughter Neferure. \n\nA series of scenes in Hatshepsut's Chapelle Rouge show the \"God's Wife of Amun\" (her daughter) and a male priest undergoing a ritual or ceremony that seems to be aimed at destroying the names of enemies. Other scenes elsewhere show the \"God's Wife of Amun\" worshiping the deities, being purified in the sacred lake, and following the king into the sanctuary. These again show the importance of the role, but give very little indication of the tasks and responsibilities involved.\n\nHatshepsut was the daughter of Thutmose I and, upon his death, she became the wife of the youthful Thutmose II who was her young half-brother, born to a lesser wife than her mother. She seems to have been a de facto co-regent with him, having a great deal of influence upon the affairs of state. They had only one child who survived childhood, a daughter, Neferure, to whom the title of \"God's Wife of Amun\" was passed. \n\nUpon the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut was appointed regent for the very youthful Thutmose III, who was not born to her—the royal wife and queen of his father—rather, he was born of a lesser wife. He was her stepson and nephew. Shortly thereafter, Hatshepsut was named pharaoh. \n\nHer daughter, Neferure, took her place in many functions that required a royal queen serving as the \"Great Royal Wife\" and, as \"God's Wife of Amun\" in the temple, while Thutmose III remained as co-regent to Hatshepsut. He became the head of the armies.\n\nHatshepsut died after a 22-year reign and, Thutmose III became pharaoh. At the end of a thirty-year reign of his own, he entered into a co-regency with a son by a lesser wife who would become, Amenhotep II. Neferure had died without leaving another heir, but there were others in line to become pharaoh, so the co-regency assured that these royal offspring with closer ties to Hatshepsut would be removed from the line of descent, and Thutmose III's chosen heir would rule. \nThe records of holders of the title, \"God's Wife of Amun\", after Thutmose III became pharaoh deviate from the established pattern, perhaps because of the line of royalty issue. After Neferure the list notes, Iset, the mother of Thutmose III, but it is quite certain that she never officiated, and was awarded the title after her death. Next is, Satiah, a lesser wife of Thutmose III in the early part of his reign. She is followed by, Merytre-Hatshepsut, another lesser wife of Thutmose III, who became the mother of his ultimate heir. She was the daughter of the \"Divine Adoratrice of Amun\", Huy. Next on the list is, Meritamen, a daughter of Thutmose III and Merytre-Hatshepsut, thereby the sister of his ultimate heir. After all of those changes during his long reign, the office holder was the daughter of Thutmose III, returning to the traditional association. \n\nAmenhotep II seems to be the one who initiated the attempts to remove records of Hatshepsut's reign while his father was an old man and continued these efforts after he became pharaoh in his own right, claiming many of her achievements as his own, but failing to be thorough. \n\nAmenhotep II also tried to break traditions by preventing the names of his wives from being recorded and introducing women who were not from the royal lineage into the line of descent—\"without success\"—as his designated heir was overlooked. After his death, which is estimated as 1400 BC, Thutmose IV was selected from the royal lineage as the next pharaoh.\n\nThe power and prestige of the role of the \"God's Wife of Amun\" was greatly diminished by Amenhotep II. He may have declined to have one, unless it remained as his sister, Meritamen. The woman listed as holding the office next is Tiaa. That is the name of a wife of his who was the mother of Thutmose IV and it is possible that she was named to this title by her son since he gave her other titles, however, the daughter of Thutmose IV also was named Tiaa. \n\nLater in that dynasty, with religious changes affecting the status of the cult, the title then fell out of favour. The pharaoh Amenhotep IV, ruling from 1353 or 1351, initially followed the religious traditions. Soon he instituted a new religion that elevated Aten, not only to become the dominant cult, but as a monotheistic cult, suppressing the worship of others. The pharaoh changed his name to Akhenaten and moved his court to a new capital he had built, Akhetaten \"Horizon of Aten\", at the site known today as Amarna. He and his royal wife, Nefertiti (whom he treated as a co-regent) became the intermediaries between Aten and the people. The worship of Amun was especially targeted for suppression and many of his temples were defaced and no idols were permitted. Aten became \"The Aten\", represented only as a solar disk. Religious rituals were performed in open air settings. \n\nThe death of Akhenaten occurred circa 1336 BC and it was not long before the traditional religious practices began to resume. It is possible that Nefertiti ruled under another name and, perhaps, was an influence in the royal family until near the end of the rule of Tutankhamun (1333–1324 BC), but if she did, she did not prevent the revival.\nTutankhamun began ruling as a child of nine under the name of Tutankhaten. Some think that he was the son of Akhenaten by a minor wife. During his reign his name was changed away from the deity of his father, replacing \"aten\" with \"amun\". This marks the beginning of a transition back to Thebes as the capital as well. \n\nThe last ruler of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Horemheb (1320–1292 BC), restored the priesthood of Amun, but he prevented the Amun priesthood from resuming the powerful position they had held before Akhenaten dissolved the powerful cult and moved the capital away from their city. Horemheb had reformed the army and had developed a loyal chain of command within it. By appointing priests to the cult of Amun from the high ranks of his trusted army, he avoided any attempts to reestablish the powerful relationships that had provoked the drastic change made by Akhenaten.\n\nThe title, \"God's Wife of Amun\", was revived during the Twentieth Dynasty, when Ramesses VI (1145–1137 BC) conferred this office as well as the additional title of \"Divine Adoratrice of Amun\" on his daughter, Iset; the king's actions inaugurated the tradition where every subsequent holder of this office had to be \"a king's daughter, and was expected to remain an unmarried virgin. In order to assist [in] the royal succession, she would adopt the daughter of the next king as her heiress.\"\n\nThe office of the \"God's Wife of Amun\" reached the very heights of its political power during the late Third Intermediate Period, when Shepenupet I, Osorkon III's daughter, was first appointed to this post at Thebes. The Nubian king Kashta, in turn, appointed his daughter, Amenirdis, as her successor. The high status of this office is illustrated by the tomb of Amenirdis at Medinet Habu.\n\nLater, during the Saite Twenty-sixth Dynasty, Psamtik I would forcibly reunite Egypt in March 656 BC under his rule and compel the \"God's Wife of Amun\" serving at the time, Shepenupet II, daughter of Piye, to adopt \"his\" daughter Nitocris as her chosen successor to this position.\n\nThe office continued in existence until 525 BC under Nitocris' successor, Ankhnesneferibre, when the Persian Empire overthrew Egypt's last Saite ruler, Psamtik III (526–525 BC), and enslaved his daughter. Thereafter, the powerful office of \"God's Wife of Amun\" disappears from history.\n\n\"Holders of the office from the tenth through the twelfth dynasties are not noted on this list because they were not women from the royal line\".\n\n(hiatus – when the title was not used, due to political and religious changes that occurred and reverted again)\n\n\n\n"}

He has released around a dozen albums, mostly on his own Shockorama label. \"Lonelyland\" (2001) was licensed through Universal Records, while in 2005 distribution deal with Vanguard Records saw his albums made widely available. In 2009 he signed to Kirtland Records and put out \"Lovely Creatures\", \"A Perfect Day\", and \"Burden of Proof\". His record \"The King Kong Suite\" was released on Shockorama Records in 2015.\n\nSchneider was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan to Bob Sr. and Katie Schneider (a teacher) and raised in El Paso and Munich, Germany together with his sister. The son of an opera singer, he moved with his parents to Germany when he was two, while his father received instruction from noted vocal teachers. It led to a marginal existence as “my parents had this big plan, but my dad just didn’t have the voice\". He learned guitar and piano at an early age, and performed at his parents' parties.\n\nBefore performing solo, he performed for years in various bands. He dropped out of the University of Texas at El Paso where he studied art, while performing in his first band, a funk-rock outfit called Joe Rockhead. The band independently released three albums before disbanding. Schneider subsequently performed with Ugly Americans who were an opening act for the Dave Matthews Band and signed with the revived Capricorn Records. In 1997, Schneider co-founded The Scabs, a funk ensemble that regularly played in around Austin and described as \" inspired by The Rugburns (right down to the suits and ties) [with] bawdy show tunes and puerile blues in the beginning, but eventually the powerhouse funk took over when the Grooveline Horns were added\".\n\nIn 1999, Schneider formed a solo act, initially under the name Lonelyland, which became the title of his record released through Universal Records. His style has been described as \"acoustic based songs with electronic beats and noises in the background (..) and other types of cross genre music. His live shows are known for improvisation [and] audience involvement\".\n\nHe went on to record the major-label solo albums \"Lonelyland\" (2001) and \"I'm Good Now\" (2004), which garnered him significantly more national attention and some critical acclaim. \"Big Blue Sea\" from the \"Lonelyland\" album received significant radio play, as did \"Come With Me Tonight\" from \"I'm Good Now\". \"Metal & Steel\" from \"Lonelyland\" is, to date, Schneider's most played song.\n\nThe contracts that he signed with Universal in 2001 and Vanguard in 2004 allowed him to release albums as \"side projects\" on his own Shockorama Records. Among the albums that have been self-released are \"Galaxy Kings\" and \"I've Seen The End of the World and It Looks Like This.\" All of these side projects were re-released by Vanguard in conjunction with the release of his 2006 album \"The Californian\". Previously, these albums had limited availability as approximately 10,000 copies were produced. After releasing \"The Californian\", Schneider also put out \"Greatest Hits Live\", recorded in Austin on July 17, 2006, on Shockorama Records. He has a long-standing Monday night residency at the Saxon Pub and regularly plays at Antone's, both venues in Austin. His live-band includes Harmoni Kelley (bass), Jeff Plankenhorn (guitars), Conrad Choucroun (drums), Danny Levin (cello) and Oliver Steck (accordion).\n\nIn 2009, Schneider signed with Kirtland Records and released \"Lovely Creatures\" in September 2009. It featured the single \"40 Dogs (Like Romeo and Juliet)\", which peaked at #14 on the AAA Radio Chart. The album also featured Patty Griffin on the track \"Changing Your Mind\". He released a second album on the label entitled \"A Perfect Day\" on April 19, 2011, featuring the single \"Let The Light In.\" \"Burden of Proof\" was released on June 11, 2013. \n\nHis next musical project, \"King Kong\", was released in 2015 under the Shockorama label and was the result of a crowdsourcing campaign through PledgeMusic. \"King Kong\" saw its release over the course of 2015 in the form of three EPs (volumes collectively known as \"The King Kong Suite\") as well as a full length album made available to his online backers. In 2017, Schneider began making his massive backlog of recorded demos available to his fans through Patreon. His next album \"Blood and Bones\" was released on June 8, 2018.\n\n\nBob Schneider has won 55 Austin Music Awards, to date, for multiple different projects ranging from 1992 to 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost every one of Schneider's live show are recorded by his sound engineer Jay Thomas and made available for purchase. Originally available only as a double-disc set sold after each performance, Bob began to make and continues to make these recordings (dubbed \"Frunk\") available for purchase through his website in early 2009. The double-disc sets were gradually phased out throughout 2010/2011.\n\n\n"}

Shamsuddeen's succession to the throne was in part favoured by the fact that he was great-nephew to Muhammad Didi Ranna Baderi Kilegefanu, the prime minister to three successive Sultans, who strongly protested to the Ceylon Governor in Colombo on behalf of his discarded great-nephew.\n\nFrom Malé, Shamsuddeen wrote to his great-uncle, to return and resume the post of prime minister. At this time Haajee Imaaduddeen, nephew of the late sultan Nooraddeen, who would take over the throne after 2 months, ran the country. Ibrahim Didi and some other members of the Council of Ministers ('little knowing what evil a decade was to bring forth') encouraged Haajee Imaaduddeen to seize the throne from the young sultan as they despised Muhammad Didi's complete control over his grandnephew Sultan Shamsuddeen. However the enthronement was based on the specious plea stating a unanimous dissatisfaction by the people regarding the existing sultanate with a 'mere lad as Sultan, not able to do or undo anything himself'. By this decree Haajee Imaaduddeen was raised to the throne and named Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI, with Ibrahim Didi as his prime minister.\n\nShamsuddeen came back to power again in 1902 after the peaceful Malé Revolution which took place while Sultan Muhammad Imaaduddeen VI temporarily quit his kingdom with the object of marrying the high-born Egyptian Sharifa Hanim, the daughter of Abd-ur Rakhman Khami Bhey, the Consul of Persia. Muhammad Shamsuddeen III's full coronation ceremony (\"the Ceremony of the Assumption of the State Sword of the Kingdom of the Maldive Islands\") was not held until 27 July 1905. The ceremony was attended by Sir John Keene on behalf of Edward VII, the Katheeb of Kelaa of Thiladhummathi Atoll on behalf of the inhabitants of the northern atolls of the kingdom and the Katheeb of Isdhū of Haddhunmathi Atoll on behalf of the inhabitants of the southern atolls of the kingdom.\n\nHe was arrested on 2 October 1934 and was banished to Fuvahmulah with crown prince Henveyru Ganduvaru Manippulhu. The crown prince died there but later the Sultan was brought to Malé Atoll Villigili. The sultan died in Malé at the residence of Moonimaa'ge.\n\nHe is credited with bringing the first Constitution of Maldives on 22 December 1932.\n"}

Bathymetry is the underwater equivalent.\n\nOn Earth, the elevations can take on either positive or negative (below sea level) values, and are bimodal due to the contrast between the continents and oceans. On other planets within this solar system, elevations are typically unimodal, owing to the lack of oceans on those bodies.\n\nA hypsometric curve is a histogram or cumulative distribution function of elevations in a geographical area. Differences in hypsometric curves between landscapes arise because the geomorphic processes that shape the landscape may be different.\n\nWhen drawn as a 2-dimensional histogram, a hypsometric curve displays the elevation (\"y\") on the vertical, y-axis and area above the corresponding elevation (\"x\") on the horizontal or x-axis. The curve can also be shown in non-dimensional or standardized form by scaling elevation and area by the maximum values. The non-dimensional hypsometric curve provides a hydrologist or a geomorphologist with a way to assess the similarity of watersheds — and is one of several characteristics used for doing so. The hypsometric integral is a summary measure of the shape of the hypsometric curve.\n\nIn the original paper on this topic, Arthur Strahler proposed a curve containing three parameters to fit different hypsometric relations:\n\nwhere \"a\", \"d\" and \"z\" are fitting parameters. Subsequent research using two-dimensional landscape evolution models has called the general applicability of this fit into question, as well as the capability of the hypsometric curve to deal with scale-dependent effects.\n\n\n"}

Usually oxidative couplings are catalysed by a transition metal complex like in classical cross-coupling reactions, although the underlying mechanism is different due to the oxidation process that requires an external (or internal) oxidant. Many such couplings utilize dioxygen as the stoichiometric oxidant but proceed by electron transfer. \n\nMany oxidative couplings generate new C-C bonds. Early examples involve coupling of terminal alkynes:\n\nCoupling reactions involving methane are highly sought, related to C1 chemistry because C derivatives are far more valuable than methane. The oxidative coupling of methane gives ethylene:\n\nIn oxidative aromatic coupling the reactants are electron-rich aromatic compounds. Typical substrates are phenols and typical catalysts are copper and iron compounds and enzymes. The first reported synthetic application dates back to 1868 with Julius Löwe and the synthesis of ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide. Another reaction is the synthesis of 1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol from 2-naphthol by iron chloride, discovered in 1873 by Alexander Dianin (\"S\")-BINOL can be prepared directly from an asymmetric oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol with copper(II) chloride.\n\nThe oxygen evolution reaction entails, in effect, the oxidative coupling of water molecules to give O.\n"}

His assassination was the first of many killings of journalists in Russia.\n\nKholodov was born in Zagorsk (now Sergiyev Posad) on 21 June 1967. He studied physics.\n\nKholodov began his working life alongside his parents at the defence industry institute in Klimovsk in the Moscow Region. Faced by limited career prospects he turned to journalism, first working for the local radio. In 1992, he became a reporter with the national \"Moskovsky Komsomolets\" daily newspaper.\n\nIn 1993, Kholodov travelled to hotspots around the former Soviet Union, reporting for \"Moskovsky Komsomolets\". In particular, he was in Abkhazia during the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict and, as he witnessed the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia, sent many detailed reports, including one entitled \"Sukhumi apocalypse\".\n\nIn October 1993 Kholodov interviewed Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. For the next twelve months, on the basis of leaks from army and Ministry of Defence sources, he wrote and published numerous articles about high-level corruption in the military, especially concerning the misuse of funds intended to ease the withdrawal and resettlement of half a million former Soviet troops and their families who had been based in East Germany. Kholodov was due to speak at Duma hearings into these allegations, which supposedly reached as high as the Defence Minister himself, when he was murdered. None of the allegations were ever tested in court. Grachev was replaced as Defence Minister in 1996 after the end of the First Chechen War.\n\nKholodov died on 17 October 1994 when he opened a booby-trapped briefcase in his newspaper's offices. He had picked up the case that morning from the left-luggage section at a Moscow train station after being told it contained documents exposing corruption in the armed forces. The editors of Kholodov's daily, \"Moskovsky Komsomolets\", accused the Russian military leadership (Defence Minister Grachev in particular) of ordering the killing. The military denied involvement. Speaking as a witness in court some six years later, Pavel Grachev claimed that \"some of my subordinates misunderstood my words\".\n\nLocal and foreign correspondents had already died in Moscow and elsewhere in the country (see List of journalists killed in Russia), but this was the first indisputable targeting of a journalist for his work. Kholodov's murder sent shockwaves through Russia's media community. Reaction abroad was muted, apart from professional media monitors and human rights organisations, and after December 1994 his killing was overshadowed by the onset of the First Chechen War. Kholodov's violent death personalized the risk faced by reporters in Russia, and the long drawn-out investigation and subsequent failure to convict the suspects had a chilling effect on investigative journalism in the country's newly free media.\n\nThe case remains unique. With one exception (Oleg Sedinko in 2002), explosives have never again been used to kill a journalist in Russia; and unlike the ongoing spate of contract killings no evidence was presented in court that money had been paid to Kholodov's alleged killers. They were acting, apparently, to avoid the displeasure of their superiors and to advance their careers.\n\nThe trial of six defendants, four of them serving military officers, began in 2000 at the Moscow District Military Court (see Russian courts). They were acquitted in 2002 and again, after a second trial, in 2004. On both occasions the Prosecutor General's Office protested against the verdict to the Russian Supreme Court. \n\nKholodov's elderly parents and their lawyers alleged improprieties in the conduct of the trial and the behaviour of the different judges presiding over the two trials (the second of whom, Yevgeny Zubov, would be in charge of the trial of Anna Politkovskaya's alleged killers). An attempt was made to have a complaint about the lack of a fair trial examined before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It was rejected on the grounds that the murder preceded Russia's full accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 1998. By 2004 the killing was also technically beyond the statute of limitation for murder laid down in Russia's 1960 Criminal Code. Speaking in Germany in 2008, however, President Dmitry Medvedev said that the killings of certain journalists were of such importance that there should be no time limit for the prosecution of those responsible. Kholodov's case was still unsolved as of 2009.\n\n\n"}

It is the administrative capital of the Zambezia Province and the province's largest city, and stands from the mouth of the Rio dos Bons Sinais (or \"River of the Good Signs\"). The river was named when Vasco da Gama, on his way to India, reached it and saw \"good signs\" that he was on the right path. The town was the end point of David Livingstone's west-to-east crossing of south-central Africa in 1856. Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique, and many residents of the areas surrounding Quelimane speak Portuguese. The most common local language is Chuabo. Quelimane, along with much of Zambezia Province, is extremely prone to floods during Mozambique's rainy season. The most recent bout of severe flooding took place in January 2007.\n\nThe town originated as a Swahili trade centre, and then grew as a slave market. Quelimane was founded by Muslim traders (see Kilwa Sultanate) and was one of the oldest towns in the region.\n\nThe origins of the name 'Quelimane' are obscure. One tradition alleges that Vasco da Gama, in 1498, inquired about the name of the place from some inhabitants laboring in the fields outside the settlement. Thinking he was asking what they were doing, they simply replied \"kuliamani\" ('we are cultivating').\n\nAn alternative explanation is that when the Portuguese reached the settlement, they were welcomed by a notable Arab, or half Arab, who acted as interpreter between them and the natives. The name which the Portuguese applied to this individual, and his settlement, was 'Quelimane' (pronounced Kelimãn), because in the corrupt Arabic spoken on the East African coast 'Kalimãn' is the word for 'Interpreter'. In Swahili it is 'Mkalimani'.\n\nIn 1761, the city became a town. Until 1853 trade was forbidden to any other than Portuguese. Sisal plantations were organized by Swiss planters in the beginning of the 20th century, namely Joseph Émile Stucky de Quay. The town started to grow and attracted several communities from different backgrounds, including Muslims and Indians, and new infrastructure was built by the Portuguese authorities. Its busy port had tea, grown and processed in the district of Zambézia (particularly important in the region around Gurúè, former \"Vila Junqueiro\"), as its major export. Coconut was also produced and transformed in the city. By 1970, Quelimane had 71,786 inhabitants.\n\nMozambique became independent from Portugal in 1975, after the April 1974 Carnation Revolution at Lisbon. Although its location on the Rio dos Bons Sinais is less important today than in the past, Quelimane remains a major town with a large hospital, two cathedrals, a mosque, and a public university for teachers. Due to its heat, humidity, and distance from the beach, Quelimane is not among Mozambique's major tourist destinations. However, its status as a provincial capital and the fourth-largest city in Mozambique and the increasing ease of access by plane (Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique runs flights) and road contribute to a small but relatively steady stream of visitors. In addition, Quelimane is home to branches of many international NGOs, and frequent visits from foreign aid consultants, workers, and government officials also contribute to the economy. The city received a further boost when Quelimane hosted the Ninth Annual Frelimo Party Convention in November 2006. After decades of municipal decline, the current mayor, Manuel de Araujo, is reportedly overseeing a renewed civic effort at economic and infrastructural restoration .\n\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Diocese of Quelimane (Catholic Church), (Reformed Church in Mozambique (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Igreja Presbiteriana de Moçambique (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Convenção Baptista de Moçambique (Baptist World Alliance), Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assemblies of God, Zion Christian Church. There are also Muslim mosques.\n\nQuelimane has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification \"Aw\").\n\nQuelimane is twinned with:\n\n"}

It is still commonly used by linguists working on, among others, Slavic, Uralic, Semitic languages and for the languages of the Caucasus and of India; however, Uralists commonly use a variant known as the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet. Despite its name, the term \"Americanist phonetic alphabet\" has always been widely used outside the Americas. For example, a version of it is the standard for the transcription of Arabic in articles published in the , the journal of the German Oriental Society.\n\nCertain symbols in NAPA have been used as obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet in certain transcriptions. Over the years, NAPA has drawn closer to the IPA. However, there remain significant differences. Among these are:\n\n\nJohn Wesley Powell used an early set of phonetic symbols in his publications (particularly Powell 1880) on American language families, although he chose symbols which had their origins in work by other phoneticians and American writers (\"e.g.\", Pickering 1820; Cass 1821a, 1821b; Hale 1846; Lepsius 1855, 1863; Gibbs 1861; and Powell 1877). The influential anthropologist Franz Boas used a somewhat different set of symbols (Boas 1911). In 1916, a publication by the American Anthropological Society greatly expanded upon Boas's alphabet. This same alphabet was discussed and modified in articles by Bloomfield & Bolling (1927) and Herzog \"et al.\" (1934). The Americanist notation may be seen in the journals \"American Anthropologist\", \"International Journal of American Linguistics\", and \"Language\". Useful sources explaining the symbols – some with comparisons of the alphabets used at different times – are Campbell (1997:xii-xiii), Goddard (1996:10-16), Langacker (1972:xiii-vi), Mithun (1999:xiii-xv), and Odden (2005).\n\nIt is often useful to compare the Americanist tradition with another widespread tradition, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Unlike the IPA, Americanist phonetic notation does not require a strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Latin alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature is that, to represent some of the same sounds, the Americanist tradition relies heavily on letters modified with diacritics; whereas the IPA, which reserves diacritics for other specific uses, gave Greek and Latin letters new shapes. These differing approaches reflect the traditions' differing philosophies. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from typefaces of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more cost-efficient, as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.\n\nAbercrombie (1991:44-45) recounts the following concerning the Americanist tradition:\n\nThere is no central authority. The Western Institute for Endangered Language Documentation (WIELD) recommends the following conventions:\n\nAdvanced is and retracted is . Geminate is or . Glottalization is e.g. or (ejectives are not distinguished from other types of glottalization). \nPalatalization is written . Labialization, velarization, aspiration, voicelessness and prenasalization are as in the IPA. Pharyngeals, epiglottals and glottals are as in the IPA, as are implosives and clicks. \n\nNotes:\n\nMost languages only have one phonemic rhotic consonant (only about 18% of the world's languages have more than one rhotic). As a result, rhotic consonants are generally transcribed with the character. This usage is common practice in Americanist and also other notational traditions (such as the IPA). This lack of detail, although economical and phonologically sound, requires a more careful reading of a given language's phonological description to determine the precise phonetics. A list of rhotics is given below.\n\nOther flaps are etc.\n\nThere are many alternate symbols seen in Americanist transcription. Below are some equivalent symbols matched with the symbols shown in the consonant chart above.\n\n\nThe use of the standard IPA belted l (ɬ) for the voiceless lateral fricative is becoming increasingly common.\n\nAccording to Pullum & Ladusaw (1996), current Americanist symbols are closer to the IPA. There is however little standardization of rhotics, and may be either retroflex or uvular, though as noted above or may be a retroflex flap vs as a uvular trill. Apart from the ambiguity of the rhotics below, and minor graphic variants (ȼ g γ for c ɡ ɣ and the placement of the diacritic in g̑ γ̑), this is compatible with the WIELD recommendations. Only precomposed affricates are shown below; others may be indicated by digraphs (e.g. ).\n\nEjectives and implosives follow the same conventions as in the IPA, apart from the ejective apostrophe being placed above the base letter.\n\nThe journal \"Anthropos\" published the alphabet to be used in their articles in 1907. Although European, it is the same basic system that Sapir and Boas introduced to the United States. Transcription is italic, without other delimiters.\n\nPalatalized consonants are written with an acute - ' etc. Semivowels are ' etc.\n\nWIELD recommends the following conventions. It doesn't provide characters for distinctions that aren't attested in the literature:\n\nNo distinction is made between front and central for the lowest unrounded vowels. Diphthongs are e.g. or , depending on phonological analysis. Nasal vowels are e.g. . Long vowels are e.g. . A three-way length distinction may be or . Primary and secondary stress are e.g. and . Voicelessness is e.g. , as in the IPA. Creak, murmur, rhoticity et al. are as in the IPA. \n\nAccording to Pullum & Ladusaw (1996), current Americanist usage is more-or-less as follows (no system has been standardized):\n\nVowels are inconsistent between languages. \" etc. may be used for unrounded central vowels, and the -based letters are poorly defined, with height and rounding confounded. \nThere are actually three heights of low front and back vowels. \" is also seen for a low back vowel.\n\nReduced (obscure) vowels are ' etc. There are also extra-high vowels ' etc.\n\nBloch & Trager (1942) proposed the following schema, which was never used. They use a single dot for central vowels and a dieresis to reverse backness. The only central vowels with their own letters are , which already has a dot, and , which would not be distinct if formed with a dot.\n\nKurath (1939) is as follows. Enclosed in parentheses are rounded vowels. Apart from and some differences in alignment, it is essentially the IPA.\n\nChomsky & Halle (1968) proposed the following schema, which was hardly ever used. In addition to the table, there was for an unstressed reduced vowel.\n\nDiacritics are widely used in Americanist notation. Unlike the IPA, which seeks to use as few diacritics as possible, the Americanist notation uses a narrow set of symbols and then relies on diacritics to indicate a sound's phonetic value.\n\nThe following charts were agreed by committee of the American Anthropological Association in 1916.\n\nThe vowel chart is based on the classification of H. Sweet. The high central vowels are differentiated by moving the centralizing dot to the left rather than with a cross stroke. IPA equivalents are given in a few cases that may not be clear. \n\nNotes:\n\nFollowing are symbols that differ among well-known Americanist sources.\n\n\n\n"}

Provincial level Associations had already emerged. One of the main grievances for the associations revolved around the difficulties for Indians to obtain entry into the civil service. In 1858, Queen Victoria had proclaimed equal treatment for Indians. But very few Indians had received an opportunity to be admitted. British officials were hesitant to accept Indians as partners in the administration. With that perspective, it appeared that granting a few concessions of representation in the provincial and imperial legislatures to the native elite would be a lesser evil. The non-monopolising participation of Indians in the legislatures was to be an enhancement for British rule.\n\nSuch a limited reform was initiated in 1892 the Indian National Congress' clamour for more legislative representation. The process was limited to proposing candidates whom the government could nominate for the parliaments. Indians were still outnumbered by British members in the legislatures and their abilities were limited to speeches and debates. Nonetheless, the restricted enterprise attracted the attention of the Indian leadership and the 1892 charm of the Congress declined.\n\nThe Liberal Party won the 1906 general election in Britain. Subsequently, liberal philosopher John Morley became Secretary of State for India. Morley wished to gather moderate Indians because of the armed activities by the young nationalists, and through this wanted to keep the moderates away from the radical members of the Congress. The moderates too were enthusiastic, expecting more from Morley than he had countenanced. Additionally, Morley's judgement was guided by Lord Minto, the viceroy, and H.H. Risley, the Home Secretary. The latter opposed territorial representation and urged representation on the basis of the different interests in what he perceived to be the Indian social structure.\n\nA 1909 legislative enactment, called the Morley-Minto reforms, conferred some political reforms which encouraged the constitutionalists in the Congress. Indians who could be elected to the legislatures on the basis of the 1861 Indian Councils Act increased numerically. The executive remained under strong British control and the government's consultative mode remained unchanged. The reforms established Indian dominance in the provincial, but not central, legislative bodies. Elections, mainly indirect, were affirmed for all levels of society. The elected Indians were also enabled to debate budgetary and complementary matters and table resolutions.\n\nDespite these reforms the In members still reeled over electoral apportionment. Provinces were delegated electoral allocations and administrative changes hindered harmful fusion against the British rule. A major hindrance to coalitions were separate electorates.\n\nA momentous introduction in the reforms were the separate electorates where seats were reserved for Muslims and in which only Muslims would be polled. The implication that Muslims and their interests could only be protected by Muslims would influence Indian politics in the ensuing decades. The Muslim League had been founded in 1906 by an elite aiming to promote Muslim interests, prevent Hindu dominance over Muslims through a parliamentary system and to advance the Muslim perspective in the deliberations regarding constitutional reforms after October 1907. Minto heard in October 1906 a Muslim deputation which comprised 35 Muslims from all Indian provinces (except the Northwest Frontier). The principal organisers of the delegation and main supporters of the movement for separate electorates were Muslims from the UP. The delegation asked that the Muslims be given a 'fair share' in representation. The 'fair share' was to be determined by the numerical position of Muslims, their political significance and the Muslim contribution in defending the British empire.\n\nThe delegation stated that existing Muslim representation was inadequate and the election of Muslims was dependent on the Hindu majority, in which case the elected Muslims could not truly represent Muslims. Minto welcomed their 'representative character' and acknowledged and promoted the separate Muslim politics. The official British sympathy for the delegation aroused suspicion that the Viceroy had invited them instead of only meeting them. However, the British officials shared the Muslim League's fear of legislative outnumbering and accepted any assistance against Morley's democratic inclinations. Contrary to the 'command performance' hypothesis, the evidence demonstrates that the initiative for this meeting was taken by Muhsin-ul Mulk.\n\nBritish officials persuaded Minto of the deputation's representative character and the danger Muslim discontent could pose to the British rule. The British believed that by entreating separate Muslim representation they would simply be acknowledging the realities in India. Separate representation for Muslims was a subsidiary of the government's policy of identifying people by their religion and caste. Muslims were seen as a helpful and possibly loyal counterbalance against the Hindu population although they were also feared as extreme because of their role in the 1857 revolt and the assassination in 1872 of the Viceroy, Lord Mayo.\n\nMorley wished a reconciliation between territorial representation and Muslim demands but Risley backed the separate electorates and either convinced Morley or dampened his disapproval of them. The Muslim League's insistence on separate electorates and reserved seats in the Imperial Council were granted in the Indian Councils Act after the League held protests in India and lobbied London. The party's leadership was successful in converting Minto's unclear support of their 1906 delegation into a political fact.\n\n\n"}

His younger brother, Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson (1696-1764), was Minister of War from 1743 to 1747.\n\nRené-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy was born 18 October 1694, eldest son of Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson (1652-1721) and Marguerite Le Fèvre de Caumartin (1672-1719). He had a younger brother, Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson (1696-1764), who served as Minister of War from 1743 to 1747.\n\nHis father was Lieutenant General of Police and Controller-General of Finances, one of the most important positions in the Ancien Régime. He was a member of the \"Noblesse de robe\" or Nobles of the robe, a class that formed the Second Estate whose rank derived from holding judicial or administrative posts. They were usually hard-working professionals, unlike the aristocratic \"Noblesse d'épée\" or Nobles of the Sword. His grandfather and great-grandfather both served as French ambassador to the Republic of Venice.\n\nD'Argneson qualified as a lawyer, and held successively the posts of councillor at the Parlement (1716), \"maître des requêtes\" (1718), councillor of state (1719), and Intendant of justice, police and finance in Hainaut. During his five years’ tenure of the last office he was mainly employed in provisioning the troops, who were suffering from the economic confusion resulting from John Law's system and the aftermath of the Mississippi Bubble.\n\nD'Argenson returned to court in 1724 to exercise his functions as councillor of state. At that time he had the reputation of being a conscientious man, but ill-adapted to intrigue, and was nicknamed \"la bête\". He entered into relations with the philosophers, and was won over to the ideas of reform. He was the friend of Voltaire, who had been a fellow-student of his at the Jesuit college Louis-le-Grand, and frequented the Club de l'Entresol, the history of which he wrote in his memoirs. It was then that he prepared his \"Considérations sur le gouvernement de la France\", which was published posthumously by his son.\n\nD'Argenson was also the friend and counsellor of the minister Germain Louis Chauvelin. In May 1744 he was appointed member of the council of finance, and in November of the same year King Louis XV chose him as secretary of state for foreign affairs, his brother, Marc-Pierre, Comte d'Argenson, being at the same time secretary of state for war. France was at that time engaged in the War of the Austrian Succession, and the government had been placed by Louis XV virtually in the hands of the two brothers. The marquis d’Argenson endeavoured to reform the system of international relations. He dreamed of a \"European Republic\", and wished to establish arbitration between nations in pursuance of the ideas of his friend the abbé de Saint-Pierre. But he failed to realize any part of his projects. The generals negotiated in opposition to his instructions; his colleagues laid the blame on him; the intrigues of the courtiers passed unnoticed by him; whilst the secret diplomacy of the king neutralized his initiative. He concluded the marriage of the Louis, the Dauphin to \nMaria, a daughter of King Augustus III of Poland, but was unable to prevent the election of the Francis, Grand-Duke of Tuscany as Holy Roman Emperor in 1745.\n\nOn 10 January 1747 Louis XV thanked d'Argenson for his services. He then retired into private life, eschewed the court, associated with Voltaire, Condillac and d’Alembert, and spent his declining years in working at the Académie des Inscriptions, of which he was appointed president by the king in 1747, and revising his \"Mémoires\". Voltaire, in one of his letters, declared him to be \"the best citizen that had ever tasted the ministry\". He died on 26 January 1757.\n\nD'Argenson left a large number of manuscript works, of which his son, Marc Antoine René, Marquis de Paulmy, published the \"Considérations sur le gouvernement de France\" (Amsterdam, 1764) and \"Essais dans le goût de ceux de Montaigne\" (Amsterdam, 1785). The latter, which contains many useful biographical notes and portraits of his contemporaries, was republished in 1787 as \"Loisirs d’un ministre d’état\". D'Argenson's most important work, however, is his \"Mémoires\", covering in great detail the years 1725 to 1756, with an introductory part giving his recollections since the year 1696. They are, as they were intended to be, valuable \"materials for the history of his time\". There are two important editions, the first, with some letters, not elsewhere published, by the marquis d’Argenson, his great-grand-nephew (5 vols., Paris, 1857 et seq.); the second, more correct, but less complete, published by J. B. Rathery, for the Société de l’Histoire de France (9 vols., Paris, 1859 et seq.). The other works of the marquis d’Argenson, in MS., were destroyed in the fire at the Louvre library in 1871.\n\nD'Argenson married and had a son:\n\n"}

While he was still a young boy, his family immigrated to Canada, and it was from the corps in Belleville that he entered training, becoming an officer in 1935. A two-year corps command was followed by 10 years of service in the editorial department at territorial headquarters, where he became assistant editor of \"The War Cry\". During that time he compiled a history of the first 50 years of Salvation Army ministry in Canada, entitled \"What Hath God Wrought?\"\n\nCaptain Brown and Lieutenant Jean Barclay were married 15 September 1939, and they gave 42 years of joint service before retiring from active leadership. They had two daughters, Heather Jean Brown and Beverley Ann Brown.\n\nIn 1962, the then Brigadier Brown was appointed as territorial youth secretary, an appointment where he gave vigorous leadership to the young Salvationists of Canada and Bermuda. Always an inspired leader of meetings and a fascinating speaker, his ministry among the young people of the territory left an indelible mark upon the lives and service of many of them.\n\nIn 1964, there came a return to public relations work, this time at international headquarters, where Lieutenant-Colonel Brown was appointed as secretary for public relations, being promoted to the rank of colonel just a few months later. His imaginative leadership gave birth to the 'For God's Sake Care!' campaign, which raised the army's profile significantly throughout the United Kingdom, and changed the face of The Salvation Army's public relations work for all time. It was also under his direction that advisory boards were established in the UK.\n\nBrown had a long-standing involvement with the Rotary Club movement, rising to high office in the London club and internationally. In his capacity as a Rotarian he was invited to address many international conferences, including those in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1973 and in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1975. Whenever he addressed Rotary, he proudly presented the story of God's Army and its contribution to the relief of suffering and need around the world.\n\nFollowing an outstanding period of service in public relations, Commissioner Brown was appointed chief of the staff (the army's second-in-command) in October 1969, where he served for five years before returning to Canada as territorial commander in 1974. Three years later, the High Council of The Salvation Army elected him to become the 11th General of The Salvation Army. He took office on 5 July 1977.\n\nUpon election, when asked what he wanted Salvationists to do, Brown said, 'Everything they can to make better known Jesus Christ and his saving power as the only hope for a sinning, suffering world; everything they can to demonstrate indisputably in what they say and do that the grace of God enables men and women to live clean and holy lives filled with the joy of service to God and their fellows; in short, everything they can to bring Heaven to earth.'\n\nBrown and his wife travelled extensively during the four-and-a-half years he was in office. In 1980, Brown inaugurated the International Staff Songsters in London, and he continued to maintain a lively interest in their ministry, both in the UK and many other countries where they have travelled.\n\nBrown received many honours during his lifetime, recognising his contribution to the field of literature as well as his work in the interests of the poor and underprivileged of society. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1978, an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 and, also in 1981, an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Asbury Theological Seminary and an honorary Doctor of Divinity from the Olivet Seminary in the USA.\n\nMany books were written by Brown, including \"What Hath God Wrought?\", \"The Gate and the Light\" (autobiography), \"The Mountain the Wind Blew Here\", \"With Christ at the Table and Occupied Manger - Unoccupied Tomb\".\n\nBrown died at age 92 in a hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. His remains were interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, Ontario, Canada in The Salvation Army plot.\n\nGeneral Brown especially took interest in Nigeria, and visited Lagos on occasion where he was greeted warmly by his lieutenants. Whilst in Lagos he stayed with Salvationists Douglas and Pamela Smith, Douglas being the son of Brigadier Earnest Smith.\n\n"}
{"id": "2021843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021843", "title": "Svend Foyn", "text": "Svend Foyn\n\nSvend Foyn (July 9, 1809 – November 30, 1894) was a Norwegian whaling, shipping magnate and philanthropist. He pioneered revolutionary methods for hunting and processing whales. Svend Foyn introduced the modern harpoon cannon and brought whaling into a modern age. He is also recognized as a pioneer who introduced sealing to Vestfold County.\n\nSvend Foyn was born in the neighborhood of Foynegården at Tønsberg in Vestfold, Norway. He was the son of shipmaster Laurentius Foyn (1772–1813) and Benthe Marie Ager (1781–1842). Foyn was fatherless at four years of age and his mother came to characterize his upbringing. By age 11, Foyn sent to sea on the family ships. He took navigational exams in Kristiansand at age 19 and from 1833 he was a master sailor.\n\nHis ship initially transported lumber from Sweden and Norway to European ports and returned with manufactured goods. Started in 1846, Foyn was on the expedition for seals and walrus. By the 1860s, he had a fleet of whaling ships. In 1863, he built the world's first steam-powered catcher. Within four years he experimented with whaling on the coast of Finnmark.\n\nFoyn was the first to hit the whale with grenade harpoon. Svend Foyn patented his grenade harpoon gun in 1870. He modified existing designs and utilized ideas developed by Erik Eriksen. It consisted of a cannon that fired a barbed explosive head harpoon. Aimed and fired, the harpoon barb would hook into the whale. A moment later an explosive charge in the head of the harpoon would inflict a mortal wound. Then the whale was retrieved by a winch. Once alongside the whaling vessel, the whale was pumped full of air to keep it afloat, as the whale was moved to the location of processing.\n\nThe whole process of whaling was changed drastically when Svend Foyn invented the exploding harpoon. By doing so, he removed much of the danger from whaling although it remained a very dangerous undertaking. His invention increased the efficiency by which whales could be captured and made it possible to hunt the larger and faster rorquals, the largest group of baleen whales.\n\nSvend Foyn introduced mechanized, steam-powered catcher boats equipped with bow-chaser deck cannons and heavy-caliber harpoons that exploded on impact. Foyn constructed his 86-ton, seven-knot \"Spes et Fides\", the first steam-powered whale catcher. The ship was equipped with seven whale guns separately mounted on the forecastle, each firing a harpoon and grenade. The vessel was 94 feet (29 m) long, with a 20-horsepower (15-kW) engine. It could reach a speed of 7 knots (13 km/h).\n\nWith this development, he launched Norway into a new and profitable industry. After years of perfecting a cannon that could fire a grenade and harpoon simultaneously, Foyn finally managed to catch 30 whales in 1868. These increased efficiency and volume, enabling the harvest not only of all of the species that had been hunted for, but also the largest species which had eluded all previous hunting technologies. The whaling industry was in decline when Foyn first began his development of the bow-mounted harpoon cannon. Foyn's eventual successful development of the cannon, in combination with fast and sleek steam-powered catcher vessels, ushered in a modern whaling industry that was to become dominated first by the Norwegians, then the British and finally the Russians and Japanese.\nThe Antarctic Expedition of 1894–95 was funded by Svend Foyn and led by Henrik Johan Bull. The two-year expedition was a whaling expedition that sailed to the Ross Sea aboard the ship \"Antarctic\". The crew included Carsten Borchgrevink, who later led the Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica.\n\nBy processing the whale's raw materials in its own facilities, Foyn steadily increase his profit and accumulated a considerable fortune. He donated funds for several purposes including worker housing in Tonsberg (\"Svend Foyns Arbeiderboliger\"). He gave funds to benefit his employees and later bequeathed his fortune to a mission fund. Foyn restored and protected workers' homes.\n\nIn 1865 there were 73 flats and 303 residents. There was a library, prayer room and the country's first kindergarten. Svend Foyn was not only a man before his time in the modern whaling industry, but also as regards social conditions. Svend and Lena Foyn's Memorial, a home for elderly ladies was founded by Lena Foyn in 1896. Svend Foyn Chapel (\"Svend Foyns bedehus\") was consecrated November 5, 1876. There was seating for 500 people and at the time it was among Norway's largest and most beautiful chapels.\n\nSvend Foyn wed Elise Amalie Tvede in 1839 in a marriage which ended in an amicable separation in 1842. His former wife, later known as Elise Wærenskjold, immigrated to Texas in 1847. Foyn maintained a long distance friendship with his ex-wife throughout the remainder of their lives. In 1849, Foyn married Magdalene Margrethe \"Lena\" Bull, (1824–1905), daughter of the master and shipowner Henrik Johan Bull (1793–1826) and Andrea Mathea Bull (1796–1844).\n\nFoyn was entered as a Knight in the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1853, was promoted to Commander in 1870 and received the Grand Cross in 1893. Foyn died in 1894 in Nøtterøy, followed by the death of his widow Lena in 1905. Both were buried in Tønsberg gamle kirkegård located in Tønsberg city center. \nThe couple had established the Svend Foyn and Wife Mission Fund (\"Svend Foyn and Hustrus Missionsfond\") with an endowment of over . The fund was intended for the benefit of their workforce and for the welfare of their families.\n\nThe former residence of Svend and Lena Foyn on Storgaten in Tønsberg is a protected house.

Before then, its currency, the litas, was pegged to the euro at 3.4528 litas to 1 euro.\n\nAll members of the European Union, except Denmark are required by treaty to join the euro once certain economic criteria have been met. The Lithuanian litas participated in ERM II since 28 June 2004, and was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.45280 litai = €1. Lithuania originally set 1 January 2007 as their target date for joining the euro, and in March 2006 requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the currency. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met four of the five criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that \"there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation.\" Lithuania is the only country initially to have been denied approval to adopt the euro after requesting a convergence check.\n\nIn December 2006 the government approved a new convergence plan, which pushed the expected adoption date to post-2010 due to inflation. In 2007, Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas stated that he hoped for adoption around 2010–11. Generally high inflation, which reached a peak of 12.7% in June 2008 (well above the 4.2% limit of the time), delayed Lithuania's adoption of the euro. By the time of the 2010 European debt crisis, the expected switch over date had been put further back to 2014. Lithuania expressed interest in a suggestion from the IMF that countries which are not able to meet the Maastricht criteria be able to \"partially adopt\" the euro, using the currency but not getting a seat at the European Central Bank. Interviews with the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister in May and August 2012 respectively highlighted that Lithuania still aimed to join the euro, but would not set a target date until the state of the eurozone post-crisis was clear.\n\nDuring the 2012 Lithuanian parliamentary election campaign, the Social Democrats were reported to prefer delaying the euro adoption, from the previous 2014 target until 1 January 2015. When the second round of the elections were concluded in October, the Social Democrats and two coalition parties won a majority and formed the new government, and the coalition parties were expected to accept the proposed delay in adoption of the euro. When Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius presented his new government in December, eurozone accession as soon as possible was mentioned as one of the key priorities for the government. The Prime Minister said: \"January 2015 is a feasible date. But things can also turn out, that we may try to adopt the euro together with Latvia in January 2014. Let the first quarter (of 2013) pass, and we'll give it a thought.\" However, in January 2013 the Prime Minister announced that the government and the Bank of Lithuania had agreed on a target date of 2015. In February 2013, the government of Lithuania approved a plan for euro adoption in 2015.\n\nAccording to figures from the Bank of Lithuania, Lithuania had met 4 out of the 5 criteria by October 2013, the exception being the government deficit of 3.2% of GDP, exceeding the limit of 3.0%. The Lithuanian government expected this to decline to 2.9% by the first quarter of 2014. In April 2014, the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gave their preliminary consent for Lithuania to join the eurozone on 1 January 2015, having concluded that the country was complying with all the criteria according to economic data from the first months of 2014. Lithuania's parliament approved a euro changeover law in April 2014, and in their biennial reports released on 4 June the European Commission found that the country satisfied the convergence criteria. The European Central Bank does not conclude on whether the country is ready to join the euro area. On 16 July the European Parliament voted in favour of Lithuania adopting the euro. On 23 July the EU Council of Ministers approved the decision, clearing the way for Lithuania to adopt the euro on 1 January 2015.\n\nA poll by Eurobarometer in April 2013 found that 41% of Lithuanians supported switching to the euro, while 55% were opposed. This was a decrease in support of 3% from a year earlier. A September 2014 Eurobarometer poll found that 49% of Lithuanians were opposed to the introduction of the euro and 47% supported it.\n\nOpinion polling in the run-up to the adoption of the euro produced a mixed set of results. A Baltic Surveys (Baltijos Tyrimai) face-to-face interview survey for the eurosceptic Europeans United for Democracy party conducted on 14–24 November found that 49% of Lithuanians disagree with their Government's decision to introduce the euro, while 26% of Lithuanians approved (5% fully, 21% rather in favour). 57% of respondents said the Government acted wrongly by introducing the euro without a referendum on the issue. However, a poll conducted by Berent Research Baltic for the Bank of Lithuania between 3 and 26 November showed that 53% of the population were in favour of the new currency while 39% were sceptical.\n\nThe designs of the Lithuanian coins share a similar national side for all denominations, featuring the Vytis symbol and the name of the country, \"\"Lietuva\"\". The design was announced on 11 November 2004 following a public opinion poll conducted by the Bank of Lithuania. It was created by the sculptor Antanas Žukauskas. The only difference between the coins is that the one and two euro coins have vertical lines on the outer circle, the fifty, twenty and ten cent coins have horizontal lines on the outer circle, and the five, two and one cent coins have no lines on the outer circle. In January 2014 it was announced that all coins will have \"2015\" printed on them to display the year of Lithuania's euro adoption. The Lithuanian Mint was chosen to mint the coins.\n\nFor the design of images on the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.\n\nLithuania officially joined the Eurozone at midnight on the morning of 1 January 2015, with the Lithuanian Central Bank offering an exchange rate of 3.4528 LTL to one euro. Immediately after the start of the New Year, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius made the country's first cash withdrawal in euros. It was reported that nearly all of the nation's cash machines would be dispensing euros within 30 minutes of the New Year. In Brussels, the European Commission building was draped with a banner welcoming Lithuania to the Eurozone.\nThe European Commission recommended in November 2014 that Lithuania extend the legally required dual price display period by six additional months, so that it would last until 31 December 2015. Lithuania did not adopt the recommendation and the required dual price display ended on 1 July 2015.\n\nOn 17 June 2014 the Deutsche Bundesbank released a statement stating that \"Lithuania could cause the ECB Governing Council's voting rights to rotate. The virtually certain introduction of the euro in this small Baltic nation at the beginning of next year would cause the number of national central bank (NCB) governors on the ECB Governing Council to exceed 18 for the first time. It would trigger a changed voting procedure designed to ensure that decisions can still be taken effectively in a growing Eurosystem. This would pave the way for the introduction of a modified voting system similar to that of the US Federal Reserve System.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2021871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021871", "title": "Planar chirality", "text": "Planar chirality\n\nPlanar chirality, also known as 2d chirality, is the special case of chirality for two dimensions.\n\nMost fundamentally, planar chirality is a mathematical term, finding use in chemistry, physics and related physical sciences, for example, in astronomy, optics and metamaterials. Recent occurrences in latter two fields are dominated by microwave and terahertz applications as well as micro- and nanostructured planar interfaces for infrared and visible light.\n\nThis term is used in chemistry contexts, e.g., for a chiral molecule lacking an asymmetric carbon atom, but possessing two non-coplanar rings that are each dissymmetric and which cannot easily rotate about the chemical bond connecting them: 2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl is perhaps the simplest example of this case. Planar chirality is also exhibited by molecules like (\"E\")-cyclooctene, some di- or poly-substituted metallocenes, and certain monosubstituted paracyclophanes. Nature rarely provides planar chiral molecules, cavicularin being an exception.\n\nTo assign the configuration of a planar chiral molecule, begin by selecting the pilot atom, which is the highest priority of the atoms that is not in the plane, but are directly attached to an atom in the plane. Next, assign the priority of three adjacent in-plane atoms, starting with the atom attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and preferentially assigning in order of highest priority if there is a choice. Then setting the pilot atom to behind the three atoms in question, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R, otherwise it is assigned as S.\n\nPapakostas \"et al.\" observed in 2003 that planar chirality affects the polarization of light diffracted by arrays of planar chiral microstructures, where large polarization changes of opposite sign were detected in light diffracted from planar structures of opposite handedness.\n\nThe study of planar chiral metamaterials has revealed that planar chirality is also associated with an optical effect in non-diffracting structures: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly polarized waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.\nThe asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect is referred to as circular conversion dichroism.\nLike the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.\n\nAchiral components may form a chiral arrangement. In this case, chirality is not an intrinsic property of the components, but rather imposed extrinsically by their relative positions and orientations. This concept is typically applied to experimental arrangements, for example, an achiral (meta)material illuminated by a beam of light, where the illumination direction makes the whole experiment different from its mirror image. Extrinsic planar chirality results from illumination of any periodically structured interface for suitable illumination directions. Starting from normal incidence onto a periodically structured interface, extrinsic planar chirality arises from tilting the interface around any axis that does not coincide with a line of mirror symmetry of the interface. In the presence of losses, extrinsic planar chirality can result in circular conversion dichroism, as described above.\n\nConventional mirrors reverse the handedness of circularly polarized waves upon reflection. In contrast, a chiral mirror reflects circularly polarized waves of one handedness without handedness change, while absorbing circularly polarized waves of the opposite handedness. A perfect chiral mirror exhibits circular conversion dichroism with ideal efficiency. Chiral mirrors can be realized by placing a planar chiral metamaterial in front of a conventional mirror. The concept has been exploited in holography to realize independent holograms for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. Active chiral mirrors that can be switched between left and right, or chiral mirror and conventional mirror, have been reported.\n\n"}

She is best known for her action comic strip, \"Miss Fury\", featuring the first female action hero created by a woman.\n\nBorn June Tarpé Mills on 25 February 1918 in Brooklyn, New York, she signed her work by her middle name \"Tarpé\" to conceal her sex. She also used the pseudonyms \"Edgar Allen, Jr.\" and \"Nella.\"\n\nMills worked as a model while helping to support her deceased sister's children and her widowed mother along with her academic studies. She attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, New York, and she received her higher education at the Pratt Institute in New York.\n\nMills' professional career began as a fashion illustrator. She created several action comics characters (\"Devil's Dust\", \"The Cat Man\", \"The Purple Zombie\" and \"Daredevil Barry Finn\") before creating her most remembered character, \"Miss Fury,\" in 1941. Mills also wrote original scripts, penciled, and inked stories for these comic book series prior to \"Miss Fury:\" \"Funny Pages, Star Comics, Amazing Mystery Funnies, Amazing Man Comics, Masked Marvel, Prize Comics, Target Comics,\" and \"Reg'lar Fellers Heroic Comics.\"\n\n\"Miss Fury\" ran until 1952, when Tarpé Mills mostly retired from the comics industry. She briefly returned in 1971 with \"Our Love Story\" for Marvel Comics and in 1979 began work on a \"Miss Fury\" graphic novel which would remain unfinished.\n\nShe died on 12 December 1988 in Brooklyn, New York, and is buried in Forest Green Park Cemetery in Morganville, New Jersey.\n\nJune Tarpe Mills was inducted into the ComicCon Eisner Hall of Fame on July 19, 2019.\n\nThe Bell Syndicate first published the \"Miss Fury\" comic strip (then titled \"The Black Fury\") on April 6, 1941, predating the first appearance of Wonder Woman by six months. The strip \"ran in full color in the Sunday comics pages for 351 consecutive weeks from 1942 through 1949, and was also collected in comic book form by Timely Comics.\" Circulation included over 100 newspapers at its most popular stage. As the \"Miss Fury\" strip became more popular, it eventually became public knowledge its creator was a woman.\n\nMiss Fury, the alter ego of socialite Marla Drake, was a character based loosely on Mills' own appearance.\n\nDuring World War II, \"Miss Fury\" was painted on the nose of three American warplanes in Europe and the South Pacific. Two of the recurring villains were the Nazi agents Erica Von Kampf and General Bruno. Mills' own white Persian cat Perri-Purr was introduced in the strip, and during World War II Perri-Purr became an unofficial mascot of the American troops.\n\nThe artwork was created in a glamorous style with considerable attention placed on the heroine's outfits. These outfits varied from lacy evening gowns and lingerie to bathing suits and athletic costumes. Mills' attention to fashion in \"Miss Fury\" was mirrored in the work of her contemporary Dalia Messick's \"Brenda Starr,\" and in this sense the women were ahead of their male counterparts who typically \"dressed [their] heroines in plain red dresses.\"\n\nCut-out paper fashion dolls were included for the first time in the comic-book reprints of \"Miss Fury\", leading Trina Robbins to guess that these books were intended for a female audience. Mills sent paper dolls to young women who had written fan mail requesting art.\n\n\"Miss Fury\" was notoriously full of \"kinkiness,\" including “whips, spike heels, female-on-female violence, and lingerie scenes.” One character's costume in a 1947 publication \"was so daring that 37 newspapers cancelled the strip” that day. A bathing scene from the tenth \"Miss Fury\" Sunday page on June 8, 1941 ran in newspapers at the time but was later excluded from the 1942 Timely Comics reprint.\n\nTrina Robbins said on \"Miss Fury\":“The only outrage I have seen were those newspapers that censored Mills’s strip in which she dressed her nightclub entertainer character, Era, in an outfit that would not bother us in the least today. But it obviously shocked the pants – yes, verbal joke intended – off some people.\"\n\nMills' art in \"Miss Fury\" was modeled on the work of Milton Caniff. Her portrayal of action across multiple panels, as well as the natural poses and facial expressions of her characters, has been described as \"cinematic,\" echoing the film-noire style. Mills' characters also possessed a \"pinup quality.\"\n\nDean Mullaney, editor and publisher behind Eclipse Enterprises, wrote that “[Mills’] art is drawn very traditionally—no surprises, no ah-ha moments.”\n\nEvie Nagy for The Los Angeles Review of Books remarked that “the flow of Mills’s sequential art feels completely organic.\"\n\nJune Mills' legacy as the first woman to create a female action hero in comics was contextualized by Victoria Ingalls for the American Psychological Association. Out of a list of hundreds of female “superheroes” surveyed in her abstract, Ingalls identified only eleven as being created by a woman not working in a team with a male writer. Mills' Marla Drake is the chronological first of these eleven heroes.\n\nAccording to Mike Madrid in his book \"The Supergirls\", Marla Drake belongs to the “Debutante” caste of early comics female heroines, who include Sandra Knight (Phantom Lady), Dianne Grayton (Spider Widow), Diana Adams (Miss Masque), and Brenda Banks (Lady Luck). These characters form a ‘sorority’ of heiresses and socialites who had been forced into lives of propriety, submission, and “tedious leisure.” “Putting on a cape and mask liberated these women” to embrace their own identities, fight crime, and trade their “entitled boredom” for thrills.\n\nMadrid wrote, “Mills’ approach to a secret identity seemed more realistic, injected with a feminine practicality.”\n\n\"Miss Fury: Sensational Sundays 1941-1944\" was a 2012 Eisner award nominee.\n\nMills was named one of 16 nominees to be inducted to the 2018 Eisner Hall of Fame (alongside Jackie Ormes, Charles Addams, Karen Berger, Dave Gibbons, and Rumiko Takahashi).\n\nJune Tarpe Mills was inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame on July 19, 2019 at ComicCon International in San Diego.\n\n\n"}

The title comes from the expression printer's devil, an apprentice in the industry.\n\nThe initial plot set-up is based in part on the well-known deal with the devil motif: a mysterious, seemingly eccentric man (played by frequent \"Twilight Zone\" contributor Burgess Meredith) brings success to a local newspaper by working as its reporter and linotype operator, eventually revealing that he wants the editor's soul in exchange. This hour-long episode was written by Charles Beaumont, and based on his 1951 short story \"The Devil, You Say\".\n\nDouglas Winter (Robert Sterling), the editor of a newspaper called \"The Courier\", is being pushed out of business by a big conglomerate paper, \"The Gazette\". Though Douglas is an exceptionally kind and accommodating boss, his staff begin abandoning him when he becomes unable to pay them. After the linotype operator quits, the only remaining employees of \"The Courier\" are Douglas himself and his girlfriend, Jackie Benson (Pat Crowley). Douglas is an earnest dreamer who sees \"The Courier\" as his purpose in life; faced with its demise, he drives to a bridge to contemplate suicide. There he is approached by a strange man (Burgess Meredith) who introduces himself as \"Mr. Smith\" and says he came to town hoping to join \"The Courier\" as a linotype operator and reporter. Even after witnessing Mr. Smith's speed and precision with the linotype machine, Doug tries to talk him out of it, saying he cannot pay him or even resume operation of \"The Courier\" due to an overdue debt payment to the bank of nearly $5,000. Mr. Smith immediately loans him the $5,000.\n\nShortly after his hiring, Mr. Smith produces a report of a bank robbery that occurred just a half hour before. Business booms for the little newspaper, as Mr. Smith scoops \"The Gazette\" on dramatic news stories, with special editions which sometimes hit the streets barely two hours after the events happen. The owner of \"The Gazette\", Mr. Franklin, offers to buy out \"The Courier\". Though Douglas himself doubts that \"The Courier\" can stand up to Franklin's monopolizing tactics, assuming his recent success is down to luck, he refuses his offer. The day after, a fire burns down \"The Gazette\" building. When an edition of \"The Courier\" goes on sale just two hours after, Franklin accuses Doug of arson. Doug has witnesses to account for his whereabouts at the time, and when he asks Mr. Smith if he caused the fire, Smith successfully dodges the question.\n\nJackie, still suspicious of Mr. Smith, prods Douglas for information on where he came from, and says he should get rid of him now that the $5,000 loan has been repaid. Douglas refuses, and becomes irritable when she asks what he was doing at the bridge where he met Smith.\n\nAt last Mr. Smith reveals why he joined \"The Courier\": he wants Doug to sign a contract assuring Mr. Smith's continued services in exchange for Doug's soul. When Doug is reluctant, Mr. Smith uses a variation of doublethink, arguing that while he believes himself to be the devil, he is clearly mad, and to a sane sophisticated man like Doug things like souls and the devil clearly do not exist. Doug signs the contract.\n\nEventually, however, he comes to the conclusion that Mr. Smith is somehow causing the events that he writes about, and tells Mr. Smith he wants him gone. Smith says that is impossible now that the contract has been signed, and writes a story about Jackie being injured in an auto accident at 11:30—an hour and a half in the future. He tells Douglas that when he joined \"The Courier\" he modified the linotype machine so that anything typed on it happens, and will write that Jackie died of her injuries unless Douglas kills himself. In this way Smith could immediately claim his soul and move on to other clients, instead of having to work at \"The Courier\" for the rest of Douglas's natural life. Douglas tosses aside the offered gun and goes frantically searching for Jackie. Meanwhile, she confronts Mr. Smith. He agrees to leave town if she gives him a lift, and asks to drive.\n\nUnable to find Jackie, Doug returns to \"The Courier\" building and uses the linotype machine to write a new story. The car with Jackie and Mr. Smith runs off the road, but Jackie is uninjured, and Mr. Smith has vanished. Doug shows a confused Jackie the story he wrote, which says that Mr. Smith left town at 11:29, and that his contract with Doug was declared void due to Doug's not fully understanding the terms of the agreement. Douglas resumes running \"The Courier\" after having the infernal linotype machine destroyed, and hauled away.\n\n\n"}

Following spells with Newcastle United and Leeds United, he moved to Middlesbrough and scored the final goal at Ayresome Park among his 44 goals for Boro. When he was replaced by Brazilian Juninho he moved to Barnsley where he finished his career and also served as manager.\n\nHis uncle is another Scottish former pro footballer, Paul Hendrie. Paul has two sons (John's cousins) in the game; Lee Hendrie made a late substitute appearance for England in 1998 and Stuart Hendrie played for Morecambe.\n\nHendrie started his professional football career at Coventry City, originally signing as an apprentice in June 1980, and signing full-time forms in May 1981. He was a hit with Coventry's reserves, being top scorer in 1983–84, with ten goals from 25 games, but he struggled to break into the first team and played in just 21 league games during his time at Coventry. Instead he moved on a free transfer to Bradford City in 1984 following a loan spell with Hereford United.\n\nHendrie was one of two free transfers between the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, along with Dave Evans, as manager Trevor Cherry tried to build a team capable of promotion from Division Three. Hendrie was an ever-present in his first season scoring nine goals from his right wing position as City won the Division Three title. On the last day of that successful season his day was to turn into a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in a horrendous stand fire while playing Lincoln City.\n\nHendrie continued to be one of the first names of the City team-sheet following promotion and during his four seasons at City he missed just one league game. He won a series of fans' awards and nominations for the PFA teams in 1987 and 1988. He scored ten goals in 1985–86 and 14 more in 1986–87. Cherry had been replaced by Terry Dolan, who built a team pushing for promotion to Division One in 1987–88. Hendrie was one of the key men, scoring 13 goals, but he was sent off in a 2–2 draw at Manchester City on 23 April 1988. His subsequent suspension meant he missed the final league game of the season, as City lost 3–2 to Ipswich Town and missed out on promotion. It was the only league game Hendrie missed during his time at Valley Parade, and his 173 consecutive league appearances has only been beaten by Geoff Smith with City. Hendrie came back for the play-off games with Middlesbrough but after defeat he signed for Newcastle United for £500,000.\n\nHendrie's career stalled at Newcastle United in a difficult season for the Magpies and he soon moved on to Leeds United. He spent just one season at Leeds but was voted in the top 100 Leeds players in 2000.\n\nHe played as a deep-lying striker for Middlesbrough and helped them win promotion to the newly founded FA Premier League in 1992, where on 5 December 1992 he scored a hat-trick in a 3–2 win against Blackburn Rovers. Hendrie was their leading scorer in 1995 when they won promotion back to the top flight. He secured legendary status on Teesside by scoring the last ever goal at Ayresome Park.\n\nHe left the following year after losing his place in the first team to Juninho Paulista, and joined Division One side Barnsley. Once again, Hendrie contributed towards his club winning promotion as Barnsley finished Division One runners-up and became top division members for the first time in their history. Hendrie was unable to prevent Barnsley from suffering relegation in 1997–98, and after the end of the season he succeeded Danny Wilson as manager.\n\nJohn Hendrie was sacked on 19 April 1999 after just one season in charge of Barnsley, having failed to achieve a promotion play off place.\n\nBradford City\nLeeds United\n\nHendrie is married to Linda, with whom he has three sons, Joe, Luke and Jordan, and a daughter Lauren.

{"id": "2021902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021902", "title": "Flavio", "text": "Flavio\n\nFlavio, re de' Longobardi (\"Flavio, King of the Lombards\", HWV 16) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Matteo Noris's \"Flavio Cuniberto\". It was Handel's fourth full-length opera for the Royal Academy of Music. Handel had originally entitled the opera after the character of Emilia in the opera.\n\n\"Flavio\" is unusually concise for an opera by Handel of this period. It is also notable as a skillful blend of tragedy and comedy, both in the text and the music, and for being one of Handel's few operas to feature leading roles for all major voice categories of his day – soprano, contralto, castrato, tenor and bass.\n\nHandel completed the score only seven days before the premiere, at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket on 14 May 1723. There were eight performances in the premiere run. The work was revived on 18 April 1732, under the direction of the composer, for four performances.\n\nThere were no further revivals until it was rediscovered and performed in Göttingen on 2 July 1967. The first UK performance since Handel's time was on 26 August 1969 at the Unicorn Theatre in Abingdon-on-Thames, England. As with all Baroque opera seria, \"Flavio\" went unperformed for many years, but with the revival of interest in Baroque music and historically informed musical performance since the 1960s, \"Flavio\", like all Handel operas, receives performances at festivals and opera houses today. Among other productions, \"Flavio\" was performed at the New York City Opera in 2007 and by English Touring Opera in 2009.\n\nFlavio, King of Lombardy, is also King of Britain. He has two trusted, elderly counsellors, Lotario and Ugone. Lotario's daughter Emilia is engaged to Ugone's son, Guido. Ugone has another daughter, Teodata, who is young and famous for her great beauty. Teodata has a secret boyfriend, Vitige, courtier of the King.\n\nVitige slips away from his sweetheart Teodata's bedroom as dawn breaks. The two take a tender farewell of each other.\n\nGuido and Emilia are married in a ceremony with their immediate families present. The newly married couple sing of their happiness and look forward to the wedding party that evening.\n\nUgone presents his daughter Teodata to the King. Flavio is greatly struck by her beauty and suggests she become lady-in-waiting to the Queen (who does not appear in the opera). King Flavio receives word that his governor in Britain has become incapacitated through illness and needs to be replaced. The King offers the position to his counsellor Lotario, but changes his mind and offers the job to Ugone instead, thinking that with her father out of the way, he will more easily be able to seduce his lovely daughter Teodata. Lotario is furious that the King has backtracked on the prime position he was offered.\n\nFlavio praises the beauty of Teodata to his courtier Vitige, whom the King does not realise is Teodata's secret lover. Vitige tries to play down her attraction, telling the King that he doesn't think she is at all pleasing to look at. This produces no effect on the King's ardour, however.\n\nUgone tells his son Guido that he has been gravely insulted by Lotario, who has slapped him across the face. His honour demands that he fight a duel, but he is too old now, and demands that his son do so in his stead. Guido has to agree that his duty demands that he kill the father of his new bride. When Emilia meets up with Guido, he is too ashamed to look her in the eye.\nShe does not understand what is wrong, but declares she will always love him, no matter what.\n\nFlavio has ordered the lovely Teodata to come to him and is working on seducing her when her father bursts into the room, protesting about the loss of his honour. The King leaves Ugone with his daughter, who believes, mistakenly, that he must have discovered her clandestine relationship with Vitige and confesses all. This only makes Ugone bewail the loss of his family honour even more.\n\nLotario tells his daughter Emilia that her marriage to Guido is null and void and demands that she abandon him. She tells Guido what her father is asking her to do, but says she will never cease to love Guido. Guido is torn by his love for her and his duty to avenge the insult to his father.\n\nThe King orders his courtier Vitige to go to Teodata, tell her that the King loves her, and bring her to him. Vitige and Teodata decide the best strategy in this difficult situation will be for her not to reject the King but to play along with him.\n\nGuido challenges Lotario to a duel. The older man scornfully accepts, feeling that his greater experience will allow an easy victory, but is mortally wounded. The horrified Emilia finds her dying father in a pool of his own blood. He tells her Guido was responsible, and expires. Emilia vows to be revenged.\n\nEmilia and Ugone both go to the King, she demanding justice for her father's murder, he justifying his son's action by his vindication of the insult to him. Flavio says he will consider the matter; really he is more concerned at the moment with trying to seduce Teodata.\n\nVitige brings Teodata to the King and has to listen as Flavio declares she will be his real Queen, which makes him enraged with jealousy.\n\nEmilia confronts Guido, who gives her his sword and tells her to run him through. She takes the sword but is unable to kill him and leaves.\n\nVitige and Teodata have a quarrel about her treatment of the King as Flavio listens unobserved. She points out that Vitige told her to play along with Flavio, but Vitige says he did not mean that she should go that far. Flavio comes out of his hiding place, declares they have both deceived him and they will be punished.\n\nFlavio now realises that he will have to show wise judgement like a good King. He sends for Emilia and tells her that he has followed her desire; he has had Guido decapitated for killing her father and in fact she can see the severed head right away. Emilia swoons away and while she is unconscious the King has Guido come to her side so that when she revives they are joyously reunited.\n\nHe sends for Vitige and tells him that his punishment will be that he will have to marry the girl who he does not think is nice to look at, Teodata, and presents her to him.\n\nSo both pairs of lovers will marry, Ugone will go to Britain to take up his position as governor, and Flavio remain faithful to his wife.\n\nThe German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera \"Rinaldo\". A tremendous success, \"Rinaldo\" created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.\n\n\"Ottone\", an opera by Handel presented for the Academy in January 1723, was the first time London audiences had seen the operatic superstars, castrato Senesino and soprano Francesca Cuzzoni, performing together in an opera, and had been an immense success, with demand for tickets far outstripping supply\n\n\"Flavio\", following \"Ottone\" in the same year and with the same leading singers, did not create such a sensation as \"Ottone\" had, although it was successful enough with audiences to be revived by Handel in a subsequent season. One reason for this may have been \"Flavio\"'s comparative brevity, as announced in the playbills by the AcademyAt the King's Theatre...this present Tuesday...will be performed a New Opera call'd, FLAVIUS...By reason of the shortness of the Opera, to begin exactly at Eight a-Clock.\n\n\"Flavio\" also mixes high tragedy with amorous intrigue and comic interludes, which was perhaps not what London audiences, who had become accustomed to heroic dramas on a consistent note of serious drama in Italian opera, were expecting.\n\nThe work is lightly scored mostly for strings and continuo instruments only, with woodwinds being used sparingly. Handel's music treats some of the complications of the plot with mock-heroic irony, but the more serious passages produce intense dramatic music from the composer. 18th century musicologist Charles Burney praised the aria \" Amor, nel mio penar\" written for Senesino as Guido, torn between love and duty, as \"extremely pathetic\" and the aria for Emilia, \"Amante stravagante\" became a popular success as a separate song with English words fitted to it as \"See, see, my charmer flyes me\".\n\nDuring rehearsals for \"Flavio\", the tenor Alexander Gordon became frustrated with Handel's direction of the music from the harpsichord and threatened to jump on the instrument, to which Handel replied \"Oh! Let me know when you will do that and I will advertise it. For I am sure more people will come to see you jump than to hear you sing.\"\n\nAlthough a caricature, the contemporary engraving of Senesino on the left, Francesca Cuzzoni and castrato Gaetano Berenstadt on the right, provides valuable information about the visual aspect of the original performances of Handel operas. The illustration is probably of a scene from \"Flavio\". The elongated bodies of the castrati tower over Cuzzoni, who was described by Horace Walpole as \"short and squat\". The set is architectural and generic, not a specific locale, and the costumes for the men are also generic, with some inspiration from ancient Roman military attire, breastplates and leg armour, combined with plumes on the headdresses. Such costumes were worn by the leading men in Handel operas whether the setting was ancient Rome or Gothic Europe. Cuzzoni, in contrast, wears a contemporary gown such as might have been suitable for presentation at court, with a dwarf to serve as her train-bearer.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

It operated scheduled flights to destinations throughout Europe and Africa from its base at Brussels Airport. The airline operated from 2002 until 2017.\n\nThe airline was established on 12 December 2001 by the Thomas Cook Group to serve the Belgian holiday market, and started operations on 13 March 2002. Until January 2004, flight tickets could only be purchased via travel agencies as part of package tours; since then individual seat reservations are also possible.

Consequently, Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium was shut down by late October 2017 with two aircraft and all traffic rights being handed to Brussels Airlines. Its three remaining aircraft were to be relocated to Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium's sister companies.

The studio also urged Tiomkin to come up with a theme song for the film, to be released to radio and as a vinyl record. Tiomkin formed the basic melody to the song and enlisted songwriter Ned Washington to write the song's lyrics. What resulted was a gentle ballad. Warner Bros. presented the song to Les Baxter and his orchestra, who recorded and released the song to coincide with the release of the film. When released in 1954, \"The High and the Mighty\" peaked at #4 on the \"Billboard\" Pop chart. \n\nBoth the film score and the song were nominated for Academy Awards in 1955. The song, which ultimately did not win an award, was sung by Johnny Desmond, accompanied by Muzzy Marcellino at the Awards Television show. Dimitri Tiomkin's score won the Academy Award that year.\n\nToward the end of the film, after John Wayne's character convinced the captain to try to make it to San Francisco rather than ditch, the captain said \"Whistle me a tune, Dan. I like music when I work.\" Dan (John Wayne) whistled a bit of \"I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech\" (Georgia Tech's famous and catchy fight song). Audiences at the time no doubt immediately recognized it and understood it was a sign of success, as Georgia Tech was in its glory years in football under Bobby Dodd, during which it won six bowl games in six years and was named National Champion by one organization in 1952.\n\nA second and much rarer version of the title song lyrics also exists. In contrast to the romantic motif of the popular hit tune, the secondary version is instead a paean to the crews who guide the airliners through the night skies towards distant cities, and concludes with an allusion to the \"high and mighty\" as the Deity. \n\nAn instrumental version was also recorded in 1954 by the conductor and arranger LeRoy Holmes, reaching #9 on the \"Billboard\" chart. It became Holmes' biggest hit, and his most recognizable. The song is known for its distinctive whistling, which accompanies the music, and which was provided by Fred Lowery. (The whistling within the film itself was dubbed by Muzzy Marcellino.) Yet another hit version was recorded by Victor Young and his orchestra in 1954, peaking at #6 on the \"Billboard\" chart, and Harry James recorded a version in 1955 on his album \"Jukebox Jamboree\" (Columbia CL 615). Another version, complete with footsteps walking, and whistling, was recorded in the UK by Jimmy Young, with Bob Sharples & His Orchestra, on Decca label.\n\nAnother vocal version with the complete Ned Washington lyrics has been recorded by Billy Eckstine in his album \"12 Great Songs from the movies\" from the early 1960s. An instrumental version by George Greeley was recorded on his 1959 Warner Bros. album, \"Greatest Motion Picture Piano Concertos.\"\n\nThe tune is whistled in the fadeout of the Simon & Garfunkel song \"Punky's Dilemma\", from their 1968 album \"Bookends\". Toward the end of the 1980 film \"Seems Like Old Times\", Chevy Chase's character can be heard whistling the tune as he walks away from the camera.\n"}

He played 86 matches for the Denmark national football team in the course of 15 years, playing four international tournaments with the team, which he captained in his last two years before he retired in 2003.\n\nBorn in Tårnby, he started playing for his hometown club Tårnby Boldklub. He had a short spell in the youth team of Københavns boldklub (KB) alongside future national team player Michael Laudrup, but Heintze quickly moved on to play for the senior side of Kastrup Boldklub in January 1981, then in the top-flight Danish 1st Division. However, the team was relegated, and though he had offers from foreign clubs, the 17-year-old Heintze stayed at Kastrup, on orders of his mother.\n\nHe was bought by PSV in 1982 as a left winger, in which position he had been most successful in his first years at Kastrup Boldklub. Once at PSV, he was re-schooled as a defender, using his aggressiveness to charge up and down the sideline, and following a first season of few matches, he commanded the left back position in his second year, and made it his own. He won six Dutch Eredivisie league titles and a European Cup with the club, which at times counted three other Danes, Frank Arnesen, Søren Lerby and Ivan Nielsen, before the club hired coach Aad de Mos, who did not want him in the team. Heintze went to Germany to play for Bundesliga relegation battlers Bayer Uerdingen in 1994, and when the team was relegated in 1996, he went on to Bayer Leverkusen under coach Christoph Daum, with whom he finished in the Bundesliga top-three for three years in a row. Heintze returned to finish his career at PSV in 1999, with his old team mate Eric Gerets the head coach. Approaching 40, Heintze was looking to help the young Wilfred Bouma into the team as new left back, while using his experience to provide stability in the defense. He won another three Dutch championship titles before retiring in 2003.\n\nHeintze made his Denmark debut on 29 April 1987 in a Euro 1988 qualifying match, a 1–0 win over Finland, and he played all three matches at the final Euro 1988 tournament, though Denmark lost them all. At the final qualification match for the Euro 1992 against Yugoslavia on 1 May 1991, Heintze's then club, PSV, wanted him to stay home to play an important match for PSV, but he decided to travel with the Denmark team. Once at the Denmark camp, Heintze learned that national coach Richard Møller Nielsen did not intend to start with him in the game, and after consulting PSV, who still wanted him to play, Heintze decided to go back to the Netherlands, without the knowledge of Møller Nielsen. Back in Eindhoven, Heintze found out he wasn't eligible for the PSV match since he had been written off to play for Denmark. Heintze would see the PSV game from the sideline, and as a punishment for leaving the national team, he received a one-year ban from the national team by Møller Nielsen. As the ban expired before the Euro 1992, Heintze was once more called up, but an injury kept him from re-entering the team. Thus, he missed Denmark's later victory in Euro 1992, following Yugoslavia's exclusion from the tournament due to the Yugoslav wars. He played a further four matches under Møller Nielsen, before his national team career went on hiatus.\n\nWhen Denmark hired new coach Bo Johansson in 1996, Heintze was once more called up for Denmark, and he played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2000 tournaments. Following the international retirement of Peter Schmeichel in April 2001, Heintze captained his country at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, under new Denmark coach Morten Olsen. At the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, Heintze was suffering in the heat, and after being substituted after the second match of the tournament, Heintze watched the last two games from the bench, before Denmark was eliminated. He ended his national career following the competition, 38 years of age, though he continued to play another season for PSV.\n\nIn a Euro 2000 qualifying match against Belarus on 5 June 1999 he scored a memorable goal, directly from a corner kick.\n\nJan Heintze lived in the Netherlands, in Nuenen.\n\nPSV Eindhoven\n\n\n"}

The carrying charge includes insurance, storage and interest on the invested funds as well as other incidental costs. In interest rate futures markets, it refers to the differential between the yield on a cash instrument and the cost of the funds necessary to buy the instrument.\n\nIf long, the cost of carry is the cost of interest paid on a margin account. Conversely, if short, the cost of carry is the cost of paying dividends, or rather the opportunity cost; the cost of purchasing a particular security rather than an alternative. For most investments, the cost of carry generally refers to the risk-free interest rate that could be earned by investing currency in a theoretically safe investment vehicle such as a money market account minus any future cash flows that are expected from holding an equivalent instrument with the same risk (generally expressed in percentage terms and called the convenience yield). Storage costs (generally expressed as a percentage of the spot price) should be added to the cost of carry for physical commodities such as corn, wheat, or gold.\n\nThe cost of carry model expresses the forward price (or, as an approximation, the futures price) as a function of the spot price and the cost of carry.\n\nwhere\n\nThe same model in currency markets is known as interest rate parity.\n\nFor example, a US investor buying a Standard and Poor's 500 e-mini futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could expect the cost of carry to be the prevailing risk-free interest rate (around 5% as of November, 2007) minus the expected dividends that one could earn from buying each of the stocks in the S&P 500 and receiving any dividends that they might pay, since the e-mini futures contract is a proxy for the underlying stocks in the S&P 500. Since the contract is a futures contract and settles at some forward date, the actual values of the dividends may not yet be known so the cost of carry must be estimated.\n\n"}

It is a kind of internal antenna. They are mostly used at microwave frequencies. An individual microstrip antenna consists of a patch of metal foil of various shapes (a patch antenna) on the surface of a PCB (printed circuit board), with a metal foil ground plane on the other side of the board. Most microstrip antennas consist of multiple patches in a two-dimensional array. The antenna is usually connected to the transmitter or receiver through foil microstrip transmission lines. The radio frequency current is applied (or in receiving antennas the received signal is produced) between the antenna and ground plane. Microstrip antennas have become very popular in recent decades due to their thin planar profile which can be incorporated into the surfaces of consumer products, aircraft and missiles; their ease of fabrication using printed circuit techniques; the ease of integrating the antenna on the same board with the rest of the circuit, and the possibility of adding active devices such as microwave integrated circuits to the antenna itself to make active antennas \n\nThe most common type of microstrip antenna is the patch antenna. Antennas using patches as constitutive elements in an array are also possible. A patch antenna is a narrowband, wide-beam antenna fabricated by etching the antenna element pattern in metal trace bonded to an insulating dielectric substrate, such as a printed circuit board, with a continuous metal layer bonded to the opposite side of the substrate which forms a ground plane. Common microstrip antenna shapes are square, rectangular, circular and elliptical, but any continuous shape is possible. Some patch antennas do not use a dielectric substrate and instead are made of a metal patch mounted above a ground plane using dielectric spacers; the resulting structure is less rugged but has a wider bandwidth. Because such antennas have a very low profile, are mechanically rugged and can be shaped to conform to the curving skin of a vehicle, they are often mounted on the exterior of aircraft and spacecraft, or are incorporated into mobile radio communications devices.\n\nMicrostrip antennas are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and design because of the simple 2-dimensional physical geometry. They are usually employed at UHF and higher frequencies because the size of the antenna is directly tied to the wavelength at the resonant frequency. A single patch antenna provides a maximum directive gain of around 6-9 dBi. It is relatively easy to print an array of patches on a single (large) substrate using lithographic techniques. Patch arrays can provide much higher gains than a single patch at little additional cost; matching and phase adjustment can be performed with printed microstrip feed structures, again in the same operations that form the radiating patches. The ability to create high gain arrays in a low-profile antenna is one reason that patch arrays are common on airplanes and in other military applications.\n\nSuch an array of patch antennas is an easy way to make a phased array of antennas with dynamic beamforming ability.\n\nAn advantage inherent to patch antennas is the ability to have polarization diversity. Patch antennas can easily be designed to have vertical, horizontal, right hand circular (RHCP) or left hand circular (LHCP) polarizations, using multiple feed points, or a single feedpoint with asymmetric patch structures. This unique property allows patch antennas to be used in many types of communications links that may have varied requirements.\n\nThe most commonly employed microstrip antenna is a rectangular patch which looks like a truncated microstrip transmission line. It is approximately of one-half wavelength long. When air is used as the dielectric substrate, the length of the rectangular microstrip antenna is approximately one-half of a free-space wavelength. As the antenna is loaded with a dielectric as its substrate, the length of the antenna decreases as the relative dielectric constant of the substrate increases. The resonant length of the antenna is slightly shorter because of the extended electric \"fringing fields\" which increase the electrical length of the antenna slightly. An early model of the microstrip antenna is a section of microstrip transmission line with equivalent loads on either end to represent the radiation loss.\n\nThe dielectric loading of a microstrip antenna affects both its radiation pattern and impedance bandwidth. As the dielectric constant of the substrate increases, the antenna bandwidth decreases which increases the Q factor of the antenna and therefore decreases the impedance bandwidth. This relationship did not immediately follow when using the transmission line model of the antenna, but is apparent when using the cavity model which was introduced in the late 1970s by Lo et al. The radiation from a rectangular microstrip antenna may be understood as a pair of equivalent slots. These slots act as an array and have the highest directivity when the antenna has an air dielectric and decreases as the antenna is loaded by material with increasing relative dielectric constant.\n\nThe half-wave rectangular microstrip antenna has a virtual shorting plane along its center. This may be replaced with a physical shorting plane to create a quarter-wavelength microstrip antenna. This is sometimes called a half-patch. The antenna only has a single radiation edge (equivalent slot) which lowers the directivity/gain of the antenna. The impedance bandwidth is slightly lower than a half-wavelength full patch as the coupling between radiating edges has been eliminated.\n\nAnother type of patch antenna is the planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA).\nThe PIFA is common in cellular phones (mobile phones) with built-in antennas.\nThe antenna is resonant at a quarter-wavelength (thus reducing the required space needed on the phone), and also typically has good SAR properties.\nThis antenna resembles an inverted F, which explains the PIFA name. The PIFA is popular because it has a low profile and an omnidirectional pattern.\nThese antennas are derived from a quarter-wave half-patch antenna. The shorting plane of the half-patch is reduced in length which decreases the resonance frequency.\nOften PIFA antennas have multiple branches to resonate at the various cellular bands. On some phones, grounded parasitic elements are used to enhance the radiation bandwidth characteristics. \n\nThe folded inverted conformal antenna (FICA) has some advantages with respect to the PIFA, because it allows a better volume reuse.\n\n"}

It was originally built as the Third Judicial District Courthouse from 1874 to 1877, and was designed by architect Frederick Clarke Withers of the firm of Vaux and Withers.\n\nThough faced with demolition in 1958, public outcry led to its reuse as a branch of the New York Public Library. The building is now part of the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission's Greenwich Village Historic District, created in 1969. In addition, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and made a National Historic Landmark in 1977. The \"AIA Guide to New York City\" calls the building \"A mock Neuschwansteinian assemblage ... of leaded glass, steeply sloping roofs, gables, pinnacles, Venetian Gothic embellishments, and an intricate tower and clock; one of the City's most remarkable buildings.\"\n\nA tall octagonal wooden fire lookout tower was the first building on the site, built circa 1833, located in the center of the merchants' sheds at the Jefferson Market that had been established at this site in 1832 and named for the late President. Court sessions were held in the Jefferson Assembly Rooms that rose above the market sheds. The wood tower and the market structures were torn down by the city to build a new courthouse, the adjacent Jefferson Market Prison building that stood on the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue and new coordinated market housing (built in 1883). Of the carefully massed eclectic and picturesque group, only the former Courthouse now remains.\n\nThe commission for the new courthouse went to the firm of Vaux and Withers, but as Calvert Vaux was busy with the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the design fell to his partner, the English-born Frederick Clarke Withers. Withers came from the same background as Vaux, so it is not unusual that his High Victorian Gothic design was similar in some respects to the \"Ruskinian Gothic\" aesthetic of Vaux's early buildings, such as in its polychrome materials – red brick, black stone, white granite, yellow sandstone trim and variegated roof slates. Reasoning that a building with a clock tower was going to look like a church no matter what he did, Withers decided to add church-like touches with non-religious content, such as the tympanum which shows a scene from \"The Merchant of Venice\" instead of the usual scene of Christ sitting in judgment or other ecclesiastical subject matter. The building also features stained glass windows and a fountain decorated with birds and animals.\n\nThe courthouse was completed in 1877, and in 1885 a panel of American architects sponsored by \"American Architect and Building News\" voted it the fifth most beautiful building in America.\n\nThe building got substantial use as a courthouse, as the Third Judicial District covered the Madison Square area, where the city's entertainment district – The Tenderloin – was located. So heavy was the traffic, that the country's first night court began there. Among the more noted people arraigned in the courthouse was Harry K. Thaw, the murderer of celebrity architect Stanford White.\n\nThe building ceased to be used as a courthouse in 1945; its future was uncertain, and it was in danger of being torn down. A group of community preservationists led by Margot Gayle and Ruth Wittenberg formed the Committee of Neighbors to Get the Clock on Jefferson Market Courthouse Started and campaigned to have the building converted into a library. In 1961, the New York Public Library agreed to the plan and architect Giorgio Cavaglieri was brought in to restore the exterior and redesign the building's interior for its new use – one of the first adaptive reuse projects in the United States, and a signal event in the historic preservation movement. The restoration is estimated to have cost $1.4 million. The library opened in 1967, with the police court becoming the Children's Reading Room, the Civil Court the Adult Reading Room. Budget cutbacks in 1974 caused the Board of Trustees of the New York Public Library to vote to close the branch, as well as two others. After an outcry from residents, the decision was rescinded one month later.\n\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977, both under the name \"Third Judicial District Courthouse\".\n\nThe building received further restoration in 1994 by preservationist architect Joseph Pell Lombardi.\n\nIn 1996 \"Ol' Jeff\", the fire bell, silent in the Tower for 135 years, regained its voice with Margot Gayle's help, thanks to Cynthia Crane and Marilyn Dorato. It strikes the hours from 9am to 10pm. On April 13, 1997, the \"New York Times\" wrote: \"The bell has newly and unexpectedly connected the community surrounding the building on Avenue of the Americas at 10th Street, helping to put the concept of village back in Greenwich Village; it serves as a powerful, an hourly, reminder of the values of architectural preservation.\"\n\nThere are annual tours of the tower, typically during Open House New York weekend in October.\n\nBy 2012 the building's exterior was once again in need of restoration, deteriorated ornaments were re-sculpted from the original Ohio sandstone. The tower's railings and finial were repaired and resecured. Missing and broken slates were replaced at the slate roof and a new copper drainage system installed. Brick and stone were re-pointed and cleaned. SUPERSTRUCTURES Engineers + Architects led the restoration. The owners and project team were honored by the New York Landmarks Conservancy with its Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award in 2014.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

{"id": "2021958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021958", "title": "Tailpiece", "text": "Tailpiece\n\nA tailpiece is a component on many stringed musical instruments that anchors one end of the strings, usually opposite the end with the tuning mechanism (the scroll, headstock, peghead, etc.).\n\nThe tailpiece anchors the strings, so it must be strong enough to withstand their combined tension. Tailpieces of the violin family or viol families of instruments, including double basses, are attached by a \"tailgut\" looped around the tailpin or end button, which is let into the bottom bock of the instrument. Originally made of animal gut and adjusted with difficulty by means of a knot, tailguts are now usually made of wire or nylon monofilament, and easily adjusted with threaded collars, usually made of brass, on the ends.\n\nTailpieces are made of many materials. Violin tailpieces are typically made of wood: ebony, rosewood, boxwood, or rarely pernambuco. Other materials include cast light metal, and composites including plastic. Choice of material may have more than just cosmetic effect; a well-made instrument is sensitive to tailpiece weight, mass distribution, and tailgut placement on the saddle. Fretted string instrument tailpieces are typically made of metal. \n\nViolin tailpieces come in various shapes. Some resemble a tulip or a goblet. The common \"Hill style\" has a central longitudinal ridge that gives it a faceted appearance. Some violin tailpieces feature decorative elements, as shell inlays or ornate stylized or figurative carvings.\n\nDevices called \"fine-tuners\" are sometimes used to assist in the tuning of the instrument; they may either be affixed to the tailpiece or built into its design. Most modern violinists, regardless of what other strings they use, play an E with a solid steel core, which may be overly touchy to tune with the traditional tuning pegs. For convenience in tuning, the added mass of a single fine tuner is a tolerable trade-off. Four fine tuners are advantageous when tuning a set of metal-core strings.\n\nSome electric guitar tailpieces feature a \"vibrato bar\", which a player uses to alter the pitch of all strings at once for various musical effects.\n\nA well-set-up instrument from the violin family will have attention paid to the tuning of the afterlength, or string length on the tailpiece side of the bridge. On many instruments it is set to 1/6 the playing length, or length between nut and bridge, sounding two octaves and a fifth above the open note of the playing length. This tuning may be varied to give certain desired effects.\n\n"}

{"id": "2021968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021968", "title": "Computerized physician order entry", "text": "Computerized physician order entry\n\nComputerized physician order entry (CPOE), sometimes referred to as computerized provider order entry or computerized provider order management (CPOM), is a process of electronic entry of medical practitioner instructions for the treatment of patients (particularly hospitalized patients) under his or her care.\n\nThe entered orders are communicated over a computer network to the medical staff or to the departments (pharmacy, laboratory, or radiology) responsible for fulfilling the order. CPOE reduces the time it takes to distribute and complete orders, while increasing efficiency by reducing transcription errors including preventing duplicate order entry, while simplifying inventory management and billing. \n\nCPOE is a form of patient management software.\n\nIn a graphical representation of an order sequence, specific data should be presented to CPOE system staff in cleartext, including: \n\n\nSome textual data can be reduced to simple graphics.\n\nCPOE systems use terminology familiar to medical and nursing staff, but there are different terms used to classify and concatenate orders. The following items are examples of additional terminology that a CPOE system programmer might need to know:\n\nThe application responding to, \"i.e.\", performing, a request for services (orders) or producing an observation. The filler can also originate requests for services (new orders), add additional services to existing orders, replace existing orders, put an order on hold, discontinue an order, release a held order, or cancel existing orders.\n\nA request for a service from one application to a second application. In some cases an application is allowed to place orders with itself.\n\nOne of several segments that can carry order information. Future ancillary specific segments may be defined in subsequent releases of the Standard if they become necessary.\n\nThe application or individual originating a request for services (order).\n\nA list of associated orders coming from a single location regarding a single patient.\n\nA grouping of orders used to standardize and expedite the ordering process for a common clinical scenario. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a licensed physician.)\n\nA grouping of orders used to standardize and automate a clinical process on behalf of a physician. (Typically, these orders are started, modified, and stopped by a nurse, pharmacist, or other licensed health professional.)\n\nFeatures of the ideal computerized physician order entry system (CPOE) include:\n\nIn the past, physicians have traditionally hand-written or verbally communicated orders for patient care, which are then transcribed by various individuals (such as unit clerks, nurses, and ancillary staff) before being carried out. Handwritten reports or notes, manual order entry, non-standard abbreviations and poor legibility lead to errors and injuries to patients, . A follow up IOM report in 2001 advised use of electronic medication ordering, with computer- and internet-based information systems to support clinical decisions. Prescribing errors are the largest identified source of preventable hospital medical error. A 2006 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that a hospitalized patient is exposed to a medication error each day of his or her stay. While further studies have estimated that CPOE implementation at all nonrural hospitals in the United States could prevent over 500,000 serious medication errors each year. Studies of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) has yielded evidence that suggests the medication error rate can be reduced by 80%, and errors that have potential for serious harm or death for patients can be reduced by 55%, and other studies have also suggested benefits. Further, in 2005, CMS and CDC released a report that showed only 41 percent of prophylactic antibacterials were correctly stopped within 24 hours of completed surgery. The researchers conducted an analysis over an eight-month period, implementing a CPOE system designed to stop the administration of prophylactic antibacterials. Results showed CPOE significantly improved timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8 percent of surgeries to 55.7 percent in the intervention hospital. CPOE/e-Prescribing systems can provide automatic dosing alerts (for example, letting the user know that the dose is too high and thus dangerous) and interaction checking (for example, telling the user that 2 medicines ordered taken together can cause health problems). In this way, specialists in pharmacy informatics work with the medical and nursing staffs at hospitals to improve the safety and effectiveness of medication use by utilizing CPOE systems.\n\nGenerally, CPOE is advantageous, as it leaves the trails of just better formatting retrospective information, similarly to traditional hospital information systems designs. The key advantage of providing information from the physician in charge of treatment for a single patient to the different roles involved in processing he treatise itself is widely innovative. This makes CPOE the primary tool for information transfer to the performing staff and lesser the tool for collecting action items for the accounting staff. However, the needs of proper accounting get served automatically upon feedback on completion of orders.\n\nCPOE is generally not suitable without reasonable training and tutoring respectively. As with other technical means, the system based communicating of information may be inaccessible or inoperable due to failures. That is not different to making use of an ordinary telephone or with conventional hospital information systems. Beyond, the information conveyed may be faulty or erratic. A concatenated validating of orders must be well organized. Errors lead to liability cases as with all professional treatment of patients.\n\nPrescriber and staff inexperience may cause slower entry of orders at first, use more staff time, and is slower than person-to-person communication in an emergency situation. Physician to nurse communication can worsen if each group works alone at their workstations.\n\nBut, in general, the options to reuse order sets anew with new patients lays the basic for substantial enhancement of the processing of services to the patients in the complex distribution of work amongst the roles involved. The basic concepts are defined with the clinical pathway approach. However, success does not occur by itself. The preparatory work has to be budgeted from the very beginning and has to be maintained all the time. Patterns of proper management from other service industry and from production industry may apply. However, the medical methodologies and nursing procedures do not get affected by the management approaches.\n\nCPOE presents several possible dangers by introducing new types of errors. Automation causes a false sense of security, a misconception that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided. These factors contributed to an \"increased\" mortality rate in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh's Pediatric ICU when a CPOE systems was introduced. In other settings, shortcut or default selections can override non-standard medication regimens for elderly or underweight patients, resulting in toxic doses. Frequent alerts and warnings can interrupt work flow, causing these messages to be ignored or overridden due to alert fatigue. CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the United States Pharmacopoeia. Introducing CPOE to a complex medical environment requires ongoing changes in design to cope with unique patients and care settings, close supervision of overrides caused by automatic systems, and training, testing and re-training all users.\n\nCPOE systems can take years to install and configure. Despite ample evidence of the potential to reduce medication errors, adoption of this technology by doctors and hospitals in the United States has been slowed by resistance to changes in physician's practice patterns, costs and training time involved, and concern with interoperability and compliance with future national standards. According to a study by RAND Health, the US healthcare system could save more than 81 billion dollars annually, reduce adverse medical events and improve the quality of care if it were to widely adopt CPOE and other health information technology. As more hospitals become aware of the financial benefits of CPOE, and more physicians with a familiarity with computers enter practice, increased use of CPOE is predicted. Several high-profile failures of CPOE implementation have occurred, so a major effort must be focused on change management, including restructuring workflows, dealing with physicians' resistance to change, and creating a collaborative environment.\n\nAn early success with CPOE by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture or VistA. A graphical user interface known as the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) allows health care providers to review and update a patient's record at any computer in the VA's over 1,000 healthcare facilities. CPRS includes the ability to place orders by CPOE, including medications, special procedures, x-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets and laboratory tests.\n\nThe world's first successful implementation of a CPOE system was at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, California in the early 1970s. The Medical Information System (MIS) was originally developed by a software and hardware team at Lockheed in Sunnyvale, California, which became the TMIS group at Technicon Instruments Corporation. The MIS system used a light pen to allow physicians and nurses to quickly point and click items to be ordered.\n\n, one of the largest projects for a national EHR is by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. The goal of the NHS is to have 60,000,000 patients with a centralized electronic health record by 2010. The plan involves a gradual roll-out commencing May 2006, providing general practices in England access to the National Programme for IT (NPfIT). The NHS component, known as the \"Connecting for Health Programme\", includes office-based CPOE for medication prescribing and test ordering and retrieval, although some concerns have been raised about patient safety features.\n\nIn 2008, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and the New England Healthcare Institute (NEHI) published research showing that 1 in 10 patients admitted to a Massachusetts community hospital suffered a preventable medication error. The study argued that Massachusetts hospitals could prevent 55,000 adverse drug events per year and save $170 million annually if they fully implemented CPOE. The findings prompted the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to enact legislation requiring all hospitals to implement CPOE by 2012 as a condition of licensure.\n\nIn addition, the study also concludes that it would cost approximately $2.1 million to implement a CPOE system, and a cost of $435,000 to maintain it in the state of Massachusetts while it saves annually about $2.7 million per hospital. The hospitals will still see payback within 26 months through reducing hospitalizations generated by error. Despite the advantages and cost savings, the CPOE is still not well adapted by many hospitals in the US.\n\nThe Leapfrog’s 2008 Survey showed that most hospitals are still not complying with having a fully implemented, effective CPOE system. The CPOE requirement became more challenging to meet in 2008 because the Leapfrog introduced a new requirement: Hospitals must test their CPOE systems with Leapfrog’s CPOE Evaluation Tool. So the number of hospitals in the survey considered to be fully meeting the standard dropped to 7% in 2008 from 11% the previous year. Though the adoption rate seems very low in 2008, it is still an improvement from 2002 when only 2% of hospitals met this Leapfrog standard.\n\n\n"}

He is the brother of Pat Sanderson who also played rugby for Littleborough RUFC.\n\nHis rugby career blossomed under coach Brian Gornall at Kirkham Grammar School. His first Sale coach, John Mitchell, also had a great influence on him as did Steve Diamond and Jim Mallinder, both of whom he played alongside when he broke into the first team.\n\nHe scored a try on his England debut after coming on as a replacement against Romania in November 2001, having captained the England midweek side in North America soon after being selected for the England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham. He made his Six Nations debut as a replacement against Italy in March 2003 and was part of the wider 43-man squad for the World Cup, playing in the pre-World Cup warm-up matches against Wales and France in Marseille.\n\nHe was forced to retire from rugby in 2005 due to a back injury.\n\n"}

Selex S&AS became SELEX Galileo in 2008 and from January 2013 (following a merger with other Finmeccanica companies SELEX Sistemi Integrati and Selex Elsag) traded as Selex ES. It then merged into Leonardo S.p.A.'s land and naval defence electronics division on 1 January 2016.\n\nThe business had its UK headquarters in Basildon, Essex, England.\n\nBAE Systems Avionics has a rich heritage which dates back to 1909 when the Elliott and Marconi companies began to fit aircraft with systems (beginning with embryonic air to ground communications). By 1913 Elliot's avionics product lines advanced to gyroscopes, weapon sights and altimeters.\n\n\n"}

It is notable as the only complete Esperantido (offspring of Esperanto) created by the original creator of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof. Although Zamenhof's stated preference was to avoid any discussion of changes, he was put under considerable pressure, including financial, to respond to the diverse reforms proposed by others. Reluctantly he decided to present a reformed dialect himself and undertook to continue guiding the community, whether or not reforms were eventually agreed upon.\n\nAlthough Zamenhof initially called his reform a systematic attempt to re-create the language in the light of more than six years of practical experience, scarcely any of the Esperanto community of the time accepted it as a whole. The majority voted to reject all changes. Zamenhof himself later rejected the whole project and referred to 1894 as 'a wasted year'. In 1907 he expressly refused permission to anyone wishing to re-publish the proposed reforms. In 1929 Johannes Dietterle cited this refusal as justification for omitting details of the reform project from his collection of Zamenhof's complete works, \"Originala Verkaro\".\n\nSome of the proposed reforms from 1894 such as replacing the -oj plural with -i, the removal of the diacritics and adjectival agreement were used in the language reform project Ido beginning in 1907, but these were not accepted by the Esperanto community either and Esperanto has changed relatively little since the publication of Zamenhof's \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" in 1905.\n\n\nThe Lord's Prayer in several Reformed versions and standard Esperanto for comparison:\n\n"}
