In 1855 he was elected a full member of the Royal Academy, to which he later gave in trust £15,000 to provide annuities for superannuated artists. One of the most important figures in the history of British engraving, he died in London, unmarried, in 1887.\n\nCousins was preeminently the interpreter of Sir Thomas Lawrence, his contemporary. During his apprenticeship to Samuel William Reynolds he engraved many of the best amongst the three hundred and sixty little mezzotints illustrating the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds which his master issued in his own name. In the finest of his numerous transcripts of Lawrence, such as \"Lady Acland and her Sons\", \"Pope Pius VII\" and \"Master Lambton\", the distinguishing characteristics of the engravers work, brilliancy and force of effect in a high key, corresponded exactly with similar qualities in the painter.\n\nAfter the introduction of steel for engraving purposes about the year 1823, Cousins and his contemporaries were compelled to work on it, because the soft copper previously used for mezzotint plates did not yield a sufficient number of fine impressions to enable the method to compete commercially against line engraving, from which much larger editions were obtainable. The painterly quality which distinguished the 18th-century mezzotints on copper was wanting in his later works, because the hardness of the steel on which they were engraved impaired freedom of execution and richness of tone, and so enhanced the labor of scraping that he accelerated the work by stipple, etching the details instead of scraping them out of the ground in the manner of his predecessors. To this mixed style, previously used by Richard Earlom on copper, Cousins added heavy roulette and rocking-tool textures, tending to fortify the darks, when he found that the burr even on steel failed to yield enough fine impressions to meet high demand. The effect of his prints in this method after Reynolds and Millais was mechanical and out of harmony with the picturesque technique of these painters, but the phenomenal popularity which Cousins gained for his works at least kept alive and in favor a form of mezzotint engraving during a critical phase of its history. Abraham Raimbach, the line engraver, dated the decline of his own art in England from the appearance in 1837 of Cousins's print (in the mixed style) after Landseer's \"Bolton Abbey\". Such plates as \"Miss Peel\", after Lawrence (published in 1833);\" A Midsummer Nights Dream\", after Landseer (1857); \"The Order of Release\" and \"The First Minuet\", after Millais (1856 and 1868); \"The Strawberry Girl\" and \"Lavinia, Countess Spencer\", after Reynolds; and \"Miss Rich\", after Hogarth (1873-1877), represent various stages of Cousins's mixed method. It reached its final development in the plates after Millais's \"Cherry Ripe\" and \"Pomona\", published in 1881 and 1882, when the invention of facing copper-plates with a film of steel to make them yield larger editions led to the revival of pure mezzotint on copper, which rendered obsolete the steel plate and the mixed style which it fostered. The fine draughtsmanship of Cousins was as apparent in his prints as in his original lead-pencil portraits exhibited in London in 1882.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1990656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990656", "title": "Cystectomy", "text": "Cystectomy\n\nCystectomy is a medical term for surgical removal of all or part of the urinary bladder. It may also be rarely used to refer to the removal of a cyst. The most common condition warranting removal of the urinary bladder is bladder cancer.\n\nTwo main types of cystectomies can be performed. A partial cystectomy (also known as a segmental cystectomy) involves removal of only a portion of the bladder. A radical cystectomy involves removal of the entire bladder along with surrounding lymph nodes and other nearby organs that contain cancer.\n\nEvaluation of the tissue removed during cystectomy and lymph node dissection aids in determining pathological cancer staging. This type of cancer staging can be used to determine further work-up, treatment, and follow-up needed along with potential prognosis.\n\nAfter the bladder has been removed, a urinary diversion is necessary to allow elimination of urine.\n\nRadical cystectomy is the recommended treatment for bladder cancer that has invaded the muscle of the bladder. Cystectomy may also be recommended for individuals with a high risk of cancer progression or failure of the cancer to respond to less invasive treatments.\n\nWhen determining the type of cystectomy to be performed many factors are taken into consideration. Some of these factors include: age, overall health, baseline bladder function, type of cancer, location and size of the cancer, and stage of the cancer.\n\nA partial cystectomy involves removal of only a portion of the bladder and is performed for some benign and malignant tumors localized to the bladder. Individuals that may be candidates for partial cystectomy include those with single tumors located near the dome, or top, of the bladder, tumors that do not invade the muscle of the bladder, tumors located within bladder diverticulum, or cancer that is not carcinoma in situ (CIS). A partial cystectomy may also be performed for removal of tumors which have originated and spread from neighboring organs such as the colon.\n\nA radical cystectomy is most commonly performed for cancer that has invaded into the muscle of the bladder. In a radical cystectomy the bladder is removed along with surrounding lymph nodes (lymph node dissection) and other organs that contain cancer. In men, this could include the prostate and seminal vesicles. In women, this could include a portion of the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries.\n\nIn an open radical cystectomy a large incision is made in the middle of the abdomen from just above or next to the umbilicus to the pubic symphysis. The following information provides general steps to the procedure and may occur in varying order depending on the surgeon. The ureters are located and cut free from the bladder. The bladder is separated from surrounding structures and removed. The urethra, which drains urine from the bladder, may also be removed depending on tumor involvement. In men, the prostate may or may not be removed during this procedure. Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is performed. A urinary diversion is then created and the free ends of the ureters are reconnected to the diversion.\n\nA minimally invasive radical cystectomy more commonly known as a robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RARC) may be an option for individuals depending on several factors including but not limited to: their overall health (with special attention to their lung health), body mass index (BMI), number and types of previous surgeries, along with the location and size of the bladder cancer. In a RARC several small incisions are made across the abdomen to allow placement of surgical instruments. These instruments are then connect to a surgical robot that is controlled by the surgeon. A head down (Trendelenburg) position is used and the abdomen is inflated with gas (insufflation) to allow better operating space and visualization. The remainder of the procedure is carried out in a fashion similar to the open procedure.\n\nGenerally, there are no specific contraindications to having a cystectomy. However, cystectomy should not be performed in individuals who are not healthy enough to undergo a major surgical procedure. This includes individuals who cannot tolerate general anesthesia or those with severe or inadequately managed co-morbidities such as diabetes, heart, lung, kidney, or liver disease. This also includes individuals who are severely malnourished, have problems with blood clotting, or severe laboratory abnormalities. Also, individuals with an active illness or infection should delay surgery until recovery.\n\nRobotic-assisted or laparoscopic surgery is contraindicated for individuals with severe heart and lung disease. During this method of surgery the positioning and abdominal insufflation places extra strain on the chest wall impairing lung function and the ability to oxygenate the blood.\n\nA partial cystectomy is contraindicated in a form of bladder cancer called carcinoma in situ (CIS). Other contraindications for partial cystectomy include severely diminished bladder capacity or cancer in very close proximity to the bladder trigone, where the urethra and ureters connect to the bladder.\n\nRadical cystectomy with the creation of a urinary diversion can be associated with several risks and complications due to the extent and complexity of the surgery. As with most major surgeries there is risk from anesthesia, also, risk of bleeding, blood clots, heart attack, stroke, and pneumonia or other respiratory problems. There is also a risk of infection involving the urinary tract, abdomen, and gastrointestinal tract. After the surgical incisions are closed there is a risk of infection at these sites.\n\nComplications are similar between open and minimally invasive cystectomy techniques and include the following:\n\nAn ileus, where movement within the intestines slows down is the most common complication following cystectomy. This is due to a variety of factors including manipulation of the intestines due to their proximity of the bladder, the actual operation on the intestines to create a urinary diversion, or even certain medications such as narcotics. In addition to slowing of the small intestine, the small intestine can also become obstructed. After creation of a urinary diversion, intestinal contents can leak at the site where the intestine are reconnected.\n\nWith creation of a urinary diversion it is possible for the ureters to become obstructed preventing the drainage of urine from the kidneys. If this occurs, another procedure to insert a percuntaneous nephrostomy tube may be need to allow drainage of urine from the body. Obstruction of the ureter most commonly occurs at the site where the ureters are reconnected to the urinary diversion created. A small, hollow, flexible tube called a stent may be placed inside the ureter at the time of surgery to possibly help the reconnection site to heal. This reconnection site is also at risk for leaking urine within the abdomen.\n\nIf a partial cystectomy is performed, damage to the ureter may occur depending of the location of the tumor removed. This may require an additional procedure to repair.\n\nDue to the location of the operation, damage to nerves in the pelvis can occur during removal of the bladder or lymph nodes. Nerves in this area are responsible for movement and sensation of the legs and include the obturator nerve, the genitofemoral nerve, and the femoral nerve.\n\nAny of these complications may require another operation or re-admission to the hospital.\n\nImmediately after surgery no food or drink is allowed due to involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in the surgery. The diet will then be slowly advanced to liquids and then solid foods as tolerated. If gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal bloating occur the diet may be stopped or advancement of the diet slowed down depending on the severity.\n\nIntravenous pain medication such as narcotics are typically used immediately after surgery. Pain medications can be switched to an oral form once a diet is tolerated.\n\nEarly activity is encouraged after surgery. Individuals may be able to walk and sit in a chair as early as the same day of surgery. Usually individuals are able to walk around their room or hospital ward within a day or two after surgery. Some individuals may require additional assistance or physical therapy in the hospital or once discharged home.\n\nApproaches to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) are performed both before and after surgery. Compression devices placed around the legs or medications such as Heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are commonly used. VTE prophylaxis with LMWH may even be continued after hospital discharge in needed.\n\nIf an open cystectomy was performed, the staples closing the incision are usually removed 5 to 10 days after surgery. Further follow-up with the surgeon is typically scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after surgery and may involve laboratory or imaging studies to assess recovery along with further care and follow-up.\n"}

He is known for his productions of William Shakespeare's plays which were faithful to their original versions, after the derived works by Nahum Tate, Colley Cibber and David Garrick had dominated the stage for over a century.\n\nPhelps made his \"début\" as Shylock in London at the Haymarket Theatre in 1837 and appeared under the management of William Charles Macready at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, who recognized Phelps as a potential rival and gave him little opportunity to display his talents, although Phelps did gain popularity in the roles of Captain Channel in Douglas William Jerrold's melodrama \"The Prisoner of War\" (1842), and of Lord Tresham in Robert Browning's \"A Blot in the 'Scutcheon\" (1843).\n\nIt was not until the abolition of the Patent monopoly on theatrical production that Phelps was able to take over the management of the then-unfashionable Sadler's Wells Theatre and revolutionize the production of Shakespeare's plays by restoring Shakespearean performances to the original text of the first folio and away from the adaptations by Colley Cibber, Nahum Tate and David Garrick that had been favored by the theatre-going public since the Restoration. Phelps staged all but four of Shakespeare's plays at Sadler's Wells, some of which (like \"The Winter's Tale\" and \"Measure for Measure\") hadn't been performed since their premieres at the Globe Theatre.\nPhelps' most frequently performed role was Hamlet, but he counted Macbeth, Wolsey, Leontes, and Bottom among his greatest achievements. He was generally considered the finest King Lear of his generation, returning to Shakespeare's version, which had been replaced on stage for over a hundred and fifty years by Tate's happy ending adaptation \"The History of King Lear\", and staging the first production of the original version since the Restoration in 1845. \"Bell's Weekly Messenger\" wrote \"The majesty, as well as the paternal tenderness of Lear, is preserved throughout; the grief, despair, and madness are kingly; and the business which the action inspires is heightened by the consciousness of the greatness of the mind that is suffering.\"\n\nPhelps other great creation was his Falstaff, which the German publication \"Gesammelte Werke\" called his finest role. He first played Shakespeare's fat knight in \"Henry IV, Part I\" in 1846. While not suited for the sensuality typically associated with the role, Phelps relied on his intelligence and aristocratic suaveness in his interpretation which he altered slightly in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\" portraying a gentlemanly knight who observed the standards of decorum regardless of the vulgarity of his current surroundings. His production of \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\", the first regular revival of that play since the seventeenth century, emphasized spectacle in a way that set the pattern for many future productions. In 1864, as part of the celebrations of Shakespeare's tricentennial, he played the title role in \"Cymbeline\" at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; Helen Faucit was Imogen.\n\nSadly, Phelps' skills declined in old age so that critics no longer cared for his work in tragic plays, approving only his performances in comic roles like Falstaff and Bottom. But in his prime, he was the most versatile actor of his generation. A definitive biography, \"Samuel Phelps & the Sadler's Wells Theatre\", was written by Shirley S. Allen in 1971.\n\n"}

He worked under Isambard Kingdom Brunel for more than twenty years and, following Brunel's death, completed many of his projects.\n\nRobert Pearson Brereton came from a Norfolk family that produced other notable Victorian engineers Cuthbert A. Brereton (Sir John Wolfe Barry's partner) and Robert Maitland Brereton (chief engineer on part of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway and advocate in the US Congress for the building of irrigation canals in California).\n\nBrereton was recruited by Brunel staff in 1836 to be one of seven resident engineers supervising the construction of the Great Western Railway. He lost an eye in a work accident and is depicted in a portrait with an eye patch. After the Great Western railway was completed, he carried out similar tasks on other railways that Brunel was building. For example, in 1845 he was one of Brunel's resident engineers on the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway and was sent to Italy to sort out problems with the construction of the Turin–Genoa railway.\n\nHe became Brunel's chief assistant in 1847 and remained in this post until Brunel's death in 1859. His signature appears on drawings for the Chepstow Bridge which were prepared in Brunel's London office around 1850.\n\nOne of Brunel's major and long-running projects was the construction of the Royal Albert Bridge across the River Tamar for the Cornwall Railway. In 1854 Brereton was sent as Brunel's assistant to help William Glennie, the resident engineer on the bridge, who was in poor health. Much of his time in the next five years was spent on this project. He was instrumental in developing ways to excavate underwater to prepare for the construction of the central pier. In 1857 he assisted Brunel when the first span was floated into position, and he then supervised the lengthy process to raise it to the top of its piers. Brunel's poor health increasingly prevented him from attending work in Cornwall, and so Brereton supervised the floating out of the second span in 1858 without Brunel's help. He then saw through the raising of this span, the completion of the bridge and opening of the line in May 1859.\n\nAfter Brunel's death in September 1859 Brereton took over his role as chief engineer for many railway companies, designing new works and alterations. He ran his business from Brunel's old office in Duke Street, London, while Brunel's widow Mary continued to reside in the rooms above. Some of Brunel's railways were still under construction, including the\n\nBrunel described Brereton in 1845 as \"a peculiarly energetic persevering young man\". The Chairman of the Cornwall Railway, speaking in 1859 following the opening of the Royal Albert Bridge, described him as \"always ready, always able, always full of energy.\"\n\nHe has a memorial brass in the church in Blakeney.\n\nSources\n"}

The Italian past participle \"sgraffiato\" is also used, especially of pottery.\n\nThe word \"sgraffito\" comes from the Italian language and is derived from \"graffiare\" (\"to scratch\"), ultimately from the Greek (\"gráphein\", \"to write\"). Related terms include graffito and graffiti.\n\nSgraffito on walls has been used in Europe since classical times, it was popularized in Italy in the 15th and 16th centuries and can be found in African art. In combination with ornamental decoration these techniques formed an alternative to the prevailing painting of walls. Of late there has been an unmistakable growing interest in this old technique. The technical procedure is relatively simple, and the procedures are similar to the painting of frescoes.\n\nSgraffito played a significant role during the Italian Renaissance, with two of Raphael's workshop, Polidoro da Caravaggio and his partner Maturino da Firenze, among the leading specialists, painting palace facades in Rome and other cities. Most of their work has now weathered away. During the 16th century, the technique was brought to Germany by the master builders of the Renaissance and taken up with enthusiasm. As a simple native art, old examples of sgraffito can be found in the wide surroundings of Wetterau and Marburg. In Germany, the technique is most predominant in Bavaria. The use of sgraffito was common in the creation of housing façades for the purposes of advertising. The technique was also used in Thuringia, the Engadin, Austria and Transylvania.\n\nIn Catalonia, sgraffito was implemented in the early 20th century by the Noucentista neo-classical architects and became a recurrent technique in façade decoration.\n\nAnother use of sgraffito is seen in its simplified painting technique. One coat of paint is left to dry on a canvas or sheet of paper. Another coat of a different color is painted on top of the first layer. The artist then uses a palette knife or oil stick to scratch out a design, leaving behind an image in the color of the first coat of paint. This can also be achieved by using oil pastels for the first layer and black ink for the top layer. Sometimes a first coat of paint is not needed, and the wet coat scraped back reveals the canvas. This cannot be achieved by using the oil pastel method. This technique is often used in art classes to teach the sgraffito technique to novice art students.\n\nIn glass making, sgraffito refers to creating imagery with finely powdered black glass on a sheet glass substrate.\nSgraffito is a subtractive technique; light areas are created by scraping away the powdered glass, while dark areas are made by adding piles of powder. The powdered glass is manipulated with a variety of tools. The finished drawing is very vulnerable until the piece is fired in a kiln.\n\nExamples of graphic work on facades saw a resurgence circa 1890 through 1915, in the context of the rise of the Arts and Crafts Movement, the Vienna Secession, and particularly the Art Nouveau movement in Belgium and France.\n\nThe English artist Heywood Sumner has been identified as this era's pioneer of the technique, for example his work at the 1892 St Mary's Church, Sunbury, Surrey. Sumner's work is sgraffito \"per se\", scratched plaster, but the term has come to encompass a variety of techniques for producing exterior graphic decoration.\n\nOther examples include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1990694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990694", "title": "Mobile billboard", "text": "Mobile billboard\n\nA mobile billboard also known as \"digital billboard trucks\" is, a device used for advertising on the sides of a truck or trailer that is typically mobile. Mobile billboards are a form of out-of-home advertising (OOH); radio, static billboards, and mall/airport advertising fall into this same category. Using a mobile billboard for advertising is an advertising niche called mobile outdoor advertising.\n\nMost mobile billboards are dedicated, customized LED trucks with large bodies for displaying advertisements. Some of these dedicated units offer features such as external sound systems, illumination, LED panels and hot/cold boxes for product sampling, although they are illegal in many cities. Digital mobile billboard trucks have become popular, but the most capable in terms of gaining exposure are static mobile billboards. Static mobile billboards do not share advertising space. \n\nSome of the most cost effective mobile billboards are installed wraps on trucks and trailers that are in service delivering goods serving as multi-purpose vehicles achieving \"green status\" or \"truck side advertising\". \n\nBox-type trucks with panels enclosing the cargo space can be turned into a mobile 3D display case. Many companies use these trucks for parades, product launches, furniture displays, and general rapid-awareness creation. Almost anything can be placed inside of the boxes for display.\n\nFor micromarketing campaigns, small-engine scooters and human walking billboards are used for experiential marketing and direct to consumer marketing. This form has become a very effective intercity advertising method for Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAdvertisements on standard billboard trucks are installed by applying large vinyl sheets as decals, or by fastening a large sheet of vinyl to the sides of the truck or trailer using specialized aluminum frames.\nWith the new LED mobile digital billboard trucks require large expensive screens to be installed on trucks.\n\nIndustry analysts, researchers and trade representatives have researched the effectiveness of mobile billboards. \"Outdoor Advertising Magazine\" said that outdoor mobile media billboards have a 97% recall rate, and 96% of survey respondents thought mobile advertising is more effective than traditional outdoor advertising. 3M and the American Trucking Association noted 91% of the target noticed the text and graphics on truck advertising, and the Traffic Audit Bureau noted that on local routes monthly impressions ranged from one to four million hits. Product Acceptance and Research said 94% of respondents recalled seeing the Mobile Billboard, with 80% recalling the specific advertisement; the billboards resulted in a sales increase of 107%.\n\nMobile Billboards are generally used due to the perceived benefits such as being able to deliver a message in places where traditional billboards are unavailable. They also offer a median that does not get cluttered by other advertisements and are not generally seen near competitors. Many also find it advantageous that the message is less likely to be tuned out by drivers than other advertising medians.\n\nSome municipalities have strict laws against mobile advertisements. Adbikes and billboard bicycles can often be used as a substitute. Smaller cities code compliance often use a complaint driven model wherein the smaller lighter trucks seem to have fewer complaints and are often allowed. These mobile billboard trucks have been welcomed more by municipalities over the larger trucks.\n\nIn the US, mobile advertising falls under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The US Supreme Court has issued rulings that protect \"commercial speech\" as well. Hence, it is difficult for any jurisdiction to limit such advertising beyond public safety issues. Since most complaints regarding mobile advertising relate to oversized trucks with loudspeakers, the bigger companies are more likely to have lawyers on retainer who can remind the authorities of US Constitutional protection of free speech and commerce. However, content-neutral regulations of speech with a legitimate government interest are subject to a more deferential standard of review. Ordinances banning mobile billboards on traffic and public safety grounds, regardless of message and without singling out commercial advertisement, have been largely upheld as legitimately and reasonably regulating the \"form\", and not \"content\", of speech.\n\nIn Norway, the use of wrap advertising on buses was prohibited by the road authorities. The reason behind the ban was that in an emergency, the windows might need to serve as an emergency exit and that the advertising would make the window harder to break with the emergency hammer. Gaia Trafikk argued against the ban, pointing out that their tests showed that the thin wrap had no impact on the breakability of the window, but did remove the advertising which covered the windows.\n\nThere are many other forms of outdoor mobile advertising, which are considered mobile billboards by some advertising professionals. \n\nOne such form is called wrap advertising, which differs from mobile billboards because wrap advertisements typically envelop an entire vehicle, typically a car or small truck, while mobile billboards are large flat surfaces like traditional billboards. \n\nOther mobile advertising formats include bicycles, airplane banner towing, blimps, and mobile billboards on water, towed by boats.\n\n"}

{"id": "1990703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990703", "title": "Sierra Morena", "text": "Sierra Morena\n\nThe Sierra Morena is one of the main systems of mountain ranges in Spain. It stretches for 450 kilometres from east to west across the south of the Iberian Peninsula, forming the southern border of the \"Meseta Central\" plateau and providing the watershed between the valleys of the Guadiana to the north and the west, and the Guadalquivir to the south.\n\nIts highest summit is 1,332 m high Bañuela. Other notable peaks are Corral de Borros 1,312 m and Cerro de la Estrella 1,298 m.\n\nThe name \"Sierra Morena\" has a strong legendary reputation in Spanish culture and tradition, with myths about bandits \"(Los bandidos de Sierra Morena)\", a giant snake \"(El Saetón de Sierra Morena)\" and a child brought up by wolves (Marcos Rodríguez Pantoja), among others. This range is also mentioned in the famous Mexican song \"Cielito Lindo\" and in one of the most well known traditional Spanish songs, \"Soy Minero\", interpreted by Antonio Molina.\n\nThe Sierra Morena stretches for 450 km in an E-W direction from the high course of the Guadalmena River in the Sierra del Relumbrar until northwestern Huelva Province, extending into Portugal. The system is the result of the uplift produced by the pressure of the northward-moving African Plate. It is made up of hard Paleozoic rocks such as granite and quartzite, as well as softer materials such as slate and gneiss.\n\nIts name, roughly meaning 'dark range', is likely derived from the dark color of some of the rocks and vegetation of the ranges that make up the mountainous system. It is also mentioned as \"Sierra Mariánica\" in some documents. Formerly it was a border area, a vast wilderness with little population, and its mountain passes were important for the communication between Andalusia and Central Spain.\n\nThe peaks of the ranges are not very high on average, in fact Sierra Morena's highest point is the lowest among the mountain systems of the Iberian Peninsula. They are, however, very consistent in altitude, averaging between 600 and 1,300 m all along the system. \nSince they form the southern edge of the \"Meseta Central\", the Iberian Central Plateau, the northern Sierra Morena ranges barely rise above the level of the surrounding plateau in most places. Nevertheless, the Sierra Morena looks like a true mountain range seen from the Baetic Depression in the south with impressive southward-facing slopes and gorges. \nLocated within the province of Jaén, the Despeñaperros, an abrupt canyon created by the Despeñaperros River, with sheer walls over 500 metres high, is the natural path for crossing the Sierra Morena into Andalusia from the north of the peninsula.\n\nThe main ranges of the Sierra Morena system from east to west are:\n\nThe ranges of Sierra Morena have valuable deposits of lead, silver, mercury, and other metals, some of which have been exploited since prehistoric times. \nThe ancient Iberians used the mountain passes as a passage between the high plateau in the north and the Guadalquivir basin.\n\nThe bleak Sierra Morena mountains were also notorious in former times for being a haunt of bandits and highwaymen. The \"Nuevas Poblaciones de Andalucía y Sierra Morena\" administrative division was started in 1767 during the reign of Charles III of Spain in order to populate the mountainous zone. As a consequence the area around La Carolina was settled with farmers that included German, Swiss and Flemish families. One of the goals of the project was to have safe stopover points for carriages in the desolate region that would be within reasonable distance from each other.\n\nMarcos Rodríguez Pantoja was a child born in Añora who lived by himself in the middle of the Sierra Morena in the area that is now the Sierra de Cardeña y Montoro Natural Park. The film “Entre lobos” by the Cordovan director Gerardo Olivares was based on his experience.\n\nThe Sierra Morena was the scenario of many battles and skirmishes throughout the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe battle of Cerro Muriano, part of the August 1936 Córdoba offensive in the region, is famous owing to the picture of a \"falling militiaman\" taken by Robert Capa, a picture that sought to represent the tragic fate of the Spanish Republic.\n\nThe Battle of Valsequillo (also known as 'Battle of Peñarroya'), involving the Extremaduran Army took place further west in the area of the range at the Extremaduran front line between 5 January and 4 February 1939 towards the end of the conflict.\n\nThe Sierra Morena appears in the novel \"Don Quixote\". When Sancho Panza suggests the mountains as a refuge from the Holy Brotherhood after Don Quixote frees a group of galley slaves, the two escape into the Sierra Morena. In the mountains, Quixote contemplates the burdens of knighthood. In Voltaire's satire \"Candide\", the main characters stop there on their escape from Lisbon (chapter 9–10).\n\nNikolay Karamzin's 1793 prose \"Sierra-Morena\", where the Russian writer tells of a love story between the author and young Elvira, is also dedicated to the mountain range. \n\nThe forbidding landscape of Sierra Morena was also the setting for the majority of the eerie and supernatural goings-on in Jan Potocki's \"The Manuscript Found in Saragossa\" written in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\n\nThe Sierra Morena is one of the last habitats of the endangered Iberian lynx. \nOther charismatic animals of the region include the Iberian wolf, (2019 declared extinct regionally by the Large Carnivore Initiative for Europe), Wild boar, Red deer, the Spanish imperial eagle and the Golden eagle. Among the amphibians, wells and ponds in many areas of the range provide a habitat for the near-threatened Iberian ribbed newt. \n\nA National Geographic Channel documentary film featuring an overview of some of the region's wildlife was produced in 2015. \n\nCertain sectors of Sierra Morena's are protected areas, including natural parks:\n\n\n"}

The show stars Annie Potts and Lorraine Toussaint, who are best friends despite the difference in their races.\n\nThe show's title is taken from the 1962 Chuck Jackson song \"Any Day Now\". A version performed by Lori Perry served as the show's theme song.\n\n\"Any Day Now\" focuses on the lives and interactions of two female protagonists: Mary Elizabeth \"M.E.\" O'Brien Sims (Potts) and Rene Jackson (Toussaint). The two had grown up as close friends in Birmingham, Alabama, in the 1960s during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement. However, their friendship ended when M.E. became pregnant and chose, despite Rene's disapproval, to keep the child, drop out of college, and marry her boyfriend, Colliar Sims.\n\nMore than twenty years later, M.E. and her husband still live in Birmingham, where they struggle to make ends meet. Their oldest son, Bobby, died as a child; but they have two more children, daughter Kelly and son Davis. Rene moved to Washington, D.C., where she was a successful attorney for many years; but, after the death of her father, Rene decides to move back to Birmingham and establish a law practice there. She reunites with M.E., and the two quickly resume their close friendship. In every episode, contemporary storylines are interwoven with a storyline from their shared past.\n\nEach hour-long episode contained alternating scenes from two different timelines. The 1960s timeline followed the young version of the girls, who became friends despite the discomfort of M.E.'s naively bigoted parents and her openly racist Uncle Jimmy, an avowed member of the Ku Klux Klan. M.E. and Rene's friendship was fostered by M.E.'s loving grandmother and her older brother, Johnny, who was sent to Vietnam, while M.E.'s older sister, Teresa, often threatened to tell their parents that M.E.'s \"little colored friend\" had been in their house. Colliar Sims (Chris Mulkey), M.E.'s childhood sweetheart and eventual husband, played a large role in this timeline as well. Rene's family included her father, James (John Lafayette), who was a lawyer and an active member of the Civil Rights Movement; her mother, Sarah, also active in the movement; and her older brother Elston, who was the same age as M.E.'s brother Johnny but dodged the draft by fleeing to Canada.\n\nThe contemporary timeline showed M.E. and Rene as adults. M.E. was a homemaker with aspirations of becoming a writer, and Rene starts her own law firm in Birmingham. Characters from the 1960s timeline appeared in the contemporary timeline as well, such as Rene's widowed mother, her brother Elston (openly gay, with an adopted son), M.E.'s oft-divorced sister Teresa (Delta Burke), and M.E.'s aging parents, whose views on race had mellowed somewhat over the years, quite in contrast to unrepentantly racist Uncle Jimmy, who still antagonized Rene if given the chance.\n\nThe show dealt with issues like modern-day racism, homosexuality, religion, women's rights, rape, natural disaster, alcohol, suicide, and death. During Season 3, M.E.'s daughter Kelly dated an African-American boy, Ajoni (Derrex Brady), and became pregnant by him at age 17, much to Colliar's dismay; Kelly and Ajoni chose to marry and keep the baby, whom they named Emmett. Eventually, M.E. published a book and was invited to teach at the local college. Rene's over-all story arc dealt mainly with her law practice; although she enjoyed great success as a lawyer, eventually focusing her practice on civil rights law, she sometimes regretted that she had never married nor had a family. In the final episode of the show, Rene married Judge Clyde \"Turk\" Terhune (William Allen Young).\n\nIn most episodes there was either a common theme between the scenes presented from each timeline, or a direct connection between the events depicted in the past and how it affected those in the present.\n\nIn the fourth season, the actresses Mae Middleton (M.E.) and Shari Dyon Perry (Rene) were replaced by Olivia Hack and Maya Goodwin, respectively, as the producers wanted the girls to encounter more mature storylines. However, Dan Byrd kept the role of Colliar Sims.\n\n\"Any Day Now\" ended after 88 episodes, with Rene's marriage, as well as M.E. and Rene's mothers finally putting an end to their decades-long animosity.\n\n\n\nAll performances were categorized into the \"Best Performance in a TV Drama Series\" category.\n\n\n\n\n\n2000–2001 — (Nominated) Best Family TV Drama Series\n\n2000 Primetime Emmy Awards — (Nominated) Outstanding Costumes for a Series: Mary Anne Aston (Costume Supervisor); Elizabeth P.

The game allowed players to perform exaggerated, gravity-defying action moves, including wall running, stunning, tumbling, and blocking bullets with swords, in the style of action films and anime.\n\nIn Quest mode, players, in a group of up to 4 members, went through parts of a map for a certain number of stages, which were determined by the quest level. In each stage, players were required to kill 18 to 44 creatures, and the game ended when every member of the player team died or completed all of the stages. Quests could take place in the Prison, Mansion, or Dungeon map.\n\nPlayers could make the quests tougher and more profitable by using special quest items to increase the quest level that could be bought from the in-game store or obtained during a quest. Quest items in-game were stored in glowing chests that spawned where the monster that it came from died; certain items could have been dropped depending on the monster killed. Players ran through these to obtain an item randomly selected from the possibilities of that monster. The items obtained depended on the monster that the chest came from. By sacrificing certain items in combination, players could enter a boss quest. Boss items were obtained through pages and other boss quests, and pages were obtained through the in-game shop. The quest system was designed to reduce the amount of time needed to prepare for boss raids that are typical in many other online games.\n\nA significant and unique part of the gameplay was the movement system. Players could run on walls, perform flips off of them, and do quick mid-air dodges in any horizontal direction. Advanced movement and combat techniques were commonly referred to as \"K-Style\" or Korean style; a variety of techniques fell under this category. These usually exploited the game's animation and weapon switch systems through a series of animation cancellations to allow the player to perform another action rapidly after the first. One example was the wall cancel; unlike the initially intended, and linear method of running on walls, the player can simply jump (Done by pressing space, with default keyboard settings), dashing in the direction of a wall while still mid-air (done by double tapping either A, W, S or D, depending on where the wall is in relation to the direction of the camera angle) once close enough to slice or stab the wall with the chosen melee weapon (done by pressing the left mouse button). This would cause the player to gain height and momentum by back flipping upwards off of the wall once. With successive timed wall cancellations, it is possible to stay near a wall, descend, ascend or even travel along the side of walls indefinitely, all depending on the angle of the camera angle, and the speed by which the wall-cancellations are produced (slower; descend/staying. Faster; ascend). This, in addition to the fact that these techniques were possible as a result of exploiting flaws in the animation system, has resulted in them being controversial but they became largely accepted as part of the game.\n\n\"GunZ\"s networking system in most parts of the game was peer to peer. Players connect to other players through their client, instead of through a central server.\n\nThe closed beta for ijji \"GunZ\" ended on November 17, 2006. ijji \"GunZ\" subsequently went live on November 29, 2006. The live service included clan wars and quest mode. The premium item shop was opened on January 8, 2007. Quest mode was updated on February 14, 2007. New sounds and voice narrations were added to the game on May 9, 2007.\n\nIn 2011 the source code of GunZ 1.5 became available online.\n\nThe game was managed on an international gaming portal by ijji games until management shifted to the Aeria Games gaming portal in March 2012.\n\nIn the first week of May 2013 (1st on the forums and on the homepage), Aeria announced that the game would be cancelled on May 31, and that the forums would be deleted in June. They would only refund AP purchased during those final four weeks.

{"id": "1990728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990728", "title": "Cy Denneny", "text": "Cy Denneny\n\nCyril Joseph Denneny (December 23, 1891 – September 10, 1970) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played for the Ottawa Senators and Boston Bruins in the National Hockey League and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association. His brother Corbett Denneny also played in the NHL.\n\nCy Denneny was born in Farran's Point, Ontario, near Cornwall. He was the son of James Israel Denneny who was a top lacrosse player in the late 19th century and was descended from the Dennenys of County Monaghan, Ireland.\n\nDenneny played senior hockey in Cornwall, starting with the Cornwall Sons of England of the Lower Ottawa Valley hockey league in 1909–10. His professional playing career began with the Toronto Ontarios/Shamrocks of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1914. (The name of the team changed during the season) He had tried out for the Montreal Canadiens in 1912 but failed to make the team and he returned to senior hockey. He was traded to the Ottawa Senators in 1916 and he would play with the Senators until 1928. He was member of four Senators Stanley Cup-winning teams; in 1920, 1921, 1923 and 1927. With the Senators during the 1917–18 season, Denneny set an NHL record by opening the season with four straight multi-goal games. Though the record still stands, it was tied in 2013 by San Jose Sharks' forward Patrick Marleau. Denneny was sold to Boston in 1928, where he would be the playing-coach of the Bruins' 1929 Stanley Cup-winner.\n\nIn 1929, Denneny retired to become an NHL on-ice official. In 1932, he re-joined the Senators as head coach, but the team was in decline due to financial difficulties which forced management to sell top players in order to survive. The team finished last and Denneny was not retained as coach.\n\nDenneny was one of the top scorers in the NHL from 1917 through 1925. While leading the league in scoring during the 1923–24 NHL season, he did so by recording 22 goals and one assist for a total of 23 points, the lowest winning total in NHL history. When he retired, he was the all-time top scorer in NHL history. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959. In 1998, he was ranked number 62 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. He was the first and remains the fastest player in NHL history to score 200 goals (181 GP). During a six-week span in the 1920–21 NHL season, Cy and his brother Corbett (Toronto St. Patricks), each scored six goals during a game—a feat accomplished by only five other players in the history of the NHL.\n\nDespite not being a swift skater, Denneny had one of the most deceptive and accurate shots in the league, which enabled him to achieve his scoring feats so rapidly. He was one of the first known players to use opposing defencemen as screens, and would beat goaltenders with head fakes and subsequently with shots that often would not even leave the ice. Denneny was also one of the very first players to use a curved blade, which he used to take high-rising shots as well as \"sinkers\" that would fool goaltenders. He was a very physical player who often acted as an enforcer for his more passive linemates, Jack Darragh and Frank Nighbor.\n\nDenneny was married twice. His first wife Melvina died, and Denneny remarried. He was the father of two daughters with his second wife Isobel. After Denneny retired from hockey, he worked for the Canadian federal government. He retired from civil service in 1959. He died on September 10, 1970 and is buried in Ottawa's Pinecrest Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

His co-hosts from his former show return when it had first aired on WXRK 92.3 FM: K-ROCK in New York. They include his friends Reed Tucker (jokingly mocked as the \"useless producer\") and \"Big\" Wayne (Lazlow's sidekick). As of January 2, 2010, \"The Lazlow Show\" no longer airs on satellite radio. He and his staff were reportedly dissatisfied by Sirius' treatment of the show after Sirius took over XM. Since then, the program has later been streamed live on the internet on an irregular schedule. On November 3, 2014, long-time co-host \"Big\" Wayne died of a heart attack in New York City, leaving the future of the show on hiatus.

Integrity's sole program consists of his on-site reporting from around Liberty City. The content of this show is more profane than previous installments, with the character's justification being that he's \"fed up with the system.\" He provides the ZiT! service, where listeners can request the artist and title of the song currently playing on the radio. He is also credited among others for creating the conversations of pedestrians in Liberty City. He has an in-game criminal record, as can be seen in the Liberty City Police Department database.\n\nOn 15 September 2013, Lazlow presented a special radio show alongside Pete Donaldson on Absolute Radio in the United Kingdom to celebrate the launch of \"Grand Theft Auto V\".

He is an Honoured Member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Dumart's uncle Ezra Dumart was also a professional ice hockey player.\n\nDumart was raised in Kitchener, Ontario. He played his junior hockey with the Kitchener Greenshirts of the Ontario Hockey Association on a line with childhood friends Milt Schmidt and Bobby Bauer, which was dubbed the \"Kraut line\" by Albert Leduc, a defenceman for the Montreal Canadiens. After two seasons with the Greenshirts, the entire Kraut Line was signed by the Bruins.\n\nAfter spending the bulk of the 1935–36 and 1936–37 seasons in the minor leagues with the Boston Cubs of the Can-Am League, Dumart made the Bruins for good in early 1937. Reunited with Schmidt and Bauer, the trio become one of the most famous lines in hockey history. Dumart – at 6'1\", one of the largest wingers of his day – was the skilled checking and defensive component to the line, while contributing good scoring, and helped lead the Bruins to Stanley Cup victories in 1939 and 1941. His contributions were recognized by being named the left wing on the Second All-Star Team in both 1939–40 and 1940–41.\n\nThen World War II intervened – leading to the line being renamed, briefly and abortively, the \"Kitchener Kids\" due to anti-German sentiment – and Dumart enlisted with teammates Schmidt, Bauer and Frank Brimsek. Joining the Royal Canadian Air Force halfway through the 1941–42 season, Dumart joined the Ottawa RCAF Flyers hockey team which challenged for the Allan Cup, Canada's senior league championship, and scored over a goal a game in leading the team to the title. He played briefly in the fall of 1942 for the Flyers before being shipped overseas, where he served until the end of the war.\n\nDumart returned in 1945 and played nine more seasons for Boston, and was named a Second Team All-Star for the third time in 1947.\n\nHis scoring skills diminishing in his final years, he ended his NHL career with Boston after the 1954 playoffs. He played one last stint the following season with the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League, suiting up for fifteen games before hanging up his skates at last.\n\nDumart retired having played sixteen NHL seasons in all, scoring 211 goals and 218 assists for 429 points in 772 games.\n\nHe settled in the Boston area, and remained active with charitable affairs, being the longtime coach of the Bruins' Alumni Association team. He was father of three: Jeff, Judy, and Bruce.\n\nOn his way to Ray Bourque Night, with his son Jeff Dumart, at the FleetCenter, Woody suddenly became ill with heart trouble and was taken to the hospital, where he died on October 19, 2001.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1990776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990776", "title": "Babe Dye", "text": "Babe Dye\n\nCecil Henry \"Babe\" Dye (May 13, 1897 – January 3, 1962) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played 11 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Toronto St. Patricks/Maple Leafs, Hamilton Tigers, Chicago Black Hawks, and the New York Americans. Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Dye was known as an excellent stick-handler, and goal-scorer.\n\nDye began his professional ice hockey career with the Toronto St. Patricks in 1919. He became the NHL's scoring champion in the 1922–23 season, a feat he repeated during the 1924–25 season. In 1926, the St. Patricks sold Dye's contract to the Chicago Black Hawks. In 1927, Dye suffered a major leg injury during training camp, and did not return to play until the last 10 games of that season. Following that season, he was traded to the New York Americans. Dye's production dropped significantly as a result of his leg injury, and was reassigned to the Americans' minor league affiliate, the New Haven Eagles in 1929. The next year, Dye signed as a free agent with the first professional team he played for, since renamed the Maple Leafs. Dye played six games with the Maple Leafs before he retired from the sport.\n\nHe won his only Stanley Cup with the St. Patricks, in 1922. He was the NHL's top goal scorer of the 1920s, and remains the St. Patricks/Maple Leafs' all-time franchise points per game leader. Dye was posthumously inducted as a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1970, eight years after his death.\n\nIn addition to playing professional ice hockey, he also played professional baseball with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Buffalo Bisons, and the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He also was a halfback for the Toronto Argonauts, a Canadian football team.\n\nBorn in Hamilton, Ontario, Dye moved to Toronto when he was one year old, following the death of his father. Dye credited his goal-scoring abilities to his mother, who had built Dye an outdoor rink, as well as ensuring that he completed his skating and shooting drills. He played junior hockey from 1916 to 1918 for the Toronto Aura Lee and Toronto De La Salle of the Ontario Hockey Association. As a senior, he played for the amateur Toronto St. Patricks in 1918–19.\n\nDye made his professional ice hockey debut in the 1919–20 season with the Toronto St. Patricks of the NHL. A slow skater, Dye was known for his hard and accurate shot. He played with the St. Pats for eight seasons, leading the league in goals scored in the 1920–21, 1922–23, and 1924–25 seasons, leading the league in scoring in 1923 and 1925, and finishing second in goals scored in 1921–22 and 1923–24. When the Quebec Bulldogs moved to Hamilton in 1920 to become the Hamilton Tigers, Dye was loaned to the team for their first game; a native of Hamilton and a former star in the amateur OHA, it was hoped he would boost the attendance, as he was familiar to spectators.\n\nHe led the St. Patricks to Stanley Cup championship in 1922, scoring nine goals in the five-game final series. In 1926, Dye was also inadvertently responsible for Conn Smythe's dismissal from the New York Rangers, after Smythe disagreed with the Rangers' owner, John S. Hammond, about acquiring Dye. By the end of the 1925-26 season, the toll of playing two professional sports was becoming apparent to St. Patricks' management. Because of the club's suspicions that playing two professional sports would take a toll on Dye's body, as well as their own financial struggles, in 1926, the club announced that Dye's contract would be up for bid.\n\nBefore the 1926–27 season, the Toronto St. Pats sold Dye to the Chicago Black Hawks, a new NHL franchise. Dye had an outstanding season in Chicago, again leading the league in goals scored on the NHL's highest-scoring team, playing on a line with fellow Hamilton-born player Dick Irvin, who led the league in assists. Unfortunately, both players would soon suffer serious injuries that curtailed their playing careers. At training camp before the next season, Dye's leg was broken and he was never the same player again. He went scoreless for the Black Hawks in 10 games in the 1927–28 season and was then sold to the New York Americans. Over 42 games in 1928–29, Dye had just one goal for the Americans. In November 1929, he was traded to the minor league New Haven Eagles of the Canadian-American Hockey League.\n\nIn February 1930, he was signed as a free agent by his former team in Toronto, which had been renamed the Maple Leafs. Dye played six games with the club in the 1930–31 season before being released. Over his final 58 games in the NHL after his injury in 1927, Dye had scored just one goal. His 38 goals in the 30-game 1924–25 season set a St. Pats/Maple Leafs franchise record that stood for 35 years until broken by Frank Mahovlich in the 70-game 1960–61 season. Over his first six seasons in the NHL, Dye scored 176 goals in 170 games.\n\nDye was also a professional baseball player, beginning his career with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League in 1920. He was sent to Brantford of the Class B Michigan-Ontario League, popularly known as the Mint League. The Boston Red Sox held an option on Dye but chose not to exercise it.\n\nIn September 1921, the Brantford baseball club announced that it had sold Dye to the Buffalo Bisons of the IL for the highest price ever paid for a Brantford player. He had a strong season with the Bisons in 1923, and was then considered a top prospect for the major leagues. In September 1923, Dye announced that he was retiring from hockey to focus on baseball, but when the hockey season started he re-signed with the St. Pats. After the hockey season, he rejoined the Bisons for training camp in March 1924. \"Dye is surely a nifty baseball player, a good hitter, reliable outfielder, and speedy on the base paths,\" reported \"The Sporting News\" in August 1924. Dye again played for the Bisons in 1925, and was sold to the baseball Leafs after the end of the season. He was released by Toronto in July 1926 and signed by the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, where he finished his baseball career that year.\n\nWhile not known as a fast skater, Dye was an excellent stickhandler and possessed one of the hardest and most accurate wrist shots in hockey during his tenure with the league. Almost unique among his contemporaries with the exception of Gordie Roberts and Harry Cameron, he was capable of great precision from long distances, while maintaining unrivaled velocity. As a testament to this combination of power and precision, Dye scored 12 of his 31 goals from behind the red line, during his third season with Toronto.\n\nDye's release was so quick that, on occasion, his goals would be in dispute because neither the linesmen, referee or goaltender had seen them enter the net. A notable instance of this occurred during the 1922 Finals versus the Vancouver Millionaires. Toronto centreman Reg Noble won a faceoff in the Vancouver end, passing the puck back to Dye. The right winger immediately whipped the puck past Hugh \"Old Eagle Eyes\" Lehman, who had stood stock still without noticing the rubber entering his net. Players from both teams and the on-ice officials took several seconds to find the puck before the game could resume. It was one of 9 goals he would score during the winning series, and this remains a Stanley Cup record since the playoff format was implemented in 1914; Frank McGee's 15 goals in two games remains the all-time Stanley Cup single-series goal-scoring record.\nAlthough weighing a mere 150 pounds, Dye had immensely strong arms and used a stick made of solid hickory. While hockey sticks at the time were commonly made from maple, yellow birch, ironwood, ash or hickory, the latter is by far the strongest and most flexible. It is also far harder than the others, without being exceptionally brittle like ironwood, which is twice as hard as hickory. Dye used this stick and his wrist strength to propel the puck at occasionally dangerous speeds, and his \"wicked drives\" and shots that goalies \"could not see\" were mentioned many times in game summaries. His shots were capable of snapping a two-inch thick plank, and Jack Adams recalled seeing several of Dye's drives punch clean through the back-rests of arena seats and even through the 1/8-inch thick wire mesh used as crowd protection at Toronto's Arena Gardens. Opposing defencemen would attempt to knock down long shots made by Dye from centre ice, only to find out in dismay that their sticks had been shattered in two.\n\nSprague Cleghorn claimed that Babe Dye was the best shot of anyone he'd ever seen, and Adams rated him as superior in ability to Bryan Hextall, Grindy Forrester, Didier Pitre, Carson \"Shovel-Shot\" Cooper and even Charlie Conacher: \"Dye was the peer of them all\".\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Dye coached the Port Colborne Sailors to the Ontario Sr A Finals, and the following season he became head coach of the Chicago Shamrocks of the American Hockey Association in 1931–32, winning the league title. Despite the team's success, Dye was fired just before the championship-winning game because he hadn't prevented the team captain from going to Toronto to get married between games of the championship series. Dye said the player was determined to go and there was nothing he could do about it. The Shamrocks ended up folding before the next season began.\n\nAfter hockey, Dye worked for Seneca Petroleum in Chicago for 20 years. He died at the age of 63 in Chicago, where he had been hospitalized for several months following a heart attack. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1970. In 1998, he was ranked number 83 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990778", "title": "The Power of Four", "text": "The Power of Four\n\n\"The Power of Four\" is a joint anthem composed for the British and Irish Lions rugby union team. It was written by Neil Myers in 2005. It was commissioned by the Lions head coach, Sir Clive Woodward for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand as the official song. It was intended to be a universal anthem for the British and Irish Lions to be sung before every game. However it was criticised as being uninspiring as members of the Lions squad did not engage with it and it was also noted that the fans did not like it. It was dropped as the Lions anthem after the 2005 tour and led to changes in the way music would be chosen in future Lions tours.\n\nHistorically, the British and Irish Lions were intended as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State broke away from the United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and Irish Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and Irish Lions did not have an anthem to represent them before any of their matches until 2005.\n\nThe Power of Four was commissioned by Sir Clive Woodward for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand and was written by Neil Myers. It was recorded by the Melody Music Lions Choir. The song is a classical composition played in a high key. It was first performed live by Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins before the British and Irish Lions rugby union match against Argentina at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales in 2005. it was performed despite suggestions of either God Save the Queen, the Welsh national anthem Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau or a combination of the anthems of the Home Nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland being played instead of The Power of Four. It is always sung in English.\n\nBefore the British and Irish Lions squad was selected, Woodward sent out bracelets with \"The Power of Four\" printed on them to potential British and Irish Lions players to try and create a sense of unity and to make them think about the upcoming tour to New Zealand. This was criticised as being \"crazy\". The Power of Four was also used as a motivational slogan in some of the Lions' team building activities.\n\nThe lyrics of The Power of Four were circulated to all of the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they would know the words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation to sing it.\n\nThe BBC opined during the British and Irish Lions' warm-up game against Otago that it was not inspiring for the Lions supporters to sing. Austin Healey observed that the players did not appear to like The Power of Four when it was performed.\n\nBefore the first Test match, it was noticed that despite British and Irish Lions fans being filmed singing The Power of Four, none of the players did sing it when it was played as the Lions anthem before God Defend New Zealand. It was also noted that Lions fans felt that The Power of Four was not catching on and some even suggested that Axel F would be better than The Power of Four. It was also suggested that due to a perceived selection bias towards English members of the Lions, that Land of Hope and Glory should be used instead of The Power of Four. The acting British and Irish Lions captain Martin Corry said that he did not attempt to sing The Power of Four because he felt that he would not be able to reach the correct notes. In 2009, British and Irish Lions player Alun Wyn Jones said that \"I'd rather sing The Power of Love\" when asked if he would want to sing The Power of Four.\n\nThe song experienced a mixed response in the media. In July 2005, following the Lions tour, a journalist on the BBC Sport website, James Standley, commented that The Power of Four is \"hollow and disliked by fans.\" However, Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward said he hoped it would \"stir the passions\". It was also described in The Independent as an \"excruciating mix of politburo and classical pop\". However Danny Stevens in \"The New Zealand Herald\" said that \"The Power of Four was not a bad song but unfortunately nobody actually knew the tune or the words.\" The words of The Power of Four were also compared to be similar to the New Zealand Māori rugby union team's \"Timatanga\" haka in The Telegraph.\n\nThe anthem did not return for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, which received a positive reaction from Sky Sports reporters.\n\nThe negative reception of The Power of Four was listed as one of the issues used to criticise Woodward for the failures of the tour. It was also pointed out that Woodward and team manager, Bill Beaumont used The Power of Four whenever they entered into a press conference which led to the press conferences being referred to as possibly being \"mistaken for a revivalist meeting\".\n\nThe Power of Four was so negatively received, that it was announced that future British and Irish Lions tours would have songs and themes chosen by a musical committee set up in the wake of the 2005 tour instead of by the team coach. After 2005, The Power of Four became largely forgotten. During the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, ESPN jokingly suggested that The Power of Four would be remixed into a hip hop song for the third test by Pharrell Williams and would be performed by Snoop Dogg.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1990779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990779", "title": "Lucky duckies", "text": "Lucky duckies\n\nLucky duckies is a term that was used in \"Wall Street Journal\" editorials starting on 20 November 2002 to refer to Americans who pay no federal income tax because they are at an income level that is below the tax line (after deductions and credits). The term has outlived its original use to become a part of the informal terminology used in the tax reform and income inequality debates in the United States.\n\nThe term's meaning has split depending on political persuasion. For many conservatives, the term has become part of a political theory that the USA is developing an increasingly large 'moocher' class who depend on government benefits paid for by taxes from richer or harder-working citizens, pay no taxes themselves and vote themselves higher benefits paid for from the taxes of others. This has led prominent conservative politicians such as Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann to propose that poorer citizens should have their taxes increased to make them more aware of the problems of excessive taxation and so-called big government. 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney commented that \"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote liberal no matter what ... believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That's an entitlement. The government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what ... 47% of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect ... I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" Perry, announcing his presidential campaign, commented \"Spreading the wealth punishes success ... we're dismayed at the injustice that nearly half of all Americans don't even pay any income tax.\"\n\nThe term was, meanwhile immediately criticised by liberals and some conservatives for suggesting that people are 'lucky' to be so poor that they are not eligible to pay tax. It has also been used to suggest that the WSJ and, by proxy, conservatives lack real awareness of poverty or intend to raise taxes on poor people for the benefit of richer taxpayers, a suggestion that has been described as 'reverse class warfare'. It has also been argued that as many red states are particularly poor, many individuals who pay no income tax are in fact generally conservative voters, while many rich residents of blue states consistently vote liberal.\n\nThe \"Journal\" defined the term in this way:\n\nWho are these lucky duckies? They are the beneficiaries of tax policies that have expanded the personal exemption and standard deduction and targeted certain voter groups by introducing a welter of tax credits for things like child care and education. When these escape hatches are figured against income, the result is either a zero liability or a liability that represents a tiny percentage of income.\n\nThe worry of the \"Journal\"'s editorialist was that \"as fewer and fewer people are responsible for paying more and more of all taxes, the constituency for tax cutting, much less for tax reform, is eroding. Workers who pay little or no taxes can hardly be expected to care about tax relief for everybody else. They are also that much more detached from recognizing the costs of government.\"\n\nFor example, according to the editorial:\n\nSay a person earns $12,000. After subtracting the personal exemption, the standard deduction and assuming no tax credits, then applying the 10% rate of the lowest bracket, the person ends up paying a little less than 4% of income in taxes. It ain't peanuts, but not enough to get his or her blood boiling with tax rage.\n\nThe \"Journal\" published three articles using the phrase \"lucky duckies\": \"The Non-Taxpaying Class\", the original article, on 20 November 2002; \"Lucky Duckies Again\" (20 January 2003); and \"Even Luckier Duckies\" (3 June 2003).\n\nIn recent years, the number and percentage of Americans who pay no federal income tax has increased. According to a 2007 report by the Statistics of Income division of the Internal Revenue Service, in 2006 the Internal Revenue Service received 134,372,678 individual income tax returns, of which 90,593,081 (67.42%) showed that they paid or owed federal income tax for 2005. That is, 32.58% of those Americans who filed income tax returns did not owe any federal income tax at all for 2005. This percentage increased substantially in 2008, and for 2009 was 47%.\n\nThe federal income tax is only one of several taxes Americans pay. Americans who pay zero federal income taxes do pay other taxes, such as payroll taxes (a.k.a. FICA), excise taxes, sales taxes, tariffs, gift taxes, unemployment taxes, state income taxes, property taxes, and self-employment taxes.\n\nFederal payroll taxes are imposed on nearly every American with income from employment (there are exceptions for certain students, certain religious objectors, and certain state/local government employees who participate in a state/local pension). Federal self-employment taxes are imposed on nearly every American with net income from self-employment above $400 (again with exceptions for certain religious objectors). So almost all Americans with some earned income do pay some federal taxes. However, the US also allows earned income tax credits to certain individuals, which can lower their income taxes below zero. When these refundable tax credits equal or exceed other federal taxes, the individual is said to pay \"no net federal taxes.\"\n\nAs of 2006, according to New York Times columnist David Leonhardt, approximately 10% of Americans paid no net federal taxes. Leonhardt did not have figures for 2010, and there were several refundable tax credits which were created or expanded between 2006 and 2010.\n\nAccording to Congressional Budget Office estimates, the lowest earning 20% of Americans (24.1 million households earning an average of $15,900 in 2005) paid an \"effective\" federal tax rate of 3.9%, when taking into account income tax, social insurance tax, and excise tax. For comparison, the same study found that the highest earning 1% of Americans (1.1 million households earning an average of $1,558,500 in 2005) paid an \"effective\" federal tax rate of 21.9%, when including the same three types of taxes.\n\nIn 2011, British financial journalist Ian Cowie argued that people who do not earn enough to pay tax should be stripped of the right to vote as they should not have the right to control how others' money is taxed and spent: \"Their contribution is not just negative in financial terms – they take out more than they put in – but likely to be damaging to the decisions taken by democracies.\" His colleague Benedict Brogan described the idea as 'intriguing' and 'worth checking out'.\n\nIn 2001, U.S. Representative Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) told \"The New Yorker\":\n\nI think we've got a major crisis in democracy ... We assume that voters will restrain the growth of government because it becomes burdensome to them personally. But today fewer and fewer people pay taxes, and more and more are dependent on government, so the politician who promises the most from government is likely to win. Every day, the Republican Party is losing constituents, because every day more people can vote themselves more benefits without paying for it. The tax code will destroy democracy, by putting us in a position where most voters don't pay for government.\n\nThe \"Journal\" was frequently mocked for its use of the term \"lucky duckies\" to refer to people whose lack of a federal income tax burden is the direct result of their lower income. This attitude was satirized as \"let them eat cake\"-style myopia.\n\nRuben Bolling's \"Tom the Dancing Bug\" comic in \"Salon\" magazine, for instance, periodically features a poor duck who keeps \"outwitting\" a fat, top-hatted oligarch by cleverly submitting to the misfortunes of his economic class.\n\nJonathan Chait, in \"The New Republic\", reacted to the \"Journal\" editorial by writing:\n\nOne of the things that has fascinated me about \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page is its occasional capacity to rise above the routine moral callousness of hack conservative punditry and attain a level of exquisite depravity normally reserved for villains in James Bond movies.\n\nAnd one \"lucky ducky\" wrote to the \"Journal\" editor, offering to share his luck (in a form of logical argument sometimes known as a modest proposal):\n\nI will spend a year as a \"Wall Street Journal\" editor, while one lucky editor will spend a year in my underpaid shoes. I will receive an editor's salary, and suffer the outrage of paying federal income tax on that salary. The fortunate editor, on the other hand, will enjoy a relatively small federal income tax burden, as well as these other perks of near poverty: the gustatory delights of a diet rich in black beans, pinto beans, navy beans, chickpeas and, for a little variety, lentils; the thrill of scrambling to pay the rent or make the mortgage; the salutary effects of having no paid sick days; the slow satisfaction of saving up for months for a trip to the dentist; and the civic pride of knowing that, even as a lucky ducky, you still pay a third or more of your gross income in income taxes, payroll taxes, sales taxes and property taxes.\n\nConservatives have also criticised the argument. Writing in 2011, Ramesh Ponnuru commented that \"conservatives should seek to remedy the problem by cutting benefits rather than by raising taxes in the hope it will make people more eager to cut benefits. To seek to raise taxes on poor and middle-class people would be a terrible mistake. The idea is bound to be unpopular. And it would alter the character of conservatism for the worse [into a] creed openly focused on helping one group at the expense of another, a kind of mirror image of egalitarian liberalism\".\n\nWriter W. James Antle said of the thresholds enabling poorer individuals to pay no income tax: \"Conservatives supported all of these policies ... [and the poor] are not exactly 'lucky duckies' ... it seems to me that a conservative vision of personal responsibility would entail having people living on subsistence-level incomes support themselves and their families before they support the government.\"\n\n\n"}

Originally a part of Morehouse College, the school became independent in 1981. The school abbreviates its name with its initials \"MSM.\"\n\nFounded as a part of Morehouse College in 1975 during the tenure of college president Hugh M. Gloster, with Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. as dean, the School of Medicine at Morehouse College began as a two-year program in the basic sciences. The first students were admitted in 1978 and transferred to other medical schools for the clinical years of their training.\n\nThe institution became independent from Morehouse College in 1981, with Sullivan as President, and was fully accredited to award M.D. degrees in 1985. Initially, third year clinical courses were taught by faculty from Emory University's School of Medicine, but since 1990 the school has taught them itself. In 1989, Sullivan was appointed United States Secretary of Health and Human Services by President George H.W. Bush. Sullivan served in that role for Bush's entire term, until 1993, when he returned to MSM to begin his second tenure as president.\n\nSullivan remained president until 2002. He now holds the title of President Emeritus.\n\nFormer US Surgeon General David Satcher served as director of the National Center for Primary Care at the Morehouse School of Medicine. He continued in that role while also serving as MSM's president from 2004 to 2006.\n\nOn February 28, 2006 Morehouse School of Medicine announced the appointment of John E. Maupin Jr., D.D.S. as the institution's next president. Maupin departed from his position of president at Meharry Medical College.\n\nValerie Montgomery Rice, M.D. was named the sixth president of the school and the first woman to lead the free-standing medical institution in July 2014. In addition to president, she also retains the deanship. Montgomery Rice is a renowned infertility specialist and researcher, and most recently served as dean and executive vice president of MSM, where she served since 2011. In this role, she led MSM’s widespread academic and clinical programs in health sciences and led its strategic planning initiatives for patient care, research and community engagement.\n\nOn February 3, 2009, Eric Holder, then-vice chairman of MSM's board of trustees, was confirmed as U.S. Attorney General.\n\nOn July 13, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Morehouse School of Medicine Trustee Regina Benjamin as U.S. Surgeon General. Benjamin's nomination and subsequent confirmation marks the second time a MSM trustee held a high-profile position with the Obama administration.\n\nA 2010 study ranked MSM as the number one medical school in the country in the terms of social mission. The social mission score used in the study evaluated schools on percentage of graduates who practice primary care, work in health professional shortage areas, and are underrepresented minorities.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced MSM will complete a $50 million expansion by 2020. The expansion will include its first-ever student housing, an ambulatory health-care center, additional parking, and a retail component.\n\n"}

He trained with his father Philipp (a portraitist and painter of animals) and his uncle, before going to the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1758. Later he traveled to Swedish Pomerania and Stockholm, where he painted murals.\n\nHe spent from 1765 to 1768 in Paris with the Swiss artist Balthasar Anton Dunker, where he focused on painting in gouache. He met and was inspired by Claude Joseph Vernet, who was already famous as a painter of landscapes and seascapes, and the German engraver Johann Georg Wille.\n\nIn 1768 Hackert left Paris with his brother Georg, and went to Italy, basing himself mainly in Rome and Naples, where he produced many works for Sir William Hamilton. He travelled all over Italy, gaining a reputation as a talented landscape painter. He became famous everywhere in Europe due to his works for Catherine the Great, the cycle of paintings about Battle of Chesma, and Pope Pius VI.\n\nIn 1786 he went to work for Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies in Naples. He advised on the creation of a painting restoration laboratory at the Museo di Capodimonte,suggesting the call from Rome to the court of Naples of the restorer and supervised the transfer of the Farnese collections from Rome to Naples. As court painter realised famous pictures of Caserta and the Royal Palace of Caserta, besides the paintings series of the Bourobon's ports.

The painters Salvatore Fergola and Salvatore Giusti were among his pupils.\n\nIn 1799, when Naples was declared the Parthenopaean Republic, Hackert lost much of his royal patronage. He moved to Pisa and then Florence. He bought an estate in San Pietro di Careggi, near Florence, and he died there in 1807 and was buried in the so-called \"Dutch garden\" of Livorno. His remains were then moved to the actual cemetery of the Dutch-German Congregation.\n\nHe never married and lived a good part of his life with one of his brothers but he had affairs with some married women, and from one of them he probably had a daughter.\n\nGoethe wrote the first biography of Hackert in 1811.\n\n"}

Schwarz–Christoffel mappings are used in potential theory and some of its applications, including minimal surfaces and fluid dynamics. They are named after Elwin Bruno Christoffel and Hermann Amandus Schwarz.\n\nConsider a polygon in the complex plane. The Riemann mapping theorem implies that there is a biholomorphic mapping \"f\" from the upper half-plane\nto the interior of the polygon. The function \"f\" maps the real axis to the edges of the polygon.

Salmon (August 9, 1925 – April 22, 2001) was an American philosopher of science renowned for his work on the nature of scientific explanation. He also worked on confirmation theory, trying to explicate how probability theory via inductive logic might help confirm and choose hypotheses. Yet most prominently, Salmon was a realist about causality in scientific explanation, although his realist explanation of causality drew ample criticism. Still, his books on scientific explanation itself were landmarks of the 20th century's philosophy of science, and solidified recognition of causality's important roles in scientific explanation, whereas causality itself has evaded satisfactory elucidation by anyone.\n\nUnder logical empiricism's influence, especially Carl Hempel's work on the \"covering law\" model of scientific explanation, most philosophers had viewed scientific explanation as stating regularities, but not identifying causes. To replace the covering law model's \"inductive-statistical model\" (IS model), Salmon introduced the \"statistical-relevance model\" (SR model), and proposed the criterion \"strict maximal specificity\" to supplement the covering law model's other component, the \"deductive-nomological model\" (DN model). Yet ultimately, Salmon held statistical models to be but early stages, and lawlike regularities to be insufficient, in scientific explanation. Salmon proposed that scientific explanation's manner is actually \"causal/mechanical explanation\".\n\nSalmon attended Wayne State University, then received a master's degree in 1947 from the University of Chicago. At UCLA, under Hans Reichenbach, Salmon earned a PhD in philosophy in 1950. He was on Brown University's faculty from 1955 until 1963, when he joined the History and Philosophy of Science Department of Indiana University Bloomington where Norwood Russell Hanson was Professor until he and his wife Merilee moved to Arizona in 1973. Salmon left the University of Arizona to join the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Philosophy, among the most prestigious, in 1981, where he was professor and chairperson until 1983 upon succeeding Carl Hempel as University Professor. Salmon retired in 1999.\n\nSalmon authored over 100 papers. For decades, his introductory textbook \"Logic\" was a standard, widely used, that went through multiple editions and was translated into several languages, including Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. Salmon was president of the Philosophy of Science Association from 1971 to 1972, and president of the American Philosophical Association's Pacific Division from 1977 to 1978. In 1988, at the University of Bologna, for its 900th anniversary, he gave a four-lecture series, \"Four decades of scientific explanation\", whereupon, taking Italian courses at University of Pittsburgh, Salmon mastered Italian and gave lectures at several other universities in Italy. From 1998 to 1999, he was president of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, sponsored by UNESCO. Salmon was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2001, traveling with his wife Merilee, also a philosopher of science, Wesley Salmon died suddenly in a car crash, though she was uninjured.\n\nStarting in 1983, Salmon became interested in theory choice in science, and sought to resolve the enduring conflict between the logical empiricist view, whereby theories undergo a logical process of confirmation and comparison, as against the Kuhnian historical perspective, whereby theory choice and comparison are troubled by incommensurability, the inability of scientists to even effectively communicate and compare theories across differing paradigms. Recognizing that Kuhn's 1962 thesis in \"Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" was largely misunderstood—that Kuhn had not meant that scientific theory change is irrational but merely relative to the scientific community where the change occurs—Salmon believed that Bayesianism, which quantifies decisionmaking via subjective probability or \"degree of belief\", could help close the seemingly unbridgeable gap between the logical empiricist view versus the Kuhnian historical view of theory choice and change.\n\nAccording to the empiricist view associated with the 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume, we do not actually observe causes and effects, but merely experience \"constant conjunction\" of sensory events, and impute causality between the observations. More precisely, one finds merely counterfactual causality—that altering condition A prevents or produces state B—but finds no further causal relation between A and B, since one has witnessed no either logical or natural necessity connecting A and B.\n\nIn the 20th century, as a formula to scientifically answer \"Why?\" questions, logical empiricist Carl Hempel and Paul Oppenheim explicated the deductive-nomological model (DN model). Concerning deterministic laws, the DN model characterizes scientific explanation as a logical form, whereby initial conditions plus universal laws entail an outcome via deductive inference, but no reference to causal relations. Concerning \"ceteris paribus\", which are probabilistic, not deterministic, Hempel introduced the inductive-statistical model (IS model). The IS model, too, indicates correlations, not causation.\n\nBy 1970, Salmon had found that when seeking to explain probabilistic phenomena, we seek not merely high probability, but screen for causal influence by removing components of a system to find ones that alter the probability. Salmon sought to replace Hempel's IS model with Salmon's statistical-relevance model (SR model).\n\nIn 1948 when explicating DN model, Carl Hempel and Paul Oppenheim had stated scientific explanation's semiformal \"conditions of adequacy\" (CA), but acknowledged redundancy of the third, \"empirical content\" (CA3), implied by the other three: \"derivability\" (CA1), \"lawlikeness\" (CA2), and \"truth\" (CA4). In the early 1980s, Salmon called for returning \"cause\" to \"because\", and helped replace CA3 \"empirical content\" with CA3' \"strict maximal specificity\". Yet ultimately, Salmon found mere modifications to the covering law model to be unsatisfactory.\n\nAs conventionally conceived by philosophers of science, scientific explanation of a phenomenon was simply epistemic (concerning knowledge), and centered on the phenomenon's counterfactual derivability from initial conditions plus natural laws (Hempel's covering law model). Yet Salmon found causality ubiquitous in scientific explanation, which identifies not only natural laws (empirical regularities), but accounts for them via nature's structure and thereby involves the ontic (concerning reality), how the phenomenon \"fits into the causal nexus\" of the world (Salmon's causal/mechanical explanation). For instance, Boyle's law relates temperature, pressure, and volume of an ideal gas (epistemic), but this was later reduced to laws of statistical mechanics via average kinetic energy of colliding molecules composing the gas (ontic). Thus, Salmon finds scientific explanation to be not merely \"nomological\"—that is, lawlike—but rather ontological, or \"causal/mechanical\". Though asserting the primacy of causal/mechanical explanation, Salmon was vague as to how scientists can attain it. Still, consensus among philosophers of science is that causation is central in scientific explanation.\n\nSalmon sought a \"process theory\" of causality to model \"causality without counterfactuals\", yet meet the \"Humean empirical strictures\". Salmon criticized Bertrand Russell's theory of \"causal lines\"—forerunner of today's theories of causal processes—for involving the epistemic but neglecting the ontic, which causation is. Further, Hans Reichenbach had noted that Russell's causal lines must be distinguished from \"unreal sequences\": continuous phenomena that actually are not causal processes. Salmon's explanation of causal processes drew a number of criticisms, whereupon Salmon explained that \"causal processes\" and \"causal interactions\" are \"the basic causal mechanisms\", while causal interactions are more fundamental than causal processes, but causal processes were discussed first for practical reasons.\n\nSalmon explained \"causal processes\" as \"the means by which causal influence is transmitted\", and thus what \"constitute precisely the objective physical causal connections which Hume sought in vain\". Salmon explained that causal processes can transmit a \"mark\" or can transmit \"structure\" in a way continuous spatiotemporally. Thereby, the \"marking principle\" sorts causal processes from \"pseudo processes\" (Reichenbach's \"unreal sequences\"). \"Marking\" a causal process modifies it, a mark not transmitted by a pseudo process. Meanwhile, \"causal forks\" are \"the means by which causal structure is generated and modified\". Others have found Salmon's theory of mark transmission to have shortcomings, however, whereby it can fail to discern causal processes from pseudo processes.\n\n\n\n"}

He was known as a physical defensive defenceman and a consummate bodychecker. As a coach, Flaman was successful at the collegiate ranks as the head coach of Northeastern University.\n\nAfter being signed by the Bruins in 1943 and playing three seasons for the minor-league Boston Olympics (during which time he was named to the Eastern Hockey League's First All-Star Team in 1945 and 1946), Flaman made the big club for good in the 1947 season. He played five seasons for Boston before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, with whom he won a Stanley Cup the year he was dealt in 1951.\n\nHe played three more seasons for Toronto before being dealt back to the Bruins in 1954 (in which he led the league in penalty minutes with 150), for whom he played seven more seasons. Those were his peak years, as he was named Bruins' captain in 1955 (and served as such for the rest of his NHL career), was named to three NHL Second All-Star Teams (1955, 1957 and 1958), and played in five All-Star Games.\n\nIn 1961, Flaman was named the player-coach-general manager of the AHL Providence Reds, retiring as an active player after the 1963–1964 season. He coached Providence for one more year after that, coaching teams in the Western Hockey League and the Central Hockey League thereafter. In 1970, Flaman was named the head coach of the Northeastern University Huskies men's college team, and coached for nineteen seasons (the longest tenure in school history), amassing a 256–301–24 record. He was named United States college coach of the year in 1982, and led the Huskies to four Beanpot Tournament championships and a Hockey East championship in 1988.

McDonald wrote and sang several hit singles with The Doobie Brothers, including \"What a Fool Believes\", \"Minute By Minute\", and \"Takin' It to the Streets\". McDonald has also performed as a prominent backing vocalist on numerous recordings by artists including Steely Dan, Christopher Cross, and Kenny Loggins. He is considered an influential figure in the development of the yacht rock genre.\n\nMcDonald's solo career consists of nine studio albums and a number of singles, including the 1982 hit \"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)\". During his career, McDonald has collaborated with a number of other artists, including James Ingram, David Cassidy, Van Halen, Patti LaBelle, Lee Ritenour, the Winans, Aretha Franklin, Toto, Grizzly Bear, Joni Mitchell, and Thundercat. He has also recorded for television and film soundtracks. McDonald is the recipient of five Grammy Awards, and will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Doobie Brothers in 2020.\n\nMichael McDonald was born on February 12, 1952, into an Irish American Catholic family in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. McDonald attended McCluer High School, where he played in local bands including Mike and the Majestics, Jerry Jay and the Sheratons, the Reeb-Toors/Younger Brothers, and the Guild. He was 'discovered' while playing with a band called Blue, and moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1970 to pursue a career in music.\n\nIn 1974, McDonald became a member of Steely Dan's touring band, singing lead and backing vocals. He also became one of the many in-studio adjunct members of the band, providing backing vocals on tracks for 1975's \"Katy Lied\". He appeared on subsequent Steely Dan recordings including 1976's \"The Royal Scam\" and 1977's \"Aja\". He also played keyboards on some Steely Dan tracks.\n\nMcDonald continued to provide backing vocals for Steely Dan through their 1980 release, \"Gaucho\". In 2006, he joined Steely Dan on the band's summer tour, both as the opening act and as part of the band.\n\nMcDonald was recruited by the rock band the Doobie Brothers in April 1975, initially as a temporary replacement for their lead vocalist Tom Johnston after he had become ill during a national tour, but his work with the band proved so successful that they decided to retain him as a full-time member.\n\nAs a member of the Doobie Brothers, McDonald sang the lead vocals on some of the band's best-known songs such as \"Real Love\", \"Takin' It to the Streets\", \"Little Darling (I Need You)\", \"It Keeps You Runnin'\", \"Minute by Minute\", and \"What a Fool Believes\" (which became a number-one single in the U.S. and earned him a 1980 Grammy Award for Song of the Year along with co-writer Kenny Loggins). At the same time, McDonald appeared as a session vocalist and keyboardist for various artists, including Christopher Cross, Stephen Bishop, Jack Jones, Bonnie Raitt, the rock band Toto, and Kenny Loggins. McDonald co-wrote \"You Belong to Me\" with Carly Simon, which appeared on the album \"Livin' on the Fault Line.\"\n\nMcDonald reunited as a guest performer with the Doobie Brothers several times since the band's initial dissolution in 1982. He reteamed with the Doobie Brothers for the track \"Don't Say Goodbye\" on the band's 13th studio album, \"World Gone Crazy\" (2010). In March 2014, he reunited with the Doobie Brothers to record a new album featuring the greatest hits of the Doobies' 40-plus-year career. This project was completed in conjunction with Sony Music Nashville. On the album, McDonald shares lead vocals with Sara Evans for \"What a Fool Believes\", Love and Theft for \"Takin' it to the Streets\", and Amanda Sudano-Ramirez for \"You Belong to Me\". The album, titled \"Southbound\", was released on November 4, 2014, as the Doobie Brothers' 14th studio album.\n\nOn November 5, 2014, McDonald and the Doobie Brothers were featured musical guests on the 47th annual Country Music Association Awards to celebrate the release of \"Southbound.\" They were joined by Hunter Hayes, Jennifer Nettles, and Hillary Scott in their performance of \"Listen to the Music.\" At the end of the awards ceremony, they were also joined by host Brad Paisley for \"Takin' It to the Streets\".\n\nAfter the Doobie Brothers' first farewell tour, McDonald released his first solo studio album, \"If That's What It Takes\", in 1982 on the label \nWarner Bros. The album featured the hit singles \"I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)\" and \"I Gotta Try\", the latter co-written with Kenny Loggins, who also recorded in that same year for his fourth album \"High Adventure\".\n\nHe continued to collaborate with other artists during this period. McDonald co-wrote Van Halen's top-20 hit \"I'll Wait\", from their biggest-selling album \"1984\". \"Yah Mo B There\", a duet with James Ingram, won the 27th Annual Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In 1985, he released his second studio album \"No Lookin' Back\", which for the first time, he coproduced, as well as wrote or cowrote all of the tracks and featured a minor hit with the title-track, cowritten by Kenny Loggins. By June 1986, the album had met little success, but McDonald then had a huge boost with the release of the single \"Sweet Freedom\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines film \"Running Scared\", and was McDonald's last top-10 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. The \"No Lookin' Back\" album was then re-released in some markets with the new hit single included, as well as a few songs remixed. The single \"On My Own\", a duet with Patti LaBelle, reached number one on the U.S. charts in 1986. Mid that year, he performed as a backing vocalist on Toto's album \"Fahrenheit\", appearing on the hit single \"I'll Be Over You\", and its accompanying video. On August 22, 1986, McDonald appeared in an episode of \"The Young and the Restless\". Later that year, he provided backing vocals on the Wang Chung song \"A Fool and His Money\" from their album \"Mosaic\". In 1987, McDonald did a featured collaboration with Gospel quartet the Winans from their \"Decisions\" album titled \"Love Has No Color\".\n\nIn 1990, McDonald released his third studio album, \"Take It to Heart\", which featured a minor hit with the title track, cowritten by Diane Warren. The following year, he joined the New York Rock and Soul Revue, put together by Steely Dan's lead vocalist Donald Fagen and featuring other artists such as Boz Scaggs and Phoebe Snow. In 1991, he released the single \"Ever Changing Times\", a duet with Aretha Franklin.\n\nIn 1999, McDonald recorded the song \"Eyes of a Child\" for the \"\", which is a comedic ballad written by Trey Parker.

He also provided lead vocals for one of three studio tracks on \".\"\n\nIn 2003, he earned two Grammy nominations for his album \"Motown,\" a tribute to the Motown sound. A year later, \"Motown Two\" was released. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated, \"The album follows the same blueprint as the first record, offering highly polished, professionally produced, expertly performed interpretations of gems from the Motown vaults.\"\n\nIn 2008, McDonald released his album \"Soul Speak\", which includes three new songs penned by McDonald, and covers of songs by Dionne Warwick (\"Walk On By\"), Stevie Wonder (\"Living for the City\"), Van Morrison (\"Into the Mystic\"), Tyrone Davis (\"Baby Can I Change My Mind\") and others.\n\nIn 2000, McDonald, along with partners Chris Pelonis and actor Jeff Bridges, founded the independent recording label Rampe St. Louis Walk of Fame. McDonald recorded a duet with Ray Charles on Charles' 2004 \"Genius Loves Company\". In 2007, McDonald helped judge the sixth annual Independent Music Awards.

McDonald also contributed an alternate lead vocal track for \"While You Wait for the Others\", a single by the indie rock band Grizzly Bear, which released as a 7-inch single.\n\nIn December 2009, McDonald donated his performance to Keep the Beat in Santa Barbara, California, where he played to a capacity crowd at the newly renovated Granada Theater. Harry Rabin, producer and head of Keep the Beat, an initiative of the Santa Barbara Education Foundation, produced the show, including two video productions and worked with student choral groups from primary and secondary schools as well as a brass section so they could perform in the show with McDonald and his band.\n\nIn 2009, McDonald appeared on the satirical television sitcom \"30 Rock\" as one of the benefit singers in the season finale episode \"Kidney Now!\". McDonald performed the national anthem before the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl between the Boise State Broncos and TCU Horned Frogs at the University of Phoenix Stadium on January 4, 2010 in Glendale, Arizona. McDonald sang \"Takin' It to the Streets\" on the \"American Idol\", season nine finale, in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, McDonald teamed up again with Donald Fagen and Boz Scaggs to form The Dukes of September. In June 2012, the supergroup performed on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\" to promote their tour. The group also played at Lincoln Center, a performance which was then broadcast as a PBS special and later released on DVD.\n\nIn 2013, McDonald settled a $500,000 breach-of-contract suit (out of court) with Warner Music over underpayment of royalties of online sales. In the summer of 2014, he co-headlined a U.S. tour with the band Toto.\n\nIn 2017, McDonald was featured together with Kenny Loggins on Thundercat's single \"Show You the Way\", included on the latter's album \"Drunk\".

They have two children, Dylan (born 1987), and Scarlett (born 1991). He moved with his family to Santa Barbara, California in the late 1990s, and has subsequently lived in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\nIn May 2011, Michael McDonald was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.\n\nA fictionalized version of McDonald (portrayed by actor JD Ryznar) appeared in the online Channel 101 video series \"Yacht Rock\". McDonald was parodied in a Second City Television skit in the early 1980s, where he is portrayed by Rick Moranis.\n\nIn the 2005 comedy \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\", the manager of the electronics store has a fondness for McDonald and insists on repeatedly playing one of his live concerts on the big-screen televisions all day for two years straight, driving her employees crazy.\n\nIn the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Padre de Familia,\" McDonald is hired by Peter Griffin as a backup singer during a night of patrolling Quahog.\n\nIn \"The Cleveland Show\", McDonald is Cleveland's neighbor on Grace Street and can be seen in the episodes \"Skip Day\" and \"Mama Drama\".\n\nOn March 13, 2013, McDonald appeared in a segment on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\". McDonald, Fallon and Justin Timberlake sang \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" in the round, with Fallon and Timberlake sporting McDonald's trademark white hair and emulating his distinct vocal style.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990819", "title": "Safmarine", "text": "Safmarine\n\nSafmarine (\"Safmarine Container Lines N.V.\") is an international shipping business offering container and break-bulk shipping services worldwide.\n\nFormed in 1946 by South African industrialists and American ship owners, Safmarine is now widely known as a north/south trade and African specialist. The line is represented in more than 130 countries throughout the world, with more than 1200 sailors selling their services. Safmarine had been headquartered and registered in Antwerp, Belgium, since 1996, when it completed its acquisition of the Belgian container line, CMBT, which in turn had been an outgrowth of CMB. In 1999, Safmarine was bought by the Danish company A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, and Maersk chose to retain the Safmarine brand rather than integrating it wholly into Maersk Sealand. In 2002, Safmarine acquired Torm Lines.\n\nOn October 3, 2011, it was decided that Safmarine would integrate its internal support and management functions into those of its sister company Maersk Line.\n\nSafmarine operated a passenger liner service between the United Kingdom and South Africa between 1965 and 1977 and again between 1984 and 1985.\n\nSafmarine passenger operations had begun in 1965, when two Union-Castle Line ships used on the Southampton–Durban service, and \"Pretoria Castle\", were transferred to Safmarine to satisfy demands from the South African government. The ships were renamed \"S. A. Vaal\" and \"S. A. Oranje\" respectively, re-painted in Safmarine colours but continued on the same service as before. In 1969, both vessels were transferred from British to South African registry. During the 1970s the South African liner trade started to decline, mainly due to competition from the jet airplane and the rising success of the revolutionary new container ships, in carrying cargoes more efficiently and more economically than conventional, older vessels. Thus, in 1975 the \"S. A. Oranje\" and her Union-Castle sister RMS \"Edinburgh Castle\" were withdrawn and sold for scrapping. RMS \"Pendennis Castle\" was also withdrawn in June 1976, leaving \"S. A. Vaal\" to remain with Union-Castle's , and the two smaller cargo/passenger mailships RMMV \"Good Hope Castle\" and RMMV \"Southampton Castle\". In October 1977, both companies withdrew their passenger services and \"S. A. Vaal\" was sold to Carnival Cruise Lines, becoming their .\n\nIn 1984, Safmarine purchased the cruise ship from the West German Hadag Cruise Lines. Following refit she was used to revive the Southampton–Cape Town service, also making cruises out of South Africa and the United Kingdom between liner voyages. However, in service the \"Astor\" was found not to have enough speed to maintain the liner schedule and Safmarine ordered a replacement ship based on the same design from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Kiel, also to be named . In preparation for the delivery of the new ship, the first \"Astor\" was sold to the East German Deutsche Seerederei via a West German intermediary, becoming MS Arkona. Ultimately the second \"Astor\" never entered service for Safmarine, as the company abandoned the liner service in 1986. The second \"Astor\", still under construction at the time, was sold to Marlan Corporation in January 1986.\n\nSafmarine purchased three Victory ships (\"SS Westbrook Victory\", \"SS Westerly Victory\", \"SS New Bern Victory\") from the USA and, after modifications to convert them from war use to general dry cargo, they entered service in 1947. They were named \"Vergelegen\", \"Morgenster\" and \"Constantia\". These three ships enabled Safmarine to start a South Africa-based cargo enterprise. In 1961, their names were changed to \"South African Victory\", \"South African Venture\" and \"South African Vanguard\". In 1966, the prefix \"South African\" on all Safmarine's ships was changed to \"S.A.\" In the engine rooms there were two Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers supplying superheated steam to two Westinghouse turbines geared down to a single shaft, giving and a speed of . For electrical power, two steam turbines drove DC generators.\n\nThe next four sister ships to be brought into service were \"South African Trader\", \"South African Pioneer\", \"South African Transporter\" and \"South African Merchant\". They were designed for carrying general dry cargo and had berths for twelve passengers. All were built in Scotland and entered service in the mid-1950s. Each ship had were two Yarrow water-tube boilers and two Parson type turbines geared down to a single shaft, giving approximately and a speed of . For electrical power, three Ruston Hornsby diesel engines drove DC generators.\n\nIn 1961, \"South African Statesman\", \"South African Seafarer\", and \"South African Shipper\" joined the fleet. They were designed for carrying general dry cargo, and were built in Scotland in the 1950s for the Clan Line then the Springbok Shipping Co. These ships had a distinctive cowl top on the funnel and were fitted with Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers and three Parson type turbines geared down to a single shaft, giving approximately and a speed of . Electrical power came from generators driven by three Ruston Hornsby diesel engines.\n\nThree refrigerated motor ships \"S.A. Langkloof\", \"S.A. Zebediela\", and \"S.A. Hexrivier\" were built to export temperature controlled fruit from South Africa to the UK and Europe. They were built in Dutch yards and entered service in early to mid-1960s. They were powered by an eight-cylinder MAN K8Z70/120 low speed two-stroke diesel engine developing approximately 9,600 BHP and a speed of . For electrical power, four MAN diesel engines drove AC alternators.\n\nThree further ships, \"S.A. Letaba\", \"S.A. Tzaneen\" and \"S.A. Drakenstein\" were built in Scotland, entering service in the mid-1960s. They had the same hull design as the Dutch-built ships but used B&W engines at approximately 9,650 BHP.\n\nThe following three sister ships were the heavy lift vessels in the Safmarine fleet, also for carrying general cargo. The S.A. \"Van Der Stel\", S.A. \"Weltevreden\", and the S.A. \"Nederburg\". were all built by a Dutch company, and entered service in the mid-1960s. The S.A. \"Van Der Stel\" could lift 250 tons with her own derricks and the other two could lift 125 tons. They were all powered by a six-cylinder MAN K6Z86/160 low-speed two-stroke diesel engine, developing approximately 14,000 BHP and a speed of 21 knots. For electrical power three MAN diesel engines drove AC alternators.\nThese ships were modified in Japan in 1975/1976. An additional hold specially designed for containers approximately 100' long was added amidships. A new heavy lift derrick was added and loading points were added on deck for container mounting.\n\nA further sister ship, the S.A. \"Vergelegen\" was commissioned in 1969 had a 250 Stulken heavy lift and the number 3/4 and 5/6 holds had been extended. She was last known as the \"Virgil\" prior to being decommissioned after 1987.\n\nS.A. \"Nederburg\" was decommissioned in 1987 after leaving Durban harbour via Australia to the Far East to be dismantled.\n\nThese were the last of the dry cargo ships to be built in the 1960s for Safmarine. The \"S.A. Alphen\" and \"S.A. Huguenot\" came into service in the mid-1960s, and later the \"S.A. Constantia\", \"S.A. Morgenster\", and the \"S.A. Vergelegen\" were built of the same design in Japan.\nS.A. Vergelegen was later modified in Germany with a Stulken derrick capable of lifting 250 tons. This class of vessel had the most pleasing lines of all the dry cargo ships built for the corporation. They were powered by a six-cylinder Sulzer 6RND90 two-stroke diesel engine developing 15,000 BHP giving them a speed of 21 knots. For electrical power two eight-cylinder and two six-cylinder MAN diesel engines drove AC alternators.\n\nSafmarine had eight of its newest dry cargo ships lengthened to carry a small number of containers. Now was the time for Safmarine to get into the container business which was starting to change the way that cargo was transported all round the world.\n\nAn order was placed with French ship building yards to build four large container ships with all the latest designs & technology that was available at that time. They were all completed between 1977 & 1978.\n\nThey were named \"S.A. Helderberg\" \"S.A. Sederberg\" \"S.A. Waterberg\" & \"S.A. Winterberg\". These ships were fitted with two large diesel engines; two bow thrusters; stabilisers & full air conditioning which included the engine control room. There was also luxury accommodation for ten passengers.\n\nEarly in their service they were affectionately called \"The Big Whites\" because of their large size and gleaming white hulls that reflected the African sun, on their regular calls to South African ports. Their specifications were as follows:\nWhen they were built they had Crepelle V16 diesel generators (which ran on diesel fuel) fitted which proved to be very unreliable. They were later replaced with 6 cylinder Wartsila engines that ran on heavy fuel oil (bunker C) the same as the main engines.\n\nThe main engines were adapted with a large generator so that when running at cruising speed these generators produced a large amount of electrical energy, which made these ships more fuel efficient.\n\nSafmarine was bought out by Maersk in 1999. Present Safmarine ships under Maersk include the N Class Vessels (Safmarine Nile, Nuba, Nakuru etc.), K Class vessels, M Class vessels and C Class vessels.\n\n\n"}

The line has 18 ships cruising global itineraries that are marketed to both American and international passengers.\n\nThe company was made famous by the American television series \"The Love Boat\", in which its ship \"Pacific Princess\" was featured. In May 2013, \"Royal Princess\", the first \"Royal\"-class ship and the largest ship constructed for Princess at the time, became the flagship of Princess Cruises.\n\nPrincess Cruises began in 1965, when founder Stanley McDonald chartered Canadian Pacific Limited's Alaska cruise ship \"Princess Patricia\" for Mexican Riviera cruises from Los Angeles during a time when she would have usually been laid up for the winter. However, \"Princess Pat\", as she was fondly called, had never been designed for tropical cruising, lacking air-conditioning, and Princess ended her charter in favor of a more purpose-built cruise ship \"Italia\".\n\nPrincess, who marketed the ship as \"Princess Italia\", but never officially renamed her, used the ship to inaugurate their Mexican Riviera cruises out of Los Angeles and did not receive the Princess logo on her funnel until 1967.\n\nIn 1969, \"Princess Italia\" was used on Alaskan cruises from San Francisco, but by 1973, the charter was canceled, and \"Italia\" returned to Europe on charter to Costa Cruise Line.\n\nPrincess's third charter ship was none other than Costa's \"Carla C\". Originally, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique's SS \"Flandre\", the ship had been purchased by Costa in the late 1960s and given a major rebuilding. Almost immediately after completion, the ship was chartered to Princess, and it was on board the ship, which was marketed as, but again not officially renamed, \"Princess Carla\", that Jeraldine Saunders wrote the first chapters of her nonfiction book \"The Love Boats.\"\n\nBritain's Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), which by 1960 was the world's largest shipping company, with 320 oceangoing vessels, acquired Princess Cruise Lines in 1974 and their \"Spirit of London\" (originally to have been Norwegian Cruise Line's \"Seaward\") was transferred to the Princess fleet, becoming the first \"Sun Princess\".\n\nThe two ships that were to be featured heavily in the television series \"The Love Boat\" were built in 1971 at Nordseewerke for Flagship Cruises and originally named the \"Sea Venture\" (for the original \"Sea Venture\", the 1609 wreck of which resulted in the settlement of Bermuda) and \"Island Venture\". In 1974, P&O purchased them for their Princess division, and they served as \"Island Princess\" and \"Pacific Princess\" respectively.\n\nA part-time addition to the Princess fleet was the former Swedish transatlantic liner \"Kungsholm\", purchased by P&O from Flagship Cruises in 1978, and then restyled and rebuilt in Bremen as \"Sea Princess\". She was initially based in Australia as a P&O ship until 1981 when her role there was taken over by \"Oriana\". After that, she alternated between P&O and Princess colours as she moved between fleets. \"Sea Princess\" returned to the P&O UK fleet permanently and in 1995 and was renamed MV \"Victoria\" to allow a then-new Princess ship to be named \"Sea Princess\".\n\nIn 1981, Princess began calling at the cruise line's first private Caribbean destination, Palm Island in the Grenadines.\n\nThe first P&O Princess Cruises purpose-built cruise ship was \"Royal Princess\" in 1984, the largest new British passenger ship in a decade, and one of the first, if not the first, ships to completely dispense with interior cabins. The ship served in P&O Cruises fleet as \"Artemis\" until 2011.\n\nIn 1986, P&O Princess Cruises acquired Tour Alaska, which operated on the Alaska Railroad. Based in Anchorage, Alaska, Princess Tours now operates ten luxury railcars with full-service scenic tours of Denali (formerly Mount McKinley) and can accommodate over 700 passengers per day. That same year, Princess unveiled Princess Bay, located at Saline Bay on the Caribbean island of Mayreau. Princess Bay was the cruise line's second private island resort, replacing Palm Island, and was marketed as \"every castaway's first choice,\" primarily featured on the cruise line's Caribbean itineraries from San Juan, Puerto Rico, but is now no longer a Princess private resort.\n\nP&O Princess Cruises acquired Sitmar Line in 1988 and transferred all of its major tonnage to Princess, including three cruise ships then under construction. \"Dawn Princess\" and \"Fair Princess\" were both ex-Cunard, and the former Sitmar \"Fairsky\" became Princess's \"Sky Princess\". The first of the three new Sitmar ships came into the Princess brand in 1989 as \"Star Princess\", the largest British exclusively cruising ship. Two 70,000 GT cruise ships entered service in 1990 as \"Crown Princess\" and \"Regal Princess\", bringing Princess's fleet up to ten deluxe cruise ships.\n\nIn 1991, Princess Cruises began developing their third ever Caribbean private resort named Princess Cays located on the southern tip of the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The development was reported to cost $1.2 million and was unveiled in 1992, becoming an exclusive port of call for the cruise line's Western Caribbean itineraries. The private destination is also shared between sister brands, Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line. The resort suffered from a fire in January 2019 that damaged several buildings along the south side of the island.\n\nPrincess Cruises was involved in litigation with General Electric in 1998 over consequential damages and lost profits resulting from a contract the two parties entered into. General Electric was to provide inspection and repair services upon the SS \"Sky Princess\". Upon noticing surface rust on the turbine rotor, the vessel was brought ashore for cleaning and balancing, but good metal was unintentionally removed. This destabilized the rotor, forcing Princess Cruises to cancel two 10-day cruises while additional work was performed. Princess originally prevailed, being awarded nearly $4.6 million. On appeal, however, the judgement was reversed in favor of General Electric, and Princess Cruises only recovered the price of the contract, less than $232,000.\n\nThat same year, Princess unveiled its first \"Grand\"-class vessel, the \"Grand Princess\", which debuted on May 26. At the time, the $450 million Fincantieri-built vessel was the largest passenger ship ever commissioned and completed. Two more ships in the class, \"Golden Princess\" and \"Star Princess,\" followed, pioneering the design that carried on through the following six vessels in the class, with the last ship delivered in 2008.\n\nOn October 23, 2000, the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) spun-off its passenger division to form an independent company, P&O Princess Cruises. In 2001, Princess Cruises headquarters moved from Century City to Santa Clarita, California.\n\nWith the debut of \"Golden Princess\" in North America in 2001, \"Sky Princess\" was deployed to Australia for P&O Cruises Australia in 2000 and replace \"Fair Princess. Sky Princess\" was transformed into \"Pacific Sky\" to become the sister brand's first modern-era cruise ship for the recently spun off P&O Cruises Australia. \"Star Princess\" commenced operations in March 2002 and became the first \"mega-ship\" to operate from the West Coast on a full-time basis. In June 2002, \"Crown Princess\" was transferred to P&O Princess' new start-up brand, A'Rosa Cruises, to be the only cruise ship in A'Rosa's fleet to help launch the brand.\n\nP&O Princess Cruises merged with Carnival Corporation on April 17, 2003, to form the world's largest cruise operating company in a deal worth US$5.4 billion. As a result of the merger, Carnival Corporation and P&O Princess were integrated to form Carnival Corporation & plc, with a portfolio of eleven cruise ship brands. It is a dual-listed company, registered in both the United States and the United Kingdom, with the former P&O Princess Cruises being relisted as Carnival plc, more commonly known as Carnival UK, which holds executive control over Cunard Line and P&O Cruises. As an American-based company, executive control of Princess Cruises was transferred to Carnival's American operations, with the formation of the Holland America Group umbrella, which comprises Princess, Holland America Line, Seabourn Cruise Line, and P&O Cruises Australia.\n\nIn May 2005, Princess reacquired \"Sea Princess\" from P&O, which it had transferred over just two years prior.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival Corporation & plc, stated that due to the low value of the United States dollar because of the recession, inflation and high shipbuilding costs, the company would not be ordering any new ships for their U.S.-based brands (Princess, Carnival Cruise Line, and Holland America Line) before the economic situation improved.\n\nIn May 2010, Carnival Corporation & plc signed a contract with Fincantieri for the construction of two new 3,600-passenger ships, known as the \"Royal-\"class cruise ships, for Princess Cruises. The \"Royal\"-class vessels are the largest ships ever constructed for Princess. \"Royal Princess\", Princess' new flagship vessel, entered service in 2013. In 2017, Princess further invested in China via the delivery of their third \"Royal\"-class ship, \"Majestic Princess\", after it was designed to accommodate the Chinese-speaking market and scheduled to homeport in Shanghai. Following the delivery of \"Sky Princess\" in October 2019, Princess has the last two \"Royal\"-class ships set for delivery in 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\nIn July 2018, Princess signed a memorandum of agreement with Fincantieri for the construction of two new 175,000 GT ships that will be primarily powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). The ships will become the largest vessels built in Italy and commissioned for Princess as well as the first in the fleet to run on LNG. The final contract was signed in March 2019, ushering in the development of the ships. Princess will become the fifth Carnival Corporation brand to operate ships running on LNG upon the first ship's delivery in late-2023.\n\nIn 2020, Princess will part ways with a \"Grand\"-class ship, \"Golden Princess\", for the first time, as she transfers to P&O Cruises Australia, debuting in their fleet in October 2020. \"Star Princess\", the second \"Grand\"-class ship to leave, will transfer to the same cruise line and debut in November 2021.\n\nOn August 26, 2013, the crew of \"Caribbean Princess\" deliberately discharged 4,227gallons of oil-contaminated waste off the southern coast of England. The discharge involved the illegal modification of the vessel's on-board pollution control systems, and was photographed by a newly hired engineer. When the ship subsequently berthed at Southampton, the engineer resigned his position and reported the discharge to the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency. An investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) found that the practice had been taking place on \"Caribbean Princess\" and four other Princess ships – \"Star Princess\", \"Grand Princess\", \"Coral Princess\", and \"Golden Princess\" – since 2005.\n\nIn December 2016, Princess agreed to plead guilty to seven felony charges and pay a $40 million penalty. The charges related to illegal discharges off the coasts of Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. As part of the agreement, cruise ships from eight Carnival companies, including Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America Line, are required to operate for five years under a court-supervised environmental compliance plan with independent audits and a court-appointed monitor. The fine was the \"largest-ever criminal penalty involving deliberate vessel pollution.\"\n\nFor violation of the probation terms of 2016, Carnival Corporation and Princess were ordered to pay an additional $20 million penalty in 2019. The new violations included discharging plastic into waters in the Bahamas, falsifying records, and interfering with court supervision.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, several ships from the cruise line became major clusters of infection of the disease, including \"Diamond Princess\" and \"Ruby Princess,\" spreading it around the world. By February, 712 cases had developed on \"Diamond Princess,\" of which 11 eventually died. This drew worldwide attention and led to several countries repatriating their citizens from the ship. Shortly before the disease was declared a pandemic, and with over 2700 passengers on board, \"Ruby Princess\" sailed into international waters despite a global increase of confirmed cases of COVID-19. By mid April, there were 852 confirmed cases among Australian passengers alone, and 21 deaths. The subsequent discharge of infected passengers into Australia worsened the national pandemic in the country and caused a humanitarian crisis.\nOn April 5, 2020 the New South Wales Police Force announced they had launched a criminal investigation into whether the operator of the \"Ruby Princess\" downplayed potential coronavirus cases before thousands of passengers disembarked in Sydney.\n\nAll \"Grand\"-class ships are classified as New Panamax-type; as of 2016, access through the Panama Canal for these ships are now facilitated by the newly opened Agua Clara locks. \nThese two ships each have a capacity of 1,990 passengers and 924 crew.\nThis ship has a capacity of 680 passengers and 373 crew.\n\n"}

It was originally performed by the group nearly a decade before in 1964 (released as \"Who's That Lady?\") inspired by The Impressions. After signing with Epic Records in 1973, the eldest members of the group (O'Kelly Isley, Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley) had included younger members, guitarist Ernie Isley, bassist Marvin Isley and keyboardist/pianist Chris Jasper, as official members. In a response to this transformation, the group gave themselves the moniker of \"3 + 3\", describing the three original vocalists in the group and three recruited instrumentalists, inspiring the title of the album that came out that year. They performed the song on \"Soul Train\" on September 22, 1973.\n\nThe group entered the studio to remake \"Who's That Lady?\" after being inspired by rock acts such as Carlos Santana (who himself covered it on his 1990 album \"Spirits Dancing in the Flesh\") bringing a Latin percussive rock feel to it, including congas and an organ solo by assorted other musicians while the other Isleys played various instrumentation. The two youngest Isley brothers and in-law Jasper re-wrote the instrumental while the older brothers revamped their harmonies, with Ronald's vocal smoother than the original version. Brother Ernie Isley's Jimi Hendrix/Santana-inspired guitar solo was one of the elements that defined the \"3 + 3\" era of the Isleys, and the song became their first Top 10 pop single since 1969's \"It's Your Thing\" peaked at #2 on the pop singles chart, reaching #6 on the pop chart and #2 on the US R&B Singles chart. It was also a cross-Atlantic hit for the group, reaching #14 in the UK.\n\nThe song is ranked #357 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\nIn 2001, instrumentalist Peter White covered the song in his album \"Glow.\"\n\nRapper Kendrick Lamar sampled the song on the track \"i\", released in 2014 as a single from his 2015 album \"To Pimp a Butterfly\".\n\nThe rap group Beastie Boys sampled the song on their 1989 album \"Paul's Boutique\", in the song \"A Year and a Day\", which was a solo track performed by MCA.\n\nSmooth Jazz guitarist Patrick Yandall recorded an instrumental cover of the song on his 2019 album “When It’s Hip”.\n"}

{"id": "1990831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990831", "title": "Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus", "text": "Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus\n\nPastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus (1996) is the first science fiction novel in a proposed \"Pastwatch\" series by Orson Scott Card. The book's focus is the life and activities of explorer, Christopher Columbus. Much of the action deals with a group of scientists from the future who travel back to the 15th century in order to change the pattern of European contact with the Americas. These alternate with chapters describing Columbus' career and his efforts to obtain backing to his project of travelling across the ocean - much of which can be considered as simple historical fiction.\n\nSometime in the future, humanity invents a series of machines which allow them to view events in their past. Tagiri is a researcher at Pastwatch, the organization in charge of these machines. Her special interest is in the colonization of the Caribbean and the life of Christopher Columbus. One day she accidentally discovers that the machines may be used to send information backwards in time. Unsure about what to do with this knowledge she is nonetheless put in charge of a project to explore it along with her husband Hassan. They are eventually joined by their daughter Diko.\n\nA parallel narrative tells of Columbus' efforts to secure financial and political backing for his voyage across the Atlantic. Tagiri and other researchers note that Columbus had always yearned for greatness but that as a young man he had been determined to head east in a new Crusade to liberate from the Muslims the Holy Land as well as Constantinople, whose fall was a recent and painful event to Europeans of Columbus' generation. Columbus only changed his mind and decided to head west across the Atlantic after nearly drowning in a storm.\n\nThe mystery of exactly why Columbus changed his mind is solved by Diko. She uses a new, and more visually sensitive, version of the time viewer and discovers that after surviving the wreck Columbus received a vision directing him to head west to convert the people who lived on a previous undiscovered continent. The researchers realize that this vision is actually a hologram sent back in time by people from an alternate timeline in order to influence the direction of Columbus' life.\n\nRealizing that someone has already changed the timeline they try to figure out what might have been different if Columbus had headed east instead of west. The answer is provided by Hunahpu, an Amerindian researcher with Pastwatch. He argues that in the original timeline, the Europeans exhausted themselves in the anti-Muslim crusade propagated by Columbus, and meanwhile across the ocean the Tlaxcalan Empire of Central America grew powerful enough to invade the weakened Europe, subjecting the continent to a harsh regime of human sacrifice. Eventually, the Tlaxcalans underwent an Industrial Revolution and developed advanced weapons which enabled them to conquer the entire world - still without changing their bloodthirsty religion. In order to undo that atrocity, the Pastwatch's counterparts from the original timeline sent the hologram back to direct Columbus, the greatest man of his era, to head west. The European conquest of the Americas thereby neutralized the threat - but at the price of untold suffering for the Native Americans, trampled under the European conquest.\n\nTagiri and her team determine that they must change history so that neither timeline happens as it did. The urgency of doing so increases when Tagiri's world goes into an ecological disaster of untold proportions, which threatens the very survival of humanity. Tagiri and the others reason that the ruthless plundering of the world's resources which led to the disaster was a continuation of the dynamic of ruthless European conquest of the Americas, and averting the one might avert the other as well. In any case, with the world on the brink of total disaster, there is little to lose in interfering with history and trying to change and improve it.\n\nTagiri's team use their machinery to send Diko, Hunahpu, and a Turkish researcher named Kemal, back in time in order to change history. Hunahpu and Diko appear years before Columbus' voyage in Central America and the Caribbean respectively. They use genetically-engineered viruses to spread immunity to Old World diseases and work to strengthen Indian society for the coming European contact, including by spreading a pseudo-Christian religion among them and outlawing human sacrifice. Hunahpu helps accelerate the development of a Central American empire to rival European powers. When Columbus arrives, Kemal sinks his ships, stranding the explorer and his men in the Caribbean. After overcoming prejudice, Columbus learns to live with the indigenous people and becomes a powerful political leader among the natives of the Caribbean and eventually oversees a political union with the Central American empire.\n\nDiko becomes Columbus' lover and the two establish a strong, lasting loving relationship. After years of their knowing and trusting each other, Diko reveals to Columbus the truth about her origins and what she had done. When hearing about how his voyage of discovery would have led to the widespread killing and enslavement of the Indians, Columbus bursts out crying and thanks Diko for saving him from perpetrating such deeds.\n\nBy the sixteenth century, the people of Central America and the Caribbean are able to send ships across the Atlantic to meet the Europeans on more equal footing. Neither Europeans nor Native Americans are in a position to conquer the other, and they embark on reasonably peaceful relations.\n\nA postscript describes the future of this new timeline as a utopian one and how archeologists in the 1950s discovered the skull of Kemal and found within it a set of small metal plates which contained a message from Tagiri and the Pastwatch program.\n\nAccording to Card at his Hatrack River website, a second and third book, \"Pastwatch: The Flood\" and \"Pastwatch: The Garden of Eden\" are planned:\n\nIn a 1999 interview with CNN, Card confirmed that those stories would be part of a \"\"Pastwatch\" series\".\n\nIn 2010 Card stated in an interview that he would be writing a Pastwatch novel a year until the trilogy was completed. As of 2016, this has not occurred and Card is instead working on his last book of the \"Pathfinder\" trilogy (\"Visitors\"), with next to be the two last books of the \"Ender\" series (\"Shadows Alive\" and \"Fleet School\").\n\n\n\n"}

Half of the novel is historical fiction based on the Smuttynose Island murders, which took place in 1873.\n\nThe book was adapted for a film of the same name, directed by Kathryn Bigelow and released in 2000.\n\nIn March 1873, two Norwegian-born women who lived on the desolate Smuttynose Island, one of the Isles of Shoals off the coast of Maine and New Hampshire, were brutally murdered. Maren Hontvedt, a sister of one of the victims, survived by hiding in a sea cave until dawn. The murdered women were her older sister Karen Christensen and Anethe Christensen, their sister-in-law. A man named Louis Wagner was tried and hanged for their murders, mostly on circumstantial evidence. His conviction has been argued about, as some people think he could not have done it.\n\nMore than a century later, Jean Janes, a magazine photographer working on a photo essay about the murders, returns to the Isles with her husband Thomas and five-year-old daughter. Thomas is an award-winning poet who has been struggling with alcoholism and not writing much. Hoping to have a small vacation, they travel on a boat skippered by Thomas' brother Rich, who has brought along his girlfriend Adaline.\n\nJean becomes immersed in the details of the 19th-century murders after discovering a purported memoir of Maren in the library.

The song is notable for the usage of the word \"bullshit\", which was censored during radio listens.\n\nThe song was sparked in a 1975 recording session in which guitarist Ernie Isley, inspired by the news, wrote two songs: \"Fight the Power\" and an anti-poverty ballad titled \"Harvest for the World\". The group ended up recording both songs on the same day and eventually picked \"Fight the Power\" as the song to release first. \"Harvest\" would be featured on the album of the same name and would be released as the first single off that album.\n\nThe song was written almost fully by Ernie Isley with additional instrumental background composition by the band's keyboardist Chris Jasper. After playing the track on his guitar to his older brothers, Ronnie, Rudy, and O'Kelly, the vocal trio cut a unison lead vocal track in one take. Ernie was taken aback that Ron had uttered \"bullshit\". When asked why he said the word, Ron simply replied, \"because it needed to be said\" and \"it's what people want to hear.\"\n\nThe song reflected a negative opinion of authority figures, a feeling shared by all the band members, which can explain the intensified vocalizing by Ron, Rudy, and Kelly. Later, the trio added in the background chant, \"fight it!\" to merge in with the brothers' vocal ad-libbing near the end. Though the track had a unison lead style, onstage during performances, Ron Isley would sing the majority of the song with his older brothers chipping in during some parts. As was with the majority of their recordings during the so-called \"3+3\" era, Ernie Isley and Chris Jasper had to share composition and lyrical credit with the other Isley members.\n\nThe song was released in May 1975 and became one of the group's most popular recordings, reaching #1 on the R&B singles chart and crossed over to the pop charts reaching #4 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Due to its strong dance flavor, the song was played heavily at dance clubs helping the song to land at #13 on Billboard's dance chart. \"Fight the Power\" gave the brothers their first song to peak in the top 20 on three different charts.\n\nThe success of the song also helped its album, \"The Heat Is On\", reach #1 on the pop chart. The song's lyric, \"we gotta fight the powers that be\", would be interpolated years later by rap group Public Enemy on their 1989 song of the same name. The intense style of the record would be repeated by the Isleys during other recordings including \"Livin' in the Life\", \"Climbin' Up The Ladder\" and \"The Pride\", which like \"Fight the Power\" before it, included a unison lead vocal by Ron, Rudy, and Kelly.\n\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, Information based on Original album Liner notes\n"}

{"id": "1990847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990847", "title": "Yiddish literature", "text": "Yiddish literature\n\nYiddish literature encompasses all those belles-lettres written in Yiddish, the language of Ashkenazic Jewry which is related to Middle High German. The history of Yiddish, with its roots in central Europe and locus for centuries in Eastern Europe, is evident in its literature.\n\nIt is generally described as having three historical phases: Old Yiddish literature; Haskalah and Hasidic literature; and modern Yiddish literature. While firm dates for these periods are hard to pin down, Old Yiddish can be said to have existed roughly from 1300 to 1780; Haskalah and Hasidic literature from 1780 to about 1890; and modern Yiddish literature from 1864 to the present.\n\nYiddish literature began with translations of and commentary on religious texts. (See article on the Yiddish language for a full description of these texts.) The most important writer of old Yiddish literature was Elijah Levita (known as Elye Bokher) who translated and adapted the chivalric romance of Bevis of Hampton, via its Italian version, Buovo d’Antona. Levita’s version, called Bovo d'Antona, and later known with the title \"Bovo-bukh\", was circulated in manuscript from 1507, then published in Isny (Germany) in 1541. This work illustrates the influence of European literary forms on emerging Yiddish literature, not only in its subject but in the form of its stanzas and rhyme scheme, an adaptation of Italian ottava rima. Nonetheless, Levita altered many features of the story to reflect Judaic elements, though they rest uneasily with the essentially Christian nature of chivalry. (For a discussion of the tension between Christian and Jewish elements in the Bovo-bukh, see chapter two of Michael Wex’s \"Born to Kvetch\".)\n\nA number of Yiddish epic poems appeared in the 14-15th centuries. The most important works of this genre are the \"Shmuel-Bukh\" and the \"Mlokhim-Bukh\" – chivalric romances about king David and other Biblical heroes. The stanzaic form of these poems resembles that of the \"Nibelungenlied\". Following the example of other European epics, the \"Shmuel-Bukh\" was not simply recited, but sung or chanted to musical accompaniment; its melody was widely known in Jewish communities.\n\nFar from being rhymed adaptations of the Bible, these old Yiddish epic poems fused the Biblical and Midrashic material with European courtly poetry, thus creating an Ashkenazic national epic, comparable to the \"Nibelungenlied\" and The Song of Roland.\n\nAnother influential work of old Yiddish literature is the \"Mayse-bukh\" (“Story Book”). This work collects ethical tales based on Hebrew and rabbinic sources, as well as folk tales and legends. Based on the inclusion of a few non-Jewish stories, scholars have deduced that the compiler lived in the area that is now western Germany during the last third of the 16th century. It was first published in 1602. These instructional stories are still read in highly religious communities, especially among the Hasidim.\n\nA commentary written for women on the weekly parashot by Rabbi Jacob ben Isaac Ashkenazi in 1616, the \"Tseno Ureno\" (צאנה וראינה), remains a ubiquitous book in Yiddish homes to this day.\n\nWomen wrote old Yiddish literature infrequently, but several collections of tkhines (personal prayers which are not part of liturgy) were written by women such as Sara Bas-Tovim and Sarah Rebekah Rachel Leah Horowitz, both in the 18th century. The most extensive text by a woman from this era is the memoir of the 17th-18th century Glikl of Hameln, a family document that was not published until 1896.\n\nThe rise of Hasidic popular mysticism in the 18th century gave rise to a specific kind of literary work. Alongside its scholarly thought were hagiographic stories venerating its leadership. This gave storytelling a new centrality in Rabbinic Judaism as a form of worship, and spread the movement's appeal. These anecdotal or miraculous stories personified new Hasidic doctrines of the saintly intermediary, Divine Omnipresence, and the hidden value of the common folk. As one master related of his visit to Dov Ber of Mezeritch, \"I went to see how the Maggid tied up his shoelaces\". A story of the Baal Shem Tov, Hasidic founder, represents this:\n\nThe saintly prayers of the Baal Shem Tov and his close circle were unable to lift a harsh Heavenly decree they perceived one New Year. After extending the prayers beyond time, the danger remained. An unlettered shepherd boy entered and was deeply envious of those who could read the holy day's prayers. He said to God \"I don't know how to pray, but I can make the noises of the animals of the field.\" With great feeling he cried out, \"Cock-a-doodle-do, God have mercy!\" Immediately, joy overcame the Baal Shem Tov and he hurried to finish the prayers. Afterwards, he explained that the heartfelt words of the shephard boy opened the Gates of Heaven, and the decree was lifted.\n\nAs Hebrew was reserved for Torah study and prayer, the vernacular Yiddish stories of different masters were compiled in Yiddish or Hebrew writing, beginning with \"Shivchei HaBesht\"-\"In Praise of the Baal Shem Tov\" (1815 Yiddish translation from Hebrew compilation of 1814). In the 20th century Martin Buber publicised Hasidism to the secular world through its stories, mediated through his own Neo-Hasidic philosophy. Previous Kabbalistic themes, accepted without emphasis in Hasidism, entered Eastern European Jewish folklore in tales of reincarnation and possession, and were commonly adapted by later secular Yiddish writers. Meanwhile, the mysticism of Hasidism as well as the culture of wider traditional Judaism, were parodied by Haskalah Yiddish literature.\n\nWithin the works of Hasidic philosophy, another storytelling form was used - insightful parables to illustrate its new mystical interpretations. The Baal Shem Tov used short, soulful analogies, alluded teachings and encouraging anecdotes in first reaching out to revive the common folk, while parables of other masters were integrated within their classic works of Hasidic thought. The distinct parables of Nachman of Breslov comprise a complete literary form that stand alone with their own commentary, in Yiddish original and Hebrew translation. In one example of former Hasidic parable, the Baal Shem Tov explained the mystical meaning of blowing the ram's horn on the New Year:\n\nA King sent his son away from the palace to learn new skills. Regretably, the son lost his royal ways, and forgot his home tongue. After years in exile he remembered his true calling, and desired to return to the palace. Upon approaching the gates, the guards no longer recognised the King's son and refused him entry. At that moment the King appeared on the balcony and saw the commotion of the son at the gates, but also did not recognise his son who now appeared in peasant clothing. In distress, as the son could no longer remember the royal language, he cried out a heartfelt wordless call from his soul. Immediately, the King recognised his voice and delighted in being reunited with his son.\n\nRabbi Nachman’s 13 \"Sippurei Ma'asiyot\" Wonder-Tales of 1816 take mystical parable to a self-contained literary purpose and art. Where the analogies of other masters have direct messages, Rabbi Nachman's imaginative, intricate tales, that can involve stories within stories, offer layered mystical and devotional commentaries, or literary readings. Rabbi Nachman alluded to some meanings when he orally told each tale in Yiddish. He saw their roots in ancient Aggadic mystical articulation, by saying that this concealed form was how Kabbalah was taught orally before Shimon bar Yochai explained it, though the Tales are unique in Rabbinic literature. He took to storytelling as redemptive activity once other paths had been blocked, such as the death of his son in whom he saw Messianic potential; \"the time has come to tell stories\", he said. Rabbi Nachman saw his role as innovative, and his teachings focus on the redemptive scheme of rectification:\n\n\"In the tales told by the Nations of the World are hidden sparks of holiness, but the tales are confused and spiritually out of order, so that the sparks remain hidden.\"\n\nThe thirteenth tale, \"The Seven Beggars\", is the most intricate. The story told on the seventh day is missing and Rabbi Nachman said that it would only be known when the Messiah comes. The Tales, documented in Yiddish with Hebrew translation by Nathan of Breslov, amongst other Hasidic storytelling have had the strongest effect on the development of Yiddish literature.\n\nDuring the same years as the emergence of Hasidism, the most influential secular movement of Jews also appeared in the form of the Haskalah. This movement was influenced by the Enlightenment and opposed superstition in religious life and the antiquated education given to most Jews. They proposed better integration into European culture and society, and were strong opponents of Hasidism. Writers who used their craft to expound this view were Israel Aksenfeld, Solomon (or Shloyme) Ettinger and Isaac Mayer Dick. Aksenfeld was at first a follower of Reb Nachman of Bratslav, but later abandoned Hasidism and became a strong opponent of it. His novel \"Dos shterntikhl\" (“The head-scarf”), published in 1861, portrays the Hasidic world as intolerant and small-minded. Only five of his works were published because of opposition from Hasidic leaders. His work is realist and shows the influence of 19th century Russian literature. Ettinger was a physician who wrote plays, including what is considered the most important of the Haskalah era, “Serkele.” His satiric style shows the influence of European drama: one scholar speculates that he read Molière. I.M. Dick (1808–1893) wrote short stories which sold tens of thousands of copies in book form. His role in literary development is as significant for creating a readership for Yiddish as for the content of his work, which tends to the didactic. He also wrote in Hebrew, including the outstanding Talmudic parody, “Masseket Aniyyut” (“Tractate Poverty”).\n\nModern Yiddish literature is generally dated to the publication in 1864 of Sholem Yankev Abramovitsh’s novel \"Dos kleyne mentshele\" (\"The Little Person\"). Abramovitsh had previously written in Hebrew, the language in which many proponents of the Haskalah communicated with each other, until this publication. With this novel, originally published serially in a Yiddish newspaper, Abramovitsh introduced his alter ego, the character of Mendele Moykher Sforim (\"Mendel the Book Peddler\"), the character who narrates this and many succeeding stories. Abramovitsh himself is often known by this name, and it appears as the \"author\" on several of his books, producing a complex set of relations between the author, the persona and the readership which has been explored most thoroughly by Dan Miron. Abramovitsh’s work is ironic and sharp, while maintaining the voice of a folksy narrator. His work critiques corruption inside the Jewish community and that imposed on it from Russian and Polish governing institutions. He also continues the tradition of Haskalah literature with his attack on superstition and outmoded traditions such as arranged marriage. His extraordinary parody of the picaresque, \"Kitser masoes Binyomen hashlishi\" (\"The Brief Travels of Benjamin the Third\"), published in 1878, was his last great work and provides one of his strongest critiques of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement.\n\nAbramovitsh’s influence lay in two factors. First, he wrote in Yiddish at a time when most Jewish thinkers tended to Hebrew or a non-Jewish language such as German. Secondly, as Dan Miron demonstrates, Abramovitsh brought Yiddish belles lettres firmly into the modern era through the use of rhetorical strategies that allowed his social reform agenda to be expressed at the highest level of literary and artistic achievement. The outpouring of Yiddish literature in modernist forms that followed Abramovitsh demonstrates how important this development was in giving voice to Jewish aspirations, both social and literary. The most important of the early writers to follow Abramovitsh were Sholem Rabinovitsh, popularly known by his alter-ego, Sholem Aleichem, and I. L. Peretz. Rabinovitsh’s best-known works are the stories centering on the character Tevye the Dairyman. Written over many years and in response to the variety of Jewish catastrophes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the stories epitomize Rabinovitsh's style, including his signature style of \"laughter through tears\". I. L. Peretz brought into Yiddish a wide array of modernist techniques he encountered in his reading of European fiction. While himself politically radical, particularly during the 1890s, his fiction is enormously nuanced and allows multiple readings. His work is both simple and caustic, more psychological and more individualistic than Abramovitsh or Rabinovitsh’s. For these reasons, he is considered the first true modernist in Yiddish literature. He wrote primarily stories of which \"Bontshe shvayg\" (Bontshe the Silent) is one of his best known. As with much of his work, it manages to convey two apparently opposing messages: sympathy for the oppressed with critique of passivity as a response to oppression.\n\nTogether, Abramovitsh, Rabinovitsh and I. L. Peretz are usually referred to as the three \"classic\" Yiddish writers (\"di klasiker\" in Yiddish). They are also nickednamed respectively the \"grandfather\", the \"father\" and the \"son\" of Yiddish literature. This formulation erases the fact that they were all roughly contemporaneous and are best understood as a single phenomenon rather than as distinct generational manifestations of a tradition. Nonetheless, this formulation was propounded by the classic writers themselves, perhaps as a means of investing their fledgling literary culture with a lineage that could stand up to other world literatures they admired.\n\nDramatic works in Yiddish grew up at first separately, and later intertwined with other Yiddish movements. Early drama, following Ettinger’s example, was written by Abraham Goldfaden, and Jacob Gordin. Much of what was presented on the Yiddish stage were translations from European repertoire, and as a result much of the earliest original writing in Yiddish owes as much to German theatre as to the classic Yiddish writers.\n\nWhile the three classic writers were still at their height, the first true movement in modern Yiddish literature sprang up in New York. The “Sweatshop Poets,” as this school has come to be called, were all immigrant workers who experienced first hand the inhumane working conditions in the factories of their day. The leading members of this group were Morris Rosenfeld, Morris Winchevsky, David Edelstadt and Joseph Bovshover. Their work centers on the subject of proletarian oppression and struggle, and uses the styles of Victorian verse, producing a rhetoric that is highly stylized. As a result it is little read or understood today. Simultaneously in Warsaw a group of writers centered around I. L. Peretz took Yiddish to another level of modern experimentation; they included David Pinski, S. Ansky, Sholem Asch and I.M. Weissenberg. A later Warsaw group, “Di Khalyastre” (“The Gang”) included notables such as Israel Joshua Singer, Peretz Hirshbein, Melech Ravitch and Uri Zvi Grinberg (who went on to write most of his work in Hebrew). Like their New York counterpart, Di Yunge (“The Young Ones”), they broke with earlier Yiddish writers and attempted to free Yiddish writing, particularly verse, from its preoccupation with politics and the fate of the Jews. Prominent members of Di Yunge included Mani Leib, Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, H. Leivick, Zishe Landau and the prose writers David Ignatoff, Lamed Shapiro and Isaac Raboy. Just a few years after Di Yunge came into prominence, a group called “In Zikh” (“Introspection”) declared itself the true avant garde, rejecting metered verse and declaring that non-Jewish themes were a valid topic for Yiddish poetry. The most important member of this group was Yankev Glatshteyn. Glatshteyn was interested in exotic themes, in poems that emphasized the sound of words, and later, as the Holocaust loomed and then took place, in reappropriations of Jewish tradition. His poem “A gute nakht, velt” (“Good Night, World,” 1938) seems to foresee the tragedy on the horizon in Eastern Europe. In Vilnius, Lithuania (called Vilna or Vilne by its Jewish inhabitants, and one of the most historically significant centers of Yiddish cultural activity), the group “Yung Vilne” (“Young Vilna”) included Chaim Grade, Abraham Sutzkever and Szmerke Kaczerginski. Grade’s short story “Mayn krig mit Hersh Raseyner” (“My Quarrel With Hershl Rasseyner”) is one of the classic post-Holocaust Yiddish stories, encapsulating the philosophical dilemma faced by many survivors. Sutzkever went on to be one of major poets of the 20th century.\nDuring the radical turn of the 1930s, a group of writers clustered around the U. S. Communist Party came to be known as “Di Linke” (“The Left Wing”). This group included Moishe Nadir, Malka Lee and Ber Grin. In Canada, a similar group was known as the Proletariat school of writers, exemplified by Yudica. In the Soviet Union, Yiddish literature underwent a dramatic flowering, with such greats as David Bergelson, Der Nister, Peretz Markish and Moyshe Kulbak. Several of these writers were murdered during a Stalinist purge known as the Night of the Murdered Poets (August 12–13, 1952), including Itzik Fefer and Leib Kvitko. Bergelson is considered by many an underrated genius whose work in the modernist novel may be among the most interesting examples of the form. Important Soviet writers who escaped persecution include Moyshe Altman, Ikhil Shraybman, Note Lurie, Eli Schechtman, Shike Driz, Rivke Rubin, Shira Gorshman, and others. There appears to have been no rhyme or reason to explain why certain writers were not persecuted, as all these writers pursued similar themes in their writing and participated in similar groupings of Jewish intellectuals.\n\nAn interesting feature of Yiddish literature in its most active years (1900–1940) is the presence of numerous women writers who were less involved in specific movements or tied to a particular artistic ideology. Writers such as Celia Dropkin, Anna Margolin, Kadia Molodowsky, Esther Kreitman and Esther Shumiatcher Hirschbein created bodies of work that do not fit easily into a particular category and which are often experimental in form or subject matter. Margolin’s work pioneered the use of assonance and consonance in Yiddish verse. She preferred off-rhymes to true rhymes. Dropkin introduced a highly charged erotic vocabulary and shows the influence of 19th century Russian poetry. Kreitman, the sister of I. J. and I. B. Singer, wrote novels and short stories, many of which were sharply critical of gender inequality in traditional Jewish life.\n\nIn the developing Yiddish literary scene in the United States in the first decades of the twentieth century, women writers were regarded by literary critics as a rare phenomenon, at the same time that editors of newspapers and journals, especially those of the socialist and anarchist press, were eager to publish women's work, as a hallmark of modernity and in the hope of boosting circulation; however, a few leading male writers and editors, including Avrom Reyzen and Aaron Glanz-Leyeles, expressed the view that women writers had a particular contribution to make to the emerging American Yiddish literature. Women writers such as Yente Serdatzky and Fradl Shtok, found a limited degree of recognition for their work but ultimately were out of step with their male literary peers and came to an impasse in their writing careers. Shtok, at first known for her poetry, especially for being among the first Yiddish poets to write sonnets, garnered disappointing reviews for her collection of short stories (\"Gezammelte ertseylungen\", 1919) that were innovative in the way they incorporated the subjectivity, including erotic desires, of female characters.\n\nCertain male writers also did not associate with a particular literary group, or did so for a short time before moving on to other creative ethics. Among these were Itzik Manger, whose clever re-imaginings of Biblical and other Jewish stories are accessible and playful but deeply intellectual. Other writers in this category are Joseph Opatoshu, I. B. Singer (who is always called “Bashevis” in Yiddish to distinguish him from his older brother), I. J. Singer and Aaron Zeitlin.\n\nMany of the writers mentioned above who wrote during and after the 1940s responded to the Holocaust in their literary works—some wrote poetry and stories while in ghettos, concentration camps, and partisan groups, and many continued to address the Holocaust and its aftereffects in their subsequent writing. Yiddish writers known best for their writings about the Holocaust include Yitzhak Katzenelson, Y. Shpigl, and Katsetnik.\n\nThe awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Isaac Bashevis Singer in 1978 helped cement his reputation as one of the great writers of world literature. Many readers of Yiddish, however, are convinced that there are many finer writers among Yiddish literature, including his brother. Chaim Grade believed himself overlooked by the English-speaking world. Cynthia Ozick’s short story “Envy; or, Yiddish in America” implies a similar emotion on the part of a Yiddish poet, generally taken to be based on Yankev Glatshteyn. Some Yiddish critics complained of the excessive sex and superstition in Singer’s work, which they felt brought Yiddish literature in general into disrepute. In addition, Singer’s habit of presenting himself to the American press as the last or only Yiddish writer was irksome to the dozens of writers still living and working at the time. But in spite of these squabbles (which to some extent continue, years after the death of the protagonists), most scholars of Yiddish today would agree that the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Singer brought an unprecedented amount of attention to Yiddish literature, and has served to heighten interest in the field generally. Many scholars believe it to be a justified prize on the basis of the part of Singer’s oeuvre that is available in translation, which represents his most accomplished works.\n\nThe last prewar European-born writers who published or are still publishing in the early 21st century include the Canadian authors Chava Rosenfarb, Simcha Simchovitch (1921-2017) and Grunia Slutzky-Kohn (born 1928); Israeli writers including Tzvi Ayznman (1920-2015), Aleksander Shpiglblat (1927-2013), Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim, Yitzkhok Luden, Mishe Lev (1917-2013), Yente Mash (1922-2013), Tzvi Kanar (1929–2009), Elisheva Kohen-Tsedek (born 1922) and Lev Berinsky (born 1939); and American poet-songwriter Beyle Schaechter-Gottesman, and poets and prose masters Yonia Fain (1913–2013) and Moyshe Szklar (editor of the Los Angeles Yiddish literary periodical Khezhbn; 1920-2014), as well as the prolific feuilletonist and playwright Miriam Hoffman. Writers of the \"younger\" postwar born generation comprising those born in the late 1940s through 1960s (many hailing from the former Soviet Union) include Alexander Belousov (1948–2004), Mikhoel Felsenbaum, Daniel Galay, Moyshe Lemster, Boris Sandler (who edited the Yiddish \"Forverts\" edition of The Jewish Daily Forward from 1998 to 2016), Velvl Chernin, Zisye Veytsman, Heershadovid Menkes (pen name of Dovid Katz), and Boris Karloff (pen name of Dov-Ber Kerler, editor of \"Yerusholaymer Almanakh\"). A younger generation of writers who began to come to the fore in the 21st century includes poets Gitl Schaechter-Viswanath, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub and Yoel Matveyev in the US, Yisroel Nekrasov in Saint Petersburg, Haike Beruriah Wiegand in London, Thomas Soxberger in Vienna, and the prose writers Boris Kotlerman in Israel and Gilles Rozier (editor of \"Gilgulim\") in Paris. The earlier works of some of the younger generation authors were collected in the anthology \"Vidervuks\" (regrowth), published in 1989. Recent works of many of contemporary authors appeared in 2008 in Paris () and Jerusalem (Yerusholaymer Almanakh).\n\nA new generation of Yiddish writers has emerged from the Hasidic and Haredi movements of contemporary Orthodoxy. The author known only by the pseudonym Katle Kanye writes blistering satire of current halakhic literature as well as poetry and thoughtful commentary on Hasidic life. Another example of a Haredi Yiddish blog-writer is Natirlich. Spy thrillers in Yiddish have become a popular genre within Hasidic communities.\n\nEuropean literatures have had a strong influence on Yiddish literature, but until the late 20th century there was little return flow into English, except through bilingual writers who chose to write in English, such as Anzia Yezierska and Ab Cahan. The poet Irena Klepfisz, who was born to Polish-speaking Jewish parents in Nazi-occupied Poland and learned Yiddish in school after immigrating to the United States, is influenced by the language in her work and also translates poetry from the Yiddish.\n\nCurrently, many young writers with little knowledge of Yiddish have been influenced by Yiddish literature in translation, such as Nathan Englander and Jonathan Safran Foer. An exception is Dara Horn, who has studied both Yiddish and Hebrew and draws on both of these traditions in her English-language novels.\n\nThe last Yiddish language writers in the former Soviet Union were Aleksandr Bejderman in Odessa and Yoysef Burg in Chernivtsi; both have passed.\n\nLiterary works written originally in other languages continue to be translated and published in Yiddish. UNESCO's \"Index Translationum\" database lists 98 foreign-language books published in Yiddish translation since circa 1979, in a number of countries including Israel, the USA, Romania, Germany, and the USSR.\n\n\n"}

The song attacked conformity and advocated control, and it was much like some of the group's \"Do What You Wanna Do\" records of the time.\n\nThis song's free-love message helped it become an R&B smash upon its release. It peaked at number four on the R&B singles chart and reached number fifty-two on the pop chart. Ronald's gritty vocals are helped by his brothers' rambunctious and testosterone-driven background vocals. The song also features a screaming guitar solo from Ernie, and Chris closes it with a clavinet solo.\n\nPart one is the vocal version, featuring lead singer Ronald and his accompanying backup singing brothers Rudolph and O'Kelly. Part two is the instrumental version.\n\nThis song was included on the album \"Live It Up\", which was a popular recording upon its release in 1974.

Among his teachers was poet Leonardo De Martino (1830-1923), whose influence is omnipresent in Shiroka's verse. His earliest verse publication, \"All'Albania, all'armi, all'armi!\" (\"To Albania, to arms, to arms!\"), was a nationalist poem on the defense of Ulcinj, which was written in Italian and printed in the Osservatore Cattolico (\"Catholic Observer\") of Milan in 1878. Like many Albanian intellectuals of the late 19th century, Shiroka spent much of his life in exile. In 1880, after the defeat of the League of Prizren, he emigrated to the Middle East, and settled in Egypt and Lebanon where he worked as an engineer in railway construction. Shiroka became a member of a society named Vëllazëria Shqiptare (Albanian brotherhood) that was founded in Cairo during 1894 by Albanian expatriates.\n\nShiroka's nationalist, satirical and meditative verse in Albanian was written mostly from 1896 to 1903. It appeared in journals such as Faik Konitza's \"Albania\", the Albanian periodicals published in Egypt, and the Shkodër religious monthly \"Elçija i Zemers t'Jezu Krisctit\" (\"The Messenger of the Sacred Heart\"). Shiroka, who also used the pseudonyms Gegë Postripa and Ulqinaku, is the author of at least sixty poems, three short stories, articles and several translations, in particular of religious works for Catholic liturgy. His verse collection, \"Zâni i zêmrës\", Tirana, 1933, (\"The voice of the heart\"), which was composed at the turn of the century, was published by Ndoc Nikaj two years before Shiroka's death in Beirut.\n\nShiroka's verse, inspired by early-19th-century French and Italian romantic poets such as Alfred de Musset (1810-1857), Alfonse de Lamartine (1790-1869), and Tommaso Grossi (1790-1853), whom he had read as a young man in Shkodër, does not cover any unusual thematic or lexical range, nor is it all of literary quality, though the latter assertion is no doubt valid for most Rilindja poets. Shiroka is remembered as a deeply emotional lyricist, and as one of linguistic purity, who was obsessed with his own fate and that of his distant homeland. Recurrent in his work, there is the theme of nostalgia for the country of his birth.\n\nBe off, swallow\nFarewell, for spring has come,\nBe off, swallow, on your flight,\nFrom Egypt to other lands,\nSearching over hill and plain\nBe off to Albania on your flight,\nOff to Shkodër, my native town!\n\nConvey my greetings\nTo the old house where I was born,\nAnd greet the lands around it\nWhere I spent my early years;\nBe off thither on your flight,\nAnd greet my native town!\n\nAnd when you come to Fush' e Rmajit,\nSwallow, stop there and take your rest;\nIn that land of sorrow are the graves\nOf the mother and father who raised me;\nWeep in your exquisite voice\nAnd lament them with your song!\n\nFor ages I have not been to Albania\nTo attend those graves;\nYou, swallow, robed in black,\nWeep there on my behalf,\nWith that exquisite voice of yours\nLament them with your song!\n"}

After Lauderdale's retirement in 1680 he was one of the Committee of Seven which managed Scottish affairs. He was appointed Lord Justice General in 1682 and an Extraordinary Lord of Session on 16 November the same year. He introduced the use of the thumbscrew in Scotland. He was also Lord Chancellor of Scotland, 1684–1688.\n\nHe was a partner with William Penn in the settlement of East New Jersey in 1681. As one of 24 proprietors of a large parcel of property that took up much of what is now the State of New Jersey, Perth sponsored an expedition in 1684 to establish a settlement there. The City of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which sits on the waterfront facing Staten Island, New York, and which was once a port city in its own right, is named in his honor — a statue of Lord Perth stands in front of City Hall (\"Amboy\" comes from a Lenape word meaning \"the point\").\n\nIn 1685 the 4th Earl of Perth converted to Roman Catholicism, along with his brother, the 1st Earl of Melfort, which brought him into high favour with King James II. In 1686, Perth and his brother opened a Catholic chapel in Edinburgh, and their public attendance there resulted in a riot. Perth and his brother suggested to James II that the Scottish Parliament would approve a repeal of the Test Act and penal laws against Catholics and Protestant dissenters, but this was later proved untrue. On 29 May 1687, nonetheless, he was made a Knight of the Thistle, being one of the eight original knights of that Order.\n\nHe is said to have had a novodamus, 17 December 1687, (on resignation) of his dignities, creating him Earl of Perth, Lord Drummond, Stobhall, and Montefex (Scotland), with remainder, failing heirs-male of his and of his brother's body, to the heirs-male of the second Earl.\n\nWhen James retreated from Salisbury before William, the people, in the absence of the troops, whom Perth had disbanded, rose in Edinburgh. Perth departed on 8 December under a strong escort to his seat of Drummond Castle, Perthshire. Finding himself unsafe there, he fled in disguise over the Ochil mountains to Burntisland, where he gained a vessel about to sail to France. He had, however, been recognised, and a boatful of watermen from Kirkcaldy pursued the vessel, which, as it was almost a dead calm, was overtaken at the mouth of the Forth. Perth was dragged from the hold in woman's clothes, stripped of all he had, and thrown into the common prison of Kirkcaldy. Thence he was taken to Stirling Castle, and not released until 4 August 1693 on condition of a bond to leave the kingdom under penalty of £5000.\n\nHe joined the exiled King at St Germain, by whom he was, on 19 August 1696, appointed Governor to the young Prince of Wales, and by whose testamentary directions he was, before 17 October 1701, created by King James III and VIII, Duke of Perth, Marquess of Drummond, Earl of Stobhall, Viscount Cargill, and Baron Concraig, all proclaimed as in the Peerage of Scotland (but in reality in the Jacobite peerage), with remainder to his heirs-male whatsoever. In 1701 he was recognised as a Duke in France by King Louis XIV.\n\nOn 14 February 1703, he was made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and on 21 June 1706 he was appointed a Knight of the Garter. He was afterwards Chamberlain to Queen Mary of Modena, and is said to have been created a Knight of the Golden Fleece by the King of Spain.\n\nDuring James's exile, the Duke of Perth acted as his ambassador to Rome, and after the King's death, Perth erected a monument to him in Paris.\n\nThe Duke of Perth married:\n\nHe died at St Germain, was interred in the Scots Chapel, Paris, and was succeeded by his son and heir by his first wife:\n\n"}

It was the longest total solar eclipse during the 21st century, the longest total solar eclipse during the 3rd millennium will be on 16 July 2186. It lasted a maximum of 6 minutes and 38.86 seconds off the coast of Southeast Asia, causing tourist interest in eastern China, Pakistan, Japan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Its greatest magnitude was 1.07991, occurring only 6 hours, 18 minutes after perigee, with greatest eclipse totality lasting 6 minutes, 38.86 seconds during the Total Solar Eclipse of July 22, 2009.\n\nThis is the second eclipse this season.\n\nFirst eclipse this season: 7 July 2009 Penumbral Lunar Eclipse\n\nThird eclipse this season: 6 August 2009 Penumbral Lunar Eclipse\n\nIt was the 37th eclipse of the 136th Saros cycle, which began with a partial eclipse on June 14, 1360 and will conclude with a partial eclipse on July 30, 2622.\n\nA partial eclipse was seen within the broad path of the Moon's penumbra, including most of Southeast Asia (all of Pakistan, India and China) and north-eastern Oceania.\n\nThe total eclipse was visible from a narrow corridor through northern India, eastern Nepal, northern Bangladesh, Bhutan, the northern tip of Myanmar, central China and the Pacific Ocean, including the northern part of the Ryukyu Islands, the whole Volcano Islands except South Iwo Jima, Marshall Islands, and Kiribati.\n\nTotality was visible in many large cities, including Dhaka and Dinajpur, and Chapai Nawabganj district in Bangladesh; Surat, Vadodara, Bhopal, Varanasi, Patna, Gaya, Siliguri, Tawang and Guwahati in India; and Chengdu, Nanchong, Chongqing, Yichang, Jingzhou, Wuhan, Huanggang, Hefei, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Huzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Shanghai as well as over the Three Gorges Dam in China. However, in Shanghai, the largest city in the eclipse's path, the view was obscured by heavy clouds. According to NASA, the Japanese island Kitaio Jima was predicted to have the best viewing conditions featuring both longer viewing time (being the closest point of land to the point of greatest eclipse) and lower cloud cover statistics than all of continental Asia.\n\nThe eclipse, and the reaction of thousands of observers at Varanasi was captured by the Science Channel Wonders of the Universe series hosted by Brian Cox.\n\nThis eclipse may be the most-viewed total solar eclipse in history, with 30 million people in Shanghai and Hangzhou alone.\n\nThousands of pilgrims gathered on the banks of the Ganges River in Varanasi, India to experience the eclipse as a religious or spiritual event. Some people expected that there would be a relationship, either positive or negative, between their health and the occurrence of the eclipse.\n\nIndian scientists observed the solar eclipse from an Indian Air Force plane.\n\nThe Chinese government used the opportunity to provide scientific education and to dispel any superstition. A flight by China Eastern Airlines from Wuhan to Shanghai took a slight detour and followed the course of the eclipse to allow longer observation time for the scientists on board.\n\nObservers in Japan were excited by the prospect of experiencing the first eclipse in 46 years, but found the experience dampened by cloudy skies obscuring the view.\n\nIn Bangladesh, where the eclipse lasted approximately 3 minutes and 44 seconds, thousands of people were able to witness the eclipse despite rain and overcast skies.\n\nThis solar eclipse was the longest total solar eclipse to occur in the 21st century, and will not be surpassed in duration until 13 June 2132. Totality lasted for up to 6 minutes and 38.86 seconds, with the maximum eclipse occurring in the ocean at 02:35:21 UTC about 100 km south of the Bonin Islands, southeast of Japan. The uninhabited North Iwo Jima island was the landmass with totality time closest to maximum, while the closest inhabited point was Akusekijima, where the eclipse lasted 6 minutes and 26 seconds.\n\nThe cruise ship \"Costa Classica\" was chartered specifically to view this eclipse and by viewing the eclipse at the point of maximum duration and cruising along the centerline during the event, duration was extended to 6 minutes, 42 seconds.\n\nThe eclipse was part of Saros series 136, as was the solar eclipse of July 11, 1991, which was slightly longer, lasting up to 6 minutes 53.08 seconds (previous eclipses of the same saros series on June 30, 1973 and June 20, 1955, were longer, lasting 7 min 03.55 and 7 min 07.74, respectively). The next event from this series will be on August 2, 2027. The exceptional duration was a result of the Moon being near perigee, with the apparent diameter of the Moon 7.991% larger than the Sun (magnitude 1.07991) and the Earth being near aphelion where the Sun appeared slightly smaller.\n\nIn contrast the annular solar eclipse of January 26, 2009 occurred near lunar apogee and 7.175% smaller apparent diameter to the sun. And the next solar eclipse of January 15, 2010 was also annular, with the Moon 8.097% smaller than the Sun.\n\nThe Terrain Mapping Camera in the Chandrayaan-1 lunar mission was used to image the earth during the eclipse.\n\nIt was also observed by the Japanese geostationary satellite MTSAT:\n\n\nThis total eclipse the second in the series of three eclipses in a one-month period, with two minor penumbral lunar eclipses, first on July 7 and last on August 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-eclipse news:\n\nPhotos:\n"}

As with Vidal's other books in his \"Narratives of Empire\" series, this novel offers an insight into the journalism of the time, following the exploits of William Randolph Hearst in his efforts to displace Theodore Roosevelt as president in 1904. Following the events leading up to and following the ascension of Theodore Roosevelt to the presidency following William McKinley's assassination, it includes pithy portraits of such leading public figures of the day as Roosevelt, Hearst, Henry Brooks Adams, Henry James, Secretary of State John Hay and President William McKinley.

{"id": "1990962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990962", "title": "William Bullock (inventor)", "text": "William Bullock (inventor)\n\nWilliam Bullock (1813 – April 12, 1867) was an American inventor whose 1863 improvements to Richard March Hoe's rotary printing press helped revolutionize the printing industry due to its great speed and efficiency. A few years after his invention, Bullock was accidentally killed by his own web rotary press.\n\nWilliam Bullock was born in Greenville, New York in 1813\n. Orphaned at an early age, he was raised by his brother. In his youth, he worked with his brother as a machinist and iron-founder. His fascination with books led him to acquire much knowledge of mechanics. At age 21, he was running his own machinery shop in Savannah, Georgia. At this time, Bullock invented a shingle-cutting machine, but his business went broke when he was unable to market it.\n\nWhile in Georgia Bullock married Angeline Kimball and had seven children with her. When his wife died in 1850, he married Angeline's sister Emily, who bore him six children.\n\nBullock returned to New York and designed such devices as a cotton and hay press, a seed planter, and a lathe cutting machine. He also invented a grain drill, which won him a prize from the Franklin Institute in 1849. Shortly after this, he became involved in the newspaper world, and began working as an editor for a Philadelphia newspaper, \"The Banner of the Union\".\n\nThe paper later moved to Catskill, New York. In 1853, Bullock began working on a hand-turned wooden printing press that had a self-feeder, an idea that laid the foundation for his later presses, one of which he designed in 1860 for the national publication \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly\".\n\nBullock moved to Pittsburgh, and in a couple of years, perfected a printing press called the web rotary press. Richard March Hoe had invented the rotary press in 1843, but Bullock's press was an improvement over Hoe's design. Bullock's press allowed for continuous large rolls of paper to be automatically fed through the rollers, eliminating the laborious hand-feeding system of earlier presses. The press was self-adjusting, printed on both sides, folded the paper, and a sharp serrated knife that rarely needed sharpening cut sheets with rapid precision. The press could print up to 12,000 sheets an hour; later improvements raised the speed to up to 30,000 sheets an hour.\n\nIn a bizarre accident, Bullock was killed by his own invention. On April 3, 1867 he was making adjustments to one of his new presses that was being installed for the \"Philadelphia Public Ledger\" newspaper. Bullock tried to kick a driving belt onto a pulley. His leg was crushed when it became caught in the machine. After a few days, he developed gangrene. On April 12, 1867, Bullock died during an operation to amputate the leg. He is buried in Union Dale Cemetery on Pittsburgh's North Side.\n\n38,200 April 14, 1863 Printing press to use a continuous web or roll of paper, the first machine built especially for curved stereotype plates.

{"id": "1990966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990966", "title": "Business education", "text": "Business education\n\nBusiness education is a branch of education that involves teaching the skills and operations of the business industry. This field of education occurs at multiple levels, including secondary and higher education institutes. Education in business has many forms, mainly occurring within a classroom of a school. Internships are also another way to receive this type of education. A business education has many components, as there are many different areas of the business industry as a whole. An education in business varies greatly in its curriculum and popularity around the world. Career development is often an integral part of an education in business.\n\nBusiness is taught as an academic subject at secondary level in many countries, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Lesotho, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Sweden, Tanzania, Malaysia and the United Kingdom. At pre-tertiary level, it is often called Business Studies, and usually combines elements of accountancy, finance, marketing, organizational studies, human resource management and economics.\n\nAt the university level, students have the opportunity to take undergraduate degrees, usually a bachelor's degree, in business and management. Specific curricula and degree-granting procedures differ by program and by region. In general though, the program will comprise either preparation for management and general business, or a detailed - more academic - focus on a specific area. Regardless, all will typically include basic selections such as Accounting, Marketing, Finance, Operations Management, and Economics for business.\n\nManagement-directed programs are designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional areas of a company, and their interconnection, and also to develop the student's practical managerial skills, communication skills and business decision-making capability. These programs thus incorporate training and practical experience, in the form of case projects, presentations, internships, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from the industry.\n\nSubject specific programs, on the other hand, focus on a particular area, and are often more weighted towards theory. Even in these cases, however, additional to their major, students are exposed to general business principles, taking initial courses in accounting/finance, human resources, statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems.\n\nDegrees offered here include:\n\nAt the graduate school level, students seek a variety of master's degrees, either in general management–very commonly the MBA–or in a specific area, such as marketing or finance. A further distinction is that students pursuing postgraduate degrees often have some business experience, although this is not always a program requirement.\n\nCorresponding to both of these, graduate degrees in business and management are generally of two types: \n\nA related distinction: the M.Sc in Management is more specialized than an MBA, and is more suited for academic research, while the MBA is more industry- and management-focused.\n\nAs regards degree structure, postgraduate business programs are, in general, designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike; the mix, though, will differ by degree and by school, as discussed. Learning is then through lectures, case studies, and often team projects (“syndicate” work). The theory is covered in the classroom setting by academic faculty. Particularly in the MBA, the theory is then reinforced, and revisited, also in the classroom setting, through the case method, placing the student in the role of the decision maker, \"complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real business issues.\" Practical learning often comprises consulting projects with real clients, or at least addressing an actual case, and is often undertaken in teams. The practical elements (as well as the case studies) may involve external practitioners, and sometimes executives, supporting the teaching from academic faculty. (See Business school#Use of case studies and #Other approaches.) One of the challenges for business academics is demonstrating that their curriculum is relevant to those who want to become managers.\n\nDegrees offered include:\n\nAt the doctoral level, all degrees offered are research focused, although they do differ as regards their relative weightings of theory versus practice. Typically, the DBA, DPA, DHA and D.Mgt emphasize managerial practice alongside research; relatedly, the theses for these degrees will often focus on applied research. The other doctorates here are (exclusively) theory and research based. Entrance is usually on the basis of a relevant master's degree, and for practice-weighted degrees, relevant managerial experience. For the topic areas applicable to the thesis component see: List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States\n\nA business education can either be a broad-based curriculum or one can choose to have a concentration, in which they focus their learning on one particular part of the industry. Examples of these concentrations and some topics they typically cover are:\n\n\nAn internship is when a person works for a company for a temporary amount of time, typically for a few weeks over the summer or winter. By participating in the program, a student will be able to act in the everyday operation of the industry. They give the participants real-world experience in their desired career. Internships also give the company it is at an idea of whether or not the participant would be a good fit as a full-time employee. Many people complete internships while they are in school, whether that be secondary or post-secondary education. These are very common, and have started to be a requirement, in finding a job in the business world.  Although internships are by no means a new form of educating a student, the amount that have completed a program has only continued to grow. In 2008 about one out of every two graduating college students had included a completed internship in their job applications.\n\nThere is significant evidence that has indicated that completing and internship develops skills essential to success in the business world as well as everyday life. The skills that are mainly developed while participating in an internship program includes interpersonal and social skills, as well as quantitative or other technical skills. Many internships use group projects as well in order to develop teamwork and leadership skills. All of these skills are vital to a business and are difficult to be taught in a class room. These skills are very valuable to a company and the ability to train these skills is making internships extremely valuable in business.\n\nMany programs within a business education have a main focus on the career development of their students or audience. They want to prepare them for entering the labor market and ensure they possess the best knowledge and skills of the industry possible. The aid in these programs can range from the guidance in career choices to solidifying a student's first full-time job. The idea of curriculum is typically integrated straight in to the curriculum of one's business education. This allows the students to focus on both at the same time while also understanding the importance of thinking of their life after school has on their life. Additionally, it allows students to think more about their goals and interests to determine if their current path of academics is what they wish to continue. Many faculty members will typically reach out to students and attempt to connect to graduates. This connects the current students with alumni in their field, allowing them to hear from people in their career path who were in their place not too long ago. This information lets students understand what is necessary to do in order to succeed in their desired career. There are instances however, where the effort of career development while still obtaining a degree does not yield a desire result. Research of business undergraduates state that only about 60% obtain a full-time job by graduation and of that percentage, only 40% have one that is consistent with their major.\n\n"}

He was a leader of the Rodina (Motherland) party, until it merged with other similar Russian parties to form the Fair Russia party. He holds two doctorate degrees in philosophy and in technology.\n\nOn 18 February 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev appointed Rogozin as the Special Representative on anti-missile defense; he negotiates with NATO countries on this issue.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, Rogozin was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister, in charge of the defense and space industries. For the defense industry, he led the creation of the Russian Foundation for Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Industry. In May 2018, he became the head of the Russian state space corporation Roscosmos.\n\nIn 2015, Rogozin was the head of Russia's Arctic Commission.\n\nRogozin is an active user of Twitter and Facebook.\n\nRogozin was born in Moscow to a family of a Soviet military scientist. He graduated from Moscow State University in 1986, with a degree in journalism, and in 1988, he graduated the University of Marxism–Leninism under the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU with another degree in economics.\n\nIn 1993, Rogozin joined the recently created party Congress of Russian Communities led by General Alexander Lebed and, after its founder died in a 2002 helicopter crash, Rogozin became joint leader with Sergey Glazyev of what became the Rodina party, which was described by \"Novaya Gazeta\" liberal journalist Anna Politkovskaya as 'created by the Kremlin's spin doctors specifically ... to draw moderately nationalist voters away from the more extreme National Bolsheviks'. Rogozin was elected to the State Duma as a deputy from Voronezh Oblast in 1997, and he became a vocal activist for protection of rights of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet republics.\n\nRogozin was re-elected to the State Duma in 1999 and then appointed the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, drawing a lot of media attention and a share of criticism for some of his flamboyant public remarks. In 2002, he was appointed a Special Representative of the Russian President to deal with Kaliningrad problems that arose by the Baltic states joining the European Union. Rogozin received an official letter of gratitude from Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn 2003, Rogozin became one of the leaders of the Rodina (Motherland) \"national-patriotic\" coalition, which won 9.2% of the popular vote or 37 of the 450 seats in the Duma in 2003 parliamentary election, briefly propelling him to the post of the Duma's vice-speaker, from which he was dismissed a year and a half later as a result of some elaborate interfaction dealings. He remained an ordinary member of the Duma until the following election, in 2007.\n\nAfter the breakthrough in 2003 elections, Rogozin became involved in power struggle with Rodina's other co-chairman Glazyev, who had socialist views. Glazyev nominated himself as the party's candidate in the 2004 presidential election, but Rogozin called on his party comrades to support incumbent Putin. Rogozin soon ousted Glazyev, to become the party's sole leader.\nUnder Rogozin, Rodina shifted towards the right wing of Russian politics and became the second largest and one of the country's most successful parties. A number of controversies on Rogozin's policies culminated in it being banned in 2005 from standing for election to the Moscow City Duma for using what was considered as chauvinist slogan 'Let's Clean the Garbage!'. Many analysts believe it was made illegally to prevent Rogozin becoming a candidate at the Russian presidential elections in 2008.\n\nRogozin's right views were not shared by all his party's members. In early 2006, at Rodina's congress, Rogozin resigned as party leader. Rogozin left Rodina after its merger with the Russian Party of Life and the Pensioners' Party into Fair Russia. In November 2006, he was the Chairman of the revived Congress of Russian Communities. In April 2007, he announced that he may support the formation of the Great Russia Party, in conjunction with the Movement Against Illegal Immigration. The party said that it may consider supporting the candidacy of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko for the Presidency of Russia in 2008, a move that was unconstitutional because Lukashenko is not a Russian citizen. Because Russian authorities had not registered Great Russia, the party could not contest the legislative election in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, he was appointed a Russian ambassador to NATO. As Russia's NATO envoy, he was heavily opposed to Ukraine and Georgia becoming members of NATO. After the two countries were denied membership of the NATO Membership Action Plan, he claimed, \"They will not invite these bankrupt scandalous regimes to join NATO... more so as important partnerships with Russia are at stake\". For such words, he was criticized by some Ukrainian and Georgian officials. A former Ukrainian envoy to NATO, Ihor Sahach, said, \"In my opinion, he is merely used as one of cogs in the informational war waged against Ukraine. Sooner or later, I think, it should be stopped\". The envoy also expressed a surprise with Rogozin's slang words: \"It was for the first time that I heard such a higher official as envoy using this, I don't even know how to describe it, whether it was a slang or language of criminal circles…. I understand Russian, but, I'm sorry, I don't know what his words meant\". The Foreign Minister of Ukraine Volodymyr Ohryzko stated that he did not regard the statement as serious.\n\nIn 2014, Rogozin was involved in several diplomatic conflicts following the 2014 Crimean crisis. He was added to the sanctions list by the US, Canada and the EU, and had conflicts with Romania, after Romania barred his plane from entering its airspace, and Moldova.\nIn May 2018, Putin selected Rogozin to be the head of Roscosmos, the Russian state space agency for two decades after the early 1990s and, in the past few years, transformed by Rogozin from a state agency into a state corporation.\n\nOn 17 March 2014, the day after the Crimean status referendum, Rogozin became one of the first seven people who were put under executive sanctions by US President Barack Obama. The sanctions froze his assets in the US and banned him from entering the country. He was also added to the Canadian and to the EU sanction list due to the Crimean crisis. In 2015, Rogozin stated that Russia's defence sector has \"many other ways of traveling the world besides tourist visas\" and \"tanks don't need visas\".\n\nOn 29 April 2014, he tweeted: \"After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest to the USA to bring their astronauts to the International Space Station using a trampoline\". On 31 May 2020, Elon Musk replied following the successful launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2, that \"the trampoline is working\".\n\nOn 10 May 2014, Rogozin started a diplomatic conflict between Romania and Russia after Romania barred his plane from entering its airspace. In response, he made two threatening posts on his Twitter account, one of which stated that next time, he would fly on board a Tu-160 bomber.\n\nInstead, on 28 July 2017, he boarded an S7 Airlines commercial flight to Chișinău, where he would meet Moldovan President Igor Dodon, but the Romanian government again denied permission for the plane to enter its airspace, citing the \"presence of a sanctioned person on board\". The Boeing 737-800 went on a holding pattern in Hungarian airspace for a while, but after Hungary denied permission for landing and ordered the plane to leave, it was decided to divert to Minsk, Belarus, outside of the EU, reportedly with barely enough fuel to reach there. The plane later flew to Chișinău with the remaining passengers, but without Rogozin. The Deputy Prime-Minister later tweeted: \"The Romanian authorities endangered the lives of passengers on an S7 flight, women and children. Fuel was [just] enough to [get to] Minsk. Wait for an answer, vermin!\" Asked about Rogozin's threat, Romanian National Defense Minister said: \"I don't think we need to make this a discussion, we would be in the wrong attempting to escalate by all sorts of statements the statements made by others. I believe it's wise to mind our business and see to our program.\"\n\nOn 2 August 2017, he was declared \"persona non grata\" by the Government of Moldova.\n\nIn October 2014, Rogozin wrote a foreword for a book, \"Alaska Betrayed and Sold: The History of a Palace Conspiracy\", by Ivan Mironov. In it Rogozin supported the author's claim that the sale of Alaska was a \"betrayal of Russian power status\". He also claimed in his writing that Russia had the \"right to reclaim our lost colonies\". Rogozin's opinion on Alaska came out right around the time that the state was preparing to observe the anniversary of the sale.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990971", "title": "Chest photofluorography", "text": "Chest photofluorography\n\nChest photofluorography, or abreugraphy (also called mass miniature radiography), is a photofluorography technique for mass screening for tuberculosis using a miniature (50 to 100 mm) photograph of the screen of an X-ray fluoroscopy of the thorax, first developed in 1936.\n\nAbreugraphy receives its name from its inventor, Dr. Manuel Dias de Abreu, a Brazilian physician and pulmonologist. It has received several different names, according to the country where it was adopted: mass radiography, miniature chest radiograph (United Kingdom and United States), roentgenfluorography (Germany), radiophotography (France), schermografia (Italy), photoradioscopy (Spain) and photofluorography (Sweden).\n\nIn many countries, miniature mass radiographs (MMR) was quickly adopted and extensively utilized in the 1950s. For example, in Brazil and in Japan, tuberculosis prevention laws went into effect, obligating ca. 60% of the population to undergo MMR screening. However, as a mass screening program for low-risk populations, the procedure was largely discontinued in the 1970s, following recommendation of the World Health Organization, due to three main reasons:\n\nMMR is still an easy and useful way to prevent transmission of the disease in certain situations, such as in prisons and for immigration applicants and foreign workers coming from countries with a higher risk for tuberculosis. Currently, 13 of the 26 European countries use MMR as the primary screening tool for this purpose. Examples of countries with permanent programs are Italy, Switzerland, Norway, Netherlands, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nFor example, a study in Switzerland between 1988 and 1990, employing abreugraphy to detect tuberculosis in 50,784 immigrants entering the canton of Vaud, discovered 674 foreign people with abnormalities. Of these, 256 had tuberculosis as the primary diagnosis and 34 were smear or culture-positive (5% of all radiological abnormalities).\n\nElderly populations are also a good target for MMR-based screening, because the radiation risk is less important and because they have a higher risk of tuberculosis (85 per 100,000 in developed countries, in the average). In Japan, for example, it is still used routinely, and the Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association (JATA) reported the detection of 228 cases in 965,440 chest radiographs in 1996 alone.\n\nMMR is most useful at detecting tuberculosis infection in the asymptomatic phase, and it should be combined with tuberculin skin tests and clinical questioning in order to be more effective. The sharp increase in tuberculosis in all countries with large exposure to HIV is probably mandating a return of MMR as a screening tool focusing on high-risk populations, such as homosexuals and intravenous drug users. New advances in digital radiography, coupled with much lower x-ray dosages may herald better MMR technologies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990972", "title": "Dundee Airport", "text": "Dundee Airport\n\nDundee Airport () is located from the centre of Dundee, Scotland or, for navigation purposes, south of the city. It lies on the shore of the Firth of Tay and overlooks the Tay Rail Bridge.\n\nDundee Airport is a popular transport hub for golf in Scotland, as it is the closest airport to the championship courses at St Andrews, Gleneagles and Carnoustie. During international competitions, the airport is often at its busiest with charter and private aircraft.\n\nThe airport was opened in 1963 on land reclaimed from the Firth of Tay. Originally it had a grass runway. The first scheduled air service began on 5 July 1966, with a service to Glasgow. A fortnight later a feeder service was added for Turnhouse and Prestwick. The service was stopped on 31 October 1967 after British Eagle reported £10,000 losses. Around this time the control of Dundee City Council changed from Labour to Conservative, and the airport was closed and the land used by Dundee University as playing fields. When control of the Council changed back again to Labour the airport was reopened.\n\nThe grass runway was replaced by a long tarmac runway in the 1970s, and extended to the current length of in the 1990s. The airport was granted \"customs airport\" status on 16 April 1982 and runway edge lights were added in 1983. The current terminal was opened in 1997 by the then EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock.\n\nDuring the 1980s Air Ecosse operated services to Aberdeen, Carlisle, Manchester, and Esbjerg using Short 330 and Short 360 aircraft. This included a 360 in the Royal Mail Special Services \"Datapost\" colour scheme.\n\nRamsay World Travel from Dundee also operated a weekly charter to Jersey in the summer months in association with Lewis's Holidays, and in 1996 they ran a series of weekly flights to Majorca using BAe 146 aircraft which had to land in Bournemouth/Southend to re-fuel.\n\nBusiness Air and later British Midland Regional operated flights from Dundee to Manchester Airport in the 1990s, a route that was brought back by Eastern Airways for only a few months, in 2002.\n\nAfter the departure of Business Air, the airport was left without any scheduled services for almost a year until April 1999, when ScotAirways introduced flights to London City Airport. ScotAirways operated under the CityJet banner for Air France from 2007 to September 2009. In September 2009 CityJet became a commercial brand within the AFKL Group. Flights were announced as CityJet and not Air France. The Dundee to London City route was flown by Dornier 328 aircraft leased from ScotAirways, until January 2011 when ScotAirways' near 12-year association with the route came to an end, as CityJet announced the route would be operated on a reduced frequency by its own Fokker 50 aircraft. This change caused concern within the business community for the continued viability of the route. Following the purchase of ScotAirways by Loganair in July 2011, the Dornier 328 was reinstated on the route.\n\nOn 29 May 2007, services to Birmingham and Belfast City operated by FlyWhoosh, using ATR 42 aircraft, started. The company, which was effectively only a ticket agent, used the services of a Polish airline White Eagle Aviation (WEA), which based an aircraft at Dundee Airport. In December 2007 these services ceased, amid some confusion as to what exactly caused the termination of services.\n\nOn 3 March 2008, Loganair announced that it would recommence the routes that had been operated by FlyWhoosh in May 2008, under the new Flybe franchise. Three weekday return flights were introduced between Dundee and Birmingham, with one return flight on Sundays and a daily weekday return flight between Dundee and Belfast City Airport, with one return flight also operating on Sundays. The company used Saab 340 aircraft on these routes.\n\nTayside Aviation operates a training facility and engineering workshop at the airport. This was supplemented by a maintenance hangar built in 1982. Their operations form the substantial part of the light aircraft movements at the airport, being, among other things, sole contractor to the Air Cadet Organisation to provide Light Aircraft Flying Scholarships to RAF cadets.\n\nDundee Airport had been operating at a loss of over £2 million per year from 2004 to 2007 and in the first full financial year of operation under HIAL, 2008/9, the airport's loss was £2.6 million.\n\nOn 12 February 2007 it was announced that, from September 2007, the City Council would hand over the running of the airport to Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL). The takeover took place on 1 December 2007.\n\nAny additional scheduled flights at the airport would be limited by runway length to regional aircraft. Larger aircraft used by low-cost airlines, such as Boeing 737s, require longer runways. The largest aircraft that can land at the airport are the BAe 146 and the Airbus A318.\n\nIn October 2012, Loganair announced the closure of flights to Belfast City and Birmingham on behalf of Flybe, citing poor load factors and high fuel costs as the reason for closure, leaving CityJet with its route to London-City as the only scheduled carrier in Dundee.\n\nIn December 2013, CityJet announced it would be dropping the last remaining scheduled route from Dundee to London City Airport in March 2014, putting the airport's future in doubt. However, on 22 January 2014, HIAL announced that Loganair would take over from CityJet and commence twice-daily flights to Stansted, once the London City route was withdrawn in March of the same year.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, HIAL and airport bosses announced that they were considering a direct air link to Amsterdam. In late October 2008, an article was placed in the \"Evening Telegraph\" concerning the possibility of flights to and from Spain. The airport operator had also stated that the A318 was fully compatible for Dundee Airport and could be used to operate these flights.\n\nIn 2016, Flybe announced Dundee's first direct international flight to Amsterdam, which started on 23 May 2016 and was operated with a 78-seater Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft. The initial 5-weekly return flight was funded through the regional connectivity fund, operating through the Department for Transport's public service obligation scheme.\n\nOn 19 November, Flybe suspended the route as part of a review of the airline's operations at Dundee Airport. All passengers booked on the route were transported to Edinburgh Airport and rebooked on a flight from Edinburgh to Amsterdam. The suspension was due to be lifted on 16 December; however, this did not materialise.\n\nIt was announced on Friday 23 December 2016 that the flights to Amsterdam would be cut in 2017, as Flybe believed that the radar coverage was not adequate. Flybe stated that it would return to Dundee only when an improved radar system was installed. While it is unlikely that an improved Secondary Surveillance Radar system will be installed, newer lower-cost technologies such as Multilateration and ADS-B are being investigated.\n\nMany local people questioned Flybe's decision to withdraw the flights when it was reported that flights were fully booked up until February 2017. Despite Flybe's decision to withdraw from Dundee, Loganair stated that it was still committed to Dundee Airport and may consider adding more flights in 2018. Loganair's franchise agreement with Flybe ended in September 2017. Experts said this would give Loganair more freedom to operate more flights, and speculated that Dundee would figure among these additional flights.\n\nThe airport lies on the main A85 Riverside Drive, which links the city centre to the Kingsway and the A90, with the airport approximately 3 kilometres from the city centre itself. Taxis are available from outside the airport.\n\nDundee Airport is a short taxi ride from the main Dundee bus station. Direct buses to many other major destinations are available from the station. Chartered buses can also be booked with local operators.\n\nThe airport is also a short drive from Dundee railway station. The station is situated on the East Coast Main Line to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Leeds and London, and is also on the Glasgow–Aberdeen line serving Glasgow and further afield. Dundee Station is served by ScotRail, London North Eastern Railway, the Caledonian Sleeper and CrossCountry.\n\n"}
{"id": "1990977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1990977", "title": "Judiciary of Texas", "text": "Judiciary of Texas\n\nThe structure of the judiciary of Texas is laid out in Article 5 of the Constitution of Texas and is further defined by statute, in particular the Texas Government Code and Texas Probate Code. The structure is complex, featuring many layers of courts, numerous instances of overlapping jurisdiction (in terms of territory), several differences between counties, as well as an unusual bifurcated appellate system at the top level found in only one other state: Oklahoma. Municipal Courts are the most active courts, with County Courts and District Courts handling most other cases and often sharing the same courthouse.\n\nAdministration is the responsibility of the Supreme Court of Texas, which is aided by the Texas Office of Court Administration, Texas Judicial Council and the State Bar of Texas, which it oversees. The State Bar of Texas (SBOT) is a mandatory bar, rather than merely a voluntary association of lawyers (such as the ABA or local bar associations). In order to practice law in Texas courts, an attorney must be licensed, must stay abreast of legal developments through CLE programs, and must pay dues. The public can obtain basic information on all Texas attorneys, including their bar number, license status, and disciplinary record, from the Bar's website.\n\nIn the 19th century, Texas had a reputation for arbitrary \"frontier justice\"; in one notorious example highlighted by Stanford legal historian Lawrence M. Friedman, its appellate courts upheld a conviction of \"guily\" (where the \"t\" was omitted) in 1879 but reversed a conviction of \"guity\" (where the \"l\" was omitted) in 1886. The latter decision actually attempted to distinguish the earlier one by trying to explain why the letter \"l\" was more important than the letter \"t\". The poor quality of the state's judicial system in the period has been attributed to its shortage of proper law schools and law libraries in those times, as well as the traditional preference of Texans for \"'self-help' justice as practiced in the courts of 'Judge Winchester' or 'Judge Lynch.'\"\n\nTexas is the only state besides Oklahoma to have a bifurcated appellate system at the highest level. The Texas Supreme Court hears appeals involving civil matters (which include juvenile cases), and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals hears appeals involving criminal matters. Sometimes, the dividing line is murky, especially with respect to jurisdiction in mandamus and habeas corpus cases. See, e.g. Justice Willett's dissent in In re Reece, 341 S.W.3d 360 (Tex. 2011) (orig. proceeding). Unlike its counterpart in Oklahoma, the Texas Supreme Court is not really supreme when it comes to a jurisdictional ping-pong or tug-of-war between the two high courts because both are co-equal.\n\nArticle V, Section 1, states:\n\nAs such, the Texas Legislature has created additional courts to address caseload pressures driven by population growth in different areas of the state. District courts are (usually) consecutively numbered regardless of whether they are specialize to handle criminal, civil, or family matters (though in some counties, Criminal District Courts have separate numbering systems, an example being Dallas County which has seven such courts numbered 1 through 11). The highest numbers indicate that the court was created recently, but the number alone provides no clue as to location of the new court and the appellate district within which it is located. As such, a comprehensive list of Dallas courts can be found to include 60 courts in Dallas.\n\nFurther sections of Article V spell out the basic requirements for each court's jurisdiction and for its officers.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court hears appeals involving civil matters and does not hear any appeals involving criminal matters except when the defendant is a juvenile. Under Texas law, juvenile proceedings (even those involving criminal activity) are considered civil matters under the Texas Family Code; thus, the Texas Supreme Court hears such appeals, but it defers to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) in matters where the Texas Penal Code must be interpreted. The Supreme Court also maintains responsibility for attorney licensing and discipline, and plays a more prominent role in promulgation and revision of court rules and in administration of the entire judicial system that does the CCA. \n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals hears appeals in criminal cases excluding those involving juveniles. Cases in which the death penalty was imposed are directly and automatically appealed to this court, bypassing the intermediate Courts of Appeals, which hear both civil and criminal cases.\n\nTexas has 14 Courts of Appeals, which have intermediate appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases. Death penalty cases, however, are automatically appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and thus skip the intermediate tier in the appellate court hierarchy. The term Court of Appeals (plural) should be capitalized because the generic term would include the two courts of last resorts also. \n\nThe total number of intermediate appellate seats is 80, with membership ranging from three to 13 justices per court, as set by statute. All cases are heard by a three-justice panel unless a hearing \"en banc\" is ordered (except where a particular court has only three justices assigned to it, in which instance all cases are automatically heard \"en banc\"; an example is the 12th Court of Appeals). The \"en banc\" process is used to maintain consistency in the court's jurisprudence, to overrule existing precedent that is binding on individual panels, and to set new precedent on an unsettled question of substantive law or procedure.\n\nThe Texas Legislature determines which counties are included within a particular court of appeals' district, and has shifted counties between courts to balance the docket. The Texas Supreme Court seeks to even out imbalances in appellate caseloads on an ongoing basis with docket-equalization orders that provide for transfers of batches of cases from the busiest appeals courts to others with spare capacity. \n\nThe First and the Fourteenth Courts of Appeal present a peculiarity: both have their seat at the re-purposed historic 1910 Harris County Courthouse in Houston and exercise concurrent jurisdiction over the same ten counties, the largest of which is Harris County. Parties who want to appeal a judgment or other order from a trial court in these counties are required to state in their notice of appeal that they wish to appeal to either the First or the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, and then have to wait for the result of random assignment to one or the other. They also have to disclose any prior appellate history of the same case in either one of the two courts. Both courts are served by the same clerk, currently Christopher Prine, whose office will issue an initial letter with instructions, along with the appellate docket number that will also reveal which court an appellant has drawn. Appeals are governed by the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (TRAPs) and the local rules. \n\nAn even more bizarre situation occurs in East and North Texas, where the 6th Court has four counties – Gregg, Rusk, Upshur, and Wood – which overlap with the 12th Court, and also has Hunt County overlapping with the 5th Court.\n\nThe Texas district courts are the trial courts of general jurisdiction.\n\nThe district court has exclusive jurisdiction over felony cases, cases involving title to land, and election contest cases. It shares jurisdiction with the county courts, and in some case justice of the peace courts, for civil cases (its lowest limit for hearing a case is a mere $200 in controversy, while JP courts can hear cases up to $10,000). Family law jurisdiction varies depending on the existence of a county court-at-law; in some counties, the district courts share jurisdiction over divorces, child custody and support matters, adoptions and child welfare cases with county courts at law. Probate jurisdiction varies, depending on the existence of a statutory probate court in the county. In some larger counties, such as Harris County, the district courts are specialized, with designated sets of courts hearing criminal cases, juvenile cases, family matters, and non-family civil cases in four different court houses surrounding the square with the underground jury assembly facility, which suffered severe flood damage in Hurricane Harvey. In the smaller counties, a single district court handles all types of cases. In rural areas, as many as five counties share a single district court; urban counties.\n\nOne of the most unusual features of Texas trial courts, including district courts, is the tradition of having only one judge per trial court. Single-judge trial courts were the dominant form of American state trial court organization well into the late 19th century. According to Roscoe Pound, 23 of the 34 states in the Union adhered to that model on the eve of the American Civil War. Accordingly, in 1836, this then-commonplace and familiar model was duly written into the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. Section 2 of Article IV provided for \"not less than three nor more than eight\" judicial districts, and that \"a judge\" would be appointed for each district. Similar clauses using the indefinite article to imply one judge per court appeared in all subsequent constitutions. For example, Section 7 of Article V of the 1876 state constitution provided for 26 judicial districts (subject to the right of the Legislature to increase or diminish them), and that \"a judge\" would be elected for each district. This rigid constitutional language was finally fixed by a constitutional amendment in 1985, but by then, the tradition of one judge per court was thoroughly entrenched.\n\nAs a result, instead of adding more judges to existing courts in response to population growth, the Texas Legislature adds more courts. In February 1889, the Legislature tried to constitutionally meet the need for two district court judges in both Dallas and Bexar Counties by dividing each county into two districts, running the district boundary through the middle of the county courthouse, and granting each district court concurrent jurisdiction over the entire county. The Dallas County courthouse burned down on January 7, 1890, and both district courts reopened a month later in temporary rented quarters which were entirely inside of the 44th District. This arrangement was immediately challenged, and in response, the Texas Supreme Court ruled on March 12, 1890 that the state constitution did not prohibit both Dallas County district courts from operating from a shared location inside the same district. This is why today, a typical Texas urban courthouse is home to many single-judge trial courts of concurrent jurisdiction over the same county, each of which is legally organized as a \"separate\" court with its own unique name and number. In contrast, in virtually all other U.S. states and the federal government, a trial court can have multiple judges sitting in separate departments who all share coequal authority to act in the name of the same trial court. \n\nEach district court is uniquely numbered on a statewide basis according to its sequence of creation by the Legislature (in other words, the numbers do not reflect the courts' geography). The same is not true of county-level courts, which are numbered sequentially in individual counties. \n\nThe first Texas state constitution of 1845 tried to ameliorate the inflexibility of a single-judge trial court model by also authorizing judges to \"exchange benches or hold court for each other when they deem it expedient.\" Relying on this language, the Legislature enacted a variety of procedural laws over the years to get as close as possible to a \"de facto\" unified district court in the urban counties that needed multiple district judges, while remaining faithful to the constitutionally mandated structure of single-judge trial courts. However, these procedures are still not as flexible as simply merging all judges in a county into a single district court, and purported failures to properly follow such procedures occasionally result in another basis for appeal.\n\nLarge counties typically assign newly filed lawsuits randomly to individual courts to defeat efforts at judge-shopping (a form of forum-shopping), and require re-filed cases involving the same parties to be transferred back to the original randomly-drawn court. Some of these multi-court jurisdictions (e.g., Bexar County/San Antonio) use a centralized docket system, which undercuts the ability to predict which judge will hear a particular motion or try a case, because the assignment of the matter will depend on the availability of judges on a given day. In that system all cases retain their formal assignment to a particular court. The centralized docket system is, at least in principle, more efficient in allocation of judicial resources, and is legally feasible because trial judges in counties with multiple courts are authorized to switch benches and sit for each other. In appeals from such local court systems, the number of the district court provides no clue as to who signed the judgment. The judge must instead be identified by name. Additionally different orders in the same case may have been signed by different judges.\n\nIn another unique twist, the Constitution grants the Legislature the authority to determine which court handles probate matters. Thus, in ten of the 15 largest counties (specifically, the counties of Bexar, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Galveston, Harris, Hidalgo, Tarrant, and Travis) the Legislature has established one or more Statutory Probate Courts. These specialized courts handle matters of probate, guardianship, trust, and mental health. In some counties, the statutory probate courts also hear condemnation cases. There are no jurisdictional monetary limits on the types of lawsuits that a statutory probate court may hear. As such, their jurisdiction at times overlaps that of the district court.\n\nNot to be confused with County Courts at Law, which are created by statute, there is a County Court for each of the 254 counties in Texas. The Texas Constitution states that \"[t]here shall be established in each county in this State a County Court ...\" Sections 15 through 17 of Article V, as well as Chapters 25 and 26 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.\n\nThe county court has exclusive jurisdiction over \"Class A\" and \"Class B\" misdemeanors (these offenses can involve jail time), concurrent jurisdiction over civil cases where the amount in controversy is moderately sized, and appellate jurisdiction over JP and municipal court cases (for municipal court cases, this may involve a trial \"de novo\" if the lower court is not a \"court of record\").\n\nCounty court judges are not required to be licensed attorneys. Due to this, defendants in counties which only have the traditional constitutional county court may ask to have their cases transferred to that county's district court for trial if the district judge consents . However, defendants in counties with the county court at law structure do not have this option, as the county court at law judges are required to have law degrees.\n\nSection 15 states that the County Court shall be a \"court of record\". Section 16 states that the County Court \"has jurisdiction as provided by law\"; Section 17 states that the County Court shall hold terms as provided by law and that County Court juries shall consist of six persons, but in civil cases a jury shall not be empaneled unless one of the parties demands it and pays a jury fee or files an affidavit stating that it is unable to do so.\n\nSince the county judge is also responsible for presiding over the Commissioners Court (the main executive and legislative body of the county), in 94 counties the Texas Legislature has established county courts at law to relieve the county judge of judicial duties. The first multi-county statutory county court (composed of Fisher, Mitchell, and Nolan counties) was created in 2013. In most counties with courts at law, the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the constitutional county court has been transferred to the county courts at law. Unlike the county judge, judges of the county courts of law are required to be attorneys. The county courts at law may hear both civil and criminal matters, or hear them separately, depending on how the Legislature has structured them (Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Harris, and Tarrant counties have \"county criminal courts\" or \"county criminal courts at law\" that hear only criminal cases).\n\nStatutory County Courts at Law, not to be confused with Constitutional County Courts, generally have broader jurisdiction than constitutional county courts. Statutory County Courts can generally entertain lawsuits in which the amount in controversy is over $500 but not over $200,000. However, unlike constitutional county courts, the jurisdiction of Statutory County Courts can vary from county to county. For example, in Dallas County, Statutory County Courts have jurisdiction nearly as broad as that of District Courts. In Harris County, the genera jurisdictional cap is $200,000 but these courts also have exclusive jurisdiction of eminent domain proceedings regardless of the amount in controversy. In Travis County, the amount in controversy for matters the Statutory County Court can entertain ranges from $500 to $250,000. There is no clear policy reason for the varying jurisdictions of the Statutory County Courts.\n\nUnder the authority granted it by Section 1 of Article V, the Legislature has allowed for the creation of municipal courts in each incorporated city in Texas, by voter approval creating such court. Chapters 29 and 30 of the Texas Government Code outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.\n\nMunicipal courts in Texas come into contact with more defendants than all other Texas courts combined. The subject matter of municipal courts relates to crimes relating to public safety and quality of life issues. In recent years, municipal courts and justice court in Texas have become the primary venue for acts of misconduct committed by children.\n\nWithin the city limits, these courts have shared jurisdiction with the JP courts on Class C criminal misdemeanor cases, and have exclusive jurisdiction on cases involving city ordinances. Municipal courts have limited civil jurisdiction over public matters relating to public safety (e.g., dangerous dog determinations). Confusion surrounding a municipal court's civil jurisdiction is complicated that if a municipal court is a \"court of record,\" the Legislature has authorized municipalities to adopt ordinances that give municipal courts concurrent jurisdiction over substandard building cases with county and/or district courts. The matter of civil jurisdiction has been further confused by the advent of civil penalties for conduct that can be prosecuted as a Class C misdemeanor (e.g. certain parking violations, red light camera violations).\n\nAs a general rule, the municipal courts are not \"courts of record\" (i.e., no court reporter recorded and transcribed the proceedings), and thus an appeal to the county level would require a whole new trial (i.e., a trial \"de novo\"). This proved to be a loophole for some defendants in traffic cases, who betted on the officer not being able to attend, and thus having the case dismissed. Furthermore, the de novo trials crowded the dockets of already busy county courts at law. Many major cities—such as those in Austin, El Paso, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio—have chosen to convert their municipal courts to courts of record (this also requires voter approval) to close this loophole.\n\nMunicipal court cases are generally appealed to the county court level, but cannot be appealed beyond that level unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.\n\nThe lowest court level in Texas is the Justice of the Peace Court (also called Justice Court or JP Court). Each county has at least one JP Court. Sections 18 and 19 of Article V, as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.\n\nSection 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court:\n\nJP cases are appealed to the county court level where the case results in a trial de novo. The perfection of the appeal vacates the judgment of the JP court, which means that the higher court does not reverse or affirm the JP court when it resolves the appeal. The case is instead retried on appeal, but the jurisdictional limits of the JP court, rather than those of the court of record, apply. Appeals from JP court also differ from appeals to the courts of appeals in that they require the posting of bond. This makes such appeals more onerous to losing defendants than appeals from county courts to the court of appeals unless the defendant qualifies to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\nIn criminal cases, cases beginning in justice court cannot be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.\n\nUnder Section 18, the number of JP's (and associated constables; each county has as many constables as JP's) is dependent on the size of the county:\n\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has constitutional responsibility for the efficient administration of the judicial system and possesses the authority to make rules of administration applicable to the courts in addition to promulgation and amend rules governing procedure in trial and appellate courts, and rules of evidence. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, presiding judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals, chief justices of each of the 14 courts of appeals, and judges of each of the trial courts are generally responsible for the administration of their respective courts.\n\nThere is a local administrative district judge in each county, as well as a local administrative statutory county court judge in each county that has a statutory county court. In counties with two or more district courts, a local administrative district judge is elected by the district judges in the county for a term not to exceed two years; in counties with two or more statutory county courts, a local administrative statutory county court judge is elected by the statutory county court judges for a term not to exceed two years. The local administrative judge is charged with implementing the local rules of administration, supervising the expeditious movement of court caseloads, and other administrative duties.\n\neFileTexas.gov is the official electronic court filing (e-filing) system. Each county maintains (or does not maintain) their own docket management and retrieval systems, similar to PACER for the federal government. There is no longer an officially published reporter. \"West's Texas Cases\" (a Texas-specific version of the \"South Western Reporter\") includes reported opinions of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Courts of Appeals. The \"Texas Reports\" includes Supreme Court opinions until July 1962, and the \"Texas Criminal Reports\" includes Court of Criminal Appeals opinions until November 1962. There is no systematic reporting of decisions of trial courts. Court opinions can generally be freely accessed on the web from the various courts' websites, with appellate opinions generally being available from 1997–2002 onwards.\n\nIn 2014 the Texas Court of Appeals's web sites were updated and migrated to new web addresses (with automatic forwarding from the old URLs). Each court's website allows for case and opinion searches using various types of input in addition to cause number, such as party name, attorney name, attorney bar number, file date/date range, and full-text search using key words. All current opinion are now released as pdf documents, rather than html, and thus standardized, although different courts use different templates and citation/footnoting styles, which makes for some degree of variation in appearance. Additionally, courts of appeals are now also making procedural orders, briefs, and motions available online. The record on appeal, consisting of the Clerk's Record and the Reporter's Record, however, is generally not posted online even if the parties' briefs are.\n\nAppellate opinions are also available through Google Scholar. Google Scholar presents them in a format that is more user-friendly for online viewing (compared to the double-spaced PDFs in small font released by the courts), hotlinks cited cases, and provides other functionality, such as identification of subsequent citing cases and ranking of search results by relevancy or time (recency) and time-frame delimited searches. Google Scholar versions now also include attorney information for each decided case, but they do not (as of May 2018) provide a hotlink to the appellate dockets, which would be a very useful additional feature. Google instead uses the hot-linked cause numbers internally to link opinions in a case with the procedural orders issued in the same case that are also included in its database. By clicking the cause number, all documents available for a particular case in the Google Scholar database can be displayed on a search results page, and can be sorted into reverse chronological order if desired.\n\nThe Texas Judicial Council is the primary policy-making body for the judiciary. It is responsible for studying and recommending changes to improve the administration of justice. The Administrative Director of the Office of Court Administration serves as Executive Director for the Council.\n\nThe Texas Office of Court Administration provides information and research, technology services, budgetary and legal support, and other administrative assistance to a variety of judicial branch entities and courts, under the supervision of the Supreme Court of Texas and the Chief Justice. The office is led by an Administrative Director appointed by the Supreme Court and reporting to the Chief Justice.\n\nThe State Bar of Texas (the Texas Bar) is an agency of the judiciary under the administrative control of the Texas Supreme Court. The Texas Bar is responsible for assisting the Texas Supreme Court in overseeing all attorneys licensed to practice law in Texas.\n\nIn Texas, state judges are elected in partisan elections. Trial judges are elected for 4 years, and appellate court judges are elected for 6 years. The Governor fills vacancies until the next election, and judges traditionally leave office before their last term is completed.\n\nAll state-wide elective positions in the executive and judicial branch are currently controlled by Republicans because the state as a whole is solidly red. Appellate and trial court judges, however, are elected from districts, and some of those districts are more competitive than Texas as a whole, and some even have a clear Democratic majority.\n\nIn the November 6, 2018 midterm elections numerous Republican appellate justices lost to Democratic challengers, entailing in a switch from Republican to Democratic majority control effective January 1, 2019 in Dallas and in the two Courts of Appeals in Houston, and major changes in the partisan makeup of other courts, including Austin and San Antonio.\n\nThere are other scenarios that can result in turnover on benches, but they are rare. Judges may be removed by voters in retention elections, by trial by jury, or by legislative address or impeachment if state judges.\nThe predominant source of change in the composition of the judiciary involves politics.\n\nSome incumbent judges/justices who seek reelection are defeated in primary elections, others in general elections. The probability of election-driven turnover on district and appellate benches is affected by the nature of the concurrent elections (presidential or mid-term) and by partisan tides, at least in the more competitive counties and appellate districts, e.g. Dallas and Harris County/Houston (county-level) and San Antonio (appellate district level).\n\nIn 2006, several dozen Republican incumbents were swept off their benches by Democrats in Dallas County, and in 2008, many incumbents lost in Harris County.\n\nDistrict court judges are required to be licensed attorneys. In addition to judicial powers, district judges also have administrative duties as well. District judges may remove county officials , officials of a general-law municipality , and municipal court judges under certain circumstances. Also, they appoint and supervise the county auditor, oversee the operations of the adult and juvenile probation offices, and are granted \"supervisory\" jurisdiction over the county commissioners court.\n\nCounty judges do not need to be lawyers, and most are not. Sections 15 through 17 of Article V, as well as Chapters 25 and 26 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of County Court officers. Section 15 states that the county judge shall be \"well informed in the law of the State\", \"a conservator of the peace\", and shall be elected for a four-year term. The county judge is also responsible for presiding over the Commissioners Court (the main executive and legislative body of the county). County court at law judges are required to be lawyers.\n\nIn one of the odd provisions of the Texas Government Code, there is no requirement that a municipal judge be an attorney if the municipal court is not a court of record (Chapter 29, Section 29.004), but the municipal judge must be a licensed attorney with at least two years experience in practicing Texas law if the municipal court is a court of record (Chapter 30, Section 30.00006). The Code provides for differing requirements for municipal judges in certain cities, such as:\n\n\nThe thirteen-member Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct hears complaints against judges, and may censure, reprimand, or recommend removal by the Supreme Court. It very rarely punishes judges; out of more than 1,110 complaints it resolved in fiscal year 2009, only 70 disciplinary actions were taken.\n\nThere is no requirement that the JP be an attorney. However, the Texas Government Code requires a JP to attend an 80-hour course involving the performance of JP duties within one year after initial election, and a 20-hour course every year thereafter. In addition, the JP is an \"ex officio\" notary public.\n\nA \"magistrate\" can be any judge or JP and can set bonds, arraign defendants, issue search and arrest warrants, and conduct criminal bond forfeiture hearings. Five counties (Bexar, Dallas, Lubbock, Tarrant, and Travis) have district court magistrates who are appointed by district court judges and do not conduct trials.\n\nThere are several prosecution offices: district attorneys, county attorneys, criminal district attorneys, and city attorneys. District attorneys prosecute criminal cases in district courts and serve one or more counties in which they are elected for four-year terms. County attorneys prosecute misdemeanor criminal cases and serve a single county in which they are elected for four-year terms. Criminal district attorneys prosecute both felony and misdemeanor criminal cases and serve a single county in which they are elected for four-year terms. City attorneys prosecute criminal cases in municipal courts. If a county has only a district attorney or county attorney, this official prosecutes all criminal cases within the county.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1991008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991008", "title": "Henry Cotton (doctor)", "text": "Henry Cotton (doctor)\n\nHenry Andrews Cotton (18 May 1876 – 8 May 1933) was an American psychiatrist and the medical director of New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton (now the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital, previously the New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum) in Trenton, New Jersey from 1907 to 1930. \n\nHe and his staff practiced experimental surgical bacteriology on patients, including the routine removal of some or all of patients' teeth, their tonsils, and frequently spleens, colons, ovaries, and other organs. These practices continued long after careful statistical reviews falsified Cotton's claims of extraordinarily high cure rates, and demonstrated very high mortality and morbidity as a result of these aggressive and dangerous measures. After becoming medical director of Trenton State Hospital at the age of 30, Cotton instituted many progressive ideas. These included abolishing mechanical restraints and implementing meetings of daily staff to thrash out patient care.\n\nHis enthusiasm for the scientific medicine that was taking hold at the opening of the 20th century led him to an unshakable belief that mental illness of all kinds was the result of untreated infections in the body. Based on the observation that patients with high fever often turn delusional or begin hallucinating, Meyer introduced the possibility of mental illness (then viewed as the cutting edge concept of scientific medicine) being a biological cause of behavioral abnormalities, in contrast to eugenic theories which emphasized heredity and to Freud's theories of childhood traumas. Cotton would become the leading practitioner of the new approach in the United States.\n\nHenry A. Cotton had studied in Europe under Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer, considered the pioneers of the day, and was a student of Dr. Adolf Meyer of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who dominated American psychiatry in the early 1900s. He studied medicine at Johns Hopkins University and at University of Maryland.\nCotton began to implement the emerging medical theory of infection-based psychological disorders by pulling patients' teeth, as they were suspected of harboring infections. If this failed to cure a patient, he sought sources of infection in tonsils and sinuses and often a tonsillectomy was recommended as additional treatment. If a cure was not achieved after these procedures, other organs were suspected of harboring infection. Testicles, ovaries, gall bladders, stomachs, spleens, cervixes, and especially colons were suspected as the focus of infection and were removed surgically.\n\nBeing before even rudimentary scientific methods such as control groups—and by extension, double-blind experiments—existed, statistical methodology for applications in human behavior and medical research did not emerge during the lifetime of Cotton. He could only follow faulty methods to compile data, much of it allowing for projection of anticipated results. He reported wonderful success with his procedures, with cure rates of 85%; this, in conjunction with the feeling at the time that investigating such biological causes was the state of the art of medicine, brought him a great deal of attention, and worldwide praise. He was honored at medical institutions and associations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe and asked to make presentations about his work and to share information with the others who practiced the same or similar methods. Patients, or their families, begged to be treated at Trenton, and those who could not, demanded that their own doctors treat them with these new wonder cures. The state acknowledged the savings in expenses to taxpayers from the new treatments and cures. In June 1922, the \"New York Times\" wrote in a review of Cotton's published lectures:\n\nAt the State Hospital at Trenton, N.J., under the brilliant leadership of the medical director, Dr. Henry A. Cotton, there is on foot the most searching, aggressive, and profound scientific investigation that has yet been made of the whole field of mental and nervous disorders... there is hope, high hope... for the future.\n\nUnfortunately, in an era before antibiotics surgery resulted in a very high rate of postoperative morbidity and mortality, largely from postoperative infection. Among his patients at this time was Margaret Fisher, daughter of wealthy and famed Yale economist Irving Fisher, who believed in the hygienic movement of the period. Diagnosed by physicians in Bloomingdale Asylum as schizophrenic, which was before the modern development of some pharmaceutical agents, Fisher had his daughter transferred to Trenton. However, because Cotton attributed her condition to a \"marked retention of fecal matter in the cecal colon with marked enlargement of the colon in this area\" for which she was subjected to a series of colonic surgeries before dying of a streptococcal infection in 1919. The danger of surgery was recognized by some patients in the institution, who, despite their mental illness, developed a very rational fear of the surgical procedures, some resisting violently as they were forced into the operating theater in complete contradiction of what are now commonly accepted medical ethics. A paternalistic attitude and the permission of the family of seriously insane patients was the basis of intervention at the time.\n\nDifferences of professional opinion existed among psychiatrists regarding focal sepsis as a cause of psychosis and not all believed in the benefits of surgical intervention to achieve cures. Dr. Meyer, head of the most respected psychiatric clinic and training institution for psychiatrists in the United States, at Johns Hopkins University, accepted the theory. He was encouraged by a like-minded member of the state board of trustees who oversaw Trenton State Hospital to provide an independent professional review of the work of Cotton's staff. Meyer commissioned another of his former students who practiced psychiatry on his staff at the Phipps Clinic, Dr. Phyllis Greenacre, to critique Cotton's work. Her study began in the fall of 1924 just after Meyer visited the hospital and privately had expressed concern about the statistical methods being applied to provide an assessment of Cotton's work. Cotton's staff made no effort to facilitate the study.\n\nFrom the outset, Greenacre's reports were critical, with regard to both the hospital, which she felt was as unwholesome as the typical asylum, and Cotton, whom she found \"singularly peculiar\". She realized that the appearance and behavior of almost all of the psychotic patients was disturbing to her because their teeth had been removed, making it difficult for them to eat or speak. Further reports cast serious doubt on Cotton's reported results; she found the staff records to be chaotic and the data to be internally contradictory. In 1925 criticism of the hospital reached the New Jersey State Senate, which launched an investigation with testimony from unhappy former patients and employees of the hospital. Countering the criticism, the trustees of the hospital confirmed their confidence in the staff and director, and presented extensive professional praise of the hospital and the procedures followed under the direction of Cotton, whom they considered a pioneer. On September 24, 1925, \"The New York Times\" stated that, \"eminent physicians and surgeons testified that the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane was the most progressive institution in the world for the care of the insane, and that the newer method of treating the insane by the removal of focal infection placed the institution in a unique position with respect to hospitals for the mentally ill\" and related accolades given in support of Henry A. Cotton by many professionals and politicians.\n\nSoon Cotton opened a private hospital in Trenton which did a hugely lucrative business treating mentally ill members of rich families seeking the most modern treatments for their conditions. Meyer reassigned Greenacre without completing her report and resisted her efforts to complete the report. Admitting a shared belief in the possibility that focal sepsis might be the source of mental illness, Meyer never pressed his protégé to confront the scientific analysis of the erroneous statistics the hospital staff provided to Cotton, his silence guaranteeing continuance of the practices. Later Cotton would occasionally admit to death rates as high as 30% in his published papers. It appears that the true death rates were closer to 45% and that Cotton never fully recognized the errors his staff made in analyzing his work.\n\nIn October 1930, Cotton was retired from the state hospital and was appointed medical director emeritus. Although this ended the abominable surgeries which were so dangerous before the discovery of antibiotics, the hospital continued to adhere to Cotton's humane treatment guidelines and, to carry out his less risky medical procedures until the late 1950s. Henry A. Cotton continued to direct the staff at Charles Hospital until his death.\n\nIn the early 1930s Cotton's rate of postoperative mortality began to be a matter of professional debate in the state department of institutions by some concerned that he intended to press to resume his position at the state hospital. Another report on Cotton's work was begun in 1932 by Emil Frankel. He noted that he had seen Greenacre's report and agreed with it substantially, but his report also failed to be completed.\n\nHenry A. Cotton died suddenly of a heart attack on May 8, 1933 in Trenton, New Jersey and was lauded in \"The New York Times\" and the local press, as well as international professional publications, for having been a pioneer seeking a better path for the treatment of the patients in mental hospitals.\n\nA fictionalized Dr. Cotton was portrayed by actor John Hodgman in the Cinemax drama \"The Knick\" in 2014.\n\nHe gives Gillian Darmody a major, and traumatic, surgery in the last episode of \"Boardwalk Empire\".\n\nThe story of Dr. Cotton was subjected to comedic treatment on the podcast \"The Dollop\" episode 290.\n\n\n\n"}

Following a move to Dallas, the two hooked up with former New Bohemian guitarist Wes Martin who brought them into Steve Curry's SRC Studios in Garland, TX. Along with Brutal Juice drummer Ben Burt, the group—with Martin on bass—recorded a clutch of songs that would come to be known as \"Scuzzy Ports\". Although never released, the eight-track demo soon attracted the attention of major labels on the West Coast. Enlisting the aid of recently departed Toadies guitarist Darrel Herbert and Chomsky keyboardist John Norris, Gibson and Scholz—who took the \"nom de rock\" \"Jody Powerchurch\"—quickly wrote enough songs for a set and played their first show at Club Dada in Dallas on November 18, 1996.\n\nTheir wildly erratic stage shows featured liberal use of old 16mm films and projections courtesy of Gordon and Jody's neighbor Michael Allen as well as live deployment of electronics and samples.\n\nThe group signed with Geffen Records, home of Nirvana, Sonic Youth and Beck, in 1998 and recorded an album's worth of material with former Brave Combo and Tripping Daisy drummer Mitch Marine. However a shift in power at the label resulted in the group departing Geffen before the album was mastered.\n\nFollowing the departure of Ben Burt, Bill Shupp officially took over drumming chores. Multi-instrumentalist Don Cento was recruited when Herbert and Norris left in 1999. For the group's 2008 incarnation, musicians Gary Parks and Hayes Smith came aboard on guitar and bass, respectively.\n\nThe group released two CDs, 1997's \"Golden Energy\" on Last Beat/Slab records and 1999's \"Marijuana Beach\"—a mini album of demos and unreleased tracks from their aborted 1998 Geffen set. Several other songs have appeared on compilations and promos.

{"id": "1991018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991018", "title": "Riedesel", "text": "Riedesel\n\nRiedesel is a German family name that began to appear in legal documents in the early 13th century. They were of the knightly class, though not all had the official status of \"Ritter\" or knight. Its exact geographical and temporal origins are uncertain. However, all of the early references are from the area of Hesse, and many served as vassals of the Margrave of Hesse in Marburg. In later centuries, the men served a wide variety of higher nobility as men-at-arms, administrators, and counselors.\n\nLines of the family are known to have had residences and offices throughout Hesse including Frankfurt, Josbach, Camberg, Bellersheim, Melsungen, as well as in Westphalia. The names employed typically used \"zu\" to designate their main residence, e.g. the \"Wappen\" (coat of arms) of Krafft Riedesel zu Josbach dating from 1523 still hang in the church of Saint Elisabeth in Marburg. Following the example of the Margrave of Hesse to whom they were vassals, the Riedesels were early converts to the Lutheran faith.\n\nWith one significant exception, the various lines of Riedesel knights either died out in the male line by the early 17th century or disappeared into the ranks of unfree peasants. Without hereditary lands, they were dependent on fiefs from higher nobility in exchange for their services.\n\nThe exception was the line of Riedesels based in Melsungen. Hermann II (1407–1463) of this line married Margareta von Röhrenfurth after establishing himself as an able knight and adviser in the service of Landgrave Ludwig. Hermann took possession of \"Schloss\" Eisenbach near Lauterbach (Hesse), as well as other lands and rights. He also took over the office of \"Erbmarschall zu Hessen\" (hereditary counselor to the Hessian courts). With this achievement, the Riedesels of Melsungen-Eisenbach had a permanent, hereditary financial base. Their holdings were substantial in comparison with those of most free knights, but still quite minor within the patchwork of German states, secular and ecclesiastical.\n\nIn 1680, five of the male Riedesels were granted the title of \"Freiherr zu Eisenbach\" by the German Emperor, with that title passing to all of their male descendants who reached majority. The title is usually translated as \"Baron\" in English. The common property of the family was governed by complex arrangements that have kept it intact. Nevertheless, few had enough income to support the lifestyle of even minor nobility without entering the service of greater powers in their armies or administration. Some continued to live around Lauterbach, but many others resided elsewhere.\n\nThe best-known member of the family, in the English-speaking world at least, is probably General Friedrich Adolph Riedesel, Freiherr zu Eisenbach (1738–1800). Erroneously known to American historians as \"von Riedesel\", he commanded a regiment of soldiers from the Duchy of Braunschweig as part of the British forces during the American Revolution.\n\nThe noble Riedesels lost their sovereignty (and feudal rents and services) in the wake of the Napoleonic wars, so pursued other enterprises included brewing and forestry.\n\nFar more numerous in Germany and in America are Riedesels who clearly do not descend from the Riedesel Freiherren zu Eisenbach. Their traceable history begins around 1600 in the former Counties (Grafschaften) of Wittgenstein, immediately west of Hesse. A suggested ancestor was from the Riedesel zu Josbach line and settled in Wittgenstein perhaps a century earlier. No member of the Wittgenstein Riedesels is better known than the master builder Mannus Riedesel (1662–1726). The name and the variant of 'Rietesel' were also known among commoners in Vorpommern/Western Pomerania around Stralsund.\n\nThe history of the Riedesel zu Eisenbach has been thoroughly researched and documented in a series of volumes. \n\n1. \"Vom ersten Auftreten des Namens bis zum Tode Hermanns III.

Boats leave daily from the Gateway of India, taking about an hour each way. The tickets for these can be bought at the Gateway itself. The first ferry leaves at 9 am and the last at 2 pm. From the boat landing stage on the island, a walkway leads to steps that go up to the famous caves.\n\nThere is also a narrow-gauge toy train from the boat area on the dock to the base of the steps leading up to the caves (about 600 meters). Along the path, hawkers sell souvenirs like necklaces, anklets, showpieces and keychains. There are also stalls to buy food and drinks. Small monkeys play along the sides of the path, occasionally thieving items from the hawkers, trashcans and tourists.\n\nMumbai Port Trust (MbPT) has plans to connect the island from Haji Bunder, Mumbai via Ropeway. Once built, it will take only 14 minutes to reach the UNESCO World Heritage Site whereas currently ferry takes about an hour.\n\nKnown in ancient times as \"Gharapuri\", the name \"Elephanta island\" (), was given by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, after seeing a monolithic basalt sculpture of an elephant found near the entrance. They decided to take it home but ended up dropping it into the sea because their chains were not strong enough. Later, this sculpture was moved to the Victoria gardens and then the Victoria and Albert Museum (now Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum) in Mumbai, by the British. This island was once the capital of a powerful local kingdom.\nIn Manuscript F by Leonardo da Vinci (kept at the Library de France) there is a note in which he says \"Map of Elephanta in India which Antonello the haberdasher has.\" It is unclear who this Florentine traveller Antonello might have been.\n\nThe island has an area of . It is located at approximately . The area comes under the jurisdiction of the Raigad district in Maharashtra.\n\nThe island is thickly wooded with palm, mango, and tamarind trees.\n\nIt has a population of about 1,200. The inhabitants are mainly involved in growing rice, fishing and repairing boats. There are two British-era cannons at the top. Quite recently, a small dam has been built so as to hold rainwater but that part of the island is privately owned and not accessible for tourists.\n\nThere are a total of three villages: Shentbandar, Morabandar and Rajbandar, of which Rajbandar is the capital. Caves and stalls can be seen in Shentbandar. Morabandar has a thick forest. Staying overnight is not permitted for tourists. The first return ferry leaves at 12:30pm and the last at 6:30pm.\n\n"}
{"id": "1991036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991036", "title": "Pierre Desproges", "text": "Pierre Desproges\n\nPierre Desproges (May 9, 1939 – April 18, 1988) was a French humorist. He was born in Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis. According to himself, he made no significant achievements before the age of 30. From 1967 to 1970, he worked as: life insurance salesman, opinion pool investigator, \"lonely hearts\" columnist, horse racing forecaster, and sales manager for a styrofoam beam company.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1976, he worked for the newspaper \"L'Aurore\". Starting in 1975, he became a \"reporter\" on \"Le petit rapporteur\" (The Little Snitch), a satirical TV show hosted by Jacques Martin. He caught the public's attention with unconventional interviews of celebrities, among them novelists Françoise Sagan or Jean-Edern Hallier.\n\nHe appeared for the first time on stage at the Olympia theater during a Thierry Le Luron show. Among other things, he became very famous for his \"Chroniques de la haine ordinaire\" (Chronicles of Ordinary Hatred), a 1986 radio show.\n\nIn the 1980s, he appeared daily on \"Le tribunal des flagrants délires\" (a pun on the French term \"flagrant délit\" meaning red-handed), a comedy show where celebrities were judged in mock-trials. Desproges held the part of the prosecutor for more than two years, a part for which his verve, his scathing humour and his literary erudition were ideally suited.\n\nIn 1982, he created \"La minute nécessaire de Monsieur Cyclopède\", a series of shorts for TV, where he played an omniscient professor. He answered to metaphysical and nonsensical questions such as \"How to make King Louis XVI fireproof?\", proved that Beethoven was not deaf but stupid, and explained why the improbable encounter between the Venus de Milo and Saint Exupéry's 'Petit Prince' was a fiasco. Each episode ended with the catchphrase: \"\"Étonnant, non ?\"\" (\"Astonishing, isn't it?\")\n\nIn 1984, he had his first stand-up show at the Théâtre Fontaine. In 1986, his second stand-up, \"Pierre Desproges se donne en spectacle\" was presented at the Théâtre Grévin. He started work on a third stand-up, and the drafts were ultimately published in 2010.\n\nIn 1987, doctors discovered he had inoperable lung cancer in an advanced stage, and his relatives, in agreement with the doctors, decided to hide the condition from him, so he could spend his final days quietly. He died in 1988, from a disease he had bitterly laughed at time and time again, often saying \"I won't have cancer: I'm against it\". He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His epitaph reads: \"\"Pierre Desproges est mort d'un cancer, étonnant, non ?\"\" (\"Pierre Desproges died of cancer, astonishing, isn't it?\")\n\nPierre Desproges is the author of many memorable quotes, in particular \"you can laugh about everything, but not with everyone\". Although Pierre Desproges never actually wrote it in his texts, he did confirm that \"I do think that we can laugh at everything, but not necessarily with everyone.\".\n\nThe quote comes initially from an \"indictment\" that Desproges pronounced as \"Prosecutor of the French Republic\" against far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen on 28 September 1982 at Tribunal des flagrants délires on France Inter radio. In the first part of his speech, Desproges declares: \"Two questions haunt me. First, can we laugh at everything? Secondly, can we laugh with anyone?\". His answer to the first question is \"yes, undoubtly\". He adds that not only we \"can\" laugh at everything but that we \"must\" laugh at everything to \"desacralize our stupidity, exorcise our true sorrows and beat our mortal anxieties\". To the second question, he answers \"it's difficult\", in the sense that he, Pierre Desproges, does not want to laugh with anyone, especially the guest of that day, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Pierre Desproges later adds that laughing with \"a practicing Stalinist\", a \"hysterical terrorist\" or \"far-right activist\" is beyond his abilities.\n\nThe French magazine Télérama published an interview of Pierre Desproges on 24th November 1982, two months after the broadcast, where Pierre Desproges explains: “I think we have the right to laugh at everything. But to laugh with anyone, maybe not. (...) Laughter is an outlet and I do not understand why we should not laugh at what hurts. Things hurt less when we laugh”.\n\nDesproges reformulates his ideas the following year, in November 1983, in his book \"Vivons heureux en attentant la mort\" (Let us live happy while we wait to die): “It's better to laugh at Auschwitz with a Jew than to play Scrabble with Klaus Barbie”.Bernard Pivot invites Pierre Desproges to Apostrophes, a French TV literary talk show on 30th December 1983, to promote his book. Pierre Desproges says “we can laugh at absolutely everything but not with anyone”, and declares that when he prepared the speech about Jean-Marie Le Pen, he “did not want to laugh with him”.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1893, the School of Medicine shares a campus with the Johns Hopkins Hospital, established in 1889. Johns Hopkins has consistently ranked among the top medical schools in the United States, in terms of the number of competitive research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health, among other measures.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is located off Broadway in the East Baltimore campus of the Johns Hopkins University together with the Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Nursing. Known collectively as the \"Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions\" (JHMI) Campus, it spans several city blocks, radiating outwards from the 1889 original landmark red brick Billings building of the Johns Hopkins Hospital with its historic dome (cupola).\n\nThe founding physicians (the \"Four Doctors\") of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine included pathologist William Henry Welch (1850–1934), the first dean of the school and a mentor to generations of research scientists; a Canadian, internist Sir William Osler (1849–1919), regarded as the \"Father of Modern Medicine\", having been perhaps the most influential physician of the late 19th and early 20th centuries as author of \"The Principles and Practice of Medicine\" (1892), written at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and published for more than a century; surgeon William Stewart Halsted (1852–1922), who revolutionized surgery by insisting on subtle skill and technique, as well as strict adherence to sanitary procedures; and gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly (1858–1943), a superb gynecological surgeon credited with establishing gynecology as a specialty and being among the first to use radium to treat cancer.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, which was finally begun 17 years after its original visionary benefactor Johns Hopkins (1795–1873), died and opened only with the large financial help offered by several wealthy daughters of the city's business elite on condition that the medical school be open equally to students of both sexes, consequently one of the first co-educational medical colleges.\n\nThe School of Medicine is affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Hospital, its main teaching hospital, as well as several other regional medical centers, including the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center on Eastern Avenue in East Baltimore; the Howard County General Hospital, near Ellicott City, southwest of Baltimore; Suburban Hospital in Bethesda in suburban Montgomery County, (northwest of Washington, D.C.); Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.; and Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida. Together, they form an academic health science center.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is the home of many medical advancements and contributions, including the first of many to admit women and to introduce rubber gloves, which provided a sterile approach to conducting surgical procedures. Johns Hopkins has also published \"The Harriet Lane Handbook\", an indispensable tool for pediatricians, for over 60 years. The Lieber Institute for Brain Development is an affiliate of the School.\n\nFor years, Johns Hopkins has been among the nation's top medical schools in the number of competitive research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health. According to \"U.S. News and World Report\", Johns Hopkins ranks #2 among research-oriented medical schools and has always ranked in the top 3. Its major teaching hospital, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, was ranked the top hospital in the United States every year from 1991 to 2011 by \"U.S. News & World Report\". \"International Business Times\" named an MD from Johns Hopkins one of the five most prestigious degrees in the world. Some achievements attributed to the school include the development of CPR, the discovery of the first effective treatments for severe forms of sickle cell disease, the development of the first biological pacemaker for the heart, and the planning and performance of one of the most challenging double arm transplants to date.\n\nAccording to the \"Flexner Report\", Hopkins has served as the model for American medical education. It was the first medical school to require its students to have an undergraduate degree and was also the first graduate-level medical school to admit women on an equal basis as men. Mary Elizabeth Garrett, head of the Women's Medical School Fund, was a driving force behind both of these \"firsts\". Sir William Osler became the first Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins and the first Physician-in-Chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Osler was responsible for establishing the \"residency\" system of postgraduate medical training, where young physicians were required to \"reside\" within the hospital to better care for their patients.\n\nUpon matriculation, medical students at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine are divided into four Colleges named after famous Hopkins faculty members who have had an impact in the history of medicine (Florence Sabin, Vivien Thomas, Daniel Nathans and Helen Taussig). The Colleges were established to \"foster camaraderie, networking, advising, mentoring, professionalism, clinical skills, and scholarship\" in 2005. In each incoming class, 30 students are assigned to each College, and each College is further subdivided into six \"molecules\" of five students each. Each molecule is advised and taught by a faculty advisor, who instructs them in \"Clinical Foundations of Medicine\", a core first-year course, and continue advising them throughout their 4 years of medical school. The family within each college of each molecule across the four years who belong to a given advisor is referred to as a \"macromolecule.\" Every year, the Colleges compete in the “College Olympics” in late October, a competition that includes athletic events and sports as well as art battles and dance-offs. Sabin College is the defending Olympics champion from both 2017 and 2018. Taussig College has held the Spirit Award each consecutive Olympics since 2016.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine is led by Ronald J. Daniels, the president of the Johns Hopkins University, Paul B. Rothman, CEO and dean of the medical faculty, and Ronald R. Peterson, president of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and health system. The CFO of Johns Hopkins Medicine is Richard A. Grossi, who is also the Senior Associate Dean for Finance and Administration and executive vice president of Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nVice deans preside over specific administrative task areas. The vice deans are: William A Baumgartner, Vice Dean for Clinical Affairs; Janice E. Clements, Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs; Landon King, Vice Dean for Research; Daniel E. Ford, Vice Dean for Clinical Investigation; David G. Nichols, Vice Dean for Education; and David Hellmann, Vice Dean for the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The dean's office also includes over twenty administrators in the position of associate or assistant dean.\n\n18 Nobel laureates associated with the School of Medicine as alumni and faculty have won the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Chemistry. Johns Hopkins University as a whole counts 38 Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is filmed in and around the Franconian city of Würzburg and in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\nKai and Stefan are two friends who own a gourmet pizza delivery business as a front for selling cannabis. Stefan is finishing law school and preparing to take the Bar examination to become a lawyer under the behest of his father, who is a judge. They visit their outdoor cannabis growing operation only to discover that aphids are destroying their plants. They visit a head shop and meet Achim, who informs them that he knows how to get rid of aphids, handing them a tub full of \"Aphidoletes aphidimyza\". However, unbeknownst to the protagonists, Achim is an undercover police officer.\n\nAfter much debate, the duo decide to bring Achim to the plantation so that he can help with the aphid problem, using an adulterant on the plants called \"Brain cell massacre,\" which, according to Achim, is used in Kazakhstan plantations. On the way to the growing area, they try to pick psychedelic mushrooms, convinced that nobody will be suspicious of mushrooms on a pizza. They test them out on Achim while he is at the plantation, stating that they already tried some. Achim is poisoned by the mushrooms and goes into a convulsive state, when suddenly a hunter is spotted nearby. The \"Brain cell massacre\" is used to knock Achim out, and he is locked in the protagonists' trunk, along with the hunter who discovered the cannabis plantation as well as the harvested crop itself.\n\nAfter narrowly avoiding an unrelated police search, the duo confront Stefan's father and confess their situation. Though Stefan's father becomes upset, he calls the chief of police, whom he befriended when he was a public prosecutor. With the help of the chief of police, the duo get off the hook, and Stefan takes his bar exam only to walk out at the last minute to pursue his lifelong dream of owning a cafe on a beach.\n\n\nAfter asking followers of his Facebook page whether they want to see a sequel of the 2001 film and receiving great approval, Bleibtreu announced the film \"Lommbock\" in November 2015, scheduled for release on March 23, 2017.

The village is not inhabited year-round.\n\nEven though trekking lodges at Gorak Shep are basic, in recent times more modern amenities have become available, such as satellite high-speed internet access.\n\nGorak Shep is inside the Sagarmatha National Park, the homeland of the Sherpa people, famous for their skills as guides and mountaineers. It is the final stop on most common treks to Everest Base Camp from Lukla, following what the Dalai Lama dubbed \"the steps to heaven.\"\n\nThis route takes trekkers from Lukla to Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, Pangboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and on to Gorak Shep. Most trekkers stay overnight there, as their trekking permits will not allow them to camp at Everest Base Camp. \n\nAlso, Gorak Shep provides the best \"launching pad\" for an ascent of Kala Patthar, which looks like a giant dune looming over the lakebed.

{"id": "1991073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991073", "title": "Surface plasmon resonance", "text": "Surface plasmon resonance\n\nSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons at the interface between negative and positive permittivity material stimulated by incident light. SPR is the basis of many standard tools for measuring adsorption of material onto planar metal (typically gold or silver) surfaces or onto the surface of metal nanoparticles. It is the fundamental principle behind many color-based biosensor applications, different lab-on-a-chip sensors and diatom photosynthesis.\n\nThe surface plasmon polariton is a non-radiative electromagnetic surface wave that propagates in a direction parallel to the negative permittivity/dielectric material interface. Since the wave is on the boundary of the conductor and the external medium (air, water or vacuum for example), these oscillations are very sensitive to any change of this boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules to the conducting surface.\n\nTo describe the existence and properties of surface plasmon polaritons, one can choose from various models (quantum theory, Drude model, etc.). The simplest way to approach the problem is to treat each material as a homogeneous continuum, described by a frequency-dependent relative permittivity between the external medium and the surface. This quantity, hereafter referred to as the materials' \"dielectric function\", is the complex permittivity. In order for the terms that describe the electronic surface plasmon to exist, the real part of the dielectric constant of the conductor must be negative and its magnitude must be greater than that of the dielectric. This condition is met in the infrared-visible wavelength region for air/metal and water/metal interfaces (where the real dielectric constant of a metal is negative and that of air or water is positive).\n\nLSPRs (localized surface plasmon resonances) are collective electron charge oscillations in metallic nanoparticles that are excited by light. They exhibit enhanced near-field amplitude at the resonance wavelength. This field is highly localized at the nanoparticle and decays rapidly away from the nanoparticle/dieletric interface into the dielectric background, though far-field scattering by the particle is also enhanced by the resonance. Light intensity enhancement is a very important aspect of LSPRs and localization means the LSPR has very high spatial resolution (subwavelength), limited only by the size of nanoparticles. Because of the enhanced field amplitude, effects that depend on the amplitude such as magneto-optical effect are also enhanced by LSPRs.\n\nIn order to excite surface plasmon polaritons in a resonant manner, one can use electron bombardment or incident light beam (visible and infrared are typical). The incoming beam has to match its momentum to that of the plasmon. In the case of p-polarized light (polarization occurs parallel to the plane of incidence), this is possible by passing the light through a block of glass to increase the wavenumber (and the momentum), and achieve the resonance at a given wavelength and angle. S-polarized light (polarization occurs perpendicular to the plane of incidence) cannot excite electronic surface plasmons.\nElectronic and magnetic surface plasmons obey the following dispersion relation:\n\nwhere k(formula_2) is the wave vector, formula_3 is the relative permittivity, and formula_4 is the relative permeability of the material (1: the glass block, 2: the metal film), while formula_2 is angular frequency and formula_6 is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nTypical metals that support surface plasmons are silver and gold, but metals such as copper, titanium or chromium have also been used.\n\nWhen using light to excite SP waves, there are two configurations which are well known. In the Otto configuration, the light illuminates the wall of a glass block, typically a prism, and is totally internally reflected. A thin metal film (for example gold) is positioned close enough to the prism wall so that an evanescent wave can interact with the plasma waves on the surface and hence excite the plasmons.\n\nIn the Kretschmann configuration (also known as Kretschmann-Raether configuration), the metal film is evaporated onto the glass block. The light again illuminates the glass block, and an evanescent wave penetrates through the metal film. The plasmons are excited at the outer side of the film. This configuration is used in most practical applications.\n\nWhen the surface plasmon wave interacts with a local particle or irregularity, such as a rough surface, part of the energy can be re-emitted as light. This emitted light can be detected \"behind\" the metal film from various directions.\n\nSurface plasmons have been used to enhance the surface sensitivity of several spectroscopic measurements including fluorescence, Raman scattering, and second-harmonic generation. However, in their simplest form, SPR reflectivity measurements can be used to detect molecular adsorption, such as polymers, DNA or proteins, etc. Technically, it is common to measure the angle of minimum reflection (angle of maximum absorption). This angle changes in the order of 0.1° during thin (about nm thickness) film adsorption. (See also the Examples.) In other cases the changes in the absorption wavelength is followed. The mechanism of detection is based on that the adsorbing molecules cause changes in the local index of refraction, changing the resonance conditions of the surface plasmon waves. The same principle is exploited in the recently developed competitive platform based on loss-less dielectric multilayers (DBR), supporting surface electromagnetic waves with sharper resonances (Bloch surface waves).\n\nIf the surface is patterned with different biopolymers, using adequate optics and imaging sensors (i.e. a camera), the technique can be extended to surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI). This method provides a high contrast of the images based on the adsorbed amount of molecules, somewhat similar to Brewster angle microscopy (this latter is most commonly used together with a Langmuir–Blodgett trough).\n\nFor nanoparticles, localized surface plasmon oscillations can give rise to the intense colors of suspensions or sols containing the nanoparticles. Nanoparticles or nanowires of noble metals exhibit strong absorption bands in the ultraviolet–visible light regime that are not present in the bulk metal. This extraordinary absorption increase has been exploited to increase light absorption in photovoltaic cells by depositing metal nanoparticles on the cell surface. The energy (color) of this absorption differs when the light is polarized along or perpendicular to the nanowire. Shifts in this resonance due to changes in the local index of refraction upon adsorption to the nanoparticles can also be used to detect biopolymers such as DNA or proteins. \nRelated complementary techniques include plasmon waveguide resonance, QCM, extraordinary optical transmission, and dual-polarization interferometry.\n\nThe first SPR immunoassay was proposed in 1983 by Liedberg, Nylander, and Lundström, then of the Linköping Institute of Technology (Sweden). They adsorbed\nhuman IgG onto a 600-angstrom silver film, and used the assay to detect anti-human IgG in water solution. Unlike many other immunoassays, such as ELISA, an SPR immunoassay is \"label free\" in that a label molecule is not required for detection of the analyte. Additionally, the measurements on SPR can be followed real-time allowing the monitoring of individual steps in sequential binding events particularly useful in the assessment of for instance sandwich complexes.\n\nMulti-parametric surface plasmon resonance, a special configuration of SPR, can be used to characterize layers and stacks of layers. Besides binding kinetics, MP-SPR can also provide information on structural changes in terms of layer true thickness and refractive index. MP-SPR has been applied successfully in measurements of lipid targeting and rupture, CVD-deposited single monolayer of graphene (3.7Å) as well as micrometer thick polymers.\n\nThe most common data interpretation is based on the Fresnel formulas, which treat the formed thin films as infinite, continuous dielectric layers. This interpretation may result in multiple possible refractive index and thickness values. However, usually only one solution is within the reasonable data range. In multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance, two SPR curves are acquired by scanning a range of angles at two different wavelengths, which results in a unique solution for both thickness and refractive index.\n\nMetal particle plasmons are usually modeled using the Mie scattering theory.\n\nIn many cases no detailed models are applied, but the sensors are calibrated for the specific application, and used with interpolation within the calibration curve.\n\nOne of the first common applications of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was the measurement of the thickness (and refractive index) of adsorbed self-assembled nanofilms on gold substrates. The resonance curves shift to higher angles as the thickness of the adsorbed film increases. This example is a 'static SPR' measurement.\n\nWhen higher speed observation is desired, one can select an angle right below\nthe resonance point (the angle of minimum reflectance), and measure the reflectivity changes at that point.\nThis is the so-called 'dynamic SPR' measurement. The interpretation of the data assumes that the structure of the film does not change significantly during the measurement.\n\nWhen the affinity of two ligands has to be determined, the equilibrium dissociation constant must be determined. It is the equilibrium value for the product quotient. This value can also be found using the dynamic SPR parameters and, as in any chemical reaction, it is the dissociation rate divided by the association rate.\n\nFor this, a bait ligand is immobilized on the dextran surface of the SPR crystal. Through a microflow system, a solution with the prey analyte is injected over the bait layer. As the prey analyte binds the bait ligand, an increase in SPR signal (expressed in response units, RU) is observed. After desired association time, a solution without the prey analyte (usually the buffer) is injected on the microfluidics that dissociates the bound complex between bait ligand and prey analyte. Now as the prey analyte dissociates from the bait ligand, a decrease in SPR signal (expressed in resonance units, RU) is observed. From these association ('on rate', ) and dissociation rates ('off rate', ), the equilibrium dissociation constant ('binding constant', ) can be calculated.\n\nThe actual SPR signal can be explained by the electromagnetic 'coupling' of the incident light with the surface plasmon of the gold layer. This plasmon can be influenced by the layer just a few nanometer across the gold–solution interface i.e. the bait protein and possibly the prey protein. Binding makes the reflection angle change;\n\nformula_7\n\nAs SPR biosensors facilitate measurements at different temperatures, thermodynamic analysis can be performed\nto obtain a better understanding of the studied interaction. By performing measurements at different temperatures,\ntypically between 4 and 40 °C, it is possible to relate association and dissociation rate constants with activation\nenergy and thereby obtain thermodynamic parameters including binding enthalpy, binding entropy,\nGibbs free energy and heat capacity.\n\nAs SPR allows real-time monitoring, individual steps in sequential binding events can be thoroughly assessed when investigating the suitability between antibodies in a sandwich configuration. Additionally, it allows the mapping of epitopes as antibodies of overlapping epitopes will be associated with an attenuated signal compared to those capable of interacting simultaneously.\n\nRecently, there has been an interest in magnetic surface plasmons. These require materials with large negative magnetic permeability, a property that has only recently been made available with the construction of metamaterials.\n\n\n"}

It was the recipient of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play premiered on Broadway in 2006, and it has also been produced by regional theatres in cities such as Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The play had its Spanish language premiere in San Juan, Puerto Rico in Autumn of 2010.\n\nThe play deals with the ways family members survive a major loss, and includes comedy as well as tragedy. Cynthia Nixon won the 2006 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for her performance as Becca in the New York production, and the play was nominated for several other Tony awards.\n\nBecca—Howie's wife in her late 30s. She is usually a very responsible and sensible person but makes some rash decisions throughout the play because of grief. Howie accuses her of subconsciously trying to \"erase\" Danny by selling the house, packing up his artwork, and getting rid of their dog, even erasing the most recent home video of Danny.<br>\n\nIzzy—Becca's irresponsible but well-wishing sister. She is unwed but in a relationship with Auggie. She is pregnant throughout the play. Tension is created as Becca's mourning for her lost child lingers, and she is suspicious of Izzy's ability to raise her own.\n\nHowie—Becca's husband in his late 30s. He is very caring but has a hard time dealing with Danny's death, which causes him to be angry and depressed, though he hides it as much as possible. He obsessively watches home movies of Danny and thinks that the best way to move on is to try for another child. He attends group grief counseling meetings. It is implied that he has an affair with a woman from this group. He does not want to meet with Jason, whom he blames for Danny's death.<br>\n\nNat—Izzy and Becca's mother. She is the voice of reason for her daughters. She helps Howie and Becca in the moving process and provides motherly experience to Becca. Her son (Becca's brother, Arthur), a heroin addict, hanged himself at the age of 30. Becca, however, does not want to hear this, as she feels that the deaths are not comparable. She eventually realizes that her mother has gone through this as well, and accepts the comfort.<br>\n\nJason Willette—17-year-old boy who accidentally hit Danny with his car, leading to Danny's death. He lives with his mom; his father's whereabouts are never revealed, but the script suggests he's dead. He enjoys science fiction and writes a story about wormholes to other dimensions in Danny's memory, which he publishes in the school's literary magazine. He sends this story to Becca and Howie. He later shows up at the open house, wanting to talk to Howie and Becca. Howie chases him away, but he later meets with Becca. He blames himself for Danny's death.\n\nDanny—Killed at age 4. Son of Becca and Howie. Heard on a video Howie watches at night. He is on a beach in the video.<br>\n\nTaz—Dog that Danny followed into the street. He is never seen in the play but is heard barking on multiple occasions. Becca doesn't want him (because he reminds her of Danny), but Howie loves him.<br>\n\nRick and Debbie—friends of Becca and Howie who have a daughter, Emily, Danny's age. Debbie avoids Becca after the accident, but Rick and Howie still play squash together.<br>\n\nReema—Izzy's friend, a waitress at Calderone's. She sees Howie there with a woman, who is revealed to be a woman from his grief counseling.<br>\n\nAuggie—Izzy's boyfriend and the baby's father. He had a girlfriend when he began a relationship with Izzy.\n\n\"Rabbit Hole\" premiered on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre in a Manhattan Theatre Club production on January 12, 2006 in previews, officially on February 2, 2006 and closed on April 9, 2006 after 77 performances. Directed by Daniel Sullivan, the cast featured Cynthia Nixon (Becca), John Slattery (Howie), Tyne Daly (Nat), John Gallagher, Jr. (Jason) and Mary Catherine Garrison (Izzy).\n\nWhile John Gallagher, Jr. was in this show, he was in rehearsals for \"Spring Awakening\".\n\nThe play was originally commissioned by South Coast Repertory, Costa Mesa, California, and first presented at its Pacific Playwrights Festival reading series in 2005.\n\nThe play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for 2007. The play received five 2006 Tony Award nominations: for Best Play, Best Direction of a Play, Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play (Tyne Daly) and Best Scenic Design of a Play (John Lee Beatty). Cynthia Nixon won the 2006 Tony Award, Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.\n\nThe Spanish version \"Los universos paralelos\" premiered at the Teatro Palacio Valdés de Avilés on 17 March 2017. The production moved to the Teatro Español in Madrid from 20 de September to 15 de October 2017. It starred Malena Alterio, Daniel Grao, Carmen Balagué, Belén Cuesta and Itzan Escamilla and was directed by David Serrano. In 2018 the company toured around Spain visiting cities such as Vigo, Burgos, Gijón, Roquetas de Mar, San Sebastián, Ponferrada, León, Aranda de Duero among several others.\n\nThe movie adaptation, directed by John Cameron Mitchell, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2010, and received a limited theatrical release in December 2010.

Its editor-in-chief since inception has been Andrew Gallix, a lecturer at the Sorbonne.\n\n\"3:AM\" features literary criticism, nonfiction essays, original fiction, poetry, and interviews with leading writers and philosophers. Its slogan is \"Whatever it is, we're against it.\"\n\nThe magazine was launched in 2000. In 2004, the editors unsuccessfully tried to prevent the \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper from publishing a short-lived \"3am Magazine\" supplement based around its 3am Girls gossip column. The site was called \"irreverently highbrow\" by Heather Stewart in \"The Observer\", and described as aiming to be \"an online Fitzrovia\" by Lilian Pizzichini in \"The Daily Telegraph.\" Boyd Tonkin, in \"The Independent,\" described it as keeping \"faith with the old little-review tradition of \"avant-garde\" provocation and seditious literary cheek\" and Inés Martin Rodrigo, in Spanish daily \"ABC,\" likened it to an \"Offbeats' \"New Yorker\"\".\n\nAn anthology covering its first five years of publishing, \"The Edgier Waters\", was published in Britain by Snowbooks in June 2006, featuring writers Steve Almond, Bruce Benderson, Michael Bracewell, Tom Bradley, Billy Childish, Steven Hall, Ben Myers, Tim Parks, Mark Simpson, HP Tinker and Kenji Siratori, as well as poetry pieces arranged by Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo alongside Tyondai Braxton.\n\nA volume of city-themed fiction, \"3:AM London, Paris, New York\" followed in 2008 and featured Henry Baum, Chris Cleave, Niven Govinden, Laura Hird, Toby Litt, Lee Rourke, Nicholas Royle, Matt Thorne and Evie Wyld.\n\nIn July 2012 the site was temporarily offline due to an issue with its server provider.\n\nIn 2014, a book-length collection of 3:AM's popular 'End Times' interviews of notable philosophers (as conducted by RIchard Marshall) was published by Oxford University Press with a further volume following in 2017.\n\n\"3:AM\" was listed as being among the top 25 websites for literature lovers by Jason Diamond in \"Flavorwire\" in 2013. and as being among Mark Thwaite's 5 favorite literary blogs in \"The Guardian\" in 2014.\n\n\"3:AM\" sees itself as an extension of publishing traditions forged by earlier literary magazines before the advent of webzines. It has claimed its litblog 'Buzzwords' to be the world's first (since 2000). The magazine features literary criticism, fiction, poetry, and interviews with writers, philosophers and intellectuals.\n\nIn its early period, \"3:AM\" focused particularly on cult and transgressive fiction, for instance Attack! Books, Stewart Home, Tom Bradley and Chris Kelso. Its outlook and coverage was for some years post-punk, particularly the emphasis on Blank Generation authors and elements of Prada-Meinhof (for instance Stuart Christie and John Barker). Both Stuckism and the Medway Poets featured prominently, from Billy Childish, Wolf Howard and Sexton Ming to a column by mainstay Charles Thomson, though to a lesser extent 3:AM also carried pieces supportive of Britart, in particular on Damien Hirst and with Matthew Collings. There was a further strong musical presence on the site, from an extensive archive by and about punk rockers (including several interviews with members of the Bromley Contingent), through to pieces by and about Spacemen 3 and other shoegazer acts.\n\nAuthors interviewed several times include Steve Almond, Will Ashon, Stephen Barber, Childish, Andrei Codrescu, Dennis Cooper, Richard Hell, Stewart Home, Tom Bradley, Wu Ming, Michael Moorcock, Dan Rhodes, Nicholas Royle, Iain Sinclair, Scarlett Thomas, Cathi Unsworth, John King, Helen Walsh, Jon Savage, and Simon Critchley. The magazine also interviewed figures in the underground press, such as Lisa Crystal Carver, Lydia Lunch, Mick Farren and Pleasant Gehman. It has carried poetry by Charles Bukowski and featured interviews by Bukowski acolyte Ben Pleasants, including with John Fante and Steve Richmond. Former Kenickie and Brian Jonestown Massacre keyboardist turned novelist Tony O'Neill was a regular contributor and interviewee.\n\nPast columnists have included Sophie Parkin, Ben Myers, Hillary Raphael, and Cathi Unsworth, while past editors have included Noah Cicero, Heidi James, Travis Jeppesen, Tao Lin (Poetry Editor), Adelle Stripe, HP Tinker and Guy Mankowski.\n\nTom McCarthy (whom it championed from the outset of his writing career) has written several pieces for 3:AM and appeared at a number of its events. 3:AM Editor Andrew Gallix runs the unofficial Tom McCarthy site 'Surplus Matter' It has reviewed, interviewed and run excerpts of avant-garde writers Lydia Lunch, Stephen Barber and Stewart Home.\n\nLater \"3:AM\" became eminent in the translation of European avant-garde poetry under its \"Maintenant\" series. Its \"3:AM\" Asia strand has also covered transgressive culture and artists, particularly from Japan. The 'End Times' series of interviews with leading philosophers became a crucial part of \"3:AM\"'s identity, which resulted in collected interviews being published by Oxford University Press. Recently, 3:AM has also shown an increased engagement with avant-garde fiction and with essayistic, philosophically-inflected forms of literary criticism. In 2014 it partnered with the British Film Institute for their Derek Jarman season on the 20th anniversary of his death. In 2016 it reintroduced its earlier music strand of essayistic journalism and interviews.\n\nAs of April 2020, the co-editor in chief of \"3:AM\" is Andrew Gallix with Joseph Schrieber (non-fiction editor), Mark de Silva (fiction editor), SJ Fowler (poetry editor), Lee Rourke, Isabella Streffen, and Sylvia Warren (contributing editors).\n\n\n"}

FSI provides more than 800 courses—including over 70 foreign languages—to more than 170,000 enrollees a year from the Department of State and more than 50 other government agencies and the military service branches. FSI is based at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe Institute's programs include training for the development of United States Foreign Service and Civil Service professionals, and for Foreign Service Nationals who work at U.S. posts around the world. Ranging in length from one day to two years, courses are designed to promote successful performance in each professional assignment, to ease the adjustment to other countries and cultures, and to enhance the leadership and management capabilities of the U.S. foreign affairs community. Other courses and services help family members prepare for the demands of a mobile lifestyle and living abroad, and provide employees and their families with important information about such critical and timely topics as emergency preparedness and cyber-security awareness, among others.\n\nAccording to the Foreign Service Institute’s website, the Foreign Service Institute is the U.S. government’s “premier foreign affairs training provider...dedicated to ensuring the career-long learning opportunities required for success in today’s global arena. FSI promotes substantive, regional, and linguistic expertise, leadership finesse, personal resilience and innovative problem-solving. FSI serves the U.S. Department of State and the entire U.S. government foreign affairs community as a strategic enabler of diplomatic excellence.”\n\nThe Director of the Foreign Service Institute is equivalent in rank to an Assistant Secretary of State, and is appointed by the Secretary of State. The FSI Director is the Chief Learning Officer responsible for professional training for the U.S. Department of State and federal foreign affairs agencies.\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute was first proposed as an in-service, graduate-level training institute for State Department employees and others in the Foreign Service. A number of different training schools and programs preceded the Foreign Service Institute, including the Consular School of Application (1907), the Wilson Diplomatic School (1909), the Foreign Service School (1924), the Foreign Service Officers' Training School (1931) and the Division of Training Services (1945).\n\nIn 1946, President Truman signed legislation that enabled Secretary of State George C. Marshall to establish the Institute on March 13, 1947. The Foreign Service Institute was initially authorized in Title VII of the Foreign Service Act. The issuance of Departmental orders fulfilling this section of the Act were delayed by the need to first resolve certain administrative issues. The orders were ultimately issued and, on March 13, 1947, Secretary of State George Marshall announced the establishment of the Foreign Service Institute.\n\nIn 1947, the Foreign Service Institute opened in the Mayfair Building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. at 2115 C Street NW, a building that was subsequently razed for the new State Department headquarters. The institute included four schools: Basic Officer Training, Advanced Officer Training, Management and Administrative Training, and Language Training. FSI then moved to leased space in Rosslyn, Virginia until October 1993, when it relocated to its current home. In 1954, the Wriston Report criticized the resources and support being devoted to FSI, and in the following year, FSI overhauled its curriculum, adding longer specialized training, putting a greater emphasis on language training, and opening up courses to wives of Foreign Service Officers.\n\nIn October 1993, FSI moved to the National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia, and remains headquartered there today.\n\nIn 2017, FSI celebrated the 70th anniversary of its founding, with the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training releasing an e-book in honor of its anniversary.\n\nThe Foreign Service Institute currently has four schools: Leadership and Management, Language Studies, Professional and Area Studies, and Applied Information Technology, along with the Transition Center and an executive office for administrative functions.\n\nThe School of Language Studies (SLS) offers instruction in more than 70 languages and proficiency testing in over 100 languages. Enrollments may be 8–44 weeks, depending on the difficulty of the language and the individual's proficiency objectives. The Foreign Service Institute's School of Language Studies also maintains a network of language field schools in Taipei, Yokohama, Seoul, and other regional programs in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia where a further 44 weeks of instruction is offered overseas in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic. Programs and courses of study also include self-study, early morning classes and distance learning courses. FSI is a co-creator of the speaking and reading language proficiency rating scales used throughout the U.S. government. SLS is active within the U.S. government’s interagency community of language trainers and testers and frequently benchmarks with external foreign affairs agencies on language instruction.\n\nThe School of Professional and Area Studies (SPAS) offers training in foreign affairs specialties, such as consular, management tradecraft, political and economic affairs, public diplomacy, curriculum and staff development, office management, and orientation programs. It also offers guidance on the socio-cultural patterns, politics, economics, and international relations of world regions and individual countries. SPAS provides tailored programs in Consular, Economic and Commercial, Management, Office Management, Political, and Public Diplomacy, as well as new-hire orientation programs and in-depth Area Studies courses. SPAS is also home to the Center for the Study of the Conduct of Diplomacy (CSCD), which examines recent diplomatic experiences in order to capture best practices and lessons learned. CSCD produces comparative analyses which are incorporated into FSI training and used to help prepare foreign affairs professionals at all ranks for the challenges faced at U.S. missions around the world.\n\nThe School of Applied Information Technology (SAIT) is divided into four broad generalities: training to improve the business application skills of all employees, training in the technologies employed across the Department of State for IT professionals, IRM tradecraft courses that provide IT managers with broad IT management skills, and training for new Information Management Specialists and Information Management Technical Specialists to prepare them for initial and continued overseas employment with the Department.\n\nThe Leadership and Management School (LMS) offers mandatory and elective leadership and management training for supervisors and managers from entry to executive levels; roundtables and policy seminars for senior leaders; and crisis management training overseas and at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center.\n\nThe Transition Center (TC) prepares employees and their family members for effectiveness in the foreign affairs community throughout, and after, their careers. The Transition Center provides:\ninsights and information on all domestic and overseas posts;\nworkshops and courses on Foreign Service life skills and security training; and\ntraining, counseling, and other assistance for Department of State and foreign affairs employees from other agencies leaving U.S. Government service. TC’s Center of Excellence in Foreign Affairs Resilience (CEFAR) provides consultations and training designed to help individuals, family members, and teams perform in high-stress and high-level-threat environments.\n\n\n"}

In bases 7 and above, there is, if nothing else, a self-descriptive number of the form formula_1, which has \"b\"−4 instances of the digit 0, two instances of the digit 1, one instance of the digit 2, one instance of digit \"b\" – 4, and no instances of any other digits. The following table lists some self-descriptive numbers in a few selected bases:\n\nFrom the numbers listed in the table, it would seem that all self-descriptive numbers have digit sums equal to their base, and that they're multiples of that base. The first fact follows trivially from the fact that the digit sum equals the total number of digits, which is equal to the base, from the definition of self-descriptive number.\n\nThat a self-descriptive number in base \"b\" must be a multiple of that base (or equivalently, that the last digit of the self-descriptive number must be 0) can be proven by contradiction as follows: assume that there is in fact a self-descriptive number \"m\" in base \"b\" that is \"b\"-digits long but not a multiple of \"b\". The digit at position \"b\" – 1 must be at least 1, meaning that there is at least one instance of the digit \"b\" – 1 in \"m\". At whatever position \"x\" that digit \"b\" – 1 falls, there must be at least \"b\" – 1 instances of digit \"x\" in \"m\". Therefore, we have at least one instance of the digit 1, and \"b\" – 1 instances of \"x\". If \"x\" > 1, then \"m\" has more than \"b\" digits, leading to a contradiction of our initial statement. And if \"x\" = 0 or 1, that also leads to a contradiction.\n\nIt follows that a self-descriptive number in base \"b\" is a Harshad number in base \"b\".\n\nA generalization of the self-descriptive numbers, called the autobiographical numbers, allow fewer digits than the base, as long as the digits that are included in the number suffice to completely describe it. e.g. in base 10, 3211000 has 3 zeros, 2 ones, 1 two, and 1 three. Note that this depends on being allowed to include as many trailing zeros as suit, without them adding any further information about the other present digits.\n\nBecause leading zeros are not written down, every autobiographical number contains at least one zero, so that its first digit is nonzero.\n\nTopically, 2020 is an autobiographical number.\n\nConsidering a hypothetical case where the digits are treated in the opposite order: the units is the count of zeros, the 10s the count of ones, and so on, there are no such self-describing numbers. Attempts to construct one result in an explosive requirement to add more and more digits.\n\n"}

It is south of Victory Park, west of the Arts, City Center, and Main Street districts, and north of the Government and Reunion districts. A portion of the district is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as Westend Historic District. A smaller area is also a Dallas Landmark District. The far western part of the district belongs to the Dealey Plaza Historic District, a National Historic Landmark around structures and memorials associated with the Assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe area that would become the West End originally consisted simply of a trading post, established by John Neely Bryan. In July 1872, the Houston & Texas Central Railroad arrived in downtown, attracting manufacturing companies whose warehouses would come to define the architecture of the West End.\n\nThe district reached nationwide prominence in the 1960s, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in a Presidential motorcade traveling through Dealey Plaza. While the assassination brought the attention to the West End, the district's economy still struggled, with many businesses leaving the city center for suburban locations.\n\nAs development changed downtown Dallas and older buildings were demolished, local developer Preston Carter Jr. began the revitalization of the West End in June 1976 in an effort to preserve its history. Old warehouses and other brick buildings were converted to restaurants and shops. In November 1978, the West End Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nToday, over seven million people visit the West End annually, making it one of the city's leading tourist attractions. In recent years the area has suffered a decline. The West End Marketplace, a massive mall/entertainment complex, closed its doors on June 30, 2006. Due to the recent development of Victory Park, the main marketplace was redeveloped into an apartment and business complex.\n\nDART , , , \n\nThe district is zoned to schools in the Dallas Independent School District.\n\nResidents of the district south of Pacific are zoned to City Park Elementary School, Billy Earl Dade Middle School, and James Madison High School.

It was first raised on 1 December 1961 prior to the territory coming under administration of the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) on 1 October 1962.\n\nThe flag is used by the Free Papua Organization and other independence supporters. Under Papua's \"Special Autonomy Law\", ratified in 2002, the flag may be raised in Papua so long as the flag of Indonesia is also raised and it is higher than the Morning Star flag. The flag consists of a red vertical band along the hoist side, with a white five-pointed star in the center, and thirteen horizontal stripes, alternating blue and white, with seven blue stripes and six white ones.\n\nAfter territorial elections in February 1961 the New Guinea Council a representative body consisting of 28 members were sworn into office by Governor Dr. P.J.Platteel on 1 April 1961 and the Council's inaugurations on 5 April 1961 were attended by Australia, Britain, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and other Pacific Forum nations with exception of the United States. The Council appointed a National Committee to draft a Manifesto expressing the desire for independence, and to design a flag and anthem commensurate with this desire. The design of the flag is credited to Nicolaas Jouwe. The full New Guinea Council endorsed these actions on 30 October 1961 and the first Morning Star flag was presented to Governor Platteel on 31 October 1961.\nThe Dutch authorities did not accept the denomination of the flag recognising it as a territorial flag (landsvlag) not a national flag.\n\nAn inauguration ceremony was held on 1 December 1961 with the flag officially raised for the first time outside the Council's building in the presence of the Governor together with the Dutch flag.\n\nOn 1 July 1971 at Markas Victoria in West Papua, Brigadier General Seth Jafeth Rumkorem, leader of the militant independence movement Free Papua Movement (), proclaimed unilaterally Papua Barat or West Papua as an independent democratic republic. The Morning Star flag was declared as a national flag.\n\nThe Morning Star is flown by independence movements and supporters across the world. Special ceremonies take place on 1 December of each year, to commemorate the first flag raising in 1961. The flying of the Morning Star is seen by Indonesian authorities as advocating independence challenging Indonesian sovereignty.\n\nTwo Papuan men, Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage, were sentenced to 15 and 10 year sentences for raising the flag in Jayapura in 2004. Pakage was released in 2010, having served five years of his term. Karma was released in November 2015 and has alleged abuse at the hands of prison authorities during his incarceration. Amnesty International considered both men prisoners of conscience and named Karma a 2011 \"priority case.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Katz was assigned management of the \"First Line,\" that part of the NKGB mission aimed at recruiting selected members of the Communist Party USA. He was an agent/group leader (gruppovik) and co-owner of a Soviet front company that manufactured gloves.\n\nThe Venona project suggests he may have been implicated, along with Amadeo Sabatini, in the murder of Walter Krivitsky in 1941. After the death of Jacob Golos in November 1943, spotting and recruitment was taken over by Katz by mid–1944, while Elizabeth Bentley continued as manager and courier. Katz was extremely active at this time. Katz was known to Elizabeth Bentley as \"Jack.\"\n\nIn 1944 Katz was put in charge of handling agent recruitments from the New York City TASS office headed by Vladimir Pravdin, former rezident of the NKGB in New York. And in September 1944 Katz was freed of other liaisons (operations) and was assigned to work directly under Washington D.C. Rezident Anatoli Gromov. Gromov came to the United States to implement a new security program of isolating agents from each other by a complicated arrangement of cutouts.\n\nKatz and Bentley's operations in New York and Washington were very extensive. Bentley would eventually name more than 80 individuals who were providing information to the Soviet intelligence from a dozen government institutions.\n\nKatz informed Bentley at their first meeting in October 1944 that Gromov had been sent to the United States to improve security of NKGB operations. One aspect of this modernization was to have Bentley turn over to NKGB control all of her agents not previously surrendered to NKGB officers.\n\nAfter Bentley's defection Katz was assigned the task of killing her. Anatoly Gorsky sent a memorandum to Moscow about Elizabeth Bentley.(11) Allen Weinstein has pointed out: \"Gorsky discussed and rejected in his November 27 memo a variety of options: shooting Bentley (too noisy), arranging a car or subway accident (too risky), and faking a suicide (too chancy). In connection with the last option, Gorsky noted that he had selected agent \"X\" (Joseph Katz) for the task of eliminating Bentley... In the end, Gorsky decided that a slow-acting poison should be administered to Bentley, something \"X\" could place on a pillow or handkerchief or in her food.\" \n\nGorsky warned NKVD headquarters that Joseph Katz was not in good health and that Bentley might cause him problems as she was \"a very strong, tall and healthy woman, and \"X\" was not feeling well lately\". Eventually Gorsky was told that: \"No measures should be taken with regard to (Bentley).\" Gorsky was informed that it had been decided that Lavrentiy Beria would deal with Bentley. However, on 16 August 1947, Katz met the NKVD station chief in Paris to discuss the elimination of Bentley. It was reported that Katz was willing to take the assignment but at the last minute it was decided to abandon the idea.\n\nKatz moved to Western Europe to form a company for covering the illegal courier line between Europe and U.S. Katz lived in France from 1948 to 1951 then moved to Israel. His code names in the Venona project are \"X\" and \"Informer\".\n\n\n"}

Kennedy Memorial was the first memorial by famed American architect and Kennedy family friend Philip Johnson, and was approved by Jacqueline Kennedy. Johnson called it \"a place of quiet refuge, an enclosed place of thought and contemplation separated from the city around, but near the sky and earth.\" Dallas raised $200,000 for the memorial by August 1964, entirely from 50,000 individual donations contributed by private citizens.\n\nThe simple concrete memorial lies in the block bounded by Main, Record, Commerce, and Market Streets, approximately east of Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was assassinated. The block, also known as the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial Plaza, is in downtown Dallas near the Historic West End district, is owned by Dallas County.\n\nPhilip Johnson's design is a cenotaph, or empty tomb, that symbolizes the freedom of Kennedy's spirit. The memorial is a square, roofless room, tall and square with two narrow openings facing north and south. The walls consist of 72 white precast concrete columns, most of which end above the earth. Eight columns (two in each corner) extend to the ground, acting as legs that support the monument. Each column ends in a light fixture. At night, the lights create the illusion that the structure is supported by the light itself. The corners and \"doors\" of this roofless room are decorated with rows of concrete circles, or medallions, each identical and perfectly aligned. These decorations introduce the circular shape into the square architecture of the Kennedy Memorial.\n\nThe cenotaph lies atop a low concrete hill, embossed with squares and slightly elevated compared to street level. Inside is a low block of dark granite, square, set into a larger shallow depression. The granite square is decorated on its north and south faces with the name \"John Fitzgerald Kennedy\" carved in gold letters. It is too empty to be a base, too short to be a table, but too square to be a tomb. The letters have been painted gold to capture the light from the white floating column walls and the pale concrete floor. These words – three words of a famous name – are the only verbal messages in the empty room.\n\nTwo dark granite squares are set in the plaza surrounding the memorial, each approximately from the narrow entrances to the cenotaph. They are each inscribed with an epitaph that reads:\n\nDallas County Judge Lew Sterrett was credited as the first to propose a monument to Kennedy on November 24, 1963, two days after the assassination. The concept became a formal proposal on December 2, when Sterrett formed the John F. Kennedy Citizens Memorial Committee with Mayor Earle Cabell and two dozen prominent Dallas citizens. However, other Dallas civic leaders, including former mayor R.L. Thornton, said the memorial was better placed in Washington D.C., attempting to distance Dallas from the infamy it had gained as the assassination site. The Committee solicited designs for a memorial after its formation; 260 proposals were received within a week, and 700 proposals were received by February 1964.\n\nOn February 5, 1964, the Committee, led by W. Dawson Sterling, announced it had met for a fifth time to narrow down the proposals to three or four finalists. On February 22, 1964, the Committee announced that two memorials would be created: one at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, and another \"dignified and modest memorial near the assassination site\". The location near the Old Red Courthouse was chosen in April 1964. The original location, announced as the block bounded by Main, Elm, Record, and Market Streets, was shifted to another plaza one block south bounded by Main, Record, Market, and Commerce. Both plazas were owned by Dallas County and were being prepared as part of the new Dallas County Court House, then under construction. By September, the concept for the Kennedy Plaza included a green space with a modest marker.\n\nCommittee member Stanley Marcus flew to New York and successfully asked Philip Johnson to take on the memorial design, which he did for no fee. Johnson's proposal model was shown to the Committee in December 1964, and the Committee formally announced the design on December 12, hoping to demolish the existing buildings and have the memorial ready by November 1968, the fifth anniversary of the assassination. An underground parking facility was built under the memorial site, however, and construction did not start until 1969. The Committee stated in June 1969 the memorial was being constructed for a reasonable fee and would be dedicated by January 1, 1970. It was finally dedicated on June 24, 1970 in a ceremony attended by 300 people. Sargent Shriver was the first Kennedy family member to visit the memorial in 1972.\n\nThe memorial was vandalized with graffiti in the spring of 1999. In mid 1999, The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza undertook management of the memorial, rallying the support of Dallas County and the City of Dallas. The Museum became caretaker of the monument and launched a full-scale restoration project aimed at preserving the memorial and its history. Philip Johnson, the original architect for the monument, guided the restoration process implemented by Corgan Associates, Inc. and Phoenix I Restoration and Construction, Lt. Numerous local suppliers donated the labor, materials, and equipment required to return the memorial to its original beauty. In 2000, a panel of experts wrote an explanation of the memorial to satisfy the public.\n\nThe monument attracts approximately 500,000 visitors annually.\n\nSoon after the Kennedy Memorial was completed, Gary Cartwright wrote in 1971 for \"The New York Times\" the \"memorial seems esthetically spare, even forbidding\", true to the concept proposed by Johnson. In a 1999 interview with \"The Washington Post\", Johnson confirmed the concept: \"I don't think it's sterile, of course. I love it. The idea of going into an empty room with nothing to help you, except to think about the slain president, I think that's a very moving image.\" Cartwright also noted the memorial \"was erected, after much delay, by the city fathers of Dallas.\"\n\nArchitectural critic Witold Rybczynski wrote in 2006 that the monument is \"poorly done\", likening its precast concrete slab walls to \"mammoth Lego blocks\", and commented that Kennedy \"deserved better than this\". On the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, \"Dallas Morning News\" architecture critic Mark Lamster called the monument \"a disappointing product of the city's ambivalent response to the events of November 1963\" and said that Johnson lacked \"an animating vision that might have produced an inspiring design. This, in turn, was compounded by a lack of experience\". Lamster also noted the similarities between Johnson's design and the unrealized Neue Wache redesign proposal for a war memorial in Berlin, created in 1930 by Mies van der Rohe.\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne echoed these prior criticisms in 2013, stating the memorial \"symbolizes the city's deep ambivalence about commemorating the assassination. A spare cenotaph, or open tomb, designed to be built in marble, it was instead cast in cheaper concrete. And its location east of the assassination site suggested an effort to tuck the history of that day away.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In August he ordered an oil lamp which was delivered on 21 October and tested by him in the mine in the presence of explosive gases. He improved this over several weeks with the addition of capillary tubes at the base so that it gave more light and tried new versions on 4 and 30 November. This was presented to the Literary and Philosophical Society (Lit & Phil) of Newcastle upon Tyne on 5 December 1815.\n\nAlthough controversy arose between Stephenson's design and the Davy lamp (invented by Humphry Davy in the same year), Stephenson's original design worked on significantly different principles from Davy's final design. If the lamp were sealed except for a restricted air ingress (and a suitably sized chimney) then the presence of dangerous amounts of firedamp in the incoming air would (by its combustion) reduce the oxygen concentration inside the lamp so much that the flame would be extinguished. (Stephenson had convinced himself of the validity of this approach by his experiments with candles near lit blowers: as lit candles were placed upwind of the blower the blower flame grew duller; with enough upwind candles the blower flame went out.) To guard against the possibility of a flame travelling back through the incoming gases (an explosive backblast), air ingress was by a number of small-bore orifices through which the air flowed at a velocity higher than the velocity of the flame in a mixture of firedamp (mostly methane) and air. The body of the lamp was lengthened to give the flame a greater convective draw, and thus allow a greater inlet flow restriction and make the lamp less sensitive to air currents. Davy had originally attempted a safety lamp on similar principles, before preferring to enclose the flame inside a brass gauze cylinder; he had publicly identified the importance of allowing the restricted airflow in through \"small\" orifices (in which the flame velocity is lower) before Stephenson had, and he and his adherents remained convinced that Stephenson had not made this discovery independently.\n\nTwo advantages of Stephenson's design over Davy's was that if the proportion of firedamp became too high, his lamp would be extinguished, whereas Davy's lamp could become dangerously hot. This was illustrated in the Oaks colliery at Barnsley on 20 August 1857 where both types of lamp were in use.\n\nStephenson's design used paper to surround the flame, which cut out less of the light than Davy's, where the gauze surrounded it. But this also posed the danger of breakage in the harsh conditions of mineworking, a problem which was not resolved until the invention of safety glass. Stephenson tried several different designs in early years and later adopted Davy's gauze in preference to the tubes and it was this revised design that was used for most of the 19th century as the \"Geordie\" lamp.\n\nThe Geordie lamp continued to be used in the north-east of England through most of the 19th century, until the introduction of electric lighting.\n\n\nBibliography\n"}

The Benben stone (also known as a pyramidion) is the top stone of the pyramid. It is also related to the obelisk.\n\nIn the Pyramid Texts, e.g. Utterances 587 and 600, Atum himself is at times referred to as \"mound\". It was said to have turned into a small pyramid, located in Heliopolis (Egyptian: \"Annu\" or \"Iunu\"), within which Atum was said to dwell. Other cities developed their own myths of the primeval mound. At Memphis, the god Tatenen, an earth god and the origin of \"all things in the shape of food and viands, divine offers, all good things\", was the personification of the primeval mound.\n\nThe Benben stone, named after the mound, was a sacred stone in the temple of Ra at Heliopolis (Egyptian: \"Annu\" or \"Iunu\"). It was the location on which the first rays of the sun fell. It is thought to have been the prototype for later obelisks and the capstones of the great pyramids were based on its design. The capstone or the tip of the pyramid is also called a \"pyramidion\". In ancient Egypt, these were probably gilded so they shone in sunlight.\n\nMany Benben stones, often carved with images and inscriptions, are found in museums around the world.\n\nThe bird deity Bennu, which was probably the inspiration for the phoenix, was venerated at Heliopolis, where it was said to be living on the Benben stone or on the holy willow tree.\n\nAccording to Barry Kemp, the connection between the benben, the phoenix, and the sun may well have been based on alliteration: the rising, \"weben\", of the sun sending its rays towards the benben, on which the benu bird lives. Utterance 600, § 1652 of the Pyramid Texts speaks of Atum as \"you rose up, as the benben, in the Mansion of the Benu in Heliopolis\".\n\nFrom the earliest times, the portrayal of Benben was stylized in two ways; the first was as a pointed, pyramidal form, which was probably the model for pyramids and obelisks. The other form was round-topped; this was probably the origin of Benben as a free standing votive object and an object of veneration.\n\nDuring the Fifth Dynasty, the portrayal of benben was formalized as a squat obelisk. Later, during the Middle Kingdom, this became a long, thin obelisk.\n\nIn the Amarna Period tomb of Panehesy, the benben is seen as a large, round-topped stela standing on a raised platform.\n\n\n"}

He is the first of the seven Assistant District Attorneys who have been featured on \"Law & Order\", and the only one who was male. He appeared in 69 episodes.\n\nRobinette is introduced as having been raised in Harlem and worked his way through law school. He had the chance to work on Wall Street, but turned it down in favor of the Manhattan District Attorney's office, where he felt he could make a difference. He works under Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty). He was mentored as a teenager by Deputy Police Commander William Jefferson (Ron Foster), who inspired him to become a lawyer. In the pilot episode, \"Everybody's Favorite Bagman\", however, he and Stone discover that Jefferson is corrupt, and that he conspired to murder a city councilman.\n\nRobinette advocates racial equality through equal treatment, including equal punishment; while he abhors racism, he feels no sympathy for black people who break the law. He insists on being treated as the equal of his white colleagues, without what he feels are added advantages from affirmative action policies. However, numerous African Americans are at odds with his role in the judicial system, creating a recurring sense of deep inner conflict for the man.\n\nAs a result, Robinette's views on race change throughout the series. In the first season episode \"Out of the Half-Light\", Stone asks Robinette if he thinks of himself as \"a black lawyer or a lawyer who's black\". Robinette at first considers himself the latter, but by the time he leaves the DA's office and becomes a defense attorney, he thinks of race as a more integral part of his reasons for practicing law.\n\nRobinette leaves the DA's office at the end of the third season, and eventually becomes a defense attorney who represents his clients as victims of institutionalized racism. He is replaced by Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy).\n\nInitially, his disappearance from the show was never explained and was not mentioned in either the third season end or fourth season opener. NBC press releases at the time of the character's departure mentioned that Robinette had moved to a Park Avenue law firm. On the 4th season DVD, a deleted scene includes Lt. Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson) asking to see Robinette. Stone responds with \"Uh, you'll have to take a cab uptown. Park Avenue. Woodward, Martin, and Schwartz.\" \n\nRobinette has reappeared on the show three times: once in 1996, 2005 and 2006, as opposing counsel to Stone's successor, Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston). In the 1996 episode \"Custody\", he defends a black woman who attempted to kidnap her son from his white adoptive parents. In the 2005 episode \"Birthright\", he defends a nurse accused of performing sterilizations on promiscuous black teenagers whom she deems emotionally unfit to become parents. In the 2006 episode \"Fear America\", he defends a Muslim accused of murder who killed to cover up his terrorist activities. In that episode, Robinette accuses McCoy and the D.A.'s office of participating in a giant conspiracy to make every Muslim appear to be a terrorist. However, he maintains a respectful relationship with the DA's office, even sometimes having drinks with his now-opponents.\n\nIn 2017, Robinette travels to Chicago to defend CPD Officer Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins) at the request of Sergeant Hank Voight (Jason Beghe), where he goes up against Ben Stone's son, Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Peter Stone (Philip Winchester).\n"}
{"id": "1991270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991270", "title": "Yoseikan Budō", "text": "Yoseikan Budō\n\nYoseikan budō () (originally Yoseikan Ryu Gyokushin Jujutsu) may be classified as a \"sōgō budō\" form (, \"composite\" or \"comprehensive\" martial art), but is used here to indicate a martial art into which various martial ways have been integrated. It is probably most widely known for its descent from a pre-war style of \"Aikido\"; however, it has important connections to Judo, Karate, western Boxing, Savate and a traditional forms of Japanese combat known as Gyokushin-ryū Jujutsu and Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū.\n\nThe name of the art \"yō-sei-kan\" is derived from three Japanese characters, \"yō\" meaning 'teaching', \"sei\" meaning \"truth\", \"kan\" meaning \"place\", which may be translated roughly into English as \"the place where the truth is taught\" or alternately \"place for practising what is right\". The intent of the name was not to assert an exclusive possession of the truth regarding the martial arts but rather to describe how the comprehensive nature of the Yoseikan training environment allows an individual to discover their own sense of \"truth\" by studying a wide range of differing martial techniques, philosophies and principles.\n\nYoseikan Budo originated in 1931 as the style created by its founder Minoru Mochizuki (1907–2003), a high ranking student and assistant to Kanō Jigorō, the founder of judo and Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido, in the pre-World War II period. In addition to the very high ranks he held in these arts he was student of one of the oldest styles of traditional Japanese koryū budō, the Katori Shintō-ryō, and studied with various karate teachers including Gichin Funakoshi, the man who brought karate from the Okinawan islands to mainland Japan.\nThe old Yoseikan style included mainly jujutsu, aikijujutsu, kobudo and a few karate techniques, such as: foot sweeps and trips (\"ashi waza\"), standing throws (\"nage waza\") and groundwork (\"ne waza\"); punches, kicking and blocking techniques (\"kihon te waza\", \"kihon uke waza\", \"kihon geri waza\"); escapes (\"te hodoki\"), joints locks, bending or twisting (\"kansetsu waza\"), variation techniques (\"henka waza\"); sword, sticks and knife techniques; counter techniques (\"ura waza\"), chokes (\"shime waza\") and exclusive sacrifice techniques (\"sutemi waza\") as well as a number of solo and paired \"katas\" with and without weapons.\n\nA curious characteristic of the old style is that it did not support much of the esoteric ways that (some contend) evolved with post-World War II traditional Aikido and some of its offshoots. At one point Kisshomaru Ueshiba, the headmaster and son of the aikido founder, reputedly asked Mochizuki to refrain from using the name aikido to refer to the aiki portion of his system. The system although still employing the term aikido is also known to use the term \"aiki budo\" to refer to this part of the art. Minoru Mochizuki's 1932 licence from Ueshiba was in Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu as Ueshiba had not yet renamed the art he was teaching (which would come to be called Aikido). Still Mochizuki continued to enjoy a warm relationship with Morihei Ueshiba even in his later years.\n\nAlthough perhaps philosophically most influenced by Ueshiba (in addition to his technical studies), Mochizuk's method of teaching and systematizing his art seems to show a larger debt to the teachings of Kanō Jigorō, perhaps due to his own roots in judo. His method of developing kata and use of a scientific approach to explain the finer parts of his art seems to show the imprint of Kano's early teaching method. Indeed, it was Kano who originally sent Mochizuki, along with other judo teachers, to study aikido with Ueshiba for the purpose of bringing back the techniques for use in the Kodokan's self-defense program. Many of these aikido inspired techniques can be seen preserved in Kodokan Goshin Jutsu kata or forms of self-defense which were most likely introduced by Kenji Tomiki, another senior judo teacher, who trained with Mochizuki at Ueshiba's dojo. In Mochizuki's case perhaps Kano's plan to have judo players learn aikido worked too well, resulting in Minoru becoming a live-in student under Ueshiba and even once being asked to inherit the leadership of the art should Kisshomaru be unable to.\n\nMochizuki's inclination toward eclecticism can also be seen as part of the influence imparted to him from Kano's teachings.\nAs Kano had fused the forms of traditional jujutsu he had learned, with elements as different as ground work from the Fusen ryu and Western wrestling tactics so too did Mochizuki strive to learn many different arts in order to expand his overall understanding of fighting methods. Indeed, many of his early explorations in arts such as iaido, jodo and classical forms of jujutsu were at the suggestion of Kano during his time at the Kodokan. He expanded this to include an investigation of Western boxing, karate and classical Japanese swordsmanship. Conversely when he made the suggestion to Ueshiba that aikidoka might benefit from a knowledge of the skilled striking techniques employed by karate practitioners his suggestion met with no enthusiasm.\n\nOn a technical level the influence of judo great Kyuzo Mifune and classical jujutsu practitioner Sanjuro Oshima of the Gyokushin-ryu cannot be overstated. One of the specialties of the Yoseikan Budo system under Minoru Mochizuki came to be the use of sutemi-waza or sacrifice techniques, in which these two teachers excelled. Although the far greater influence was undoubtedly Mifune in whose lessons the youthful Mochizuki found much greater enthusiasm, the teaching of the Gyokushin theory of 'spherical spirit' stayed with Mochizuki over the years, inspiring him to invent new techniques with this art's principles in mind. Mochizuki also credited his quick mastery of aikido with having learned this style which held many techniques in common with Ueshiba's art.\n\nIn the context of contemporary aikido Minoru Mochizuki's art seems much jujutsu and judo based. Indeed, many strong judoka came to visit and train with the master throughout his life. One such person was Frenchman Patrick Auge who still maintains his own North American based organization. The type of budo practised by Auge represents very well the practises of Mochizuki Minoru from the 1970s and 1980s when Auge was a live-in student under Minoru at Yoseikan headquarters in Shizuoka. The senior teachers from the headquarters have now re-christened their school the Seifukan and seek to preserve the original style that they learned under Mochizuki-senior.\n\nYoseikan practitioners under Mochizuki Minoru were required to do a considerable amount of cross training in order to gain teaching credentials. This included gaining a minimum of a blackbelt in Judo in addition to training in Aikido, Karate and Katori Shinto Ryu and a brief six months training in Gyokushin-ryū Jujutsu under Sanjuro Oshima (he never fully learned it but decades later tried reconstruct Gyokushin-ryū techniques after witnessing Wrestling suplex throws in France). Techniques found in jojutsu and iaido were also included.\n\nThe following a sampling of some the techniques practised in Mochizuki's original basic curriculum:\n\n\nRandori or 'free practice' in both single and multi-opponent situations was also a part of everyday dojo training\n\nMinoru Mochizuki's son (b. 1936), Hiroo Mochizuki, studied martial arts under his father from a very young age. He studied widely, in the eclectic system of his father, but whereas his father had perhaps a particular talent for judo, his son had a greater affinity for karate. Studying in France from 1957 to 1958 as a university student, he returned to the country after the death of one of his father's students Jim Alcheik and took over the large following that was growing for the art in that country. He introduced new kata of his own invention, employing both Western and Eastern inspired techniques and introduced a form of point sparring for karate and kobudo tournament styles.\n\nHiroo must be seen as very successful both as a major innovator and a popularizer of the art, teaching it on a far larger scale than did his father, along with his connections to the quite large aikido based organizations such as the Fédération Française Libre D'Aïkido et de Budo.\n\nMinoru Mochizuki died in France in 2003, and before that, handed down the leadership role of the organization to Hiroo. Nowadays, few practitioners of the old style are found, as most went into the style of Yoseikan Budo created by Hiroo Mochizuki in the 1970s. The new style incorporates both traditional and modern \"budō\", including western arts such as Western boxing, savate, and others. The new system also includes sporting and competition aspects, with innovative equipment allowing for safe yet powerful competition. The sporting and competition aspects are but a small part of the modern \"budō\" system and serve as devices of education and to demonstrate the art to the rest of the world.\n\nThe Yoseikan Budo of Hiroo Mochizuki is a comprehensive Japanese martial art founded by Master Minoru Mochizuki and improved by his son’s own research into the arts. Its technique is based on shockwave movement, thus allowing more powerful hits with the energy use better spread across the body. For example, punches will always be triggered by a circular hip movement, creating a shockwave transmitted to the arm; arm muscles will only help to control the movement, most of the power is transmitted by the hips. The same applies for kicks and projections.\n\nSome of the hallmarks of Hiroo’s Yoseikan Budo is the use of atemi (using feet, fists, elbows and knees), projections (essentially techniques from judo), sacrifice techniques (sutemi), self-defense including dangerous techniques (various joint locks, elbow hits), groundwork (ne waza) with hold-ons and joint locks, and work with weapons (bokken, wood stick, knife). Hiroo’s Yoseikan is widely practiced in Japan and Europe. One of Minoru Mochizuki's students of the older style, Patrick Auge, lives in the U.S. but his focus is on Canada where the majority of that group's practitioners reside. The United States organization continues to be affiliated with Master Hiroo Mochizuki and the World Yoseikan Federation. Master Hiroo Mochizuki of France inherited the leadership of Yoseikan Budo from his father in 1999 and now heads the Ecole Mochizuki and guides the World Yoseikan Federation as a separate entity from the groups led by Auge and other senior Mochizuki students who formed the Seifukan Dojo after death of Minoru Mochizuki in the former Yoseikan headquarters dojo in Shizuoka, Japan.\n\nYoseikan Budo has gone through decades of changes, modernization and improvement. Minoru Sensei never wanted to \"freeze\" budo in an academic form and pursued a search for constant evolution and improvement, well represented by his own words, \"Never teach only what you have been taught\".\n\nMaster Hiroo improved on his father's system by adding a common link to all of the martial arts Yoseikan Budo uses. This is the \"vibration\" or \"undulation\" produced by the tanden—and called qi by the Chinese—that are used in every technique (atemis, throws, locks, weapons, etc.) while allowing the user to increase his power tremendously while remaining very lithe and supple in all situations.\n\nYoseikan Budo is now at the same time a very traditional martial art and a modern sport all rolled into one.\n\nYoseikan Budo used colored belts to signify progression in skill, but now all budoka wear a blue keikogi with a blue and white belt that represents the pulses a sine wave, without any distinctive rank marks. There are two major tiers of rank, the mudansha and the yudansha.\n\nThe standard competition involves three kinds of sparring:\n\nThe rules for this form of randori include only very few prohibitions, but it is practiced with complete protective equipment to avoid injuries. Almost all techniques are used. (The forbidden techniques are basically kicks to the knees, head grab or twist, and joint locks).\n\nAdditionally, there are also some specialized competitions:\n\nThe Kyoe Randori involves all techniques (atemi/aiki/jujutsu) and no protective gear, but combatants must keep perfect control over all the techniques.\n\nYoseikan Budo was introduced into Australia by Yoshiaki Unno a direct student of Minoru Mochizuki. The style was taught by Unno as separate disciples (Karate, Aikido, Kobudo and Iaido). The Australian representative of the World Yoseikan Federation (WYF) evolved from a club founded in 1980 by Stephen Weir one of Unno's first Karate students. This club originally taught traditional Karate as its primary art. Weir handed over control of this club to Roy Hebden in 1996. Due to the retirement of Unno and a loss of contact with Yoseikan Japan around 2001 instructor Roy Hebden approached Hiroo Mochizuki to reconfirm the club's loyalty to the parent organisation. Yoseikan Budo Australia became directly affiliated to the Yoseikan World Federation, now the WYF, in 2002. Yoseikan Budo also remains affiliated to the Australian Karate Federation. Hebden was appointed the Australian WYF representative and has made many visits to France to train directly under Mochizuki and his senior instructors to learn Yoseikan Budo and ensure the club is now able to develop Yoseikan Budo using the principles developed by Hiroo Mochizuki. This club is based in Western Australia. Another of Unno's students, Ross Taylor, 5th Dan, heads the West Coast Aikido Martial Arts Academy in Wangara, Western Australia, and continues the teachings of Minoru Mochizuki and Unno.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1991275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991275", "title": "Imperial Crown of Austria", "text": "Imperial Crown of Austria\n\nThe Imperial Crown of Austria () was made in 1602 in Prague by Jan Vermeyen as the personal crown of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, and therefore is also known as the Crown of Emperor Rudolf II (). The crown was used as a private crown of the Holy Roman Emperors and Kings of Hungary and Bohemia from the House of Habsburg. In 1804 it became the official crown of the newly constituted Austrian Empire. After 1867 it remained the imperial crown of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918.\n\nThe Imperial Crown consists of three principal elements possessing great symbolic significance: the circlet, the high arch, and the mitre.\n\nThe circlet is dominated by eight large squares of diamonds, forming a crown in itself, which symbolises royal authority. Between the stones are two large pearls arranged vertically and set within white enamel rosettes surrounded by scrollwork. From the circlet emerge eight lilies, which were probably inspired by the Bohemian Crown of St. Wenceslas. The lilies are also associated with the fleurs-de-lis of the House of Valois. The use of eight elements was also taken from the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire, which includes a circlet made out of eight plates. In the circlet are precious stones such as spinels, zircons, and pearls. The zircons are cut in such a way that they are flat at the front. Preparing precious stones for mounting in this way was a relatively new technique at the time the crown was made. The pearls were added by Alexander Emmanuel Köchert of the A. E. Köchert shop in Vienna.\n\nThe mitre symbolises the divine right to rule, and the spiritual position of the emperor, who during coronation was consecrated symbolically as a deacon. The mitre fills the left and right sides of the crown, leaving an opening in the middle through which the high arch passes. The mitre is made of gold, with a band of enamel work depicting birds and plants. The mitre is divided into four sections representing the high honours of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The first section shows him kneeling, receiving the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire in Regensburg as Holy Roman Emperor. The second section shows him riding onto the coronation hill in Pressburg (Bratislava) during his coronation as King of Hungary. The third section shows his coronation procession through Prague as King of Bohemia. The fourth section depicts an allegory of his victory over the invading Turks. The Latin inscription inside the arch reads, \"RVDOLPHVS II ROM(ANORVM) IMP(ERATOR) AVGVSTUS HVNG(ARIAE) ET BOH(EMIAE) REX CONSTRVXIT MDCII\" (\"Rudolf II, August Emperor of the Romans, King of Hungary and Bohemia, Constructed in 1602\").\n\nThe high arch was inspired by the arch of the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. It rises from the front and back of the circlet and is studded with eight diamonds, which symbolise Christ. The emperor was regarded as governor on earth in the name of Christ. At the top of the arch is a blue-green emerald, which symbolises heaven. The emerald was not cut, but polished.\n\nSince the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Empire, including the Crown, were kept in Nuremberg and could only leave the city for a coronation, some rulers had their own personal crowns made. For example, when they attended a session of the Imperial Diet (\"Reichstag\"), they attended with their own crowns. The oldest depiction of such a private crown is an etching by the artist Albrecht Dürer of Emperor Maximilian I, where a depiction of a crown is seen that might have later influenced the appearance of the crown of Rudolf II.\n\nThe Imperial Crown of the Habsburg Empire of Austria was never used for a coronation, since, unlike the Holy Roman Empire, it was a hereditary monarchy and such an act of legitimization was not seen as necessary. The ceremony held was an act of investiture to mark the monarch's official ascension to the throne rather than a coronation.\n\nThe crown of Rudolf II was made in 1602 in Prague by Jan Vermeyen, one of the most outstanding goldsmiths of his time, who was called specially from Antwerp. The crown is made out of three parts: the circlet (\"Kronreif\"), the high arch (\"Kronbügel\"), and a mitre (\"Mitra\").\n\nIn the earlier forms of the Western mitre the peaks or ‘horns’ were over the ears, rather than over the face and back of the head. The form of mitre used in the imperial mitral crown preserved this earlier form. This form of the imperial mitre-crown can be seen in the extant portraits of such emperors as Frederick III and Maximilian I The bronze effigy of Maximilian I found on his monumental cenotaph in the court church in Innsbruck has a crown with two arches which cross over the top of the mitre and the unique form of the imperial crown adopted by Maximilian as Emperor of Mexico appears to have been modeled on this form, but with the half-arches and the eagles on the circlet on the front, back and sides. In the later 17th century Baroque form of mitral crown of Leopold I the peaks of the mitre have been rounded into the hemispherical form Peter the Great would adopt as the Imperial Crown of Russia when he took the title emperor as Russian sovereign.\n\nAlthough it is often assumed that the Imperial Crown made for Otto I with its single arch over its inner red cap was the original prototype for the western imperial crown, it is also possible that the Byzantine imperial crown, which in the twelfth century also became closed with two arches, inspired the western emperors to follow their example and also close their crowns with such a pair of arches.\n\nThe Imperial Crown is associated with the Imperial Orb and Sceptre, and they are displayed together in the Imperial Treasury at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria. The Imperial Orb was commissioned in 1612 by Rudolf's brother and successor, Holy Roman Emperor Matthias, and was created by Andreas Ochsenbruck. The shape takes its inspiration from the crown, especially the enamel-work which is in the same style. It is topped by a large sapphire. A peculiarity of the Sceptre is that it was said to be made from unicorn horn, but in fact it was made from the horn of a narwhal. The Imperial Orb and Sceptre were already in use before the proclamation of the Austrian Empire, as Bohemian royal regalia and for the hereditary private estates (\"Erbhuldigung\") of the Archduchy of Austria.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The country's best result is a second-place finish for Kristian Kostov and the song \"Beautiful Mess\" at the contest also in Kiev.\n\nBulgaria has failed to qualify for the final in eight out of twelve appearances at the contest, most narrowly in , when Sofi Marinova lost out on the 10th qualifying place from the second semi-final in a tie-break with Norway. However, on three of the four occasions that they have reached the final, they have finished in the top five: placing fifth with Elitsa & Stoyan in , fourth with Poli Genova in and second with Kristian Kostov in . Bulgaria reached the final for the fourth time in 2018, with supergroup Equinox placing 14th.\n\nBulgaria first competed at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, represented by the jazz-inspired band Kaffe with their song \"Lorraine\". Receiving only 49 points, they placed 19th in the semi-final and failed to qualify to the final. They were succeeded by Mariana Popova with \"Let Me Cry\", however she also failed to qualify for the final, coming 17th with 36 points in the semi-final.\n\nBulgaria's first qualification for the final came in 2007 when Elitsa Todorova & Stoyan Yankoulov performed the song \"Water\" (Bulgarian: Voda/Вода). This was the first Bulgarian language song to compete in the contest, placing 6th in the semi-final with 146 points. Todorova and Yankulov repeated their song in the final and received 157 points, placing 5th in a field of 24.\n\nIn previous years, if a country placed in the top 10 countries in the final they automatically qualified to the final of the next contest. Had this rule remained for the 2008 contest, Bulgaria would have directly qualified for the final. However, a change in rules due to the large intake of countries participating in the contest meant that only five countries, the host country and the Big 4 countries, would automatically qualify to the final. As such, Bulgaria were forced to compete in one of the two semi-finals of the 2008 contest in Serbia.\n\nAt the 2008 contest, Bulgaria were represented by Deep Zone & Balthazar with the song \"DJ, Take Me Away\". They, however, could not repeat Todorova and Yankulov's result and received only 56 points, placing 11th of 19 competing.\n\nBulgaria competed in the 2009 contest in Russia. Bulgaria was the first country to begin their selection for the fifth Bulgarian entry to Eurovision, with 'Be A Star', the national final, beginning in October 2008.\nThe winner was Krassimir Avramov with his \"Popera\" song Illusion. It failed to qualify for the final in Moscow coming 16th out of 18 participants in the first semifinal.\n\nIn October 2009, BNT announced that Miroslav Kostadinov would represent Bulgaria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, Norway. He sang the song \"Angel si ti\" (Ангел си ти). It was the first song since 2007 to be sung in Bulgarian. However, for the third consecutive year, Bulgaria's entry failed to qualify for the final, coming 15th out of 17 participants in the semifinal.\n\nIn 2011, Bulgaria was represented by Poli Genova, and the country's entry was sung in Bulgarian for the second consecutive year. Her song was called \"Na Inat\", translated as \"For Spite\", and missed out on a place for the final after coming 12th in the second semi-final, making 2011 the fourth year in a row that Bulgaria didn't reach the final. In that year she competed with 18 more singers in the final of \"EuroBGvision\" (where by means of SMS voting the TV audience selects who will represent Bulgaria in the Eurovision Song Contest). This was her fourth time in which she took part in the \"EuroBGvision\" and her first win.\n\nThe singer Sofi Marinova represented Bulgaria in the 2012 Eurovision contest in Baku with a song called Love Unlimited (Bulgarian: Lubov bez granitsi/Любов без граници). Her song was mainly in Bulgarian but it also contains the phrase 'I Love You' in 12 other languages including Turkish, Greek, Spanish, French and Serbian and others. Bulgaria's entry tied with Norway for 10th place in its semifinal; however, the tie broke in favor of Norway because it received points from more countries, making 2012 the fifth year in a row that Bulgaria didn't proceed and sing in the final.\n\nIn 2013, Elitsa Todorova and Stoyan Yankoulov were chosen through an internal selection to represent Bulgaria for a second time, this time in Malmö. Their song, Samo shampioni (Bulgarian: Само Шампиони), placed sixth in the second semifinal's televoting results, but 17th place (last) in the jury's results. The duo placed twelfth, with 45 points, thereby excluding Bulgaria from the final yet again.\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Bulgaria announced that they would not be participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 due to financial problems.\n\nOn 15 September 2014, it was announced that Bulgaria had submitted a preliminary application to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015, but one month later it was announced that they would not be returning to the contest. On 31 October 2014, it was announced that Bulgaria's participation was still undecided due to the political situation of the country. The EBU granted an extension and awaited a final decision. On 18 December 2014, BNT confirmed via their official Eurovision Twitter account that they would not take part in the 2015 Contest.\n\nOn 15 September 2015, it was announced that BNT sent a preliminary application in order to compete in the 2016 contest, and the effective participation was further confirmed on 26 November 2015, thus marking the return of the country. Poli Genova represented Bulgaria for the second time (the first time being in 2011) Poli performed twelfth at the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in 5th place on 220 points.In the final on 14 May 2016, she performed eighth and placed 4th of 26 with 307 points.\nIn 2017, Kristian Kostov represented Bulgaria with the song \"Beautiful Mess\", he is the first singer at Eurovision to have been born in the 2000s decade. He placed 1st in the second semifinal, with 403 points, qualifying Bulgaria to the finals for the 3rd time. Kristian Kostov ended up getting the best result to Bulgaria so far, reaching the 2nd place, with 615 points, 143 points away from the winner Salvador Sobral (Portugal) who finished with 758 points.\n\nIn 2018 BNT selected Equinox with song Bones. The group performed tenth at the first semi-final and qualified for the final by placed 7th with 177 points. Bulgaria reached the final for the fourth time, finishing 14th with 166 points.\n\nOn 10 September 2018, it was announced that Bulgaria had submitted a preliminary application to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, but on 15 October 2018, BNT announced that they would not take part in the contest in Tel Aviv, Israel due to financial difficulties.\n\nIn October 2019, BNT announced that Bulgaria would return for the contest in Rotterdam. The country internally selected its entry for the contest, and Victoria was revealed as the artist on 25 November 2019.\n\nThe public broadcaster of each participating country in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU's contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event. The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the contestants, songwriters, composers and backing vocalists, among others.\n"}

He has since lived everywhere from North and South Carolina, to Jacksonville (graduating from The Bolles School), Miami, and Gainesville, Florida, to New Orleans, Los Angeles, Houston, Cleveland, spending most of his formative years in Rochester, Minnesota. He later moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he received an honors degree in philosophy from the University of Chicago. He was very involved in the music, and skateboarding scene as a youth. Joining the band Nine Inch Nails upon graduation from college, Brian lived with Trent Reznor in New Orleans for a while, working on the Grammy Award-winning \"Broken\" before the band relocated to Los Angeles, or more specifically, the Sharon Tate house to record \"The Downward Spiral\".\n\nAfter leaving Nine Inch Nails, Brian was the producer, guitarist and founding member of the Industrial rock band Filter along with Richard Patrick. Filter was formed in 1993 in Cleveland Ohio. The album \"Short Bus\" was released on April 25, 1995 and it sold over one million copies and features Brian's work with the band. It was recorded \"in a small brick house somewhere in Chicago\". It is best known for the hit single \"Hey Man Nice Shot\", reputedly about Budd Dwyer's public suicide; but the duo had hits on many soundtracks, working with The Crystal Method and The Dust Brothers. They embarked on an exhaustive world tour, as headliners, and opening for the likes of the Smashing Pumpkins, Ozzy Osbourne, White Zombie and more... The duo was also nominated for \"Best New Band\" at the MTV music awards. Brian has been mentioned on each Filter CD released since then in the liner notes, but he actually left the band during the summer of 1997. He and Richard Patrick have remained friends, and Brian contributed some production work and guitar/keyboard parts to the latest Filter record, \"The Trouble with Angels\" as well as \"Fades Like a Photograph\" from the movie \"2012\".\n\nSince leaving Filter, Brian produced, wrote, and played on Veruca Salt's \"Resolver\" record, and started planting the seeds of the band Ashtar Command with Chris Holmes, writing songs for Sinead O'Connor and more... Also during this time, Brian worked on Billy Corgan's solo album. The record being mostly electronic in nature, he worked closely with Billy, Bon Harris (Nitzer Ebb), and Matt Walker (original Filter drummer, Smashing Pumpkins, and Morrissey). The live band was nicknamed \"The Fellowship of Broken Toys\". They finished touring for Corgan's album \"TheFutureEmbrace\" in August 2005.\n\nLiesegang is currently spending all his time as the co-founder of Ashtar Command with writing and producer partner Chris Holmes. The music of Brian and Ashtar Command has been featured in many places, from Nissan car commercial, Microsoft campaigns, \"The O.C.\", \"Ugly Betty\", \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"The Avengers\" movie soundtrack, Rockstar Games' \"Red Dead Redemption\" (for which they were nominated for video game song of the year), The Sims, Capcom's Dead Rising, FIFA 2014, and many more. He has recently been working with Disney on their new interactive \"Fantasia:Music Evolved\", contributed the closing track to the latest Percy Jackson film, and has been working with Chris Holmes as Sir Paul McCartney's official remixers.\n"}

{"id": "1991286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991286", "title": "Harem (zoology)", "text": "Harem (zoology)\n\nA harem is an animal group consisting of one or two males, a number of females, and their offspring. The dominant male drives off other males and maintains the unity of the group. If present, the second male is subservient to the dominant male. As juvenile males grow, they leave the group and roam as solitary individuals or join bachelor herds. Females in the group may be inter-related. The dominant male mates with the females as they become sexually active and drives off competitors, until he is displaced by another male. In some species, incoming males that achieve dominant status may commit infanticide.\n\nFor the male, the primary benefits of the harem system is obtaining exclusive access to a group of mature females. The females benefit from being in a stable social group and the associated benefits of grooming, predator avoidance and cooperative defense of territory. The disadvantages for the male are the energetic costs of gaining or defending a harem which may leave him with reduced reproductive success. The females are disadvantaged if their offspring are killed during dominance battles or by incoming males.\n\nThe term harem is used in zoology to distinguish social organization consisting of a group of females, their offspring, and one to two males.\n\nThe single male, called the dominant male, may be accompanied by another young male, called a \"follower\" male. Females that closely associate with the dominant male are called \"central females,\" while females who associate less frequently with the dominant male are called \"peripheral females.\" Juvenile male offspring leave the harem and live either solitarily, or, with other young males in groups known as bachelor herds. Sexually mature female offspring may stay within their natal harem, or may join another harem. The females in a harem may be, but are not exclusively, genetically related. For instance, the females in hamadryas baboon harems are not usually genetically related because their harems are formed by \"kidnapping\" females from other harems and subsequent herding. In contrast, gelada harems are based on kinship ties to genetically related females. Multiple harems may assemble into larger groups known as \"clans\" or \"teams\".\n\nHarem cohesiveness is mediated by the dominant male who fights off invading males to keep claim over the harem. In some harem-forming species, when a dominant male vacates his harem (due to death, defection to another harem, or usurpation) the incoming male sometimes commits infanticide of the offspring. Because time and resources are no longer being devoted to the offspring, infanticide often stimulates the female to return to sexual receptivity and fertility sooner than if the offspring were to survive. Furthermore, while lactating, females do not ovulate and consequently are not fertile. Infanticide therefore has the potential to increase the incoming male's reproductive success.\n\nHarems are beneficial social structure for the dominant male, as it allows him access to several reproductively available females at a time. Harems provide protection for the females within a particular harem, as dominant males will fiercely ward off potential invaders. This level of protection may also, such in the case of the common pheasant, reduce the energy in female expended on remaining alert to, or fleeing from, invading males. Harems allow bonding and socialization among the female members, which can result in greater control over access to females as determined by the females' preferences. Harems also facilitate socialized behavior such as grooming and cooperative defense of territory.\n\nHarems can prove energetically costly for both males and females. Males spend substantial amounts of energy engaging in battles to invade a harem, or to keep hold of a harem once dominance has been established. Such energy expenditure can result in reduced reproductive success such in the case of red deer. This is especially true when there is high turnover rates of dominant males, as frequent intense fighting can result in great expenditure of energy. High turnover rate of dominant males can also be energetically costly for the females as their offspring are frequently killed in harems where infanticide occurs. Harems can also negatively affect females if there is intra-harem competition among females for resources.\nA lower-cost alternative mating strategy, useful to bachelors without a harem, is kleptogyny or the \"sneaky fucker strategy\", sneaking in to mate while the harem owner is distracted: in the case of red deer, when the harem stag is involved in a fight with another older stag. The strategy is also recorded in the elephant seal.\n\nAnimals that form harems include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The effect was discovered independently by many different photographers often by mistake in the days of C-22 and E-4. Color cross processed photographs are often characterized by unnatural colors and high contrast. The results of cross processing differ from case to case, as the results are determined by many factors such as the make and type of the film used, the amount of light exposed onto the film and the chemical used to develop the film. Similar effects can also be achieved with digital filter effects.\n\nCross processing usually involves one of the two following methods.\nHowever, cross processing can take other forms, such as negative color print film or positive color reversal film in black and white developer.\n\nOther interesting effects can be obtained by bleaching color films processed in black and white chemistry using a hydrochloric acid dichromate mixture or using potassium triiodide (KI) solution. If these bleached films are then re-exposed to light and re-processed in their intended color chemistry, subtle, relatively low contrast, pastel effects are obtained.\n\nCross processing effects can be simulated in digital photography by a number of techniques involving the manipulation of contrast/brightness, hue/saturation and curves in image editors such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.

He spent 15 seasons with Irish province Munster, during which time he had loan spells with English teams Saracens and Newcastle, before moving to England with Bath, Sale and Worcester. Internationally, Stringer represented Ireland and the Barbarians. He announced his retirement from rugby in June 2018.\n\nStringer made his Munster debut against Ulster on 3 October 1998, in an Irish Inter-Provincial Championship game. He made his Heineken Cup debut for Munster against Perpignan on 10 October 1998.\n\nHe was Munster's first-choice scrum-half for the 2000 Heineken Cup Final against Northampton Saints, a game which Munster lost 8–9. Stringer was again at scrum-half for Munster in the 2002 Heineken Cup Final against Leicester Tigers, which Leicester won 15–9. This game also involved the infamous 'Hand of Back' incident, in which Neil Back, the Leicester flanker, knocked the ball out of Stringer's hands during his put-in to a Munster scrum near the Leicester try-line, ultimately denying Munster any chance of a comeback .\n\nStringer's first silverware with Munster came in February 2003, when they secured the 2002–03 Celtic League. He was also Munster's scrum-half when they beat Llanelli Scarlets to win the Celtic Cup in May 2005.\n\nStringer played a key role for Munster during the 2005–06 Heineken Cup, helping the team reach their third final. Before the 2006 Heineken Cup Final, Stringer was criticised for not scoring enough tries. During the final, he saw that Biarritz's scrum-half, Dimitri Yachvili, was out of position, and Stringer quickly scored Munster's second try , helping to secure a 23–19 win, and Munster's first European Cup.\n\nDuring the 2007–08 Heineken Cup, Stringer lost his place in the Munster team to Tomás O'Leary. He was on the bench for Munster's 16–13 win over Toulouse in the 2008 Heineken Cup Final, but did not come on.\n\nHe was part of the Munster team that won the 2008–09 Celtic League, and was on the bench when Munster won the 2011 Celtic League Grand Final, beating rivals and newly crowned Heineken Cup Champions Leinster 19–9 in Thomond Park.\n\nDuring the 2010–11 season, Stringer also became Munster's most capped player ever, overtaking the record previously held by Alan Quinlan. He achieved the feat when he came on as a substitute in Munster's Celtic League victory against Leinster on 2 April 2011.\n\nOn 27 March 2012, while still on loan with Newcastle, Stringer signed a deal to extend his Munster contract by one year.\n\nOn 3 December 2011, it was announced that Stringer would join Aviva Premiership side Saracens on a three-month loan. He officially joined up with Saracens on 5 December 2011. He made his debut for Saracens in their Heineken Cup pool fixture against Ospreys on 10 December 2011. He made his first appearance in the Aviva Premiership for Saracens against Harlequins on 27 December 2011. He scored his first try for the club in the Anglo-Welsh Cup game against Worcester Warriors on 29 January 2012. Stringer's last game for Saracens was against Northampton Saints on 4 March 2012.\n\nMunster confirmed on 23 February 2012 that Stringer would join another Aviva Premiership side, Newcastle Falcons, on loan immediately after the conclusion of his loan at Saracens, and would be there until the end of the 2011–12 season. He joined up with the club officially on 13 March 2012. Stringer made his debut for Newcastle on 23 March 2012, against Worcester Warriors in the Aviva Premiership. He scored his first try for Newcastle in his last game for the club, during the relegation-decider against London Wasps, which Newcastle won 14–10.\n\nIt was announced on 21 January 2013 that Stringer would return to the Aviva Premiership for a third time, this time on loan with Bath Rugby as cover for injured first-choice scrum-half Michael Claassens. He scored two tries on his debut with Bath. Stringer agreed an extension to his loan deal with Bath in March 2013, which saw him stay with the side until the end of the 2012–13 season. It was announced on 9 April 2013 that Stringer had signed a one-year contract with Bath, which saw him join the club as a full-time player from the 2013–14 season. Stringer signed a new one-year contract with Bath in March 2014.\n\nOn 19 May 2015, it was announced Stringer had signed a one-year deal with Sale Sharks. In February 2016, Stringer signed a one-year contract extension with Sale. In April 2016, Stringer was named the Sale Sharks Player of the Year for the 2015–16 season. At the end of the 2016–17 season, Sale announced that Stringer would be leaving the club, while Stringer himself declared his intention to continue playing professional rugby.\n\nOn 20 July 2017, Worcester Warriors announced that they had signed Stringer on a six-month contract to cover Francois Hougaard while he is on international duty. The contract meant Stringer would be playing professional rugby as a 40-year-old and would join his longtime Munster and Ireland teammate Donncha O'Callaghan at the club.\n\nIn February 2000, Stringer made his debut for Ireland against Scotland in the 2000 Six Nations Championship. Between then and 2006, he appeared in 76 out of Ireland's 85 matches. He quickly became known for his ability to take down larger players, especially with one handed \"Ankle taps\" , and game changing moments.\n\nStringer was part of the Ireland teams that won the Six Nations Triple Crown in 2004, 2006, and 2007\n\nOn 14 March 2009, Stringer put in a Man-of-the-Match performance for Ireland against Scotland during the 2009 Six Nations Championship. Losing 12–9 at half-time in Murrayfield, Stringer made a break and passed to Jamie Heaslip, who scored a match-turning try that eventually saw Ireland win 15–22. A week later, Stringer came off the bench during Ireland's final 2009 Six Nations game against Wales. In the dying minutes of the game, Stringer passed the ball from a ruck to Ronan O'Gara, who then scored the drop-goal that won Ireland's first Grand Slam since 1948.\n\nStringer was selected in Ireland's squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and played in all five of Ireland's games at the tournament. He was also in the 2007 Rugby World Cup squad, but only played in two pool games at the tournament. Stringer was included in Ireland's squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup warm-ups in August, but did not feature in any of the warm-up tests and was not selected in the final 30-man squad for the World Cup in New Zealand.\nHis last match for Ireland came in the 2011 Six Nations Championship in a 24-8 win against England on 19 March.\n\nOn 12 August 2000, Stringer played for the Barbarians against Germany. He was invited to play for the side again, this time playing against Australia on 26 November 2011.\n\nStringer married Debbie O’Leary in the Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación Church in Plaza de la Iglesia in the old town of Marbella, Spain, on 9 June 2015.

This course involves a process of exploring and sharing students' views on \"\"knowledge questions\"\" (an umbrella term for \"everything that can be approached from a TOK point of view\"), so \"there is no end to the valid questions that may arise\", \"there are many different ways to approach TOK,\" \"the sheer scope of the TOK course is daunting\" and \"teachers and students need the confidence to go too far outside their traditional comfort zones.\" Teachers are entitled to select a teaching methodology and course material that will convey the theoretical foundation of essential concepts and may provide an environment in which these concepts can be discussed and debated. The focus of the discussion should not be the differentiation between \"right\" and \"wrong\" ideas but on the quality of justification and a balanced approach to the knowledge claim in question.\n\nThe TOK course uses a combination, in no particular order (\"many entry points and sequences are possible\"):\n\nThe TOK course is expected to involve 100 teaching hours over the two years of the Diploma Programme. Having followed the course, students should be competent to analyse knowledge claims and respond to knowledge issues in the context of different areas of knowledge and ways of knowing, expressing ideas accurately and honestly, using examples from their own experiences as learners and in outside life.\n\n\n\nTheory of knowledge is assessed in two parts: an externally examined 1,200–1,600 word essay and an internally assessed presentation. Each part is scored using assessment criteria (four criteria for the essay and four for the presentation) that describe levels of achievement (e.g., \"\"The inquiry explores knowledge issues. Most points are justified; most arguments are coherent. Some counterclaims are considered.\"\" describes level 5–6 in one of the essay criteria). The total score is converted into a grade from A to E. A similar system is used for the extended essay and students can gain up to 3 points for the diploma based on the grades achieved for TOK and EE. No diploma is awarded if a candidate fails to submit either the TOK essay or TOK presentation, or receives grade E for either the extended essay or theory of knowledge.\n\nFor each exam session the IB prescribes 6 essay titles from which students must choose, e.g., \"\"All knowledge claims should be open to rational criticism. On what grounds and to what extent would you agree with this assertion?\"\" Each title raises generic cross-disciplinary questions about knowledge, and the student is expected to consider the issues raised in the title and reach conclusions about them. The essay should put forward claims and counterclaims, linking knowledge issues to areas of knowledge and ways of knowing, and show evidence of original thinking by the student. Essays over the maximum word count of 1,600 are penalised with a one mark reduction, and any content beyond the 1600th word of the essay is not read by the examiner.\n\nDuring the Theory of Knowledge course, students must plan and deliver at least one (in individual or small group, maximum three students) presentation to the class. The topic is based on a real-life situation of interest to the student, e.g. \"Reliability of media reporting of science\", \"What makes something a work of art?\" and the presentation is expected to show why the topic is significant, linking it to a relevant main knowledge question (KQ), and discussing those issues and examining the implications of approaching the question from different perspectives, given by WOKs (ways of knowing), taken through one or two of the AOKs (Areas of knowledge). Teachers have wide latitude to help with topic selection and identifying suitable approaches. About ten minutes should be allowed for each presenter, and almost any form is permitted (e.g. debates, games, skits, interviews etc.) except reading an essay aloud.

He entered the 18th Regiment of Foot in 1779 and was part of the Gibraltar garrison. He transferred to the New South Wales Corps in October 1789 and arrived in Sydney on the Second Fleet ship \"Scarborough\" in June 1790.\n\nTownson spent most of his military service in the colony at Norfolk Island where he was stationed for six years and received a twenty-acre (81,000 m²) lease. In 1794 he was a member of the court of inquiry investigating Lieutenant Governor King's actions during the 1793 mutiny on the island. He was promoted and captain, and from September 1796 to November 1799 acted as lieutenant-governor of Norfolk Island while King was absent in England.\n\nHis administration was generally efficient and he seems to have had a steadying influence on the population of convicts and settlers. During his regime, the only ship built on the island, the sloop \"Norfolk\", used by Matthew Flinders to circumnavigate Van Diemen's Land, was constructed in 1798. He lacked confidence in Governor Hunter and his complaints to England played a part in Hunter's recall.\n\nTownson left Norfolk Island in 1800 and returned to England, where through illness he retired and sold his commission in July 1803.\n\nHe returned to Sydney in 1806, and after come controversy was granted 2000 acres (8 km²) in the Bexley and Hurstville districts.

This private space has been traditionally understood as serving the purposes of maintaining the modesty, privilege, and protection of women. A harem may house a man's wife — or wives and concubines, as in royal harems of the past — their pre-pubescent male children, unmarried daughters, female domestic workers, and other unmarried female relatives. In former times some harems were guarded by eunuchs who were allowed inside. The structure of the harem and the extent of monogamy or polygamy has varied depending on the family's personalities, socio-economic status, and local customs. Similar institutions have been common in other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations, especially among royal and upper-class families, and the term is sometimes used in other contexts. In traditional Persian residential architecture the women's quarters were known as \"andaruni\" (Persian: اندرونی; meaning inside, and in the Indian subcontinent as \"zenana\" (Persian: زنانه).\n\nAlthough the institution has experienced a sharp decline in the modern era due to a rise in education and economic opportunities for women, as well as Western influences, seclusion of women is still practiced in some parts of the world, such as rural Afghanistan and conservative states of the Persian Gulf region.\n\nIn the West, Orientalist imaginary conceptions of the harem as a hidden world of sexual subjugation where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses have influenced many paintings, stage productions, films and literary works. Some earlier European Renaissance paintings dating to the 16th century portray the women of the Ottoman harem as individuals of status and political significance. In many periods of Islamic history, women in the harem exercised various degrees of political power, such as the Sultanate of Women in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe word has been recorded in the English language since early 17th century. It comes from the Arabic \"ḥarīm\", which can mean \"a sacred inviolable place\", \"harem\" or \"female members of the family\". In English the term harem can mean also \"the wives (or concubines) of a polygamous man.\" The triliteral \"Ḥ-R-M\" appears in other terms related to the notion of interdiction such as \"haram\" (forbidden), \"mahram\" (unmarriageable relative), \"ihram\" (a pilgrim's state of ritual consecration during the Hajj) and \"al-Ḥaram al-Šarīf\" (\"the noble sanctuary\", which can refer to the Temple Mount or the sanctuary of Mecca).\n\nIn Turkish of the Ottoman era, the harem, i.e., the part of the house reserved for women was called \"haremlik\", while the space open for men was known as \"selamlık\".\n\nThe practice of female seclusion is not exclusive to Islam, but the English word harem usually denotes the domestic space reserved for women in Muslim households. Some scholars have used the term to refer to polygynous royal households throughout history.\n\nLeila Ahmed describes the \"ideal of seclusion\" as a \"a man's right to keep his women concealed—invisible to other men.\" Ahmed identifies the practice of seclusion as a social ideal and one of the major factors that shaped the lives of women in the Mediterranean Middle East. For example, contemporary sources from the Byzantine Empire describe the social mores that governed women's lives. Women were not supposed to be seen in public. They were guarded by eunuchs and could only leave the home \"veiled and suitably chaperoned.\" Some of these customs were borrowed from the Persians, but Greek society also influenced the development of patriarchal tradition.\n\nThe ideal of seclusion was not fully realized as social reality. This was in part because working class women often held jobs that required interaction with men. In the Byzantine empire, the very ideal of gender segregation created economic opportunities for women as midwives, doctors, bath attendants and artisans, since it was considered inappropriate for men to attend to women's needs. At times women lent and invested money and engaged in other commercial activities.\n\nFemale seclusion has historically signaled social and economic prestige. Eventually, the norms of female seclusion spread beyond the elites, but the practice remained characteristic of upper and middle classes, for whom the financial ability to allow one's wife to remain at home was a mark of high status. In some regions, such as the Arabian peninsula, seclusion of women was practiced by poor families at the cost of great hardship, but it was generally economically unrealistic for the lower classes.\n\nWhere historical evidence is available, it indicates that the harem was much more likely to be monogamous. For example, in late Ottoman Istanbul, only 2.29 percent of married men were polygynous, with the average number of wives being 2.08. In some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, prevalence of women in agricultural work leads to wider practice of polygyny, but makes seclusion impractical. In contrast, in Eurasian and North African rural communities that rely on male-dominated plough farming, seclusion is economically possible but polygyny is undesirable. This indicates that the fundamental characteristic of the harem is seclusion of women rather than polygyny.\n\nThe idea of the harem or seclusion of women did not originate with Muhammad or Islam. The practice of secluding women was common to many Ancient Near East communities, especially where polygamy was permitted. In pre-Islamic Assyria, Persia, and Egypt, most royal courts had a harem, where the ruler’s wives and concubines lived with female attendants, and eunuchs. \"Encyclopædia Iranica\" uses the term \"harem\" to describe the practices of the ancient Near East.\n\nIn Assyria, rules of harem etiquette were stipulated by royal edicts. The women of the harem lived in seclusion, guarded by eunuchs, and the entire harem traveled together with the king. A number of regulations were designed to prevent disputes among the women from developing into political intrigues.\n\nFemale seclusion and a special part of the house reserved for women were common among the elites of ancient Greece (where it was known as the gynaeceum). These traditions were taken up in the Byzantine empire, though the rigid norms of seclusion expressed in Byzantine literature did not necessarily reflect actual practice.\n\nThere is no evidence of harem practices among early Iranians, but Iranian dynasties adopted them after their conquests in the Middle East. According to Greek sources, the nobility of the Medes kept no less than five wives who were watched over by eunuchs. Greek historians report that Persian notables of the Achaemenid empire as well as the king himself had several wives and a larger number of concubines. The Old Persian word for the harem is not attested, but it can be reconstructed as \"xšapā.stāna\" (lit. night station or place where one spends the night). The chief consort, who was usually the mother of the heir to the throne, was in charge of the household. She had her own living quarters, revenues, and a large staff. Three other groups of women lived in separate quarters: the other legal wives, royal princesses, and concubines. The Achaemenid harem served as a model for later Iranian empires, and the institution remained almost unchanged. Little is known about the harems of the Parthians, but the information about the Sasanian harem reveals a picture that closely mirrors Achaemenid customs. A peculiar characteristic of the Sasanian royalty and aristocracy, which was attested in later times under the Safavid and Qajar empires, was that the highest female rank was not necessarily given to the chief wife, but could be held by a daughter or a sister.\n\nAccording to Sasanian legend, of all the Persian kings, Khosrow II was the most extravagant in his hedonism. He searched his realm to find the most beautiful girls, and it was rumored that about 3,000 of them were kept in his harem. This practice was widely condemned and it was counted as one of the crimes for which he was later tried and executed. Khosrow himself claimed that he sent his favorite wife Shirin every year to offer them a possibility of leaving his harem with a dowry for marriage, but that their luxurious lifestyle always prompted them to refuse his offer.\n\nSouth Asian traditions of female seclusion, called \"purdah\", may have been influenced by Islamic customs, but the practice of segregation by gender in Hindu society predates the Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent. Ashoka, the great emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty in India, kept a harem of around 500 women. Once when a few of the women insulted him, he had all of them burnt to death.\n\nThe harem system first became fully institutionalized in the Islamic world under the Abbasid caliphate. Seclusion of women was established in various communities of the Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and Persia before the advent of Islam, and some scholars believe that Muslims adopted the custom from the Byzantine Empire and Persia, retrospectively interpreting the Quran to justify it. Although the term \"harem\" does not denote women's quarters in the Quran, a number of Quranic verses discussing modesty and seclusion were held up by Quranic commentators as religious rationale for the separation of women from men, including the so-called \"hijab verse\" (33:53). In modern usage \"hijab\" colloquially refers to the religious attire worn by Muslim women, but in this verse it meant \"veil\" or \"curtain\" that physically separates female from male space. Although classical commentators agreed that the verse spoke about a curtain separating the living quarters of Muhammad's wives from visitors to his house, they usually viewed this practice as providing a model for all Muslim women.\n\nIn contrast to the earlier era of the Prophet Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate, women in Umayyad and Abbasid society were absent from all arenas of the community's central affairs. While their early Muslim forbearers led men into battle, started rebellions, and played an active role in community life, as demonstrated in the Hadith literature, Abbasid women were ideally kept in seclusion. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children, many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated Sassanian upper classes. In the wake of the conquests an elite man could potentially own a thousand slaves, and ordinary soldiers could have ten people serving them.\n\nNabia Abbott, preeminent historian of elite women of the Abbasid Caliphate, describes the lives of harem women as follows.\nThe choicest women were imprisoned behind heavy curtains and locked doors, the strings and keys of which were entrusted into the hands of that pitiable creature – the eunuch. As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.\n\nThe marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves. Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.\n\nElite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:\n\nEven so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry. Enough survives to give us access to women's historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, such as the Sufi mystic Raabi'a al-Adwiyya (714–801 CE), the princess and poet 'Ulayya bint al-Mahdi (777–825 CE), and the singing-girls Shāriyah (–70 CE), Fadl Ashsha'ira (d. 871 CE) and Arib al-Ma'muniyya (797–890 CE).\n\nThe Imperial Harem of the Ottoman sultan, which was also called \"seraglio\" in the West, was part of Topkapı Palace. It also housed the Valide Sultan, as well as the sultan's daughters and other female relatives. Eunuchs and servant girls were also part of the harem. During the later periods, the sons of the sultan lived in the Harem until they were 12 years old.\n\nIt is being more commonly acknowledged today that the purpose of harems during the Ottoman Empire was for the royal upbringing of the future wives of noble and royal men. These women would be educated so that they were able to appear in public as a royal wife.\n\nSome women of Ottoman harem, especially wives, mothers and sisters of sultans, played very important political roles in Ottoman history, and in times it was said that the empire was ruled from harem. This period of Ottoman history is known as the Sultanate of Women. Hürrem Sultan (wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, mother of Selim II), was one of the most powerful women in Ottoman history, and wielded vast political power. The title of Haseki Sultan, was created for her and was used by her successors.\n\nKösem Sultan was also one of the most powerful women in Ottoman history. Kösem Sultan achieved power and influenced the politics of the Ottoman Empire when she became Haseki Sultan as favourite consort and later legal wife of Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603–1617) and Valide Sultan as mother of Murad IV (r. 1623–1640) and Ibrahim (r. 1640–1648), and grandmother of Mehmed IV (r. 1648–1687).\n\nKösem's son, Sultan Ibrahim the Mad, Ottoman ruler from 1640 to 1648, is said to have drowned 280 concubines of his harem in the Bosphorus. At least one of his concubines, Turhan Sultan, a Rus' girl (from the area around modern Ukraine) who came into the Ottoman empire as a slave sold by Nogai slavers, survived his reign.\n\nIn Istanbul, the separation of men's and women's quarters was never practiced among the poor, and by 1920s and 1930s it had become a thing of the past in middle and upper-class homes.\n\nThe king's wives, concubines, dancing girls and slaves were not the only women of the Mughal harem. Many others, including the king's mother lived in the harem. Aunts, grandmothers, sisters, daughters and other female relatives of the king all lived in the harem. Male children also lived in the harem until they grew up. Within the precincts of the harem were markets, bazaars, laundries, kitchens, playgrounds, schools and baths. The harem had a hierarchy, its chief authorities being the wives and female relatives of the emperor and below them were the concubines.\n\nUrdubegis were the class of women assigned to protect the emperor and inhabitants of the zenana. Because the women of the Mughal court lived sequestered under purdah, the administration of their living quarters was run entirely by women. The division of the administrative tasks was dictated largely by the vision of Akbar, who organized his zenana of over 5,000 noble women and servants. The women tasked with the protection of the zenana were commonly of Habshi, Tatar, Turk and Kashmiri origin. Kashmiri women were selected because they did not observe purdah. Many of the women were purchased as slaves, and trained for their positions.\n\nThe women of the Mughal harem could exercise enormous political power. Nur Jahan, chief consort of Jahangir, was the most powerful and influential woman at court during a period when the Mughal Empire was at the peak of its power and glory. More decisive and proactive than her husband, she is considered by historians to have been the real power behind the throne for more than fifteen years. Nur Jahan was granted certain honours and privileges which were never enjoyed by any Mughal empress before or after. Nur Jahan was the only Mughal empress to have coinage struck in her name. She was often present when the Emperor held court, and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell. She was given charge of his imperial seal, implying that her perusal and consent were necessary before any document or order received legal validity. The Emperor sought her views on most matters before issuing orders. The only other Mughal empress to command such devotion from her husband was Nur Jahan's niece Mumtaz Mahal, for whom Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum. However, Mumtaz took no interest in affairs of state and Nur Jahan is therefore unique in the annals of the Mughal Empire for the political influence she wielded.\n\nThe royal harem played an important role in the history of Safavid Persia. In the early Safavid period, young princes were placed in the care of a \"lala\" (high-ranking Qizilbash chief who acted as a guardian) and eventually given charge of important governorates. Although this system had the danger of encouraging regional rebellions against the shah, it gave the princes education and training which prepared them for dynastic succession. This policy was changed by Shah Abbas I (1571-1629), who \"largely banished\" the princes to the harem, where their social interactions were limited to the ladies of the harem and eunuchs. This deprived them of administrative and military training as well as experience of dealing with the aristocracy of the realm, which, together with the princes' indulgent upbringing, made them not only unprepared to carry out royal responsibilities, but often also uninterested in doing so. The confinement of royal princes to the harem was an important factor contributing to the decline of the Safavid dynasty.\n\nThe administration of the royal harem constituted an independent branch of the court, staffed mainly by eunuchs. These were initially black eunuchs, but white eunuchs from Georgia also began to be employed from the time of Abbas I. The mothers of rival princes together with eunuchs engaged in palace intrigues in an attempt to place their candidate on the throne. From the middle of the sixteenth century, rivalries between Georgian and Circassian women in the royal harem gave rise to dynastic struggles of an ethnic nature previously unknown at the court. When Shah Abbas II died in 1666, palace eunuchs engineered the succession of Suleiman I and effectively seized control of the state. Suleiman set up a privy council, which included the most important eunuchs, in the harem, thereby depriving traditional state institutions of their functions. The eunuchs' influence over military and civil affairs was checked only by their internal rivalries and the religious movement led by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi. The royal harem reached such proportions under Sultan Husayn (1668–1726) that it consumed a large part of state revenues. After the fall of the Safavid dynasty, which occurred soon afterwards, eunuchs were never again able to achieve significant political influence as a class in Persia.\n\nMoulay Ismail, Alaouite sultan of Morocco from 1672 to 1727, had over 500 concubines. He is said to have fathered a total of 525 sons and 342 daughters by 1703 and achieved a 700th son in 1721.\n\nThe practice of female seclusion witnessed a sharp decline in the early 20th century as a result of education and increased economic opportunity for women, as well as Western influences, but it is still practiced in some parts of the world, such as rural Afghanistan and conservative states of the Persian Gulf region. Since the early 1980s, a rise in conservative Islamic currents has led to a greater emphasis on traditional notions of modesty and gender segregation, with some radical preachers in Saudi Arabia calling for a return to seclusion of women and an end of female employment. Many working women in conservative societies have adopted hijab as a way of coping with a social environment where men are uncomfortable interacting with women in the public space. Some religious women have tried to emulate seclusion practices abandoned by their grandmothers' generation in an effort to affirm traditional religious values in the face of pervasive Westernization.\n\nEunuchs were probably introduced into Islam through the influence of Persian and Byzantine imperial courts. The Ottomans employed eunuchs as guardians of the harem. Istanbul's Topkapı Palace housed several hundred eunuchs in the late-sixteenth century. The head eunuch who guarded the entrance of the harem was known as \"kızlar ağası.\" Eunuchs were either Nilotic slaves captured in the Nile vicinity and transported through ports in Upper Egypt, the Sudan and Abyssinia, or European slaves such as Slavs and Franks.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia of Islam, castration was prohibited in Islamic law \"by a sort of tacit consensus\" and eunuchs were acquired from Christian and Jewish traders. Al-Muqaddasi identifies a town in Spain where the operation was performed by Jews and the survivors were then sent overseas. Encyclopedia Judaica states that Talmudic law counts castration among mutilations entitling a slave to immediate release, so that the ability of Jewish slave traders to supply eunuchs to harems depended on whether they could acquire castrated males.\n\nThe dark eunuch was held as the embodiment of the sensual tyranny that held sway in the fantasized Ottoman palace, for he had been \"clipped\" or \"completely sheared\" to make of him the \"ultimate slave\" for the supreme ruler. In the Ottoman court, white eunuchs, who were mostly brought from castration centers in Christian Europe and Circassia, were responsible for much of the palace administration, while black eunuchs, who had undergone a more radical form of castration, were the only male slaves employed in the royal harem.\n\nThe chief black eunuch, or the Kizlar Agha, came to acquire a great deal of power within the Ottoman Empire. He not only managed every aspect of the Harem women's lives but was also responsible for the education and social etiquette of the princes and young women in the Harem. He arranged for all ceremonial events within the Harem including weddings and circumcision parties, and even notified women of death sentences when \"accused of crimes or implicated in intrigues of jealousy and corruption.\"\n\nNineteenth-century travelers accounts tell of being served by black eunuch slaves. The trade was suppressed in the Ottoman Empire beginning in the mid-19th century, and slavery was legally abolished in 1887 or 1888. Late 19th-century slaves in Palestine included enslaved Africans and the sold daughters of poor Palestinian peasants. Both Arabs and Jews owned slaves. Circassians and Abazins from North of the Black Sea may have also be involved in the Ottoman slave trade.\n\nIn Muscovite Russia the area of aristocratic houses where women were secluded was known as \"terem\".\n\nIn Mexico, Aztec ruler Montezuma II, who met Cortes, kept 4,000 concubines; every member of the Aztec nobility was supposed to have had as many consorts as he could afford.\n\n\"Harem\" is also the usual English translation of the Chinese language term \"hougong\" (\"hou-kung\"; ), in reference to the Imperial Chinese Harem. \"Hougong\" refers to the large palaces for the Chinese emperor's consorts, concubines, female attendants and eunuchs. The women who lived in an emperor's \"hougong\" sometimes numbered in the thousands. In 1421, Yongle Emperor ordered 2,800 concubines, servant girls and eunuchs who guarded them to a slow slicing death as the Emperor tried to suppress a sex scandal which threatened to humiliate him.\n\nIn Africa, many chieftains have traditionally had harems. The Zulu king currently has six wives, for example, and members of the \nNigerian chieftaincy system have historically had as many as three hundred of them.\n\nA distinct, imaginary vision of the harem emerged in the West starting from the 17th century, when Europeans became aware of Muslim harems housing numerous women. In contrast to the medieval European views, which conceived Muslim women as victimized but powerful through their charms and deceit, during the era of European colonialism the \"imaginary harem\" came to represent what Orientalist scholars saw as an abased and subjugated status of women in the Islamic civilization. These notions served to cast the West as culturally superior and justify the colonial enterprise. Under the influence of The Thousand and One Nights, the harem was often conceived as a personal brothel, where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses, directing their strong but oppressed sexuality toward a single man in a form of \"competitive lust\".\n\nA centuries-old theme in Western culture is the depiction of European women forcibly taken into Oriental harems—evident for example in the Mozart opera \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\") concerning the attempt of the hero Belmonte to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the \"seraglio\"/harem of the Pasha Selim; or in Voltaire's \"Candide\", in chapter 12 of which the old woman relates her experiences of being sold into harems across the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMuch of Verdi's opera \"Il corsaro\" takes place in the harem of the Pasha Seid—where Gulnara, the Pasha's favorite, chafes at life in the harem, and longs for freedom and true love. Eventually she falls in love with the dashing invading corsair Corrado, kills the Pasha and escapes with the corsair—only to discover that he loves another woman.\n\n\"The Lustful Turk\", a well-known British erotic novel, was also based on the theme of Western women forced into sexual slavery in the harem of the Dey of Algiers, while in \"A Night in a Moorish Harem\", a Western man is invited into a harem and engages in forbidden sex with nine concubines. In both works, the theme of \"West vs. Orient\" is clearly interwoven with the sexual themes.\n\nThe Sheik novel and the Sheik film, a Hollywood production from 1921, are both controversial and probably the best known works created by exploiting the motif. Much criticism ensued over decades, especially recently, on various strong and unambiguous Orientalist and colonialist elements, and in particularly directed at ideas closely related to the central rape plot in which for women, sexual submission is a necessary and natural condition, and that interracial love between an Englishwoman and Arab, a \"native\", is avoided, while the rape is ultimately justified by having the rapist turn out to be European rather than Arab.\n\nMany Western artists have depicted their imaginary conceptions of the harem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1991323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991323", "title": "Too Close for Comfort", "text": "Too Close for Comfort\n\nToo Close for Comfort is an American sitcom television series that aired on ABC from November 11, 1980, to May 5, 1983, and in first-run syndication from April 7, 1984, to February 7, 1987. Its name was changed to The Ted Knight Show when the show was retooled for what would turn out to be its final season.\n\nTed Knight and Nancy Dussault star as Henry and Muriel Rush, respectively; owners of a two-family house in San Francisco, California. Henry is a conservative cartoonist who authors a comic strip called \"Cosmic Cow.\" During scenes in which Henry draws in his bedroom, Knight used his earlier acquired ventriloquism talents for comical conversations with a hand-puppet version of \"Cosmic Cow.\" Muriel is a laid back freelance photographer, having been a lead singer of a band in her earlier days. They have two grown children, older daughter, brunette Jackie (Deborah Van Valkenburgh) who works for a bank and younger daughter Sara (Lydia Cornell), a blonde bombshell and a college student at San Francisco State University.\n\nAt the start of the premiere episode, Jackie and Sara are living with their parents in a cramped, awkward arrangement. Their longtime downstairs tenant, Myron (later called Neville) Rafkin, recently died. The family discovers Rafkin was a transvestite and the many strange women Henry had been opening the door for all those years were actually Rafkin himself. Jackie and Sara convince their parents to allow them to move into the now-vacant downstairs apartment. In a running gag, Henry falls off the girls' ultra-modern chairs or couch every time he attempts to sit down. Despite the daughters' push for independence and moving into the downstairs apartment, Henry proves to be a very protective father and constantly meddles in their affairs.\n\nDue to an actors' strike led by the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, new programming for the fall 1980 season was pushed back several months. As a result, \"Too Close for Comfort\" did not debut until November 11, 1980, and its initial season consisted of 19 episodes. The show garnered high ratings, benefiting from its placement in ABC's powerhouse Tuesday night lineup following hits like \"Happy Days,\" \"Laverne & Shirley\" and \"Three's Company.\" Both the latter series and this series were recorded in the same studio, CBS Television City in Los Angeles, during \"Too Close for Comfort\"'s ABC years.\n\nA few episodes into the series, Sara's addle-headed friend Monroe Ficus, played by actor Jim J. Bullock, made an appearance. Although he was originally intended to be used for only a single episode, producers added the character to the series. Monroe was introduced to Henry by Sara as a depressed, lonely fellow student and street musician. Although Sara (with help from Jackie) tried to help him and send him on his way, Monroe found himself getting woven into the entire family's affairs and he became just a \"friend\" of Sara's and Henry's principal (if unintended) foil. During the first two seasons, Selma Diamond made guest appearances as Mildred Rafkin, sister of the late Myron. Sardonic, deadpan Mildred initially showed up to collect belongings left by Myron/Neville in the downstairs apartment, but continued to visit thereafter. Seemingly, there were sentimental reasons, but occasionally she would attempt to make time with the much younger Monroe, with whom she was infatuated.\n\nAlso added in early 1981 was Arthur Wainwright (Hamilton Camp), Henry's boss and head of Wainwright Publishing, who nearly decided to force the veteran cartoonist and \"Cosmic Cow\" into retirement in order to maintain a youth-oriented staff. The short-statured Mr. Wainwright, who spoke with Shakespearean diction and fancied himself an amateur detective (as a result of the famous mystery novels his company published), eventually let Henry stay with the firm, after the latter proved adept in helping him solve the mystery of Sara's stolen purse. Wainwright no longer appeared in person after the first season, but was referred to. Later, at the start of the fifth season, Graham Jarvis began appearing as Wainwright in a few guest appearances.\n\nDuring its second season, the series' principal stories are focused around Muriel's pregnancy. Additionally, Henry's niece April (Deena Freeman) comes from Delaware to live with the Rush family. The season concludes with Muriel giving birth to a son, Andrew (later played regularly by twins William and Michael Cannon from 1983 to 1984).\n\nFor the third season, April departs and the character of Muriel's mother, Iris Martin (Audrey Meadows) is added in order to help take care of Andrew. Also that fall, Jackie becomes engaged to her steady boyfriend, police officer Brad Turner (played by Gary Dontzig in one episode and by Jordan Suffin thereafter), but they broke it off after a short time. Jackie eventually moved into the field of fashion design, taking courses and producing her own clothing templates, which she later had produced as \"The Jacqueline Rush Collection.\" Sara, meanwhile, decided to major in communications and, while continuing her studies, became a weather girl for a time at a major San Francisco TV station. Monroe seemed to be detached from Sara's circle of friends, but was taking the same major as her and became a security guard around campus.\n\nThe character of Henry Rush became famous for wearing sweatshirts from various American colleges and universities. It was revealed in one episode that he wore the different sweatshirts because he himself had never gone to college. Eventually fans would send in sweatshirts from universities around the country hoping they would be used during taping.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, ABC moved the series to Thursday nights, which proved to be disastrous. Paired with failures such as \"Joanie Loves Chachi,\" \"Star of the Family\" and \"It Takes Two,\" \"Too Close For Comfort\" saw its ratings fall drastically. At the conclusion of the season, the network cancelled the series, after dropping from #6 the previous season to #38. ABC broadcast the last first-run episode broadcast on May 5, 1983, as a pilot for a proposed spin-off series called \"Family Business\". The series was to have focused on the misadventures of Lucille Garabaldi (Lainie Kazan) and her two sons (played by George Deloy and Jimmy Baio) as they tried to run a construction business. Hillary Bailey Smith was also featured in this backdoor pilot as the new, attractive female foreman that Lucille hired for her sons.\n\nABC aired reruns of \"Too Close for Comfort\" at 11:00 am ET from June 27 to September 23, 1983.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, TV station owner Metromedia was expanding its portfolio of original syndicated programming through its production subsidiary, Metromedia Producers Corporation. Its efforts would eventually lead to the creation of the Fox Broadcasting Company. When \"Too Close for Comfort\" was canceled by ABC, Metromedia Producers Corporation elected to pick up the series and began producing all-new episodes to run on various stations throughout the country.\n\nStarting in April 1984, a total of 23 new episodes were broadcast for the show's fourth season, featuring the same cast as seen on the ABC episodes. Monroe and Iris were still around to bother Henry (although Meadows had cut back her involvement to guest shots only, so her character moves back to Chicago in the season premiere) and Jackie and Sara were still downstairs. The girls continued to advance in the respective career paths; Sara auditioned for a news anchor position at the TV station, but was passed over in favor of a female candidate who may have not had Sara's looks, but had greater experience in hard news. This caused Sara to learn the valuable lesson that her sex appeal alone would not get her everywhere. Monroe eventually moves into a remodeled attic, with the entrance from the Rushes' kitchen. Henry agreed to have Monroe as a tenant in a fleeting moment of compassion, but Monroe still proved to be a constant annoyance to him.\n\nThe show's ratings improved in syndication and Metromedia ordered an additional 30 episodes, airing through November 1985. When the fifth season began, a single child actor, Joshua Goodwin, took over the role of Andrew Rush (which he would hold for the remainder of the series). Henry was now working out of his own fancy office at Wainwright Publishing, as a result of toddler Andrew's \"terrible twos\" behavior interfering with his concentration at home. Everyone else's worldly or, in the case of Monroe, wacky affairs were also proving to be an intense distraction, considering they were all living under the same roof. Near the end of the season, Jackie accepted a job offer in Italy that would help further her clothing line, with her family and friends giving her a big send-off. With a total of 107 episodes of \"Too Close for Comfort\" having been produced, the show became a popular staple for syndicated reruns throughout the late 1980s.\n\nIn late 1985, several changes were made before further episodes were produced. The show's title was changed to \"The Ted Knight Show\" (not to be confused with the short-lived 1978 CBS show of the same name; hence it was occasionally referred to as \"The New Ted Knight Show\", such as when Jim J. Bullock made a guest appearance on \"Break the Bank\") and the setting was changed to Marin County, north of San Francisco. A new arrangement of Johnny Mandel's theme song was recorded, and a new opening title sequence was shot in the surrounding area. Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Lydia Cornell, and Audrey Meadows left the cast (Meadows would make one guest appearance this season). Veteran actress Pat Carroll, as well as Lisa Antille were added to the cast along with returning Nancy Dussault, and Jim J. Bullock.\n\nThe Rushes had moved to a larger house near Mill Valley. Henry retired from cartooning and became editor of the \"Marin Bugler\", a local newspaper. Henry purchased a 49% stake in the publication from Hope Stinson (Carroll), who retained the other 51% and proved to be a thorn in his side. Muriel began working as the paper's staff photographer. Monroe, now living in his own apartment, visited frequently, and worked as a reporter-in-training at the \"Bugler\". The Rushes hired a live-in nanny/housekeeper, a young woman named Lisa Flores (Antille), who would later become involved with Monroe.

Twenty-two episodes were produced prior to the summer of 1986 and twelve had aired by mid-July. The revamped show continued to be successful and was scheduled to resume production for another season but Ted Knight, who had been battling colon cancer since 1985, died on August 26, 1986 at the age of 62 and no further episodes would be produced. The ten remaining first-run episodes were broadcast from September 1986 to February 1987.\n\nWhen the episodes of \"The Ted Knight Show\" were added to the rerun package of \"Too Close for Comfort\", the original show's title graphic was used, but the updated opening theme and sequence remained unchanged.\n\n\n\nThe show entered daily broadcast syndication in the fall of 1986, which continued until 2003. The syndication rights for \"Too Close for Comfort\" are held by DLT Entertainment, a production and distribution company owned by show producer D.L. Taffner.\n\nReruns of the series aired on TBS. The series later aired on TV Land from 2003 to 2006. The series also aired on Antenna TV from January 2011 to September 2012. In 2018, it began airing on Logo.\n\nRhino Entertainment Company (under its \"Rhino Retrovision\" classic TV entertainment brand) released the first two seasons of \"Too Close for Comfort\" on DVD in Region 1 in 2004/2005. However, Rhino did not obtain the original, uncut versions of the episodes for the Season 1 release and instead used the versions edited for syndication (like those seen on Nickelodeon's sister networks, Nick at Nite and TV Land), which are missing several minutes of footage, including the final scene of each episode before the closing credits.

It debuted at the 2004 contest and participated every year until the 2009 contest. A majority of the competing songs were sung in Catalan, the national language of Andorra. Interest in the contest had been great for some time before 2004, despite the local Andorran broadcaster, Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra (RTVA), not airing the contest until the early 2000s. Previously, citizens could watch it on either Spanish or French stations.\n\nAs of 2020, Andorra is the only country to have participated in the contest without reaching the final. The best the country has ever done was in the 2007 contest, where it finished 12th in its semi-final and did not advance to the final.\n\nDespite its interest in the competition, Andorra has never qualified for the final. In 2007, a qualification was predicted, but with a 12th place finish, it just missed out. In the past, RTVA held a large reality show contest titled \"12 Punts\" to select its entry for Eurovision. From 2006 through 2008, RTVA held an internal selection process to select the Andorran entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. For 2009, RTVA announced that there would be a public selection process to select the entry - something not seen in the country since 2005. Andorra sent the song \"La teva decisió (Get a Life)\" performed by Susanne Georgi to the 2009 contest in Moscow, Russia. Like those before it, the entry also failed to qualify for the final, receiving only 8 points in the semi-final.\n\nIn December 2009, RTVA announced that Andorra would not participate in the 2010 Contest due to a lack of funding for an Andorran entry. This came after RTVA had already submitted an application for the contest in case funding could be found to submit an entry. The country did not return to the 2011 contest due to financial difficulties.. On 8 November 2011, RTVA announced that they would leave the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), due to financial reasons and a cut of subsidies from the Andorran government. After a meeting with the EBU director Ingrid Deltenre in June 2012, RTVA decided to stay in the EBU, but said participation in Eurovision is still unlikely. In November 2019, the Andorran Government confirmed to \"El Nacional\" that RTVA could return to the contest after an assessment of the cost was made. However, they did not specify whether that return would happen at the contest in Rotterdam, or at a future contest.\n\nThe \"Barbara Dex Award\" is an annually awarded, fan-voted accolade for the \"worst dressed\" artists in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n"}

{"id": "1991352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991352", "title": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates", "text": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates\n\nPolyhydroxyalkanoates or PHAs are polyesters produced in nature by numerous microorganisms, including through bacterial fermentation of sugars or lipids. When produced by bacteria they serve as both a source of energy and as a carbon store. More than 150 different monomers can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties. These plastics are biodegradable and are used in the production of bioplastics.\n\nThey can be either thermoplastic or elastomeric materials, with melting points ranging from 40 to 180 °C.\n\nThe mechanical properties and biocompatibility of PHA can also be changed by blending, modifying the surface or combining PHA with other polymers, enzymes and inorganic materials, making it possible for a wider range of applications.\n\nTo produce PHA, a culture of a micro-organism such as \"Cupriavidus necator\" is placed in a suitable medium and fed appropriate nutrients so that it multiplies rapidly. Once the population has reached a substantial level, the nutrient composition is changed to force the micro-organism to synthesize PHA. The yield of PHA obtained from the intracellular granule inclusions can be as high as 80% of the organism's dry weight.\n\nThe biosynthesis of PHA is usually caused by certain deficiency conditions (e.g. lack of macro elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, trace elements, or lack of oxygen) and the excess supply of carbon sources.\n\nPolyesters are deposited in the form of highly refractive granules in the cells. Depending upon the microorganism and the cultivation conditions, homo- or copolyesters with different hydroxyalkanic acids are generated. PHA granules are then recovered by disrupting the cells. Recombinant \"Bacillus subtilis\" str. pBE2C1 and \"Bacillus subtilis\" str. pBE2C1AB were used in production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and it was shown that they could use malt waste as carbon source for lower cost of PHA production.\n\nPHA synthases are the key enzymes of PHA biosynthesis. They use the coenzyme A - thioester of (r)-hydroxy fatty acids as substrates. The two classes of PHA synthases differ in the specific use of hydroxy fatty acids of short or medium chain length.\n\nThe resulting PHA is of the two types:\n\n\nA few bacteria, including \"Aeromonas hydrophila\" and \"Thiococcus pfennigii\", synthesize copolyester from the above two types of hydroxy fatty acids, or at least possess enzymes that are capable of part of this synthesis.\n\nAnother even larger scale synthesis can be done with the help of soil organisms. For lack of nitrogen and phosphorus they produce a kilogram of PHA per three kilograms of sugar.\n\nThe simplest and most commonly occurring form of PHA is the fermentative production of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, P3HB), which consists of 1000 to 30000 hydroxy fatty acid monomers.\n\nIn the industrial production of PHA, the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions of microbial fermentation of sugar, glucose, or vegetable oil.\n\nIn the 1980s, Imperial Chemical Industries developed poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-\"co\"-3-hydroxyvalerate) obtained via fermentation that was named \"Biopol\". It was sold under the name \"Biopol\" and distributed in the U.S. by Monsanto and later Metabolix.\n\nAs raw material for the fermentation, carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose can be used, but also vegetable oil or glycerine from biodiesel production. Researchers in industry are working on methods with which transgenic crops will be developed that express PHA synthesis routes from bacteria and so produce PHA as energy storage in their tissues. Several companies are working to develop methods of producing PHA from waste water, including start-up Micromidas and Veolia subsidiary Anoxkaldnes.\n\nPHAs are processed mainly via injection molding, extrusion and extrusion bubbles into films and hollow bodies.\n\nPHA polymers are thermoplastic, can be processed on conventional processing equipment, and are, depending on their composition, ductile and more or less elastic. They differ in their properties according to their chemical composition (homo-or copolyester, contained hydroxy fatty acids).\n\nThey are UV stable, in contrast to other bioplastics from polymers such as polylactic acid, partial ca. temperatures up to , and show a low permeation of water. The crystallinity can lie in the range of a few to 70%. Processability, impact strength and flexibility improves with a higher percentage of valerate in the material. PHAs are soluble in halogenated solvents such chloroform, dichloromethane or dichloroethane.\n\nPHB is similar in its material properties to polypropylene (PP), has a good resistance to moisture and aroma barrier properties. Polyhydroxybutyric acid synthesized from pure PHB is relatively brittle and stiff. PHB copolymers, which may include other fatty acids such as beta-hydroxyvaleric acid, may be elastic.\n\nDue to its biodegradability and potential to create bioplastics with novel properties, much interest exists to develop the use of PHA-based materials. PHA fits into the green economy as a means to create plastics from non-fossil fuel sources. Furthermore, active research is being carried out for the biotransformation \"upcycling\" of plastic waste (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane) into PHA using \"Pseudomonas putida\" bacteria.\n\nA PHA copolymer called PHBV (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)) is less stiff and tougher, and it may be used as packaging material.\n\nIn June 2005, a US company (Metabolix, Inc.) received the US Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award (small business category) for their development and commercialisation of a cost-effective method for manufacturing PHAs.\n\nThere are potential applications for PHA produced by micro-organisms within the agricultural, medical and pharmaceutical industries, primarily due to their biodegradability.\n\nFixation and orthopaedic applications have included sutures, suture fasteners, meniscus repair devices, rivets, tacks, staples, screws (including interference screws), bone plates and bone plating systems, surgical mesh, repair patches, slings, cardiovascular patches, orthopedic pins (including bone.lling augmentation material), adhesion barriers, stents, guided tissue repair/regeneration devices, articular cartilage repair devices, nerve guides, tendon repair devices, atrial septal defect repair devices, pericardial patches, bulking and filling agents, vein valves, bone marrow scaffolds, meniscus regeneration devices, ligament and tendon grafts, ocular cell implants, spinal fusion cages, skin substitutes, dural substitutes, bone graft substitutes, bone dowels, wound dressings, and hemostats.\n\n"}

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Szydłów. It lies approximately west of Staszów and south-east of the regional capital Kielce. The village has a population of 1,093.\n\nSzydłów's history dates to the 12th century. It gained its city rights in 1329 and lost them in 1869. The village several tourist attractions, including the 16th-century Szydłów Synagogue, several buildings and churches dating to the 14th century and the ruins of a castle from the same period. The first official inventory of important buildings in Poland, \"A General View of the Nature of Ancient Monuments in the Kingdom of Poland,\" led by Kazimierz Stronczyński from 1844–55, describes the Szydłów Synagogue as one of Poland's architecturally notable buildings.\n\nSzydłów is located in Lesser Polish Upland, between the Świętokrzyskie Mountains and the \"Połaniec Plain\". The village lies within borders of \"Chmielnik–Szydłów Protected Landscape Area\". The distance to Kielce is 40 kilometers, to Staszów 12 kilometers. Due to numerous plum orchards, the village is called \"Plum Capital of Poland\". Every year, the \"Plum Festival\" takes place here. The village is crossed by two regional roads—765th and 756th; furthermore, Szydłów is a stop along Lesser Polish Way.\n\nFirst mention of Szydłów comes from the year 1191, in documents of Sandomierz Collegiate church. At that time, the village was owned by Polish Kings, located along the Vistula merchant road, which was of major importance in the late Middle Ages. On July 1, 1329, Szydłów was incorporated as a town on Środa Śląska town law (see also: Magdeburg rights).\n\nIn the mid-14th century, King Casimir III the Great founded here a fortified castle and the \"Church of Saint Ladislaus\". The town was surrounded by a defensive wall, with three gates—Kraków Gate, Opatów Gate, and Water Gate. Soon afterwards, Szydłów became the seat of a starosta, and first artisans came here, as well as Jewish settlers. The town was located in Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship, and its location helped wine, cattle and hops merchants, who would go with their goods to Sandomierz. In the 16th century, Szydłów emerged as a center of cloth-making. Also, tailors, bakers, shoemakers, iron smiths, saddle makers, sword makers and pot makers worked here, there also was a brewery. In 1528, waterworks and bath houses were opened, and in 1564, the town had 180 houses, of which 49 were located on the market square, but next year, large parts of Szydłów burned in a fire. At that time, a number Jews settled in the town, who in 1534–1564 built first synagogue.\n\nGood times came to an end in the first half of the 17th century. In 1630 Szydłów was burned by rebellious soldiers of fortune, who were not paid their salaries. Unable to enter the fortified town, the mercenaries set the suburbs on fire, and the blaze reached Szydłów. Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660), and the invasion of troops of George II Rakoczi (see Treaty of Radnot) brought almost complete destruction, after which town's population shrank from 1,300 to 350, and the number of houses was reduced to 54 (as for 1663). After these conflicts, Szydłów never recovered to its previous prosperity. In 1789, Szydłów had a stone town hall, 5 mills on the Ciekąca river and 196 houses, many of them abandoned. The castle was ruined, and by 1827, the number of houses grew to 202, and the population reached 1,550.\n\nAfter the third partition of Poland (1795), Szydłów was annexed by the Austrian Empire, but in 1809 it became the seat of a county in the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it became part of Congress Poland, and in 1850, Russian authorities liquidated Szydłów County, merging it with Stopnica County. In 1869, as a punishment for participation of residents in the January Uprising, Szydłów was reduced to the status of a village.\n\nIn 1929 Szydłów, already part of Kielce Voivodeship, had 2,246 inhabitants, of which 30% were Jews. During World War II, Germans opened a ghetto here, and the village itself was partly destroyed. In 1960 the population was 1,402.\n\nOn 1 January 2019, Szydłów regained its town status.\n\n\nAccording to the 2002 Poland census, there were 1,054 people residing in Szydłów village, of whom 50.7% were male and 49.3% were female. In the village, the population was spread out with 23.6% under the age of 18, 37.4% from 18 to 44, 20.5% from 45 to 64, and 18.5% who were 65 years of age or older.\n\n"}

I have always believed that innuendoes should be justified before they are made, either by me and the Congress, or even in the press.\" A commentary in the May, 1985 edition of \"Proceedings\" magazine exonerates Korth for any improprieties relating to the awarding of TFX.\n\nWhen he was not serving in the above public or private sector capacities, Fred Korth was a lawyer in private practice. One of his better known cases was a small one heard June 24, 1948 in the County of Tarrant, Texas, when his client, Edwin A. Ekdahl, was officially divorced from Marguerite Frances Claverie Ekdahl (also known as Marguerite Oswald), whose son from a previous marriage was Lee Harvey Oswald. Following the end of Korth's first marriage in 1964, he began a romantic relationship with heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, daughter of breakfast-cereal magnate C. W.

Schrock characterized several metallacyclobutadiene complexes that were catalytically active. \n\nIn 2001, Alois Fürstner reported a new molybdenum catalyst replacing alkoxide with aniline-derived ligands.\n\nThe Schrock catalyst is tris(\"t\"-butoxy)(2,2-dimethylpropylidyne)tungsten(VI). Commercially available, it is prepared from W(NMe), which undergoes alcoholysis with \"tert\"-butanol. \n\nAlkyne metathesis can be used in ring-closing operations and RCAM stands for ring closing alkyne metathesis. The olfactory molecule civetone can be synthesised from a di-alkyne. After ring closure the new triple bond is stereoselectively reduced with hydrogen and the Lindlar catalyst in order to obtain the \"Z\"-alkene (cyclic \"E\"-alkenes are available through the Birch reduction). An important driving force for this type of reaction is the expulsion of small gaseous molecules such as acetylene or 2-butyne.\n\nThe same two-step procedure was used in the synthesis of the naturally occurring cyclophane turriane.\n\nTrisamidomolybdenum(VI) alkylidyne complexes catalyze alkyne metathesis.\n\nBy replacing a tungsten alkylidyne by a tungsten nitride and introducing a nitrile Nitrile-Alkyne Cross-Metathesis or NACM couples two nitrile groups together to a new alkyne.

It is located in the region of Samogitia. It is a major site of Catholic pilgrimage in Lithuania.\n\nŠiluva was first mentioned in 1457 in relation to the building of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Bartholomew by the Lithuanian noble Petras Gedgaudas. Later the \"Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" attracted huge numbers of the faithful to Šiluva, some from as far away of what later became Protestant Prussia.\n\nWith the advent of the Reformation in 16th century Lithuania, many of the inhabitants of the Šiluva region converted to Calvinism. This caused the church to eventually be ransacked and closed around 1569. The last parish priest, John Holubka, buried the remaining church valuables and legal documents and deeds in an iron box near the vandalized church.\n\nSubsequent attempts by the Catholics to regain the property through legal proceedings against the Calvinists were hindered by the fact that the exact location of the documents pertaining to the church were unknown. Some Catholics believed that the Blessed Virgin Mary miraculously intervened in the matter by appearing at the church and holding the baby Jesus in her arms and weeping bitterly. The founding documents of the Catholic Church were found shortly after the apparition, and in 1622 the Catholics reclaimed the church. The famous \"Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" resumed in a small wooden church on the site of the apparition, and the icon of the \"Blessed Virgin Mary with the Divine Child\" became renowned as a source for miracles. The current-day Basilica of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was erected on the site in 1786.\n\nThe devotion to Our Lady of Šiluva was suppressed once again during the partition of Lithuania since the event had become a venue for sharing Lithuanian religious and secular books that were smuggled in from Prussia – in spite of a Tsarist ban of any Lithuanian publications in Latin characters. Following the restitution of Lithuania’s independence in 1918, the celebration in Šiluva was reinstated and took on special significance. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940, a policy against popular religious traditions was implemented. The Soviet regime failed to completely suppress the \"Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" although the KGB routinely sabotaged the pilgrimages. An example of the Soviet interference occurred during the pilgrimage in 1979, when the government blocked all of the roads to Šiluva under the pretext that an epidemic of swine fever was rampant in the vicinity.\n\nThroughout its turbulent history, Šiluva has remained the spiritual center for the Catholic faithful from many parts of Lithuania. The Feast of Šiluva has experienced a tremendous revival following the reestablishment of independence in 1990. Pope John Paul II made a special pilgrimage to pray at the National Shrine of Our Lady in Šiluva, during his visit to Lithuania in 1993. On the tenth anniversary of the pope’s visit, a new facility for pilgrims and candidate seminarians was blessed by Archbishop of Kaunas Sigitas Tamkevičius and named \"The John Paul II Home\" (). Lithuanians in the diaspora also hold a strong devotion to Our Lady of Šiluva so that there is a significant chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Šiluva in the United States.\n\n"}

The nonprofit organization was incorporated in the state of New York in 1934. It fosters the readership of poetry through outreach activities such as National Poetry Month, its website Poets.org, the syndicated series Poem-a-Day, \"American Poets\" magazine, readings and events, and poetry resources for K-12 educators. In addition, it sponsors a portfolio of nine major poetry awards, of which the first was a fellowship created in 1946 to support a poet and honor \"distinguished achievement,\" and more than 200 prizes for student poets.\n\nIn 1984, Robert Penn Warren noted that \"To have great poets there must be great audiences, Whitman said, to the more or less unheeding ears of American educators. Ambitiously, hopefully, the Academy has undertaken to remedy this plight.\" In 1998, Dinitia Smith described the Academy of American Poets as \"a venerable body at the symbolic center of the American poetry establishment.\" In 2013, Carolyn Forché described the Academy of American Poets as \"the most important organization in our country helping to keep poetry alive and in our culture.\" \n\nThe Academy of American Poets was created in 1934 in New York City by 23-year-old Marie Bullock with a mission to \"support American poets at all stages of their careers and to foster the appreciation of contemporary poetry.\" In 1936, the Academy of American Poets was officially incorporated as a nonprofit organization. Marie Bullock was the president of the Academy of American Poets for the next half a century, running the organization out of her apartment for thirty of those years. In 1982, Marie Bullock received a Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture. She also had received the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences, the Award for Distinguished Service to the Arts from the National Institute of Arts and Letters. \n\nSince its earliest days, the Academy of American Poets has been guided by an honorary Board of Chancellors composed of established and award-winning poets who serve as advisors to the organization and judge its largest prizes for poets. Past Chancellors include W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Lucille Clifton, Robert Creeley, Marianne Moore, Mark Strand, and May Swenson. Women as well as men were founding poets of the Academy; for example, Florence Hamilton.\n\nAs of 2018, the fifteen Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets are: Elizabeth Alexander, Ellen Bass, Marilyn Chin, Kwame Dawes, Forrest Gander, Linda Gregerson, Terrance Hayes, Brenda Hillman, Marie Howe, Khaled Mattawa, Marilyn Nelson, Alicia Ostriker, Claudia Rankine, Alberto Ríos, and David St. John.\n\nThe Academy of American Poets administers several programs: National Poetry Month; the website Poets.org, which includes a curated collection of poems and essays about poetry, over 800 recordings and videos of poets dating back to the 1960s, and free materials for K-12 teachers, including lesson plans; the syndicated series, Poem-a-Day; and \"American Poets\" magazine. The organization also awards nine major prizes for poets, as well as 200 college awards sponsored at schools across the country.\n\nIn 1998, Fred Viebahn, husband of African-American poet Rita Dove, drew media attention to the lack of diversity on the Academy's Board of Chancellors; up until then, no poet of color had ever been elected to be a Chancellor, and only very few women. Subsequently two female Chancellors, Maxine Kumin and Carolyn Kizer, resigned in protest. The Academy responded by instituting major changes and designating several new chancellors, including African-American poets Lucille Clifton and Yusef Komunyakaa. \n\nElizabeth Kray was hired in 1963 as the first executive director of the Academy of American Poets, and she served the organization until 1981. William Wadsworth served as executive director from 1989-2001. In 2012, poet and nonprofit administrator Jennifer Benka was named executive director of the Academy of American Poets.\n\nIn January 2020 the Academy received a grant of $4.5 million from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, in addition to the $2.2 million provided in 2019. The money will be used for the poet laureate program. \n\nAwards are listed in chronological order of their creation.\n\nOne Academy of American Poets Fellowship is awarded annually for \"distinguished poetic achievement\": Fellows are awarded a stipend which is presently $25,000. The Fellowship program was created in 1946, and was the first of the organization's current portfolio of awards; the Academy's website Poets.org describes it as \"the first of its kind in the United States.\"\n\nFormerly known as the Lamont Poetry Selection, the Laughlin Award is given in recognition of a poet's second published book, and is considered to be the only major award honoring the publication of a poet's second book.\n\nThe award was first established in 1954 by a bequest from the wife of Thomas W. Lamont, who specified that it be used \"for the discovery and encouragement of new poetic genius.\" In 1959, Harvey Shapiro referred to the award as \"roughly, a Pulitzer for bardlings.\"\nInitially, the Lamont Poetry Selection was awarded to a poet's first published book; copies of the book were purchased from its publisher for distribution to the Academy's members. In 1975, the organization changed to selecting a poet's second volume; in an editorial, Peter Davison welcomed the change, suggesting that publishing a second volume was becoming more difficult than publishing the first.\n\nIn 1995, it was endowed by a gift from the Drue Heinz Trust, and it was renamed to honor James Laughlin, who founded the publishing house New Directions in 1936. At present, winners receive a cash prize of $5,000, an all-expenses-paid weeklong residency at The Betsy Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, and the Academy of American Poets purchases one thousand copies of the winning book for distribution to its membership; the purchase and distribution essentially guarantee that the book becomes \"a bestseller in the tiny poetry market.\"\n\nEdward Field has described the importance of receiving the Award to his career as follows:\nSeveral of the Award's recipients have subsequently won the highest honors given to mature poets. Donald Hall was named Poet Laureate of the United States in 2004. Donald Justice, Lisel Mueller, Philip Schultz, and Tracy K. Smith have each won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.\n\nThe Academy first began awarding annual $100 prizes to student poets at ten American universities and colleges in 1955. The program has since expanded to include more than 200 schools. According to the Academy, most of these prizes are endowed in perpetuity, though some are funded through other arrangements with the school or through private donors. For a school to become part of the program, a $2,500 endowment contribution is required. Individual schools set the winning criteria for their awards, within the guidelines set by the Academy: winners must be registered students at the school and the school cannot restrict the themes or styles of the entries.\n\nThe Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize is awarded annually for the best volume of poetry written by a living U.S. citizen and published in the previous year in the United States. The Prize was created in 1975 by the New Hope Foundation of Pennsylvania, which was a philanthropic foundation created by Lenore Marshall and her husband, James Marshall, to \"support the arts and the cause of world peace\"; Lenore Marshall, a poet, novelist, editor, and peace activist, had died in 1971.\n\nThe Prize was initially administered by the \"Saturday Review\" magazine. Following the folding of \"Saturday Review\", the Prize was administered by \"The Nation\" magazine. In 1995, administration of the Prize became the responsibility of the Academy of American Poets; the Prize has a permanent endowment, and the cash value of the prize is currently $25,000.\n\nThe Academy of American Poets currently announces three judges for each year's competition in advance. There has been some criticism of the Academy's procedures for mitigating the judges' conflicts of interest, since the judges are often acquainted with some of the poets whose volumes are nominated.\n\nNamed after poet Walt Whitman, the award is based on a competition of book-length poetry manuscripts by American poets who have not yet published a book. It has been described as \"a transformative honor that includes publication and distribution of the book though the Academy, $5,000 in cash and a residency at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation.\" The Library of Congress includes the Award among distinctions noted for poets, as does \"The New York Times\", which also occasionally publishes articles about new awards.\n\nThe award was established in 1975. In a \"New York Times\" opinion piece from 1985, the novelist John Barth noted that 1475 manuscripts had been entered into one of the Whitman Award competitions, which exceeded the number of subscribers to some poetry journals. From 1992 to 2014, Louisiana State University Press published each volume as part of its \"Walt Whitman Award Series\" Beginning 2015, Graywolf Press published the winning manuscript. The Academy purchases and distributes copies to its members, along with copies of the winning volume for the James Laughlin Award.\n\nThis $1,000 award recognizes a poetry collection translated from any language into English and published in the previous calendar year. Established in 1976, it is given annually. A noted translator chooses the winning book.\n\nNamed for Wallace Stevens, the award was established in 1994 by Dorothea Tanning to \"recognize outstanding and proven mastery in the art of poetry\". Nominations are not accepted. The winner, who must be an American citizen, is chosen by the Academy of American Poets Board of Chancellors and receives $100,000.\n\nEstablished in 1995, the award seeks to recognize American translators for \"outstanding translations into English of modern Italian poetry\" that have been published through non-self-publication means. The prize alternates annually between a straight $10,000 book price and a fellowship at the American Academy in Rome and $20,000 for use in advancing a \"significant work-in-progress\", such as through travel or study. The award is administered for the New York Community Trust and funded by a bequest from Sonia Raiziss Giop.\n\nEstablished in 2013, the Aliki Perroti and Seth Frank Most Promising Young Poet Award recognizes a student poet twenty-three years old or younger, with an annual cash prize of $1,000. \n\nEstablished in 2017, the Ambroggio Prize is the only annual award of its kind in the United States that honors American poets whose first language is Spanish. It is a $1,000 publication prize given for a book-length poetry manuscript originally written in Spanish and with an English translation. Luis Alberto Ambroggio sponsored the prize to \"celebrate poets in the United States writing in Spanish as an important part of our rich American poetic tradition.\"\n\nPast awards include the Copernicus Award (from 1974 to 1977), the Edgar Allan Poe Award (from 1974 to 1977), and the Peter I. B. Lavan Younger Poets Award (from 1983 to 1994).\n"}

The ice sheet pushed material to form the ridge, which is composed of \"Halton Till\" sediment, rich in silt and clay. By contrast, the Oak Ridges Moraine is primarily sand and gravel.

{"id": "1991441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991441", "title": "Double beta decay", "text": "Double beta decay\n\nIn nuclear physics, double beta decay is a type of radioactive decay in which two neutrons are simultaneously transformed into two protons, or vice versa, inside an atomic nucleus. As in single beta decay, this process allows the atom to move closer to the optimal ratio of protons and neutrons. As a result of this transformation, the nucleus emits two detectable beta particles, which are electrons or positrons.\n\nThe literature distinguishes between two types of double beta decay: \"ordinary\" double beta decay and \"neutrinoless\" double beta decay. In ordinary double beta decay, which has been observed in several isotopes, two electrons and two electron antineutrinos are emitted from the decaying nucleus. In neutrinoless double beta decay, a hypothesized process that has never been observed, only electrons would be emitted.\n\nThe idea of double beta decay was first proposed by Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1935. In 1937, Ettore Majorana demonstrated that all results of beta decay theory remain unchanged if the neutrino were its own antiparticle, now known as a Majorana particle. In 1939, Wendell H. Furry proposed that if neutrinos are Majorana particles, then double beta decay can proceed without the emission of any neutrinos, via the process now called neutrinoless double beta decay. It is not yet known whether the neutrino is a Majorana particle and, relatedly, whether neutrinoless double beta exists in nature.\n\nIn 1930–40s, parity violation in weak interactions was not known, and consequently calculations showed that neutrinoless double beta decay should be much more likely to occur than ordinary double beta decay, if neutrinos were Majorana particles. The predicted half-lives were on the order of 10 years. Efforts to observe the process in laboratory date back to at least 1948 when Edward L. Fireman made the first attempt to directly measure the half-life of the isotope with a Geiger counter. Radiometric experiments through about 1960 produced negative results or false positives, not confirmed by later experiments. In 1950, for the first time the double beta decay half-life of was measured by geochemical methods to be 1.4 years, reasonably close to the modern value. This involved detecting the concentration in minerals of the xenon produced by the decay.\n\nIn 1956, after the V-A nature of weak interactions was established, it became clear that the half-life of neutrinoless double beta decay would significantly exceed that of ordinary double beta decay. Despite significant progress in experimental techniques in 1960–70s, double beta decay was not observed in a laboratory until the 1980s. Experiments had only been able to establish the lower bound for the half-life—about 10 years. At the same time, geochemical experiments detected the double beta decay of and .\n\nDouble beta decay was first observed in a laboratory in 1987 by the group of Michael Moe at UC Irvine in . Since then, many experiments have observed ordinary double beta decay in other isotopes. None of those experiments have produced positive results for the neutrinoless process, raising the half-life lower bound to approximately 10 years. Geochemical experiments continued through the 1990s, producing positive results for several isotopes. Double beta decay is the rarest known kind of radioactive decay; as of 2019 it has been observed in only 14 isotopes (including double electron capture in observed in 2001, observed in 2013, and observed in 2019), and all have a mean lifetime over 10 yr (table below).\n\nIn a typical double beta decay, two neutrons in the nucleus are converted to protons, and two electrons and two electron antineutrinos are emitted. The process can be thought as two simultaneous beta minus decays. In order for (double) beta decay to be possible, the final nucleus must have a larger binding energy than the original nucleus. For some nuclei, such as germanium-76, the isobar one atomic number higher (arsenic-76) has a smaller binding energy, preventing single beta decay. However, the isobar with atomic number two higher, selenium-76, has a larger binding energy, so double beta decay is allowed.\n\nThe emission spectrum of the two electrons can be computed in a similar way to beta emission spectrum using Fermi's Golden Rule. The differential rate is given by\n\nwhere the subscripts refer to each electron, is kinetic energy, is total energy, is the Fermi Function with \"Z\" the charge of the final-state nucleus, is momentum, is velocity in units of , is the angle between the electrons, and is the Q value of the decay.\n\nFor some nuclei, the process occurs as conversion of two protons to neutrons, emitting two electron neutrinos and absorbing two orbital electrons (double electron capture). If the mass difference between the parent and daughter atoms is more than 1.022 MeV/c (two electron masses), another decay is accessible, capture of one orbital electron and emission of one positron. When the mass difference is more than 2.044 MeV/c (four electron masses), emission of two positrons is possible. These theoretical decay branches have not been observed.\n\nThere are 35 naturally occurring isotopes capable of double beta decay. In practice, the decay can be observed when the single beta decay is forbidden by energy conservation. This happens for elements with an even atomic number and even neutron number, which are more stable due to spin-coupling. When single beta decay or alpha decay also occur, the double beta decay rate is generally too low to observe. However, the double beta decay of (also an alpha emitter) has been measured radiochemically. Two other nuclides in which double beta decay has been observed, and , can also theoretically single beta decay, but this decay is extremely suppressed and has never been observed.\n\nFourteen isotopes have been experimentally observed undergoing two-neutrino double beta decay (ββ) or double electron capture (εε). The table below contains nuclides with the latest experimentally measured half-lives, as of December 2016, except for Xe (for which double electron capture was first observed in 2019). Where two uncertainties are specified, the first one is statistical uncertainty and the second is systematic.\nSearches for double beta decay in isotopes that present significantly greater experimental challenges are ongoing. One such isotope is , which is expected to decay in addition to.\n\nThe following known nuclides with \"A\" ≤ 260 are theoretically capable of double beta decay, where red are isotopes that have a double-beta rate measured experimentally and black have yet to be measured experimentally: Ca, , Zn, , Se, , Kr, Zr, , Mo, , Ru, Pd, Cd, , Sn, Sn, , , Xe, , Ce, Nd, Nd, , Sm, Gd, Er, Yb, W, Os, Pt, Hg, Po, Rn, Rn, Ra, Th, , Pu, Cm, Cf, Cf, and Fm.\n\nThe following known nuclides with \"A\" ≤ 260 are theoretically capable of double electron capture, where red are isotopes that have a double-electron capture rate measured and black have yet to be measured experimentally: Ar, Ca, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Se, , Sr, Mo, Ru, Pd, Cd, Cd, Sn, Te, , Xe, , Ba, Ce, Ce, Sm, Gd, Gd, Gd, Dy, Dy, Dy, Er, Er, Yb, Hf, W, Os, Pt, Hg, Rn, Rn, Ra, Th, U, Pu, Cm, Fm, and No.\n\nIf the neutrino is a Majorana particle (i.e., the antineutrino and the neutrino are actually the same particle), and at least one type of neutrino has non-zero mass (which has been established by the neutrino oscillation experiments), then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur. Neutrinoless double beta decay is a lepton number violating process. In the simplest theoretical treatment, known as light neutrino exchange, a nucleon absorbs the neutrino emitted by another nucleon. The exchanged neutrinos are virtual particles.\n\nWith only two electrons in the final state, the electrons' total kinetic energy would be approximately the binding energy difference of the initial and final nuclei, with the nuclear recoil accounting for the rest. Because of momentum conservation, electrons are generally emitted back-to-back. The decay rate for this process is given by\n\nwhere \"G\" is the two-body phase-space factor, \"M\" is the nuclear matrix element, and \"m\" is the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. In the context of light Majorana neutrino exchange, \"m\" is given by\n\nwhere \"m\" are the neutrino masses and the \"U\" are elements of the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) matrix. Therefore, observing neutrinoless double beta decay, in addition to confirming the Majorana neutrino nature, can give information on the absolute neutrino mass scale and Majorana phases in the PMNS matrix, subject to interpretation through theoretical models of the nucleus, which determine the nuclear matrix elements, and models of the decay.\n\nThe observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would require that at least one neutrino is a Majorana particle, irrespective of whether the process is engendered by neutrino exchange.\n\nNumerous experiments have searched for neutrinoless double beta decay. The best-performing experiments have a high mass of the decaying isotope and low backgrounds, with some experiments able to perform particle discrimination and electron tracking. In order to remove backgrounds from cosmic rays, most experiments are located in underground laboratories around the world.\n\nRecent and proposed experiments include:\n\nWhile some experiments have claimed a discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay, modern searches have found no evidence for the decay.\n\nSome members of the Heidelberg-Moscow collaboration claimed a detection of neutrinoless beta decay in Ge in 2001. This claim was criticized by outside physicists as well as other members of the collaboration. In 2006, a refined estimate by the same authors stated the half-life was 2.3 years. This half-life has been excluded at high confidence by other experiments, including in Ge by GERDA.\n\nAs of 2017, the strongest limits on neutrinoless double beta decay have come from GERDA in Ge, CUORE in Te, and EXO-200 and KamLAND-Zen in Xe.\n\nFor mass numbers with more than two beta-stable isobars, quadruple beta decay and its inverse, quadruple electron capture, have been proposed as alternatives to double beta decay in the isobars with the greatest energy excess. These decays are energetically possible in eight nuclei, though partial half-lives compared to single or double beta decay are predicted to be very long; hence, quadruple beta decay is unlikely to be observed. The eight candidate nuclei for quadruple beta decay include Zr, Xe, and Nd capable of quadruple beta-minus decay, and Xe, Ba, Gd, and Dy capable of quadruple beta-plus decay or electron capture. In theory, quadruple beta decay may be experimentally observable in three of these nuclei, with the most promising candidate being Nd. Triple beta decay is also possible for Ca, Zr, and Nd.\n\nMoreover, such a decay mode could also be neutrinoless in physics beyond the standard model. Neutrinoless quadrupole beta decay would violate lepton number in 4 units, as opposed to a lepton number breaking of two units in the case of neutrinoless double beta decay. Therefore there is no 'black-box theorem' and neutrinos could be Dirac particles while allowing these type of processes. In particular, if neutrinoless quadrupole beta decay is found before neutrinoless double beta decay then the expectation is that neutrinos will be Dirac particles. \n\nSo far, searches for triple and quadruple beta decay in Nd have remained unsuccessful.\n\n\n"}

It was resumed by the Commonwealth in 1913 from Frederick Campbell who bought the property in 1881. In 1920 9,000 acres (36 km²) of the Woden Valley, including the Weston Creek district, were subdivided for soldier settlement leases. A 1950s map of the district shows four paddocks, Weston paddock, Track paddock, Brown Hill paddock and Oakey Hill paddock intersecting the area which is now the suburb of Waramanga. Long Gully Road ran through the suburb and the nearest homestead was Cooleman on the Kambah Road just west of the present suburb of Fisher. Cooleman was farmed by the Champion family from about 1932. It was previously known as Allawah and was leased to the Anderson family in 1920. Other properties in the district were Avondale and Weston whose homesteads were in the present suburb of Holder, Yamba in the suburb of Phillip and Iloura, Melrose and Yarra Glen in the suburb of Curtin.\n\nIn June 1968 the suburb of Waramanga was officially gazetted.\n\nThe bushfire which engulfed parts of Canberra on 18 January 2003 flowed out of Mount Taylor Nature Reserve and reached the eastern boundary of the suburb at Badimara Street where it was slowed by residents and stopped by a contrary wind. For more information about the bushfire see Canberra bushfires of 2003.\n\nAt the , Waramanga had a population of 2,629 people. Waramanga residents had a median age of 40 compared to a Canberra median of 35. The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years was A$991 a week, compared to a Canberra wide figure of $998 and an Australia wide figure of $662.\n\nThe population of Waramanga is predominantly Australian-born, 73.9% of people being born in Australia. With 3.9% of the population, the second most common birthplace is the England. Accommodation is mostly separate houses (77.1%), with semi detached, row or terrace houses and townhouses comprising 20.2%.\n\nWaramanga is located in the federal House of Representatives electorate of Bean, which is the largest division in the Australian Capital Territory.

Like their relatives, they are known as \"butterflyfish\". This genus is by far the largest among the Chaetodontidae, with about 90 living species included here, though most might warrant recognition as distinct genera.\n\nThere are currently 87 recognized species in this genus:\n\n\n\nSubgenus \"Exornator\" (including \"Burgessius, Heterochaetodon\" and possibly \"Rhombochaetodon\"; tentatively placed here)\n\nSubgenus \"Lepidochaetodon\" (including \"Tifia\")\n\nSubgenus \"Rhombochaetodon\" (including \"Roaops\", might belong in \"Exornator\"; tentatively placed here)\n\nSubgenus \"\"Citharoedus\"\" (tentatively placed here)\n\nSubgenus \"Corallochaetodon\" (tentatively placed here)\n\nSubgenus \"Discochaetodon\"\n\nSubgenus \"Gonochaetodon\" (tentatively placed here)\n\nSubgenus \"Megaprotodon\"\n\nSubgenus \"Tetrachaetodon\"\n\nIncluding \"Aspilurochaetodon, Chaetodontops\"\nMost are probably either \"Chaetodon sensu stricto\" or \"C. robustus\" group.\n\nSeveral subgenera have been proposed for splitting out of this group. It is becoming clear how the genus might be split up, with a range of DNA sequence data in large parts agreeing with S.D. Blum's landmark 1988 phylogenetic assessment of osteology.\n\nBasically, a core group around the type species \"Chaetodon capistratus\" would remain in \"Chaetodon\", while maybe four clades would be split off. These could use the names \"Lepidochaetodon\", \"Megaprotodon\" and \"Rabdophorus\", and there is one unnamed group containing the Three-banded Butterflyfish (\"C. robustus\") and its relatives. But the monophyly of the \"Lepidochaetodon\" group is not fully established; it is both unclear whether \"Rhombochaetodon\" is a lineage distinct from \"Exornator\", and whether \"Lepidochaetodon\" is indeed closer to these than to any other \"Chaetodon\", particularly to some lineages otherwise placed in \"Megaprotodon\".\n\n\"Prognathodes\", for some time contained in \"Chaetodon\", is worthy of recognition as full genus, as is \"Roa\".\n\nHistorically, more distantly related fish were placed in \"Chaetodon\" too, for resembling them in details – e.g. the common scat \"Scatophagus argus\", which has a similar shape and size, as well as armored larvae like the Chaetodontidae – or simply because they are colorful, smallish, and unusually-looking – e.g. the quite unrelated paradise fish, as \"C. chinensis\".\n\nThe oldest fossils that are usually assigned to \"Chaetodon\" date from the late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago. But since it is not easy to distinguish this genus from close relatives, it may be that the Oligocene fossils are actually of other Chaetodontidae. The fossil record of this family is scant indeed, only \"Chelmon\" (or some similar genus like \"Chelmonops\" or \"Coradion\") being known from Miocene remains. As even crude molecular clocks suggest that the ancestors of the \"Chaetodon\" and the \"Chelmops\" lineage diverged in the Late Eocene already, nothing more can be said without new fossils being discovered.\n\n"}

She was the eighth and youngest daughter of Emperor Ninkō and his concubine, Hashimoto Tsuneko – renamed Kangyō'in (観行院) after she took the tonsure. She was the younger half-sister of Emperor Kōmei. A few months before her birth, her father, Emperor Ninkō, died unexpectedly. Born on 1 August 1846, her official birth date was changed to 10 May because the actual birth date was a bad omen date, and a double bad omen with the death of her father a few months before.\n\nShe was known as an excellent calligrapher and she was also highly regarded as a \"waka\" poet.\n\n\nIn 1851, Chikako was engaged to Prince Arisugawa Taruhito (有栖川宮熾仁親王). However, this engagement was subsequently broken when the Imperial court needed someone for a political marriage with the Tokugawa shogunate. Such a marriage had been arranged \nby the \"rōjū\" Andō Nobumasa and Kuze Hirochika in order to foster reconciliation between the Imperial court and the shogunate, but the original candidate for the marriage died in 1861. Subsequently, the Shogunate petitioned the court for a royal marriage between Princess Kazu and Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi.\n\nInitially, Princess Kazu refused, and her brother Emperor Kōmei declined the shogunate request stating that Kazu was already engaged and did not want to leave Kyoto, and that, like any woman in Japan, his own sister could not be compelled to marry anyone she did not wish to marry, even by Imperial order. However, the proposal was taken up enthusiastically by a number of people, including Princess Kazu's mother and uncle as well as several prominent kuge at the Imperial court, who persuaded both the Emperor and Princess Kazu to acquiesce to the request. Eventually Emperor Kōmei was persuaded to accept the proposal if, in return, the shogunate would repudiate the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States, and return to the previous isolationist policy.\n\nIt was then resolved that if Princess Kazu continued to refuse to accept the marriage, Emperor Kōmei would abdicate, another member of the Imperial family would be chosen instead, and that Princess Kazu would have to become a nun. Under pressure from her family, unwilling to be responsible for Emperor Kōmei's abdication and threatened with the monastery, Princess Kazu finally agreed, but gave several conditions including demands that her lifestyle in Edo would remain the same as in Kyoto and that she would be able to return to Kyoto on the anniversaries of her father's death. Emperor Kōmei would also add the conditions that the Shogunate must deliver on its promises on foreign affairs, work out a strategy to improve the livelihood of artisans unable to compete with cheap foreign imports, and that Princess Kazu's conditions must be met. Emperor Kōmei would then make his sister a \"naishinnō\".\n\nIn 1862, Chikako, her mother Kangyō-in, and her chief attendant Niwata Tsuguko moved to Edo Castle with a number of attendants. Due to concerns over attacks by those against the Tokugawa shogunate's policies, security forces from dozens of hans were mobilised to protect the procession. In addition, rumours that the support in the court for Princess Kazu's unprecedented marriage was the result of Tokugawa bribery and scheme to hold an Imperial Princess hostage led Emperor Kōmei to send Iwakura Tomomi to safeguard the court's interests. Iwakura would force the \"shōgun\" to put a vow of loyalty to paper before returning to Kyoto.\n\nThe marriage ceremony was held on 11 February 1862. This ceremony differed from that of all previous Tokugawa \"shōguns\": having been made a \"naishinnō\" by her brother before leaving Kyoto, Kazu now outranked her husband as well as her mother-in-law, Tenshō-in. Furthermore, Princess Kazu retained the customs of the Imperial palace, which caused considerable friction with Lady Tenshō-in. However, she apparently enjoyed such a good relationship with her husband that they are usually called the closest couple out of all the Tokugawa \"shōguns\", and Iemochi only once took a concubine, which the princess gave him permission to do. Eventually Tenshō-in would reconcile with Princess Kazu, and the \"bakufu\" submitted to her order to address her as \"Kazu-no-Miya-sama\", as opposed to the traditional \"Midai-sama\".\n\nA series of tragedies hit Princess Kazu between 1865 and 1867. Her mother, who followed her to Edo to keep her company, died on 10 August 1865, followed by her husband \"shōgun\" Iemochi, who died in Osaka while commanding the Chōshū Expedition on 20 July 1866. She became a Buddhist nun, receiving the title of Seikan'in-no-miya \n(静寛院宮) on 9 December 1866, but just a few weeks later her brother Emperor Komei would also pass away.\n\nThe death of Shogun Iemochi put an end to their very short marriage, and the couple did not have any children. When Iemochi's will to have Tokugawa Iesato succeed him arrived in Edo, the \"rōjū\" consulted her and Tenshō-in, voicing opposition to having someone so young as \"shōgun\" during such turbulent times, Seikan'in and Tenshō-in instead supported Tokugawa Yoshinobu, who would become the last Tokugawa Shogun. However their relationship quickly turned sour as public opinion turned against Yoshinobu.\n\nDuring the Meiji Restoration, Seikanin and Tenshō-in helped negotiate for the peaceful surrender of Edo Castle by restraining extremists of both sides. They were therefore instrumental in maintaining the lineage of the Tokugawa family. After the shogunal surrender, Seikanin briefly returned to Kyoto. But after Emperor Meiji moved the capital to Tokyo (the former Edo), he and her uncle persuaded Seikanin to join them there.\n\nSeikan'in arrived in Tokyo in 1874 and she took up residence in the home of Katsu Kaishū, in the mansion in Azabu ichibei-cho. She remained there until her death in 1877 of beriberi, at the young age of 31. Her grave is at Zōjō-ji, in Minato, Tokyo. After World War II, her tomb was excavated for reburial. A photographic plate of a man in traditional hitatare and a tachieboshi was found on her person. The image on the plate disappeared the following day, however, perhaps due to improper handling. As a result, the identity of the male is unknown. Although it is generally believed to have been of her husband, Tokugawa Iemochi, it has also been suggested that it could have been of her former fiancé, Prince Arisugawa Taruhito.\nThe body of Iemochi was found. An old tradition was if the husband died, his wife would cut a piece of her hair, and the hair would be buried with her husband, but the hair that was buried with Iemochi was not Kazunomiya's.\n\nThere is a legend that Princess Kazu gave one of her ladies-in-waiting to Iemochi as a concubine, named Sachi. Sachi followed the \"shōgun\" to Kyoto and Osaka, but one year after Iemochi's death, Sachi was murdered by a samurai from Satsuma who believed her to be Princess Kazu.\n\n"}

Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, he played professionally for 10 seasons for his hometown Ottawa Senators. He spent the first three years of his playing career as a left winger before switching to defence, retiring in 1923 due to a throat ailment. Gerard won the Stanley Cup in four consecutive years from 1920 to 1923 (with the Senators three times, and as an injury replacement player with the Toronto St. Patricks in 1922), and was the first player to win the Cup four years in a row. After his playing career he served as a coach and manager, working with the Montreal Maroons from 1925 until 1929, winning the Stanley Cup in 1926. Gerard also coached the New York Americans for two seasons between 1930 and 1932, before returning to the Maroons for two more seasons. He ended his career coaching the St. Louis Eagles in 1934, before retiring due to the same throat issue that had ended his playing career. He died from complications related to it in 1937.\n\nRenowned as a talented athlete in multiple sports, Gerard first gained prominence in rugby football as a halfback for the Ottawa Rough Riders club from 1909 to 1913, though he left the sport when he moved to hockey. Outside hockey he worked initially for the Canadian government as a printer, before working in the Geodetic Survey, ultimately becoming chief engineering clerk. Well-renowned during his hockey-playing career, he was regarded as one of the best defenders of his era, and gained notice for being a tough player, though not considered violent or dirty. Gerard was one of the original nine players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1945. He is also an inductee of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nEddie Gerard was born on February 22, 1890, in Ottawa, one of seven children (four brothers and two sisters). His father, William, was of Scottish descent. Gerard's middle name, George, was in honour of George Washington, who shares the same February 22 birthday. Gerard lived in Ottawa's New Edinburgh neighbourhood, and grew up with future National Hockey League (NHL) players Aurèle Joliat and the four Boucher brothers: Billy, Bobby, Frank, and Georges. Gerard was married to Lillian Mackenzie and had two daughters, Alisa and Margaret.\n\nOutside hockey Gerard worked as a printer and was employed by the Canadian Government Printing Bureau. He changed careers in 1912, moving to the Geodetic Survey, and rose in that field to chief engineering clerk at the time of his death.\n\nThroughout his adult life Gerard dealt with a throat ailment. It had caused discomfort throughout his hockey career, with the cold aggravating it and ultimately leading to his retirement as a player in 1923 and from coaching in 1934. In early August 1937 the issue, which had remained minor, began to worsen. He was admitted to a hospital and examined by doctors, who were unable to treat it. Gerard died in Ottawa on August 7, 1937. He is interred in Ottawa's Beechwood Cemetery.\n\nSkilled in multiple sports, Gerard has been recognized by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame to have been \"a first class cricketer, an outstanding paddler and a better than ordinary baseball player\" in his youth. At age 15 he helped the Ottawa-New Edinburgh Canoe Club win the junior Dominion paddling championship. In later life he was an avid golfer and fisherman, spending his summers near Pembroke, Ontario, a town close to Ottawa. He played rugby football (a forerunner to Canadian football), joining the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1909 as a halfback, helping them win the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union title that year. He continued playing for the Rough Riders until 1913, leaving the team when he turned professional with the Senators. As Canadian football was strictly amateur at the time, Gerard would have been unable to continue in the sport if he became a professional athlete.\n\nGerard began his playing career for the local Ottawa amateur team Ottawa New Edinburghs (also known as the Ottawa Seconds), from the New Edinburgh neighborhood of Ottawa. In 1908 he also joined the Ottawa Victorias in a challenge series for the Stanley Cup against the Cup holders, the Montreal Wanderers; Gerard replaced an injured player in the second game of the two-game, total-goal series, which Montreal won, retaining the Cup. As early as 1910 Gerard was approached by the Ottawa Senators of the professional National Hockey Association (NHA), but he decided to remain an amateur. The Senators continued to inquire over the following years, though it was not until 1913 that Gerard began to seriously consider turning professional.\n\nIn November 1913 he was offered C$1,000 () for the season by the Montreal Canadiens (a high salary for the era), but turned it down. The Senators also made an offer of $1,500 () for two seasons, which would have made Gerard one of the highest paid players in hockey. He also received an offer from the Sydney Hockey Club of the Maritime Hockey League which promised $1,600 () for the season, with an extra $1,000 () to come from advertisements. Having played at the senior amateur level since 1907 for teams in Ottawa, Gerard decided to turn professional in 1913, remaining in his hometown with the Senators. One of the highest regarded athletes in Ottawa, he only agreed to sign with the Senators when they assured him he would be able to keep his government job. Upon signing he was also given a bonus of $400 ().\n\nGerard's first game with the Senators came on January 28, 1914, against the Quebec Bulldogs. He played eleven games with the Senators during the 1913–14 NHA season, and a further two games with the New Edinburghs team. Gerard scored thirteen goals for the Senators and two for the New Edinburghs (assists were not accurately recorded at the time). He appeared in all 20 games of the 1914–15 season. The Senators won the league championship and played the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) for the Stanley Cup; Vancouver won the two-game series and the Cup. In 1915, he was named to the NHA All-Stars which toured British Columbia to play PCHA teams. He again played every game for Ottawa during the 1915–16 season, recording 18 points in 24 games. He followed that with 26 points in 19 games in the 1916–17 season, including a career-best five goals in one game against the Wanderers on February 24, 1917.\n\nThe NHA was replaced by the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917–18 season, and in the first year of the new league Gerard scored 20 points in 20 games. This placed him eighth overall in the league, his highest career scoring finish in either the NHA or NHL. He served as the player-coach of the Senators from 1916 until 1918, when former Senators player Alf Smith was named coach; as captain Gerard was still given a major role in team affairs but was not given much coaching by Smith. Gerard recorded 14 points in 18 games during the 1918–19 season, and a further three goals in five playoff games.\n\nStarting in the 1919–20 season that saw Gerard record 16 points in 22 games, the Senators became one of the most dominant teams in the NHL, winning the Stanley Cup three times in four years between 1920 and 1923, losing only in 1922. The following season Gerard scored 15 points in 24 games. During the fifth and final game of the 1921 Stanley Cup Finals, he had six penalties, one of which was a match penalty near the end of the game.\n\nGerard had another strong showing in 1921–22 season, with 18 points in 21 games, as the Senators won the league championship, though losing to the Toronto St. Patricks in the playoffs. After the Senators were eliminated, Gerard was invited to play in game four of the Stanley Cup Finals. Harry Cameron, a St. Patricks' defenceman, was injured in the previous game, and Vancouver Millionaires' manager Lester Patrick gave permission for Toronto to use Gerard as a replacement. (Teams could bring in replacements for injured players so long as their opponents consented.) Gerard was instrumental in Toronto winning the game and forcing a deciding fifth in the series. Toronto, with Cameron back in the line-up, won the series, and Gerard was included on the winning roster, his third Stanley Cup championship in a row.\n\nBack with the Senators for the following season, Gerard recorded 19 points in 23 games. He broke his collarbone during a series against the Vancouver Maroons and missed the first game of the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals against the Edmonton Eskimos as a result. Gerard returned for the second, and deciding match, which saw the Senators win the Stanley Cup for the third time in four years. This was Gerard's fourth Stanley Cup in a row, and he became the first player to win it in four consecutive years. Before the start of the 1923–24 season Gerard was advised by the team doctor that his throat ailment, though benign, would be made worse by continued physical exertion and breathing the cold air in hockey arenas, and this could ultimately diminish his respiratory system. With no other option Gerard opted to retire from playing finishing his career after ten seasons with the Senators.\n\nIn recognition of his playing career, Gerard was named one of the nine inaugural inductees of the Hockey Hall of Fame when it was opened in 1945. He would also be inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\nDuring the 1924–25 season Gerard was hired by the Montreal Maroons to be their joint coach and manager, replacing Cecil Hart midway through the team's inaugural season. He coached the remaining eleven games of the season, winning only one, as the Maroons finished fifth in the six-team league, eight points ahead of their fellow expansion team, the Boston Bruins. Gerard served the dual role of coach and manager until the 1928–29 season. While in this role he won the Stanley Cup for the fifth time in 1926. The Stanley Cup series against the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League was the last time a non-NHL team played for the Stanley Cup. During the second game of the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals Lorne Chabot, the goalie for the opposing New York Rangers, was injured. It was custom of the era to allow for any goalies in attendance to fill in (teams dressed only one goalie at the time), but Gerard refused to allow the Rangers to use Alec Connell of the Senators, who was at the game. In response, 44-year-old Lester Patrick, the Rangers' coach and manager, took over and helped the Rangers win the game. The Rangers would go on to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nOn July 8, 1929, Gerard, who never had a formal contract, abruptly resigned from the Maroons. Though he never said why he left the team, there were rumours that he was to join the Senators, whose former owner and manager, Tommy Gorman, resigned on the same day from the New York Americans to manage the newly-opened Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico. In his five seasons as the Maroons' coach Gerard coached 223 games, with a record of 80 wins, 75 losses, and 24 ties.\n\nOffered the chance to replace Gorman as coach of the Americans, Gerard turned it down and spent the year away from hockey. The Americans finished last in the Canadian Division in 1929–30 season. They decided to replace player-coach Lionel Conacher, and again offered the position to Gerard, who accepted. One of his first acts as the new manager of the Americans was to trade Conacher, as he did not want the man he replaced looking over his shoulder. He coached the New York Americans for two seasons, 1930–31 and 1931–32, finishing with a record of 34 wins, 40 losses, and 18 ties in 92 games, before resigning. In late 1932, he returned as manager-coach of the Maroons. In the three years Gerard had been away from the Maroons, newspapers kept publishing rumours that he would return to the team. He coached it for two more seasons, 1932–33 and 1933–34, with 41 wins in 96 games, before being released and replaced by Gorman.\n\nBefore the start of the 1934–35 season, the Senators moved from Ottawa to St. Louis, Missouri, and changed their name to the St. Louis Eagles. Gerard was hired as the first coach and manager of the Eagles and replaced his former teammate on the Senators, Georges Boucher. He was given a salary of $4,000 (), plus a bonus of $500 () if they made the playoffs, and another $500 if they won the Stanley Cup. The team lost eleven of their first thirteen games to start the season. A combination of the losses and his continuing health issues relating to his throat (doctors ordered him to stay away from hockey rinks to help his throat) led Gerard to resign as coach of the team on December 11, 1934, with Boucher returning to replace him.\n\nThroughout his career Gerard was seen as one of the most important players on the Senators, and as a key figure in their three Stanley Cup wins. Although he started his time with the Senators as a forward, where he was expected to contribute goals, he transitioned to defence by his fourth season with the team. As a defender he was not counted on to score as much, but instead prevent the opposition, though he was able to \"rush with the power of a forward\". Though of average size for the era (he was listed as being and during his career) Gerard was well known as a physical player: in his obituary he was regarded as someone who \"could hit with the force of a battering-ram\", and hockey historian Charles L. Coleman described him as being \"rugged but not a dirty player [who] took his lumps without a whimper\".\n\nDuring his one game with the St. Patricks in the 1922 Stanley Cup Final, Gerard was noted as \"one of Eastern Canada's premier athletes\", and his \"ability to administer a good heavy body check with lightning speed and clever stick-handling\" was also praised. Sprague Cleghorn, who played three seasons as Gerard's defensive partner, said Gerard \"was fast, he could stick handle, he was afraid of no man living\", and \"had brains\". Gerard was also noted for his leadership of the Senators, and was considered an ideal captain of the team.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally, the channel was devoted to airing documentaries, independent feature films, short films, world cinema, and original programs, such as news about the latest developments from each year's Sundance Film Festival. In recent years, the channel has incorporated original and acquired scripted and reality series into its schedule. It became fully ad-supported in 2013, with programming being edited for content soon thereafter.\n\nAs of July 2015, the channel is available to approximately 60.668 million households with television (52.1% of all subscribers) in the United States. In March 2015, Dish Network's Sling TV announced it would soon begin making AMC channels available to cord cutters, including AMC, BBC America, IFC, Sundance TV, and WE tv.\n\nAfter negotiations during 1994 broke down to turn Robert Redford into a partner in AMC Networks predecessor Rainbow Media's Independent Film Channel, Redford launched Sundance Channel in February 1996 as a joint venture between Showtime Networks (then a division of Viacom, later owned by CBS Corporation and subsequently by ViacomCBS), NBC, and Redford (who also served as the creative director of the network).\n\nThe channel was initially launched on five cable systems in New York City; Los Angeles; Alexandria, Virginia; Chamblee, Georgia; and Pensacola, Florida. It originally operated mainly as a premium channel, commonly packaged with Showtime and its sister networks The Movie Channel and Flix. The channel got its name from Redford's character in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and, while it is an extension of Redford's non-profit Sundance Institute, the channel operates independently of both the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nStrictly a movie channel in its early years, Sundance Channel expanded into original programming by the early 2000s. After limited attempts at original programming – \"City Of Men\", \"House of Boateng\", \"Iconoclasts\", \"The Al Franken Show\", \"The First Amendment Project\". \"The Hill\", and \"TransGeneration\" – Sundance Channel expanded its programming in 2007 by ordering \"One Punk Under God\", \"Sin City Law\", and a prime-time environmental block called \"The Green.\" While the first two programs lasted only one season, the environmental block lasted until 2009.\n\nOn May 7, 2008, the Rainbow Media subsidiary of Cablevision (owners of AMC, IFC, WE tv, and News 12 Networks, and the defunct Voom HD Networks) announced that it had purchased Sundance Channel for $496 million.

As of the 2000 census, the area had an approximate population of 2,200. The ZIP codes are 93105 and 93110, and the community is in area code 805.\n\nHope Ranch is an upscale community which lies along the coast, immediately west of Santa Barbara, California. It is located between Goleta and Santa Barbara. It is considered to be an equestrian community. Hope Ranch is home to 27 miles of riding trails and 10 percent of residents are horse-owners.\n\nHope Ranch is named after Irishman Thomas Hope. Hope moved to Santa Barbara in 1849. Hope acquired the land that became Hope Ranch in approximately 1861 for sheep ranching. He built a two-story home on the property in 1875. Hope's house was used until 1962 as the headquarters of Hope Ranch Park. \n\nIn 1877, Thomas Hope's widow sold 2,000 acres comprising the western portion of the ranch for $250,000 to the Pacific Improvement Company, a holding company formed by the four principals of the Southern Pacific Railroad: Charles Crocker, Collis Potter Huntington, Leland Stanford, and Mark Hopkins Jr. Initial plans to build an 800-room hotel on the property were not consummated, and the Pacific Improvement Company instead announced plans in 1900 to subdivide the land for the construction of villas.\n\nIn 1925, Harold S. Chase organized a syndicate known as La Cumbre Estates Corporation that purchased the 1,200 acres situated west of Las Palmas and Roble Drives and the agricultural land located south of Hollister Avenue. The La Cumbre Estates Corporation developed the land into the residential area that exists today. The first houses constructed were \"Las Terrasas\" built in 1925 as the home of Harold S. Chase and \"Florestal\" built in 1926 for Peter Cooper Bryce.\n\nSince it is not a census-designated place, the boundaries are informal, except where they coincide with incorporated regions. On the east Hope Ranch is bounded by the City of Santa Barbara, on the north by Modoc Road, Hollister Avenue, and Vieja Drive, on the west by a vacant tract of land known as More Mesa, and on the south by the Pacific Ocean.\n\nHope Ranch occupies a hilly area immediately adjacent to the coast; the highest elevation is . The northern boundary of the hilly area is Cieneguitas Creek, which flows down the topographic expression of the More Ranch Fault; this ravine also helps define the informal northern boundary of the suburb. Native vegetation is mostly California oak woodland and chaparral, and many of the homes have been constructed to blend in with the oaks; the area retains much of its tree canopy. Residential roads are narrow and winding, not always signed, and interweave with an elaborate network of horse paths. A road to a private beach is open to residents only (although the beach itself is accessible from public beaches on either side).\n\nHope Ranch is served by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office, but Hope Ranch Homeowner's Association also employs its own security.\n\nChildren attend schools in Hope Elementary District, which consists of three schools: Hope, Monte Vista and Vieja. In state comparisons, these schools rank among the top 20 percent in California. Teenagers generally attend Santa Barbara High School District, but there is also a private high school located in Hope Ranch.\n\nThe local homeowner's association manages the properties of private roads, bridle trails, and the private beach. Since Hope Ranch is in unincorporated Santa Barbara County, law enforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. The private regions additionally have a local \"Hope Ranch Patrol,\" who have only limited law enforcing powers. This group is controlled by the board of Hope Ranch and is in no way connected to either the City of Santa Barbara Police Department or the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe main stretch of road through Hope Ranch is Las Palmas/Marina Drive, a palm tree-lined stretch of roadway along which runs the coastal bike route. Hope Ranch is home to La Cumbre Country Club and Laguna Blanca School, an independent day school, which was founded in 1933.\n\nIn addition to being one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Santa Barbara, Hope Ranch is one of the wealthiest areas in California; the median home price was $2.61 million in 2006. Houses with ocean views generally list for at least $5 million, with oceanfront properties going for $25 million and more.\n\n"}

Despite suffering serious burns in a kitchen accident, Giacomin made the roster of the Providence Reds in the 1960–61 season. In the Original Six days of the 1960s, with only six starting goaltending jobs in the NHL, positions were hard to obtain, and Giacomin starred for the Reds for five full seasons.\n\nNHL teams, particularly the Detroit Red Wings and the New York Rangers, began to express interest in Giacomin. New York traded three players and starting goaltender Marcel Paille to the Reds for Giacomin in 1965. He was impressive in his first month with the Rangers, but faltered thereafter, and lost the starting job. The following season he improved markedly; he led the NHL in shutouts and backstopped the Rangers to their second playoff berth in nine seasons.\n\nA classic stand-up goaltender and a skilled stickhandler known for leaving the crease to play the puck, Giacomin was the Rangers' starting goaltender for the next nine seasons. He led the league in games played for four straight years from 1967 to 1970 and in shutouts in 1967, 1968 and 1971. In 1971 he shared the Vezina Trophy with teammate Gilles Villemure. Typical of his competitive nature, in a game in the 1971 playoffs against Chicago, when Bobby Hull skated over the back of his hand, Giacomin continued to play, and when the Rangers won the game, even the Black Hawks used the word \"guts\" to describe his determination. The Rangers went on to meet the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup finals in 1972, losing in a hard-fought six game series.\n\nGiacomin's effectiveness was reduced in 1975 by injuries. The following season, the Rangers got off to their worst start in ten years (they would miss the playoffs for the first time in a decade) and began to get rid of their high-salaried veterans, Giacomin among them. Many fans were angry when he was put on waivers and claimed by the Detroit Red Wings on October 29, 1975 as the result of a youth movement that resulted in John Davidson taking over in goal. The Red Wings' next game was in New York on November 2, and when Giacomin appeared on the ice in a Red Wing jersey, fans gave him a long standing ovation and cheered for him throughout the game. Rangers fans booed their own team when they took shots or scored on Giacomin, and chanted Giacomin's name throughout the match, which he won for the Red Wings. The evening was voted one of the 50 greatest moments in MSG history.\n\nHe played three respectable seasons for Detroit before a youth movement took over. He retired on January 17, 1978, with a career record of 289-208-97 and a 2.82 GAA.\n\nGiacomin spent the 1979 season as a broadcaster for the New York Islanders, who were beaten in the playoffs by the rival Rangers that spring. Giacomin later served with the Islanders and the Red Wings as an assistant coach and two stints with the Rangers as a goaltending coach.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. His jersey number 1 was the second number retired by the Rangers, on March 15, 1989, joining Rod Gilbert's number 7 that was retired by the Rangers on October 14, 1979.\n\n\n"}

In the Greek Septuagint version of the Bible, and in its Latin translation in the Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 103 in a slightly different numbering system.\n\nThe subject matter and its presentation is closely related both to the first Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1, chronologically younger than the second version in Genesis 2) where likewise the waters are separated before the creation of Sun and Moon, and to older accounts of creation from the Ancient Near East, both Mesopotamian and Egyptian. In particular, the Egyptian Great Hymn to the Aten (14th century BC) is frequently cited as a predecessor. Biblical scholar Mark S. Smith has commented that \"Despite enduring support for the comparison of the two texts, enthusiasm for even indirect influence has been tempered in recent decades. In some quarters, the argument for any form of influence is simply rejected outright. Still some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, argue for Egyptian influence on both the Amarna correspondence (especially in EA 147) and on Psalm 104.\"\n\nOne of the longer psalms, it is traditionally divided into 35 verses. It begins by describing the glory of God (\"Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment\" v. 2).\nVerse 5 asserts that God has \"laid the foundations [מכון] of the Earth\".\nVerses 6 to 13 concern the ordering of the waters, verses 14-18 vegetation and animal life, 19-24 Sun and Moon and the cycle of day and night.\nVerse 26 mentions the Leviathan (sea monster).\n\nVerses 27-30 emphasise how all creatures still depend on the ongoing attention and provision of the creator, and perish should he avert his attention. \nThe concluding verses 31-35 reiterate the power and glory of YHWH, and the composer expresses his adoration, and, in the final verse, his wish that the sinners (חטא) and wicked (רשע) be \"consumed out of the earth\"). \nIn the Masoretic text, the phrase Hallelujah is placed at the end of the final verse. This is lacking in the Septuagint and the Vulgate, but it is rendered by the KJV as \"Praise ye the LORD\".\n\n\n\nIts main liturgical usage in the Eastern Orthodox Church is at the beginning of vespers (evening prayers) and the all-night vigil. While it is technically one of the elements of the vespers service prescribed for the senior reader (that is, the elder or abbot of a monastery, or in a parish the seniormost reader at the kliros), it is customarily read or chanted by a reader after the opening prayers of the service.\n\nThe psalm is meant to be read or chanted in a plain style at services of vespers which are not part of a vigil. When vespers is served as part of a vigil, an abbreviated musical version is usually sung by the choir. Several such musical arrangements of the psalm have been composed over the years; perhaps the most familiar is that found in the Obikhod, or common setting.\n\nIn the context of its vespers/vigil setting, this psalm is understood to be a hymn of creation, in all the fulness wherein God has created it - it speaks of animals, plants, waters, skies, etc. In the scope of the liturgical act, it is often taken to be Adam's song, sung outside the closed gates of Eden from which he has been expelled (cf. Genesis 3). While the reader chants the psalm, the priest stands outside the closed Royal Doors wearing only his epitrachilion, making this symbolism more evident.\n\nThis psalm is used during the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday night (the Vigil being the inauguration of the fifty-day Easter season, the end of Holy Week- and by extension Lent- and the ending of the three-day Easter Triduum of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter). In the Liturgy of the Word, the first reading is the Creation story of the Book of Genesis, and Psalm 104, which deals with the same material, is the responsorial psalm. It is used again during Pentecost, at the end of the Easter season, as the responsorial psalm for the Vigil and the Sunday Mass.\n\nGerman philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder remarked, \"It is worth studying the Hebrew language for ten years in order to read Psalm 104 in the original\".\n\nMusician Bob Marley believed that cannabis use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as Psalm 104 as showing approval of its usage.\n\n\n\n"}

The equation was first suggested for description of plasma by Anatoly Vlasov in 1938 and later discussed by him in detail in a monograph.\n\nFirst, Vlasov argues that the standard kinetic approach based on the Boltzmann equation has difficulties when applied to a description of the plasma with long-range Coulomb interaction. He mentions the following problems arising when applying the kinetic theory based on pair collisions to plasma dynamics:\n\n\nVlasov suggests that these difficulties originate from the long-range character of Coulomb interaction. He starts with the collisionless Boltzmann equation (sometimes called the Vlasov equation, anachronistically in this context), in generalized coordinates:\n\nexplicitly a PDE:\n\nand adapted it to the case of a plasma, leading to the systems of equations shown below. Here is a general distribution function of particles with momentum at coordinates and given time .\n\nInstead of collision-based kinetic description for interaction of charged particles in plasma, Vlasov utilizes a self-consistent collective field created by the charged plasma particles. Such a description uses distribution functions formula_3 and formula_4 for electrons and (positive) plasma ions. The distribution function formula_5 for species describes the number of particles of the species having approximately the momentum formula_6 near the position formula_7 at time . Instead of the Boltzmann equation, the following system of equations was proposed for description of charged components of plasma (electrons and positive ions):\n\nHere is the electron charge, is the speed of light, is the mass of the ion, formula_10 and formula_11 represent collective self-consistent electromagnetic field created in the point formula_7 at time moment by all plasma particles. The essential difference of this system of equations from equations for particles in an external electromagnetic field is that the self-consistent electromagnetic field depends in a complex way on the distribution functions of electrons and ions formula_3 and formula_4.\n\nThe Vlasov–Poisson equations are an approximation of the Vlasov–Maxwell equations in the nonrelativistic zero-magnetic field limit:\n\nand Poisson's equation for self-consistent electric field:\n\nHere is the particle's electric charge, is the particle's mass, formula_17 is the self-consistent electric field, formula_18 the self-consistent electric potential and is the electric charge density.\n\nVlasov–Poisson equations are used to describe various phenomena in plasma, in particular Landau damping and the distributions in a double layer plasma, where they are necessarily strongly non-Maxwellian, and therefore inaccessible to fluid models.\n\nIn fluid descriptions of plasmas (see plasma modeling and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)) one does not consider the velocity distribution. This is achieved by replacing formula_19 with plasma moments such as number density , flow velocity and pressure . They are named plasma moments because the -th moment of formula_20 can be found by integrating formula_21 over velocity. These variables are only functions of position and time, which means that some information is lost. In multifluid theory, the different particle species are treated as different fluids with different pressures, densities and flow velocities. The equations governing the plasma moments are called the moment or fluid equations.\n\nBelow the two most used moment equations are presented (in SI units). Deriving the moment equations from the Vlasov equation requires no assumptions about the distribution function.\n\nThe continuity equation describes how the density changes with time. It can be found by integration of the Vlasov equation over the entire velocity space.\n\nAfter some calculations, one ends up with\n\nThe number density , and the momentum density , are zeroth and first order moments:\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of a particle is given by the Lorentz equation:\n\nBy using this equation and the Vlasov Equation, the momentum equation for each fluid becomes\n\nwhere formula_28 is the pressure tensor. The material derivative is\n\nThe pressure tensor is defined as the particle mass times the covariance matrix of the velocity:\n\n As for ideal MHD, the plasma can be considered as tied to the magnetic field lines when certain conditions are fulfilled. One often says that the magnetic field lines are frozen into the plasma. The frozen-in conditions can be derived from Vlasov equation.\n\nWe introduce the scales and for time, distance and speed respectively. They represent magnitudes of the different parameters which give large changes in formula_20. By large we mean that\n\nWe then write\n\nVlasov equation can now be written\n\nSo far no approximations have been done. To be able to proceed we set formula_35, where formula_36 is the gyro frequency and is the gyroradius. By dividing by , we get\n\nIf formula_38 and formula_39, the two first terms will be much less than formula_20 since formula_41 and formula_42 due to the definitions of and above. Since the last term is of the order of formula_20, we can neglect the two first terms and write\n\nThis equation can be decomposed into a field aligned and a perpendicular part:\n\nThe next step is to write formula_46, where\n\nIt will soon be clear why this is done. With this substitution, we get\n\nIf the parallel electric field is small,\n\nThis equation means that the distribution is gyrotropic. The mean velocity of a gyrotropic distribution is zero. Hence, formula_50 is identical with the mean velocity, , and we have\n\nTo summarize, the gyro period and the gyro radius must be much smaller than the typical times and lengths which give large changes in the distribution function. The gyro radius is often estimated by replacing with the thermal velocity or the Alfvén velocity. In the latter case is often called the inertial length. The frozen-in conditions must be evaluated for each particle species separately. Because electrons have much smaller gyro period and gyro radius than ions, the frozen-in conditions will more often be satisfied.\n\n"}

Both groups lack true gills on the underside of their caps, though they often have gill-like wrinkles and ridges.\n\nThe three most common species, \"Cr. cornucopioides\", \"Cr. lutescens\" and \"Cr. tubaeformis\", are gathered commercially and, unlike \"Cantharellus\", can be easily preserved by drying.\n\nMolecular phylogenetics have been applied to the problem of discriminating between \"Craterellus\" and \"Cantharellus\" genera. Results indicate that the presence of a hollow stipe may be a synapomorphy (a trait corresponding to the evolutionary relationship) which reliably identifies \"Craterellus\" species. \"Cr. cornucopioides\" appears to be a single polymorphic species, while \"Cr. tubaeformis\" may be two separate genetic groups separated by geography.\n\nThe genera Craterellus and \"Cantharellus\" have always been recognized as closely related. The whole group may be recognized by their lack of division into cap and stipe, and their rudimentary or missing gills (\"false gills\"). Originally \"Cantharellus\" was defined by Fries in 1821 to mean all these species together and then in 1825 Persoon separated some species off to create the Craterellus group, with \"Cr. cornucopioides\" as type species. Since then some authorities have tried to merge the two genera again, but DNA studies now indicate that (with recent changes) each genus is monophyletic, and so they are likely to remain separate.\n\nIn the past \"Craterellus\" was distinguished on the basis that \n\nBut phylogenetic DNA work starting with the 2000 paper of Dahlman et al. has shown that some species traditionally placed in \"Cantharellus\" (\"C. tubaeformis\", \"C. ignicolor\" and \"C. lutescens\") really belong in \"Craterellus\", and this means that the second distinguishing rule is no longer valid. On the other hand, the first rule holds up well.\n\nThe taxonomy of these fungi is in a state of flux (particularly due to DNA analysis) and many earlier names are now disputed. The following table gives some of the most important ones. Numerous species of \"Cantharellus\" have at times been classified under \"Craterellus\", but these are mostly excluded from the table.

He played right wing on the GAG line (i.e. Goal-a-Game Line) with Vic Hadfield and Jean Ratelle. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1982, and was the first player in New York Rangers history to have his number retired. Gilbert currently works for the New York Rangers organization.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Gilbert grew up a fan of the Montreal Canadiens. While playing junior hockey for the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters of the OHA in 1960, Gilbert slipped on some garbage strewn on the ice and fell back into the boards, breaking a vertebra in his back and temporarily paralyzing him. Corrective surgery went awry and led to hemorrhaging in his leg, and doctors feared amputation would be necessary, but Gilbert recovered.\n\nAfter finishing his junior career with the Guelph Royals, Gilbert joined the Rangers near the end of the 1960–61 NHL season. He soon became popular with the Rangers' fans, and he rose in prominence as an NHL star. However, it was not without pain. In 1965–66, his career was nearly derailed when he went through a second spinal fusion operation. This surgery was performed by Dr. Kazuo Yanagisawa. Gilbert was out of action for half a season, but he bounced back in 1966–67 and scored 28 goals. On February 24, 1968, he scored four goals in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. The Ratelle-Hadfield-Gilbert line, called the GAG line, proved formidable for years. He played with Team Canada in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. He won the Bill Masterton Trophy in 1976 for his perseverance over his back troubles.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1977–78 NHL season, Gilbert and Rangers' General Manager John Ferguson got into a contract dispute. When Gilbert finally returned to play, he was no longer the Gilbert of old, and retired after 19 seasons, having never won the Stanley Cup. His number 7 was retired by the Rangers on October 14, 1979, the first number to be retired by the team. In 1969 he owned his first restaurant.\nAfter his playing career was over, he opened his own restaurant 'Gilbert's' on Third Avenue near 75th street in Manhattan. As of 2017, Gilbert makes upwards of 30 appearances a year on behalf of the Garden of Dreams Foundation, an outreach program that works with children in the community.\n\nGilbert married Judith Christy in 1991, in a ceremony conducted by New York mayor David Dinkins. \nGilbert is one of ten athletes who were featured in American artist Andy Warhol's 1979 Athlete Series of paintings, which featured prominent sports figures from the 1970s. Others in the series include O.J. Simpson, Chris Evert and Pelé.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1991554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991554", "title": "Laramie Plains", "text": "Laramie Plains\n\nThe Laramie Plains is an arid highland at an elevation of approx. in south central Wyoming in the United States. The plains extend along the upper basin of the Laramie River on the east side of the Medicine Bow Range. The city of Laramie is the largest community in the valley. The plains are separated from the Great Plains to the east by the Laramie Mountains, a spur of the Front Range that extends northward from Larimer County, Colorado west of Cheyenne. The high altitude of the region makes for a cold climate and a relatively short growing season. Unsuitable to most cultivation, the plains have historically been used for livestock raising, primarily of sheep and cattle.\n\nIn 1842 and 1843 John Charles Fremont explored in Wyoming and submitted reports and maps to Congress afterward. He apparently followed local usage and labeled the plains surrounded by mountains in southeast Wyoming “Laramie Plains.” His 1842 map used the term twice at the northern and southern extremes: just south of the Laramie Mountains near Red Buttes (near present-day Casper) in the north and straddling the Laramie River not far from the future site of Laramie in the south. In 1843 he camped on Laramie Plains, at the base of Elk Mountain. This usage was followed in subsequent commercial maps such as the 1876 Rand McNally, and finally the U.S. Geologic Survey’s Geographic Names Committee adopted the name in June 2004.\n\nThe Laramie Plains in the 19th century were not occupied by any one tribe but instead utilized by the Northern Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, Oglala Sioux, Eastern Shoshone, and White River Utes. Sources state that the Laramie Plains “fell outside what would be considered the home territories of the tribes that used it.”. The territories of these tribes abutted on the Plains. Francis Parkman relates in his book, The Oregon Trail, how he accompanied a band of Oglala on a buffalo hunt on The Plains in 1846, recording their fears of war parties. He was told that a ten-man Oglala war party led by the son of the band's chief was wiped out there near the Laramie Mountains in 1845 by a Shoshone war party ranging almost into Sioux territory.\n\nThe plains also furnished a convenient transportation route through the region for trails that ascended through the mountains along the Cache la Poudre River, such as the Cherokee Trail, by which Cherokee from Indian Territory (Oklahoma) traveled to California.\n\nCaptain Howard Stansbury, U.S. Army Topographical Engineer, was exploring a route back from the Great Salt Lake over Laramie Plains in the summer of 1849 when his party encountered stampeding buffalo near the present city of Laramie, which was taken to be a sign of Indian hunters. His guide, the celebrated mountain man Jim Bridger, walked out to meet with them and negotiate in sign language, learning they were Sioux and feared Stansbury’s party might be a Crow warriors. The Sioux invited Bridger and Stansbury to their village camped nearby for a feast. At the end of his exploration, Stansbury recommended the route from Fort Bridger in western Wyoming through Laramie Plains to the forks of the Platte (just west of modern North Platte, Nebraska), which later became part of the Overland Trail and Overland Stage Line.\n\nEast-West communications – the Pony Express, the transcontinental telegraph line, and the transcontinental stage line carrying the mails – followed the Oregon Trail to Fort Laramie and over South Pass until 1862, when Indian attacks forced the stage line to reroute to the Overland Trail. A detachment of soldiers from Fort Laramie cut across The Plains and built Fort Halleck at the base of Elk Mountain to protect the line.\n\nIn 1868 the plains were traversed by the route of the Union Pacific Railroad as part of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The building of the railroad caused a boom in the valley population, with the establishment of \"Laramie City\", which later became the site of the University of Wyoming. U.S. Highway 30, an all-weather route from coast-to-coast, was built along the railroad and was known as the Lincoln Highway. Today, Interstate 80 also follows the Overland Trail, coming very close to the site of Fort Halleck (Wyoming) near Fremont’s 1843 campsite at the base of Elk Mountain.\n\n"}

Considered a fleet vehicle by General Motors, the 9C1 package is considered a Special Equipment Options (SEO) code, as opposed to a Regular Production Order (RPO) code. Both groups of options are found on the production code sticker (which on most modern GM vehicles is located in the glove box).\n\nSpecific modifications and upgrades of each version of the 9C1 option package differs by vehicle platform, though it centers around increased durability and performance. Other parts of the 9C1 package are designed to allow for the fitment of required emergency lighting and equipment.\n\nHD features include full perimeter steel frame (there is debate as to whether the 9C1 Caprice uses a thicker frame than the civilian car; GM replacement frame part numbers for the civilian auto and the 9C1 Caprice are the same); oversized front and rear sway bars; full-size spare tire (in the case of the 4th generation 1994-96 Caprice Classic police car); high-output alternator; lifetime-rated green silicone coolant hoses; four-wheel disc brakes; HD steel wheels and speed-rated tires; quick-ratio power steering and transmission and power steering oil coolers; certified digital speedometer; stiffer body mounts and more of them; true dual exhaust; anti-stab steel plates in the front seat backs; performance 3.08 final drive ratio (3.23 w/std.); 200 hp/245 ft·lbf L99 V8 4.3 L (265 cid) SFI engine); and extra wiring for the emergency equipment.\n\nSince the 1970s, Chevrolet has offered factory-produced police car variants of the Chevrolet Nova, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Celebrity, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Caprice, and Chevrolet Lumina. \n\nThe Nova 9C1 was offered to police agencies between 1975 & 1979 originally starting off as a prototype for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in 1974. The Nova 9C1 was available to police agencies as either a 2-door coupe or 4 door sedan with an array of different options.\n\nA 9C1-equipped Malibu with an LT1 350 Z-28 Camaro V8 engine driven by E. Pierce Marshall placed 13th of 47 in the 1979 Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, better known as the Cannonball Run.\n\nStarting in 1986 the Caprice would replace Impala for the retail, taxi, & police markets based on the third generation model which was launched in 1977. Like its civilian counterparts the car would get a facelift in 1987 & would remain the same until 1990. The Caprice 9C1 was available with either a V6 or V8 in this generation.\n\nWhen the 1991 models came the V6 was dropped & only 2 choices of V8 were offered which would remain until 1993. When the 1993-96 model cars lost its rear fender skirts design, this also increased the 9C1's sales, as this feature wasn't popular on the 4th generation Chevrolet Caprice for the 1991-92 model years.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1996, the LT1 350 c.i. engine was a popular option on the 9C1 (the 4.3 V8 (RPO L99) being standard), and standard equipment on the Impala SS, Buick Roadmaster and the Cadillac Fleetwood. The 9C1 option, however was not offered on any of these three models.\n\nIn 1999 the Caprice 9C1 name would be revived for the Middle East based on the Holden Caprice from the WH Statesman/Caprice range for the 2000 model year. This same police package was used in the VT Commodore range at the time which was also sold in the Middle Eastern market as the Lumina. The same range of Holden Caprice almost got imported in North America right around the time that the Impala 9C1 based on the 8th generation Impala in FWD form was about to hit the police market.\n\nThe modern day 9C1 police package has been offered with the 2000-2005 8th generation Impala & 2006-2013 9th generation Impala/2014-2016 Impala Limited in FWD form.\n\nReplacing the Impala, the Caprice PPV (Police Patrol Vehicle) was manufactured by Holden in Australia, a left-hand drive version of the Holden WM/WN Caprice exported to North America. Introduced for 2011, the PPV was offered exclusively for sale to law enforcement. The 9C1 package made its return, denoting patrol-ready versions, deleting the standard center console (for police computers), handbrake (for a footbrake), and vinyl flooring. In 2012, a 3.6L V6 was introduced as a standard engine, with the 6.0L V8 becoming an option (the first time since 1990 that a V6 was offered in a Caprice).\n\nFollowing the introduction of the WN Caprice for 2014, all PPVs adopted the 9C1 package, with the update including a column-mounted transmission shifter. Coinciding with the closure of Australian manufacturing operations by General Motors after the 2017 model year, the Holden/Chevrolet Caprice ended production without a successor. \n\nWhile not directly offered to sale outside of law enforcement, some initial examples of the Caprice PPV were purchased from General Motors as used cars by virtue of factory demonstrators being cycled out by the company, surplus unsold dealer inventory, and special one-time purchases (usually by fleet upfitters for equipment demonstration use).\n\nThe 9C1 name was also offered with the Holden Commodore starting with the 1997-2000 Holden Commodore (VT) & ending with the 2004-2006 Holden Commodore (VZ) by GM's Australian affiliate Holden. The VZ Commodore 9C1 (or VZ Commodore Police Pack) was available to all police organisations in Australia, New Zealand and several in the Middle East as the Lumina 9C1. It was based on the Commodore Executive and added various specification upgrades to cater to the needs of police. Most 9C1s were delivered in white, but were also offered in other colours, normally used as unmarked vehicles.\n\nThe 9C3 feature package is a variant based on the 9C1 package, and has been historically offered alongside 9C1. The largest difference is the interior design differences 9C3 is intended for undercover or supervisor use, and typically features a more consumer-oriented interior starting with the 8th generation Impala in 2001 all the way to the 9th generation Impala Limited. This police package code was originally offered with the Chevrolet Lumina's 1st generation model starting in 1992 & again with the 2nd generation in 1995 as the mid size front wheel drive alternative to the rear wheel drive Caprice sold between 1991 & 1996.\n\nThe Caprice PPV was offered with a 9C3 package from 2011 to 2013. Denoting unmarked/\"detective\" examples, the 9C3 PPV sourced its trim from the Chevrolet Caprice LS (Middle East export, base trim), except for 18-inch steel wheels, AM/FM radio, and fixed-back rear seat. The 9C3 retained the stock gear shifter and hand brake sourced from the Holden Caprice. For 2014 all Caprice PPVs adopted the 9C1 package, regardless of exterior design. \n\n\n"}

Her subsequent film roles include \"Race to Witch Mountain\" (2009), \"Soul Surfer\" (2011), and \"The Way, Way Back\" (2013). She received wider recognition and praise for playing the lead role of Carrie Bradshaw on The CW's series \"The Carrie Diaries\" (2013–2014). In 2019, she played the role of Gypsy Rose Blanchard’s neighbor Lacey in the Hulu miniseries \"The Act\".\n\nRobb was born in Denver, Colorado, the daughter of Janet, an interior designer, and David Robb, an architect. She was named after her maternal great-grandmother, Anna Sophie, and her paternal grandmother, Anna Marie. Robb is of Danish, English, Irish, Scottish, and Swedish descent. She grew up in a devout Christian home and was home-schooled. She started taking an interest in acting and began by performing in front of 500 people on her church stage. She competed in dance and gymnastics for four and a half years, but quit to focus on acting. In 2009, the \"Arapahoe Herald\" reported that she was attending Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado. She graduated in 2012.\n\nAt age eight, Robb was scouted by an agent, and she and her mother drove to Los Angeles.

Robb was a fan of the book before being cast in the role, saying that it \"touched me in a way I hadn't been touched by a book before\".\n\nRobb went on to appear in \"The Reaping\", \"Have Dreams, Will Travel\", \"Jumper\", and \"Spy School\". Despite negative reviews of the film overall, Robb's performance in \"Sleepwalking\" garnered praise. \"Time\" film critic Richard Schickel said: \"There is a wonderful range to Robb's work...this is extraordinarily mature acting from someone this young and she wins our sympathy without once begging for it.\" In 2008, she recorded the voice of Mary Magdalene in \"The Word of Promise: Next Generation – New Testament: Dramatized Audio Bible\". She also starred in \"Race to Witch Mountain\" (2009). In 2010, she appeared in \"The Space Between\". She then starred in \"Soul Surfer\", playing Bethany Hamilton, who continued to surf after losing her arm in a shark attack.\n\nIn May 2011, Robb was announced to star as Wendy in a new and dark take on the classic story about Peter Pan, tentatively titled \"Pan\", but later dropped out of the project. It was reported on February 3, 2012, that Robb had landed a role in \"Life at These Speeds\". Later that month, Robb was cast as Carrie Bradshaw in The CW's \"Sex and the City\" prequel, \"The Carrie Diaries\", and appeared in the summer comedy, \"The Way, Way Back\".\n\nIn October 2013, Robb started filming for \"A Conspiracy on Jekyll Island\", starring alongside Frank Grillo, Ed Westwick, Dianna Agron, John Leguizamo, Minnie Driver, and Maggie Q. The film is directed by Aram Rappaport and produced by Hilary Shor, Atit Shah, and Aaron Becker. It was released as \"The Crash\" in 2017.\n\nRobb played the role of Alice Green in the PBS Civil War historical drama series \"Mercy Street\" from 2016 to 2017.\n\nRobb enrolled at New York University in 2014 and graduated in 2018.\n\nOn March 30, 2008, Robb won her first career award when she was named Leading Young Actress at the Young Artist Awards for her role in \"Bridge to Terabithia\". The film itself won a Young Cast award. On April 24, 2009, she received the \"Horizon Award\" at the 14th Annual Palm Beach International Film Festival. She was awarded the Rising Star Award at the Denver Film Festival on November 12, 2009.\n\n"}
{"id": "1991571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991571", "title": "Beyond Dark Castle", "text": "Beyond Dark Castle\n\nBeyond Dark Castle is a computer game, released for Macintosh in 1987 by Silicon Beach Software. It was designed by Mark Stephen Pierce and programmed by Jonathan Gay. It is the sequel to \"Dark Castle\", with more levels, monsters and items, as well as a larger game map and longer levels. A second sequel, \"Return to Dark Castle\", was released in 2008.\n\nActivision published ports for the Commodore 64 and the Amiga.\n\nThe game starts off with the end of \"Dark Castle\", where Prince Duncan toppled the Black Knight's throne. In the original version, after toppling the throne, the Black Knight stands up shaking his fist, and a gargoyle drops Duncan in Trouble 3. In the newer version by Delta Tao Software, \"Color Dark Castle\", after defeating the Black Knight on advanced, the Black Knight's throne falls down, off the bottom of the screen, and Duncan does a victory dance as it fades out.\n\nWhen starting a new game in \"Beyond Dark Castle\", the player sees Duncan approaching a fireplace and mantle. Duncan attempts to remove a nearby torch from the wall, only to have the whole wall turn around like a trapdoor. Duncan finds himself in a large anteroom, where there are five pedestals. Over the course of the game, the player collects five orbs to fill these pedestals, opening a gate that leads to the final duel with the Black Knight.\n\n\"Beyond Dark Castle\" is much more difficult than \"Dark Castle\". A helicopter backpack has been added and Duncan can now collect and drop bombs. These can be used to destroy snakes, rats, and even walls. There is now a health meter that needs to be replenished, multiple keys can be collected, and the levels now scroll (horizontally and vertically). Games can also be saved and loaded (using a unique \"computer room\"), and there is also a practice mode.\n\nWhile in \"Dark Castle\" the Black Knight's chambers could be entered at any time, \"Beyond Dark Castle\" requires Duncan to collect five orbs which are scattered around the new, much larger castle. As before, the Fireball and Shield must also be acquired before the assault on the Black Knight himself.\n\nThe game has 15 levels, like the first game, which came out of the 5 doors in the Great Hall.\n\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" said that \"Beyond Dark Castle\" was superior to its predecessor, approving of the new save and practice options. While very successful—ranking in the top five on \"Macworld\" list of bestselling Macintosh entertainment software 21 times—it was Silicon Beach's last game, as productivity software like SuperPaint was much more lucrative.\n\nA colorized Mac version was planned by Delta Tao Software but dropped.\n\nA version of \"Dark Castle\" was made for cellphones, which borrows some level designs from this game.\n\n\"Return to Dark Castle\", the sequel, contains all the levels from \"Beyond Dark Castle\", as well as many new ones.\n\n"}

A winger, Gilmour played for the Ottawa Hockey Club in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League. Two of his brothers, Suddy Gilmour and Dave Gilmour, also played with Ottawa. He was a member of five Ottawa Stanley Cup championship teams in 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1909. He also played competitively for the McGill Redmen and Montreal Victorias. He retired from competitive ice hockey in 1909, but returned to play two games for Ottawa in the 1915–16 season.\n\nAt 15, Gilmour played for the Ottawa Aberdeens in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League intermediate division. He played two seasons with the club and joined the Ottawa Hockey Club for the 1903 season, where he played with his brothers Suddy and Dave. He scored seven goals in six games and was a member of the Stanley Cup championship team that was nicknamed the \"Silver Seven\", after the silver nuggets the players were given after the Stanley Cup win by team manager Robert Taylor Shillington, who was a part-owner of a silver mine.\n\nLater in 1903, Gilmour moved to Montreal to attend McGill University, where he played college hockey, and joined Ottawa for some Stanley Cup challenge games, in the 1904 and 1905 seasons and a league game in 1906. After finishing McGill in 1907, Gilmour played one season with the Montreal Victorias, scoring five goals in ten games. He returned to Ottawa to join the now-professional Ottawa Hockey Club for the 1908-09 season, scoring nine goals in eleven games as Ottawa won the league and another Stanley Cup championship. In 1909, Gilmour moved to Montreal, married and stopped playing competitive hockey. Gilmour did play some exhibition games for the Ottawa New Edinburghs in 1911, and played two games with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association (NHA) in 1916.\n\nGilmour was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nBorn in 1885 in Ottawa, Gilmour was one of four sons of five children born to Mr. and Mrs. John Gilmour. The other children were Dave, Sutherland (Suddy), Ward and his sister Gilbert. The family business was lumber, and Gilmour's father was a partner in Gilmour and Highson Lumber. While playing ice hockey for Ottawa, Gilmour was studying engineering at McGill University of Montreal. Gilmour married Merle Woods of Montreal and moved to Paris, France before returning to Canada in 1942 to reside in Mount Royal, Quebec, where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nGilmour is buried at Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa.\n\n"}

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named after Rimouski, Quebec.\n\nFlower-class corvettes like \"Rimouski\" serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \"corvette\" designation was created by the French for classes of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \"flower\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.\n\nCorvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.\n\n\"Rimouski\" was ordered on 22 January 1940 as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down at George T. Davie & Sons Ltd., Lauzon on 12 July 1940 and launched on 3 October 1940. She was commissioned into the RCN on 26 April 1941 at Quebec City.\n\n\"Rimouski\" had her fo'c'sle extended during a refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia that began in March 1943 and lasted until August. She had a second major refit from November 1944 until February 1945. That overhaul was begun at Louisburg, Nova Scotia but was completed at Halifax.\n\nAfter arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia for deployment, \"Rimouski\" was initially assigned to Newfoundland Command as a convoy escort. Along with , she was one of the two first Canadian corvettes to escort an HX convoy in June 1941. She remained as part of Newfoundland Command until June 1942.\n\nIn June 1942, \"Rimouski\" joined the Western Local Escort Force. She remained with this force until March 1943 when she departed for her first significant refit. Upon her return to service, she was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-1. During that time \"Rimouski\" participated in RCN operations as part of Operation Pointe Maisonnette, the Canadian military's counter-offensive to the German military's Operation Kiebitz. Operation Kiebitz was a plan by the \"Kriegsmarine\" to have several senior naval officers (including Otto Kretschmer and Wolfgang Heyda) attempt to escape from the Camp 30 prisoner of war camp at Bowmanville, Ontario to rendezvous for a planned extraction by off Pointe de Maisonnette, New Brunswick on 26–27 September 1943.\n\nCanadian military intelligence and police intercepted and decoded the encrypted \"Kriegsmarine\" instructions to its prisoners at Camp 30 and the RCN planned a response centred on an anti-submarine task force that would be hidden near the extraction point. \"Rimouski\" was outfitted with an experimental version of diffused lighting camouflage for the operation. Military guards were aware of the tunnelling efforts at Camp 30 but deliberately (and covertly) allowed them to proceed so as to not tip off the \"Kriegsmarine\". Incidentally, Wolfgang Heyda did escape, however not by the tunnel as he used a zip wire on electrical cables to carry him outside the camp fence. He made his way by Canadian National Railways passenger trains to northern New Brunswick only to be apprehended by RCN and Canadian Army personnel on shore at the Pointe de Maisonnette lighthouse.\n\n\"U-536\" lurked offshore for the coded light signal from the escapees and the RCN personnel attempted to replicate what the escapees would have done, however the submarine detected the presence of the RCN task force led by \"Rimouski\" and remained submerged and evaded attack or capture, without successfully carrying the prisoners, but was sunk the following month by the Canadian frigate and corvette on 19 November 1943 while she was attacking Convoy SL 139/MKS 30.\n\nIn December 1943, \"Rimouski\" transferred to MOEF escort group C-3. In April 1944, \"Rimouski\" joined Western Approaches Command after being allotted for invasion duties. She was one of 57 RCN warships that participated in Operation Neptune, the code name for the Normandy Landings as part of D-Day (Operation Overlord). On 31 May, she departed Oban to escort the blockships that were part of the constructed bridgehead on the beaches of Normandy. She remained in the English Channel escorting invasion convoys until August, when she returned to Canada.\n\nUpon her return to Canada, \"Rimouski\" briefly served as a training ship at Halifax, before undergoing her second major refit. After workups, she returned to the United Kingdom as a member of escort group EG 41 based in Plymouth. She spent the rest of the war as part of that unit.\n\nA common tradition of painting a mascot on a naval ship's gun shields, \"Rimouski\" featured a boisterous cowboy with a 10-gallon hat lassoing a U-boat from the back of his steed.\n\n\"Rimouski\" was paid off on 24 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for scrapping and broken up in December 1950 at Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n"}

It had 50 program steps and 8 memory registers. Two later versions named TI-57 LCD and TI-57 LCD-II have a LCD display, but were less powerful (ran much slower) and had much less memory: 48 bytes to be allocated between program 'steps' and storage registers.\n\nThe TI-57 lacked non-volatile memory, so any programs entered were lost when the calculator was switched off or the battery ran out.\n\nThe LED display version of the TI-57 had a rechargeable Nickel-Cadmium battery pack BP7 which contains two AA size batteries and electronics to raise the voltage to the 9V required by the calculator. A popular modification is to power it from a 9V battery and use the battery cover of a LED TI-30 or a part of the dismantled battery pack. This modification provides a better battery life than the original battery pack.\n\nIncluded, with at least the original version was a book entitled \"Making Tracks Into Programming\". It was self described as \"A step-by-step learning guide to the power, ease and fun of using your TI Programmable 57\".\n\nRadio Shack also marketed this calculator, rebranded as the EC-4000.\n\nThe programming capabilities of the TI-57 were similar to a primitive macro assembler.\nAny keystroke could be stored, along with some simple program flow control commands and conditional tests. These included:\n\nGTO (GoTO): Causes program pointer to jump immediately to a Label (0-9) or to a specific program step (00 to 49).\n\nSBR (SuBRoutine): Causes a program to jump to a Label, and on encountering an Inv SBR command, continue executing at the instruction immediately following the original SBR.\n\nDSZ (Decrement and Skip on Zero): Decrements storage register zero, and skips the next instruction if the result is zero. There was also an inverse form, Decrement and Skip if Not Zero.\n\nTests for equality/inequality could be performed against a value on the display (the \"x\" register) and a dedicated test register, \"t\". The result of the test would cause the next instruction to be conditionally skipped.\n\nPrograms could be edited by inserting, deleting, or overwriting a program step.\nA NOP (No OPeration) function was provided to allow a program step to be ignored.\nDue to the hard limit of 50 program steps, use of NOP was infrequent.\nThe TI-57 used the \"one step, one instruction\" principle, regardless of whether one instruction required one or up to four keypresses.\n\nThe following program generates pseudo-random numbers within the range of 1 to 6.\n"}

It was invented by Gottlob Frege, who also invented predicate calculus, in 1879 as part of his second-order predicate calculus (although Charles Peirce was the first to use the term \"second-order\" and developed his own version of the predicate calculus independently of Frege).\n\nIt makes use of just two logical operators: implication and negation, and it is constituted by six axioms and one inference rule: modus ponens.\n\nFrege's propositional calculus is equivalent to any other classical propositional calculus, such as the \"standard PC\" with 11 axioms. Frege's PC and standard PC share two common axioms: THEN-1 and THEN-2. Notice that axioms THEN-1 through THEN-3 only make use of (and define) the implication operator, whereas axioms FRG-1 through FRG-3 define the negation operator.\n\nThe following theorems will aim to find the remaining nine axioms of standard PC within the \"theorem-space\" of Frege's PC, showing that the theory of standard PC is contained within the theory of Frege's PC.\n\nNote: ¬(A→¬B)→A (TH4), ¬(A→¬B)→B (TH6), and A→(B→¬(A→¬B)) (TH10), so ¬(A→¬B) behaves just like A∧B (compare with axioms AND-1, AND-2, and AND-3).\n\nTH11 is axiom NOT-1 of standard PC, called \"reductio ad absurdum\".\n\nTheorem TH15 is the converse of axiom THEN-2.\n\nCompare TH17 with theorem TH5.\n\nNote: A→((A→B)→B) (TH8), B→((A→B)→B) (TH9), and\n\nTH20 corresponds to axiom NOT-3 of standard PC, called \"tertium non datur\".\n\nTH21 corresponds to axiom NOT-2 of standard PC, called \"ex contradictione quodlibet\".\n\nAll the axioms of standard PC have been derived from Frege's PC, after having let \nA∧B := ¬(A→¬B) and A∨B := (A→B)→B. These expressions are not unique, e.g. A∨B could also have been defined as (B→A)→A, ¬A→B, or ¬B→A. Notice, though, that the definition A∨B := (A→B)→B contains no negations. On the other hand, A∧B cannot be defined in terms of implication alone, without using negation.\n\nIn a sense, the expressions A∧B and A∨B can be thought of as \"black boxes\". Inside, these black boxes contain formulas made up only of implication and negation. The black boxes can contain anything, as long as when plugged into the AND-1 through AND-3 and OR-1 through OR-3 axioms of standard PC the axioms remain true. These axioms provide complete syntactic definitions of the conjunction and disjunction operators.\n\nThe next set of theorems will aim to find the remaining four axioms of Frege's PC within the \"theorem-space\" of standard PC, showing that the theory of Frege's PC is contained within the theory of standard PC.\n\nST2 is axiom FRG-3 of Frege's PC.\n\nST4 is axiom FRG-2 of Frege's PC.\n\nProve ST5: (A→(B→C))→(B→(A→C))\nST5 is axiom THEN-3 of Frege's PC.\n\nST6 is axiom FRG-1 of Frege's PC.\n\nEach of Frege's axioms can be derived from the standard axioms, and each of the standard axioms can be derived from Frege's axioms. This means that the two sets of axioms are interdependent and there is no axiom in one set which is independent from the other set. Therefore, the two sets of axioms generate the same theory: Frege's PC is equivalent to standard PC.\n\n\n"}

A resident of New York, he was active in politics as a Democrat, and served in several elected offices, including member of the New York State Assembly, member of the United States House of Representatives, and United States Senator from 1875 to 1881. His rank in his profession was well summed up by Judge Martin Grover, as being without a superior as an all-round lawyer at the bar of New York State. In dress, manner, decision, learning, and unassuming dignity of bearing and geniality, he was a rare type of the best of the old school of lawyers.\n\nKernan was born in Wayne, New York on January 14, 1816, the son of General William Kernan, who came to America from County Cavan, Ireland in 1800 and Rose Anna (Stubbs) Kernan, who was also a native of Ireland.\n\nHe graduated from Georgetown University in 1836. Kernan then studied law with his brother in law Edward Quinn of Watkins Glen, New York, and moved to Utica, New York in 1839 intending to pursue a legal career. He completed his studies with Joshua A. Spencer, was admitted to the bar in July 1840, and then practiced law in partnership with Spencer as Spencer and Kernan. He later practiced in partnership with relatives as the senior partner of Kernan and Quinn, later Kernan, Quinn and Kernan. From 1854 to 1857, Kernan was Reporter of Decisions for the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nKernan was a longtime Utica school board member, and a member of the board of managers of the New York State Hospital. He also served as president of St. John's Female Orphan Asylum, co-founded in 1843 by his father-in-law, Nicholas Devereux, and Devereux's brother John. It was staffed by the Daughters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland, while the Christian Brothers, ran St. Vincent's orphanage for boys. \n\nHe was a member of the New York State Assembly (Oneida County, 1st District) in 1861, and delegate to the 1867 New York Constitutional Convention. From 1870 until his death, Kernan served on the University of the State of New York Board of Regents.\n\nHe was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-eighth Congress, defeating Republican Roscoe Conkling, and served from March 4, 1863 to March 3, 1865. In Congress he rendered important service as a member of the judiciary committee. In 1864, he was defeated for re-election by Conkling. Their political differences did not interrupt a warm personal friendship. As a member of the New York Assembly and the U.S. House during the American Civil War, Kernan was a prominent War Democrat, and was thoroughly in accord with the national government in its efforts to maintain the integrity of the Union. He was instrumental in having the per capita tax on emigrants declared unconstitutional. In 1871, Kernan was an ally in Samuel J. Tilden's efforts to overthrow the Tweed ring. \n\nIn 1872, he was the Democratic/Liberal Republican candidate for Governor of New York, but he was defeated by Republican John Adams Dix.\n\nIn January 1875, Kernan was elected a U.S. Senator from New York, the first Catholic senator from New York and its first Democratic senator in 24 years. He served from March 4, 1875 to March 3, 1881, alongside Roscoe Conkling. He numbered among his friends Abraham Lincoln, Horatio Seymour, Samuel J. Tilden, Thomas F. Bayard, Grover Cleveland, and other distinguished Americans, and his counsel and advice were often sought by them. He showed so decided a spirit of justice and moderation that he was often consulted by President Lincoln on matters pertaining to the conduct of the war.\n\nAt the 1876 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis, Kernan nominated Samuel J. Tilden for President. In 1880, Kernan received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Georgetown University. In January 1881, Kernan was defeated for re-election by Republican Thomas C. Platt. After Platt's resignation in May 1881, Kernan ran again for the Senate in the following special election but was defeated by Republican Warner Miller. At the Democratic convention of 1884, held at Chicago, he was not a delegate, but he was present at the special request of the leaders of his party and was one of the most efficient advocates, outside of the convention, for the nomination of Grover Cleveland.\n\nHe represented Georgetown College at the Catholic Congress of laymen at Baltimore in 1889, and delivered a memorable address on that occasion. In charity he gave much, considering his means, as he was never a very wealthy man, to his church and to charitable institutions; and his legal advice was often freely given to the clergy and to Georgetown University.\n\nIn 1843, Kernan married Hannah A. Devereux, daughter of Nicholas Devereux of Utica, one of the principal patrons and benefactors of the Catholic Church and its charitable institutions in Central and Western New York. They were the parents of 10 children.\n\nIn the rancor of politics, \"...his religious views were ruthlessly assailed, but during his whole public life no breath of suspicion was ever cast on...his character or the integrity of his action, in the discharge of the high trusts confided to him.\" He was a great home-lover, with no fondness for the theatre, opera, or club life. He was fond of reading, of a game of cards, and was a fine conversationalist. Occasionally, but not often, he attended dinners and receptions in Washington and Utica. He often worked in his home at night over lawsuits and congressional speeches. In person he was tall, had a good figure, and an attractive, intellectual face. Without pretense or sham, he was one of nature's gentlemen. His old age was calm, genial, peaceful, and contented.\n\nKernan died in Utica on September 7, 1892 and was interred at St. Agnes Cemetery in Utica.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1991619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991619", "title": "Cherokee Trail", "text": "Cherokee Trail\n\nThe Cherokee Trail was a historic overland trail through the present-day U.S. states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming that was used from the late 1840s up through the early 1890s. The route was established in 1849 by a wagon train headed to the gold fields in California. Among the members of the expedition were a group of Cherokee. When the train formed in Indian Territory, Lewis Evans of Evansville, Arkansas, was elected Captain. Thus, this expedition is sometimes written as the Evans/Cherokee Train. In 1850 four wagon trains turned west on the Laramie Plains, along Wyoming's southern border to Fort Bridger.\n\nAccording to one source, \"Neither the number of wagons nor the number of people that eventually used this road to cross the Sierra Madres makes this trail significant. What makes this road unique is that Native Americans and their traveling companions did not just cross the Continental Divide; they made a path over the mountains and through the Wyoming Basin.\" \nThe trail was also known as the Trappers' Trail, but the Trapper's Trail from 1820 in Colorado often varied from Cherokee Trail and took a different route in Wyoming. It also went to Taos, New Mexico.\n\nThe route of the trail ran from the Grand River near present-day Salina, Oklahoma, northwest to strike the Santa Fe Trail at McPherson, Kansas.\nFrom there it followed the Santa Fe Trail west, then turned north along the base of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains over the Arkansas/Platte River divide and descended along Cherry Creek (Colorado) into the valley of the South Platte River. The original 1849 trail followed the east side of the South Platte River to present-day Greeley then west via a wagon road to Laporte in Larimer County.\n\nFrom Laporte, the wagon road was built north past present-day Livermore Stage Station to the Laramie Plains The route emerged in southeastern Wyoming near Tie Siding and on across the Laramie Basin. The trail was then blazed westward and northward around the Medicine Bow Range crossing the North Platte River then turning north to present day Rawlins. The trail proceeded west along the route of present Interstate 80, finally joining the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails near Granger, Wyoming.\n\nIn 1850 four Cherokee/white wagon train crossed the South Platte River near present Denver, turned north pioneering a new wagon road to the Laramie Plains (US Hwy 270) . Then west along the present Wyo/Colo border to Green River then NW to Fort Bridger. This route sometimes referred to as the \"disease free\" or \"middle\" route increased each year in numbers of Emigrants and cattle drives until by 1857 becoming the most heavily traveled or the major trail to California. In 1857 a new cutoff of the Cherokee Trail was established when the US Army built a road over Bridger Pass to Fort Bridger. By 1862 the Bridger Pass route of the Cherokee Trail was a well wore road when the Overland Mail and Stage moved from South Pass route on to it. In 1869 the rail road reached Utah ending the Overland Mail. The Cherokee Trail continued as an emigrant route as late as 1883 when the last wagon train from Wise County, Texas to Oregon was documented.\n\nIn 1854, an additional route was blazed on the west side of the South Platte River, crossing the Cache la Poudre River, and then to the Laramie Plains. There the trail turned west near present-day Tie Siding, and proceeded along the Colorado/Wyoming border to Green River and to Fort Bridger where it struck the other emigrant trails.\n\nParts of the 1854 trail can be seen on Bureau of Land Management land in Wyoming, California. In Sweetwater County the trail on BLM sections is marked with concrete posts.\n\nParts of this trail had been traveled and reported earlier in the 19th Century. According to Gardner, General William Ashley had used part of this route as early as 1824. Gardner also mentions that emigrants heading for Oregon wrote about the routes in and out of Browns Park in 1839. By 1849, three routes suitable for crossing the Continental Divide had been identified: Twin Groves, Wyoming, an unnamed location near present-day Rawlings, Wyoming and Bridger's Pass. The Cherokee Trail followed the Twin Groves route. \n\nIn 1849, Lieutenant Abraham Buford, escorting the mail from Santa Fe to the east, turned south at McPherson, Kansas, to follow the recently blazed Evans/Cherokee Trail with Captain Lewis Evans and Lieutenant Captain Peter Mankins, with 2nd Lieutenant George Van Hoose leading the expedition Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, and then connected with another trail to nearby Fort Smith, Arkansas. Starting in 1850 the trail was used continuously by gold seekers, emigrants and cattle drovers from Arkansas, Texas, Missouri, and the Cherokee Nation.\n\nIn 1850, a member of a wagon train en route to California discovered gold in Ralston Creek, a tributary of Clear Creek north of present-day Denver. Stories of this discovery led to further expeditions in 1858, and the subsequent 1859 Colorado Gold Rush.\n\nIn the 1860s portions of the trail from northern Colorado to Fort Bridger in Wyoming were incorporated as part of the Overland Trail and stage route between Kansas and Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe outlaw L. H. Musgrove traveled on the Cherokee Trail from Colorado into Wyoming during the 1860s. A native of Mississippi, he came to California at the time of the Gold Rush. Apparently deciding that crime was more profitable than panning for gold, he was arrested and charged with murder in Fort Halleck, Wyoming, during 1863. Taken to Denver for trial, he was released on an unexplained technicality, and returned to a life of crime. Musgrove assembled a network of horse thieves known as the Musgrove Gang, who raided government posts and wagon trains along the Colorado Front Range, following the Cherokee Trail. Musgrove was finally captured and taken to jail in Denver. He started a rumor from his cell that friends were planning to help him escape, and that the citizens could not prevent this. Instead, a group of vigilantes demanded that the guards release Musgrove to them. The guards offered no resistance, so the vigilantes took possession of the prisoner. Quickly they moved him to the Larimer Street bridge and ended his criminal career by hanging him beneath the bridge on November 23, 1868.\n\n\n"}

Wilbur was recognized as an Elder in 1802 and acknowledged as a minister in 1812. Always intellectually inclined, Wilbur was the teacher of the local Friends school for many years. In 1822, Wilbur was appointed to an important committee of New England Friends to investigate the \"new light\" movement in Lynn, Massachusetts. He made a handful of travels in the ministry, for which he became known as an exponent of traditional Quakerism.\n\nIn 1831, Wilbur went on his first trip to England and encountered a growing Evangelical thrust among the Friends there, which made him uneasy. Friends had already come through a schism a few years earlier involving Elias Hicks. During this British trip, Wilbur wrote a series of letters to George Crossfield; these letters were well-received statements of Quaker doctrine and have been in print continuously since that time.\n\nThe main body of Friends were called Orthodox because they had remained orthodox in terms of Christianity. But now Wilbur believed that some Orthodox Friends, especially those in England, were so alarmed about Hicks's perceived heterodoxy that they had gone too far in the other direction. He saw that this group of Friends was abandoning the traditional Friends practice of following God's immediate, inward guidance in favor of using their own reason to interpret and follow the Bible. They were stressing a cold intellectual acceptance of the Bible instead of a vital, direct experience of the Holy Spirit in one's heart. Wilbur quoted early Friends, such as Robert Barclay, William Penn, and George Fox to make his case that the traditional view of Friends was that the inward light takes priority over the text of the Bible. At the same time, he agreed that the Bible was inspired by God and was useful as a guide, as had the early Friends.\n\nWilbur returned to the United States in 1833. He became embroiled in a dispute with Joseph John Gurney, a Quaker minister from England who was speaking throughout the United States. Gurney had been heavily involved in the drafting of the London Yearly Meeting's epistle in 1836. In that epistle Friends in England officially voiced their adoption of the more Evangelical views that Wilbur had encountered and disapproved. During Gurney's sojourn in the United States, Wilbur made private comments against Gurney's views to some of his associates in New England Yearly Meeting (which encompassed Friends in the eastern 80% of New England) and acquaintances in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.\n\nIn 1838 some members of New England Yearly Meeting accused Wilbur of making derogatory statements against Gurney in violation of the principle of handling conflicts by going through the proper channels. They ordered South Kingston Monthly Meeting (local body he belonged to) to discipline him, but the local Friends supported Wilbur. Then the Rhode Island Quarterly Meeting (an intermediary group) laid down (dissolved) the South Kingston Monthly Meeting and attached its members to the Greenwich Monthly Meeting. The latter meeting disowned Wilbur in 1843. This disownment was confirmed by his quarterly meeting and then by the yearly meeting as well.\n\nWilbur continued in the Friends movement with the support of many like-minded members. In 1845, a division took place in New England over the unusual treatment of Wilbur and his supporters. The smaller body, comprising about five hundred members, came to be called the \"Wilburites\" for their support of John Wilbur. The larger body came to be called the \"Gurneyites\" for their support of Joseph J. Gurney. In succeeding years, other yearly meetings divided: New York in 1846 and Ohio, Indiana, and Baltimore in 1854. The Wilburite Friends later entered into fellowship with a branch called the Conservative Friends.\n\nWilbur made a second journey to England in 1853–1854. He died in 1856, the same year that two other leading Wilburite Quakers died (Thomas B. Gould and Job Otis).\n\n\n"}

Goodfellow played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for fourteen seasons with the Detroit Red Wings from 1929 to 1944 as both a forward and defenceman. Goodfellow helped the Red Wings win three Stanley Cups, back to back in 1935–36 and 1936–37, and another in 1942–43. He was captain of the Wings for five seasons, including winning the first Red Wings MVP as a defenseman in 1939-40. He played on the team until 1942 when he was succeeded by Syd Howe as team captain. Goodfellow was the first Red Wing to have won the NHL's Hart Trophy (MVP) for the 1939–40 season. Goodfellow was the first Red Wing to receive this award and one of only four Red Wings in history to win the Hart; the other three being six-time winner Gordie Howe, Sid Abel (1949) and Sergei Fedorov (1994). After retiring from playing, Goodfellow coached in the American Hockey League (AHL) and later with the Chicago Black Hawks of the NHL.\n\nWhile still a junior, Goodfellow signed a contract with the professional Saskatoon Sheiks of the Western Canada Hockey League on December 25, 1924. When Saskatoon called him up in December 1926, he refused to report and played senior hockey with the Ottawa Montagnards of the Ottawa City Hockey League instead. While playing in Ottawa, his professional rights were traded to Detroit Olympics of the AHL for $4,000 in February 1927. Goodfellow remained in Ottawa and was a member of the Montagnards' 1927–28 senior championship team. In 1928, he joined the Olympics and played with the club for one season. The following year, he signed with the of the NHL, starting a fourteen-year career in the NHL with the franchise. Goodfellow was a high-scoring forward and the original center in a famous line with Herbie Lewis and Larry Aurie. During the 1930–31 season, he scored 25 goals (a franchise record that stood for fourteen years) and 48 points and was second to Howie Morenz in overall league scoring. After three seasons Ebbie switched to defence for the benefit of the team. Position switches were (and are) rare in the NHL, but it was as a defenceman that he won the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1940 and three All-Star Teams.\n\nGoodfellow displayed even more versatility during the 1942–43 season. He missed most of the season due to injury, but when coach Jack Adams was suspended during the 1943 playoffs, Goodfellow agreed to serve as coach during the suspension. Detroit went on to win the Stanley Cup in 1943, and Goodfellow's name was engraved on the Cup for a third and final time. He was one of the last NHL players to have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup as both player and coach as league rules changed and playing coaches were eliminated. Goodfellow retired to the private sector the following season after knee problems began to slow him down.\n\nAt the start of the 1947-48 season he was persuaded out of retirement by the St. Louis Flyers of the American Hockey League (AHL). In his two years as coach of the Flyers, Ebbie was able to lead them from last place to the AHL Western Division Championship, the team's highest achievement at that time. Succeeding Charlie Conacher, Goodfellow became the coach of the Chicago Black Hawks for the seasons of 1950–51 and 1951–52. After little success with the Black Hawks, Goodfellow finally retired from the NHL for good.\n\nGoodfellow was a founding member of the Detroit Red Wings Alumni Association, a charitable organization formed in 1959 and still in operation today. Goodfellow was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963 and served for twenty-one years on the Hockey Hall of Fame selection committee. He was an avid golfer and one time caddy master at Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He died of cancer on September 10, 1985 in Sarasota, Florida and is buried at White Chapel Cemetery in Troy, Michigan.\n\n\n"}

In 1996, he started five games at running back, rushing 181 times for 788 yards and 5 touchdowns, 16 receptions for 99 yards and 17 kickoff returns for 473 yards and touchdowns. In 1997, Avery started nine games for the Rebels, including the Motor City Bowl. During his final season with the Rebels, Avery totaled 166 carries for 862 yards and 7 touchdowns, added 13 receptions for 113 yards, 8 punt returns for 46 yards, and returned 13 kickoffs for 315 yards and one touchdown.\n\nIn 1997, he was a finalist for the Conerly Trophy.\n\nAvery was selected by the Miami Dolphins in the 1st Round (29th Overall) of the 1998 NFL Draft.\n\nAvery was traded to the Denver Broncos from the Dolphins in exchange for wide receiver Marcus Nash on September 21, 1999. Avery saw limited action with Denver and was released in training camp the following season.\n\nIn 2001, Avery started 10 games for the Chicago Enforcers of the XFL. He led the short-lived XFL in rushing with 800 yards (on 150 carries for a 5.3 yard average), rushed for five touchdowns, and also caught 17 passes for 297 yards and two touchdowns. Avery wore the No. 20 in the XFL, but in the Enforcers' first game of the season against the Orlando Rage he was forced to wear No. 22 for the second half because his jersey was ripped early in the game. After the conclusion of the XFL's 2001 season, Avery attended the Dallas Cowboys training camp but suffered a hamstring injury and was subsequently released.\n\nAvery's most successful year in professional football, to date, was 2002. He signed with the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos on April 26, 2002. Avery finished the season with 229 carries for 1,448 yards (6.3 yd. avg.) and nine touchdowns. Avery started the season as the second string running back behind incumbent starter Ronald Williams: as a result, he was used sparingly in the first four games of the season. When Williams was injured in a week 4 game in Saskatchewan, Avery assumed the starting halfback position. He never looked back, winning the CFL rushing title by almost 300 yards. He scored two touchdowns in the Western Division Finals, leading the Eskimos to a victory and setting the team up for a home appearance in the Grey Cup Championship at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. However, Avery suffered a leg injury in the West Final, which limited his effectiveness in the Grey Cup despite his best efforts. The Eskimos came up short in the Grey Cup game at the hands of the Montreal Alouettes, losing 25–16, but Avery finished the season a winner of the Eddie James Memorial Trophy (as the Western Division's leading rusher) and a CFL All-Star.\n\nAvery signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings on February 13, 2003. He played six games with one rush for 0 yards and 2 receptions, and returned 16 kickoffs for 346 yards, for a 21.6 yard average. Avery was placed on the Vikings injured reserved list with a knee injury on October 24, 2003.\n\nAvery was signed by the CFL's Toronto Argonauts in 2004. Avery did not play in the Argos' two pre-season games, but he made his Toronto debut in Week 1 against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Avery rushed 8 times for 22 yards and caught 5 passes for 27 yards in that game. In Week 8, he met his former club, Edmonton, for the first time ever, and scored his first two touchdowns as an Argonaut. Avery started in the Labour Day Classic against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Hamilton in Week 12, and rushed for 110 yards (his first 100-yard running game as an Argonaut) on 17 carries and 1 touchdown, including his longest career CFL run – 74 yards. Avery did not suit up in Week 20 against Montreal because of a knee injury.\n\nIn the 2004 Eastern Division Semi-Final, Avery started at running back for the Argos, rushed 13 times for 32 yards (longest gain: 19 yards), and caught 1 pass for −5 yards against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Toronto's SkyDome (won by Toronto, 24–6). In the Eastern Final at Montreal, Avery recorded his first career win against the Alouettes in a 26–18 Argos' triumph. Avery spent most of game blocking but was handed the ball 6 times in the second half and raced for 34 yards, including the game winning romp of 25 yards for an Argos' touchdown.\n\nAt the 92nd Grey Cup Championship, Avery started at running back for the Argonauts, rushed 11 times for 75 yards (longest gain: 26 yards), and caught 4 passes for 24 yards (longest gain: 10 yards) to help the Argos win their 15th Grey Cup Championship in team history with a 27–19 triumph over the BC Lions. This Grey Cup championship also marked the first championship at any level for Avery.\n\nIn the 2005 season, Avery missed both Toronto pre-season games due to an adductor injury. Avery started 13 of 15 games at running back for the Argonauts before suffering a season-ending hamstring injury against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in Week 15. In Week 5 against the Alouettes, Avery caught the game-winning touchdown on a 14-yard reception from Argos' quarterback Damon Allen. The following week against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Avery generated 148 all-purpose yards in 34–27 win. In the 2005 Labour Day classic against Hamilton, he generated 90 yards rushing. In Week 11, Avery started at running back and generated 123 all-purpose yards and 1 touchdown against Saskatchewan. In his season-ending game against the Blue Bombers, Avery caught the Argos’ first touchdown pass of the game before leaving in the second quarter with the hamstring injury.\n\nThe 2006 season began with former NFL running back Ricky Williams making a highly publicized move to the Argonauts as a result of an off-season signing (and Williams' NFL suspension for violating the league's drug policy). The star import's presence bumped Avery further down the Argos' running back depth chart, but Williams' broken arm in a July 22 win over Saskatchewan left the door open for Avery. Prior to his scheduled return to the starting lineup against the BC Lions in Week 7, Avery suffered a leg injury in practice which delayed his comeback for another two weeks. On August 12, 2006, Avery made his 2006 debut against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Hamilton rushing for 74 yards on 13 carries while also catching two receptions for 31 yards. The following week against the Montreal Alouettes at home, Avery ran for 94 yards on 21 carries while scoring a touchdown.\n\nOn January 31, 2008, contract ended with the Argonauts.\n\nArmbar Athletics\n\nIn 2014, Avery joined the Hamilton Touch Football League in Hamilton ON Canada.

Today he is still one of the most popular qawwals of the world, and he has given many Qawwali hits. He holds the record for singing the longest commercially released qawwali, \"Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga\", which runs slightly over 150 minutes.\nAziz Mian Qawwal received a worldwide recognition and fame with his Masterworks and earned the title of \"One of the Greatest Qawwals\", Some of his works include – \n(Lyrics by – Tabish Kanpuri & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Abdul Hamid Alam)\n(Lyrics by – Saifuddin Saif)\n(Lyrics by – Allama Simab Akbarabadi & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Tabish Kanpuri & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Abdul Hamid Alam & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Nazeer Banarasi & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Ustaad Qamar Jalalvi & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Purnam Allahbadi & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Qateel Shifai & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Kabir Das, Allama Iqbal, & Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Aziz Mian)\n(Lyrics by – Aziz Mian)\n\nAziz Mian was born as Abdul Aziz (Urdu: عبد العزیز) in up (Uttar Pradesh), British India. The exclamation \"Mian\", which he often used in his qawwalis, became part of his stage name. He began to introduce himself as Aziz Mian Meeruthi. The word \"Meeruthi\" refers to Meerut, a city in northern India, from where he migrated to Pakistan in 1947.\n\nAt the age of ten, he began learning Harmonium under the tutelage of Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan of Lahore. He received sixteen years of training at the Data Ganj Baksh School of Lahore, and earned masters (M.A) degrees in Urdu literature, Arabic and Persian And B.A Degree English from the University of Punjab, Lahore.\n\nAziz Mian was one of the non-traditional Pakistani Qawwals. His voice was raspy and powerful. Aziz Mian was the only prominent qawwal to write his own lyrics (though, like others, he also performed songs written by other poets). Aziz Mian was a contemporary, and often a competitor of Sabri Brothers\n\nHe first began performing at private gatherings. However, his official ‘start' came in 1966, when he performed in front of the Shah of Iran Reza Shah Pahlavi. The Shah of Iran was so moved by his performance that he gave Aziz Mian a gold medal.\nFrom this moment on, Aziz Mian gained popularity and started releasing albums. In addition to singing qawwalis, he was also an expert at singing ghazals. He became a noted member of the qawwal community due to his unique and crisp voice. In the early days of his career, he was nicknamed \"Fauji Qawwal\" () (meaning \"Military Qawwal\") because most of his early stage-performances were in military barracks for the army personnel. He was known for a \"more recitative, more dramatic diction\" and was inclined toward qawwali's religious rather than entertainment qualities, though he also enjoyed success in more \"ashiqana sufi qawwalis\".\n\nHe was fond of discussing religious and Sufi paradoxes in his qawwalis. He directly addressed Allah and complained about the misery of man (the greatest creation of the Almighty). In addition to his own poetry, Aziz Mian performed poetry by Allama Iqbal, and a number of contemporary Urdu poets, including Allama Iqbal, Qamar Jalalvi, Jigar Moradabadi, Tabish Kanpuri S M Sadiq, Saifuddin Saif and Qateel Shifai.\n\nAziz Mian died from complications of hepatitis in Tehran, Iran on 6 December 2000. He was in Iran at the invitation of the Government of Iran, to perform on the occasion of Imam Ali's death anniversary. He is buried in Multan, on the brink of Nau Bahar Nehar[Canal]. His death anniversary (Urs) is celebrated every year on the first Thursday of May, the Urs celebrations commence with the 'Ghusal' ceremony conducted by Mian Saheb's son Shibli Aziz and Rasm e Sandal of Baba Nadir Hussain famously known as 'Tootan Waali Sarkar' who is \"Peer O Murshid (Spiritual Master)\" of Aziz Mian. The Urs celebrations continue for three days, starting with 'Ghusal' followed by 'Chadar Poshi' and 'Mehfil e Samaa' () of Qawwali ('samaa' means the listening audience in Urdu and Arabic). Around seven to eight qawal groups perform. The Celebration terminates after the last ritual of 'Qul'. The Urs (death anniversary) celebration are organized by Shibli Aziz Mian, who is more interested in mysticism and Sufi traditions. He is promoting and propagating these spiritual heritage of his father and have a quite a number of disciples (Mureeds) and followers.\n\nAziz Mian had 12 children. And had nine sons Amir Khusro, Shibli, Junaid, Tabreiz, Imran, Naeem, Aslam and Farhan, etc. His son Shibli is not a qawwal but his successor in Sufism, While All Other Sons Have Followed Footsteps in Qawwali. They are very similar in style to Aziz Mian himself and like other sons of famous qawwals (Amjad Sabri for example, or Waheed and Naveed Chishti), they perform many of their father's hits. Tabrez is however considered to be the closest to his father's style. His looks and his style are a mirror image of his father. Tabrez also toured North America for a tribute to Aziz Mian Qawwal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In total, he played 417 matches and scored 14 goals for Flamengo.\n\nLeandro was capped 27 times for Brazil between September 1981 and May 1986, scoring two goals. He took part at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was part of a star-studded Brazilian team, along with Zico, Júnior, Falcão, Sócrates, and many others, including Éder and Toninho Cerezo. Despite the plethora of creative midfield talent in the team, and the exciting brand of attacking football that they displayed throughout the tournament, Brazil were eliminated in the second round, after placing second in the so-called \"Group of Death\" with rivals and defending champions Argentina, as well as the eventual champions Italy.\n\nLeandro also took part at the 1983 Copa América, where Brazil finished in second place. A principled man, he refused to go to 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, however, after a disagreement with the coach Telê Santana over the exclusion of his teammate Renato from the squad.\n\nLeandro prematurely retired in 1990 at 31 years of age. He currently owns and manages a restaurant and hotel in his hometown Cabo Frio.\n\nConsidered one of the greatest Brazilian defenders of all-time, Leandro started his career as an offensive-minded right-sided full-back or wing-back. In this role, he was capable of delivering decisive crosses to the forwards, or indeed taking a shot at goal himself. He also had an ability to dribble past opposing players and get forward. Leandro was also able to cover the flank both offensively and defensively: he could often be found in the outside right position, yet would get back to defence when needed.\n\nAfter several knee injuries and some surgeries in 1985, Leandro started to play as a centre-back, also achieving much success in this role, and was still called up to the Brazilian national squad to play in this new position.\n\n\n"}

Seasonal produce are also displayed as offerings to the moon. Sweet potatoes are offered to the full moon, while beans or chestnuts are offered to the waxing moon the following month. The alternate names of the celebrations, \"Imomeigetsu\"　(literally \"potato harvest moon\") and \"Mamemeigetsu\" (\"bean harvest moon\") or \"Kurimeigetsu\" (\"chestnut harvest moon\") are derived from these offerings.\n\nTsukimi refers to the Japanese tradition of holding parties to view the harvest moon. The custom is thought to have originated with Japanese aristocrats during the Heian period; influenced by the Chinese custom of Mid-Autumn Festival, they would gather to recite poetry under the full moon of the eighth month of the solar calendar, known as the \"Mid-Autumn Moon.\" On the evening of the full moon, it is traditional to gather in a place where the moon can be seen clearly, decorate the scene with Japanese pampas grass, and to serve white rice dumplings (known as \"Tsukimi dango\"), taro, edamame, chestnuts and other seasonal foods, plus sake as offerings to the moon in order to pray for an abundant harvest. These dishes are known collectively as . Due to the ubiquity of sweet potato or taro among these dishes, the tradition is known as or \"Potato harvest moon\" in some parts of Japan.\n\nFrom 862 until 1683, the Japanese calendar was arranged so that the full moon fell on the 13th day of each month. In 1684, however, the calendar was altered so that the new moon fell on the first day of each month, moving the full moon two weeks later, to the 15th day of the month. While some people in Edo (present-day Tokyo) shifted their Tsukimi activities to the 15th day of the month, others continued to observe the festival on the 13th day. Furthermore, there were various regional observances in some parts of Japan on the 17th day of the month, as well as Buddhist observances on the 23rd or the 26th day, all of which were used as pretexts for often late-night parties during the autumn throughout the Edo period. This custom was brought to a swift end during the Meiji period.\n\nFestivals dedicated to the moon have a long history in Japan. During the Heian period elements of the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival were introduced to Japan. Members of the aristocratic class would hold moon-viewing events aboard boats in order to view the moon's reflection on the surface of the water. The writing of tanka poetry was also an element of such mid-autumn moon viewing festivities.\n\nThere are specific terms in Japanese to refer to occasions when the moon is not visible on the traditional mid-autumn evening, including and . Even when the moon is not visible, however, Tsukimi parties are held. A Unicode emoji exists for Tsukimi, featuring pampas grass, dango and the moon.\n\nIt is traditional to serve Tsukimi dango and seasonal produce offerings during Tsukimi, as described above. In addition, there are several other dishes associated with Tsukimi.\n\nBoiled soba or udon noodles topped with nori and raw egg, then covered with broth are known as \"Tsukimi soba\" or \"Tsukimi udon\". In Kitakyushu an egg served atop yaki udon is known as \"Tenmado\", another name for Tsukimi in the local dialect. Similarly when a raw quail egg is used to top sushi, like battleship sushi gunkanzushi or a handroll temaki it is referred to as tsukimi style. Confectionary, such as Mooncakes, are also enjoyed.\n\nAt some fast food restaurants in Japan a special Fall Menu is offered during September and October featuring fried egg sandwiches known as \"Tsukimi burgers\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1991674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991674", "title": "Horatio (Hamlet)", "text": "Horatio (Hamlet)\n\nHoratio is a character in the tragedy \"Hamlet\", written by William Shakespeare. Horatio's origins are unknown, although he was present on the battlefield when Hamlet's father defeated Fortinbras (the king of Norway), and attended Wittenberg University with Prince Hamlet. He is often not identified with any specific court position, but simply as \"Hamlet's friend\". Because Horatio is not directly involved in the intrigue at the Danish court, he makes a good foil or sounding board for Prince Hamlet. Given his involvement in Wittenberg, a university that defined the institutional switch from theology to humanism, Horatio epitomizes the early modern fusion of Stoic and Protestant rationality.\n\nHoratio is a variation on the Latin name Horatius. Many commentators have pointed out that the name is reminiscent of the Latin words \"ratiō\" (\"reason\") and \"ōrātor\" (\"speaker\"), reminding us of his roles as a reasoner with Prince Hamlet, and of his role at the end of the play, surviving to tell Hamlet's tale.\n\nHoratio makes his first appearance in Act I, Scene 1, when he, Bernardo, and Marcellus encounter the ghost of the deceased King Hamlet. He, having attended a university, is called upon as a scholar and is told to communicate with the ghost by Marcellus, and unsuccessfully attempts to do so. It is he who then explains the conditions surrounding King Hamlet's death. Later, in act three, Horatio is revealed to be Hamlet's most trusted friend, to whom Hamlet reveals all his plans. Horatio symbolizes the ultimate faithful friend. Horatio swears himself to secrecy about the ghost and Hamlet's pre-tense of madness, and conspires with Hamlet to prove Claudius' guilt through the travelling players' production of \"The Murder of Gonzago\". He only questions Hamlet's judgement once, when the latter reveals the fates of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Otherwise, Horatio supports every decision Hamlet makes, no matter how impetuous. He is also the first to know of Hamlet's return from England, and is with him when he learns of Ophelia's death. \n\nAt the end of the play, Horatio intends to finish off the poisoned drink that was intended for Hamlet, saying that he is \"more an antique Roman than a Dane\" (reminiscent of Brutus and Cassius), but the dying prince implores Horatio not to drink from the cup and bids his friend to live and help put things right in Denmark; \"If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, / Absent thee from felicity a while, / And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain / To tell my story.\" Hamlet's last request creates a parallel between the name \"Horatio\" and the Latin \"orator\", meaning \"speaker\".\n\nHoratio is present through most of the major scenes of the play, but Hamlet is usually the only person to acknowledge that he is present; when other characters address him (except in Act I Scene 1), they are almost always telling him to leave. He is often in scenes that are usually remembered as soliloquies, such as Hamlet's famous scene with the skull of Yorick. Horatio is also present during the mousetrap play, the discovery of Ophelia's madness (though the role of an anonymous gentleman-courtier has been substituted in this scene), Hamlet's display at Ophelia's grave, and the final scene. He is the only major character to survive the action of the play.\n\nHoratio's role, although secondary, is central to the drama. Through his role of 'outside observer' that Horatio makes the audience believe Hamlet's actions, no matter how incredible they may look to readers at first sight. For example, Horatio sees the Ghost, so the audience is led to believe that the Ghost is real. \"Horatio is our harbinger of truth.\" \n"}

The bank operated independently in New Brunswick and later in Prince Edward Island until it merged with the Bank of Nova Scotia in 1913.\n\nThe Bank of New Brunswick was established on March 25, 1820 in the pre-Confederation Province of New Brunswick, Canada, under a charter from the British government. It was founded in Saint John, New Brunswick by a group of the colony's prominent businessmen. At the time, Saint John was the largest city in the Maritime Provinces, exceeding in population both Halifax, Nova Scotia, and for a time during the 19th century, even Toronto, Ontario.\n\nJohn Robinson was elected the first President of the Bank of New Brunswick and served until 1824 when he was succeeded by Charles Simonds. The Bank expanded through the acquisition of the City Bank of Saint John in 1839. By 1842, the bank held £100,000 in capital.\n\nFollowing the Great Fire in Saint John, the bank's headquarters were established in a new building built on Prince William Street in 1879, with a neoclassical bank façade reminiscent of a Corinthian temple of finance. The Bank of New Brunswick Building is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.\n\nThe acquisition of the Summerside Bank of P.E.I. in 1901, expanded the Bank's network. Following the City Bank acquisition, City Bank president Thomas Leavitt became president of the Bank of New Brunswick. Leavitt came from a family of merchants, shipowners and shipmasters of Saint John, New Brunswick. The Bank of New Brunswick on 268 Water Street, Summerside, Prince Edward Island, built 1909 to 1910 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.\n\nAfter Confederation in 1867, the four banks which had been established in New Brunswick began to struggle, as more and more investment money began moving to central Canada, and manufacturing in the new province began to decline. Over the objections of The Saint John Board of Trade, Sir John A. Macdonald's Conservative government voted down the Commercial Union Bill of March 5, 1888 which would have given Saint John direct access to a larger market in New England. By the early part of the 20th century it became apparent that none of the four banks were attracting enough capital to remain competitive. Saint John, the largest city, failed to attract investment from overseas despite 4% higher returns compared to Upper Canada.\n\nThe Bank of New Brunswick and its shareholders accepted an offer to merge with the Bank of Nova Scotia on February 15, 1913. \nAs many of its investors were financing the opening up of the west, the bank's headquarters was moved to in Montreal. The Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) eventually moved its headquarters to Toronto - Canada's banking and financial centre.\n\nLike the other Canadian chartered banks established before the 1934 Bank of Canada Act, the Bank of New Brunswick and the Summerside Bank issued their own paper money. Around $30,000 in notes are in circulation. These notes can be reimbursed by the Bank of Canada, but their rarity often leads collectors to purchase them at a premium.\n\n"}

{"id": "1991698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991698", "title": "Saltator", "text": "Saltator\n\nSaltator is a genus of songbirds of the Americas. They are traditionally placed in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae) but now seem to be closer to tanagers (Thraupidae). Their English name is also saltator, except for two dark species known by the more general grosbeak.\n\nThe genus was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with the buff-throated saltator as the type species. The name is from the Latin \"saltator, saltatoris\" \"dancer\".\n\nThe saltators as traditionally defined are apparently neither monophyletic nor allied with the cardinals. As already noted over 100 years ago, they are a morphologically diverse group, encompassing generally robust and fairly drab nine-primaried oscines. The different species may appear more similar to grosbeaks, tanagers or even shrikes than to cardinals, and the patterns of their eggs are also conspicuously diverse. Altogether, the \"genus\" seems more like an assemblage of species brought together largely by seeming even less close to other groups than to each other, rather than by a very close relationship. More extreme cases of adaptive radiation exist in birds, but this process hardly ever occurs outside island groups like Hawaiian honeycreepers, vangas, Malagasy warblers or the famous Galápagos finches.\n\nThe latest comprehensive analysis of the genus was a 1977 study which today would not be accepted whole-cloth because it followed the phenetic methodology then in vogue but now considered outdated. Even in that study the case for \"Saltator\" monophyly was weak. Where \"Saltator\" species have been included in cladistic studies they appear to be related to various tanagers. If this is verified after a more thorough study, they would probably be transferred to this family. Preliminary work seems to support this, but for now they are best considered \"incertae sedis\".\nThe genus contains 15 species:\n\n"}

Like other species in the genus, the plant contains the psychoactive alkaloid aporphine (not to be confused with apomorphine). It was known to the Ancient Egyptian civilization.\n\nIts original habitat may have been along the Nile and other parts of East Africa. It spread more widely in ancient times, including to the Indian subcontinent and Thailand.\n\nThe leaves are broadly rounded, across, with a notch at the leaf stem. The flowers are in diameter.\n\nReports in the literature by persons unfamiliar with its actual growth and blooming cycle have suggested that the flowers open in the morning, rising to the surface of the water, then close and sink at dusk. In fact, the flower buds rise to the surface over a period of two to three days, and when ready, open around 9:30 am and close about 3:00 pm. The flowers and buds do not rise above the water in the morning, nor do they submerge at night. The flowers have pale bluish-white to sky-blue or mauve petals, smoothly changing to a pale yellow in the centre of the flower.\n\nAlong with the white lotus, \"nymphaea lotus\", also native to Egypt, the plant and flower are very frequently depicted in Ancient Egyptian art. They have been depicted in numerous stone carvings and paintings, including the walls of the famous temple of Karnak, and are frequently depicted in connection with \"party scenes\", dancing or in significant spiritual or magical rites such as the rite of passage into the afterlife. King Tut's mummy was covered with the flower. \"N. caerulea\" was considered extremely significant in Egyptian mythology, regarded as a symbol of the sun, since the flowers are closed at night and open again in the morning. At Heliopolis, the origin of the world was taught to have been when the sun god Ra emerged from a lotus flower growing in \"primordial waters\". At night, he was believed to retreat into the flower again. Due to its colour, it was identified, in some beliefs, as having been the original container, in a similar manner to an egg, of Atum, and in similar beliefs Ra, both solar deities. As such, its properties form the origin of the \"lotus variant\" of the Ogdoad cosmogeny. It was the symbol of the Egyptian deity Nefertem.\n\nFor its use in Buddhist art, see \"utpala\".\n\nSome evidence indicates the medicinal effects of plants including \"N. caerulea\" that contain the psychoactive alkaloid aporphine were known to both the Maya and the Ancient Egyptians.\n\nThe mildly sedating effects of \"N. caerulea\" makes it a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical Lotophagi in Homer's \"Odyssey\".\n\nThis lotus has been used to produce perfumes since ancient times; it is also used in aromatherapy.\n\n\"N. caerulea\" is illegal in Latvia since November 2009. It is a schedule 1 drug. Possession of quantities up to 1 gram are fined up to 280 euros, for second offences within a year period criminal charges are applied. Possession of larger quantities can be punished by up to 15 years in prison.\n\n\"N. caerulea\" was banned in Poland in March 2009. Possession and distribution lead to a criminal charge.\n\n\"N. caerulea\" is illegal in Russia since April 2009 along with spice and related products, \"Salvia divinorum, Argyreia nervosa\", and others.\n\n"}

In addition, the company operates AMC Networks International, its global division.\n\nThe company was originally launched in 1980 and formerly known as Rainbow Media Holdings, LLC (or alternately Rainbow Programming Holdings), a subsidiary of Cablevision, but was spun off as a publicly traded company in July 2011. The company is majority-owned and controlled by the Dolan family.\n\nWhen Rainbow was formed in 1980, it originally included Bravo and SportsChannel New York. As SportsChannel expanded by adding other regional networks, these also became part of Rainbow (see SportsChannel America). When SportsChannel was merged into Fox Sports Net, all of these networks except SportsChannel NY (then Fox Sports New York) were gradually sold off. Fox Sports New York was then transferred to the MSG Media division and rebranded MSG+.\n\nRainbow originally started the Playboy Channel in 1982 as a joint-venture with Playboy; Cablevision would later sell its share back to Playboy.\n\n1983 saw the acquisition of Philadelphia's regional sports and movie network PRISM and sibling PRISM New England, as a joint-venture with The Washington Post Company, with CBS acquiring a stake in 1985. While PRISM New England was rebranded as SportsChannel New England upon the acquisition, the original PRISM retained its identity and format (and eventually gained a sister network in SportsChannel Philadelphia). Rainbow assumed full control of PRISM in 1987, and continued to operate it and SportsChannel Philadelphia until 1997, when both channels were shut down to make way for the first Comcast SportsNet.\n\nIn 1988, Cablevision merged their cable networks with NBC, giving NBC 50% ownership in Rainbow. Through a series of transactions, NBC's stake was eventually reduced. In 2002, Cablevision sold its share of Bravo to NBC and as part of the deal, NBC gave up its then 20% share in Rainbow.\n\n1994 saw the launch of an American feed of the Canadian music channel MuchMusic, MuchMusic USA, in partnership with CHUM Limited. CHUM sold their stake to Rainbow in 2000 and revoked their license for the MuchMusic name, which culminated into a rebrand as Fuse in 2003. Fuse became a part of MSG Media in 2010, and has since been spun off as Fuse Media.\n\nThe company also founded Orlando, Florida station WRBW in 1994, which it eventually sold to Chris-Craft in 1998; it was affiliated with the since-defunct UPN, which Chris-Craft owned half of at the time. Chris-Craft later sold its stations, including WRBW, to Fox Television Stations, who currently operates WRBW as a MyNetworkTV station.\n\nRainbow ran the local-minded MSG Metro Channels which launched in 1998, before folding them in late 2005.\n\n2003 saw Rainbow DBS Company launch a DBS satellite service, the HDTV-oriented \"Voom\". The service ceased operations on April 30, 2005, and instead several of Voom's HD channels were launched on Dish Network and Cablevision, now bannered as Voom HD Networks. The networks were discontinued in 2009.\n\nIn 2005, Cablevision considered spinning off its content subsidiary Rainbow Media as a publicly traded company, and making their core cable business private, but withdrew the plan. In 2006, a new plan emerged to privatize all of Cablevision, including Rainbow Media. In January 2007, with no word on if the privatization would go through, Liberty Media expressed interest in acquiring Rainbow Media from Cablevision.\n\nRainbow Media also owned Wedding Central which was shut down the same day AMC Networks went public.\n\nOn March 10, 2011, Cablevision, as approved by its board on December 16, 2010, announced that Rainbow Media would be spun off as a publicly traded company, AMC Networks, later in 2011, and, as said in 2005, making their core cable business private. Rainbow Media's former President Josh Sapan serves as the president and chief executive of AMC Networks which went public on July 1, 2011.\n\nOn May 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would no longer carry the AMC Networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite provider's distribution agreement with the company at the end of June 2012, citing that AMC Networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels.\n\nAMC Networks responded to Dish Network's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by the company's former Voom HD Networks subsidiary (under the company's previous Rainbow Media Holdings brand) (which is pending trial in the New York State Supreme Court), in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish Network for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup and the five remaining channels the following day. Dish Network stated that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.\n\nOn May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, WEtv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WEtv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of \"Mad Men\" urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider, with Dish Network stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings.\n\nOn July 1, 2012, Dish Network dropped AMC, WEtv, and IFC from the channel line-up altogether.\n\nOn July 12, 2012, AMC said in an e-mailed statement that it would stream over the Internet the season premiere of \"Breaking Bad\" to Dish customers. \"Dish subscribers can register online starting July 13 for the show, which airs on July 15. We want to give Dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season.\"\n\nOn October 21, 2012, AMC Networks announced a settlement was reached between them, Cablevision and Dish in which Dish was forced to pay up to $700 million in damages to Cablevision for damages from removing Voom owned channels off the Dish lineup back in 2008, and in return Dish signed a new agreement to bring the AMC Networks owned channels back on the Dish lineup with AMC returning October 21 and the rest on November 1.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the company acquired or joined a joint venture each year. On October 28, 2013, AMC Networks announced it would acquire most of Chellomedia, sans Chello Benelux, an international operator of cable networks, from Liberty Global for around $1.04 billion. On October 23, 2014, AMC confirmed it had purchased a 49.9% stake in BBC America, with BBC Studios retaining the remaining share of the network. In 2015, AMC Networks, along with Upfront Ventures, Daher Capital, Northgate Ventures, invested a round of funding in the Latin YouTube network MiTú.\n\nIn 2016, AMC Networks finalized a partnership agreement with former BET founder Robert L. Johnsons RLJ Company. According to the agreement, AMC will use its programming and distribution clout to benefit Acorn and UMC. Additionally, the RLJ-AMC partnership will allow for greater investment in content from African-American creatives, Johnson emphasized. The agreement called for AMC to provide RLJ with a $60 million loan on a seven-year term and $5 million on a one-year term. AMC has received warrants to purchase at least 20 million shares or the equivalent of 50.1% of the company. The time frame for exercising those warrants is open-ended, AMC said.\n\nOn November 15, 2016, AMC acquired a minority stake in comedy video website and film and television production company Funny or Die, with plans to integrate it with IFC.\n\nOn April 27, 2018, the company, as the owner of IFC, acquired a majority stake in comedy venue operator Levity Live.\n\nOn July 30, 2018, AMC Networks reached a definitive agreement to acquire RLJ Entertainment where AMC would pay $59 million for the remaining RLJE shares not owned by AMC or Robert L. Johnson. The transaction was approved by RLJ Entertainment's stockholders on October 31, and AMC Networks completed the acquisition on November 1. RLJ Entertainment became a privately owned subsidiary of AMC Networks, with Johnson and his affiliates owning a 17% stake.\n\nIn 2019, AMC Networks and the New Zealand public broadcaster TVNZ entered into an agreement to jointly produce \"The Dead Lands\", a Māori–theme supernatural series set in pre-contact New Zealand. The series was distributed by AMC's streaming service Shudder in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland and by TVNZ On Demand in New Zealand.\n\nAs of 2020, the company was reliant upon the scripted television shows which it produces and owns including \"Mad Men\", \"Breaking Bad\", \"The Walking Dead, and \"Better Call Saul\". \n\n\n\n\nOn October 28, 2013, AMC Networks announced it would acquire most of Chellomedia, an international operator of cable networks, from Liberty Global for around $1.04 billion. The acquisition did not include Chello Benelux, owners of Film1 and Sport1. On February 2, 2014, the transaction was completed. What was formerly Chellomedia is now known as AMC Networks International and will allow AMC Networks to distribute its programming worldwide.\n\nOn October 23, 2014, AMC confirmed it had purchased a 49.9% stake in BBC America, with BBC Studios retaining the remaining share of the network. The joint venture will also give AMC, which itself distributes the BBC World News channel in the United States, operational control in BBC America, which will be managed as a stand-alone from AMC's other channels.\n\n"}

He played nine seasons of senior amateur hockey between 1894 and 1902 for the Montreal Victorias and Montreal Shamrocks. Grant was a member of the Victorias squad that won or retained possession of the Stanley Cup five times between 1895 and 1899 during the trophy's challenge era. Grant played cover-point and was known for his speed and skating ability. He is regarded as one of the first defenceman to rush forward and with the puck. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950.\n\nA gifted and fast skater, Grant won speed skating championships at three different age groups when he was 11 years old. He also played amateur lacrosse while he grew up in Montreal, Quebec. His skills transferred to the hockey rink where Grant played cover point (defence). He is regarded as one of the first rushing defencemen in hockey history; Grant used his skating ability to generate offensive chances from his defensive position. He played his youth hockey with the Crystals organization that won the Montreal city junior championship in 1891 and intermediate championships in 1892 and 1893.\n\nGrant graduated to the senior ranks in 1894 where he made his debut with the Montreal Victorias of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC). He scored one goal in eight games in 1895 and the Victorias, with a record of six wins and two losses, won the AHAC title, and with it, control of the Stanley Cup, emblematic of Canada's senior amateur championship. Grant served as captain of the team.\n\nThe Montreal Victorias were challenged for control of the Stanley Cup by the Winnipeg Victorias in February 1896, and lost the trophy by a 2–0 score in a one-game playoff. Montreal regained the Stanley Cup in December of that year, defeating Winnipeg 6–5. In AHAC play, Grant scored three goals in eight games in both the 1896 and 1897 seasons. He captained the Victorias to a successful defence of the Stanley Cup in 1897 and the team retained the trophy in 1898 by virtue of winning the AHAC title.\n\nThe AHAC disbanded in 1898, and the Victorias moved to the newly formed Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) for the 1899 season. Grant scored two goals in seven games in CAHL play. During the season, Grant and his teammates fielded another Stanley Cup challenge from the Winnipeg Victorias. They retained the trophy following a two-game series; it was Grant's fifth and final Stanley Cup win. Grant was offered a professional contract in New York that was worth the equivalent of $3,500 per year in the earl 1900s, but opted to remain in Montreal. After playing the 1900 CAHL season with the Victorias, he was loaned to the cross-town Montreal Shamrocks in 1901 as an emergency replacement for Frank Tansey. Grant appeared in two league games, and two Stanley Cup challenge games for the team before returning to the Victorias for a final season in 1901.\n\nGrant remained active in hockey following his playing career. He became a referee and officiated several Stanley Cup challenge games. Among them was the 1905 challenge series between the Ottawa Hockey Club and the Rat Portage Thistles. A physical and sometimes violent series, Grant famously wore a hard derby hat while on the ice. Grant later traveled around the United States where he organized demonstrations of the sport and staged exhibition games, making him one of the sport's first ambassadors. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950.\n\nGrant's father, Alex, was a blacksmith and his family's Montreal business dated back to the 1830s. Grant became involved in horse racing through his family's blacksmithing connections and served as a paddock judge for over 40 years. Grant had five children: daughters Dorothy and Reta and sons Graham, Don and Kenny. Don was an original part-owner and chairman of Major League Baseball's New York Mets.\n"}
{"id": "1991724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991724", "title": "Dorylus", "text": "Dorylus\n\nDorylus, also known as driver ants, safari ants, or siafu, is a large genus of army ants found primarily in central and east Africa, although the range also extends to southern Africa and tropical Asia. The term siafu is a loanword from Swahili, and is one of numerous similar words from regional Bantu languages used by indigenous peoples to describe various species of these ants. Unlike the New World members of the former subfamily Ecitoninae (now Dorylinae), members of this genus do form temporary anthills lasting from a few days up to three months. Each colony can contain over 20 million individuals. As with their New World counterparts, there is a soldier class among the workers, which is larger, with a very large head and pincer-like mandibles. They are capable of stinging, but very rarely do so, relying instead on their powerful shearing jaws.\n\nSeasonally, when food supplies become short, they leave the hill and form marching columns of up to 50,000,000 ants, which are considered a menace to people, though they can be easily avoided; a column can only travel about 20 metres in an hour. It is for those unable to move, or when the columns pass through homes, that there is the greatest risk. Their presence is, conversely, beneficial to certain human communities, such as the Maasai, as they perform a pest prevention service in farming communities, consuming the majority of other crop-pests, from insects to large rats. For example, driver ants prey on larvae of the African sugarcane borer, a pest moth in sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nThe characteristic long columns of ants will fiercely defend themselves against anything that attacks them. Columns are arranged with the smaller ants being flanked by the larger soldier ants. These instinctively take up positions as sentries, and set a perimeter corridor through which the smaller ants can run safely. Their bite is severely painful, each soldier leaving two puncture wounds when removed. Removal is difficult, however, as their jaws are extremely strong, and one can pull a soldier ant in two without it releasing its hold. Large numbers of ants can kill small or immobilized animals and eat the flesh. A large part of their diet is earthworms. All \"Dorylus\" species are blind, and, like most varieties of ants, communicate primarily through pheromones.\n\nIn the mating season, alates (winged drones, queens of driver-ant species do not grow wings) are formed. The drones are larger than the soldiers and the queens are even larger. Driver ants do not perform a nuptial flight, but mate on the ground, and the queens go off to establish new colonies. As with most ants, workers and soldiers are sterile females, and so do not reproduce.\n\nMale driver ants, sometimes known as \"sausage flies\" (a term also applied to males of New World ecitonines) due to their bloated, sausage-like abdomens, are among the largest ant morphs, and were originally believed to be members of a different species. Males leave the colony soon after hatching, but are drawn to the scent trail left by a column of siafu once they reach sexual maturity. When a colony of driver ants encounters a male, they tear his wings off and carry him back to the nest to be mated with a virgin queen. As with all ants, the males die shortly afterward. After mating, the queen will lay up to 1,000,000 eggs per month.\n\nSuch is the strength of the ant's jaws that, in East Africa, they are used as natural, emergency sutures. Various East African indigenous tribal peoples (e.g. Maasai moran), when suffering from a gash in the bush, will use the soldiers to stitch the wound by getting the ants to bite on both sides of the gash, then breaking off the body. This use of ants as makeshift surgical staples creates a seal that can hold for days at a time, and the procedure can be repeated, if necessary, allowing natural healing to commence.\n\nSeveral species in this genus carry out raids on termitaria, paralyzing or killing termites and carting them back to the nest.\n\nColonies of driver-ant species have only one queen. When she dies, the surviving workers may try to join another colony, but in other cases, when two colonies of the same driver-ant species meet, they usually change the marching directions to avoid conflicts.\n\n\n"}

As captain of the Tigers in 1925, he led the team on a strike with the demand that the players be paid an additional C$200 to participate in the playoffs. The league refused, suspended the team and sold the organization New York interests. As a member of the Americans, Green scored the first goal in Madison Square Garden history, and after two seasons as a player in New York, coached the team for one before coaching minor league teams for several years. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\nA native of Sudbury, Ontario, Green played senior hockey in his hometown and was a member of the team that won the Northern Ontario senior championship in 1915. He joined the Canadian military in 1916, serving and playing with the 227th Battalion in the Ontario Hockey Association senior division in 1916–17. Deployed overseas in 1917, Green fought in the Battle of Passchendaele where he was a victim of a gas attack.\n\nDischarged from the military in December 1918, Green returned to hockey. He joined the Hamilton Tigers senior team and led them to the 1919 Allan Cup championship before returning home to play four seasons with the Sudbury Wolves of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association. He moved back to Hamilton in 1923 and began his professional career. He played on a line with his brother, \"Red\" Green, and Billy Burch for the last place Tigers. Green was unanimously voted as team captain prior to the start of the 1924–25 NHL season and his skill and physical style in spite of his small stature made him a fan favourite. The Tigers flourished on the ice, finishing as the top team in the NHL, and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.\n\nWhen the players learned that team owners were making large profits on the Tigers despite ownership's claims the team was \"suffering\" financially, Green and Burch led a player's strike against management, demanding a C$200 bonus each or the players would not participate in the playoffs. Team management refused while NHL president Frank Calder warned that if the players did not relent, he would suspend the team and award the fourth-place Ottawa Senators Hamilton's place in the NHL final. The players refused to give in, and as a result, Calder ultimately declared the Montreal Canadiens league champions after they defeated the Toronto St. Patricks in the semi-final and fined each player $200. It was the first player's strike in NHL history.\n\nAdditionally, the strike led to the demise of Hamilton's entry in the NHL as the team and players were sold and became the New York Americans for the 1925–26 season. Many of the players received significant raises following the transfer to New York, including Green who saw his salary rise from $3,000 per season to $5,000. On December 19, 1925, he scored the first goal in Madison Square Garden history before a crowd of 17,000 fans. Late in his second season with the Americans, Green suffered a dislocated kidney during a game and was sent to hospital in critical condition. He recovered, but the injury ended his playing career.\n\nThe Americans named Green their head coach for the 1927–28 NHL season, and finished the season outside of the playoffs with a record of 11–27–6. He left the NHL to coach the Duluth Hornets of the American Hockey Association for three seasons between 1928 and 1931, appearing in three games, and with the Tulsa Oilers in 1931–32.\n\nHe coached the Hamilton Tigers' senior team for one season in 1932–33 before returning to Sudbury where he first opened a men's clothing store and in 1937, founded the Sudbury Golf Club with two partners. He ran the club until his death of cancer in 1960. Green was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.\n"}

The nearest large city is Coari, 192 km SE by east of Tefé.\n\nThe municipal seat of Tefé is the largest town and commercial center of the middle Solimões region. Its population was 61,453 (IBGE 2010) evenly divided between urban and rural, and its area is 23,704 km². There are no roads into Tefé and the only access is by river boat or plane. By fast boat it is about 12 hours from Manaus. TRIP Linhas Aereas operate flights from Manaus to Tefé Airport.\n\nThe city is the home of the Territorial Prelature of Tefé. Tefé is also the major starting point for trips into the Mamiraua Reserve.\n\nThe municipality is in the Juruá-Purus moist forests ecoregion.\nIt contains 46% of the Tefé National Forest, created in 1989.\nThe municipality contains 33.85% of the Catuá-Ipixuna Extractive Reserve, established in 2003 as the first extractive reserve in the state of Amazonas.\n\nAs early as 1620 the Portuguese Carmelites could already boast of converts among the Muras, those natives of the Amazon established around Lake Teffé and on the borders of the neighbouring rivers.\nTefé, also called Ega at one time, was the fourth of eight \"aldeias\" founded by Carmelite missionaries between 1697 and 1751 along the Solimões and Negro Rivers. In 1759 the commandant Joaquim de Mello da Povoas converted the Carmelite \nmission on Lake Tefé into a town, which he named Ega; it was elevated to a city named Tefé in 1855 (but was known as Tefé before that time). The mission, called Parauarí, was originally established on Ilha dos Veados three leagues from the location on the opposite shore of Lake Tefe, called today by the name of Nogueira. It was abandoned due to a smallpox outbreak in the early 18th century and moved across the lake, where it remains today. The survivors were taken to its present site by F. Andre da Costa in 1817. \n\nHenry W. Bates also describes in detail the cultural interactions of the natives with those in the town from his trip in the 1850s.

The station is owned by Tegna Inc. KVUE's studios are located on Steck Avenue just east of Loop 1 in northwest Austin, and its transmitter is located on the West Austin Antenna Farm northwest of downtown Austin.\n\nOn cable, KVUE is available on Charter Spectrum, Suddenlink and Grande Communications channel 3.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 12, 1971, and was originally operated by Center Broadcasting Co. of Center, Texas (owned by Tolbert Foster). The station was the market's first full-time ABC affiliate; prior to KVUE's sign-on, the network's programming had previously been limited to off-hours clearances on KTBC (channel 7), though most of the market could pick up San Antonio's KSAT-TV with a decent antenna. Unlike most network affiliates in then two-station markets, KHFI-TV (channel 42, now KXAN-TV on channel 36) did not take on a secondary affiliation with ABC when that station signed on in February 1965.\n\nUniversal Communications, the broadcasting arm of \"The Detroit News\", purchased KVUE from Center Broadcasting in 1978. The station was acquired by the Gannett Company in 1986 as part of its purchase of \"The Detroit News\". In 1999, Gannett swapped KVUE to Belo Corporation in exchange for KXTV in Sacramento. Previously, Belo had established a Texas-based cable news channel, Texas Cable News (TXCN), a partnership amongst the company's Texas station properties, including KHOU-TV in Houston, WFAA-TV in Dallas and KENS-TV in San Antonio. With the addition of KVUE, TXCN could provide news and information from the four largest cities in Texas. On June 13, 2013, Gannett announced that it would acquire Belo for $1.5 billion. The sale was completed on December 23, which once again put KVUE under Gannett ownership and reunited the station with several of its sister stations for the first time in 14 years, as well as becoming a sister station to KXTV in Sacramento for the first time.\n\nIn 2014, KVUE won a Peabody Award for a documentary entitled \"The Cost of Troubled Minds\", about Texas' underinvestment in addressing mental health care. Specifically honored were film-makers Andy Pierrotti, Derek Rasor, Matt Olsen, Patti C. Smith, Frank Volpicella and Michelle Chism.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KVUE was retained by the latter company, named Tegna.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nKVUE shut down its analog signal on February 17, 2009, as part of the FCC-mandated transition to digital television for full-power stations (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 33, using PSIP to display KVUE's virtual channel as 24 on digital television receivers.\n\nKVUE is the only former Belo-owned ABC affiliate to broadcast its over-the-air signal in 720p (ABC's default HD format).\n\nKVUE is one of the few ABC stations to delay \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"Nightline\" by a half hour on Fridays during high school football season. Syndicated programming seen on KVUE includes \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\". KVUE also broadcast Dr. Red Duke's syndicated medical reports throughout the Austin metro area for much of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nSports programming on KVUE is provided through ESPN on ABC; the station airs any Texas Longhorns football games selected for the network's college football package. This includes the team's national championship victory in 2005.\n\nKVUE-TV presently broadcasts 31 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours on weekdays and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nOn June 1, 2008, KVUE began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

The system includes the Denver Central Library, located in the Golden Triangle district of Downtown Denver, as well as 25 branch locations and two bookmobiles. The library's collection totals more than 2 million items, including books, reference materials, movies, music, and photographs. Of that total, more than 347,000 items are in specific collections including the Western History and Genealogy Department, Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library, and Reference Department holdings.\n\nThe library evolved from the 1878 donation of books to the city's board of education, which were then maintained in a wing of East Denver High School. John Cotton Dana was named chief librarian and the \"Denver Public Library\" was officially established in 1889. The library moved into its own building in 1910, a Greek revival design funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie that was located in Civic Center Park downtown. Between 1913 and 1920, Carnegie also underwrote construction of the library's first eight branches. Previously the city relied on traveling trunks of books.\n\nIn the 1950s the city commissioned the architectural firm Fisher & Fisher and designer Burnham Hoyt to build a new Central Library to be located on Broadway and West 14th Avenue. The property had previously been an auto dealership for the Ford Model T, Model A, and Model B before being condemned by the City in 1953. The Fisher/Hoyt Central Library in the city's Golden Triangle opened in 1956 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. As part of the dedication of the new library when it opened, Yale Library loaned a collection of books that included the 1455 Gutenberg Bible and 1640 Bay Psalm Book that are both rare and valuable artifacts. \nThroughout the 1950s and 1970s, Denver experienced an explosion of growth and quickly required more branches to be open to serve the new neighborhoods that branched out to the southeast and southwest. Among these branches were four Ross branches, funded with a $100,000 donation from Frederick Ross who was a Denver Real Estate Investor and the Library Commissioner. \nIn the 1990s Denver voters approved a $91.6 million bond issue to add onto the Fisher/Hoyt building; the new structure, designed by the 2012 Driehaus Prize winner Michael Graves and the Denver firm of Klipp Colussy Jenks DuBois, opened in 1995. The seven-story exterior is finished with limestone and pre-cast concrete with copper accents throughout. Murals are painted inside by the artist Edward Ruscha and fossils are embedded in its floor within the Schlessman Hall. There is also an art gallery within the Level Five Gates Western History Ready Room. \n\nThe Denver Public Library has a large Western History collection, which began under the direction of City Librarian Malcom G. Wyer and includes 600,000 photographs, 3,700 manuscript archives, 200,000 cataloged books, pamphlets, atlases, maps, and microfilm titles as well as a collection of Western fine art and prints. The quality of its collection of oil paintings rivals that of the Denver Art Museum next door. The library's collection includes western landscape paintings by Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Remington, Charles Marion Russell, Thomas Moran and Otto Kuhler, as well as a portrait of Colorado historian and Denver Post writer Caroline Bancroft.\n\nThe Western History Department holds the Otto Perry collection of railroad photographs, numbering 20,000 negatives from all parts of North America made available for viewing on the Internet.\n\nThe Western History and Genealogy departments merged in 1995 and are located on the fifth floor. The Genealogy department includes 60,000 books, 75,000 pieces of microform, and hundreds of magazine and newsletter titles, charts, clippings, atlases and manuscripts. From 1995 until 2015, The Western History Department worked on digitizing over 100,000 of its images to make them available online. \n\nThe Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library serves as an educational and cultural resource focusing on the history, literature, art, music, religion, and politics of African Americans in Colorado and throughout the Rocky Mountain West. The Library opened in 2003 and houses a full service branch library, research archives and the Western Legacies Museum, an exhibition space that spans more than and includes an African American Leadership Gallery, a replica of the Office of Denver Mayor Wellington E. Webb, and rotating exhibits which highlight historical periods, notable individuals and local Denver history.\n\nAll locations offer patrons access to public computers with Internet service, Microsoft Office 2013, copying, printing, and scanning. Wireless Internet (WiFi) is also available to all visitors.\n\nThe Denver Public Library offers library card holders access to equipment and experiences to check out.

It was originally released in October 1968 as the first album on the Blue Thumb Records label. It was released nearly a year after the band had taken to the studio to record the follow-up to 1967's \"Safe as Milk\". \n\nProducer Bob Krasnow added phasing and reverberation effects to the recordings, which have since been the topic of much discussion among music fans and critics. \n\nThe original intention was to record an album for Buddah Records entitled \"It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper\" (\"Strictly Personal\"'s sleeve design is a relic of this initial concept). A considerable amount of material was recorded for the project during the period of October–November 1967 with Krasnow producing. Buddah, however, declined to release the album, which appeared in revised form the following year. \"Strictly Personal\" features re-recorded versions of songs from the 1967 sessions. \n\nKrasnow's heavy use of phasing and reverberation during mixing was done in accordance with the popular psychedelic rock trends of the day. Beefheart subsequently condemned the production. He said the effects were added without his knowledge or approval. These comments became public only after sales of the album failed to reach expectations. It has been claimed by other band members that he initially agreed to the use of these sounds. Regardless, Beefheart did release his later recordings with a much more basic and unprocessed sound.\n\nBuddah released some recordings from the earlier sessions, along with an earlier version of \"Kandy Korn\", as \"Mirror Man\" in 1971. Much other material from the 1967 sessions has since been released: the compilation \"I May Be Hungry But I Sure Ain't Weird\" (1992) contained eleven of the original cuts taken from master tapes. This album has long since been out of print, but all eleven tracks can be found spread across \"The Mirror Man Sessions\" and the current version of \"Safe as Milk\". Some of these tracks were also used for a vinyl-only release by the Sundazed label in 2008 bearing the original intended title of \"It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper\" but this release does not duplicate the original album's concept or sequence.\n\nBarret Hansen, in a December 1968 review for \"Rolling Stone\", was unsure of the value of the record; he felt that Beefheart and his band had \"the capability of making the ultimate white blues album\", but that the \"noisy, discom-bobulated freakout shit\" and \"liquid audio\" spoil the potential, so that it was unclear to him if the album was the work of \"the world's greatest white bluesman\", \"a competent musician, capable of occasional titanic moments\", or \"a hack performer\" with genius production.\n\nStewart Mason, in a retrospective AllMusic review, felt it was a terrific album but underrated due to the reputation of Bob Krasnow's remixing; although he did feel that the \"sound effects and phasing do detract from the album at points\".\n\nIt was voted number 661 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\nAccording to the album credits, all songs were written by Don Van Vliet. Lyricist Herb Bermann has contested this, claiming to have written the lyrics to the songs \"Safe As Milk\", \"Trust Us,\" \"Gimme Dat Harp Boy,\" and \"Kandy Korn\"\n\n\n\n"}

He claimed that his rule was sufficiently creditable to earn the respect of the settlers and Governor King, although he suffered severe and unexplained financial losses.\n\nIn 1802 he resigned his commission and became a farmer. He had received his first land grant in 1793, and accumulated land at a steady rate at Bankstown, Petersham and Concord. By 1805 he owned 519 sheep, but made no effort to breed from them. He was interested only in meat production, not wool growing.\n\nIn 1802 Rowley was given responsibility for the management of the civil and military barracks and became captain of the Sydney company of the Loyal Association, of which he became commandant in 1804. In the same month he became a magistrate.\n\nHe died of consumption on 27 May 1806, leaving his property to Elizabeth Selwyn, a former convict who had arrived on the \"Pitt\" in 1792, and who was the mother of four of his five children.\n\n\n"}

Her father Antonio Fantoni was from Italy, and her mother was from Croatia. She became famous for playing the title character in the Peruvian telenovela \"Simplemente María\" in 1969. Aside from her telenovela roles, Kamalich starred in several Mexican film productions, including \"Valente Quintero\" (1973), with Antonio Aguilar, Narciso Busquets, and Sara García.\n\nKamalich was born to Antonio Fantoni, an Italian, and his Croatian wife, Maria Kamalich. She first became interested in acting as a young woman when Braulio Castillo, the Puerto Rican actor, went to work in Peru. Kamalich admitted to \"El Vocero\", a newspaper in Puerto Rico, that she had platonic feelings for Castillo. The two would later maintain a lifelong friendship.\n\nLooking for better job opportunities, Kamalich moved to Mexico in 1970, where she had participated in three stage productions, and more importantly in Panamericana's 1969 version of the well-known telenovela (Spanish soap opera), \"Simplemente Maria\". The Peruvian version, was the fourth filmed of Simplemente Maria\", which had already been a hit in Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela.\n\n\"Simplemente Maria\" made Kamalich famous across Latin America, in markets such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, and the aforementioned countries, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Mexico. After, she appeared in a considerable number of telenovelas, usually playing benevolent characters. One exception was her 2005 participation in \"Gitanas\", where she plays a villain. In \"Gitanas\", she had the opportunity to act with Saul Lisazo, who played her son, among other actors.\n\nIn 2005 she also acted in another Telemundo serial, \"Corazón partido\" where she reappeared as villain yet again in the role of \"Virginia Graham\". In 2007 Kamalich participates in another telenovela produced by Telemundo. \"Madre Luna\" which was shot in Colombia, she played the role as a villain. This was the first time in many years that Kamalich left Mexico (where she has resided for over 3 decades) to a foreign country (Colombia) to participate in this telenovela \"(Madre Luna)\". Among the most significant telenovelas are: 1971's \"Rosas Para Veronica\", which was another major hit, \"Mi Rival\" (1973) and \"Amor Prohibido\" (1979), which was also later remade.\n\nAfter the decade of the 1970s was over, Kamalich's telenovela career slowed somewhat. During the 1980s, she participated in ten productions, including 1988's \"Amor en Silencio\" (\"Silently Loving You\"). During the 1990s, her work became even more sporadic, but she did participate in \"Carrusel de las Américas\", which was the sequel of the children's telenovela hit \"Carrusel\", alongside Ludwika Paleta. In 1998, she and Lucía Méndez acted together in \"Tres veces Sofia\" (\"Three Times Sofia\").\n\nKamalich was scheduled to be awarded the for her contributions to acting. She won the prestigious Ariel award for best acting performances in Mexico for best supporting actress in \"Mariana\". Apart from that, she made a film, \"Simplemente Maria\", based on the successful telenovela. In 2012, she was to Berenice del Toro in \"La Mujer de Judas (2012)\" but did not show up on the first day of shooting due to health problems. She was replaced by Marta Verduzco. Later that year, she was set to come back with \"La Otra Cara del Alma\".\n\nSaby Kamalich died on 13 September 2017 at the age of 78.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1991795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991795", "title": "Lophius", "text": "Lophius\n\nMembers of the genus Lophius, also sometimes called monkfish, fishing-frogs, frog-fish, and sea-devils, are various species of lophiid anglerfishes found in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. \"Lophius\" is known as the \"monk\" or \"monkfish\" to the North Sea fishermen, a name which also belongs to \"Squatina squatina\", the angelshark, a type of shark. The North European species is \"Lophius piscatorius\", and the Mediterranean species is \"Lophius budegassa\".\n\nThe seven recognized extant species in this genus are:\n\n\nThe head is large, broad, flat, and depressed, with the remainder of the body appearing merely like an appendage. The wide mouth extends all around the anterior circumference of the head, and both jaws are armed with bands of long, pointed teeth, which are inclined inwards, and can be temporarily depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, while still preventing its escape from the mouth. The pectoral and ventral fins are so articulated as to perform the functions of feet, the fish being enabled to walk on the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in the sand or amongst seaweed. All around its head and also along the body, the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of seaweed. These structures, combined with the ability to change the colour of the body to match its surroundings, assists the fish greatly in concealing itself in its lurking places, which are selected for their abundance of prey. \n\nSpecies of \"Lophius\" have three long filaments sprouting from the middle of their heads; these are the detached and modified three first spines of the anterior dorsal fin. As with all Anglerfish species, the longest filament is the first, which terminates in an irregular growth of flesh, the esca (also referred to as the illicium), and is movable in all directions; this modified fin ray is used as a lure to attract other fish, which the monkfish then seize with their enormous jaws, devouring them whole. Whether the prey has been attracted to the lure or not is not strictly relevant, as the action of the jaws is an automatic reflex triggered by contact with the esca.\n\nMonkfish, like most anglerfish, are also characterised by an enormously distensible stomach, which allows an individual monkfish to fully swallow prey as large as itself. Monkfish grow to a length of more than ; specimens of are common.\n\nThe spawn of this genus consists of a thin sheet of transparent gelatinous material wide and in length. The eggs in this sheet are in a single layer, each in its own little cavity. The spawn is free in the sea. The larvae are free-swimming and have the pelvic fins with elongated filaments.\n\nThe East Atlantic species is found along the coasts of Europe, but becomes scarce beyond 60°N latitude; it occurs also on the coasts of the Cape of Good Hope. The species caught on the North American side of the Atlantic is usually \"Lophius americanus\". A third species (\"Lophius budegassa\"), inhabits the Mediterranean, and a fourth (\"L. setigerus\") the coasts of China and Japan.\n\nThe black (\"L. budegassa\") and white (\"L. piscatorius\") anglerfish both live in shallow, inshore waters from to deeper waters (greater than ). These two species are very similar to one another with only a few distinctions between them. These include: the colour of the peritoneum (black for \"L. budegassa\" and white for \"L. piscatorius\") and the number of rays in the second dorsal fin (\"L. budegassa\", 9–10 and \"L. piscatorius\", 11–12). Also, minor differences in their distribution occur. Black anglerfish tend to have a more southern distribution (Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic from the British Isles to Senegal), whereas the white anglerfish are distributed further north, (Mediterranean, Black Sea and eastern North Atlantic from the Barents Sea to the Strait of Gibraltar). Despite these differences, the overall distribution of the black and white anglerfish tend to overlap greatly. A map of the distribution of anglerfish in the waters surrounding Europe and North Africa can be found in the external links section. The movements of both species of anglerfish indicate a mixing of both northern and southern species could have strong implications for the geographical boundaries of the stocks from a management perspective. Both species of \"Lophius\" are important because they are commercially valuable species usually caught by trawl and gillnetting fleets.\n\nConcern is expressed over the sustainability of monkfish fishing. The method most commonly used to catch monkfish, beam trawling, has been described as damaging to seafloor habitats. In February 2007, the British supermarket chain Asda banned monkfish from their stores.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1991808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991808", "title": "Water fluoridation controversy", "text": "Water fluoridation controversy\n\nThe water fluoridation controversy arises from political, moral, ethical, economic, and health considerations regarding the fluoridation of public water supplies.\n\nFor deprived groups in both maturing and matured countries, international and national agencies and dental associations across the world support the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation. Proponents of water fluoridation see it as a question of public health policy and equate the issue to vaccination and food fortification, claiming significant benefits to dental health and minimal risks.\n\nIn contrast, opponents of water fluoridation view it as an infringement of individual rights, if not an outright violation of medical ethics, on the basis that individuals have no choice in the water that they drink, unless they drink more expensive bottled water. A small minority of scientists have challenged the medical consensus, variously claiming that water fluoridation has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and is pharmacologically obsolete.\n\nOpposition to fluoridation has existed since its initiation in the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, conspiracy theorists claimed that fluoridation was a communist plot to undermine American public health. In recent years water fluoridation has become a prevalent health and political issue in many countries, resulting in some countries and communities discontinuing its use while others have expanded it. The controversy is propelled by a significant public opposition supported by a minority of professionals, which include researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners, health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly Christian Scientists in the U.S.), and occasionally consumer groups and environmentalists. Organized political opposition has come from libertarians, the John Birch Society, and from groups like the Green parties in the UK and New Zealand.\n\nProponents and opponents have been both criticized for overstating the benefits or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited the lack of high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.\n\nPublic water fluoridation was first practiced in 1945, in the US. As of 2012, 25 countries have supplemental water fluoridation to varying degrees, and 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them there are areas where fluoride is above the optimum level. As of 2012 about 435 million people worldwide received water fluoridated at the recommended level, of whom 57 million (13%) received naturally fluoridated water and 377 million (87%) received artificially fluoridated water. In 2014, three-quarters of the US population on the public water supply received fluoridated water, which represented two-thirds of the total US population.\n\nNational and international health agencies and dental associations throughout the world have endorsed water fluoridation as safe and effective.\n\nThe views on the most effective method for community prevention of tooth decay are mixed. The Australian government states that water fluoridation is the most effective means of achieving fluoride exposure that is community-wide. The World Health Organization states water fluoridation, when feasible and culturally acceptable, has substantial advantages, especially for subgroups at high risk, while the European Commission finds no advantage to water fluoridation compared with topical use.\n\nFDI World Dental Federation supports water fluoridation as safe and effective. the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry, and the national dental associations of Australia, Canada, and the U.S. The American Dental Association calls water fluoridation \"one of the safest and most beneficial, cost-effective public health measures for preventing, controlling, and in some cases reversing, tooth decay.\"\n\nIn the English speaking nations—the United States, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand, all of which practice water fluoridation—many medical associations and authorities have published position statements and endorsed water fluoridation.\n\nThe U.S. Surgeon General, the American Public Health Association, the Royal Commission on the National Health Service, Australian Medical Association, New Zealand Medical Association, Health Canada supports fluoridation, citing a number of international scientific reviews that indicate \"there is no link between any adverse health effects and exposure to fluoride in drinking water at levels that are below the maximum acceptable concentration of 1.5 mg/L.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed water fluoridation as one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century in the U.S., along with vaccination, family planning, recognition of the dangers of smoking, and other achievements.\n\nIn Israel, the Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians, the Israel Pediatric Association, and the Israel Dental Association, support fluoridation.\n\nThe World Health Organization, looking at global public health, identifies fluoride as one of a few chemicals for which the contribution from drinking-water to overall intake is an important factor in preventing disease. This is because there is clear evidence that optimal concentrations of fluoride provide protection against cavities, both in children and in adults.\n\nThe scientists or doctors who oppose water fluoridation argue that it has no or little cariostatic benefits, may cause serious health problems, is not effective enough to justify the costs, and is pharmacologically obsolete. Arvid Carlsson has argued that fluoridation violates modern pharmacological principles and doesn't take into account individual variations in response, which can be considerable even when the dosage is fixed. Paul Connett has stated \"It’s politics that is interfering with science in this issue...It’s a matter of political will, and you cannot change political will if you don’t get the people. We must involve the people.\".\n\nProponents and opponents have been both criticized for overstating the benefits or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited the lack of high-quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. A 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy. John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding the source of the controversy: \"In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. I mean, when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says this is one of the 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the studies that have been done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering how long this [fluoridation] has been going on. I think that’s why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began. In the face of ignorance, controversy is rampant.\"\n\nFluoride can be present naturally in water at concentrations well above recommended levels, which can have several long-term adverse effects, including severe dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, and weakened bones. In 1984 the World Health Organization recommended a guideline maximum fluoride value of 1.5 mg/L as a level at which fluorosis should be minimal, reaffirming it in 2006.\n\nFluoridation has little effect on risk of bone fracture (broken bones); it may result in slightly lower fracture risk than either excessively high levels of fluoridation or no fluoridation. There is no clear association between fluoridation and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma.\n\nIn rare cases improper implementation of water fluoridation can result in overfluoridation that causes outbreaks of acute fluoride poisoning, with symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Three such outbreaks were reported in the U.S. between 1991 and 1998, caused by fluoride concentrations as high as 220 mg/L; in the 1992 Alaska outbreak, 262 people became ill and one person died. In 2010, approximately 60 gallons of fluoride were released into the water supply in Asheboro, North Carolina in 90 minutes—an amount that was intended to be released in a 24-hour period.\n\nLike other common water additives such as chlorine, hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride decrease pH and cause a small increase of corrosivity, but this problem is easily addressed by increasing the pH. Although it has been hypothesized that hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluoride might increase human lead uptake from water, a 2006 statistical analysis did not support concerns that these chemicals cause higher blood lead concentrations in children. Trace levels of arsenic and lead may be present in fluoride compounds added to water; however, concentrations are below measurement limits.\n\nThe effect of water fluoridation on the natural environment has been investigated, and no adverse effects have been established. Issues studied have included fluoride concentrations in groundwater and downstream rivers; lawns, gardens, and plants; consumption of plants grown in fluoridated water; air emissions; and equipment noise.\n\nReviews have shown that water fluoridation reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.\n\nA 2000 UK systematic review (York) found that water fluoridation was associated with a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25 teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences. A 2002 systematic review found strong evidence that water fluoridation is effective at reducing overall tooth decay in communities. A 2015 Cochrane review also found benefit in children.\n\nFluoride may also prevent cavities in adults of all ages. A 2007 meta-analysis by CDC researchers found that water fluoridation prevented an estimated 27% of cavities in adults, about the same fraction as prevented by exposure to any delivery method of fluoride (29% average). A 2011 European Commission review found that the benefits of water fluoridation for adult in terms of reductions in decay are limited. 2015 Cochrane review found no conclusive research in adults.\n\nMost countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation. For example, in Finland and Germany, tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped. Fluoridation may be useful in the U.S. because unlike most European countries, the U.S. does not have school-based dental care, many children do not visit a dentist regularly, and for many U.S. children water fluoridation is the prime source of exposure to fluoride. The effectiveness of water fluoridation can vary according to circumstances such as whether preventive dental care is free to all children.\n\nWater fluoridation pits the common good against individual rights. Some say the common good overrides individual rights, and equate it to vaccination and food fortification. Others say that individual rights override the common good, and say that individuals have no choice in the water that they drink, unless they drink more expensive bottled water, and some argue unequivocally that it does not stand up to scrutiny relative to the Nuremberg Code and other codes of medical ethics.\n\nThose who emphasize the public good emphasize the medical consensus that appropriate levels of water fluoridation are safe and effective to prevent cavities and see it as a public health intervention, replicating the benefits of naturally fluoridated water, which can free people from the misery and expense of tooth decay and toothache, with the greatest benefit accruing to those least able to help themselves. This perspective suggests it would be unethical to withhold such treatment. In her book \"50 Health Scares That Fizzled\", Joan Callahan writes that, \"For lower-income people with no insurance, fluoridated water (like enriched flour and fortified milk) looks more like a free preventative health measure that a few elitists are trying to take away.\"\n\nThose who emphasize individual or local choice, may view fluoridation as a violation of ethical or legal rules that prohibit medical treatment without medical supervision or informed consent or that prohibit administration of unlicensed medical substances, view it as \"mass medication\", or may even characterize it as a violation of the Nuremberg Code and the Council of Europe's Biomedical Convention of 1999. Another journal article suggested applying the precautionary principle to this controversy, which calls for public policy to reflect a conservative approach to minimize risk in the setting where harm is possible (but not necessarily confirmed) and where the science is not settled. Others have opposed it on the grounds of potential financial conflicts of interest driven by the chemical industry.\n\nA 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report reached a conclusion mainly on three points, stating that :\nThe report therefore concluded that local and regional democratic procedures are the most appropriate way to decide whether to fluoridate.\n\nThe controversy is propelled by a significant public opposition supported by a minority of professionals, including researchers, dental and medical professionals, alternative medical practitioners such as chiropractors, health food enthusiasts, a few religious groups (mostly Christian Scientists in the U.S.), and occasionally consumer groups and environmentalists. Organized political opposition has come from libertarians, the John Birch Society, and from groups like the Green parties in the UK and New Zealand.\n\nOpposition campaigns involve newspaper articles, talk radio, and public forums. Media reporters are often poorly equipped to explain the scientific issues, and are motivated to present controversy regardless of the underlying scientific merits. Websites, which are increasingly used by the public for health information, contain a wide range of material about fluoridation ranging from factual to fraudulent, with a disproportionate percentage opposed to fluoridation. Antifluoridationist literature links fluoride exposure to a wide variety of effects, including AIDS, allergy, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, cancer, and low IQ, along with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, pineal gland, and thyroid.\n\nMany people do not know that fluoridation is meant to prevent tooth decay, or that natural or bottled water can contain fluoride. As fluoridation does not appear to be an important issue for the general public in the U.S., the debate may reflect an argument between two relatively small lobbies for and against fluoridation.\n\nA survey of Australians in 2009 found that 70% supported and 15% opposed fluoridation. Those opposed were much more likely to score higher on outrage factors such as \"unclear benefits\".\n\nA study of focus groups from 16 European countries in 2003 found that fluoridation was opposed by a majority of focus group members in most of the countries, including France, Germany, and the UK.\n\nA survey in Sheffield, UK performed in 1999 found that while a 62% majority favored water fluoridation in the city, the 31% who were opposed expressed their preference with greater intensity than supporters.\n\nEvery year in the U.S., pro- and anti-fluoridationists face off in referenda or other public decision-making processes: in most of them, fluoridation is rejected.\n\nDespite support by public health organizations and authorities, the practice is controversial as a public health measure; some countries and communities have discontinued it, while others have expanded it.\n\nIn the U.S., rejection in state and local communities is more likely when the decision is made by a public referendum; in Europe, most decisions against fluoridation have been made administratively. Neither side of the dispute appears to be weakening or willing to concede.\n\nWater fluoridation is used in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Israel, Hong Kong and a handful of other countries. The following nations previously fluoridated their water, but stopped the practice, with the years when water fluoridation started and stopped in parentheses:\n\nIn the United Kingdom a strategic health authority can direct a water company to fluoridate the water supply in an area if it is technically possible. The strategic health authority must consult with the local community and businesses in the affected area. The water company will act as a contractor in any new schemes and cannot refuse to fluoridate the supply.\n\nIn areas with complex water sources, water fluoridation is more difficult and more costly. Alternative fluoridation methods have been proposed, and implemented in some parts of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently assessing the effects of fluoridated toothpaste, milk fluoridation and salt fluoridation in Africa, Asia, and Europe. The WHO supports fluoridation of water in some areas. In some other countries, sodium fluoride is added to table salt.\n\nAs of 2012, 25 countries have artificial water fluoridation to varying degrees, 11 of them have more than 50% of their population drinking fluoridated water. A further 28 countries have water that is naturally fluoridated, though in many of them the fluoride is above the optimum level. As of 2012 about 435 million people worldwide received water fluoridated at the recommended level, about 211 million of them living in the United States.\n\nFluoridation began during a time of great optimism and faith in science and experts (the 1950s and 1960s), but even then, the public frequently objected. Opponents drew on distrust of experts and unease about medicine and science. Controversies include disputes over fluoridation's benefits and the strength of the evidence basis for these benefits, the difficulty of identifying harms, legal issues over whether water fluoride is a medicine, and the ethics of mass intervention.\n\nThe first large fluoridation controversy occurred in Wisconsin in 1950. Fluoridation opponents questioned the ethics, safety, and efficacy of fluoridation. New Zealand was the second country to fluoridate, and similar controversies arose there. Fears about fluoride were likely exacerbated by the reputation of fluoride compounds as insect poisons and by early literature which tended to use terms such as \"toxic\" and \"low grade chronic fluoride poisoning\" to describe mottling from consumption of 6 mg/L of fluoride prior to tooth eruption, a level of consumption not expected to occur under controlled fluoridation. When voted upon, the outcomes tend to be negative, and thus fluoridation has had a history of gaining through administrative orders in North America.\n\nConspiracy theories involving fluoridation are common, and include claims that fluoridation was motivated by protecting the U.S. atomic bomb program from litigation, that (as famously parodied in the film \"Dr. Strangelove,\" where a deranged U.S. Air Force general claimed that it would \"sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids\") it is part of a Communist or New World Order plot to take over the world, that it was pioneered by a German chemical company to make people submissive to those in power, that behind the scenes it is promoted by the sugary food or phosphate fertilizer or aluminium industries, or that it is a smokescreen to cover failure to provide dental care to the poor. One such theory is that fluoridation was a public-relations ruse sponsored by fluoride polluters such as the aluminium maker Alcoa and the Manhattan Project, with conspirators that included industrialist Andrew Mellon and the Mellon Institute's researcher Gerald J. Cox, the Kettering Laboratory of the University of Cincinnati, the Federal Security Agency's administrator Oscar R. Ewing, and public-relations strategist Edward Bernays. Specific antifluoridation arguments change to match the spirit of the time.\n\nOutside North America, water fluoridation was adopted in some European countries, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Denmark and Sweden banned fluoridation when government panels found insufficient evidence of safety, and the Netherlands banned water fluoridation when \"a group of medical practitioners presented evidence\" that it caused negative effects in a percentage of the population.\n\nWater fluoridation has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories. During the \"Red Scare\" in the United States during the late 1940s and 1950s, and to a lesser extent in the 1960s, activists on the far right of American politics routinely asserted that fluoridation was part of a far-reaching plot to impose a socialist or communist regime. These opponents believed it was \"another aspect of President Truman's drive to socialize medicine.\" They also opposed other public health programs, notably mass vaccination and mental health services. Their views were influenced by opposition to a number of major social and political changes that had happened in recent years: the growth of internationalism, particularly the UN and its programs; the introduction of social welfare provisions, particularly the various programs established by the New Deal; and government efforts to reduce perceived inequalities in the social structure of the United States.\n\nOthers asserted the existence of \"a Communist plot to deplete the brainpower and sap the strength of a generation of American children\". Dr. Charles Bett, a prominent anti-fluoridationist, charged that fluoridation was \"better than using the atom bomb because the atom bomb has to be made, has to be transported to the place it is to be set off while poisonous fluorine has been placed right beside the water supplies by the Americans themselves ready to be dumped into the water mains whenever a Communist desires!\" Similarly, a right-wing newsletter, the \"American Capsule News\", claimed that \"the Soviet General Staff is very happy about it. Anytime they get ready to strike, and their 5th column takes over, there are tons and tons of this poison \"standing by\" municipal and military water systems ready to be poured in within 15 minutes.\"\n\nThis controversy had a direct impact on local program during the 1950s and 1960s, where referendums on introducing fluoridation were defeated in over a thousand Florida communities. It was not until as late as the 1990s that fluoridated water was consumed by the majority of the population of the United States.\n\nThe communist conspiracy argument declined in influence by the mid-1960s, becoming associated in the public mind with irrational fear and paranoia. It was portrayed in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film \"Dr. Strangelove\", in which the character General Jack D. Ripper initiates a nuclear war in the hope of thwarting a communist plot to \"sap and impurify\" the \"precious bodily fluids\" of the American people with fluoridated water. Another satire appeared in the 1967 movie \"In Like Flint\", in which a character's fear of fluoridation is used to indicate that he is insane.\n\nSome anti-fluoridationists claimed that the conspiracy theories were damaging their goals; Dr. Frederick Exner, an anti-fluoridation campaigner in the early 1960s, told a conference: \"most people are not prepared to believe that fluoridation is a communist plot, and if you say it is, you are successfully ridiculed by the promoters. It is being done, effectively, every day ... some of the people on our side are the fluoridators' 'fifth column'.\"\n\nIn 1987, Ian E. Stephens authored a self-published booklet, an extract of which was published in the Australian New Age publication Nexus Magazine in 1995. In it he claimed he was told by \"Charles Elliot Perkins\" that: \"Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him ... Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile.\" These statements have been dismissed by reputable Holocaust historians as untrue, but they are regularly repeated to the present day in conspiracy publications and websites.\n\nIn 2004, on the U.S. television program \"Democracy Now\", investigative journalist and author of the book \"The Fluoride Deception\", Christopher Bryson claimed that, \"the post-war campaign to fluoridate drinking water was less a public health innovation than a public relations ploy sponsored by industrial users of fluoride—including the government's nuclear weapons program.\"\n\nU.S. opponents of fluoridation were heartened by a 2006 National Research Council report about hazards of water naturally fluoridated to high levels; the report recommended lowering the U.S. maximum limit of 4 mg/L for fluoride in drinking water.\n\nWater was fluoridated in large parts of the Netherlands from 1960 to 1973, at which point the Supreme Court of the Netherlands declared fluoridation of drinking water unauthorized. The Dutch Court decided that authorities had no legal basis for adding chemicals to drinking water if they did not also improve safety. It was also stated as support that consumers cannot choose a different tap water provider. Drinking water has not been fluoridated in any part of the Netherlands since 1973.\n\nIn \"Ryan v. Attorney General\" (1965), the Supreme Court of Ireland held that water fluoridation did not infringe the plaintiff's right to bodily integrity. The court found that such a right to bodily integrity did exist, despite the fact that it was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of Ireland, thus establishing the doctrine of unenumerated rights in Irish constitutional law.\n\nFluoridation has been the subject of many court cases wherein activists have sued municipalities, asserting that their rights to consent to medical treatment and due process are infringed by mandatory water fluoridation. Individuals have sued municipalities for a number of illnesses that they believe were caused by fluoridation of the city's water supply. In most of these cases, the courts have held in favor of cities, finding no or only a tenuous connection between health problems and widespread water fluoridation. To date, no federal appellate court or state court of last resort (i.e., state supreme court) has found water fluoridation to be unlawful.\n\n\n\n"}

The screenwriter Ben Hecht worked on the film's script, but is not credited. The film was partly shot on location in New York City.\n\nSiodmak later said \"I thought it was good but it's not really my kind of film: I hate locations - there's so much you can't control.\"\n\nMartin Rome (Richard Conte), a hardened criminal, is recuperating in a hospital from a shootout where he killed a police officer. At the hospital, he is secretly visited by his fiancée, Teena Ricante (played by 15-year old Debra Paget). A shady lawyer arrives in Rome's room. Niles (Berry Kroeger), is representing another crook who is being held for a jewel robbery during which a woman was tortured and murdered. Niles attempts to coerce Rome into confessing to this robbery, supposedly in exchange for a deal which would see him escape the electric chair. Niles threatens to harm Teena, Rome reacts by trying to strangle the lawyer. Later, in order to protect Teena from both Niles and the police, who are searching for her in relation to the robbery, Rome charms his nurse, Miss Pruett (Betty Garde), into providing the girl a hiding place: Pruett's own apartment.\n\nAfter being transferred to the prison's hospital ward, Rome secures the help of a trustee (Walter Baldwin), to help him escape. He goes to Niles' office and demands money to allow he and Teena to get away. When Rome forces the lawyer to open the safe, he discovers the stolen jewels and makes Niles confess that the woman accomplice in the murder/robbery was a surly, heavy-set masseuse named Rose Givens (Hope Emerson). When Niles goes for a gun, Rome knifes him to death and takes the jewels, concealing them in a locker in a subway station.\n\nRome is being pursued by police lieutenant Candella (Victor Mature), and his partner, Lieutenant Collins (Fred Clark). Candella knows Rome's family well, having grown up in the neighborhood. Rome, feverish from his bullet wounds and exceedingly tired, goes to his parents' apartment seeking his mother's help. His teenage brother, Tony, himself skirts the law assisting the brother he worships. Their mother tells Rome he must leave; while she is preparing him some food, Candella shows up. He suspects Rome is hiding in the apartment and tells the woman, whom he calls 'Mama', he must search. Rome and Tony appear; Rome holds a gun on Candella, Tony makes sure the coast is clear and Rome escapes. Afterwards, Candella tells Tony to sit down for a talk.\n\nRome uses an old girlfriend, Brenda (Shelley Winters), to track down Rose Givens' address. His injuries are causing him to weaken so badly that she enlists an unlicensed foreign doctor to attend to him in her car. The doctor administers enough care, for $200, to temporarily revive Rome. Brenda finally drops him off at Rose Givens' address. There, Rome makes a deal with Rose to give her the jewels for \"five-thousand dollars, a car, a way out of the country and a good night's sleep\".\n\nCandella becomes more obsessive about his pursuit of Rome. He and his partner stay up all night considering the case. The next morning at the station, the two talk to the trustee from the prison, the man who was in charge of the hospital ward when Rome escaped, and a group of foreign doctors. The doctor who treated Rome is among them and, when Candella discovers the $200 in the man's wallet, he confesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Rose has set out to secure the funds and to make the travel arrangements for Rome. He telephones Candella at the police station to inform them that Rose will be on the subway platform retrieving the jewels from the locker. He makes the mistake of assuming he would be in possession of the money and the tickets before she opens the locker, but Rose makes it clear she will not hand those over until she has the jewels. As she takes them from the locker, she is apprehended. She struggles and manages to fire her gun, aiming for Rome; instead she hits Candella in the shoulder.\n\nCandella flees the hospital and goes to Miss Pruett's apartment, knowing that she is the only one who could know where Teena is. Pruett tells him that Rome summoned Teena to meet him at a church. Outside the church, Rome meets Tony and, because he did not receive the money from Rose, orders the boy to go home, steal their parents' savings and return with it as fast as possible. Tony cannot bring himself to do this and seems to have decided to break with his brother's criminality.\n\nInside the church, Teena informs Rome she will not go away with him. As he tries to smooth-talk Teena into changing her mind, Candella arrives and fills the girl in on all the human wreckage Rome has left behind him. Teena leaves.\n\nAs the two men leave the church, Rome takes advantage of Candella's gunshot wound and makes to escape along the street. Candella shoots and kills him. In the aftermath, Tony breaks down and cries after helping Candella into a police car. The police lieutenant consoles the boy.\n\n\nDirector Robert Siodmak was loaned from Universal for this motion picture. Filming took place on location in New York originally under the title \"Law and Martin Rome\".\n\nAt the time the film was released, \"The New York Times\" praised \"Cry of the City\" as \"taut and grimly realistic\". The review praised the performances as \"thoroughly effective\", and said that \"Victor Mature, an actor once suspected of limited talents, turns in a thoroughly satisfying job as the sincere and kindly cop, who not only knows his business but the kind of people he is tracking down.\"\n\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine liked the film and wrote, \"The hard-hitting suspense of the chase formula is given topnotch presentation in \"Cry of the City\". It's an exciting motion picture, credibly put together to wring out every bit of strong action and tension inherent in such a plot. Robert Siodmak's penchant for shaping melodramatic excitement that gets through to an audience is realistically carried out in this one.\"\n\nThe film has been highly praised by modern critics, and is viewed as an important example of the film noir genre. The \"Time Out Film Guide\" praises the realistic look and feel of the city: \"Rarely has the cruel, lived-in squalor of the city been presented in such telling detail, both in the vivid portrayal of ghetto life and in the astonishing parade of corruption uncovered in the night (a slug-like shyster; a monstrous, sadistic masseuse; a sleazy refugee abortionist, etc).\"\n\nIn \"Film Noir: The Dark Side of the Screen\", Foster Hirsch said that Siodmak's characters \"are nurtured by their obsessions\". The Candela character, \"as Colin McArthur notes in \"Underworld USA\", 'hunts his quarry with an almost metaphysical hatred'.\"\n\nHirsch describes Rome's innocence in the jewel robbery, despite his criminal background, as an \"ironic variation on the wrong man theme\" of some film noir movies. \"Branded for a crime he did not commit, the Conte character becomes a true criminal, enmeshed in a web from which there is no escape.\"\n\nThe musical score of the film is Alfred Newman's \"Street Scene\", which had debuted in a 1931 movie of the same name and became iconic in big-city gangster pictures produced during that era.\n\n\n"}

In 2002, the Argos seemed to turn it around, and made it to the East final only to lose to Montreal. In his second tenure with the Argonauts, O'Shea was an important component of the Argonauts' strong defence. In 2004, O'Shea helped lead the Argos to the 2004 Grey Cup Championship, beating the B.C. Lions 27-19, winning his 3rd Grey Cup, all with the Argonauts.\n\nAgainst the Saskatchewan Roughriders on October 20, 2006, he became the first Canadian and third player in CFL history to record 1000 career tackles. In 2007, he was voted as the middle linebacker on the All-Time Argos Team. O'Shea was released by the Argonauts on February 27, 2009. He finished his career with the second most games played by an Argonaut with 205, 17 games behind former linebacker Don Moen.\n\nBased on his playing career, he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nO'Shea was hired by the Toronto Argonauts as their special teams coordinator for the 2010 season.

{"id": "1991879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991879", "title": "Ndlovukati", "text": "Ndlovukati\n\nNdlovukati (literally, \"She-Elephant\", pl. \"tiNdlovukati\"; also spelled \"Indlovukazi\") is the Siswati title for the female monarch of Eswatini and is roughly equivalent to a Queen Mother or Senior Queen in other countries. The title is given preferentially to the mother of the reigning King (styled the \"Ngwenyama\", \"Lion of Swaziland\"), or to another female royal of high status if the King's mother has died. Indlovukati rules alongside the Ngwenyama, and when there is no King, she rules as a Queen Regent. The current Ndlovukati is Queen Ntombi Tfwala, the mother of Ngwenyama Mswati III and wife of Sobhuza II. She was also Queen Regent from 1983 until 1986 when Mswati became King. The most notable Queen Regent was Ndlovukati Labotsibeni Mdluli who ruled Swaziland from 1899 until 1921 when she abdicated for Sobhuza II.\n\nThe Ndlovukati is traditionally joint monarch of Eswatini with the King. The king is seen as the administrative head of state, while she is seen as the spiritual and national head of state. Several of the Ndlovukati's functions are to control important ritual substances (sometimes called medicines) and knowledge necessary for inaugurating of the rule of a Ngwenyama, rainmaking, and the annual renewal of national and kingly strength in the incwala rites. The Ndlovukati also leads the nation as Queen Regent following a King's death and during the youth of a crown prince. Other notable Tindlovukati are Tsandzile Ndwandwe, Lojiba Simelane, Tibati Nkambule, and Labotsibeni Mdluli from nineteenth century Swaziland.\n\nHistorically, there have been a number of Ndlovukati with great substantial power as well as influence, especially (though not exclusively) in periods of regency. The power of the Ndlovukati was explicitly understood as a counterweight to that of the Ngwenyama and also to potentially rival royal princes. This was the case especially during the reign of Mswati II and Tsandzile Ndwandwe. Like royal governors who were not from the royal Dlamini dynasty, the Ndlovukati could not accede to the throne, thus offering an alternative source of power to rein in overweaning \"Tingwenyama\" who could not challenge directly to be the Ngwenyama.\n\nDuring the long reign of Sobhuza II (1899-1982), his grandmother Ndlovukati Labotsibeni Mdluli (also known as \"Gwamile\") was the last great bearer of the title, being the primary Swazi political power from Sobhuza's accession as an infant in 1899 until his accession to full power in 1922. However, over the following 60 years the practical power and influence of the office of \"ndlovukati\" became greatly overshadowed, in part because the British chose to recognize the powers of the king (whom they called the \"Paramount Chief\") over those of the senior, in part because of the force of Sobhuza's personality in contrast to the \"tindlovukati\" who succeeded his own mother after she died in 1938, and in part because of conservative aristocratic Swazi male reactions to colonialism, which created a new and more rigid form of patriarchy now called and argued by some to be mischaracterised as \"traditional\". The office of \"Ndlovukati\" suffered a further blow after the death of Sobhuza II, when a holder of the office was implicated in the political machinations of Prince Mfanasibili aimed at usurping the kingship. Thus the political-cultural ideals and historical meanings of the office expressed above do not really characterise the \"Ndlovukati\" today, whose position has become much weaker than that of the \"Ngwenyama\".\n\nAt any time where there is both an \"Ingwenyama\" and an \"Indlovukati\", which is most of the time, there are two royal villages. Even during a regency when the king is a minor, a proto-form of his headquarters is prepared. The King's headquarters is where he carries out his administrative duties; the \"Ndlovukati\"'s, which is called \"umphakatsi,\" (meaning \"the inside,\" and a term also applied to the royal insiders and close allies as a group) is the national capital and spiritual and ceremonial home of the nation. The king resides at his own royal village or kraal called \"lilawu\". The present umphakatsi is at Ludzidzini Royal Kraal and lilawu is at Ngabezweni Royal Kraal.\n\n"}

It is part of the Hilton Hotels & Resorts chain and has a history dating back to 1908. The hotel was originally established by William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor, a member of the prominent Astor family. The hotel features 298 guest rooms, including 19 suites.\n\nThe Waldorf, London, opened in 1908 with a vision to follow the American tradition of offering not just rooms but a place for passers-by to stop for dinner, afternoon tea or a drink. It opened with 400 bedrooms, 176 bathrooms and a range of innovative features – a telephone and electric lights that could be switched off at the bedside in all rooms, three elevators and central heating.\n\n1889 – Theatrical impresario Edward Sanders decided to build a major West End hotel on the northern rim of Aldwych. Sanders partnered with accountant Thomas Wild to raise the sum of £700,000, with the assistance of William Waldorf Astor, whom the hotel was named after in gratitude.\n\n1908 – Employing a steel girder structure, the hotel was erected in only 18 months and opened on 28 January with a champagne reception.\n\n1913 – The first of many tangos was performed in the Palm Court, scandalising Edwardian society.\n\n1934 – The resident house band was led by Howard Godfrey and his Waldorfians. Godfrey recorded 15 \"Live at the Waldorf\" 78 rpm discs with singer Al Bowlly. Hits included \"Love is the Sweetest Thing\" and \"Goodnight, Sweetheart\".\n\n1939 – During WWII the Waldorf placed adverts in the press reassuring visitors that its alloy structure made it safe. One stray bomb missed the hotel but shockwaves shattered the Palm Court roof and tango tea dances were suspended. The restaurant became a staff dormitory and the hotel's legendary head waiter slept in a corner every night to keep an eye on it.\n\n1958 – Scenes from the \"Titanic\" film \"A Night to Remember\" were shot in the Palm Court as director Roy Ward Baker thought the Palm Court Lounge ideal for depicting the interior of a ship.\n\n1964 – Egon Ronay launched his hotel guides at the Waldorf.\n\n1969 – \"Melody Maker\" hosted its music awards ceremony at the Waldorf.\n\n1982 – The Waldorf held its first Tango Teas since 1939.\n\n1995 – The Meridien hotel group took over from the Forte family.\n\n2004 – Hilton Hotels Corporation took over the hotel and renamed it The Waldorf Hilton.\n\n2005 – The Waldorf was given a £35 million refurbishment.\n\n2015 – The Waldorf Hilton received a further £13.5 million refurbishment.\n\nThe Waldorf has a 190-foot curving facade made of Aberdeen granite with a frieze of cherubs depicting the arts and sciences. Edward Sanders and Wild hired the young architect Alexander Marshall Mackenzie to build the hotel. Marshall Mackenzie (brother-in-law of distinguished Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh) went to New York to capture the pioneering new style in luxury.\n\nThe Waldorf was built with a Gentlemen's Smoking room (now the Executive Boardroom), a billiard room (now the Executive Lounge), a ladies writing room (now the Aldwych meeting room), a 300 ft. dining space (now the Adelphi Suite), and the beautiful Palm Court.\n\nHomage pays tribute to the grand cafés of Europe and is open for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner.\n\nThe hotel bar is named after Howard Godfrey and His Waldorfians, the resident band signed under Piccadilly Records in the 1930s.\n\nThe Parrot London is a cocktail bar and music venue offering quality food, drinks and entertainment in a tropical-themed environment.\n\nThe bar was created in collaboration with actor, DJ and producer, Idris Elba and brothers Lee and Nicky Caulfield.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1933 by D.W. Brooks, a University of Georgia agronomy instructor as the Cotton Producers Association, a cooperative to help farmers in Carrollton, Georgia, market cotton. It soon grew and diversified into fields such as fertilizer and retailing farm supplies. It soon entered the poultry business. In 1998 it exited the agronomy business to focus on protein products, primarily chicken but also pork. In 2004, with the approval of its membership, it converted from being a cooperative to a for-profit stock-ownership company, listed on NASDAQ. In 2006, Gold Kist was acquired by Pilgrim's Pride.\n\nGold Kist operated nine fully integrated poultry divisions in Alabama, Georgia, Florida and North and South Carolina. Each division operated its own hatchery, feed mill, and processing plant.\n\nGold Kist contracted with approximately 2,300 family farmers to raise the chickens. The farmers provide the houses, equipment, utilities and labor to grow the birds. Gold Kist provides the chicks, feed and technical assistance. When the chickens reach market weight, Gold Kist processes and markets them. This contractual arrangement gives farmers access to global markets but reduces their exposure to market volatility.\n\nGold Kist operated three types of chicken farms; Pullet, Layer, and Broiler.\n\nThe company's pullet farms are where select breeds are raised to about 20\n\nOn a Gold Kist layer farm pullets were grown for a few weeks along with Roosters (about 1 rooster for every 8-10 hens) where they begin to mate and eventually lay eggs. The eggs that leave a Gold Kist layer farm (usually twice per week) were taken to the local division's hatchery. The birds were kept here for no more than 10 months.\n\nA Gold Kist layer house was usually 30-40 feet wide and 400-600 feet long. Each may house about 15,000 birds. A farm may contain a number of these but most contain only two side-by-side houses. Inside the house there are several automated systems including feed chains, water pipes, curtain drops, fans (two for every of length of the house), and a Cool Cell system acting like an air conditioning system during hot days.\n\nThe layer hens' hatched chicks were taken to a Gold Kist broiler farm where they were grown from the day they hatch (Usually just hours after hatching) for about 6 to 8 weeks.\n\nA Gold Kist broiler house was usually 30-40 feet wide and 400-600 feet long.

All members of this genus were considered part of a single species until 2002, the babirusa, \"B. babyrussa\", but following that, was split into several species. This scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named \"B. celebensis\". The remarkable \"prehistoric\" appearance of these mammals is largely due to the prominent upwards incurving canine tusks of the males, which actually pierce the flesh in the snout.\n\nAll species of babirusa are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), shown on their Red List since at least 2010 and current in 2017.\n\nThe genus is monotypic within the subfamily Babyrousinae, or alternatively considered to form a tribe, Babyrousini, of the subfamily Suinae. To date, only one fossil skull has been found to suggest a larger ancestor.\n\nAll members of the genus were considered part of a single species, the babirusa or pig-deer, \"B. babyrussa\". They were split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and the Sula Islands, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named \"B. celebensis\". The split, which uses the phylogenetic species concept, is based on differences in size, amount of hair on body and tail-tuft, and measurements of the skull and teeth.\n\n\n\"B. babyrussa beruensis\" was described as an extinct, Pleistocene subspecies from southwestern Sulawesi before babirusas were split into multiple species.\n\nBabirusa are notable for the long upper canines in the males. The upper canines of male babirusa emerge vertically from the alveolar process, penetrating through the skin and curving backward over the front of the face and towards the forehead. The lower canines also grow upwards. The canines of the female are either reduced or absent. The structure of the male's canines vary by species. In the golden babirusa, the upper canines are short and slender with the alveolar rotated forward to allow the lower canines to cross the lateral view. The Togian babirusa also has the same characteristics and the upper canines always converge. The North Sulawesi babirusa has long and thick upper canines with a vertically implanted alveolar. This caused the upper canines to emerge vertically and not cross with the lower canines. Babirusa also vary by species in other characteristics. The golden babirusa has a long, thick pelage that is white, creamy gold, black or gold overall and black at the rump. The pelage of the Togian babirusa is also long but not as that of the golden babirusa. The Togian babirusa has a tawny, brown or black pelage that is darker on the upper parts than in the lower parts. The North Sulawesi babirusa has very short hair and appears bald. The female babirusa has only one pair of teats.\n\nBabirusa are native to Sulawesi, some of the Togian Islands, the Sula Islands and Buru. In Sulawesi, they range from the northern peninsula to the south and south east provinces. Although babirusas are present on both Sulawesi and Sula, they are not found on the large islands between the two, the Banggai Archipelago. It has been hypothesized that the unusual distribution is due to their being transported by humans as gifts bestowed by native royalty. The preferred habitat of babirusa are tropical rainforests along river banks. It appears that they have been confined to the higher grounds in the interior despite occurring in lowland areas near coasts in the past. They are also active during the daytime. Like all pig species, babirusa have an omnivorous diet with an intestinal tract similar to that of the domestic pig. The stomach diverticulum of a babirusa is enlarged which may indicate that it is a ruminant but evidence shows otherwise. Because it does not have a rostral bone in the nose, a babirusa does not dig with its snout like other pigs do except in mud and swampy grounds. The diet of the babirusa includes leaves, roots, fruits and animal material. Apparently, the strong jaws of a babirusa are capable of easily cracking hard nuts.\n\nMale babirusa tend to live solitarily while adult females can be found in groups with young. Groups of female and young babirusa may number up to 84 individuals, most of which contain no adult males. Males rarely travel in pairs or trios. The tusks of the adult males are used in intraspecific fighting. The upper tusks are for defense while the lower tusks are offensive weapons. If a babirusa does not grind its tusks (achievable through regular activity), they can eventually keep growing so as to penetrate the animal's own skull .\n\nFemale babirusa cycle lengths are between 28 and 42 days and estrus last 2–3 days. The litter size for a babirusa is usually one or two piglets. \n\nIn Indonesia, the striking appearance of the babirusa has inspired demonic masks, and the animal itself is sometimes used as a gift to present to visitors.\n\nThe Balinese Hindu-era Court of Justice pavilion and the \"floating pavilion\" of Klungkung palace ruins are notable for painted babirusa \"raksasa\" (grotesques) on the ceilings.\n\nPrehistoric paintings of babirusa found in caves on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia have been dated back at least 35,400 years (to the ice age Pleistocene epoch). Adam Brumm, who co-authored the 2014 study dating the paintings, said “The paintings of the wild animals are most fascinating because it is clear they were of particular interest to the artists themselves.\"\n\nBabirusas are protected in Indonesia and killing them is illegal in most cases. However, poaching remains a significant threat to the babirusa. Additionally, commercial logging operations threaten the babirusa by habitat loss, and also reduce cover, making the babirusa more exposed to poachers. All extant species of babirusa are listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.\n\n"}

The album was a modest success and was followed by further minor hits, \"If You'll Be Mine\" and \"Back Together\".\n\nThe 2000 album \"Bugged\" was well-received critically. However, sales were poor and the two singles from it, \"The F-Word\" (later the theme tune to a UK TV cookery show of the same name) and \"Out of Sight\" barely dented the charts. Babybird were dropped by their record label soon after. A third single from the album \"Fireflies/Getaway\" was released on Animal Noise records, but sold few copies. The band subsequently split.\n\nIn the following years, Jones returned to where he had started – releasing albums of demos (under his own name) to a small but appreciative audience. This time round he produced two albums of instrumental music designed to help him develop a career in film music. \"Stephen Jones 1985–2001\" was released in 2001, and \"Plastic Tablets\" came out in 2003. Stephen created the soundtrack for the film \"Blessed\" in 2004.\n\nBetween the two instrumental albums, Stephen collaborated with the Manchester-based dance artist Aim on a single, \"Good Disease\", and worked on an album of demo songs. This became the hip-hop influenced \"Almost Cured of Sadness\", on Sanctuary Records. Again, Stephen was to score a critical success, but legal problems over samples delayed its release. It and the single \"Friend\" received little promotion and sold few copies.\n\nIn October 2005, a posting on the official Babybird website announced that the band had reformed. The subsequent album was called \"Between My Ears There Is Nothing But Music\". Again, Babybird failed to achieve commercial success, and were dropped by the Echo label.\n\nTwo more albums followed on Unison records: 2010's \"Ex-Maniac\", and 2011's \"The Pleasures of Self Destruction\". Sales were disappointing, and Unison declined to release further Babybird albums.\n\nIn 2008, Jones worked on a solo project entitled 'Death of the Neighbourhood' . The eponymous debut album, a 32 track 2-disc CD set was released on 10 November 2008 on ATIC Records. The album features \"Cokeholes\", which was released as a three track single on 27 October 2008.\n\nIn 2012, Stephen Jones announced the beginning of a new musical identity, Black Reindeer. The first Black Reindeer album, \"Music for the Film That Never Got Made\", was released on Bandcamp. Seven more albums of instrumental music followed through 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Jones released a new song with vocals entitled \"The Great Sadness\".\n\nStephen Jones has produced two works of fiction, \"The Bad Book\" in 2000 and \"Harry and Ida Swop Teeth\" (also the title of a Babybird b-side) in 2003. He also collaborated with DED Associates, who have designed many of his CD covers, on a 2000 art book \"Travel Sickness\".\n\n\n\n\n\"I'll just say that \"I Was Born A Man\" is the only record I've heard this year with lyrics worth remembering and music that's impossible to forget, because I'd rather you listen to it than me talking about it.\" – \"Melody Maker\"\n\n\"...whatever ultra-naff low-fidelity keyboard tinklings he undertakes; he carries with him incredibly touching pieces like Dead Bird Sings that create, in the middle of this tank top of a record, an altogether different kind of sadness.\" – \"NME\"\n\n\n\"...unique, customised but never self-indulgent or irritatingly inaccessible.

Nonetheless, '1985–2001' is another interesting dispatch from the no-frills renaissance man.\" – \"NME \"\n\n\"He was always an affecting songwriter as well as an extremely able band frontman, but it is these solo lo-fi tinkerings that really provide the keys to his soul.

Vasai Creek forms the northern boundary of Salsette Island and empties west into the Arabian Sea. Thane creek empties southwards into Bombay Harbour.\n\nTo the south of the creek lies the Bhayandar shore, which is developed on both sides of the railway track. Two railway bridges connect Naigaon and other stations to the Western suburbs. Old bridge is believed to have been built during the British Raj and has been closed since it was declared too dangerous to cross. The new bridge is functional and has 4 tracks. The Bhayandar seashore has been developed with protective measures for enthusiasts. It houses a children's park, playground, puja area and visarjan area for idol immersion on the east side. On the west there are small garden benches. There are also small paths heading down into the sea where the waves can be watched hitting the shoreline.\n\nThe areas around the Vasai creek have been developing at high pace. To accommodate the growing demand of transport, the creek is being looked forward to be used as a waterway to boost inland water and cargo transport.

Premiering at the Opening Ceremony on February 8, 2002, it began with the call by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of \"Citius! Altius! Fortius!\" (Faster, Higher, Stronger), which is the Olympic Motto chosen by the founder of the modern Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin. \n\nThe recording of this theme heard during the 2002 Winter Games was made November 27, 2001 in Maurice Abravanel Hall in Salt Lake City, with the composer conducting the Utah Symphony Orchestra and the 360-voice Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\nBecause of differing opinions on the pronunciation of the Latin text, the Choir actually recorded several versions, leaving the final decision to be made by the producers. The issue was whether to use a Classical pronunciation of the Olympic Motto (kitty-us, alty-us, forty-us), a liturgical one (cheetsy-oos, ahltsy-oos, fortsy-oos), or a hybrid of the two (chitty-us, etc.).\n\nIn addition to the text variations, the Choir and Orchestra also recorded two versions of the theme for timing purposes. The full-length, five-minute version appears on the John Williams CD \"American Journey\" and in the Tabernacle Choir's own recording on \"Spirit of America\" (with the Orchestra at Temple Square) and is the one performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Orchestra at Temple Square in their concerts. A shorter version, about half the length of the original, was recorded for the Opening Ceremony of the Games. In addition, the theme was repeated throughout the games. A common occurrence was during medal ceremonies where the theme played during the presentation portion of the ceremony.\n\nThe work is Williams' fourth composition for the Olympics, after 1984's \"Olympic Fanfare and Theme,\" 1988's \"The Olympic Spirit,\" and 1996's \"Summon the Heroes.\"\n\n"}

Harrison (born June 12, 1958) is an American actress possibly best known for her role as the replacement for blonde roommate Cindy Snow on the hit sitcom \"Three's Company\", between 1980 and 1982. She went on to play Jamie Ewing Barnes in \"Dallas\" from 1984 to 1986.\n\nBefore breaking into show business, Harrison was a cheerleader from 1978–1980 for the Los Angeles Rams.\nIn 1980, Harrison graduated with an education degree from USC. In the same year, she won the title Sweetheart of Sigma Chi. It was while studying at USC that Jenilee first met acting coach Joyce Selznick. Selznick gave her a lot of handy tips on how to polish her acting skills. \n\nHarrison joined the cast of ABC's \"Three's Company\" in 1980. She entered the show as a replacement for Suzanne Somers who played the sitcom's \"ditzy blonde\" Chrissy Snow. Somers left the show just after the show's fifth season had begun. Harrison was cast as Somers' replacement. Harrison's character, Cindy Snow, was created to be Chrissy Snow's cousin. Unlike Chrissy, Cindy was not a \"dumb blonde\"; instead, she was an extremely clumsy farm girl. The character of Cindy was similar enough to Chrissy, however, that producers could use scripts already written with the Chrissy character in mind. Harrison debuted on \"Three's Company\" in the episode entitled \"Chrissy's Cousin\" (season five, episode seven). She enters as Jack and Janet's new roommate after Chrissy's departure. Cindy proves she is a klutz right away by knocking Jack down. Her constant \"accidents\" (mainly with Jack) added to the show's gags of characters being clumsy. Though she had replaced Somers, Harrison was not given opening-credits billing, and instead Somers still obtained opening billing (as a part of finishing off her contract). Harrison was end-credits billed, as a guest star.\n\nFor the sixth season of \"Three's Company\", a new blonde roommate named Terri Alden (Priscilla Barnes), a smart nurse, took Cindy's place in the apartment. Harrison was retained on the show and this time was given opening-cast billing. She now had a lesser role, however, appearing less frequently in the series, with the character living near the apartment at UCLA. By the end of the season Cindy Snow disappeared from the series, her last appearance being in \"Janet Wigs Out\" (season six, episode 24).\n\nBeginning in 1984, Harrison portrayed the recurring character Jamie Ewing Barnes in the drama \"Dallas\". She played the role until 1986. Her character was actually killed off twice, first when she starts the car belonging to her brother, Jack Ewing, in the episode \"Blast from the Past\" and it explodes, killing her. After the entire ninth season was explained away as a dream, Harrison returned for her character to die again. Early in 1987, Jamie was killed in a mountain-climbing accident.\n\nIn 1984, Harrison played a reluctant prostitute in the movie \"Tank\" alongside James Garner and C. Thomas Howell.\n\nIn 1985, she appeared on \"Super Password\" with Dick Gautier, appearing again in 1986, this time with Marty Cohen, Michael Young, and Bruce Baum, and \"Dallas\" star Ken Kercheval in 1987 with Bert Convy. Also, in 1985, she made a brief appearance as a waitress in Loverboy's music video \"Lovin' Every Minute Of It\".\n\nHarrison also guest-starred on \"That '70s Show\" in 1999. In 1991, she starred in the movie \"Panga\" opposite Christopher Lee.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2005 Harrison began appearing in a couple of \"As Seen on TV\" infomercials like the AB Flex, the Sobakawa Pillow and the Ultimate Chopper with Chef Tony.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Harrison dated L.A. Rams guard Dennis Harrah and Major League Baseball player Reggie Jackson.\n\nIn 1993, Harrison married Dr. Bruce Oppenheim, a prominent Los Angeles-area chiropractor, who is the ex-husband of actress Cybill Shepherd. She has two stepchildren from her husband's previous marriage to Shepherd: Molly Ariel Shepherd-Oppenheim and Cyrus Zachariah Shepherd-Oppenheim.\n\n"}

He earned his nickname of \"The Bodysnatcher\" due to his ability to land vicious body punches in fights. McCallum was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2011, \"The Ring\" magazine ranked him as eighth on their list of the \"10 best middleweight title holders of the last 50 years.\"\n\nClaimed an amateur record of 240–10\n\nMike McCallum turned professional in 1981. As a professional, he fought almost exclusively in the USA. He first became a world champion in 1984 by defeating Sean Mannion to win the vacant WBA super welterweight title. McCallum would defend that title six times, winning all six fights by knock out.\n\nHis first prominent opponent was future two-weight world champion and future fellow International Boxing Hall of Fame member Julian Jackson, whom McCallum fought in his third title defense. McCallum survived some punishment in the first round and came back to stop the undefeated Jackson in the second round.\n\nMcCallum really came to prominence when he knocked out former WBC welterweight title-holder Milton McCrory and former undisputed world welterweight champion, another future International Boxing Hall of Fame member, Donald Curry in 1987. Curry was ahead on all three scorecards going into the fifth round when McCallum knocked him out with what some have called a \"perfect\" left hook.\n\nIn 1988, he moved up to middleweight, suffering his first defeat, a clear unanimous decision, in an attempt to win the WBA middleweight championship from Sumbu Kalambay. In 1989, McCallum defeated Herol Graham by a split decision to win the then-vacant WBA middleweight title (which had been stripped from Kalambay for signing to face IBF champion Michael Nunn). He defended the title three times, defeating Steve Collins, Michael Watson, and Kalambay in a rematch.\n\nMcCallum fought IBF middleweight champion James Toney in 1991. McCallum was stripped of the WBA title before the bout. The fight ended in a draw, and McCallum lost the second fight by a controversial majority decision the following year. Some felt that McCallum won both fights.\n\nMcCallum then moved up two weight divisions and won the WBC interim light heavyweight title against Randall Yonker, then won the full WBC title by outpointing Jeff Harding in 1994. Being in his late thirties, he did not hold the crown long, losing the title to Fabrice Tiozzo. At 40 years of age, he attempted to regain the vacant Interim WBC title against Roy Jones Jr in December 1996, but lost by a wide decision.\n\nIn his last fight, McCallum lost a rubber match to James Toney via a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout.\n\nMcCallum had a professional record of 49-5-1 (36 knockouts). He was never knocked out as a professional. After McCallum retired, he moved to Las Vegas and became a trainer. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\n"}

The northern sanxian is generally larger, at about in length, while southern versions of the instrument are usually about in length.\n\nIt has been suggested that \"sanxian\", a form of spike lute, may have its origin in the Middle East, and older forms of spike lute were also found in ancient Egypt. Similar instruments may have been present in China as early as the Qin dynasty as \"qin pipa\" (\"pipa\" was used as a generic term in ancient China for many other forms of plucked chordophones) or \"xiantao\" (弦鼗) , which the Qinqin and Ruan also come from. Some thought that the instrument may have been re-introduced into China together with other instruments such as \"huqin\" by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), however, an image of a sanxian-like instrument was found in a stone sculpture dating from the Southern Song period (1217–79). The first record of the name \"sanxian\" may be found in a Ming dynasty text.\n\nThe instrument was transmitted to other East Asian countries, for example to Japan as \"shamisen\".\n\nThe sanxian has a dry, somewhat percussive tone and loud volume similar to the banjo. The larger sizes have a range of three octaves. It is primarily used as an accompanying instrument, as well as in ensembles and orchestras of traditional Chinese instruments, though solo pieces and concertos also exist. The sanxian is used in \"nanguan\" and \"Jiangnan sizhu\" ensembles, as well as many other folk and classical ensembles.\nTraditionally the instrument is plucked with a thin, hard plectrum made from animal horn but today most players use a plastic plectrum (similar to a guitar pick) or, alternatively, their fingernails. This use of fingers to pluck the instrument often shares technique with that of the \"pipa\" and is most commonly used in performance of \"sanxian\" arrangements of works traditionally written for the \"pipa\". This allows for \"pipa\" techniques such as tremolo to be used. Other techniques for \"sanxian\" include the use of harmonics and hitting the skin of the instrument with the plectra or fingernail (comparable to the technique used to play the northern Japanese \"tsugaru-jamisen\").\n\nA closely related musical instrument is the Japanese \"shamisen\", which originated from the Chinese \"sanxian\". Even more closely related is the Okinawan \"sanshin\", which is also covered in snakeskin. Additionally, the \"sanshin\" and \"sanxian\" share a structurally similar body part consisting of a round-edged square of wood. In the Japanese \"shamisen\", the body (\"sao\") is made of four pieces of wood instead of one. The Mongolian \"shanz\" and the Vietnamese \"đàn tam\" are also very similar to the \"sanxian\". \n\nIn addition to its use in traditional and classical Chinese music, some popular and rock musicians have used the sanxian, most notably the singer He Yong (何勇) and his father He Yusheng (何玉声). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a quick, planing dinghy that differs from the Laser in that it has a jib, symmetric spinnaker and a trapeze for the crew. It was designed by New Zealander Frank Bethwaite and was first launched as a product in Australia then North America in 1979 and in Europe in 1980. The hull is made of GRP (glass reinforced plastic). The rig is a Bermudian rig sloop with spinnaker. It is designed to be a mid to high performance racer. In Britain, its most common current use is at university class in British University Sailing Association (BUSA) events. A version known as the Laser Fun was available, the same hull but featuring a reefable mainsail and a roller furling jib, and with the option of an asymmetric spinnaker (Laser Fun New Wave). As a strict one-design boat the Laser 2 was not available for amateur construction. \n\nFrank Bethwaite's hull design for the Laser 2 was married to a new deck and rig to produce the Laser 3000 in 1996, which has since gone on to form the basis of the 3000 Class.

While he is regarded by some as a namesake of the town of McCloud, California, and the nearby McCloud River, please see historical note below.\n\nBorn and raised in Ohio, McCloud moved to Iowa when he was a young man, where at the young age of 20, he was elected to the position of County Surveyor of newly organized Linn County, Iowa. He married Mary Campbell in Iowa in 1848, came to California during the California Gold Rush as a Forty-Niner in the early 1850s, but had limited success in the gold fields. His wife took the Oregon Trail and joined him in Northern California in 1853. Together they operated an early inn in the (now-disappeared) mining settlement of Portuguese Flat, California on the upper Sacramento River. The McClouds purchased the rights of the Lockhart brothers to property at the site now known as Upper Soda Springs in present-day Dunsmuir, California, where they expanded an early wayside hostel into a more substantial inn.\n\nMcCloud was instrumental in improving the roads and trails in Siskiyou County, California, and was twice elected County Surveyor. In 1856, the Shasta Courier published a statement by Ross McCloud in which he advertised completion of his new project: \"The new trail by way of the Sacramento river to Yreka is now completed and (mule) trains can now pass without crossing any mountains or having any deep snows to contend with. No molestation from Indians. The undersigned claims this trail to be the best mountain trail in Calif, and asks the public to test its merits and decide for themselves. There is no want of feed for animals on this route. Ross McCloud, Shasta, Cal. Feb, 2, 1856.\" McCloud's improvements were an upgrade to an earlier and rougher version of what became known as the Siskiyou Trail.\nBy 1860, mule train and later stagecoach traffic between California's Central Valley, Yreka, California and Oregon had increased, and the McClouds (and their business partner Isaac Fry) built and operated a toll bridge over the Sacramento River at Upper Soda Springs, as well as increasing the size of the inn. In particular, travelers came to enjoy the \"soda water\" at the Upper Soda Springs site. Ross also built and operated a sawmill near present-day Mount Shasta, California.\n\nThe McClouds eventually sold their interest in the Upper Soda Springs inn, and moved to a ranch near present-day Gazelle, California, where Ross died in 1868. The Upper Soda Springs inn was later acquired and operated by the daughter of Ross and Mary, Elda McCloud Masson, under the name \"Upper Soda Springs Resort\" until 1920 (see image at right of Upper Soda Springs Resort about 1885).\n\nThe McCloud River was likely originally known as the \"McLeod River,\" after Alexander Roderick McLeod, the leader of a number of hunting and trapping expeditions for the Hudson's Bay Company in Northern and Central California. A.R. McLeod's expedition of 1829-1830 spent several weeks during that winter trapped by heavy snow near the headwaters of the McCloud River. By the early 1860s, however, the spelling \"McCloud River\" was widely used in the region; while some regard this spelling as being adopted partly to respect the pioneer Ross McCloud and his family, it appears that the use of the \"McCloud\" spelling developed primarily as it was the conventional American spelling of the name. When the town of McCloud, California was later organized, the town similarly took the spelling \"McCloud.\"\n\n"}

It is the largest US national marine sanctuary and has a shoreline length of stretching from just north of the Golden Gate Bridge at San Francisco to Cambria in San Luis Obispo County. Supporting one of the world’s most diverse marine ecosystems, it is home to numerous mammals, seabirds, fishes, invertebrates and plants in a remarkably productive coastal environment. The MBNMS was established in 1992 for the purpose of resource protection, research, education, and public use.\n\nThe Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) is one of the largest of a system of 13 National Marine Sanctuaries administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nIt stretches from Rocky Point in Marin County, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, to the town of Cambria in San Luis Obispo County, and encompasses a shoreline length of and of ocean surrounding Monterey Bay.\nIts seaward Boundary is an average of offshore, and shoreward boundary the mean high tide.\nIts area is 6,094 square statute miles or 4,024 square nautical miles.\nThe deepest point is 10,663 feet (3,250 meters) in the Monterey Submarine Canyon, which is deeper than the Grand Canyon.\nThe average ocean surface temperature is 55 °F (13 °C).\n\nThe sanctuary provides habitat for 34 species of marine mammals, 94 species of seabirds, 345 species of fish, 4 of turtles,\n31 phyla of invertebrates, and more than 450 species of marine algae.\nHistorical sites include 1,276 reported shipwrecks and 718 prehistoric sites.\nThe MBNMS has major programs for research and monitoring, and another for education and outreach\n\nA Coastal Discovery Center is located across the Pacific Coast Highway from the Hearst Castle visitor’s center in San Simeon, California near the William Randolph Hearst Memorial State Beach.\n\nThe Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary Exploration Center opened on July 23, 2012 at 35 Pacific Ave. in Santa Cruz, CA.\n\nMBNMS collaborations include:\n\n\nAreas with overlapping jurisdiction include (roughly from north to south): \n\n\nSee the MBNMS event calendar for a list of meetings, as well as volunteer events such as Snapshot Day, Urban Watch, First Flush (water quality monitoring programs), and TeamOCEAN (kayaker naturalist program).\n\nThe Sanctuary Integrated Monitoring Network (SIMoN) website was launched in 2003 to collect metadata for their various monitoring projects. In 2012, this information was released as an iOS application to allow visitors better access to the over 4,200 photos that have been collected.\n\nA Marine Sanctuaries Study Bill was first proposed in 1967, with lobbying efforts by the Sierra Club. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 authorized the United States Environmental Protection Agency to monitor off-shore dumping. In 1975, the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission recommended a marine sanctuary, and in 1976 Santa Cruz County and Monterey County joined the lobbying effort. In 1983 the Ronald Reagan administration dropped the area for consideration as a sanctuary.\n\nIn 1988 congress re-authorized the Sanctuaries Act and proposed a sanctuary in Monterey Bay. However, public hearings, with the memory of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, brought protests demanding a larger size. The first Draft Environmental Impact Statement was released in 1990, and a final management plan in June 1992 proposing the extended area. On September 20, 1992 the MBNMS was authorized by legislation proposed by congressman Leon Panetta. It was the largest federal marine sanctuary.\n\nThere have been five Superintendents of the MBNMS since its inception:\n\n\nSince the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) had been established earlier and had a staff already, the section north of Año Nuevo point near the San Mateo County line was managed by GFNMS from its office in San Francisco. By 1996, Terry Jackson of MBNMS requested to have the management boundaries match the preserve. Ed Ueber of GFNMS saw no reason to change.\n\nThere are oil and gas reserves off the coast, but exploration has not been permitted. In 1982, Interior Secretary James G. Watt proposed opening the Central California coast outer continental shelf to oil and gas exploration. California residents and politicians strongly opposed the proposal and it was defeated. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush used an obscure 1953 law to permanently ban oil and gas development in California's Monterey Bay. In November, 2017, President Obama used the same law to ban oil exploration from Hearst Castle to Point Arena in Mendocino County, California.\n\nIn July 2017, under the direction of Executive Order 13795 from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Commerce began re-evaluating the protected status of the sanctuary, which includes the Davidson Seamount off the coast of Big Sur. The seamount, at long, wide, and high, is one of the largest in the world. Opening the area to oil and gas exploration was opposed by many environmentalists and residents.\n\n\n"}

It is native to northern Iran (where it is called ) and southern Azerbaijan (where it is called \"\") and it is endemic in the Alborz mountains.\n\nThe species was named by Carl Anton von Meyer to honor his predecessor at the University of Dorpat, German naturalist Georg Friedrich Parrot., who botanized in the Alborz on a mountaineering expedition in the 1830s. \n\nAnother species Parrotia subaequalis (commonly called Chinese ironwood) originates from eastern China. There are five disjunct\npopulations of \"P. subaequalis\" in eastern China: two each in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces (Huang et al. 2005) and one in Anhui\n(Shao and Fang 2004). A full account of this sibling species can be found in an article: 'The Chinese Parrotia: A Sibling Species of the\nPersian Parrotia' by Jianhua Li and Peter Del Tredici.\n\nThis species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN (under its former name of \"Shaniodendron subaequale\", which is no longer an accepted name for the species). \"P. subaequalis\" is also considered critically endangered (Grade I Key protected Wild Plant) in the China Red Data Book, with a very narrow distribution range. The five known relict populations of P. subaequalis comprise no more than 100 reproductive individuals. Therefore, this species has high conservation priority.\n\n\"Parrotia persica\" grows to tall and broad, with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is smooth, pinkish-brown flaking/peeling to leave cinnamon, pink, green, and pale yellow patches in a similar manner to plane trees. The leaves are alternate, ovoid, often slightly lop-sided, long and across, with wavy margins; they are glossy green, turning a rich purple to brilliant red in autumn.\n\nThe flowers are somewhat similar to witch-hazel flowers but dark red; they are likewise produced in late winter on bare stems, but differ in having only four rounded sepals with no petals; the stamens are however fairly conspicuous, forming a dense red cluster across. The fruit is a two-parted capsule containing two seeds, one in each half.\n\nThe richness of Iran's flora and the variety of its vegetation results from the variety and richness of its physical-geographic and natural-historic conditions and from its compound history influenced by the remote florist regions.\n\nRelict genera of the tertiary period can be frequently found in all the zones of North of Iran especially in Talysh. They are the Persian iron tree (\"Parrotia persica\"), the Lenkoran acacia (\"Albizia julibrissin\"), the basket oak (\"Quercus castaneifolia\"), the Caucasian persimmon (\"Diospyros lotus\"), the evergreen shrub \"Ruscus hyrcana\", the box tree (\"Buxus hyrcana\"), etc. There are 240 endemic species of plants in North and North West Iran and also south-east Azerbaijan.\nAmong the middle Miocene Sarmatian palynoflora from the Lavanttal Basin, Austria, researchers have recognized \"Parrotia\" fossil pollen. The sediment containing it had accumulated in a lowland wetland environment with various vegetation units of mixed evergreen/deciduous broadleaved/conifer forests surrounding the wetland basin. Key relatives of the fossil taxa found with \"Parrotia\" are presently confined to humid warm temperate environments, suggesting a subtropical climate during the middle Miocene in Austria.\n\n\"P. persica\" is cultivated as an ornamental tree for its brilliant autumn colour and the smooth, patterned bark. As an uncommon, drought-tolerant garden tree of moderate size, it is prized for its striking autumn colour and the exfoliating bark that develops on mature specimens.\n\nSeveral cultivars have been selected for garden planting:\n\n‘Vanessa’ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.\n"}

In June 1796, Hutchinson was convicted at the Old Bailey of stealing £ 40 worth of goods, and was sentenced to death, though this was later commuted to transportation for seven years. After spending three years in London on board the prison hulk \"Newgate\", Hutchinson was transported to Australia on the \"Hillsborough\", sometimes referred to as the \"Fever Ship\" since some ninety-five of the three hundred convicts aboard died from typhoid fever brought aboard from the prison hulks. Reaching Sydney in 1799, Hutchinson was again convicted of theft after stealing from the government stores in Sydney, and was transported to the penal settlement on Norfolk Island.\n\nHutchinson soon gained employ in the administration of the settlement, becoming an overseer of government livestock. In June 1801, he married his first wife Mary Cooper (also known as Mary Chapman), a convict who had been transported from Surrey, arriving on Norfolk Island in 1798; together they would have eight children, six of them born on Norfolk Island. In June 1803 he was appointed an acting superintendent of convicts on the island, and in 1805 he officially became an emancipist. By 1809 he was made a superintendent proper. Hutchinson acquired significant land holdings on the island, and did a handsome trade selling pork to the government.\n\nAfter 1803, there was a push for the settlement on Norfolk Island to be disbanded, mainly on the part of the then Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Lord Hobart; the military presence there was ultimately withdrawn in 1813, and Hutchinson, along with the boat-builder Thomas Ransom, was among the last of the settlers to leave the island in February 1814.\n\nMost of the Norfolk settlers were relocated to the recently founded Hobart Town, in the colony of Tasmania. However, Hutchinson had been recommended to the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, by the former Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island, Joseph Foveaux, and so Hutchinson instead returned to Sydney, where Macquarie appointed him the superintendent of convicts and public works, to succeed Isaac Nichols from April 1814. Hutchinson gained much influence in this position, however after John Bigge's reports into the transportation system in the Australian colonies, Hutchinson was replaced as superintendent by Frederick Hely in 1823. Hutchinson was to have been appointed chief wharfinger in Sydney in 1817, though this appointment was never formally recognised by the British authorities.\n\nHutchinson's eighth child with his first wife Mary was born in 1817; Mary is thought to have returned to England in March 1819, and there was no record of her after that. On 21 June 1825 Hutchinson married his second wife, Jane Roberts, who was also a former convict (having been transported for seven years, arriving in 1803) and who was the widow of another former convict turned businessman. Though the marriage only lasted a short time, two of Jane's sons from her first marriage married two of Hutchinson's daughters from his first marriage.\n\nHutchinson became a significant businessman in Sydney, forming business partnerships with Edward Eagar, William Redfern and Samuel Terry, among others; he also had extensive land holdings in Sydney, its suburbs and the surrounding towns, and also in Melbourne. His more rural holdings made him a successful pastoralist. He had participated in the 1816 founding of the Bank of New South Wales, and was a director of the bank from January 1929 onwards. In 1835, he was elected to the board of directors of both the Marine Insurance Co and the Australian Wheat and Flour Co, and participated in the formation of the Australian Patriotic Association, and in 1840 he was one of the original directors of the Mutual Fire Insurance Association.\n\nAt his death, Hutchinson left goods worth £20,000; together with his land holdings, his estate was worth £220,000, or about A$1.77 billion in 2004 value. On this valuation, in 2004 William Rubinstein placed Hutchinson at 147th on his list of the two hundred richest Australians of all time.\n"}

He began his music career at the age of nine as a vocalist and comedian with Leavitt's Bellringers, a company of entertainers that toured many of the larger cities of the United States. He began playing the cornet, traveling for six years with the Swiss Bellringers. After his touring days, he joined Blaisdell's Orchestra of Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nIn 1880, he came to Boston as a solo cornet player at The Park Theater. For nine years, he traveled with the Bostonians, an opera company. While with this company, he changed from cornet to trombone. He also performed with the Germania Band of Boston and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In the early 1900s he played with Wheeler's Band \nin Bellows Falls, Vermont. Wheeler's Band was the first band to publicly perform Bagley's \"National Emblem March\" in 1906.\n\nEdwin Eugene Bagley is best known for composing marches and in particular for the famous march \"National Emblem\". This piece is played as a patriotic tune on Independence Day celebrations in the United States and features an excerpt of The Star-Spangled Banner. It is also used by the U.S. military when presenting and retiring the colors. A theme from this march is popularly sung with the words \"and the monkey wrapped his tail around the flagpole\".\n\nBagley died in Keene, New Hampshire on January 29, 1922.\n\n\nEdwin was married to Jannette S. Hoyt (1855–1927). His brother Ezra M. Bagley (January 3, 1853 – July 8, 1886) was first trumpet in the Boston Symphony Orchestra 1880-1884 and also composed marches for bands.\nEdwin died at the Elliot Community Hospital in Keene, New Hampshire and is buried at the Greenlawn Cemetery in Keene. The Victorian Bandstand in Keene is named in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}

(or HES) is an Australian company that distributes computer games and gaming equipment. HES' offices are based in Riverwood, Sydney. HES's founder and managing director is MR Sebastian Giompaolo.\n\nThey began distributing Commodore 64 titles such as \"Pitfall!\" in 1982 and \"Kung-Fu Master\" in 1985 and Atari 2600 titles nearing the end of the 1980s under the name Activision.\n\nHES still remains a dominant distributor within Australia, despite not being well known. HES currently is the distributor for Mad Catz, Saitek, and Gamester joysticks, cables, memory cards, and other peripherals. HES also remains the official Australian distributor for Action Replay.\n\nQuite a large number of software titles are currently also being distributed by HES for Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance by publishers ZOO Digital Publishing, Tru Blu Entertainment and Phantagram.\n\nIn the past, HES had gained a reputation for developing and distributing some interesting peripherals such as their auto fire controllers, Game Boy power adaptors, Master System converters for the Mega Drive and adapters for NES games such as the HES Unidaptor and HES Unidaptor MKII.\n\nIn 1999, the company created the publishing arm Tru Blu Entertainment for software titles created by the company, including the hit NRL Rugby League and AFL Live titles.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s HES ported games from American Game Cartridges, American Video Entertainment (AVE), Bit Corp, Color Dreams, Epyx, Thin Chen Enterprise (Sachen, Joy Van, etc.) and Tengen onto the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) as unlicensed titles, although they did not release games by Camerica or Active Enterprises. Most games were released in plastic cases like a video box with printed instructions on the inside, however sometimes the AVE titles were released in their original AVE boxes with a HES sticker simply stuck over AVE's original one.\nHES at the time became widely known for their unlicensed distribution of NES games at budget prices. Nintendo tried to fight against all unlicensed companies by introducing a Nintendo Seal of Quality on all their products which signified that titles adorning the symbol are guaranteed to operate on their NES hardware. To combat this, HES introduced their own seal that mimicked Nintendo’s seal, possibly in the hope of confusing buyers.\n\nIn order to circumvent other methods that Nintendo created to stop unlicensed developers (10NES), HES developed the 'Piggy Back' or 'Dongle' games, where one could insert an official NES cart into the HES game and it operated the country code of the official title instead of HES'. This was so successful that HES also used the same technology to build a device to entirely bypass the 10NES security protocol which was released as the \"HES Unidaptor\". The adapter allowed 72-pin and 60-pin NTSC NES/Famicom games to be played on a PAL NES.\n\nHES introduced games to Australia that were not released elsewhere in the western world, and these have become very sought after classics. However, HES also chose to release their multigame cartridges and a few of their single game titles in very limited numbers. Such titles are extremely scarce and thus nearly impossible to find.\n\n\n\n\"4 Pak All Action\" was a 1995 unlicensed video game for the Sega Master System that was released exclusively in Australia. This game is only compatible with the Sega Master System 2 console. It includes four games: \"Power Block\", \"Adventure Kid\", \"Twin Mouse',' and \"Cave Dude\".\n\nHES released quite a few titles and multi game packs for the Atari 2600 Video Computer System. The cartridges are virtually identical to the Activision cartridges, but the Activision logo on the underside is blacked out.\n\n"}
