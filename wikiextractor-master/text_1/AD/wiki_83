It spans False Creek and is 27.4 metres above Granville Island. It is part of Highway 99.\n\nThe original bridge was completed in 1889. It was a 732-metre long low timber trestle. The navigation span, near the north end, was a trussed timber swing span, tied with wire ropes to a central wooden tower. It was largely designed by the CPR, and cost $16,000. In 1891 the bridge was widened on both sides for streetcar tracks, except where the tracks converged for the swing span.\n\nThe second bridge was completed in 1909. It was a longer, medium-level steel bridge with a through truss swing span.\n\nOn February 4, 1954, the current Granville Street Bridge, costing $16.5 million, opened. A million cars would cross over the bridge in its first month. The city of Vancouver funded the bridge itself as Mayor Frederick Hume said \"no formal assistance given by any other government body.\"\n\nThe eight-lane structure was constructed on the same alignment as the first bridge while steel plate girders salvaged from the second bridge made barges for constructing the foundations of the Oak Street Bridge.\n\nThe first \"civilian\" to drive over the 1954 bridge was the same woman who was first to drive over the second bridge in 1909. She had been widowed between the two openings, and so had a different name. Both times she was at the wheel of a brand-new Cadillac.\n\nRecent improvements to the bridge include increasing its earthquake resistance, and installing higher curbs and median barriers.\n\nIn December 2017, Vancouver City Council approved a plan to remove the \"Granville Loops\" - a pair of cloverleaf off-ramps connecting the bridge with Pacific Street - and open up the land to redevelopment.\n\nSince late 2018, the Granville Street bridge has being undergoing seismic retrofitting that will be completed in early 2021.\n\nIn January 2019, Vancouver City Council announced a plan to improve pedestrian and cyclist access to the bridge from the surrounding neighbourhoods by creating a new separated bike and walking path located in the centre of the bridge roadway. The plan was opened up for public comment in April 2019.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2296170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296170", "title": "Izzy Jannazzo", "text": "Izzy Jannazzo\n\nIsadoro Anthony \"Izzy\" Jannazzo (January 31, 1915 Ensley, Alabama – June 18, 1995 Columbus, Ohio) was an American professional boxer who contended for the NYSE World Welterweight Championship against Barney Ross in November 1936, and took the Maryland version of the World Welterweight Championship in October 1940. In 1937, he fought national welterweight champions before large crowds in Australia and Germany. In 1940, he was listed as the world's top welterweight contender by some sources. His managers were Guy Anselmi and Chris Dundee.\n\nIsadoro Jannazzo was born on January 31, 1915 in Ensley, Alabama to poor Sicilian Italian parents Francesca and Anthony Jannazzo. He would become part of a family of six, which included a sister Bernice and brothers Vincent and Sam and would live in his hometown until roughly the age of seventeen. He may have boxed in as many as one hundred amateur bouts, and once contended for a state bantamweight championship around the age of fourteen. After his family's move to New York around 1932, his mother died, causing him to shoulder additional financial responsibility for the support of his family. In 1941, Izzy married Francesca \"Frances\" Tombrello, who was five years his junior. Francesca's family, who had also lived in Ensley, Alabama, where she was born, had been friends of his family for many years. Francesca and her family moved to New York shortly after his. Izzy and his wife would settle on Troutman Street in Brooklyn, New York, in attached buildings near other family members.\n\nFighting in the New York City area, primarily Brooklyn or the Bronx between December 6, 1932, and January 13, 1934, he won nine of nineteen fights, losing six and drawing three times. He was not considered a power hitter yet won 65 of 126 bouts, though scoring only 8 knockouts.\n\nOn April 21, 1934, he defeated Murray Brandt in a six-round points decision at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn. He had formerly lost to Brandt in a six-round decision.\n\nOn May 31, 1934, he defeated Stanislaus Loayza in a six-round points decision at Fort Hamilton Arena in Brooklyn, New York. Stanislaus would contend for the NYSE World Lightweight Title in July 1935 against Jimmy Goodrich and was well known in his native Chile.\n\nOn November 17, 1934, he defeated Joe Rossi at the Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn, New York in a six-round points decision. Rossi was another well rated New York welterweight who had previously beaten Jannazzo in six rounds on September 30, 1933 in Brooklyn. He would draw with Rossi in a six-round Brooklyn bout shortly after.\n\nOn January 7, 1935, he defeated Tony Falco at the St. Nicholas Arena in New York in a ten-round points decision. Jannazzo, with a reach advantage landed effective rights in the first, had an even second, and fought fiercely and evenly in the third and fourth. Jannazzo took the fifth with clean rights to the body and face while eluding Falco. Falco took the sixth using both hands, but Jannazzo may have taken the eighth with two stiff rights to the head of Falco near the end of the round. Jannazzo may have taken the ninth with lefts to the face of Falco, though the tenth was even with both boxers too exhausted to land stiff blows.\n\nAt 145 pounds, Jannazzo fought Jackie Davis twice on January 26, and February 16, in eight round points decisions at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn, losing the first, but winning the second. Jannazzo had roughly a four-pound weight advantage in each bout.\n\nOn March 2, 1935, he lost to Kid Azteca at the Arena Nacional in Mexico City in a ten-round points decision. In 1936, Azteca, Mexico City born, would take and hold the Mexican Welterweight title and fight in five separate decades in his native land.\n\nOn May 4, 1936, Jannazzo, at 145 1/2, scored a small upset defeating top NYSE welterweight contender Billy Celebron at the St. Nicholas Arena in New York in a ten-round points decision. According to the United Press, Celebron won only three rounds with the fourth and seventh even.\n\nOn July 6, 1936, fighting at 145 1/2, he knocked out Steve Halaiko in the fourth of six rounds at the Dexter Park arena in Queens.\n\nAt 145 1/4 pounds, on July 22, 1936, he defeated former champion Johnny Jadick, in a ten-round points decision at the Dykman Oval in Manhattan. In a decisive win, Jannazzo put Jadick on the canvas in the first, fourth and sixth rounds. The fight was a benefit for the United Palestine Appeal. Jadick had previously taken the World Light Welterweight Championship on March 18, 1932 against Tony Canzoneri.\n\nOn October 30, 1936, he fought an important fifteen-round draw with Ceferino Garcia before a crowd of 5640 at New York's Madison Square Garden. In a fairly close bout, the Associated Press gave eight rounds to Garcia, six to Jannazzo, and one even. Jannazzo, a powerful hitter who had once floored Barney Ross, was thrown off in his attack by the scientific defense of Jannazzo, who was able to throw Garcia off balance from his attacks with his jabbing. Garcia scored the fight's only knockdown in the eighth for a count of one with a strong right. In the seventh through the fifteenth, both boxers changed the pace from the more cautious early rounds, and unleashed continuous punches. Garcia lost two of the first three rounds from penalties for low punches, and narrowly lost the other, but won most all of the remaining rounds through the ninth with a more aggressive display. The tenth through the twelfth went to Jannazzo who effectively used jabs to Garcia's head, interfering with his punching. Garcia would take the World Middleweight Championship in 1939.\n\nOn November 27, 1936, he faced the incomparable triple division champion Barney Ross before 8,484 spectators in a NYSE recognized World Welterweight Championship at Madison Square Garden, losing in a fifteen-round unanimous decision. There were few serious knockdowns in the bout, a credit to Jannazzo, though Ross may have taken as many as nine rounds, clearly starting out with an edge in the first two. Jannazzo was knocked down only briefly in the second and the fifth, for counts of one, and two, both from rights from Ross, though he likely slipped backing away in the fifth. The Associated Press had Ross with ten of the fifteen rounds, with four to Janazzo and one even. Janazzo showed pluck lasting fifteen rounds with Ross, even scoring with hard right crosses in the seventh, eighth, and tenth, though the outcome of the bout was never strongly in doubt.\n\nOn June 18, 1937, he defeated Phoenix welterweight Freddie Dixon in a ten-round points decision at the Municipal Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nOn December 21, 1937, and January 25, 1938, he fought Jack Carroll and Dick Humphries in Sydney, Australia, losing both bouts in ten round points decisions. The bout with Carroll, Australian Welterweight Champion, brought an enthused capacity crowd of 30,000, likely the largest crowd of Jannazzo's career. Jannazzo was badly pummeled by Carroll's blows to both body and head, but never tired in the bout, and attempted to return counterpunches after each encounter. The bout was described as one of Carroll's best. \"Jack Carroll Wins from Izzy Jannazzo\", \"The Winnipeg Tribune\" gave Carroll nine of the ten rounds.\n\nOn October 15, 1938, he fought a fifteen-round draw with Gustav Eder, German Welterweight Champion, at Hanseaten Hall in Hamburg, Germany. The bout was close, with Jannazzo scoring with fast lefts through the first seven rounds, but Eder scoring with rights to the head and body in the subsequent rounds. The decision was unpopular with the enthusiastic home crowd of 10,000, among whom may felt Jannazzo had shown more science in the boxing and landed the more telling blows. In a previous match in New York in September 1936 with Eder, Jannazzo had won a fifteen-round points decision.\n\nOn February 7, 1940, he defeated Jackie Burke in a ten-round points decision at the Watres Armory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Jannazzo battered Burke with both hands throughout the bout.\n\nOn April 10, 1940, he defeated Steve Mamakos at Riverside Stadium in Washington, D. C., in a ten-round split decision.\n\nOn September 4, 1940, he defeated Holman Williams in a ten-round points decision at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. In that year, Holman was rated seventh in the world among welterweights. He would become a boxer of some renown, taking the World Colored Middleweight Championship on October 16, 1942 against Charley Burley in New Orleans, Louisiana. Holman would lose the title to the \"Cocoa Kid\". Williams had previously beaten Jannazzo on March 27, 1940 in Scranton, Pennsylvania in a ten-round points decision. Williams, fighting at 150 in their March meeting, won from clever infighting in the later rounds, when Jannazzo may have tired from his strong opening rounds.\n\nHe won the Welterweight Championship of the World (as recognized by Maryland state), fighting at 147 pounds against the Puerto Rican boxer \"Cocoa Kid\" on October 14, 1940 in a close fifteen round split decision before 3,000 fans at Carlin's Park in Baltimore, Maryland. Jannazzo took the bout using a strong left jab, and effective footwork that left him out of the range of his Puerto Rican challenger. The \"Kid\", who fought with a four-pound disadvantage, repeatedly tried to take the fight to Jannazzo but was stopped by Jannazzo's ever present left jab. Jack Dempsey refereed the bout.\n\nOn December 12, 1940, Jannazzo lost to Georgie Abrams in a ten-round split decision at Carlin's Park in Baltimore. Though leading in the first two rounds, Jannazzo lost the third, being called for a low blow. In the late rounds, a strong attack by Abrams gave him the decision. Abrams dominated the infighting, but Jannazzo put on a more scientific and cautious defense.\n\nFighting at 145 1/2, on April 14, 1941, he defended the Maryland version of the World Welterweight Championship against Jimmy Leto in a fifteen-round split decision at the Coliseum in Baltimore, Maryland. Leto was a rated welterweight, and the victory was a significant one. Jannazzo once again used his strong left to win the bout, though the decision was somewhat disputed as the referee voted against Jannazzo, while both judges voted in his favor.\n\nOn September 21, 1942, in a lead-up to his fight with Sugar Ray Robinon, Jannazzo defeated Portuguese born Freddie Cabral in a ten-round points decision at the Valley Arena, in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nOn October 19, 1942, he lost to the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the first time at the arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a ten-round unanimous decision. Immediately after on December 1, 1942, he fought a return bout with Robinson at the Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, losing in an eighth round Technical Knockout.\n\nHe defeated \"Wild\" Bill McDowell of Dallas on June 17, 1943 in a ten-round points decision at Moers Field in Richmond, Virginia. McDowell was unable to use his left hand for seven rounds, after injuring his right in the third. McDowell had a ten-pound advantage over Jannazzo who weighed in at 149 1/2 pounds. It was a noteworthy win considering the disadvantages with which Jannazzo fought.\n\nOn May 9, 1944, he defeated Johnny Green at Memorial Auditorium before 3,893 fans in Buffalo, New York in a ten-round unanimous decision. Jannazzo, fighting at 152, won the bout with a well placed left, which he was unable to use to equal advantage in previous bouts with Green. Green had defeated and drawn with Jannazzo the previous February at the same venue in Buffalo. Green was a black boxer from Buffalo who fought several of the same opponents as Jannazzo.\n\nHe defeated Charley Parham twice in July and September 1945 at the Auditorium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Jannazzo took the September bout by a unanimous decision with Parham winning only one round, but their July bout was somewhat closer. Jannuzzo had \"little trouble\", however, in scoring the decision in their second meeting.\n\nOn November 16, 1945, he defeated Frankie Abrams before 3000 fans in a ten-round unanimous decision at Olympia Stadium in Detroit. Jannazzo took every round but the last, when Abrams made a late rally. Abrams scored four knockdowns in the second round, showing his dominance.\n\nOn March 14, 1946, he fought champion Sugar Ray Robinson for the last time in Baltimore, Maryland, losing in a ten-round unanimous decision before a somewhat disappointing crowd of 4100. All three judges voted for Robinson. Jannazzo at 154, was outboxed by Robinson throughout the fight, and Robinson won every round. He had formerly fought Robinson on October 13, 1944 in Boston Garden before a crowd of 7,347, losing in a second-round technical knockout. Robinson had returned to the ring after fourteen months in the army, but had no trouble dropping Jannazzo twice in the second with well placed lefts and rights to the head, before asking the referee to end the fight.\n\nOn June 17, 1946, fighting at 151 3/4, he defeated Ralph Zannelli at the Rhode Island Auditorium in a ten-round points decision.\n\nFighting at 155 pounds on June 5, 1946, he defeated Joe Governale in a ten-round split decision at McArthur Stadium in Brooklyn, New York. He would lose to Governale at the same location in a ten-round decision one month later.\n\nOn January 28, 1947, he fought his last fight against Steve Belloise at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida. Belloise scored a technical knockout in 2:20 of the third round, and his manager, Chris Dundee, announced Jannazzo's retirement after seventeen years in the ring.\n\nDuring WWII, Jannazzo worked as an air raid warden. After retiring from boxing in 1947, Jannazzo eventually worked for the city managing an incinerator for the department of sanitation. He retired at sixty-five to spend time with his children and grandchildren.\n\nAround 1991, shortly after he moved to Columbus, Ohio, his family placed him in a nursing home, due primarily to the progressive boxing induced dementia from which he was suffering.\n\nOn June 18, 1995, Jannazzo died in Columbus, Ohio. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Columbus, where his wife had been buried three months earlier.\n"}

{"id": "2296175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296175", "title": "Reactive distillation", "text": "Reactive distillation\n\nReactive distillation is a process where the chemical reactor is also the still. Separation of the product from the reaction mixture does not need a separate distillation step which saves energy (for heating) and materials. This technique can be useful for equilibrium-limited reactions such as esterification and ester hydrolysis reactions. Conversion can be increased beyond what is expected by the equilibrium due to the continuous removal of reaction products from the reactive zone. This approach can also reduce capital and investment costs.\n\nThe conditions in the reactive column are suboptimal both as a chemical reactor and as a distillation column, since the reactive column combines these. The introduction of an in situ separation process in the reaction zone or vice versa leads to complex interactions between vapor–liquid equilibrium, mass transfer rates, diffusion and chemical kinetics, which poses a great challenge for design and synthesis of these systems. Side reactors, where a separate column feeds a reactor and vice versa, are better for some reactions, if the optimal conditions of distillation and reaction differ too much.\n\nReactive distillation can be used with a wide variety of chemistries, including the following:\n\n\nThe esterification of acetic acid with alcohols including methanol, n-butanol, ethanol, isobutanol, and amyl alcohol.\n\nAnother interesting feature of this system is that it is associated with the formation of a minimum boiling ternary azeotrope of ester, alcohol and water, which is heterogeneous in nature. Hence, in a typical reactive distillation column that consists of both reactive and non-reactive zones, the heterogeneous azeotrope or a composition close to the azeotrope can be obtained as the distillate product. Moreover, the aqueous phase that forms after the condensation of the vapor is almost pure water. Depending on the requirement either of the phases can be withdrawn as a product and the other phase can be recycled back as reflux. The pure ester i.e. butyl acetate, being the least volatile component in the system, is realized as a bottom product.\n\nRemoving organic acids in alcohol (ethanol, isopropanol) dewatering columns is a simple example. An aqueous base (NaOH, KOH) is added to the top of the column, the acid-base reaction occurs in the column, and the resulting organic salts and excess base exit the bottom of the column with the separated water.\n"}
{"id": "2296180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296180", "title": "Vladimir Chertkov", "text": "Vladimir Chertkov\n\nVladimir Grigoryevich Chertkov (; also transliterated as Chertkoff, Tchertkoff or Tschertkow ( – November 9, 1936) was the editor of the works of Leo Tolstoy, and one of the most prominent Tolstoyans. After the revolutions of 1917, Chertkov was instrumental in creating the United Council of Religious Communities and Groups, which eventually came to administer the Russian SFSR's conscientious objection program.\n\nChertkov was born in 1854 in St. Petersburg, Russia into a wealthy and aristocratic family. His mother (to whom he felt especially close), Elizaveta Ivanovna, born Countess Chernysheva-Kruglikova, was known among her circle in St. Petersburg society for her beauty, intellect, authoritativeness and tact. His father, Grigorii Ivanovich, was aide-de-camp under Nikolai I, Adjutant-General under Alexander II and Alexander III, known in military circles for his front-line service and military bearing. The couple enjoyed imperial favour so much that Alexander II and Alexander III visited their home.\n\nDescribing his parents in one of his diary entries, he wrote: “That's how I grew up, assured of my own innate advantage over other people, proud of the dignity of my parents, their relatives and friends, entourage of servants, rising from their seats in the ante-room when I passed from my rooms into my parents’ part of the house, swimming in all kinds of luxury and almost not knowing rejection in satisfaction of my desires.”\n\nThe young Chertkov was considered very handsome – slender, tall, with big gray eyes under beaked brows – and had a talent for witty paradox.\n\nNineteen-year-old Chertkov voluntarily joined the Life Guards of the Cavalry. Yet while yielding to all the enjoyment that was offered by life in the circle of golden youth, unaware of either external or internal obstacles for the realization of his desires, Chertkov from time to time felt that there was something wrong in his life and strove to find some moral law that would subordinate his behavior. In order to understand these doubts, to look closer at other ways of life and remain alone with himself, he decided for a time to abandon his accustomed life, take a vacation for several months and go to England.\n\nAt the end of December 1879, Chertkov wrote his mother a letter from England:\n\nAnd he wrote further that concentrating all his thought on Christian study could be useful to deal with the problems of his life.\n\nIn 1880, he resigned from military service, left Petersburg, and settled in his family’s estate in Lizinovka, where he planned to help the peasants at whose expense he lived, although he had an unclear understanding of their needs.\nScrutinizing the work of the zemstvo and finding weaknesses, he conceived the idea of implementing on his parent’s estate some measures disregarded by the zemstvo. He organized a trade school for peasant children.\n\nIn October 1883 his first meeting with Leo Tolstoy took place in Moscow, changing the entire course of his life. It would be said of him that he was more Tolstoy than Tolstoy himself.\n\nFulfilling the ideal of moral self-improvement, Chertkov gave all his heart and soul to educational activity. Following Tolstoy’s initiative, in 1885 Chertkov organized and financed a publishing house called Intermediary () which specialized in the release of art and moralizing literature for people. Intermediary succeeded in publishing works aimed at the education of the Russian people, despite the pressure of the Imperial censorship and the hostile attitude of the Orthodox Church. The new publishing house was supported by many of the most outstanding writers of the country: Tolstoy, Chekhov, Korolenko, Garshin, and Leskov all wrote for Intermediary.\n\nBooks were sold unusually cheaply. Reasonable prices and good publicity, in which Repin, Surikov, Kivshenko and other Russian artists were engaged, helped distribution.\n\nChertkov had a troubled relationship with most of the Tolstoy family, and tried actively to destroy the relationship between Tolstoy and his wife Sophia. Tolstoy's final flight, for example, is described as having been greatly influenced by Chertkov. Sophia was especially troubled by what she felt was his hypocritical philosophy: he decried wealth, but had his own fancy estate. His associates lay about her house and ate free and paid no rent and criticized her materialism, while she raised several children and ran the entire business side of Tolstoy's writing (at Tolstoy's wish), which provided a major source of income for Yasnaya Polyana and enabled their lifestyle.\n\nAdditionally, Chertkov convinced Tolstoy to sign a secret will and give control of his works to Chertkov instead of Sophia. He then used this control to publish versions of Tolstoy's collected works as he wanted. He also criticized Sophia, discredited her diaries and her own writing, and played up his own relationship with the Count. Chertkov also fostered a positive relationship with the newly formed Soviet state, which he used to suppress Sophia's version of Tolstoy's life story and his relationship with her.\n\nChertkov’s closest employees were often engaged in editing and drawing up his plans on his farmstead in Rossosh, located in the Ostrogozhsk District. Rossosh had a manor house on top of a hill, as well as an extensive courtyard and subsidiary buildings; at the base of this mountain were three ponds in succession, and behind them 20 desyatina of forest. Soon the small village of Rossosh turned into a large publishing center. From here Chertkov conducted extensive correspondence on the affairs of Intermediary with Russian writers and artists. Tolstoy came to visit his friend here in the spring of 1894.\n\nSince the autocracy considered Tolstoyism an enemy, Chertkov left for England in 1897. He was an avid Anglophile like his mother, admired the English tradition of free speech, and was already corresponding with a small collective based at Purleigh in Essex, who were looking to put Tolstoy's ideas into practice. It was to Purleigh, therefore, that Chertkov initially gravitated and it was here that he set up a publishing company, the Free Word Press (), producing Russian-language versions of Tolstoy's works and kindred literature, much of which was smuggled back into Russia. A separate branch of this business, the Free Age Press, producing English-language texts, was set up in 1900. Chertkov's wife, Anna Konstantinovna, born Dieterichs (1859–1927), was trustee of the Free Word Press and produced several texts for both arms of the business.\n\nThe Purleigh group began to split up towards the end of 1900, at which point Chertkov moved with his family and followers to Tuckton House, at Tuckton in Bournemouth, purchased for him by his mother. The group used the defunct waterworks in nearby Iford Lane as their printing works, and continued to churn out Free Word and Free Age Press texts until July 1908, when most of the colony returned with Chertkov to Russia. (The Tsar had granted a pardon to all political exiles three years previously.) The Free Age Press continued to flourish, with a single member of the Tolstoy colony based at Tuckton House as translator and editor, until 1916. There was, of course, less and less appetite for Tolstoy's mainly pacifist writings as Britain drifted into war. Chertkov remained in Russia where, as Tolstoy's literary executor, he was editor-in-chief of one last project: a complete edition of Tolstoy's works in Russian, which ultimately extended to ninety volumes, and was still in motion when Chertkov died in Moscow, after a series of strokes, in 1936. He is buried in Vvedenskoye Cemetery.\n\nActor Paul Giamatti portrayed Chertkov in the 2009 film \"The Last Station\".\n\n\n"}

The newest location opened on September 18, 2019 in Paramus, NJ.\n\nCharles Leonard, a hatter in a sweatshop, founded Clover Farms Dairy in Norwalk, CT, in the early 1920s.\n\nIn 1969, Stew Leonard opened the Clover Farms Dairy store in Norwalk.\n\nStew Leonard acquired land for a second store in Danbury, CT, in the mid-1980s. The store opened in 1991.\n\nStew Leonard's announced plans to open a store in Yonkers, NY, in 1997. The store opened in September 1999.\n\nThe Leonard family began working to open a store on Long Island, in 2002. However, plans to open a store across from the Republic Airport in Farmingdale, NY fell through. In 2015, Stew Leonard's announced plans to open a store in Farmingdale in early 2016; the store opened in January 2016.\n\nA store in Newington, Connecticut was announced in February 2006 and opened in April 2007.\n\nIn 1993, Stew Leonard, Sr. was convicted of having committed tax fraud via an elaborate scheme to divert more than $17.1 million in cash register receipts over a 10-year period. The fraud, which involved a computer program designed to skim off sales, was directed by Stew Leonard, Sr., in concert with the company's CFO and store manager. Skimmed cash was placed in bundles in Leonard, Sr.'s office fireplace, to be later moved offshore or disguised as gifts. Leonard, Sr. was caught in June 1991 carrying $80,000 cash \"en route\" to the island of Saint Martin.\n\nLeonard, Sr. pled guilty to the charges and, in 1993, was sentenced to 52 months in prison. He ultimately served 44 months before being released in June 1997.\n\nIn 1993, shortly after Stew Leonard, Sr. and three other company executives had pled guilty in the tax fraud case, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection charged Stew Leonard's with short-weighting customers on multiple products. The department measured a 47% violation rate, compared with a statewide average of 7.2%. Stew Leonard, Jr. and Tom Leonard denied that these actions were intentional and claimed, \"a larger percentage of products checked were, in fact, overweight than underweight\", and, \"we corrected every [mistake] before the inspector even left the store.\"\n\nThere are currently three stores in Connecticut:\nThere are currently three stores in New York:\nThere is currently one store in New Jersey:\n\n\"The New York Times\" called Stew Leonard's the \"Disneyland of Dairy Stores.\" The stores are not set up like traditional grocery stores; the aisle configurations guide customers to walk through the entire store (although there are short cuts). As customers walk through the aisles, they are greeted by various employees dressed up in costumes and by animatronic characters, called the \"Farm Fresh Five\", that perform songs and dance. The stores also feature petting zoos and outdoor cafes in the warmer months, and offer tasting booths and a variety of prepared meals year round.\n\n\"Anyone who comes from Connecticut or thereabouts knows this landmark chain of grocery stores where mechanized cows sing and roosters crow,\" according to a writer for the \"Sun-Sentinel\" of Florida.\n\nThe store is notable for its customer service policy, which greets shoppers at each store's entrance, etched into a three-ton rock:\n\n1.

Other areas affected may include the lymph nodes, the lining of the abdomen, diaphragm, spleen, liver, chest wall, skull, spinal cord, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, brain, lungs, testicles, ovaries, and the pelvis. Reported sites of metastatic spread include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, brain, skull, and bones. It is characterized by the EWS-WT1 fusion protein.\n\nThe tumor is classified as a soft tissue sarcoma and a small round blue cell tumor. It most often occurs in male children. The disease rarely occurs in females, but when it does the tumors can be mistaken for ovarian cancer.\n\nThere are few early warning signs that a patient has a DSRCT. Patients are often young and healthy as the tumors grow and spread uninhibited within the abdominal cavity. These are rare tumors and symptoms are often misdiagnosed by physicians. The abdominal masses can grow to enormous size before being noticed by the patient. The tumors can be felt as hard, round masses by palpating the abdomen.\n\nFirst symptoms of the disease often include abdominal distention, abdominal mass, abdominal or back pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, lack of appetite, ascites, anemia, and cachexia.\n\nOther reported symptoms include unknown lumps, thyroid conditions, hormonal conditions, blood clotting, kidney and urological problems, testicle, breast, uterine, vaginal, and ovarian masses.\n\nThere are no known risk factors that have been identified specific to the disease. The tumor appears to arise from the primitive cells of childhood, and is considered a childhood cancer.\n\nResearch has indicated that there is a chimeric relationship between DSRCT and Wilms' tumor and Ewing sarcoma. Together with neuroblastoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they form the small-cell tumors.\n\nDSRCT is associated with a unique chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(p13:q12) resulting in an \"EWS\"-\"WT1\" fusion transcript that is diagnostic of this tumor. This transcript codes for a protein that includes the N-terminal transactivation domain of EWSR1 and the DNA-binding domain of WT1.\n\nThe EWS/WT1 translocation product targets ENT4. ENT4 is also known as PMAT.\n\nThe entity was first described by pathologists William L. Gerald and Juan Rosai in 1989. Pathology reveals well circumscribed solid tumor nodules within a dense desmoplastic stroma. Often areas of central necrosis are present. Tumor cells have hyperchromatic nuclei with increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.\n\nOn immunohistochemistry, these cells have trilinear coexpression including the epithelial marker cytokeratin, the mesenchymal markers desmin and vimentin, and the neuronal marker neuron-specific enolase. Thus, although initially thought to be of mesothelial origin due to sites of presentation, it is now hypothesized to arise from a progenitor cell with multiphenotypic differentiation.\n\nBecause this is a rare tumor, not many family physicians or oncologists are familiar with this disease. DSRCT in young patients can be mistaken for other abdominal tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and mesenteric carcinoid. In older patients DSRCT can resemble lymphoma, peritoneal mesothelioma, and peritoneal carcinomatosis. In males DSRCT may be mistaken for germ cell or testicular cancer while in females DSRCT can be mistaken for Ovarian cancer. DSRCT shares characteristics with other small-round blue cell cancers including Ewing's sarcoma, acute leukemia, small cell mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Wilms' tumor.\n\nDSRCT is frequently misdiagnosed. Adult patients should always be referred to a sarcoma specialist. This is an aggressive, rare, fast spreading tumor and both pediatric and adult patients should be treated at a sarcoma center.\n\nThere is no standard protocol for the disease; however, recent journals and studies have reported that some patients respond to high-dose (P6 Protocol) chemotherapy, maintenance chemotherapy, debulking operation, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation therapy. Other treatment options include: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, stereotactic body radiation therapy, intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion, and clinical trials.\n\nThe prognosis for DSRCT remains poor. Prognosis depends upon the stage of the cancer. Because the disease can be misdiagnosed or remain undetected, tumors frequently grow large within the abdomen and metastasize or seed to other parts of the body.\n\nThere is no known organ or area of origin. DSRCT can metastasize through lymph nodes or the blood stream. Sites of metastasis include the spleen, diaphragm, liver, large and small intestine, lungs, central nervous system, bones, uterus, bladder, genitals, abdominal cavity, and the brain.\n\nA multi-modality approach of high-dose chemotherapy, aggressive surgical resection, radiation, and stem cell rescue improves survival for some patients. Reports have indicated that patients will initially respond to first line chemotherapy and treatment but that relapse is common.\n\nSome patients in remission or with inoperable tumor seem to benefit from long term low dose chemotherapy, turning DSRCT into a chronic disease.\n\nThe Stehlin Foundation currently offers DSRCT patients the opportunity to send samples of their tumors free of charge for testing. Research scientists are growing the samples on nude mice and testing various chemical agents to find which are most effective against the individual's tumor.\n\nPatients with advanced DSRCT may qualify to participate in clinical trials that are researching new drugs to treat the disease.\n\nThe Cory Monzingo Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that supports the research for treatments and a cure for DSRCT. The Cory Monzingo Foundation provides funding to MD Anderson Cancer Center and may also provide funding to other nonprofit cancer research organizations.\n\nIn 2002, Nishio and al, established a novel human tumor cell line derived from the pleural effusion of a patient with a typical intra-abdominal DSRCT, called JN-DSRCT-1 that can now be used in research.\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has, in 2018, make available resources from the Childhood Solid Tumor Network, that upon request gives access to patient-derived orthotopic xenografts.\n\nThis disease is also known as: desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor; intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor; desmoplastic small cell tumor; desmoplastic cancer; desmoplastic sarcoma; DSRCT.\n\nThere is no connection to peritoneal mesothelioma which is another disease sometimes described as desmoplastic.\n\n"}

He was one of the foremost realists of his generation who closely upheld the mantle of his mentor, Robert Henri.\n\nSpeicher was born in Buffalo, New York. He began his studies in art at the Albright Art School. He moved to New York in 1907 and began attending the Art Students League where he studied with William Merritt Chase and Frank Vincent Du Mond. In 1908, he won the school's Kelley Prize with a portrait of fellow student Georgia O'Keeffe. In 1909 took life classes with Robert Henri at the New York School of Art, which he found of great importance to his formative style. Through Henri, with whom he became close friends, he also became acquainted with George Bellows, with whom he also became close, and with Rockwell Kent, Edward Hopper, Guy Pène du Bois, Leon Kroll, and a coterie of realist artists with whom he associated. In 1910, he went to Europe, where he remained for two years to study the Old Masters in Paris, the Netherlands, and Spain. Upon his return, he settled in New York, and soon became known as one of the most promising of the younger group of American painters. He discovered Woodstock, New York, soon after and began to split his time between Manhattan and Woodstock, where he became an important and popular figure in the art colony.\n\nFrom the teens, Speicher began to receive a steady stream of awards and honors. By the 1920s Speicher was considered a leading portrait artist in America, practicing a form of realism. Among the awards he received was the Beck Gold medal for portraiture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia in January 1920, for his painting \"Russian Girl\". In 1926 he was awarded the Potter Palmer Gold medal at the Art Institute of Chicago for \"The Lace Scarf\". In 1936 \"Esquire\" magazine called him America's most important living painter. He was also awarded the Temple Gold Medal at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1938 for \"Marianna\".\n\nRecognized for his work in portraiture, Speicher’s renown allowed him to support himself with commissions, and he also executed many flower still lifes and landscapes. Always favoring female subjects, he was also one of the few moderns to undertake nudes for which he became known. With a strong technique and great capability as a draughtsman, Speicher’s compositions are analytical and methodical in their design and execution.\n\nHe was nominated an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1912 and a full academician in 1925. Speicher was appointed director of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1945.\n\n\n\n"}

Best known for his stage work and television roles in teleplays and series, he also appeared briefly on radio and in film.\nHepton was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire and said he was born in the same street as J.B. Priestley thirty years earlier. His father, Bernard senior, was an electrician, while his mother Hilda (née Berrington) was from a mill-working family. Brought up as a Catholic (which he remained as an adult), he attended St Bede's Grammar School in the city. His short-sight meant he was unable to serve in the army during the Second World War, but he trained as an aircraft engineer and draughtsman while undertaking firewatching duties.\n\nHepton trained at the Bradford Civic Playhouse under director Esme Church. He had extensive stage experience as an actor in repertory, especially in Scarborough and York. In 1952, he joined Birmingham Rep under Barry Jackson, later himself becoming the theatre's artistic director in 1957. Later, for a brief period from 1963, he was director of the Liverpool Playhouse, but resigned during his first season. Productions of the Max Frisch play \"The Fire Raisers\" and John Osborne's \"Luther\" were not well-received locally because of their content. He was responsible for orchestrating the fight sequences in Laurence Olivier's film version of \"Richard III\" (1955) and an Old Vic production of \"Hamlet\" with lead Richard Burton in 1953.\n\nOn television, he played Caiaphas in the 1969 Dennis Potter play \"Son of Man\". He was cast as the Kommandant in \"Colditz\" (1972–74) and later appeared for the same production team as Albert Foiret in three seasons of \"Secret Army\" (1977–79). Before that he made a guest appearance in an episode of the first series of \"Catweazle\" (1970) where he played a naturalist. Other notable performances included Thomas Cranmer in both \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" (1970) and \"Elizabeth R\" (1971). He reprised the role in the film adaptation of the former, \"Henry VIII and His Six Wives\" (1972). Hepton acted in adaptations of John le Carré's novels, as Toby Esterhase in the BBC Television versions of \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" and \"Smiley's People\", and George Smiley in the radio adaptations. He appeared in \"I, Claudius\" (1976) as Pallas and in the comedy series \"The Squirrels\" (1974–77).\n\nHaving played Inspector Goole in \"An Inspector Calls\" (1982) and Sir Thomas Bertram in \"Mansfield Park\" (1983), he appeared as Sam Toovey in the 1989 television adaptation of Susan Hill's ghost story \"The Woman in Black\" (1989).\n\nOn radio, Hepton played the role of Albert, in \"Stranger in the Home\" by Alan Dapre, also the role of \"The Old Man in the Corner\", the amateur, and mostly sedentary, sleuth in the BBC dramatisations of \"The Teahouse Detective\" (1998–2000) by Baroness Orczy. He also starred in Robert Barr's quirky detective radio series \"Galbraith\" as Inspector Bill Galbraith on BBC radio.\n\nHepton's appearances in feature films were less frequent, he made his debut in 1949. He made a brief appearance as Thorpey, a gangster, in the classic British film \"Get Carter\" (1971), and another small role, as Milton Goldsmith, in \"Voyage of the Damned\" (1976).\n\nHepton was married to actress Nancie Jackson from 1957 until she died in 1977.

When talking about poetry written in English the term is arguably of limited significance or utility, at least by comparison to its antonym, catalectic, for the simple reason that acatalexis is considered to be the \"usual case\" in the large majority of metrical contexts and therefore explicit reference to it proves almost universally superfluous.\n\nFor example, to describe Shakespeare's sonnets as having been written in \"iambic pentameter acatalectic\" would be factually accurate, but redundant and never said, because iambic pentameter is presumed to be acatalectic unless specified as being catalectic. However, in very rare contexts where catalexis might be considered probable (e.g., in English trochaic tetrameter, or in differentiating acatalectic verses from surrounding catalectic ones), explicit expression of the verse's metrical completeness may be achieved by using the term. When talking about poems published in languages other than English, the term might prove itself more useful. For example in Polish poetry acatalectic iambic lines are unusual, because feminine ending is dominant. Thus iambic pentameter in Polish is not 10-syllable long but almost always 11-syllable long.\n\n"}

A Skrull, she possesses the ability to shapeshift into almost any humanoid or animal form. Modifications on her body give her the power to generate energy blasts.\n\nLyja first appeared in \"Fantastic Four\" #357 (October 1991), and was created by Tom DeFalco and Paul Ryan. She was revealed to have been impersonating Alicia Masters ever since \"Fantastic Four\" #265 (April 1984). Lyja remained a supporting character in the series until the launch of the \"Heroes Reborn\" storyline in 1996. She returned in a tie-in to the \"Secret Invasion\" limited series in 2008.\n\nThe Skrull Empire—longtime enemies of the Fantastic Four—embarked on a plan to infiltrate the team by impersonating Alicia Masters—blind sculptor and love interest of Benjamin Grimm (the Thing). The author of the plan, Paibok the Power Skrull, selected the warrior Lyja to be the spy and espionage agent—possibly as retribution because they had once had a failed affair. Nevertheless, Lyja trained extensively to pull off the disguise, even using contact lenses to make herself blind in human form to learn how to navigate the world as Alicia did.\n\nSoon after Lyja's arrival on Earth, a near-omnipotent being known as the Beyonder kidnapped numerous super-powered beings (including three members of the Fantastic Four), transporting them to a makeshift Battleworld, where they participated in a series of \"Secret Wars\" between the so-called forces of good and evil. Lyja took the opportunity of their distraction to replace Alicia, greeting the Fantastic Four on their return to Earth from Battleworld. The Skrull plan almost hit a snag when Lyja discovered that the Thing opted to remain on Battleworld at the end of the war, instead of returning home to Earth. Lyja instead seduced Johnny Storm, the Human Torch. When the Thing learned that Johnny and \"Alicia\" were lovers, they became estranged. Lyja fell in love with Johnny and eventually they were married under the false pretense of her as Alicia Masters.\n\nEventually Alicia's stepfather, the villain known as the Puppet Master, realized that the woman claiming to be his stepdaughter was an imposter, and took his suspicions to the Thing. Lyja was forced by the Thing to transform back to her true Skrull appearance. She disclosed her true identity, as well as the fact that the real Alicia was a captive of the Skrulls. She aided the Fantastic Four in finding the real Alicia Masters in the Skrull Empire, but was believed to be slain when she threw herself in the path of a blast which Paibok had meant for the Human Torch.\n\nIn actuality, Paibok recovered Lyja and revealed to Devos the Devastator that she was still alive. Paibok, with the assistance of Devos, awoke Lyja from her comatose state, and bestowed her with the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands becoming \"Lyja the Lazerfist\". These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted into her. Joining them in search of vengeance, the three arrived on Earth, and isolated and battled the Torch at Empire State University. Panicking, the Torch burst into his Nova Flame and destroyed the campus. Alongside Devos and Paibok, Lyja witnessed a battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Four.\n\nLyja then first encountered Aron the Watcher, and aided the Fantastic Four against Doctor Doom. Alongside the Fantastic Four, Lyja battled Devos, Paibok, Klaw, and Huntara. Lyja impersonated Bridget O'Neil, and became jealous on discovering Johnny Storm's affection for Bridget.\n\nAfter returning to the Fantastic Four and Johnny, Lyja claimed she was pregnant with Johnny's child. Over time, Lyja and Johnny began to grow close again. When Lyja delivered the \"child\" (an egg), the implant that gave her the \"Lazerfist\" powers was also removed, returning Lyja to an ordinary Skrull with no extra powers beyond her shapeshifting. The implant was subsequently absorbed by a normal human, apparently an electronics expert named Raphael Suarez, who gained the \"Lazerfist\" powers, and attempted to contact the Fantastic Four for their assistance but after the hectic events that followed the hatching of the \"egg\", Raphael wandered off, realizing the Fantastic Four were not going to be of any help in their current state, and has not been referenced since.\n\nAlthough Lyja and Johnny were growing close, Lyja was continuously torn about telling Johnny something. She was too scared to risk shattering the bonds they had managed to form again, and kept putting it off. Ultimately, it was too late. The \"egg\" was revealed, not to be their child, but rather a Skrull bio-weapon, which Lyja subsequently destroyed after it hatched. Johnny, enraged at being betrayed and deceived again by Lyja, broke things off with her again.\n\nLyja was still in love with Johnny and stalked him while as a human, Laura Green. Johnny was initially interested in a fellow college student but when he realized nothing was going to materialize with her his focus shifted to Laura/Lyja. Lyja, having learned her lessons well, eventually decided to reveal herself before Johnny felt betrayed again. After sharing a kiss with Laura, Johnny already knew that his ex-wife was in fact Laura Green.\nDuring the Onslaught crisis when Lyja was injured she attempted to tell Johnny the truth but he informed her that he already knew. The couple seemed to be on track to reconciling their relationship until the Fantastic Four were presumed dead after a devastating fight with Onslaught, and as a result, Lyja left to attempt a normal life, masquerading again as a human woman. Soon after the Fantastic Four's were revealed to have survived the fight with Onslaught, Johnny mentions that he can not locate Lyja.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, Lyja poses as the Invisible Woman in order to send the Baxter Building to the Negative Zone. She reveals herself to her former spouse and attacks him, feeling angry that he had forgotten her. During the course of their battle, Johnny saves Lyja from being hit by a police car, pulled in through the portal. The two reconcile after that, but a Negative Zone creature attacks them. They manage to defeat the creature, but Lyja passes out from her injuries. Some time later, when the \"new\" Fantastic Four fly off to the prison, Franklin and Valeria are grabbed by multiple Negative Zone creatures, however Lyja saves them. She informs Johnny that she had been working in a book store when a Skrull approached her, insisting she join them. They attempted to convince her to help them blow up the Baxter Building, but instead she sends the Fantastic Four to the Negative Zone, in hopes of keeping them from harm's way. When Ben, Johnny, Franklin, Val and the Tinkerer were ready to leave the Negative Zone, she refused to leave, as she wanted to stay behind and find out who she really was.\n\nLyja later appeared as an ally of the Future Foundation, helping them in locating the scattered atomic remnants of the Molecule Man. Having assumed the identity of Yondu Udonta to escape persecution for being a Skrull, she helped Foundation member Julie Power infiltrate a galactic prison where one of these renmants (which was attached to Rikki Barnes) was located. She later killed Kl'Rath, a Zn'rx ally of The Maker, for him having killed innocent Skrull children, impersonated him and helped in thwarting The Maker's plans. Upon Alex Power's invitation, she subsequently joined the Future Foundation.\n\nLyja's Deviant Skrull heritage gives her the ability to change size, shape, and color at will, taking on the appearance but not the characteristics of other beings and objects. Skrulls cannot duplicate the superhuman powers of the beings they use their shape-shifting powers to impersonate.\n\nFor a brief time, because of genetic alteration (later revealed to be an implant) by Paibok the Power Skrull, Lyja had the ability to project blasts of laser-like beams called her \"bio-blasts\" from her hands without harm to herself. She could suspend herself in the air by firing her bio-blasts beneath her. These powers were lost when her body rejected the power-generating implant during her giving \"birth\".\n\nLyja wears body armor of unspecified materials. She wore special contact lenses that rendered her blind while she impersonated Alicia Masters.\n\nLyja has been trained in armed and unarmed combat by the Skrull military. She is also trained in acting and educated in Earth culture and history and the English language by Skrull tutors. She is also talented as a creator of abstract sculpture.\n\nIn the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, she regained her energy powers through unspecified means, as well as the ability to resist the incredible levels of heat and flame the Human Torch can generate. Lyja has also been seen manifesting dragon-like wings through her shape-shifting powers, enabling her to fly.\n\nLyja appears in the Marvel Zombies Universe on a planet besieged by the Zombie Galactus - consisting of zombie versions of Giant-Man, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine and Hulk during a \"Black Panther\" crossover. Here she possesses the power of the Invisible Woman as part of an experiment following the death of the Super-Skrull in this universe; unable to replicate the Super-Skrull, the Fantastic Four's powers were instead given to four different Skrulls. She is loyal to the Skrulls and seems insulted when the Johnny Storm of the regular Marvel Universe - who has been transported into this universe with the 'new' Fantastic Four of the Torch, the Thing, the Black Panther and Storm - admits to knowing her.\n\nShe is shortly thereafter infected with the zombie virus, along with the rest of her team. During the subsequent conflict between the zombie-Skrull-Fantastic Four and the new Fantastic Four, she is decapitated by a vibranium dagger thrown by the Black Panther, and her head is subsequently destroyed by Black Panther before she can bite Johnny after she lands near his ankle.\n\nIn the MC2 universe, Lyja is once again married to the Human Torch and is a member of the Fantastic Five, under the name Ms. Fantastic. The couple has a son, Torus Storm, who inherited both Lyja's shape-shifting abilities and the Torch's flame powers. She remains active among the Fantastic Five and is sporadically seen in the \"Spider-Girl\" series and related mini-series. Spider-Girl mentions in their first encounter that if she was not fighting Lyja she would probably ask for her autograph, as she was a fan.\n\nLyja is introduced within the \"Skrulls vs. Power Pack\" miniseries as a young Skrull who is impersonating Katie Power, as well as being a commander under the orders of Warpriest Kh'oja in which he framed the Power siblings by stealing special treasures from Patchworld.\n\n\n"}

In the 1980 Tour de France he won the young rider classification, also placing 12th in the general classification that year. He had been a racing cyclist for only a year. In the 1981 Tour de France he took first place on the second and 21st stages, finishing 12th overall for the second year. He rode with TI–Raleigh in the Tour de France from 1979 to 1983, and the Panasonic team where he won Stage 5 and wore the Yellow Jersey for two days in the 1986 Tour de France.\n\nHe was distinctive in the peloton for his lean, long-legged appearance, his smooth pedalling style and his long hair. He rode in support of riders such as Joop Zoetemelk, whom he could pace over mountains at impressive speed, but he was also capable of winning on his own. Success came to him early and, he said in an interview with the author Jan Siebelink (\"Pijn is genot\") that he had trouble coping when that success began to dry up. Van der Velde said he remembered shivering at the start of an Italian race, the skin of his arms wrinkled in goosebumps, because of the amphetamine he had taken just to start.\n\nAddiction to amphetamine and a lifelong habit of petty theft, which he said came from seeing his father bring home things he had stolen from work, brought him into trouble with the law. He was caught stealing lawnmowers and breaking into post office stamp machines to raise money to cover his addiction and his gambling. The jail sentence and the loss of all he had won forced him and his Belgian wife, Josée, to sell the villa they had owned. They moved into a series of anonymous houses and apartments. Van der Velde began hospital treatment for his addiction and became deeply religious. He began work on building sites, rarely saying who he was or what he had been, to rebuild his self-esteem. For many years he tried to keep his address and his identity secret.\n\nVan der Velde is now often seen at junior races, where he accompanies his son, also a racer. He took part in a celebrity edition of the \"Big Brother\" television series in 2000 and has worked in public relations for the Quickstep team, driving its guests at races. It was announced that van der Velde would join the new as a driver for 2015.\n\nHis manager at Ti-Raleigh, Peter Post, said he had always considered Van der Velde the son that he had never had.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2296242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296242", "title": "Catalectic", "text": "Catalectic\n\nA catalectic line is a metrically incomplete line of verse, lacking a syllable at the end or ending with an incomplete foot. One form of catalexis is headlessness, where the unstressed syllable is dropped from the beginning of the line.\n\nA line missing two syllables is called brachycatalectic.\n\nPoems can be written entirely in catalectic lines, or entirely in acatalectic (complete) lines, or a mixture, as the following carol, composed by Cecil Frances Alexander in 1848:\n\nIt has been argued that across a number of Indo-European languages, when the two types of line are mixed in this way, the shorter line tends to be used as a coda at the end of a period or stanza.\n\nIt has been argued that catalexis can be divided into two types. (Here \"x\" stands for an \"anceps\" syllable.)\n\nAn example of a blunt line becoming pendant in catalexis is Goethe's poem Heidenröslein, or, in the same metre, the English carol Good King Wenceslas:\n\nAnother example is the children's song Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, of which the first stanza ends as follows:\n\nIn all of these songs, when they are set to music, there is a lengthening of the penultimate syllable in order to equalise the two lines. However, there is not enough evidence to tell if a similar phenomenon occurred in Ancient Greek.\n\nWhen a poem is doubly catalectic (brachycatalectic), that is, shortened by two syllables, a blunt ending remains blunt:\n\nIn languages which use quantitative metres, such as Latin, Ancient Greek, Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit, the final syllable of any line is \"anceps\", that is, indifferently long or short. According to one view dating back to ancient times, even if the final syllable is prosodically short, it counts as long because of the pause which follows it (see brevis in longo). Thus any line ending – u –, when catalectic, becomes – x.\n\nAn example in Ancient Greek is the iambic tetrameter, which in normal and catalectic form is as follows:\n\nIn classical Arabic, the most commonly used metre, the \"ṭawīl\", has normal and catalectic forms as follows:\n\nA similar phenomenon is also found in classical Persian. For example, the metre based on the choriamb pattern (– u u –) has a shortened form as follows:\n\nCatalexis was common in Greek and Latin meter, and also in ancient Sanskrit verse. Catalectic endings are particularly common where the rhythm of the verse is dactylic ( – u u ), trochaic ( – u ), or anapestic ( u u – ); they tend to be associated with the end of a strophe or period, so much so that it can almost be said that acatalectic forms cannot end a period. In classical verse, the final syllable of a line always counted as long, so that if a dactyl ( – u u ) is made catalectic, it becomes a spondee ( – – ).\n\nAncient poetry was often performed to music, and the question arises of what music accompanied a catalectic ending. A few ancient Greek poems survive with authentic musical notation. Four of these are by Mesomedes (early 2nd century CE). Secondary sources of Mesomedes' poems To Helios and To Nemesis are in a catalectic meter known as apokrota \"sonorous.\" In each case, in place of the missing short element of the text (i.e., missing syllable) one often finds lengthening signs. In two cases in To Helios, this appears to be a three-note melisma. It is possible ancient use of catalexis indicated some form of melody or continued singing in place of the missing syllables.\n\nIn ancient Greek drama, catalectic meters may have been associated with a male aulete or had some other special use. For example, of Menander's surviving plays, almost all are in iambic trimeters. He changed the meter in one long scene in Misanthrope to 15-syllable catalectic iambic tetrameter recited to an aulos accompaniment.\n\nPoem 25 by Catullus is in iambic tetrameter catalectic. Of Catullus' extant 114 or so poems and fragments, this meter appears only in this poem.\n\nVenantius Fortunatus' hymn \"Pange lingua\" is in trochaic tetrameter catalectic—the meter of the marching chants of the Roman armies. The hymn is one of the oldest with surviving musical notation.\n\nAs Greek meter is often used to describe musical phrasing, some famous themes include:\n\n"}

Founded in 1817, Johnsons is a provider of specialist dry cleaning, key cutting and photo services across 198 branches in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe origins of the dry cleaning business go back to 1817 when Johnson Brothers started in business in Liverpool as silk dyers.\n\nIn 1920, Johnson Brothers joined forces in amalgamation with two dry cleaning companies, Jas Smith & Son and Flinn & Son Ltd of Brighton.\nFurther expansion of the Group took place over the next sixty years until Johnsons became the largest dry cleaning organisation in the country.\n\nIn 1974, they purchased Kneels (Devon and Cornwall's) dry cleaning chain.\n\nAt the start of 1980s, larger branches sub let spaces within their stores for concessions, these were mostly either Klick Photopoint or key cutting company \"Mister Minit\"\n\nIn 1985, they were the victim of a hostile take over by their biggest competitor Sketchley, but the takeover bid ultimately failed.\n\nJohnson Cleaners UK Ltd (JCUK) was formed in 1995 when the twelve operating companies, which made up the Johnson Group in the UK at that time, were restructured into just two companies.\n\nIn 1997, Klick Photopoint decided to start moving their concessions out of Johnsons and into their own shop premises, initially Johnsons decided to replace Klick with Mister Minit concessions, However they soon changed their mind about this. \nIn May 1998, Mister Minit bought Sketchley Dry Cleaners, which then made Mister Minit their main competitor. Following this takeover, Johnsons started kicking Mister Minit out of their branches and replacing them with rival shoe repair company Timpsons.\nIn 2000, they took over their largest commercial laundry rival Seamara Group (Sketchley's former holding company prior to 1998).\n\nApril 2003 Minit UK PLC (owners of Mister Minit and Sketchley) were taken over by Timpsons, by this transaction Johnsons had a new enemy within their branches to contend with, just like in May 1998 when Mister Minit bought Sketchley, but now there was no other rival multiple shoe repair company they could put into their branches to replace Timpsons.\n\nIn 2004, they held talks with Morrisons about buying Safeway's Dry Cleaning Business, but when talks failed; they purchased Sketchley (the UK's second-largest dry cleaner) from Timpson instead. The Sketchley shops were rebranded as Johnsons in 2007.\n\nAlong with the acquisition of Sketchley, they inherited the Jeeves of Belgravia (London's upmarket dry cleaning) brand.\n\nIn 2006, the JSG (Johnson Service Group) decided to put the chain of 550 dry cleaning stores up for sale, they told the media that the retail division accounted for less than 25% of their annual profits and they had decided to concentrate on their commercial laundry, textile rental and work wear businesses instead, but despite some equity groups looking at the retail arms accounts; no bid was ever made for the dry cleaning shops.\n\nIn 2010, they launched Green Earth Dry Cleaning Branding across all their shops.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Johnsons announced the closure of over 100 underperforming stores.\n\nIn January 2015, they announced the closure of 109 of their 307 remaining branches; the reason given was the 109 shops' leases had come to an end and it would not be viable to renew them.

{"id": "2296257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296257", "title": "Roger Revelle", "text": "Roger Revelle\n\nRoger Randall Dougan Revelle (March 7, 1909 – July 15, 1991) was a scientist and scholar who was instrumental in the formative years of the University of California San Diego and was among the early scientists to study anthropogenic global warming, as well as the movement of Earth's tectonic plates. UC San Diego's first college is named Revelle College in his honor.\n\nRoger Revelle was born in Seattle to William Roger Revelle and Ella Dougan. He grew up in southern California. After graduating from Pomona College in 1929 with early studies in geology, he earned a PhD in oceanography from the University of California, Berkeley in 1936. While at Cal, he studied under George Louderback and was initiated into Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity, which started as a mining engineering fraternity and maintained a strong affinity for geology and geological engineering students. Much of his early work in oceanography took place at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) in San Diego. He was also oceanographer for the Navy during WWII. He was director of SIO from 1950 to 1964. He stood against the UC faculty being required to take an anti-communist oath during the Joseph McCarthy period. He served as Science Advisor to Interior Secretary Stewart Udall during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s and was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1974).\n\nRevelle was deeply involved in the growth of oceanography in the United States and internationally after World War II. Working for the Navy in the late 1940s, he helped to determine which projects gained funding. He also promoted the idea that the Navy ought to support \"basic research\" instead of only trying to build new technology. At Scripps he launched several major long-range expeditions in the 1950s, including the MIDPAC, TRANSPAC (with Canada and Japan), EQUAPAC, and NORPAC, each traversing a different part of the Pacific Ocean. He and other scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography helped the U.S. government to plan nuclear weapons tests, in the hope that oceanographers might make use of the data. Revelle was one of the committee chairmen in the influential National Academy of Sciences studies of the biological effects of atomic radiation (BEAR), the results of which were published in 1956. In 1952, along with Dr. Seibert Q. Duntley, he successfully moved the MIT Visibility Lab to SIO with financial support of the U.S. Navy. Along with oceanographers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Revelle planned the American contributions to the oceanographic program of the International Geophysical Year (IGY). He became the first president of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research, an international group of scientists devoted to advising on international projects, and was a frequent adviser to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, created in 1960.\n\nRevelle was instrumental in creating the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1958 and was founding chairman of the first Committee on Climate Change and the Ocean (CCCO) under the Scientific Committee on Ocean Research (SCOR) and the International Oceanic Commission (IOC). During planning for the IGY, under Revelle's directorship, SIO participated in and later became the principal center for the Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Program. In July 1956, Charles David Keeling joined the SIO staff to head the program and began measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa Observatory on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and in Antarctica.\n\nHans Suess was recruited by Revelle, and they co-authored a 1957 article using carbon-14 isotope levels to assess the rate at which carbon dioxide added by fossil fuel combustion since the start of the industrial revolution had accumulated in the atmosphere. They concluded that most of it had been absorbed by the Earth's oceans, contrary to the assumption made by early geoscientists (Chamberlin, Arhenius and Callendar) that it would simply accumulate in the upper atmosphere to \"lower the mean level of back radiation in the infrared and thereby increase the average temperature near the Earth's surface\". There had been little sign to date of this greenhouse effect causing the anticipated warming, but the Suess–Revelle article suggested that increasing human gas emissions might change this. They said that \"human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future\". Revelle told journalists about the issues and testified to Congress that \"The Earth itself is a space ship\", endangered by rising seas and desertification. A November 1957 report in \"The Hammond Times\" described his research as suggesting that \"a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result\" – the first use of the term \"global warming\". A biographer of Suess later said that, although other articles in the same journal discussed carbon-dioxide levels, the Suess–Revelle article was \"the only one of the three to stress the growing quantity of contributed by our burning of fossil fuel, and to call attention to the fact that it might cause global warming over time\".\n\nRevelle and Suess described the \"buffer factor\", now known as the \"Revelle factor\", which is a resistance to atmospheric carbon dioxide being absorbed by the ocean surface layer posed by bicarbonate chemistry. Essentially, in order to enter the ocean, carbon dioxide gas has to partition into one of the components of carbonic acid: carbonate ion, bicarbonate ion, or protonated carbonic acid, and the product of these many chemical dissociation constants factors into a kind of back-pressure that limits how fast the carbon dioxide can enter the surface ocean. Geology, geochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, ocean chemistry ... this amounted to one of the earliest examples of \"integrated assessment\", which 50 years later became an entire branch of global-warming science.\n\nAt his death, Revelle may well have still been waiting for a signal that would prove global warming as a serious problem correct. In the November 1982 \"Scientific American\" Letters to the Editors, Revelle stated: \"We must conclude that until a warming trend that exceeds the noise level of natural climatic fluctuations becomes clearly evident, there will be considerable uncertainty and a diversity of opinions about the amplitude of the climatic effects of increased atmospheric CO. If the modelers are correct, such a signal should be detectable within the next 10 or 15 years.\"\n\nDuring the late 1950s, Revelle fought for the establishment of a University of California campus in San Diego. He had to contend with the UC University Board of Regents, who would have preferred merely to expand the University of California, Los Angeles campus rather than create an entirely new campus in San Diego. He also conflicted with San Diego politicians and businessmen who believed that the campus should be established in San Diego proper, such as near San Diego State University or in Balboa Park. The decision was made in 1959, with the first graduate students enrolled in 1960, and the first undergraduates in 1964.\n\nRevelle's struggle to acquire land for the new campus put him in competition with Jonas Salk, and Revelle lost some of what he called the \"best piece of land we had\" on UCSD's eventual Torrey Pines site to the fledgling Salk Institute. In later years Revelle continued to show some animosity toward Salk, once saying: \"He is a folk hero, even though he is... not very bright.\"\n\nWhen at Scripps and while building UCSD, Revelle also had to deal with a La Jolla community that refused to rent or sell property to Jews. In addition to battling the anti-semitic restrictive covenant of La Jolla real estate, Revelle helped found a new housing subdivision for Scripps professors, partially because some of them would not have been allowed to live in La Jolla.\n\nRevelle left Scripps in 1963 and founded the (now defunct) Center for Population Studies at Harvard University. In his over ten years there as its Director, he focused upon the application of science and technology to the problem of world hunger. In 1976 he returned to UC San Diego as Professor of Science, Technology and Public Affairs (STPA) in the school's political science department.\n\nIn 1991, Revelle's name appeared as co-author on an article written by physicist S. Fred Singer and electrical engineer Chauncey Starr for the publication \"Cosmos: A Journal of Emerging Issues\", titled \"What to do about greenhouse warming: Look before you leap\", which was published in the summer of 1992. The Cosmos article included the statement that \"Drastic, precipitous—and, especially, unilateral—steps to delay the putative greenhouse impacts can cost jobs and prosperity and increase the human costs of global poverty, without being effective. Stringent economic controls now would be economically devastating particularly for developing countries...\". The article concluded: \"The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time. There is little risk in delaying policy responses.\"\n\nThese particular statements and the bulk of the article, including the title, had been written and published a year earlier by S. Fred Singer as sole author. Singer's article stated that \"there is every expectation that scientific understanding will be substantially improved within the next decade\" and advocated against \"drastic\" and \"hastily-conceived\" action at the time without further scientific evidence. It does not, however, deny climate change or global warming.\n\nJustin Lancaster, Revelle's graduate student and teaching assistant at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography from 1981 until Revelle's death, says that Revelle was \"hoodwinked\" by Singer into adding his name to the article and that Revelle was \"intensely embarrassed that his name was associated\" with it. In 1992, Lancaster charged that Singer's actions were \"unethical\" and specifically designed to undercut then–Senator Al Gore's global warming policy stance; however, to end a lawsuit brought by Singer against Lancaster with support of the Center for Public Interest in Washington, D.C., Lancaster gave Singer a statement of apology, but refused to admit that anything he said was false. In 2006, prompted by Robert Balling and others continuing to state that Revelle actually wrote the article, Lancaster formally withdrew his retraction and reiterated his charges.\n\nWhen Gore was running for the vice-presidential nomination in 1992, \"The New Republic\" picked up on the contrast between the references to Revelle in Gore's book \"Earth in the Balance\" and the views in the \"Cosmos\" article that could now be attributed to Revelle. This was followed up by \"Newsweek\" and elsewhere in the media. Patrick Michaels boasted that the \"Cosmos\" article had been read into the Congressional Record. The issue was even raised by Admiral James Stockdale in the televised vice-presidential debate. Gore's response was to protest that Revelle's views in the article had been taken out of context.\n\nRoger's daughter, Carolyn Revelle, wrote:\n\nContrary to George Will's \"Al Gore's Green Guilt\" Roger Revelle—our father and the \"father\" of the greenhouse effect—remained deeply concerned about global warming until his death in July 1991. That same year he wrote: \"The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time.\" Will and other critics of Sen. Al Gore have seized these words to suggest that Revelle, who was also Gore's professor and mentor, renounced his belief in global warming. Nothing could be further from the truth. When Revelle inveighed against \"drastic\" action, he was using that adjective in its literal sense—measures that would cost trillions of dollars. Up until his death, he thought that extreme measures were premature. But he continued to recommend immediate prudent steps to mitigate and delay climatic warming. Some of those steps go well beyond anything Gore or other national politicians have yet to advocate. [...] Revelle proposed a range of approaches to address global warming. Inaction was not one of them. He agreed with the adage \"look before you leap\", but he never said \"sit on your hands\".\nDuring his last decade at UCSD and SIO, Revelle continued to work and teach. In the early 1980s, he taught undergraduate STPA seminars twice a year, in Energy and Development (mainly on problems in Africa), the Carbon Dioxide Problem (known now as the Global Warming problem), and Marine Policy.\nIn 1986 he won the Balzan Prize for Oceanography/Climatology.\nA 1990 heart attack forced him to move his course to the Scripps Institution from the Revelle College provost's office, where he continued to teach the Marine Policy program until his death the following year. In 1991, he was awarded the National Medal of Science by President George H. W. Bush (one of about 500 recipients in the 20th century). He remarked to a reporter: \"I got it for being the grandfather of the greenhouse effect.\"\n\nRevelle died in San Diego on July 15, 1991 from complications of cardiac arrest. He was survived by his wife, Ellen Clark Revelle (1910–2009), three daughters, and one son, William, as well as numerous grandchildren.\n\nIn his honor, a new research vessel at the Scripps Institution was named \"R/V Roger Revelle\". Also, the Ocean Studies Board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine created the Roger Revelle Commemorative Lecture series in memory of Revelle in 1999, featuring distinguished speakers on the themes of ocean science and public policy. Since 1992, the American Geophysical Union has annually awarded a prize in his honor, the Roger Revelle Medal, for outstanding contributions in atmospheric sciences.\n\n"}

The Alcaic stanza and the Sapphic stanza named for Alcaeus' contemporary, Sappho, are two important forms of Classical poetry. The Alcaic stanza consists of two Alcaic hendecasyllables, followed by an Alcaic enneasyllable and an Alcaic decasyllable.\n\nThe Alcaic stanza as used by Sappho and Alcaeus has the scheme ( where \"–\" is a longum, \"u\" a breve, and \"×\" an anceps):\n\nOne stanza consists of four lines; the first two lines are divided into two parts by a caesura after the fifth syllable. The metrical pattern of an Alcaic stanza would look like this:\n\nHorace frequently used the Alcaic stanza in his Odes, as can be seen from this example :\n\nAn English translation, which suggests the metre, is :\n\nA famous example of English Alcaics is Tennyson's \"Milton\":\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nO mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies,\nO skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity,\n</poem>\n\nThe Alcaic stanza was adapted to use in English and French during the Renaissance. It was very frequently used in Italian poetry of the 19th century, especially by Giosuè Carducci. As in English, the meter is accentual rather than quantitative.\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; font-style:italic\">\nPoi che un sereno vapor d’ambrosia\nda la tua còppa diffuso avvolsemi,\n</poem>\n\nIt was an historically important form in Hungarian poetry. In Polish poetry (in contrast to the Sapphic stanza which was extremely popular since the 16th century) Alcaics were used very rarely. Even in translation Horace's Alcaic stanzas were usually turned into different forms. An example (perhaps the only) of an Alcaic stanza in Polish original literature is Stanisław Trembecki's \"Ode to Adam Naruszewicz\":\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; font-style:italic\">\nO ty, kapłanie Delijskiego świętny,\nPrzeszłego wiadom, przyszłości pojętny\n</poem>\n\nTrembecki's verse is syllabic (11/11/9/10). There is no accentual metrical pattern.\n\nGerman has also used alcaics with some success. They were introduced by Klopstock, and used by Hölderlin, by Johann Heinrich Voss in his translations of Horace, by August Kopisch and other 19th century German poets.\n"}

Early in his career, he began a long association with Benjamin Britten, for whom he directed all but one of the composer's stage works, including all of the world premieres after 1954. He became associated with the English Opera Group in 1953. In the 1950s, he also worked for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London and later at Glyndebourne and at the English National Opera in the 1970s.

In Ireland it repealed the Test Act 1672 and the remaining Penal Laws which had been in force since the passing of the Disenfranchising Act of the Irish Parliament of 1728. Its passage followed a vigorous campaign that threatened insurrection led by Irish lawyer Daniel O'Connell. The British leaders, starting with the Prime Minister the Duke of Wellington and his top aide Robert Peel, although initially opposed, gave in to avoid civil strife. \n\nThe act permitted members of the Catholic Church to sit in the parliament at Westminster. O'Connell had won a seat in a by-election for Clare in 1828 against an Anglican. Under the then extant penal law, O'Connell, as a Catholic, was forbidden to take his seat in Parliament. Peel, the Home Secretary, until then was called \"Orange Peel\" because he always supported the Orange (anti-Catholic) position. Peel now concluded: \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger.\" Fearing a revolution in Ireland, Peel drew up the Catholic Relief Bill and guided it through the House of Commons. To overcome the vehement opposition of both the House of Lords and King George IV, the Duke of Wellington worked tirelessly to ensure passage in the House of Lords, and threatened to resign as Prime Minister if the King did not give Royal Assent.\n\nThe campaign for Catholic emancipation in Ireland, 1828–1829, was led by Daniel O'Connell (1775–1847), organiser of the Catholic Association, but many others were active as well, both for and against.\n\nAs Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1822 to 1828, the Marquess Wellesley (brother of the Duke of Wellington) played a critical role in setting the stage for the Catholic Emancipation Bill. His policy was one of reconciliation that sought to have the civil rights of Catholics restored while preserving those rights and considerations important to Protestants. He used force in securing law and order when riots threatened the peace, and he discouraged the public agitation of both the Protestant Orange Order and the Catholic Society of Ribbonmen.\n\nBishop John Milner was an English Catholic cleric and writer highly active in promoting Catholic emancipation until his death in 1826. He was a leader in anti-Enlightenment thought and had a significant influence in England as well as Ireland, and was involved in shaping the Catholic response to earlier efforts in Parliament to enact Catholic emancipation measures.\n\nMeanwhile, Ulster Protestants mobilised, after a delayed start, to stop emancipation. By late 1828, Protestants of all classes began to organise after the arrival of O'Connellite Jack Lawless who planned a series of pro-emancipation meetings and activities across Ulster. His move galvanised the Protestants to form clubs, distribute pamphlets and set up petition drives. However the Protestant protests were not well funded or coordinated and lacked critical support from the British government. After Catholic relief had been granted, the Protestant opposition divided along class lines. The aristocracy and gentry became quiescent while the middle and working classes showed dominance over Ulster's Catholics through Orange parades.\n\nThe Parliamentary Elections (Ireland) Act 1829 (10 Geo. IV, c. 8) which accompanied emancipation and received its Royal Assent on the same day, was the only major ‘security’ eventually required for it. This Act disenfranchised the minor landholders of Ireland, the so-called Forty Shilling Freeholders and raised fivefold the economic qualifications for voting. Starting in the initial relief granting the vote by the Irish Parliament in 1793, any man renting or owning land worth at least forty shillings (two pounds sterling), had been permitted to vote. Under the Act, this was raised to ten pounds.\n\nThe act also forbade the use of the episcopal titles already used by the Church of England (10 Geo. IV, c. 7, s. 24). It imposed a penalty of £100 on 'any person, not authorised by law, who should assume the title of any archbishop, bishop or dean' and extended the provisions to the 'assumption of ecclesiastical titles derived from any city, town, or place in England and Ireland, not being in an existing see'. This was reinforced with the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851, which threatened confiscation of property of anyone outside the \"united Church of England and Ireland\" to use any episcopal title \"of any city, town or place, or of any territory or district (under any designation or description whatsoever), in the United Kingdom\". The 1851 act was never enforced and was repealed in 1871. The other impositions in the act, such as admittance to Catholic religious orders and public processions being illegal, were repealed with the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1926.\n\nJ. C. D. Clark (1985) depicts England before 1828 as a nation in which the vast majority of the people believed in the divine right of kings, and the legitimacy of a hereditary nobility, and in the rights and privileges of the Anglican Church. In Clark's interpretation, the system remained virtually intact until it suddenly collapsed in 1828, because Catholic emancipation undermined its central symbolic prop, the Anglican supremacy. Clark argues that the consequences were enormous: \"The shattering of a whole social order...What was lost at that point... was not merely a constitutional arrangement, but the intellectual ascendancy of a worldview, the cultural hegemony of the old elite.\" Clark's interpretation has been widely debated in the scholarly literature, and almost every historian who has examined the issue has highlighted the substantial amount of continuity between the periods before and after 1828–1832.\n\nEric J. Evans (1996) emphasises that the political importance of emancipation was that it split the anti-reformers beyond repair and diminished their ability to block future reform laws, especially the great Reform Act of 1832. Paradoxically, Wellington's success in forcing through emancipation converted many Ultra-Tories to demand reform of Parliament. They saw that the votes of the rotten boroughs had given the government its majority. Therefore, it was an ultra-Tory, the Marquess of Blandford, who in February 1830 introduced the first major reform bill, calling for the transfer of rotten borough seats to the counties and large towns, the disfranchisement of non-resident voters, the preventing of Crown office-holders from sitting in Parliament, the payment of a salary to MPs, and the general franchise for men who owned property. The ultras believed that a widely based electorate could be relied upon to rally around anti-Catholicism.\n\nSome sections of the act remains in force in the United Kingdom; of these, some remain in force in England or Great Britain but were repealed with respect to Northern Ireland by the Statute Law Revision (Northern Ireland) Act 1980. The entire act was repealed in Ireland by the Statute Law Revision Act 1983.\n\n\n\n"}

He was originally styled the Earl of Enzie until his succession as Marquess in December 1653, when he was around four years old. The young Marquess was educated at a Catholic seminary in France, following a tradition within the Huntly family. In 1673, when he was aged 24, he entered the French Army of Louis XIV and served under the famous Marshal de Turenne before returning to Scotland sometime around 1675.\n\nIn October of the following year, 1676, he married Lady Elizabeth Howard, the second daughter of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk. However, he was described by the historian Macky as someone \"made for the company of ladies, but is covetous which extremely eclipses him.\" The marriage was not wholly successful and the couple parted some years before his death.\n\nOn 1 November 1684, George was advanced from Marquess of Huntly, becoming the first Duke of Gordon. Following the accession of the Catholic James II in 1685, the Duke was made one of the Commissioners of Supply, Constable of Edinburgh Castle, a Commissioner of the Scottish Treasury and a founding Knight of the Order of the Thistle. The Duke owed these positions to his Catholicism, Around this time, he was described as being \"a libertine and a fop, he is a Roman Catholic because he was bred so, but otherwise thinks very little of revealed religion.\"\n\nFollowing the Glorious Revolution and the overthrow of James II, the Duke held Edinburgh Castle against the Protestant Conventionists. However, he is remembered as being \"vacillating in his defence\" and eventually surrendered the Castle on 14 June 1689. As a result of his actions in Edinburgh, he was received somewhat coldly by King James at his residence in exile, the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. On his return to Scotland he was confined on parole. Shortly after this, his Duchess left him and retired to a convent in Flanders. The Duke temporarily regained favour with the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 and was recognised by her as a Knight of the Thistle when she revived the Order on 31 December 1703. However, the Duke, being a true Gordon, could not stay out of trouble for very long. \n\nIn March 1707, he was arrested along with other Jacobite Lords and was confined to Edinburgh Castle for being implicated in the aborted Jacobite invasion. For his long-suffering Duchess, this was the final straw, and she obtained a deed of separation from her husband. The historian Macky, in his book \"Characters\", observed the Duke and said that \"he hath a great many links, but they do not make a complete chain; is certainly a very fine gentleman and understands conversation and the belles lettres; is well bred. He is handsome and taller than the ordinary size; thin, dresses well; but is somewhat finical, resembling the French\". \n\nThe Duke died at Leith, on 7 December 1716. The Duchess returned to Scotland after his death and resided at Abbey Hill in Edinburgh until her own death in July 1732. Like her husband, she was buried in Elgin Cathedral.\n\nThe duke married Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk and with her had two children:\n"}

Shortly after, her younger brother is said to have drowned in a river. Her father became a drug addict, and she was forced to care for her octogenarian grandparents. Despite her attention to their needs they are reported to have completely ignored her. She grew up in the town of Neka, Iran and was described as a \"lively and intelligent girl.\"\n\nAtefeh was arrested after being raped by a 51-year-old man. According to Islamic Sharia law, she was convicted for crimes against chastity. During her alleged torture she admitted to having had sex repeatedly with the 51-year-old ex-revolutionary guard turned taxi-driver Ali Darabi. Darabi was a married man with children at the time. \n\nAtefeh had been raped by Ali Darabi over a period of 3 years without her family being aware. While in prison she was further allegedly tortured and raped by prison guards. She told this to her grandmother who visited her saying that afterwards she could only walk on all fours because of the pain. The judge in her case was Haji Rezai. When Atefah realized that she was losing her case, she removed her hijab, an act seen as a severe contempt of the court, and argued that Ali Darabi should be punished, not her. She even removed her shoes and threw them at the judge. Rezai later sentenced her to death.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the documents presented to the Supreme Court of Appeal described her as 22 years old, but her birth certificate and death certificate stated that she was 16. The issue of her age was not brought to proper attention before it was too late.\n\nAmnesty International and other organisations claimed that she suffered from psychological illness, both before and at the trial.\n\nShe was publicly hanged from a crane in Neka, Iran, on August 15, 2004. The judge in her case, Haji Rezai, allegedly also applied the noose himself. \n\nAmnesty International and other organizations declared her execution to be a crime against humanity and against children of the world.\n\nAfter the execution of Atefeh, Iranian media reported that Judge Rezai and several militia members, including Captain Zabihi and Captain Molai, were arrested by the Intelligence Ministry. The execution is considered controversial because as a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Iran promised not to execute anyone under the age of 18. Atefeh's father had passed her birth certificate to the civil authorities, lawyers involved, journalists and Judge Rezai. Pursuant to continual complaints filed by Atefeh's family, and heavy international pressure about her execution and the way the judge mishandled the case, the Supreme Court of Iran issued an order to pardon Atefeh.\n\nThe case of Atefeh Sahaaleh is the subject of a BBC documentary made by Wild Pictures in 2006. Director, Monica Garnsey and Associate Producer, Arash Sahami went undercover to document the case. It is also the subject of an hour-long Discovery Times program called \"Execution in Iran.\"\n\n\n"}

In 1860, he accompanied his father, Jarvis William Hartt, to St. John, New Brunswick, where they established a high school for young women in which Charles Frederick taught for a year. Hartt also studied the geology of New Brunswick, and devoted special attention to the Devonian shales, in which he discovered an abundance of land plants and insects.\n\nIn 1861, Hartt started to work as a student assistant for Louis Agassiz at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University. This work lasted until 1864, when he received an appointment on the geological survey of New Brunswick. In 1865 he accompanied Agassiz to Brazil in the Thayer Expedition. A creationist, Agassiz believed he could find geological proof of his theory concerning glacial action in Brazil that would knock down the evolutionist theory of Charles Darwin.\n\nHartt fell in love with Brazil, and spent 15 months exploring the coastal regions from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. The large zoological collections he made were later used to prepare his \"Geology and Physical Geography of Brazil\" (Boston, 1870). In 1868 he was elected professor of natural history at Vassar College, but later in the same year he accepted a post at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, and planned to return to Brazil. Charles married Lucy Cornelia Lynde of Buffalo, New York, in 1869. They had two children, Mary and Rollin. Both children became writers.\n\nIn all, Hartt participated in four expeditions to Brazil (the Morgan Expeditions) from 1870 to 1878. He collected a great deal of data about the land and the people, contributing to new knowledge about the flora, the fauna, minerals, geography, linguistics and ethnography. He was an accomplished draftsman and illustrator and musician. In his last voyage he collected more than 500,000 specimens, which were donated to the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, where he worked as the founder and director of the section of geology from 1866 to 1867.\n\nIn 1875, following a suggestion by Hartt, the Emperor Dom Pedro II (1825–1891) established the Imperial Geological Commission. The Commission was closed down after two years of work after losing the Emperor's support. Hartt was joined by his wife and children in Brazil in 1875, but they returned to the United States without him when his wife got pregnant.\n\nHe died in Rio de Janeiro, after contracting yellow fever, at the age of 38.\n\nOne of his students, the American geologist Orville Adalbert Derby (1851–1915), succeeded him at the National Museum, after having accompanied him in two of the Morgan Expeditions (1870 and 1871) and having worked with him at the Imperial Commission.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2296342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296342", "title": "Leland Stottlemeyer", "text": "Leland Stottlemeyer\n\nCaptain Leland Francis Stottlemeyer is a fictional police officer played by Ted Levine on the American crime drama \"Monk\". He is captain of the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)'s homicide detail, and a longtime and long-suffering friend of Adrian Monk from their days on the force together where Stottlemeyer served as Monk's fourth partner and later as watch commander. Stottlemeyer's second-in-command, Lieutenant Randy Disher, is a source of much comedic strife. Stottlemeyer, like many of the characters in the show, can be viewed as a parallel to Detective Monk's Sherlock Holmes character (in this case, Inspector Lestrade).\n\nNot much is known of Stottlemeyer's life before he joined the SFPD, though in an interview, Ted Levine stated it was his own belief that Stottlemeyer had served in the military and was later discharged, lived on the East Coast, then moved to California as a young man, joining the police force. In \"Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion\", it is implied that he has lived in the Bay Area since at least the 1970s, as when he is trying to get information from reunion guests about a homicide investigation, he is booed off the stage when the projectionist displays some embarrassing pictures of him wearing riot gear and violently attacking protesters at an anti-nuclear warfare demonstration at UC Berkeley (Monk and Natalie are mortified, while Stottlemeyer insists that the protestors' permit had expired). In \"Mr. Monk Makes the Playoffs\", it is mentioned that he hasn't lived in Los Angeles for almost 30 years. The novel \"Mr. Monk and the New Lieutenant\" reveals that Stottlemeyer's father was a bartender named Hamish. In \"Mr. Monk Stays in Bed\" Leland uses the phrase \"The 101\" to refer to Highway 101. In Northern California, people will call Highway 101, \"Highway 101,\" not \"The 101\"; that's a Southern California term. Stottlemeyer mentions in \"Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever\" that he was the youngest officer in the history of the SFPD to make detective, giving him at least a few years of seniority on Monk. As Stottlemeyer mentions in \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival,\" when Monk was promoted to detective, he was partnered with Stottlemeyer, and right away, showed off his amazing abilities when he proved that a prostitute's apparent suicide was murder.\n\nSomehow, the two men worked well together, even though Stottlemeyer was later promoted past Monk. At the time Trudy was murdered, Stottlemeyer reluctantly suspended Adrian from duty, though he still remained his friend. Stottlemeyer also looked up Sharona Fleming and hired her as Monk's practical nurse, which helped Monk to recover from a state of near-catatonia caused by the loss of Trudy.\n\nMonk later calls Stottlemeyer \"the best cop I know.\"\n\nIn the early episodes of the show especially, there is a certain degree of tension between Stottlemeyer and Monk. Stottlemeyer is somewhat antagonistic toward Monk, as he resents being forced (frequently by the higher-ups, such as the Mayor, the chiefs, or the commissioner) into calling on Monk's assistance, and is frequently exasperated by Monk's many quirks. Also inherent in this hostility is a certain degree of jealousy; Stottlemeyer appears only too aware that he is not nearly the detective that Monk is. Sometimes, this has led to some rather large consequences. For instance, in the novel \"Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop\", he starts to feel a little hostile towards Monk after taking a lot of ribbing from Paul Braddock (and at one time, Braddock actually insults Stottlemeyer, accusing him of using Monk as a metaphorical crutch). As a result, later in the story, upon learning that Monk's consultancy contract has been ripped up, Sharona takes her anger out on Stottlemeyer, accusing him of using the latest round of budget cuts as an excuse to cut Monk (and her) loose as a result of Braddock attacking his abilities.\n\nAt the same time, Stottlemeyer is also skeptical of Monk's ability to perform as a police officer, aware that Monk's psychological problems are a very serious handicap to such a stressful and dangerous occupation; in \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival\", he is forced to betray Monk by honestly revealing his misgivings about allowing Monk back into the police department to the panel evaluating Monk's request. Sharona calls him on his jealousy by telling Stottlemeyer \"at least your friend Adam Kirk has the decency to stab people in the front,\" and noting that Stottlemeyer owes Monk that much since Monk does all the work and he takes all the credit.\n\nDespite these tensions, however, Stottlemeyer also has a great deal of sympathy and respect for Monk; even Stottlemeyer cannot deny Monk's abilities. Once convinced of the validity of one of Monk's theories, Stottlemeyer always proves a staunch ally in apprehending Monk's primary suspects. A turning point for the character came in the second season episode \"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife\", when Stottlemeyer's own wife Karen is seriously injured in a car accident and put in a coma. Though she recovers, Stottlemeyer is left with a taste of the kind of pain Monk bears from Trudy and becomes far more sympathetic and respectful to him, if still easily exasperated by Monk's more extreme idiosyncrasies.\n\nIn \"Mr. Monk Makes a Friend\", Monk apparently makes a friend out of Hal Tucker, who is revealed later to have just been using him, but Stottlemeyer saves him, identifying Monk as his friend when he stops Hal. Another example of Stottlemeyer's loyalty as a friend comes in \"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\", when he helps in Monk's continuing investigation of Trudy's murder. He goes with Monk to New York City to follow up on a lead, and harshly confronts New York City police captain Walter Cage for concealing information about Warrick Tennyson that is essential to Monk to solving the murder of his \"friend's wife\", remarking that that was the only thing he cared about at the time. In \"Mr. Monk Is On the Run\", when Monk is framed for murder by corrupt sheriff John Rollins, Stottlemeyer proves his loyalty to Monk by helping him fake his own death, risking his own career and freedom.\n\nStottlemeyer begins to come to terms with Monk's quirky behavior after the first few episodes, as demonstrated, for example, in \"Mr. Monk and the Employee of the Month\". In one scene, Stottlemeyer asks Monk if he is going to pop all the bubbles on a piece of bubble wrap. When Monk says yes, Stottlemeyer begins to help him, and also has two police officers assist him. When one of them asks whether there is any reason why they are doing this, Stottlemeyer tells them, \"Nope, just keep popping.\"\n\nIt is mentioned in \"Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine\" that Stottlemeyer was Monk's fourth partner on the force, and this came two weeks after Monk made detective (Monk says that his first three partners were good enough guys but their professional chemistry did not work).\n\nStottlemeyer's relationship with Randy Disher is unbelievable from amused tolerance to frustration. He puts up with his idiosyncrasies and even barely resists laughing at some of his outlandish theories and quirks. It is such that he sometimes prefers to talk to Monk instead of him (such as in \"Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist\", when Randy is complaining about an excruciating toothache). However, he appreciates Randy's abilities and even harbors some affection for him, especially in dangerous situations. He even goes out to help Randy win his money back in \"Mr. Monk Goes to Vegas\". In \"Mr. Monk Gets Lotto Fever\", he offers to pay off Randy's college loans when he thinks he has won the lottery.\n\nStottlemeyer's recurring problems with his romantic relationships are a frequent running gag of the show.\n\nLeland married Karen (Glenne Headly) in 1985. They were married for twenty years. Leland states that they have known each other since their childhood in \"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife\". They have two sons, Jared and Max.\n\nLeland and Karen have recurring marital problems and are known to have separated twice. In \"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage,\" Monk explains to Natalie that the couple have practically nothing in common (case in point: he recalls one weekend when Leland went on a hunting trip, while Karen stayed behind to organize a rally for stronger gun control).\n\nIn the season 2 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Very Very Old Man\", Karen has to beg Leland to investigate the murder of Miles Holling, the world's oldest man (115 years of age). Leland promises to her that he will investigate if Monk believes that there has been foul play in Miles' death. Because Leland never watched her documentary \"Miles Holling: The Human Time Machine\", Karen kicks him out of the house and Leland is forced to temporarily room with Monk. He does eventually watch the film, which gives him a clue needed to solve both this case and a hit-and-run from several years earlier.\n\nIn the season 2 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife\", Karen is badly injured after a sniper lethally shoots a tow truck driver, sending the truck into a head-on collision with Karen's car. Leland is left with the same type of pain that Monk has learned to deal with. His emotions nearly get the better of him twice, first when confronting a labor union boss he believes to be implicated in the shooting, and then when arresting the actual criminal.\n\nIn the season 3 episode \"Mr. Monk Gets Fired\", Karen is seen filming a documentary about life behind-the-scenes in the SFPD, capturing several moments of the new commissioner's anger as well as Leland and Disher arresting Paul Harley for a premeditated murder and an arson.\n\nIn the season 4 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Captain's Marriage,\" when Leland is working on the murder of Jimmy \"Chicklet\" Botsdale, one of the cops on the scene, Sergeant Ryan Sharkey Jr. claims to be having an affair with Karen. Leland punches him and afterwards, he decides to ask Karen if she knows Sharkey. Karen suspiciously denies it, but Leland suspect that it might prove why she's taken to sleeping in the guest room (which she claims is because of his snoring) and her forgetting their anniversary.\n\nBecause Leland is taking an anger management class, he has to ask Monk and Natalie to follow Karen for him. They are able to take a picture of Karen meeting someone, but cannot get a clear photo. At the end of the episode, when Leland shows the picture to Karen, she says she is seeing a divorce lawyer, as she has decided to end their marriage.\n\nIn the season 8 episode \"Mr. Monk Is the Best Man,\" it is mentioned that Karen was Leland's second wife, and he was married once before, but that marriage was annulled after only five days.\n\nIn \"Mr. Monk, Private Eye,\" Stottlemeyer meets and falls for a local city realtor, Linda Fusco (Sharon Lawrence), after Linda hires Monk and Natalie to investigate a fender bender involving her purple 2006 Buick Lucerne. By the end of the episode, Linda even sets up Stottlemeyer with an apartment just across the street from her own.\n\nDespite being acquainted, Stottlemeyer's dates with Linda are usually interrupted or cancelled as a result of his duties. In \"Mr. Monk and His Biggest Fan\", Linda is forced to participate in a bachelor auction and pay $2000 to buy Stottlemeyer for six hours of her time (at the same auction, Monk gets \"bought\" by Marci Maven). However, their date is interrupted when Stottlemeyer realizes that Marci's neighbor John Ringel murdered his wife Debbie and framed Marci's dead dog.\n\nLinda and Stottlemeyer continue dating until the season 6 episode \"Mr. Monk and the Bad Girlfriend\", when Stottlemeyer is planning to propose to her during their shared trip to Hawaii. However, shortly before they leave, Linda's former business partner Sean Corcoran is shot and killed by a shotgun-wielding assailant while showing off a house to a couple. Monk and Natalie take the case, but they are both alarmed when they uncover a large amount of evidence that leads them to suspect Linda is the killer: from a photo of her in her office posing with her late grandfather with a twelve-gauge shotgun, they realize she owns a weapon similar to that used in the murder. They also discover that she has an obvious motive – that Sean was preparing to start his own company and would take a lot of Linda's clients with him – and she is the same height as the killer, has a key to the house, and even wears the same shade of lipstick that a witness described the shooter as wearing. Unfortunately, they have a hard time convincing anyone else, especially Stottlemeyer, that Linda killed her partner.\n\nTo prove Linda guilty, Monk and Natalie carefully set up a sting operation that exposes how Linda created her airtight alibi for the murder (she talked to Stottlemeyer from a duplicate of her bedroom constructed in the back of a box rental truck that she had rented using her maiden name and previous address). Stottlemeyer reluctantly arrests her, and is left to ask himself whether his relationship with Linda was the real deal, or she just conceived it because she needed a cop to be her alibi for the murder, one question that will never be answered. Taking Disher to accompany him to Hawaii, he secretly throws the engagement ring into the ocean. When Randy asks what he did, Stottlemeyer responds, \"That was nothing. That was just a rock,\" which indicates that he planned to propose to Linda while in Hawaii.\n\nIn the final season, Stottlemeyer meets and starts dating journalist Trudy \"T.K.\" Jensen (Virginia Madsen), beginning in the episode \"Happy Birthday, Mr. Monk\". While Stottlemeyer is initially concerned that Trudy's name would upset Monk, Monk is enthused, saying that everyone should have a Trudy in their life. When Sharona sees T.K.'s picture in Stottlemeyer's office in the season 8 episode \"Mr. Monk and Sharona\", she says Stottlemeyer must feel like he won the lottery, and he heartily agrees.\n\nIn the episode \"Mr. Monk Is the Best Man\", Leland marries T.K. However, as the days count down until their wedding, someone starts making threats against Leland and T.K., including ransacking his house, blowing up his car, making threatening phone calls to T.K., and setting off a bomb at the wedding rehearsal. Monk eventually finds out that these acts were the work of T.K.'s friend and maid of honor, Stephanie Briggs (Teri Polo), who was trying to recover a gun she had used earlier that week to kill fellow ecoterrorist Martin Kettering.\n"}

{"id": "2296348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296348", "title": "History of Louisville, Kentucky", "text": "History of Louisville, Kentucky\n\nThe geology of the Ohio River, with a but a single series of rapids halfway in its length from the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers to its union with the Mississippi, made it inevitable that a town would grow on the site. Louisville, Kentucky was chartered in the late 18th century. From its early days on the frontier, it quickly grew to be a major trading and distribution center in the mid 19th century, important industrial city in the early 20th, declined in the mid 20th century, before revitalizing in the late 20th century as a culturally-focused mid-sized American city. \n\nThe history of Louisville, Kentucky spans a bit over two centuries since the latter part of the 18th century. Prior to arrival of Europeans, the region was depopulated from the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, and no permanent Native American settlements existed in the area. It was used as hunting grounds by northern Shawnee and southern Cherokee. The area's geography and location on the Ohio River attracted people from the earliest times. The city is located at the Falls of the Ohio River, then a part of Kentucky County, Virginia. The rapids created a barrier to river travel, and settlements grew up at this portage point. The earliest European settlements were during the latter stages of the American Revolutionary War by Virginian soldiers under George Rogers Clark, first at Corn Island in 1778, then Fort-on-Shore and Fort Nelson on the mainland. The town was chartered in 1780 and named Louisville in honor of King Louis XVI of France. That year it received an influx of 300 settlers.\n\nIn 2003, the city of Louisville merged with Jefferson County to become Louisville-Jefferson Metro. As of the 2010 census, it is the largest city in the state of Kentucky, the second largest on the Ohio River, and 29th largest city in the nation.\n\nNotable residents of the city have included inventor Thomas Edison, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, boxing legend Muhammad Ali, newscaster Diane Sawyer, actors Victor Mature, Ned Beatty and Tom Cruise, actresses Sean Young and Jennifer Lawrence, singer Nicole Scherzinger, R&B singer Bryson Tiller, the Speed family (including U.S. Attorney General James Speed and Abraham Lincoln's close friend Joshua Fry Speed), the , industrialist/politician James Guthrie, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and contemporary writers Hunter S. Thompson and Sue Grafton.\n\nNotable events occurring in the city include the largest exhibition installation to date (in 1883) and first large space lighted by Edison's light bulb, and the first library in the South made accessible to African Americans. Medical advances included the 1999 first human hand transplant in the United States and the first self-contained artificial heart transplant in 2001.\n\nThere was a continuous indigenous human occupation of the area that became Louisville from at least 1,000 BCE until roughly 1650 CE, when the Beaver Wars resulted in depopulation of much of the Ohio River region. The Iroquois maintained this area as a hunting ground by conquest.\n\nArcheologists have identified several late and one early Archaic sites in Jefferson County's wetlands. One of the most extensive finds was at McNeeley Lake Cave; many others were found around what is now the Louisville International Airport area. People of the Adena culture and the Hopewell tradition that followed it lived in the area, with hunting villages along Mill Creek and a large village near what became Zorn Avenue, on bluffs overlooking the Ohio River. Archeologists have found 30 Jefferson County sites associated with the Fort Ancient and Mississippian cultures, which were active from 1,000 AD until about 1650. The Louisville area was on the eastern border of the Mississippian culture, which extended through the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries. Regional chiefdoms built dense villages and cities characterized by extensive earthwork mounds arranged around central plazas.\n\nWhen European and English explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in the mid-18th century, there were no permanent Native American settlements in the region. The country was used as hunting grounds by Shawnee from the north and Cherokee from the south.\n\nThe account of the first European to visit the area, the French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1669, is disputed and not supported by facts. La Salle travelled along the St. Lawrence River to Lake Ontario, then to Lake Erie. The two priests traveling with his party departed the group at that point, and the written documentation of the expedition apparently ceased. Reports of what occurred differ, including abandonment of the journey due to illness, or traveling onward but not to the Ohio River. La Salle did not claim to discover the Ohio River on that voyage nor travel to the falls (of the Ohio). The \"discovery\" of the Louisville area in 1669 is thus perhaps better assigned to myth or legend. Subsequently, La Salle explored areas of the Mississippi river valley and lower Great Lakes region from the Gulf of Mexico up to modern-day Canada, claiming much of this land for France.\n\nIn 1751, the English colonist Christopher Gist explored areas along the Ohio River. Following the defeat of France in the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War in Europe), it ceded control of its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain.\n\nIn 1769, British colonist Daniel Boone created a trail from North Carolina to Tennessee. He spent the next two years exploring Kentucky. In 1773, Captain Thomas Bullitt led the first exploring party into Jefferson County, surveying land on behalf of Virginians who had been awarded land grants for service in the French and Indian War. In 1774, James Harrod began constructing Fort Harrod in Kentucky. However, battles with the Native American tribes established in the area forced these new settlers to retreat. They returned the following year, as Boone built the Wilderness Road and established Fort Boonesborough at a site near Boonesborough, Kentucky. The Native Americans allocated a tract of land between the Ohio River and the Cumberland River for the Transylvania Land Company. In 1776, the colony of Virginia declared the Transylvania Land Company illegal and created the county of Kentucky in Virginia from the land involved.\n\nCol. George Rogers Clark made the first Anglo-American settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville in 1778, during the American Revolutionary War. He was conducting a campaign against the British in areas north of the Ohio River, then called the Illinois Country. Clark organized a group of 150 soldiers, known as the Illinois Regiment, after heavy recruiting in Virginia and Pennsylvania. On May 12, they set out from Redstone, today's Brownsville, Pennsylvania, taking along 80 civilians who hoped to claim fertile farmland and start a new settlement in Kentucky. They arrived at the Falls of the Ohio on May 27. It was a location Clark thought ideal for a communication post. The settlers helped Clark conceal the true reason for his presence in the area.\n\nThe regiment helped the civilians establish a settlement on what came to be called Corn Island, clearing land, and building cabins and a springhouse. On June 24, Clark took his soldiers and left to begin their military campaign. A year later, at the request of Clark, the settlers crossed the river and established the first permanent settlement on the mainland. By April, they called it \"Louisville\", in honor of King Louis XVI of France, whose government and soldiers aided colonists in the Revolutionary War. Today, George Rogers Clark is recognized as the European-American founder of Louisville; many landmarks have been named for him.\n\nDuring its earliest history, the colony of Louisville and the surrounding areas suffered from Indian attacks, as Native Americans tried to push out the encroaching colonists. As the Revolutionary War was still being waged, all early residents lived within forts, as suggested by the earliest government of Kentucky County, Virginia. The initial fort, at the northern tip of today's 12th street, was called Fort-on-Shore. In response to the threat of British attacks, particularly Bird's invasion of Kentucky, a larger fort called Fort Nelson was built north of today's Main Street between Seventh and Eighth streets, covering nearly an acre. The GB￡15,000 contract was given to Richard Chenoweth, with construction beginning in late 1780 and completed by March 1781. The fort, thought to be capable of resisting cannon fire, was considered the strongest in the west after Fort Pitt. Due to decreasing need for strong forts after the Revolutionary War, it was in decline by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 1780, the Virginia General Assembly and then-Governor Thomas Jefferson approved the town charter of Louisville on May 1. Clark recruited early Kentucky pioneer James John Floyd, who was placed on the town's board of trustees and given the authority to plan and lay out the town. Jefferson County, named after Thomas Jefferson, was formed at this time as one of three original Kentucky counties from the old Kentucky County, Virginia. Louisville was the county seat.\n\nAlso, during 1780, three hundred families migrated to the area, the town's first fire department was established, and the first street plan of Louisville was laid out by Willian Pope. Daniel Brodhead opened the first general store here in 1783. He became the first to move out of Louisville's early forts. Jonathan Cessna built the first house in newly platted Louisville. James John Floyd became the first judge in 1783 but was killed later that year. The first courthouse was completed in 1784 as a 16 by log cabin. By this time, Louisville contained 63 clapboard finished houses, 37 partly finished, 22 uncovered houses, and over 100 log cabins. Shippingport, incorporated in 1785, was a vital part of early Louisville, allowing goods to be transported through the Falls of the Ohio. The first church was built in 1790, the first hotel in 1793, and the first post office in 1795. During the 1780s and early 1790s, the town did not grow as rapidly as Lexington in central Kentucky. Factors were the threat of Indian attacks (ended in 1794 by the Battle of Fallen Timbers), a complicated dispute over land ownership between John Campbell and the town's trustees (resolved in 1785), and Spanish policies restricting American trade and travel down the Mississippi to New Orleans. By 1800, the population of Louisville was 359 compared to Lexington's 1,759.\n\nFrom 1784 through 1792, a series of conventions were held to discuss the separation of Kentucky from Virginia. On June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth state in the United States and Isaac Shelby was named the first Governor.\n\nIn 1803, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson to make an expedition across North America; they organized it at the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville. The Lewis and Clark Expedition would take the explorers across the western U.S., surveying the Louisiana Purchase, and eventually to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSince settlement, all people and cargo had arrived by flatboats and later keelboats, both of which were non-motorized vessels, meaning that it was prohibitively costly to send goods upstream (towards Pittsburgh and other developed areas). This technical limitation, combined with the Spanish decision in 1784 to close the Mississippi River below Vicksburg, Mississippi to American ships, meant there was very little outside market for goods produced early on in Louisville. This improved somewhat with Pinckney's Treaty, which opened the river and made New Orleans a Free trade zone by 1798.\n\nHowever, most cargo was still being sent downstream in the early 19th century, averaging 60,000 tons downstream to 6,500 tons upstream. Boats passing through still had to unload all of their cargo before navigating the falls, a boon to local businesses. The frontier days quickly fading, log houses and forts began to disappear, and Louisville saw its first newspaper, the \"Louisville Gazette\" in 1807 and its first theatre in 1808, and the first dedicated church building in 1809. All of this reflected the 400% growth in population reported by the 1810 Census.\n\nThe economics of shipping were about to change, however, with the arrival of steamboats. The first, the \"New Orleans\" arrived in 1811, traveling downstream from Pittsburgh. Although it made the trip in record time, most believed its use was limited, as they did not believe a steamboat could make it back upriver against the current. However, in 1815, the \"Enterprise\", captained by Henry Miller Shreve, became the first steamboat to travel from New Orleans to Louisville, showing the commercial potential of the steamboat in making upriver travel and shipping practical.\n\nIndustry and manufacturing reached Louisville and surrounding areas, especially Shippingport, at this time. Some steamboats were built in Louisville and many early mills and factories opened. Other towns were developing at the falls: New Albany, Indiana in 1813 and Portland in 1814, each competing with Louisville to become the dominant settlement in the area. Still, Louisville's population grew rapidly, tripling from 1810 to 1820. By 1830, it would surpass Lexington to become the state's largest city, and would eventually annex Portland and Shippingport.\n\nIn 1816 the Louisville Library Company, the city's first library, opened its doors with a subscription-based service. Also, in a series of events ranging from 1798 to 1846, the University of Louisville was founded from the Jefferson Seminary, Louisville Medical Institute and Louisville Collegiate Institute.\n\nIn response to great demand, the Louisville and Portland Canal was completed in 1830. This allowed boats to circumvent the Falls of the Ohio and travel through from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. In response to several epidemics and the increasing need to treat ill or injured river workers, Louisville Marine Hospital was completed in 1825 on Chestnut Street, an area that is today home to Louisville's Medical Center.\n\nIn 1828, the population surpassed 7,000 and Louisville became Kentucky's first city. John Bucklin was elected the first Mayor. The nearby towns of Shippingport and Portland remained independent of Louisville for the time being. City status gave Louisville some judicial authority and the ability to collect more taxes, which allowed for the establishment of the state's first public school in 1829.\n\nIn 1831, Catherine Spalding moved from Bardstown to Louisville and established Presentation Academy, a Catholic school for girls. She also established the St. Vincent Orphanage, which was later renamed as St. Joseph Orphanage.\n\nLouisville's famous Galt House hotel—the first of three downtown buildings to have that moniker—was erected in 1834. In 1839, a precursor to the modern Kentucky Derby was held at Old Louisville's Oakland Race Course. Over 10,000 spectators attended the two-horse race, in which \"Grey Eagle\" lost to \"Wagner\". This race occurred 36 years before the first Kentucky Derby. It was a popular competition to test the quality of horses. Louisville became a center for sales of horses and other livestock from the Bluegrass Region of central Kentucky, where horse breeding became a major part of the economy and traditions.\n\nThe Kentucky School for the Blind was founded in 1839, the third-oldest school for the blind in the country. In 1847, William H. Gibson opened one of the city's first schools for African Americans in the basement of the Methodist church on Fourth and Green Streets.\n\nIn 1840 William Burke Belknap the elder (1811–1884) started the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company on the banks of the Ohio River.\n\nIn 1848, Zachary Taylor, resident of Jefferson County from childhood through early adulthood and a hero of the Mexican–American War, was elected as the 12th President of the United States. He served only sixteen months in office before dying in 1850 from acute gastroenteritis. He was buried in the east end of Louisville at Zachary Taylor National Cemetery.\n\nFollowing the 1850 Census, Louisville was reported as the nation's tenth largest city, while Kentucky was reported as the eighth most populous state.\n\nThe Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N) Company was founded in 1850 by James Guthrie, who also was involved in the founding of the University of Louisville. When the railroad was completed in 1859, Louisville's strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio became central to the city's development and importance in the rail and water freight transportation business.\n\nOn August 6, 1855, a day dubbed Bloody Monday, election riots stemming from the bitter rivalry between the Democrats and supporters of the Know-Nothing Party broke out. Know-Nothing mobs rioted in Irish and German parts of the city, destroying property by fires and killing numerous people.\n\nFounded in 1858, the American Printing House for the Blind is the oldest organization of its kind in the United States. Since 1879 it has been the official supplier of educational materials for blind students in the U.S. It is located on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton neighborhood, adjacent to the campus where the Kentucky School for the Blind moved in 1855.\n\nLouisville had one of the largest slave trades in the United States before the Civil War, and much of the city's initial growth is attributed to that trade. Shifting agricultural needs produced an excess of slaves in Kentucky, and many were sold from here and other parts of the Upper South to the Deep South. In 1820, the slave population was at its height at nearly 26% of the Kentucky population, but by 1860, that proportion had dropped significantly, even though this percentage still represented over 10,000 people. Through the 1850s, slave traders sold 2500–4000 slaves annually from Kentucky down river.\n\nThe expression \"sold down the river\" originated as a lament of eastern slaves being split apart from their families in sales to Louisville. Slave traders collected slaves there until they had enough to ship in a group via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers down to the slave market in New Orleans. There slaves were sold again to owners of cotton and sugar cane plantations.\n\nLouisville was the turning point for many enslaved blacks. If they could get from there across the Ohio River, called the \"River Jordan\" by escaping slaves, they had a chance for freedom in Indiana and other northern states. They had to evade capture by bounty-seeking slave catchers, but many were aided by the Underground Railroad to get further north for freedom.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Louisville was a major stronghold of Union forces, which kept Kentucky firmly in the Union. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the Western Theater. While the state of Kentucky officially declared its neutrality early in the war, prominent Louisville attorney James Speed, brother of President Abraham Lincoln's close friend Joshua Fry Speed, strongly advocated keeping the state in the Union. Seeing Louisville's strategic importance in the freight industry, General William Tecumseh Sherman formed an army base in the city in the event that the Confederacy advanced.\n\nIn September 1862, Confederate General Braxton Bragg decided to take Louisville, but changed his mind. There was lack of backup from General Edmund Kirby Smith's forces. In addition, the decision to install Confederate Governor Richard Hawes in the alternative government in Frankfort made people think the state might change. In the summer of 1863, Confederate cavalry under John Hunt Morgan invaded Kentucky from Tennessee and briefly threatened Louisville, before swinging around the city into Indiana during Morgan's Raid. In March 1864, Generals Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant met at the Galt House to plan the spring campaign, which included the capture of Atlanta, Georgia. (, that this meeting actually occurred has fallen into dispute.)\n\nBy the end of the war, Louisville itself had not been attacked once, although it was surrounded by skirmishes and battles, including the Battle of Perryville and the Battle of Corydon. The Unionists—most of whose leaders owned slaves—felt betrayed by the abolitionist position of the Republican Party. After 1865 returning Confederate veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe that it joined the Confederacy after the war was over.\n\nDuring the postwar years, the Freedmen's Bureau opened a school, led by W. H. Gibson, and a bank in the city to serve the now free and growing African American population. Confederate women organized in associations to ensure the dead were buried in cemeteries, to identify missing men, and to build memorials to the war and their losses. By the 1890s, the memorial movement came under the control of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and United Confederate Veterans (UCV), who promoted the \"Lost Cause\". Making meaning after the war was another way of writing its history. In 1895, in one of their successes, a Confederate monument was erected near the University of Louisville campus.\n\nJames Callahan and other area businessmen organized the Louisville, Harrods Creek and Westport Railway in 1870 and continued construction through the Long Depression before failing in 1879. Although the LHC&W never reached beyond Harrods Creek, its service was continued by the L&N and contributed to growth in the city's eastern suburbs, particularly after the LRC purchased and electrified the track between Zorn Avenue and Prospect in 1904.\n\nThe first Kentucky Derby was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club track (later renamed to Churchill Downs). The Derby was originally shepherded by Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr., the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city's founder George Rogers Clark. Ten thousand spectators were present at the first Derby to watch Aristides win the race.\n\nOn February 2, 1876, professional baseball launched the National League, and the Louisville Grays were a charter member. While the Grays were a relatively short-lived team, playing for only two years, they began a much longer lasting relationship between the city and baseball. In 1883, John \"Bud\" Hillerich made his first baseball bat from white ash in his father's wood shop. The first bat was produced for Pete \"The Gladiator\" Browning of the Louisville Eclipse (minor league team). The bats eventually become known by the popular name, \"Louisville Slugger\", and the local company Hillerich & Bradsby rapidly became one of the largest manufacturers of baseball bats and other sporting equipment in the world. Today, Hillerich & Bradsby manufactures over one million wooden bats per year, accounting for about two of three wooden bats sold worldwide.\n\nIn 1877 the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary relocated to Louisville from Greenville, South Carolina, where it had been founded in 1859. Its new campus, at Fourth and Broadway downtown, was underwritten by a group of Louisville business leaders, including the Norton family, eager to add the promising graduate-professional school to the city's resources. It grew quickly, attracting students from all parts of the nation, and by the early 20th century it was the second largest accredited seminary in the United States. It relocated to its present campus on Lexington Road in 1926.\n\nIn February 1882, Oscar Wilde lectured in the city and on that occasion met Emma Speed Keats, the niece of his poetical hero (John Keats), who had settled in the city. She was the daughter of Keats' brother George Keats and she later sent Wilde an autograph manuscript by Keats of his poem 'Sonnet on Blue'.\n\nOn August 1, 1883, U.S. President Chester A. Arthur opened the first annual Southern Exposition, a series of World's Fairs that would run for five consecutive years adjacent to Central Park in what is now Old Louisville. Highlighted at the show was the largest to-date installation of incandescent light bulbs, having been recently invented by Thomas Edison, a former resident.\n\nDowntown Louisville began a modernization period in the 1890s, with Louisville's second skyscraper, the Columbia Building, opening on January 1, 1890. The following year, famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted was commissioned to design Louisville's system of parks (most notably, Cherokee, Iroquois and Shawnee Parks) connected by tree-lined parkways. Passenger train service arrived in the city on September 7, 1891, with the completion of the Union Station train hub. The first train arrived at 7:30 am. Louisville's Union Station was then recognized as the largest train station in the South.\n\nInterrupting these developments, on March 27, 1890, a major tornado measuring F4 on the Fujita scale visited Louisville. The \"whirling tiger of the air\" carved a path from the Parkland neighborhood all the way to Crescent Hill, destroying 766 buildings ($2½ million worth of property) and killing an estimated 74 to 120 people. At least 55 of those deaths occurred when the Falls City Hall collapsed. This is one of the highest death tolls due to a single building collapse from a tornado in U.S. history.\n\nIn 1893, two Louisville sisters, Patty and Mildred J. Hill, both schoolteachers, wrote the song \"Good Morning to All\" for their kindergarten class. The song did not become popular, and the lyrics were later changed to the more recognizable, \"Happy Birthday to You\". This is now the most performed song in the English language.\n\nAlso in 1893, the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary was founded, building a handsome campus at First and Broadway downtown (now occupied by Jefferson Community College). Eight years later, it absorbed an older Presbyterian seminary in Danville, Kentucky. In 1963 Louisville Seminary relocated to a modern campus on Alta Vista Road near Cherokee Park.\n\nIn the early 20th century, controversy over political corruption came to a head in the 1905 Mayor election, called the most corrupt in city history. An anti-corruption party unique to Louisville, called themselves the Fusionists, briefly emerged at this time. Democratic boss John Whallen succeeded in getting his candidate, Paul C. Barth, elected, but the results were overturned in 1907. Elections gradually became less corrupt, but political machines would still hold considerable power for decades.\n\nThe Waverly Hills Sanatorium was opened in 1910 to house tuberculosis patients. The hospital was closed in 1961. It was later used as a retirement home (1963–1982). It was unused for more than a decade until 1991, when it was reopened for tours.\n\nDuring World War I, Louisville became home to Camp Taylor. In 1917, the English-bred colt \"Omar Khayyam\" became the first foreign-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. Two years later, in 1919, Sir Barton became the first horse to win the Triple Crown, though the term for the three prime races did not come into use for another 11 years.\n\nIn 1920, Louisville's first zoo was founded at Senning's Park (present-day Colonial Gardens), next to Iroquois Park. Barely surviving through the Great Depression, it closed in 1939. Its successor, the current Louisville Zoo, did not open until 1969.\n\nIn 1923, the Brown Hotel's chef Fred K. Schmidt introduced the Hot Brown sandwich in the hotel restaurant, consisting of an open-faced \"sandwich\" of turkey and bacon smothered with cheese and tomato. The Hot Brown became rather popular among locals and visitors alike, and can be ordered by many local restaurants in the area today.\n\nThe Belle of Louisville, today recognized as the oldest river steamboat in operation, came to Louisville in 1931. That same year, the Louisville Municipal College for Negroes was established to allow black Louisvillians to attend classes. (The college was dissolved into the University of Louisville with the ending of segregation in 1951.)\n\nOn March 28, 1936, the river reached a level of 60.6 feet, flooding parts of the city. In late January and February 1937, a month of heavy rain throughout the Ohio River Valley prompted what became remembered as the \"Great Flood of '37\". The flood submerged about 70 percent of the city and forced the evacuation of 175,000 residents. In Louisville, 90 people died. At the crest on January 27, 1937, the waters reached above flood level in Louisville. Photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White documented the flood and its aftermath in a series of famous photos. Later, flood walls were installed to prevent another such disaster.\n\nStandiford Field was built in Louisville by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1941. Bowman Field, a smaller airport, had been previously opened in 1919.\n\nLouisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the Curtiss-Wright Aircraft Company a war plant located at Louisville's air field for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the C-46 Commando cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946 the factory was sold to International Harvester, which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. Otter Creek Park was given to Louisville by the U.S. Government in 1947, in recognition of the city's service during World War II.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the arts flourished in Louisville. The Speed Art Museum was opened in 1927 and is now the oldest and largest museum of art in Kentucky. The Louisville Orchestra was founded in 1937. In 1949 the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival was begun, and today it is the oldest free and independently-operating Shakespeare festival in the United States. The Kentucky Opera was started in 1952, and the Louisville Ballet was founded that same year, though it only achieved professional status in 1975. In 1956 the Kentucky Derby Festival was started to celebrate the annual Kentucky Derby. The next year, in 1957, the St. James Court Art Show was started. Both these are still popular festivals in the region.\n\nEight whiskey distilleries opened on 7th Street Road after the end of prohibition, and Louisville attempted to annex them to increase its tax base. Not wanting to pay city taxes, the whiskey companies persuaded the Kentucky General Assembly to pass the Shively Bill, which made it much more difficult for Louisville to annex additional areas. The distilleries used Kentucky's existing laws (which favored the mostly rural communities in the state) to form a ½ square-mile city named Shively in 1938. Shively grew to include residential areas.\n\nIn 1946 the General Assembly passed a law allowing the formation of a Metropolitan Sewer District, and Louisville's Board of Aldermen approved its creation a few months later. With the expansion of sewer service outside of traditional city limits and laws hindering Louisville's annexation attempts, areas outside of the city limits that were developed during the building boom after World War II became cities in their own right. This status prevented their annexation by Louisville. As a result, Louisville's population figures leveled off. The incorporation of such several new communities contributed to the defeat of Louisville's attempt to merge with Jefferson County in 1956. Louisville continued fighting to annex land to grow.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, Louisville began to decline as an important city in the 1960s and 1970s. Highways built in the late 1950s facilitated movement by the expanding middle class to newer housing being developed in the suburbs. With the loss in population, the downtown area began to decline economically. Many formerly popular buildings became vacant. Even the previously strong Brown Hotel closed its doors in 1971 (although it later reopened). Fontaine Ferry Park, Louisville's most popular amusement park during the early 20th century, closed in 1969 as people's tastes for entertainment changed.\n\nThe once-strong farmer's market, Haymarket, ceased operations in 1962 after 71 years of operation. The final death-knell for the Haymarket, already in decline due to changing economic trends, was the construction of an Interstate 65 ramp through the main part of the open-air market. Not only did interstates facilitate suburban living, they sliced through older city neighborhoods and often divided them irreversibly.\n\nAnother major (F4) tornado hit on April 3, 1974, as part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states. It covered and destroyed several hundred homes in the Louisville area but was only responsible for 2 deaths. It also caused extensive damage in Cherokee Park.\n\nDespite these signs of decline, a number of activities were taking place that presaged the Louisville Renaissance of the 1980s.\n\nSoutheast Christian Church, today one of the largest megachurches in the U.S., was founded in 1962 with only 53 members. In 1964, Actors Theatre of Louisville was founded. It was later designated the \"State Theater of Kentucky\" in 1974. It has created a strong regional theater.\n\nIn 1973, the racehorse Secretariat made the fastest time ever run in the Derby (at its present distance) at 1 minute 59⅖ seconds. Excitement over him raised interest in the Derby.\n\nThere were signs of revival in the 1970s. Throughout the decade, new buildings came under construction downtown, and many historic buildings were renovated. Louisville's public transportation, Transit Authority of River City, began operating a bus line in 1974. And in 1981 the Falls of the Ohio was granted status as a Federal conservation area.\n\nOn the downside, in the early morning hours of February 13, 1981, sewer explosions ripped through the southern part of Old Louisville and near the University of Louisville. The cause was traced back to chemical releases into the sewer system from a nearby Ralston-Purina soybean processing facility.\n\nLouisville continued to struggle during the 1980s in its attempt to redevelop and expand. It fought with other Jefferson County communities in two more failed attempts to merge with county government in 1982 and 1983. Barry Bingham, Jr. sold the family business Standard Gravure in 1986, which sent the company into a major restructuring in the following years. \"The Courier-Journal\" was one of the papers printed by Standard Gravure. On September 14, 1989, Joseph Wesbecker, on medical leave due to mental illness and work-related stress, entered the Courier-Journal building and shot and killed eight employees, injuring another twelve before killing himself.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Louisville was affected, as it had maintained a segregated society. Civil rights groups had undertaken a variety of actions to challenge that. In addition, black neighborhoods had declined during the economic downturn of the city. Urban renewal efforts undertaken for ostensible improvements had adversely affected the center of their neighborhood.\n\nAfter national civil rights legislation had passed in 1964 and 1965, energy continued among African Americans to push for social changes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had for years had an office in the Parkland neighborhood, which had an African-American majority population. In Louisville, as in other cities, there was a political struggle between the NAACP and more militant activists associated with Black Power. The latter's attempt to organize people was one of the catalysts for the riot. In addition, feelings were raw because Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated less than two months before. On May 27, 1968, a group of 400 mostly African-Americans gathered for a protest in Parkland. They opposed possible reinstatement of a white officer involved in an incident where physical conflict had occurred in the arrest of two African-American men. The group was organized by the Black Unity League of Kentucky, known as BULK. BULK had announced that activist Stokely Carmichael was to come to Louisville to speak, but he had no such plans. When the crowd gathered, speakers spread rumors that Carmichael's plane had been purposely delayed; protesters got angry, and a disturbance began.\n\nThe crowd's tossing bottles and looting forced the police to retreat. By midnight, rioters had looted several stores in Downtown Louisville. Cars were overturned and some burned. Mayor Kenneth A. Schmied ordered the 2,178 Kentucky National Guardsmen to help disperse the crowd. The mayor also issued a citywide curfew. 472 arrests were made during the riots, two African-American teenage boys were killed, and over $200,000 in property damage was done. The National Guard remained in place until June 4, 1968. Following these events, the city's demographics changed dramatically; the city became more racially segregated by neighborhoods, and more middle-class people, of both races, moved to newer housing in the suburbs.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" in 1954, Louisville's public schools were still essentially segregated, especially as regional residential segregation had become more pronounced due to other economic changes. In 1971 and 1972 the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union, Legal Aid Society, and NAACP filed suit in federal court to desegregate the Louisville and Jefferson County school systems. The Kentucky Commission on Human Rights also filed suit asking that desegregation be achieved through merger of the Louisville, Jefferson County and Anchorage school systems, to overcome residential segregation and the inability of the city to expand by annexation and take in a more diverse area. By February 28, 1975, the state Board of Education ordered the merger of the Louisville and Jefferson County schools systems effective April 1, 1975.\n\nOn July 17, 1975, Judge James F. Gordon stipulated that a desegregation plan would be implemented at the beginning of the 1975–76 school year, to begin September 4, 1975. The school system used mandatory busing to distribute students to integrate the newly merged school systems. The students were bused according to the first initial of their last name and their grade level. The busing was to achieve certain percentages of racial diversity in schools regardless of where the students lived. In practical effects, the plan required black students to be bused up to 10 of their 12 years in school, and white students 2 of their 12 years. In 1978 the judge ended his supervision of the project, but the decree remained in effect in some places. The school system continued the busing system. In the mid-1980s, the school system restructured the plan to try to provide for more local schooling for students. Guidelines remained in effect for percentages of the student population based on ethnicity.\n\nSince the 1980s, Louisville has had a revival in popularity and prosperity. This can be seen in the many changes in this period, including a great deal of downtown infrastructure.\n\nThe retail environment changed here and across the country. Woolworth went out of business in 1990. The building in Louisville, designed by architect Frederick W. Garber and completed in 1946, was demolished in 2004. The site was not redeveloped at the time, but paved for a parking lot.\n\nMany cultural showcases were founded or expanded in this period. The Kentucky Center for the Arts was officially dedicated in 1983. In 1984 the center hosted one of the U.S. presidential election debates between candidates Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. Today the Center hosts many touring plays and performances by the Kentucky Opera and the Louisville Ballet. An IMAX theater was added to the Kentucky Science Center in 1988. Phase I of the Louisville Waterfront Park was completed in 1999, and Phase II was completed in 2004. Though originally built as a standard movie theater in 1921, the Kentucky Theater was reopened in 2000 as a performing arts venue.\n\nIn 1988, the Louisville Falls Fountain, the tallest computerized fountain in the world, began operation on the Ohio River at Louisville. Its high spray (later reduced to due to energy costs) and fleur-de-lis patterns graced Louisville's waterfront until the fountain was shut down in 1998.\n\nThe headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the largest Presbyterian denomination and a pillar of the religious \"main line,\" moved to Louisville in 1988. The move was the result of a concerted campaign, led by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary president John Mulder, Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson, and with a gift of waterfront buildings from Humana founder David Jones.\n\nIn communications, \"The Courier-Journal\", Louisville's primary local newspaper, was purchased in 1987 by media giant Gannett. The \"Louisville Eccentric Observer\" (LEO), a popular alternative newspaper, was founded in 1990. \"Velocity\" was later released by the \"Courier-Journal\" to compete with the \"LEO\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2003, the city of Louisville and Jefferson County merged into a single government named \"Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government\". This merger made Louisville the 16th or 27th most populous city in the U.S., depending on how the population is calculated. The change enabled consolidation of some services and activities to provide better government for the region.\n\nNew changes and growth continued in the city. The entertainment and retail district called Fourth Street Live! was opened in 2004, and the Muhammad Ali Center was opened in 2005. Between the 1990 Census and 2000 Census, Louisville's metro area population outgrew that of Lexington by 149,415, and Cincinnati's by 23,278.\n\nSince 1884, The Filson Historical Society (originally named the Filson Club), with its extensive collections, has led the way in preserving Louisville's history, and publishes articles in its quarterly journal. The University of Louisville and the Louisville Free Public Library have also maintained extensive historical collections.\n\nAs of 2016, Louisville does not have a museum dedicated to the city's history. Various museums and historic homes present exhibits that interpret this history. These include the Filson, Portland Museum, Historic Locust Grove, Falls of the Ohio State Park interpretive center (Clarksville, Indiana), Howard Steamboat Museum (Jeffersonville, Indiana), Carnegie Center for Art & History (New Albany, Indiana), and the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History (Frankfort).\n\n\n\n\n "}

{"id": "2296353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296353", "title": "Birbhum district", "text": "Birbhum district\n\nBirbhum district () is an administrative unit in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the northernmost district of Burdwan division—one of the five administrative divisions of West Bengal. The district headquarters is in Suri. Other important cities are Rampurhat, Bolpur and Sainthia. Jamtara, Dumka and Pakur districts of the state of Jharkhand lie at the western border of this district; the border in other directions is covered by the districts of Bardhaman and Murshidabad of West Bengal.\n\nOften called \"the land of red soil\", Birbhum is noted for its topography and its cultural heritage which is somewhat different from the other districts in West Bengal. The western part of Birbhum is a bushy region, a part of the Chhota Nagpur Plateau. This region gradually merges with the fertile alluvial farmlands in the east.\n\nThis district saw many cultural and religious movements in history. The Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan, established by Rabindranath Tagore, is one of the places Birbhum is known for. Many festivals are celebrated in the district, including Poush Mela.\n\nBirbhum is primarily an agricultural district with around 75% of the population being dependent on agriculture. Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk harvesting and weaving, rice and oilseed milling, lac harvesting, stone mining and metalware and pottery manufacture. Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station is the only heavy industry in the district.\n\nThe name Birbhum comes probably from the term 'land' ('bhumi') of the 'brave' ('bir'). Another theory says that the district bears the name of Bagdi king Bir Malla, who ruled in the area from 1501 to 1554 CE. \"Bir\" in the Santali language means forests; therefore, Birbhum could also mean a land of forests.\n\nSituated between 23° 32' 30\" (right above the tropic of cancer) and 24° 35' 0\" north latitude and 87° 5' 25\" and 88° 1' 40\" east longitudes, and about in area, this district is triangular. River Ajay forms the southern base and the apex of the triangle points north. The river forms the boundary between the districts of Birbhum and Bardhaman. The state of Jharkhand is at the northern and the western border of Birbhum and Murshidabad is at the east.\n\nGeographically, this area lies at the northeastern end of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, as it slopes down and merges with the alluvial plains of the Ganges. In the district there is only hilly area of natural rock formation situated near Dubrajpur town called Mama Bhagne \"Pahar\" (Hill). The western portion of the district is historically known as \"Vajjabhumi\" or \"Bajrabhumi\". It is an undulating upland that is generally barren. The comparatively more fertile eastern portion, constituting the northeastern Rarh region, merges with the Gangetic plain. \"Vajjabhumi\" is included in the Rarh region, and the rest of Rarh is called \"Sumha\" to differentiate it from \"Vajjabhumi\".\n\nThe climate on the western side is dry and extreme but is relatively milder on the eastern side. During summer, the temperature can shoot well above and in winters it can drop to around . Rainfall is higher in the western areas as compared to the eastern areas. The annual average rainfall in Rajnagar is and in Nanoor it is , mostly in the monsoon months (June to October).\n\nClimate and rainfall chart of Birbhum District \nSeveral rivers flow across Birbhum. Some of these are Ajay, Mayurakshi (Mor), Kopai, Shal, Bakreshwar, Brahmani, Dwarka, Hinglo, Chapala, Bansloi, Pagla, Chandravaga etc. A project on the Mayurakshi that includes the Tilpara Barrage (near Suri), provides irrigation for about . Almost all the rivers originate higher up on the Chota Nagpur plateau and flow across Birbhum in a west–east direction. These rivers are furious during the monsoons but shrink during the dry summer months. The cyclical rotation of drought and floods of the rivers destroy lives and property, and adds to the difficulties of life in the district.\n\nThe area now known as Birbhum was inhabited from pre-historic times. Some of the archaeological sites related to Pandu Rajar Dhibi of chalcolithic remains are located in Birbhum. Stone age implements have been found at several places in the district.\n\nAccording to the old Jain book \"Acaranga Sutra\", the last (24th) great Tirthankara Mahavira had wandered through this land, referred to as the \"pathless country of Ladha in \"Vajjabhumi\" and \"Subbhabhumi\" (probably Suhma)\" in the 5th century, B.C. According to some historians, the spread of Jainism and Buddhism in the Rarh region was part of the process of Aryanisation of the area. Based on \"Divyabdan\", a Buddhist text, Dr. Atul Sur has inferred that Gautam Buddha probably traversed this area to go to Pundravardhana and Samatata.\n\nThe Rarh region, once a part of the Maurya empire was later included in the empires of the imperial Guptas, Shashanka and Harshavardhana. After dismemberment of Harshavardhana's empire, the region was ruled by the Palas till the 12th century AD, when overlordship of the area passed into the hands of the Senas. During the rule of the Pala dynasty Buddhism, particularly the Vajrayana cult, flourished here. In the 7th century A.D., the Chinese traveller Xuanzang described some of the monasteries he visited.\n\nThe 13th century witnessed the advent of Muslim rule in the region. However, control over the western parts of the district appears to have been nominal, and the area was ruled by the local Hindu chiefs, known as the Bir Rajas (Bagdi Malla dynasty). The three towns of Hetampur, Birsinghpur and Rajnagar contain their relics. Hetampur and Rajnagar Kingdoms ruled most of Birbhum and parts of Burdwan, Maldah and Jharkhand from Dubrajpur (meaning two kingdoms - Hetampur & Rajnagar). Minhaj-i-Siraj, the author of the \"Tabaqat-i-Nasiri\", mentions Lakhnur as the \"thanah\" (headquarters) of the Rarh \"wing\" of the Muslim rule and an important frontier post. The location of Lakhnur, though not yet identified, falls in Birbhum.\n\nMythology has it that the forests of \"Vajjabhumi\" (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities. Some authors have called Birbhum by the name Kamkoti which relates to its tantric heritage. Tantrics, including the Vajrayana, the Shaktas, and the Buddhists established many temples for tantra sadhana rituals and Shakti worship. Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati. One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was Bamdev, popularly known as Bama Khyapa.\n\nDuring the time of British East India Company, the administrative unit by the name Birbhum was formed in 1787. Before that, it was administratively a part of Murshidabad district. In 1787, when the official \"District Beerbhoom\" was established, the district was much bigger than it is now. Till 1793, it included \"Bishenpore\" or Bishnupur, which is now part of the Bankura district. Till the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, the Santhal Parganas was part of Birbhum; the district thus sprawled up to Deoghar in the west. The immediate reason then for separating the western tribal majority areas was the Santhal rebellion of 1855–56, which was quelled. Sidhu and Kanu are remembered in Birbhum as martyrs of this uprising.\n\nBirbhum is primarily an agricultural district with around 75% of the people dependent on agriculture. While of land is occupied by forests, of land is used for agricultural purposes. 91.02% of the population live in villages. Out of total 4,50,313 farmers(holding 3,20,610 hectares of land), 3,59,404 are marginal farmers(holding 1,41,813 hectares altogether), 63,374 are small farmers(holding 95,144 hectares altogether), 26,236 are semi-medium farmers(holding 76,998 hectares altogether), 1,290 are medium farmers(holding 6,215 hectare altogether), and 9 are large farmers (holding 440 hectares of land). The average size of land holding per farmer is 0.71 hectares. 6,07,172 people work as agricultural labourers in Birbhum. Major crops produced in the district include rice, legumes, wheat, corn (maize), potatoes and sugar cane. The district has thirteen cold storages. Land with irrigation facilities in 2001-02 totalled . There are five barrages, providing irrigation support. Canada Dam on the Mayurakshi river at Massanjore lies close to the border of Birbhum and the Dumka district in Jharkhand. Further down the Mayurakshi is the Tilpara Barrage at Suri.\n\nBirbhum is a major centre of cottage industries. Perhaps the most notable cottage industry is a non-profit rural organisation named Amar Kutir. Other main industries in Birbhum are agriculture-based industries, textiles, forestry, arts and crafts. Sriniketan is noted for its dairy industry and as a forestry centre. Some of the notable forms of cottage industries of Birbhum include textile—especially cotton and locally harvested tussar silk, jute works, batik, kantha stitch, macramé (weaving by knotting threads), leather, pottery and terracotta, solapith, woodcarving, bamboo and cane craft, metal works and tribal crafts. There are 8,883 small and medium scale industries. Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk harvesting and weaving, rice and oilseed milling, lac harvesting, and metalware and pottery manufacture. Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station (210 MW x 3 + 210 MW x 2 under construction) is the only heavy industry in the district.\n\nSainthia is known as business capital of Birbhum and an economically important city. Sainthia is the major centre for export and import of cottage industries. Huge numbers of businesses run in this city and its economy stands tall due to sales of agricultural based products.\n\nIn 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Birbhum one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the eleven districts in West Bengal currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).\n\nThe district comprises three subdivisions: Suri Sadar, Bolpur and Rampurhat. Suri is the district headquarters. There are 26 police stations, 19 development blocks, 8 municipalities and 167 gram panchayats in this district. Other than municipality area, each subdivision contains community development blocs which in turn are divided into rural areas and census towns. There are seven urban units: six municipalities and one census town. The latest amongst the urban units to have a municipality was Nalhati in 2000.\n\nBefore delimitation the district was divided into 12 assembly constituencies (AC):Nanoor (AC #283), Bolpur (AC #284), Labhpur (AC #285), Dubrajpur (AC #286), Rajnagar (AC #287), Suri (AC #288), Mahammad Bazar (AC #289), Mayureswar (AC #290), Rampurhat (AC #291), Hansan (AC #292), Nalhati (AC #293) and Murarai (AC #294). The constituencies of Nanoor, Rajnagar, Mayureswar and Hansan were reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) candidates.Vidhan Sabha was elected in 2006 assembly elections, which took place before the rearrangement of parliamentary and assembly constituencies as per order of the Delimitation Commission in respect of the delimitation of constituencies in the West Bengal. Delimitation was made effective for all elections in the state of West Bengal that was held on or after 19 February 2008. 2009 Indian general election was based on the newly formed parliamentary constituencies and the newly formed assembly constituencies have representatives in the 2011 elections of West Bengal.\n\nAs per order of the Delimitation Commission in respect of the delimitation of constituencies in the West Bengal, the district is divided into 11 assembly constituencies: Dubrajpur (AC #284), Suri (AC #285), Bolpur (AC #286), Nanoor (AC #287), Labpur (AC #288), Sainthia (AC #289), Mayureswar (AC #290), Rampurhat (AC #291), Hansan (AC #292), Nalhati (AC #293) and Murarai (AC #294). Dubrajpur, Nanoor and Sainthia constituencies are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) candidates.\n\nDubrajpur, Suri, Sainthia, Rampurhat, Hansan, Nalhati and Murarai assembly segments form the Birbhum (Lok Sabha constituency). Bolpur, Nanoor, Labhpur, and Sainthia constituencies are part of Bolpur (Lok Sabha constituency), which will contain three other assembly segments from Bardhaman district.\n\nThe Panagarh–Morgram Highway runs through the district. All the towns and villages are connected by roads. The total length of roads in the district are: surfaced– and unsurfaced–. Against this the total length of rail track in the district is , including of the Ahmadpur-Katwa line, laid in 1917. The Sahibganj Loop of the Eastern Railway, laid in 1862, passes through this district. There is a junction at Nalhati for the connection to Azimganj in Murshidabad district. The Andal-Sainthia Branch Line connects it to the main Howrah-Delhi main line at Andal.\n\nIn 1901, Birbhum had a population of 902,280, which by 1981 rose to 2,095,829. According to the 2001 census data, the total population has further risen to 3,015,422. The following table summarises the population distribution:\nAccording to 2011 Indian Census, Hindus form around 62% of the total population with Muslims about 37%. Others, including religious groups and non-religion population fall below 1% of the population.\n\nHindus form around 65% of the population according to 2001 census. Muslims are about 33% of the population. There is a sprinkling of other religious groups in the population. According to the 2001 census, 29.5% of the population belong to the scheduled castes and 6.7% to the scheduled tribes. Other than those speaking the local dialect of Bengali, there are tribal Santhals and ten other tribal communities in Birbhum with some presence, amongst whom Koda, Mahali and Oraons are more common.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Birbhum district has a population of 3,502,387, roughly equal to the nation of Lithuania or the US state of Connecticut. This gives it a ranking of 84th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 16.15%. Birbhum has a sex ratio of 956 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 70.9%.\n\nThe bauls of Birbhum, their philosophy and their songs form a notable representation of the folk culture of the district. Birbhum has been home to \"kabiyal\"s, \"kirtaniya\"s and other folk culture groups.\n\nThe numerous fairs in Birbhum start with \"Poush Mela\" at Santiniketan and follows through the Bengali month of Poush till Makar Sankranti. Particularly lively is the fair at Jaydev Kenduli. Festivities are organised across the seasons. People of Birbhum patronise folk entertainment programmes such as jatra, kavigan and alkap.\n\nMany poets were born in this district, as for example, Chandidas (Rami). In addition to being a confluence of Vaishnava, Shakta and Saiva cultures, Birbhum villages observe prehistoric customs like worship of gramdevta (\"gram\" means village and \"devta\" means deity) in many forms.\n\nAmongst the major attractions of Birbhum are Bakreshwar, Tarapith, Dwarbasini temple at Chondrapur and Patharchapuri. Birbhum has many old temples, such as the ones at Jaydev Kenduli, Surul and Nanoor, with delicate decorative tiles made of terra cotta (burnt clay).\n\nMany famous people lived and worked in Birbhum, specially at Santiniketan. Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen is one of them. Rabindranath Tagore made this district his home and established his great centre of learning, Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan. Jaydev Kenduli, which until recently was believed to be the birthplace of the 12th century Sanskrit poet Jayadeva, is on the bank of the river Ajay.\n\nNanoor is the birthplace of the 14th-century poet Chandidas Rami. Nityananda Swami (Nitai of the famous Nitai-Gaur pair) the co–founder of Vaishnav religion with Shri Chityanyadev was born at Ekachakra. Tarashankar Bandopadhyay (1898–1971), one of the leading Bengali literary figures in recent times and who wrote extensively about life in Birbhum, belongs to Labhpur.\nJustice Sattar, a former president of Bangladesh and a former chief election commissioner of Pakistan, was born in Birbhum district in 1906.\nBangladeshi scientist who was also president of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences, Muhammad Qudrat-i-Khuda, was born in Birbhum district in 1900.\nThe eastern area of Birbhum is a part of the rice plains of West Bengal, and the vegetation includes usual characteristics of rice fields in Bengal, such as species of Aponogeton, Utricularia, Drosera, Philcoxia, Scrophulariaceae and similar aquatic or palustrine genera. In the drier western region of the district, the characteristic shrubs and herbs include species of Wendlandia, Convolvulaceae, Stipa, Tragus, Spermacoce, Ziziphus, Capparis and similar plants that grows on laterite soil. Mango, palm, and bamboo are among common trees in Birbhum. Other common species of plants are jackfruit, arjun, sal, guava, kend and mahua.\n\nOther than feral dogs and domestic cattle, the most frequently encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey langur prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears are not to be seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.\n\nBallabhpur Wildlife Sanctuary near Santiniketan was declared a sanctuary in 1977.

In 1951 census, the literacy rate was 17.74%. It increased to 48.56% in 1991.\n\nThe growth of literacy in the last decade of the twentieth century was particularly remarkable with special emphasis on the eradication of illiteracy. While it is feared that Birbhum may not be able to fulfill the national objective of sending all children in the age group 6–14 years to school by 2010, efforts are on in that direction.\n\nThe district has 127 libraries supported by the government, one private library and one district library.\n\nOne of the most popular outdoor sports in the villages of Birbhum used to be danguli (literal meaning \"ball and stick\"). However, in recent times cricket has replaced some of its popularity. A sport that can be played outdoors and indoors and is popular among children is marbles, which involves projecting a striker bead with fingers to hit an ensemble of black or green glass beads.\n\nIn addition to cricket, the other most popular outdoor sports of this district are football and kabadi and volleyball.\n\nDanguli and Marble used to be seen 50 years ago.\n\nThe main outdoor sports are Football and Cricket played everywhere in Birbhum, although there is a tennis court in Siuri, it is not played commonly.\n\nFlying kites, swimming and karate are also common.\n\n"}

Mai oder Konrad reitet in die Südsee\" in German, its original language) is a novel by Erich Kästner, first published in 1931. Unlike most of Kästner's other works - set in a completely realistic contemporary Germany - the present book is a work of fantasy and satire.\n\nIn his preface to the 1928 \"Emil and the Detectives\" Kästner recounts that he intended to write a humorous South Sea adventure story, but got stuck with the concrete details and finally followed the advice of a friend to write instead a book set in the familiar Berlin reality. Several of the plot details and characters briefly mentioned where Kästner describes his aborted fantasy were taken up in \"35th of May\", written four years later.\n\nThe novel is about Conrad, a young boy, who spends each Thursday afternoon with his uncle, Mr. Ringelhuth. One Thursday — it happens to be the 35th of May — they meet Negro Caballo, a black horse that can speak, is well-versed in German literature, and at the same time, is the best roller skater in the world. Together they enter Mr. Ringelhuth's huge wardrobe, which stands in the hallway, and end up in a series of magical lands, starting with the land of Cockaigne (\"free entry — children half price\"), followed by a mediaeval castle complete with jousting, an upside-down world in which children send bad parents to reform school, a science fiction nightmare city with mobile phones and moving walkways, and a South Sea island. On his return to the real world, Conrad writes a school essay about his experiences.\n\nThe plot device of a magic wardrobe through which the characters enter magical lands anticipates the similar device used by C. S. Lewis in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", and, earlier, in the 1912 short story by E. Nesbit, \"The Aunt and Amabel\" — in which a girl enters a magic world through a wardrobe.

Quito\n\nLiga Deportiva Universitaria (), often referred to as Liga de Quito, LDU, is an Ecuadorian professional football club based in Quito. They play in the Serie A, the highest level of the Ecuadorian professional football league. They play their home games at the Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado, more commonly referred to as \"Casa Blanca\". Rival clubs include Quito-based clubs El Nacional, Deportivo Quito, Aucas and Universidad Católica.\n\nLiga Deportiva Universitaria has its roots in the semi-pro sports teams in 1918 competing as \"Universitario\" at the Central University of Ecuador, and was officially founded on January 11 of 1930. They began making an impact in the provincial leagues, winning nine Pichincha titles (six in the professional era). Their provincial success continued into the national league, where they have won 11 national title (4th overall) having won their most recent title in 2018. They are the most successful Ecuadorian club in international competitions, where they were the first Ecuadorian club to win the Copa Libertadores (2008), the Copa Sudamericana (2009), and the Recopa Sudamericana (2009 and 2010). They are one of only six teams —Boca Juniors, Independiente, River Plate, Internacional and São Paulo being the other five— to have achieved the CONMEBOL treble, winning all three continental club tournaments. LDU is the only team to win all three mentioned cups one after another between the years 2008 to 2010 causing them to be rated as the best South American team of 2008 and 2009. Liga de Quito was additionally the runner-up at the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nLiga de Quito's roots lie in a semi-pro sports team based out of the Central University of Ecuador on October 23 of 1918, headed by Dr. César Jácome Moscoso. Under the leadership of Dr. Bolívar León, the club was officially founded on January 11, 1930. In the early days, Liga participated in a variety of disciplines, including soccer, basketball, athletics, boxing, baseball, swimming, ping-pong, and chess. The club's initial budget was about 500 sucres. The first team's players were students from the university, and had to pay for their own uniforms, medicines, and expenses. Dr. León designed the first uniform, placing its crest, a white \"U\" on an inverted red and blue triangle, on a white shirt, honoring the team's beginnings at the university. Amongst Liga's first players were Carlos Andrade Marín, Oswaldo Mosquera, Alfonso Cevallos, Alfonso Troya and \"\"El Mono\"\" Icaza.\n\nIn 1932, Liga won their first football title at an amateur Pichincha tournament; there was no national amateur league at the time. Five teams participated: Liga, Gladiador, Gimnástico, Atlético, and Cleveland. Liga won all their games, and in the final match, played at the Estadio El Ejido, defeated Gladiador by a score of 4–0. Playing for Liga were Jorge Zapater, Eduardo Flores, Alfonso Cevallos, César González, Jorge Vallarino, Jorge Naranjo, Bolívar \"Ñato\" León, Alejandro Dávalos, Humberto Yáñez, Humberto Freire, and Ernesto Guevara, with Bolívar León as coach. Liga would also win amateur titles in 1952 and 1953, before the league turned professional the following year.\n\nBy 1955, the amateur football association in Pichincha had evolved into the \"Asociación de Fútbol No Amateur de Pichincha\" (), which subsequently organized a professional league for their member clubs from Quito and Ambato. The inaugural \"Campeonato Professional Interandino\" () was held in 1954. Liga won the league's first title, under the management of Lucho Vásquez. The club finished as the runner-up in 1955 and 1956, before winning again in 1958 under Argentine Roberto Ortega. The club won four titles during the 1960s, in 1960, 1961, 1966, and 1967, and finished as runner-up in 1962, 1963, and 1964. Liga had the most successful run of any professional Interandino-era club, accumulating a total of 6 regional titles.\n\nIn 1957 and from 1960 onwards, winning the Interandino title qualified a team to participate in a tournament which crowned a national champion of Ecuadorian professional football. Liga first participated in 1960, after winning the Interandino cup that year. The team's three subsequent Interandino victories did not lead to a national title; the club's best performance was a third-place finish in 1964.\n\nForeign players became integral to the squad during the 1960s. International players included Paulista José Gomes Nogueira in 1960, Chilean Román Soto in 1961, and Paraguayan José María Ocampo in 1966.\n\nIn 1967, all regional tournaments were discontinued in favor of a single national tournament. Liga won its first national championship in 1969, one year after joining the new league, under the leadership of Brazilian José Gomes Nogueira. Liga's ranks at the time included Francisco \"\"El Tano\"\" Bertocchi, Jorge Tapia, Armando \"\"Tito\"\" Larrea, Carlos Ríos, Santiago Alé, Enrique Portilla, and Ramiro Tobar. Liga's victory granted the club its first Copa Libertadores participation in 1970, where it reached the second phase of the tournament, with \"'\"El Tano\"\" Bertocchi tying for the title of top goalscorer of the tournament.\n\nLiga's success was short-lived; in 1972, the club finished seventh of the eight teams participating in the Serie A. At the time, only four teams from the province of Pichincha could play in the top flight. As the worst-performing Pichincha team, Liga took part in a playoff match against the best-performing Pichincha team in Serie B, Universidad Católica, for a berth in the next season's Serie A tournament. Liga lost the match, relegating it to Serie B for the 1973 season, at the end of which the club faced a second relegation, down to the \"Segunda Categoria\" of Ecuadorian football. The club was able to gain promotion back to the Serie B in time for the 1974 season. After winning the first stage of the 1974 Serie B, Liga returned to the Serie A after two years in the lower flights. Liga's rise continued as the team won their second national title after defeating El Nacional. The success was followed by another title win in 1975, marking Liga's first back-to-back national championships. Liga's 1975 and 1976 Copa Libertadores participations saw the squad twice reach the semi-finals of the continental tournament. Key to Liga's success were players Polo Carrera, Oscar Zubía, Jorge Tapia, Gustavo Tapia, Walter Maesso, Juan Carlos Gómez, Ramiro Tobar, Juan José Pérez, and Roberto Sussman, along with Colombian coach Leonel Montoya. Liga would round out the decade with a runners-up finish in 1977, allowing for another Copa Libertadores participation in 1978.\n\nIn contrast to the team's good performances after coming back from relegation, the 1980s were a dismal decade for the club. Liga's best performance during that period was a runners-up finish in 1981, and a subsequent Copa Libertadores participation in 1982. Player Paulo Cesar was the top Serie A goalscorer in 1981.\n\nIn the two decades since 1990, Liga enjoyed a period of domestic success. They started the 1990s with a national title, edging established powerhouse Barcelona. Before the end of the decade, Liga won two more national titles in 1998 and 1999. The 1998 title was won the year Liga inaugurated their new stadium, \"La Casa Blanca\", and ended with an impressive 7–0 win over Emelec.\n\nIn 2000, the club experienced a period of crisis. This crisis resulted in a poor performance in the national league and Liga was relegated to the Serie B that season. The club managed to bounce back from relegation and won the Serie B in 2001 to gain promotion back to the Serie A. Two years later in 2003, Liga won their 7th national title. Liga added another three more national titles in 2005 Apertura, 2007, 2010 and the most recent in 2018 to bring their current count to eleven, placing them fourth all-time domestically.\n\nPrior to 2008, Liga had participated in sixteen international/continental tournaments. Their best success in South American football at the beginning of 2008 was reaching the semi-finals of the 1975 Copa Libertadores, the 1976 Copa Libertadores, and the 2004 Copa Sudamericana.\n\nOn July 2, 2008, Liga became the first-ever Ecuadorian team to win the Copa Libertadores, after defeating Fluminense by 3–1 in a penalty shootout, after being level after extra time. Liga's Libertadores title gained the club an automatic berth in the semi-finals of the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup, becoming the first non-Argentine or Brazilian CONMEBOL squad to participate in the tournament. Liga defeated Pachuca by 2–0 in their semi-final match, advancing to the final against 2007-08 UEFA Champions League winners Manchester United. Liga lost the final, which was played on December 21 at Yokohama, Japan, by a score of 1–0.\n\nIn June 2009, Liga, as the 2008 Copa Libertadores champion, participated in the 2009 Recopa Sudamericana against the 2008 Copa Sudamericana champion Internacional of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Liga won the first leg, played at Beira Rio stadium in Porto Alegre, by a score of 1–0, with a goal from Claudio Bieler. In the second leg, played at \"La Casa Blanca\", Liga won 3–0 with goals from Carlos Espínola, Claudio Bieler, and Enrique Vera. The 2009 Recopa title was Liga's second international title, as well as being the second international title ever achieved by any Ecuadorian club.\n\nSoon after the Recopa victory, Liga earned their third international trophy in their history, the 2009 Copa Sudamericana. In a rematch of the 2008 Copa Libertadores Final, Liga edged Fluminense with a better goal difference over two legs by winning impressively at home 5–1 and losing 3–0 in Rio de Janeiro. On their way to the finals, they disposed of important clubs from all over South America, such as Libertad of Paraguay, Argentine clubs Lanús and Vélez Sarsfield, and Uruguayan club River Plate.\n\nWith the Copa Sudamericana title, Liga is one of three teams to have won CONMEBOL's treble. Liga achieved this feat in exactly 17 months, less than the other clubs to have done that. Additionally, they qualified to play in the 2010 Recopa Sudamericana against Argentine club Estudiantes de La Plata. They won the first leg 2–1 with both goals coming from Hernán Barcos. The win at home in the first leg was enough to secure the title after both team drew the second leg 0–0. Liga became the third team to win back-to-back Recopa Sudamericanas.\n\nLiga also reached the 2011 Copa Sudamericana Finals, which they lost to Universidad de Chile by a global score of 4–0.\n\nLiga has used four stadiums for their home stadium. Their first stadium was , on the grounds of the Universidad Central del Ecuador. In 1932, Liga moved to Estadio El Ejido, where a number of other teams in Quito used as a home ground. In 1962, Liga moved to Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa, along with a number of other teams from the city. They would use that stadium as a home ground until 1996.\n\nIn 1997, LDU inaugurated their own stadium, Estadio Casa Blanca, in the northern part of the city. It is the largest stadium in Quito in terms of capacity, and the second largest in Ecuador after the Estadio Monumental Banco Pichincha in Guayaquil. The stadium officially opened on March 6, 1997 in a match against Brazilian club Atlético Mineiro. Liga won the match 3–1.\n\nSince its inauguration, the Casa Blanca has been home to Liga's greatest period of success and is often unbeatable at the stadium. They have had six victory laps (\"vueltas olimpicas\") in the stadium since it was inaugurated for five national titles and one international title (two national title and three international titles were sealed elsewhere in the same time period). Barcelona, Ecuador's most popular and successful team nationally, has never defeated Liga in their new stadium.\n\nLDU Quito is one of the most supported clubs in Ecuador. According to a recent study, Liga has the largest fanbase in Quito.\n\nLDU Quito has formed a number of footballing rivalries throughout its history. Their longest-standing rivalry is with Aucas, a southern Quito club founded in 1945, making the two clubs the oldest in the city still in existence. Liga-Aucas matches are referred to as \"El Superclásico de Quito\" (), and the rivalry traces its history back to the first match on February 1, 1945, which ended in a 1–1 tie. A second match, played on February 18, 1945, ended in a 2–2 draw. At the end of the 90 minutes, the game was 2–1; the timekeeper ended the match, but the referee did not notice, allowing the game to continue into extra time, where Aucas equalized the score.\n\nDue to the little importance that the Superclásico de Quito has at present, this party has started to position itself as the most important of the capital Ecuadorian. Liga de Quito and El Nacional star in the team match Quito with more national titles, 11 for Liga de Quito and 13 for El Nacional. The first match was in 1964 which ended with an El Nacional 1–0 victory. Both teams played the finals of 1974 and 1999 by national championship, resulting Liga de Quito champion both times.\n\nIn the absence of intense rivalry with Aucas, Liga and its fans developed a strong rivalry with Deportivo Quito. The \"Clásico Capitalino\" () was the most important game in Quito and was considered a \"must win\" game of the season. In 2008 and 2009, the match had national championship implications that exacerbated the rivalry to a greater degree.\n\nLDU has had six players become the season top-scorer in the Serie A, five players become the top-scorer in the \"Campeaonato Profesional Interandino\", three players as the top-scorer in the Copa Libertadores, one player become the top-scorer in the Copa Sudamericana, and one player become the top-scorer in the Copa CONMEBOL. The team's all-time top scorer is José Vicente Moreno, with 84 goals.\nSerie A\n\nInterandino\n\nCopa Libertadores\nCopa Sudamericana\nCopa CONMEBOL\nThe following players were chosen to represent their country at the FIFA World Cup while contracted to LDU Quito.\n\nThe following managers won at least one trophy when in charge of LDU Quito, in addition to the first manager:\n\nLDU is one of the most successful clubs in the history of Ecuadorian football, with nine regional titles, eleven national titles, and four international titles. Liga won three amateur titles in the Interandino amateur era, tying them for third overall with Gimnástico. In the Interandino's professional era, Liga won six titles, which makes them the most successful team. Nationally, the club has won 11 national titles, the last one in 2018. Their national title count places them fourth overall behind Barcelona with 15 titles, Emelec with 14 titles and El Nacional 13 titles. Liga is the Ecuadorian club who have won more international titles, with four of them.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2296380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296380", "title": "Ernesto Acher", "text": "Ernesto Acher\n\nErnesto Acher (Buenos Aires, October 9, 1939) is an Argentine comedian, actor, composer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist and orchestral conductor. Between 1971 and 1986 he was a member of the celebrated Argentine group Les Luthiers, with which he acted as composer, comedian, singer, and performer on more than twenty instruments, some of which he created himself. Before separating from the group, he was involved in individual projects as composer – including a soundtrack, a quartet for clarinet and strings, a string sextet and a symphonic poem for viola and orchestra. In 1988 he founded the La Banda Elástica (The Elastic Band), gathering some of the most outstanding Argentine jazz musicians. The band dissolved in 1993. Since then he has developed several musical and comedy projects, and performed as an orchestral conductor.\n\nHe is Jewish.\n\nAs a child, he studied piano and, in his teens, as he became interested in jazz, the clarinet. In 1965 he graduated as an architect from the University of Buenos Aires's Architecture and Urbanism School, where he worked also as a teacher on special-structures design. In parallel, he continued his musical studies with Professor Erwin Leuchter. In January 1971 he put architecture aside and devoted himself to music. During the following years he resumed musical studies with José Maranzano, and quite later he took up orchestral conducting with Carlos Calleja.\n\nIn March 1971 he became a member of Les Luthiers, replacing Marcos Mundstock as presenter as well as performer on several both formal and informal instruments. As a composer, his first work for the group was a jazz piece for informal instruments: \"Tristezas del Manuela\" \"(Manuela´s Blues)\". Upon Mundstock`s return in 1972, Acher was asked to stay as actor, composer, arranger and multi-instrumentist. He was the motor behind the group´s collective format, and in the use of amplification with a view to the new, larger venues in which they were eventually to play. Through his friend Alfredo Radoszynski, who at the time headed the legendary Trova recording label, Acher promoted the group´s recording activity as a means to reach larger audiences. Some of his works are: a cycle of jazz pieces with single-vowel titles (a joint idea with Carlos Núñez Cortés), \"Miss Lilly Higgins\", \"Bob Gordon\", \"Papa Garland\", \"Pepper Clemens\" and \"Truthful Lulu\"; his folk pieces \"La yegua mía\", \"Añoralgias\" and \"Epopeya de los quince jinetes\"; \"Teresa y el Oso\" \"(Theresa and the Bear)\", a symphonic poem for narrator and the informal-instruments ensemble, parodying Prokofiev´s Peter and the Wolf, and transcribed in 1976 for narrator, informal instruments and symphonic orchestra; \"Quartet Op. 44\" for five players, and the \"Cantata de Don Rodrigo\", in cooperation with Jorge Maronna and Carlos López Puccio. His most celebrated main roles are that of Don Rodrigo in the \"Cantata\", the king in \"El rey enamorado\" \"(The lovesick king)\", and the “little brat” in \"La gallina dijo Eureka\" \"(Eureka, said the hen)\". The instruments designed and built by Acher include the “valve gom-horn”, the “gom-horn da testa” and the “kalephone”. He also collaborated with Núñez Cortés in the “glamocot” (which can be heard inTheresa and the Bear) and the “clamaneus”, which has never been introduced, and with Carlos Iraldi in designing Antenor, the musical robot in the 1979 show Muchas gracias de nada (Much ado with nothing at all). On top of his talents as composer, arranger and his remarkable ability at different instruments, such as clarinet, bass clarinet, French horn, trombone, piano, accordion, drums and other percussion instruments, plus half a dozen of assorted informal instruments, he was quite expert in approaching different genres and styles. \nBesides his activity with Les Luthiers, he composed the soundtrack for Carlos Jerusalinsky´s medium-length film \"Caja de sorpresas\" \"(Jack-in-the-box)\", based on a short story by Ray Bradbury, which received several awards at the 1976 Uncipar Festival, and had his \"String Sextet\" performed at the 1978 Contemporary Music Festival at Santiago, Chile, as well as \"Molloy\", a symphonic poem for viola and orchestra, with soloist Marcela Magín and the Buenos Aires Philharmonic under maestro Pedro I. Calderón, in 1980.\nAfter his extensive stint with Les Luthiers, he quit the group for reasons that have remained unclear. Acher´s diplomatic explanation is that “Les Luthiers is a multiple marriage, and gentlemen do not ask spouses what went on in their marriage.”\n\nIn early 1988 Acher brought together some of the best Argentine jazz musicians in La Banda Elástica (The Elastic Band). Its members included Carlos Costantini (trumpet, flugelhorn, keyboards, bass, vocals, composing and arrangements), Hugo Pierre (alto & soprano saxophone, clarinet), Enrique Varela (tenor & soprano sax, clarinet, vocals); Ernesto Acher (trombone, baritone sax, clarinet, bass clarinet, French horn, piano, vocals, composing and arrangements), Jorge Navarro (piano, keyboards, percussion, vibraphone, vocals), Ricardo Lew (guitars, bass, percussion, composition and arrangements); Juan Amaral (bass, guitar, vocals), Enrique Roizner (drums, percussion). The group´s idea was to approach all genres, from jazz to Argentine folk songs, with both physical and musical humour, and a certain jazzy flavour, which led famous trombone player (and chef) Christian Kellens to assert that \"What you do is like a ministry, ´cause you do jazz all the time, and people enjoy it without perhaps realizing\". Another important feature is that the players´ multiple abilities enabled them to approach nearly any given genre from different instrument combinations. Their first performance, in June 1988, at the Cervantes Theatre, Buenos Aires, was widely acclaimed by audience and critics alike. It was followed by greatly successful seasons in Buenos Aires (Blanca Podestá, Lorange, and del Globo Theatres), and Mar del Plata (Las Estrellas and Colón Theatres), Then came three recordings and a chockfull of awards, plus performances in other Argentine cities, Montevideo (Uruguay), São Paulo (Brazil), and Asunción (Paraguay). In 1991 Acher conceived and organised a show called \"Together in concert\", with The Elastic Band and Camerata Bariloche, Argentina´s most celebrated chamber ensemble. It was a resounding success at the Opera Theatre and Luna Park. The group disbanded in 1993.\n\nLater in 1993, Acher performed for the first time as a stand-up comedian in \"Humor, con Acher\" \"(Humour with Acher)\"; he also presented his radio programme \"Los rincones de Acher\" \"(Acher´s corners)\" over FM Del Plata, later over Radio Clásica, FM Palermo, and a few years after that over Radio Universidad de Concepción (Concepción, Chile) and Radio Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile). Also that year he performed the first version of his \"Veladas espeluznantes\" \"(Creepy soirées)\", combining repertoire works with musical jokes, conducting the Rosario Symphony Orchestra, Argentina, with the participation his friends Daniel Schapiro and Carlos Núñez Cortés for the occasion. New versions were performed in Córdoba, Mendoza, Rosario, Bahía Blanca (Argentina) and Concepción, Santiago and Antofagasta (Chile). In 1995 Acher founded the \"Offside Chamber Orchestra\", a miniature (23 member) symphonic ensemble specialising in a variegated repertoire, from musical jokes to regular symphonic pieces in reduced arrangements. He participated in countless private events and during a season at the then reopened Lassalle Theatre, Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1997, together with his friends, and most celebrated jazz pianists, Jorge Navarro and Rubén “Baby” López Furst, he presented \"Gershwin, el hombre que amamos\" \"(Gershwin, the man we love)\", with arrangemens by himself and López Furst; the show combined the piano duo of Navarro-López Furst with a symphony orchestra, pairing the highest symphonic jazz standards. After two initial presentations at the Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires in early October, the show stayed on through the end of November, to be repeated the following years in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Santa Fe and Mar del Plata (Argentina) and São Paulo (Brazil). It ended abruptly in July 2000 with López Furst´s death, which precluded an eventual performance in Los Angeles (USA) with the American Jazz Philharmonic. In 1998 Polygram issued a live recording of the 1997 concert, whilst in September 2010 an album was released including a DVD of that concert plus a CD recording of the first (1986) concert by the Navarro-López Furst duo.\n\nIn 1999, after some chamber music projects, Acher, as arranger and conductor, along with his friend Jorge de la Vega (solo flutist of the Colon Theatre Orchestra) as soloist, presented \"Los animales de la música\" \"(Music animals)\" with a forty-member orchestra. The constant pranks between the twain in a humorous and subtle musical context were found highly amusing by both children and grown-ups. Following a successful stint at the Avenida Theatre, the show was again performed at the San Martin Theatre. In 2005, after a short interval, the show made a dashing comeback to the Colon Theatre with more than twenty sold-out performances, and was repeated in Córdoba and Bahía Blanca (Argentina), Asunción (Paraguay) and still is going on. \nA revised version of the Gershwin project was presented with Jorge Navarro trio and orchestra during the 2006 Easter at the Wine Festival in Mendoza, Argentina. The success led to further performances at the Colon, Coliseum and Opera Theatres in Buenos Aires, the San Martin Theatre in Tucuman, and the Campana Jazz Festival in Buenos Aires province. \nAfter having lived for a little over a year in Córdoba, Acher moved to Chile, initially to Concepción, later to Santiago and since 2013 he resides in Linares, 300 km south of Santiago. While in Concepción, he accomplished new projects such as \"Tribute to Piazzolla\", for chamber orchestra, first performed by members of the University of Concepción Symphony Orchestra, and in later years by the Chamber Orchestra of Chile and the School of Modern Music Chamber Orchestra. In 2003 he premiered his \"Fantasy in Concert\", combining five sequences from Disney´s film and live music, and in 2004 his \"The Orchestra Goes to School\", a symphonic/didactic concert, both with the University of Concepción Symphony Orchestra. Before leaving for Santiago, he presented \"Acher en serio?\" \"(Acher… seriously?)\", conducting a chamber ensemble with works by Jobim, Schreker, Piazzolla and Richard Strauss.\nIn 2006, Acher started a fruitful collaboration with Alejandro García \"Virulo\", a Cuban humourist with a long career behind him. With Virulo and two well-known Venezuelan humourists, Emilio Lovera and Laureano Márquez, Acher toured the \"Humour quartet on a single string\" in Mexico, Venezuela and Spain, besides a single performance in Havana, Cuba. In December 2009, Acher and Virulo presented in Havana their \"Symphonic pranks\", combining musical jokes and orchestrated versions of Virulo´s songs. \nSince 2006 Acher has been professor of subjects related to art and literature at the Diego Portales University in Santiago, Chile, whilst continuing with his musical and humour activity.\n\nIn November 2011 he presented in Buenos Aires his \"Tribute to Piazzolla\", recorded and issued by Acqua Records. After a short period as Artistic Director of the Linares Town Hall in 2013, he was appointed as Resident Conductor of the 'Orquesta Clásica del Maule', post which he held until December 2014.\nAfter returning in 2014 with his \"Symphonic pranks\" in Havanna and \"Gershwin, the man we love\" several times in Buenos Aires, he is planning to continue abroad these two projects in 2015 and 2016.\n\n\n"}

It was released as the record's second single on 14 November 1994, and was distributed by Deconstruction and Mushroom as a CD single, cassette tape and 12\" vinyl. The track was written, arranged, and produced by Jimmy Harry, and was recorded in New York City with the parent album's engineer Doug Deangelis. A ballad that discusses themes of ending a relationship and moving on, the song's sound incorporates musical elements of trip hop and pop music.\n\nUpon its release, \"Put Yourself in My Place\" received positive reviews from music critics, with the majority of them complimenting the song's composition and production, whilst highlighting Minogue's vocal performance. While many reviews cited it as one of her best single releases in her career, it won the Best Video award at the 1995 ARIA Music Awards. Commercially, the single charted moderately in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, peaking inside the top 20 in all three regions. Additionally, it was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 35,000 units.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Kier McFarlane, with its plot being inspired by 1968 film \"Barbarella\"; it featured Minogue impersonating the titular character in a spaceship while getting undressed. The song has been performed on Minogue's concert tours including Intimate and Live, On a Night Like This, and Kylie Presents: Golden.\n\n\"Put Yourself in My Place\" was written, arranged, and produced by American musician and songwriter Jimmy Harry. The track was recorded at Whorga Musica Studios, Axis Studios and Power Station Studios in New York City by Doug Deangelis, who served as the engineer and mixer for Minogue's fifth and eponymous studio album (1994); it was the only entry from the parent album that was recorded away from Minogue's home in the United Kingdom. British author Sean Smith, who had written an biography detailing Minogue's career, noted that \"Put Yourself in My Place\" was one of the singer's most personal yet favourite tracks. Musically, it is a ballad-inspired recording that incorporates musical elements of trip hop and pop music, as described by writers Adrian Denning and Hunter Felt from \"PopMatters\". Chris True of AllMusic described the song as \"slicker, more stylish, and less hooky than anything she had previously recorded.\" According to the demo sheet music at Sheet Music Direct published by Music Sales Group, the song is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 78 beats per minute. During the opening sequence and first verse, it has a chord progression of F♭-F-F♭-F-F♭-F-F♭-F-F/A-F♭-F, and Minogue's vocals span from B♭3 to E♭5. Julie Aspinall stated that the lyrical content is \"about a woman who has never been able to get over her ex-boyfriend\".\n\n\"Put Yourself in My Place\" was released as the album's second single on 14 November 1994, and distributed by Deconstruction and Mushroom as a CD single, cassette tape and 12\" vinyl. Two CD sets were made available in the United Kingdom and Australia; the first CD featured the radio mix of the single, two remixes, and one remix of Minogue's previous single \"Confide in Me\" (1994), whilst the second CD replaced the latter track with a remix to her follow-up single \"Where Is The Feeling?\" (1995). Two different CD formats were distributed in Germany and Japan; the former included two remixes of the song, and a remix of \"Confide in Me\", whilst the latter included two remixes of the single on a Mini CD. Two vinyl sets were published in the United Kingdom; one featured four remixes of \"Put Yourself in My Place\", whilst the second vinyl included the same track list as the latter, plus a remix for both \"Confide in Me\" and \"Where Is The Feeling?\". A cassette tape issued in that same territory featured the radio mix and one remix on both sides. The cover art for the two CD sets were photographs by British Rankin, and featured Minogue with headphones. According to the singer's friend William Baker, the shots of Minogue represented a \"serious\" approach to her music.\n\n\"Put Yourself in My Place\" received positive reviews from music critics. Jason Shawahn, writing for About.com, labelled the track as a \"good\" addition to her greatest hits compilation \"Ultimate Kylie\" (2004). British author and music critic Adrian Denning enjoyed the track, and felt it was one of the parent album's \"finest\" songs. He commented that \"'Put Yourself In My Place' is sensual, slow and sports a delicious Kylie vocal full of maturity and actual power.\" \"PopMatters\" Quentin Harrison published a detailed analysis of \"Kylie Minogue\", and noted that \"Put Yourself in My Place\" and her previous single \"Confide in Me\" showcased some of her best vocals. Harrison believed that the single, alongside \"Confide in Me\", represented Minogue's Deconstruction period the most. Similarly, Nick Levine from Digital Spy labelled the track a \"classic\". Marc Andrews from \"DNA Magazine\" also believed it was one of the better highlights on the album, and complimented its ballad-inspired production. Jude Rogers from \"The Guardian\" listed the track on her \"10 of the Best Kylie Minogue Songs\" list in June 2016 alongside complimenting the production and confessing, \"The second single from \"Kylie Minogue\" saw its maker mastering the pop ballad.\" Writing for the \"Herald Sun\", Cameron Adams ranked it at number 16 on his list of the singer's best songs, in honor of her 50th birthday, and called it \"not only a vocal showcase, but just a damn fine tune\".\n\nCommercially, the single charted moderately in Australia, Scotland, and the United Kingdom, peaking inside the top 20 in all three regions. It debuted at number 17 on the Australian Singles Chart, the third highest debut of the week. During its fifth week, it peaked at number 11, and eventually spent 11 weeks in the top 50 chart, marking it one of Minogue's longest-charting single at the time. \"Put Yourself in My Place\" was certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for physical shipments of 35,000 units in that region. It had a similar chart run on the UK Singles Chart, debuting at number 17 and peaking at number 11. It spent four weeks inside the top 20, and remained a nine editions inside the chart as one of the singer's longest-spanning recordings in that territory. The single debuted at number 23 on the Scottish Singles Chart, and peaked at number 14 the following week. In Germany, it debuted at number 98 during the week ending 6 February 1995, and later peaked at number 87 in its second week alongside staying for four non-consecutive weeks in the chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Kier McFarlane, and its plot was inspired by 1968 film \"Barbarella\". According to Minogue, she had been a \"massive\" fan of the film, and wanted to pay tribute to the film's lead actress Jane Fonda, who played the titular character. The video was shot in two days, where Kylie Minogue had been stripped with harnesses and wires; the majority of the shooting included wires pulling off her clothes during those particular sequences. The singer commented in her 2002 book \"\" that it was one of her \"most painful shoots\", and complained that she felt \"rigged\" into all sorts of \"contraptions\". Minogue further complained about the 19 hours spent on both filming days, and revealed she cried during some of the shooting; she jokingly concluded in the book that she would never do another visual that required harnesses and water. Minogue's characteristics in the video were loosely inspired by the titular character of \"Barbarella\", for which a large staff that helped with styling, hair styling and make-up was required.\n\nThe video opens with a spacecraft travelling through space. Kylie Minogue enters a small room in the spacecraft, wearing a pink spacesuit, and subsequently takes off her helmet and gloves; intercut scenes through the video has the spacecraft travelling through different space fields and atmospheres. By the first chorus, Minogue starts taking off parts of her spacesuit whilst spaceman from different rooms witness her. Next, she turns on a machine that projects smoke and distracts them. She then becomes fully nude by the second chorus; this marks Kylie Minogue's first video that she has shown full nudity in until her 2001 advert campaign with Agent Provocateur. Another spaceman witnesses Minogue nude but she covers herself with a red blanket, and closes the window. The video ends with Minogue laying on a soft bedding, turning the lights off, and the spacecraft traveling to another destination.\n\nThe music video garnered positive critiques from critics and music publications. Julie Aspinall complimented Minogue's sexual appeal in the clip, and believed that the song itself was overshadowed by its visual presentation. William Baker also commended Minogue's fashion styling and loose portrayal of Fonda's \"Barbarella\" character. Sean Smith further analysed the visual more and found that Minogue, both at the time of the video's release and retrospectively, \"was never shy about removing her clothes for the sake of her art [...] She suffered for her art.\" Jude Rogers from \"The Guardian\" labelled the clip \"cheeky\", whilst Erika Brooks Adickman from Idolator listed it as one of Minogue's most iconic and sexy music videos. At the 1995 ARIA Music Awards, Kylie Minogue won the award for Best Video. In retrospect, Minogue has cited the clip amongst one of her favourites.\n\n\"Put Yourself in My Place\" has been performed on some of Minogue's concert tours, and has appeared on several compilation albums. It was first performed live on Minogue's 1998 Intimate and Live concert tour in the opening segment. An unreleased acoustic version that was performed during the rehearsals of the tour was added on her extended play \"Live and Other Sides\", which was released in Australia as a free gift with her sixth studio album \"Impossible Princess\" (1997). This version was sung as one of the opening tracks of her 2001 On a Night Like This Tour, and was included on the live DVD of the show. On her KylieFever2002 concert tour, the single was included on Minogue's \"The Crying Game\" medley which also featured the titular track, \"Finer Feelings\", and \"Dangerous Game\". The single's next appearance was on her 2005 , where it appeared on her Minx In Space segment and served as one of the encore tracks. The song was not performed for thirteen years, until Minogue sang an acoustic version during her Kylie Presents Golden promotional tour in 2018; writing for the \"Manchester Evening News\", Katie Fitzpatrick praised the performance for being \"beautifully stripped back [...] with some fabulously confident backing vocals coming from the smitten crowd\".\n\nSince its release, it has appeared on five of Minogue's greatest hits albums: \"Hits+\" (2000), \"Confide in Me\" (2001), \"Ultimate Kylie\" (2004), \"\" (2007) and \"\" (2019).

Orchestra and soloists are usually professionals, though their services are often donated for charity benefits. The \"scratch\" name derives from the idea of cooking or building from scratch.\n\nScratch Messiah performances have their origins in the British tradition of choral societies, when large choruses of untrained amateur singers could participate in performances of large-scale concert works. Handel's Messiah was originally composed with charitable purposes in mind, having grown out of the 1749 performance of the Foundling Hospital Anthem and Handel's annual Easter performance of Messiah in the chapel of the Foundling Hospital in London. \"Messiah\" was composed so that it could be performed after a limited number of rehearsals, and thus lent itself well to the large Handel Festivals held from the 1820s onwards in Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and London. At these gatherings, large, amateur \"scratch\" choirs were formed from members of the public who travelled to the cities from all over Britain.\n\nSuch performances have become a tradition among music lovers in the English-speaking world, especially around Christmas time, and appear to be developing a following in the Netherlands and China as well. Often a \"Sing-along \"Messiah\"\" is organised in a concert hall or church, where a choir has rehearsed the music, but the public are invited to bring scores and join in. On a smaller scale, a \"Messiah\" party may take the form of a group of friends gathered around the piano in someone's home, and this is typically sung entirely \"a prima vista\". Usually these are informal events, though occasionally there is a dress code: formal concert dress or even 18th century period costume.\n\nOne example of a large-scale event is the \"Do-It-Yourself \"Messiah\"\" held in Chicago since 1976, organized by the International Music Foundation. It is held in the Harris Theater for Music and Dance. There is a volunteer orchestra and hired soloists, and the audience serves as the chorus. Similarly, CAMMAC in Canada organizes \"Come! Sing \"Messiah\"\" events. Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center is another large-scale annual event, with professional orchestra and soloists. It uses nearly two dozen conductors chosen from various choirs in New York City, who each conduct one selection from the work.. A similar event, among the first in the USA, has been held in Lexington MA since 1962.\n\nThe largest regular performance in the UK, the \"Messiah from Scratch\", is held annually at the Royal Albert Hall, London. This event, which now attracts more than 3000 singers each year, was first held in 1974. From 1979 until 2009, the performance was conducted by Sir David Willcocks.\n\n\n"}

The song was written by Wilf Smarties and Jayn Hanna, while production was handled by Brothers in Rhythm. It was released on 10 July 1995 as the third and final single from her self-titled album \"Kylie Minogue\".\n\nCommercially, the song did fairly well, peaking at number 31 in Australia, and becoming a Top 20 hit in the United Kingdom. The song has only been performed on the KylieFever2002 Tour, where it was featured in \"The Crying Game Ballad Medley\".\n\nThe song, originally a club hit for Within a Dream in 1993 was initially planned as the second single from Minogue's eponymous 1994 album, although it nearly didn't make the album's final cut at all. It was postponed for the release of \"Put Yourself in My Place\". The single was then scheduled for release in April 1995 but delayed until July while Minogue completed filming on the movie \"Bio-Dome\". The single version was radically remixed, making it almost entirely unrecognisable from its original album version. Minogue, along with BIR wrote additional lyrics for an extended version of the trip hop influenced single, called \"Where Is The Feeling (BIR Soundtrack)\". The lyrics were an early experiment to help Minogue in finding courage to write personal material, which she wanted to explore on her next album Impossible Princess.\n\nIt was considered Minogue's least successful single at the time. The single only managed to chart in two countries, these being Australia and the United Kingdom. The song debuted at number thirty-one on the Australian Singles Chart, but slipped to number thirty-eight, staying in the charts for a total of three weeks. To date, this remained Minogue's lowest and weakest-spanning solo single, until \"In My Arms\" replaced the status, where it peaked at number thirty-five and stayed in the charts for two weeks.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number sixteen on the UK Singles Chart, until descending to number sixty-three, staying in the charts for three weeks. Despite reaching the Top 20 national UK Singles Chart, the single did not spend long in the Top 75; only three weeks. Minogue's 2008 single \"The One\" stayed in the charts for three weeks, also, though did not even reach the UK Top 30.\n\nDeconstruction originally planned to accompany the song with two single releases, but it was reduced to only one CD due to new chart regulations, thus explaining the cover photo with two superimposed images of Kylie.\n\nThe song's music video was directed by Keir McFarlane, who previously collaborated with Minogue in \"Put Yourself in My Place.\" The video featuring Minogue writhing in a pool disguised as the ocean and kissing an unnamed lover while using a re-recorded version of the song remixed by Brothers in Rhythm.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The \"Morales Mix\" has two different durations depending on release. On all releases of this single, the duration of the mix is 6:12, with a fade out. The full version without the fade out is only available on releases of the previous single, Put Yourself in My Place.\n\nA video interlude of the song featured on the following concert tour:\n\nMinogue performed the song on:\n"}

(1861–1875) was a furnishings and decorative arts manufacturer and retailer founded by the artist and designer William Morris with friends from the Pre-Raphaelites. With its successor Morris & Co. (1875–1940) the firm's medieval-inspired aesthetic and respect for hand-craftsmanship and traditional textile arts had a profound influence on the decoration of churches and houses into the early 20th century.\n\nAlthough its most influential period was during the flourishing of the Arts and Crafts Movement in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris & Co. remained in operation in a limited fashion from World War I until its closure in 1940. The firm's designs are still sold today under licences given to Sanderson & Sons, part of the Walker Greenbank wallpaper and fabrics business (which owns the \"Morris & Co.\" brand,) and to Liberty of London.\n\nMorris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., \"Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals\", was jointly created by Morris, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, P. P. Marshall, and Philip Webb in 1861 to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home. The prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, stained glass, metal-work, paper-hangings, chintzes (printed fabrics), and carpets. The first headquarters of the firm were at 8 Red Lion Square in London.\n\nThe work shown by the firm at the 1862 International Exhibition attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. In the autumn of 1864, a severe illness obliged Morris to choose between giving up his home at Red House in Kent and giving up his work in London. With great reluctance he gave up Red House, and in 1865 established himself under the same roof with his workshops, which by then had relocated to larger premises in Queen Square, Bloomsbury.\n\nThe decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the Church of England in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical decoration of all kinds, especially stained glass. But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions. On its non-ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and glass wares, cloth and paper wall-hangings, embroideries, jewellery, woven and knotted carpets, silk damasks, and tapestries.\n\nMorris was producing repeating patterns for wallpaper as early as 1862, and some six years later he designed his first pattern specifically for fabric printing. As in so many other areas that interested him, Morris chose to work with the ancient technique of hand woodblock printing in preference to the roller printing which had almost completely replaced it for commercial uses.\n\nIn August 1874, Morris determined to restructure the partnership, generating a dispute with Marshall, Rossetti, and Madox Brown over the return on their shares. The company was dissolved and reorganized under Morris's sole ownership as Morris & Co. on 31 March 1875.\n\nDuring these years, Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at the Staffordshire dye works of Thomas Wardle, mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate indigo dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, like madder, which had been driven almost out of use by the anilines.\n\nDyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.\nIn June 1881, Morris relocated his dyeworks from Queen Square to an early eighteenth-century silk-throwing works at Merton Abbey Mills, after determining that the water of the River Wandle was suitable for dyeing. The complex, on , included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving.\n\nIn 1879, Morris had taught himself tapestry weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice John Henry Dearle at Queen Square. Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by Walter Crane in 1883. Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the expanded workshop at Merton Abbey, and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or cartoons by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons). and animal figures by Philip Webb. Suites of tapestries were made as part of whole-house decorating schemes, and tapestries of Burne-Jones angels and scenes from the Arthurian legends were a staple of Morris & Co. into the twentieth century.\n\nTwo significant secular commissions helped establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at St. James's Palace and the \"green dining room\" at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert) of 1867. The green dining room (preserved as the Morris Room at the V&A) featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones, panels with branches of fruit and flowers by Morris, and olive branches and a frieze by Philip Webb. The St. James's commission comprised decorative schemes for the Armoury and the Tapestry Room, and included panels of stylized floral patterns painted on ceilings, cornices, dadoes, windows, and doors.\n\nIn 1871, Morris & Co. were responsible for the windows at All Saints church in the village of Wilden near to Stourport-on-Severn. They were designed by Burne-Jones for Alfred Baldwin, his wife's brother-in-law.\n\nStanden near East Grinstead, West Sussex, was designed between 1892 and 1894 by Philip Webb for a prosperous London solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family. It is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers.\n\nStanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris & Co. before Morris's death in 1896. It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail for the dining room, to which Morris devoted his energies, the rest of the work being executed under the direction of Dearle.\n\nOther Morris & Co. commissions include the ceiling within the dining room of Charleville Forest Castle, Ireland; interiors of Bullers Wood House, now Bullers Wood School in Chislehurst, Kent; and stained glass windows at Adcote.\n\nAs Morris pursued other interests, notably socialism and the Kelmscott Press, day-to-day work at the firm was delegated. Morris's daughter May became the director of the embroidery department in 1885, when she was in her early twenties. Dearle, who had begun designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles in the late 1880s, was head designer for the firm by 1890, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at Merton Abbey.\n\nDearle's contributions to textile design were long overshadowed by Morris. Dearle exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own in the Arts and Crafts Exhibitions and the major Morris retrospective of 1899, and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as \"William Morris\" patterns.\n\nOn Morris's death in 1896, Dearle became the art director of the firm, which changed its name again, to Morris & Co. Decorators Ltd., in 1905. The company was still making good-quality stained glass into the 1920s: Holy Trinity Church, Elsecar, has several Morris & Co. windows dated 1922. Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932. The firm was finally dissolved in the early months of World War II.\n\nMorris & Co. repeating patterns were occasionally offered as both block-printed wallpapers and fabric during Morris's lifetime; many of the patterns still available are offered in both forms by their current manufacturers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2296473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296473", "title": "Zartan", "text": "Zartan\n\nZartan is a fictional character from the toyline, comic books and animated series. He is one of the main villains in the Marvel Comics series \"\" as the leader of the Dreadnoks, and a mercenary who often worked directly for Cobra Commander. His character was voiced by Zack Hoffman in the , and he was portrayed by Arnold Vosloo in the live-action film, \"\" and its 2013 sequel, \"\".\n\nZartan is a master of make-up and disguise. Very little is known of his background, but he is suspected to have received European military academy training at St. Cyr. Zartan can alter his skin color at will to blend in with his environment, and is a practitioner of several mystic martial arts. He is also a ventriloquist, a polyglot (speaking over 20 languages and dialects), and an acrobatic-contortionist. Zartan and the Dreadnoks have also been known to use holographic technology and other means to disguise themselves. He has a younger brother and sister, twins named Zandar and Zarana, as well as a daughter named Zanya.\n\nThe Dreadnoks are a fictional biker gang from the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and cartoon series. They are affiliated with Cobra as shock troops, offering their mercenary services as subordinates of Zartan.\n\nWhen Zartan was originally released in the toy line, it stated on his file card that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. After a complaint from a mental health organization, Hasbro removed this information from the file for later print runs, and was not referenced on file cards for future releases of the character. In early development, he was called Captain Chameleon. He was later named Zartan, an anagram of Tarzan, by writer Larry Hama.\n\nThe 1984 Zartan action figure featured UV reactive plastic. In its natural state, Zartan appeared Caucasian, but when exposed to sunlight, Zartan's skin changed to a dark blue. The action figure also came with thermal sensitive stickers that were applied to Zartan's chest- and thigh-armor. These stickers changed from maroon when cold, to aqua at room temperature, and blue when hot. Zartan was sold with an accompanying \"swamp skier\" called the Chameleon, which also contained thermal reactive plastic. The Chameleon could be disassembled into several parts and loaded into a small cart that was included with the action figure; the cart, loaded with the vehicle's parts, would act as part of a disguise, making Zartan appear to be a parts or junk dealer. A small face mask, included in a detachable backpack, completed the disguise. The action figures for Zartan's brother Zandar and sister Zarana were also constructed of the same UV reactive plastic.\n\nZartan was updated in 1993, as part of the Ninja Force line. A complete departure from his classic uniform, Zartan wore a leather jacket and neon green pants. Instead of a cowl, he wears a short orange mohawk on his otherwise bald head. All the Ninja Force figures were designed with a \"real ninja move\". Zartan was designed with a spring-action hip; if Zartan's right arm was pushed back, his upper torso turned right. When the arm was let go, the torso sprang back forward, resulting in a punching motion with the right arm.\n\nAfter the line was canceled in 1994, Hasbro made several attempts to resurrect A Real American Hero through repaint series. Zartan was released only once in this four-year period (1997–2001) at the tail-end. Because of difficulty obtaining the original mold, Hasbro compromised, and repainted the 1990 SAW-Viper body with a modified Zartan head. Although true to the classic look, both this figure and the Ninja Force release are unpopular reinterpretations of the character.\n\nWhen Hasbro revamped the Real American Hero toyline in 2002, Zartan made an appearance as a figure again. Zartan sports his trademark hood and an open vested shirt. This figure was offered with a variety of paint schemes including with disguises in the Spy Troops line.\n\nIn 2004, Zartan was redesigned again for Valor vs Venom. Trading his hood for a ski cap, Zartan is the furthest from his biker roots here, retaining only the recognizable face markings to make him stand out.\n\nIn a new 8\" scale, Sigma 6 figures were heavily stylized and inspired by Japanese anime. Zartan released in the \"Commando\" collection in 2006, featuring his Sigma 6 outfit. A repaint of this figure was released in 2007, featuring a new version of Zartan called \"Toxic Zartan\" featuring a new purple uniform, and green highlights.\n\n2007 was the anniversary of the launch of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, the third major reinvention of the G.I. Joe brand since 1964. To celebrate, Hasbro created new figures based on the A Real American Hero line, featuring modern sculpting with updated and increased articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe's trademark O-Ring construction). Zartan was unveiled at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con, and the figure, based on designs from the Devil's Due comic series, included a removable mask and also changes color like its 1980s counterpart. A second 25th Anniversary-era figure, more closely hewing to the original figure from 1984, was released in 2008 that does not change color, but came with a scaled down version of the Chameleon swamp skier and two removable masks. Zartan was also released on the G.I. Joe Hall of Heroes Line to commemorate the 25th anniversary figures. He came with three face masks, his trademark pistol and a sniper rifle.\n\nZartan was released in the second wave of figures for the Pursuit of Cobra line in 2010. In a review of the action figure, MTV said that Zartan \"one of the few JOE-verse characters that weren't stripped of all their coolness in the recent film\", though still praised the action figure for not referencing the film, calling the figure \"all-around amazing\".\n\nZartan first appeared in issue #24 of the Marvel Comics series. He was fully introduced in \"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\" #25 (July 1984). Zartan can imitate anyone he wishes to an exact physical and vocal likeness.\n\nZartan was featured in issue #48, where he had been brought into The Pit, the Joe's Headquarters, disguised as an injured Joe, Ripcord. He almost escapes, by impersonating various Joes, such as Doc, Tripwire, General Hawk and Gung-Ho. Zartan is confronted by Sgt. Slaughter while impersonating Gung-Ho, as the real Gung-Ho is standing next to him. Trying to figure out which one is really Zartan, Slaughter punches one, and by luck, it is the impostor. Zartan eventually does escape, with the help of the Dreadnoks. This leads to Cobra Commander's assault, which destroys the Pit.\n\nZartan is famous for delivering the killing blow to Serpentor during the Cobra Civil War, by shooting the Cobra emperor in the eye, with the same longbow that he used to kill the Hard Master years ago. After the war, Zartan leaves Cobra and the Dreadnoks, while his sister continues to work with Cobra. Zartan disguises himself as the Arashikage Blind Master, in order to mentor a boy named Tyrone. He eventually returns to Cobra Island, along with Billy, Captain Minh, and Tyrone, to expose Fred VII as an impostor pretending to be Cobra Commander. The mission is interrupted by the return of the real Cobra Commander, who traps Billy, Zartan, Fred VII, Tyrone, Captain Minh, Raptor, and several others in a landlocked freighter, which he then buries under a volcano. After several months of digging, Billy and Zartan manage to escape, while most of the others die from tainted food.\n\nZartan also faced off against Shipwreck in the UK Action Force series.\n\nZartan and his siblings, Zack and Zoe, grew up sometime during the early 1970s. As a child, he was diagnosed with an unknown mental health condition requiring medication. They were raised by their French actress mother and movie-mask sculptor father. They grew up in a broken home with a temperamental father.\n\nSometime after he began working as an assassin and mercenary, using his disguise abilities. Zartan also worked for a government agency under the name Amauri Sanderson. He underwent a top-secret French genetic experiment, which infused him with chameleon DNA, giving him the ability to blend into his background. During an arms deal with Destro, Amauri Sanderson met the leader of a motorcycle gang who was the original Zartan. Amauri joined the Dreadnoks and reunited with Zandar and Zarana. He was later approached by several Dreadnoks for the purpose of overthrowing the leader, who considered all the members expendable. When the insurrection was exposed, the leader planned to have Amauri executed by dismemberment. Zandar and Zarana incited a rival gang to attack, which gave them the opportunity to free their brother. The traitorous Dreadnoks teamed up with the rival gang, and Amauri fought and overpowered the leader and his rivals. With no one left to back him up, the leader was killed by Buzzer, Torch, and Ripper, and Amauri assumed the identity of Zartan.\n\nZartan is introduced in \"G.I. Joe Origins\". He was orphaned as a young boy, and made his way by pickpockets on the street. When he was confronted by the local police, he gave them the name \"Zartan\" that he saw on a movie poster behind them, eventually adopting it at the beginning of his named career. Years later, Zartan is a Cobra agent answering directly to Baroness. He was tasked with infiltrating a presidential airliner, to ensure the continued cooperation of President Rumanapar. His mission is a success, and he contacts Baroness for extraction. Displeased with Zartan, Baroness sends him to be a test subject for Destro's teleportation device. Destro sends him to assassinate Nico Mandirobilis; however, the teleportation process was not finalized, and Zartan's body quickly disintegrated.\n\nWith Zartan's complete genetic map stored in the M.A.S.S.' Relay Star Satellites, Cobra geneticist Doctor Taggac was able to brew a plasmid medium, which injected into a blank clone body, reformatted the slug into a copy of Zartan. The body was corrupt, with unstable skin lividity, numerous cancers, renal failure and more. Taggac used bio-magnetic pads to stabilize the body, and began teaching Zartan how to live again. This instruction included both physical elements and basic language and math skills. Zartan's unique biology gave him the ability to change his appearance and skin tone, a skill which Taggac attempted to keep secret from Cobra. Eventually the magnetic pads were surgically implanted beneath the skin, giving him a normal appearance. He expressed a desire to leave the lab and go to the outside world, and days later he kills a guard and poses as wait staff, to escape before anyone notices he was gone.\n\nCobra agents track him using a subcutaneous transmitter, but he evades them, fakes his own death, and sneaks back into the lab. He pulls a gun on Taggac, and forces him to contact Cobra Commander. Zartan negotiates his services as an assassin, and when the terms are agreed upon, he kills Taggac.\n\nZartan later reappeared in IDW's reboot of Mobile Armoured Strike Kommand. Here, he identifies as \"Emil Zartan\" and infiltrates the MASK team to steal their technology so he can sell it.\n\nZartan first appeared in the \"\" mini-series \"The Revenge of Cobra\", along with Dreadnoks Buzzer, Ripper and Torch. He and the Dreadnoks abduct Colonel Sharp, so that Zartan can impersonate him and free Cobra Commander from prison. In the cartoon, his disguise techniques are all masks, make-up and vocal impersonating techniques. In \"The Revenge of Cobra\", Zartan and the Dreadnoks recover a piece of Destro's Weather Dominator, offering to sell it to the highest bidder, Cobra or G.I. Joe.\n\nZartan is also initially able to change the color of his skin to perfectly blend in with his background. Zartan's camouflage abilities are negated by the sun, causing his skin to turn blue (much like his action figure), and weakening him significantly. However, both aspects were dropped almost immediately after the first season began. \"Jungle Trap\" was the last episode to showcase this particular ability.\n\nZartan appeared throughout season one of the cartoon, and was one of the few Cobra characters to carry over to season two, along with Cobra Commander, Baroness and Destro. In the second season of \"G.I. Joe\", he expanded the Dreadnoks to include his younger siblings, Zarana and Zandar, as well as Monkeywrench and Thrasher. The Zartan of the cartoon had a rivalry with Destro, who considered Zartan a petty criminal. He was also a more cowardly character, often fleeing battle when things turned against him. His loyalty usually lay with Cobra Commander, even after Serpentor took control of Cobra. Zartan also helped Cobra replace people with Synthoids in one episode.\n\nIn \"\", Zartan is seen being angry with Cobra Commander, for blaming his lacking courage on the troops. Zartan is given a valuable gem by Pythona of Cobra-La, so that he and his Dreadnoks will aid them in freeing Serpentor. They accomplish their task, but Zartan himself is curiously absent from then on, and is not seen during the final battle at the film's climax.\n\nZartan appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movie \"\", voiced by Colin Murdock.\n\nZartan appeared in \"\". His disguise techniques are due to hologram generators in his suit.\n\nZartan makes two appearances in the \"\" series.\n\nZartan first appears in the \"\" episode \"Dreadnoks Rising\" as the leader of the Dreadnoks. He reappeares in \"Knockoffs\" and \"Cutting Edge.\"\n\nZartan is played by Arnold Vosloo in Stephen Sommers's film \"\", with a drastically different appearance than his television counterpart. He is a master of disguise, able to mimic other peoples' mannerisms and characteristics. Sent by McCullen with the Baroness and Storm Shadow, Zartan breaks into the Pit and disguises himself as a G.I. Joe Pit member. He murders Cover Girl with a knife as she reports to General Hawk, taking them by surprise. When the two Cobra agents fight their way out soon after, Zartan takes an alternate route and kills off a nearby Bedouin, donning his clothing to escape detection by Pit members.\n\nLater, with the help of nanotechnology provided by The Doctor's nanomites, Zartan gains his ability to assume exact physical appearances for a special mission (but without the mind control elements, since he quickly broke away from the machine to keep his free will). During the final battle, Zartan is sent to America using the missile crisis as a cover, where he infiltrates the White House as part of Cobra's plans for world domination, and assumes the identity of the President of the United States. Several times in the film, he whistles the tune \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\", including at the end of the film, confirming that he has taken the place of the President.\n\nVosloo reprises his role as Zartan in the 2013 sequel \"\", with a much larger role. According to Vosloo, Zartan is still in disguise as the U.S. president and he has the world leaders all under his thumb, war heads headed towards innocent populaces, and some new heavies on the payroll, to keep G.I. Joe at bay. Zartan orders air-strikes on the G.I. Joes and kills a majority of them. He is later revealed to have been the one who killed the Hard Master and raised Storm Shadow as a ruthless assassin. Zartan is eventually killed by his former student, at which time his guise as the President finally fades.\n\nZartan is one of the featured villains in the 1985 \"\" computer game.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France, from the centre of Paris.\n\nInhabitants of Orsay are known as \"Orcéens\".\n\nThere has been a village called Orsay on this site since 999, and the first church there was built in 1157. From the sixteenth century, the town and surrounding area were owned by the Boucher family, and it was in honour of this family that Louis XIV gave the \"quai d'Orsay\" its name. This is the reason that the Musée d'Orsay is not in Orsay. In the eighteenth century, the family of Grimod du Fort bought the land and received the title of comte d'Orsay.\nIn 1870, during the Franco-Prussian war, Orsay was occupied by the Prussian army.\n88 young \"Orcéens\" were killed in the First World War.\n\nIn 1957, largely due to the influence of Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie, the Institut de physique nucléaire (nuclear physics institute) was opened in the Chevreuse valley, and the region, especially Orsay, became an important scientific centre. Another development was the creation of the Université de Paris-Sud, whose most important faculty is the faculty of science.\n\nOn 19 February 1977, a part of the territory of Orsay was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Bures-sur-Yvette to create the commune of Les Ulis.\n\nOrsay is served by two stations on Paris RER line B: Le Guichet and Orsay-Ville.\n\n\n\nOrsay has one Catholic church: Saint-Martin – Saint-Laurent, opposite the town hall.\nIt also has an International Evangelical Church called Église Évangélique Vie et Paix at 14 Rue Charles de Gaulle.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2296501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296501", "title": "Some Kind of Bliss", "text": "Some Kind of Bliss\n\n\"Some Kind of Bliss\" is a song recorded by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, for her sixth studio album \"Impossible Princess\" (1997). The song was released as the lead single from the album on 8 September 1997 through BMG, Deconstruction and Mushroom. Minogue co-wrote the track with James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore while Bradfield and Dave Eringa produced it. Backed by guitar and drum instruments, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" is a Britpop track in which Minogue sings about feeling happy.\n\nCritical response to \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was mostly mixed; earlier reviews were critical towards her image and sound transition to rock music, while retrospective reviews are positive towards her songwriting and sonic experimentation. \"Some Kind of Bliss\" performed relatively poorly on international charts peaking at number twenty-seven on the Australian Singles Chart, at 22 on the UK Singles Chart (her first solo release to miss the UK Top 20) and reaching number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.\n\nTo promote \"Some Kind of Bliss\", she performed the track on \"Top of the Pops\", MTV Australia live and the Australian TV series \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\". It was later included on her 1998 concert tour Intimate and Live Tour. David Mould directed the music video to the single, featuring Minogue and actor Dexter Fletcher robbing a gas station. The song was later included in the track list of Minogue's compilation albums including \"Confide in Me\" (2002), \"\" (2004), \"\" (2007) and \"\" (2019).\n\nAfter releasing the single \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" with Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on 2 October 1995, Minogue received acclaim from critics for her experimentation with rock music, who praised her transition from being the once-dubbed \"singing budgie\" to a mature woman. Because of this, Minogue, with the support of her then boyfriend Stephane Sednaoui, decided to experiment with her music for the upcoming album. Welsh musician James Dean Bradfield contacted Minogue's A&R Pete Hadfield, asking him what their current project was where Hadfield replied \"Kylie Minogue's new album\". He asked Hadfield if he could work with Minogue and was approved.\n\nAfter Bradfield sent her a demo of the album track \"I Don't Need Anyone\", Minogue was dissatisfied with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it \"difficult\" to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of \"I Don't Need Anyone\". She found this method of writing \"intriguing\" and wanted to do it again, so she decided to do this with \"Some Kind of Bliss\", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying \"He took one half of one set [of lyrics] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things.\" She later commented that she felt it worked together.\n\nWhile in production for the album, creative production was handled by Minogue and producers Brothers in Rhythm. Deconstruction Records' A&R Pete Hadfield was concerned with the lack of single choices, where he felt the songs written by Minogue were not up to commercial standards. Because of this, a potential January 1997 single release was postponed to make the album \"perfect\". \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was released as the lead single from \"Impossible Princess\" on 8 September 1997. There are two songs on the CD editions off \"Some Kind of Bliss\": \"Limbo\", a track was rejected as a single, and a new song \"Love Takes Over Me\".\n\n\"Some Kind of Bliss\" was written by Minogue herself alongside Welsh performers James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore, while the production was handled by Bradfield and Dave Eringa. It was recorded at Mayfair Studios, London, England in 1997, and was mixed by Alan Bremnar at Roundhouse Studios. It is a Britpop song with alternative rock and \"rock-tinged\" elements that lasts a duration of four minutes and thirteen seconds on the album. Instrumentally, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" features bass, electric and acoustic guitars, drums, string sections, flute, and a saxophone. Lyrically, the song is about Minogue's experiences while away from people and being happy, saying: \"To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [...] the ability to feel like they're with you even if they are a million miles away.\"\n\nA reviewer from Sputnikmusic said \"'Some Kind of Bliss' is one of the more pop-rock songs that could have been part of her earlier work. This gem breaks up the dominance of the sleepy trance vibe to a more upbeat feel.\" Michael R. Smith from \"The Daily Vault\" felt that it was \"surprisingly a strong and straightforward rock\" song. Nick Levine from Digital Spy labelled the music as \"Motowny Indie\", while Sarah Smith from FasterLouder called it \"pure pop\". Priya from \"NME\" said \"Some Kind of Bliss\" is \"a brassy 60's influenced number which has a totally \"Everything Must Go\" vibe to it.\" Martin Power, who wrote the biography \"Nailed to History: The Story of the Manic Street Preachers\" (2012) for the Manic Street Preachers, commented that \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was \"far away from Minogue's glory days of 'I Should Be So Lucky' and 'Better the Devil You Know' as it was possible to get.\" A reviewer from \"The Australian\" noticed the transition from Minogue's earlier work by saying \"The new single is not as heavily produced as her past songs, leaving her voice sounding edgier, and guitars take the place of the drum machine beats of earlier efforts.\"\n\nInitial reviews toward \"Some Kind of Bliss\" were mixed. Writing for \"NME\" in November 1997, Ben Willmott called it \"supremely irritating\" and stated \"Kylie belts out the lyrics like she's reading from an autocue. Any soul is lost in a slurry of bought-in brass and a ropey guitar solo that's be more at home on a Shakin' Stevens record.\" John Magnan from \"The Age\" said while the song was a stand out to the album, it \"is actually one of the album's clunkier tracks\". A reviewer from \"Music Week\" awarded the song four stars out of five, stating \"Kylie changes musical tack again with this dense, big sounding single, co-written with two of the Manics, which loudly announces she's back in style.\" Gareth Gorman said that while the song showcased Minogue's \"thin vocals\", he followed saying \"it still works due to one of those melody lines that is inevitable stunning, simple and effective.\" Michael Dwyer from \"Western Australia\" magazine stated \"Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time that Stock, Aitken and Waterman ever dreamed of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow.\" Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" was positive, saying \"Ms. Minogue has been reborn as an alterna-pop vixen to be reckoned with.\"\n\nThe song received more positive reviews in retrospect. Allmusic's Chris True had selected the song as an album stand out and a career stand out track. While reviewing her 2002 compilation \"Confide in Me\", True stated “\"Impossible Princess\", both of which found her stretching and growing beyond the pop princess image she had previously. Dark, noisy tracks like \"Limbo,\" the trip-hoppy \"Jump,\" and the more rock-oriented \"I Don't Need Anyone\" and \"Some Kind of Bliss\"—both of which were co-written by the Manic Street Preachers' James Dean Bradfield—found her trying on different styles to replace the bubblegum pop of the past.” A reviewer from \"Who Magazine\" called the song \"Funky , Spunky, Rocky, Big.\" Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music reviewed her \"Ultimate Kylie\" compilation album, and criticised the musical composition by calling it an \"awkward faux-rock\". Matt James from PopMatters reviewed her compilation \"The Best of Kylie Minogue\" and was disappointed with \"Some Kind of Bliss\"' absence, labelling it a \"lost classic\". In 2017, \"Billboard\" ranked it as the 76th greatest pop song of 1997; Andrew Unterberger wrote that \"the song's string-soaked guitar-pop remains surprisingly alluring, a fascinating glimpse at an alternate reality in which the disco diva is better remembered for ripped jeans than golden hot pants, and sounds no less like herself for it\". Writing for the \"Herald Sun\", Cameron Adams placed it at number 21 on his list of the singer's best songs in honor of her 50th birthday, calling it \"the peak of 'Indie Kylie' [...] a modern retro ‘60s girl band garage pop heaven, filled with brass, sass and class\".\n\nThe song entered at twenty-seven on the Australian Singles Chart and fell to thirty-nine the following week. \"Some Kind of Bliss\" stayed in the chart for six weeks, and resulted as her lowest-charting lead single from an album until her single \"Into the Blue\" from \"Kiss Me Once\" (2014) peaked at forty-six. The song entered and peaked at number forty-six on the New Zealand Singles Chart for a sole week, her lowest charting single after her 1988 single \"It's No Secret\". In the United Kingdom, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" entered at number twenty-two on 20 September 1997, which broke Minogue's consecutive top twenty hits and became her lowest solo single until \"Better than Today\" from \"Aphrodite\" (2010) at thirty-two on 20 November 2010.\n\nThe music video was directed by David Mould and was shot in the Desert of Tabernas in Spain. The music video features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue's lover. The video is set in non-linear structure, as it opens with Minogue and Fletcher in a blue cadillac at a gas station, with Minogue staring inside the gas station while Fletcher sits in the car after being released from jail. Several scenes feature Minogue and Fletcher in different outfits in different areas, driving and running around a hotel. There are scenes with Minogue and Fletcher fighting, being happy and playing around in there hotel room.\n\nDuring the bridge sequence, Minogue and Fletcher park in front of a shop, and Minogue seductively tries to distract the cashier outside by staring and posing at him, while Fletcher tries to steal money from the till. In the last scenes, Minogue is in another outfit trying to walk out of an alley with a bag of money, but sees a police car driving towards her and tries to walk off. Fletcher is caught by police and is escorted into the police car while yelling at Minogue. Minogue, who see the alteration, drives off with the money and looks back at Fletcher while driving down the street.\n\nRobbie Daw from Idolator listed the video at eight on their Kylie Minogue's Sexiest Videos. Daw said \"There's something so casually sexy about this Bonnie and Clyde-themed video. Kylie spends a lot of time wearing skimpy denim dresses while dealing with the fallout from her criminal love interest.\" The public had voted in which Minogue's video was the sexiest. Conversely, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was put in last place with 1% of the votes (15 votes). The music video was featured on the first CD single of her November 1997 single \"Did It Again\", and was included on her video compilations: \"The Kylie Tapes 94–98\" (1998), \"Greatest Hits 87–99\" (2003) and \"Artist Collection\" (2004).\n\nTo promote the single, Minogue performed the song on several televised shows. Her debut live performance of the single was on the Australian variety program \"Hey Hey It's Saturday\". She went on to perform the single on MTV on 4 October 1997 and in the UK on both \"TFI Friday\" and \"Top of the Pops\". \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was included on the set list for her 1998 concert tour Intimate and Live. The song was featured on the opening act for the tour and featured Minogue singing the track on stage, wearing a black long-collared shirt and three-quarter pants, similar to the costume off \"Did It Again\". Like the rest of the costumes on the tour including the performance off \"Some Kind of Bliss\", it features Minogue with a lot of \"princess\"-inspired outfits.\n\n\"Some Kind of Bliss\" has been recognized by critics as Minogue's most \"indie\"-influenced song to date and one of her least successful singles to date. Author Lee Barron, who wrote the book \"Social Theory in Popular Culture\", discussed the \"Impossible Princess\" period and further stated that \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was one of the main aspects for her \"Indie Kylie\" label in the media. Craig Mathieson, who wrote the book \"Playlisted: Everything You Need to Know about Australian Music Right Now\" (2009), stated about the song \"It was a statement of intent, but not as planned. A sense of freedom, a belief in the lure of happiness, did not suit Kylie. She's best defined by constriction ad reduction, an her music has subsequently become a soundtrack to lack of choice.\"\n\nThe poor reception prompt Hadfield to release an apology to Minogue, blaming himself for not being in control of the promotion; \"I loved her voice, got on with her and I am embarrassed that I failed her.\" Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003-release of \"Impossible Princess\", had observed that critics slated \"Some Kind of Bliss\" due to Minogue's approach to \"obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole\". Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath \"I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start.\" She went on to say \"I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands.\" She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on \"good terms\".\n\n\"Some Kind of Bliss\" has been featured on many of Minogue's compilation albums. Its first appearance was on her 2000 Deconstruction greatest hits \"Hits+\" and on her 2001 BMG greatest hits compilation album \"Confide in Me\", a compilation consisting majority off her singles and tracks from her Deconstruction period; Heather Phares from Allmusic praised the \"Impossible Princess\" tracks including \"Some Kind of Bliss\". It then appeared on her 2004 compilation albums \"Artist Collection\" and, which included most of her \"Impossible Princess\" era. The appeared on the first disc of \"\" released in July 2007 by UK independent label Music Club and her \"K25: Time Capsule\" by Warner Music Australia in October 2012. The song also appears on the third disc of \"\" released in November 2019. The Quivver remix appeared on her 1998 remix compilations \"Mixes\" and \"Impossible Remixes\".\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Some Kind of Bliss\".\n\nCD single\n\nPromotional CD\n\n7\" vinyl\n12\" vinyl\n\nCassette tape\n\nDigital download and music video\nSong credits\n\nVisual credits\n\n\n"}

Shredder instructs Perry to use the ooze to mutate an Alligator Snapping Turtle and a Gray Wolf (kidnapped from the Bronx Zoo) which resulted in the creation of Tokka and Rahzar. However, Jordan had secretly altered the mutagen, and as a result, the two mutants had the intelligence of human infants. Shredder ordered the monsters to face him in battle, to teach them who their master was, except the infantile mutants misinterpreted the word \"master\", thinking it meant \"mamma\", and hugged him instead. Angered, Shredder ordered them to be destroyed, but Perry had sympathy for them and showed Saki their total obedience to him and that, as they were \"playing\" in the junkyard, partially lifting a skid steer, they had great strength. This prompted Shredder to keep them alive.\n\nDespite their low intelligence, the two mutant's incredible physical strength made them more than a match for the Turtles. On their first encounter at Shredder and Tatsu's junkyard base, the Turtles were ill-prepared and barely managed to escape when trying to save their brother Raphael from capture and rescue Dr. Perry. During the escape they trapped Tokka in a manhole from the waist down. Michaelangelo teased Tokka and tickled the bottom of the snapper's clawed feet. Later that night, Shredder let them loose in the city, telling to 'go play', which they did by tipping over cars, knocking down telephone poles, and trashing buildings. After doing a report on the devastation the next day, April O'Neil was confronted by the Foot with a message for the Turtles: If they didn't meet the Foot at a construction site near the docks that night, Shredder would set Tokka and Rahzar out again into Central Park. As many people would get hurt, the Turtles and Splinter agreed that there was no other choice but to face Shredder, regardless of their disadvantage against Tokka and Rahzar's immense strength. However, the professor had a plan; with the help of Donatello and Keno and using the contamination in the ooze that mutated Tokka and Rahzar as a basis, Dr. Perry prepared an anti-mutagen to de-mutate them, which had to be ingested.\n\nDuring their second encounter at the construction site, amidst a distraction, Leonardo and Michaelangelo trick Tokka and Rahzar into eating the antidote (they froze the concoction into ice cubes and then hid them in a box of donuts, which they then offered to the two mutants as the \"ritual of the traditional pre-fight donut\"). Rahzar and Tokka devoured some of the donuts with continued coaxing from the Turtles. Surprisingly, Rahzar, regardless of his infant-like mentality, figured that something was wrong with the situation, and crushed one of the donuts in his claw, discovering the anti-mutagen cube hidden inside. Enraged at what they assumed was an attempt to poison them, Tokka and Rahzar attacked the Turtles with Rahzar grabbing Michaelangelo by the hands and spinning him around before smashing him through a wall and into the Dockshore Club, interrupting a crowded dance concert by Vanilla Ice.\n\nAs the final showdown commenced at the club, Leo and Raph were fending off Rahzar and Tokka's snapping attacks. Dr. Perry informed Donatello that carbon dioxide was essential to the demutation process and their repeated burping was slowing down what little anti-mutagen they had ingested. To speed the process back up, the Turtles knocked their foes off their feet and flat on their backs with a couple of barrels they found somewhere in the concert, and then the turtles shoved fire extinguishers into the creatures' mouths, which administered the needed carbon dioxide to reverse the mutation. Finally, the antidote took effect and the two mutants returned to their normal animal forms. What happened to them after this is unknown, though it is most likely that they could've been sent back to the Bronx Zoo.\nDuring the course of \"Turtles Forever\", Ch'rell the Utrom Shredder uses mutagen obtained from the universe of the 1987 animated series to mutate his human troops, with two of these mutated soldiers taking on forms identical to Tokka and Rahzar. However, they are later dispatched by the 2003 incarnations of Donatello and Raphael with the aid of the 1987 Party Wagon.\n\nTokka and Rahzar only appeared once in the seventh season of the 1987 animated series. In 1993, they were featured in the season 7 episode \"Dirk Savage: Mutant Hunter\". They were out-of-control mutants created when the Shredder exposed zoo animals to mutagen years earlier (whether this refers to when he created Bebop and Rocksteady or Groundchuck and Dirtbag, is not made clear).\n\nNot long after their first battle with the Turtles at the Crystal Palace Mall, they were captured by Dirk Savage. The animated versions were more intelligent and more eloquent, particularly Rahzar. Rahzar states to Tokka, \"...You are my only friend.\"\n\nTokka has a very uncontrolled appetite which leads him into Dirk Savage's trap which consists of a buffet. The Snapper gets captured by the Mutant Hunter after he devours the smorgasbord. Even though Rahzar made a big deal of his friend being captured, and he was shown attacking Dirk later on, it was never shown if he ever got reunited with Tokka, even after the bad guys were defeated.\n\nTheir look in the cartoon was very much like that of their action figures, made two years prior to their animated appearance.\n\nIn this episode, their names were spelled \"Toka\" and \"Razar\".\n\nToka was voiced by Rob Paulsen while Razar was voiced by Townsend Coleman.\n\nIn the 2012 \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" animated series, Tokka and Rahzar are portrayed with drastically different origins than past incarnations. So much so that they are never seen together in this series, with Tokka's role as Rahzar's partner given to Fishface, an original character.\n\nRahzar (voiced by Clancy Brown) starts the series as a celebrity martial artist, Chris Bradford (who bears a resemblance to Chuck Norris). But Bradford is revealed to have been secretly trained by Shredder, who gave his student a twisted version of the events of Tang Shen's death where Hamato Yoshi was the one who betrayed their friendship. Bradford grew to respect Yoshi, acknowledging he was as powerful as his master, but believed he would never go through with killing his enemy. During the first season, when Shredder arrived to New York City, Bradford is tasked to hunt down Yoshi through the turtles. He tricks Michelangelo into a faux friendship to get to them. Bradford reveals his deception when he has captured the turtle, sparking a bitter hatred from him. After this plot failed to kill the Turtles and a repeated failure, the Shredder became enraged at his lieutenant's incompetence. This drove Bradford to kill the turtles even if it meant his own death when he confronts the Turtles near a Kraang mutagen bomb with fellow Foot member Xever Montes. Though the bomb was defused, Bradford was exposed to the mutagen alongside Xever. Having been previously bitten by Shredder's pet akita, Bradford became a large dog mutant with increased strength that Michelangelo dubbed Dogpound as he was a dog who always pounded them into the ground. Despite his attempts to redeem himself, expressing disdain for his mutant status and lack of agility, Dogpound finds himself on the bad end of several vicious beatings from his master before replaced by Karai as Shredder's second in command.\n\nWhen given the takes to retrieve Baxter Stockman after he escaped the Foot's custody, Dogpound believing the scientist can turn him human again. But during an ensuing fight with the turtles, Dogpound is knocked into a mutagen vat and is painfully mutated further into a skeletal zombie-like werewolf mutant. Renamed Rahzar by Michelangelo, he takes some pride in his new form despite Shredder's initial comment that he looked terrible. When Tiger Claw is named the new second-in-command, Rahzar forms a sincere friendship with him while revealed to be third-in-command of the Foot whenever Shredder or Tiger Claw are absent. In the third-season finale, \"Annihilation: Earth!\", Rahzar joined in the alliance between the turtles and Foot Clan in an effort to save the world. Rahzar battled several Triceratons before watching in shock as Shredder killed Splinter in an act that doomed Earth to destroyed by the black hole generator. But in the fourth-season episode, \"Earth's Last Stand\", the Turtles create a new timeline when they save the Earth from the Triceratons, negating Rahzar's death in the process.\n\nWhen his master was mutated into the Super Shredder, Rahzar took part in the climactic clash with the combined forces of the Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals. Rahzar ran afoul of Leatherhead, who used his massive size and strength to easily overpower Rahzar, and dragged him to the bottom of the river, drowning him. In the fifth-season episode, \"The Forgotten Swordsman\", Tiger Claw orders an annoyed Fishface to retrieve Rahzar's corpse from the river, and has Kavaxas resurrect him. Overjoyed at having been brought back to life, Rahzar finds himself questioning his loyalty when Hattori Tatsu arrives in New York, offering him a place as his right-hand man in his new Foot Clan. Rahzar ultimately remains loyal to the Shredder, but is repulsed and terrified when Kavaxas resurrects him as a shambling corpse. When Tiger Claw realizes that Shredder is only living to serve Kavaxas' will, it is revealed that Rahzar has suffered much of the same fate, as Kavaxas takes control of his body and refers to Rahzar as his \"undead warrior\". After dueling Tiger Claw, Rahzar falls into a pit to the netherworld, and is not seen again, potentially dead for good this time.\n\nIn season four of the series, Tokka is introduced as a monstrous alien guardian of the final piece of the Black Hole Generator on the planet of ever-burning fire, Magdomar, of the end of the known cosmos. This version of Tokka, bearing a resemblance to Gamera with similar abilities, is asexual but is referred as female as she is the parent of Chompy Picasso, an alien turtle that Raphael becomes attached to and becomes a father to it. Lord Dregg is able to steal the Black Hole Generator piece from Tokka, who attempts to recover before being seemingly destroyed by the explosion of a dwarf star triggered by the Triceratons, though Chompy survives and remains with the Turtles. It is later revealed to have survived and angrily crash lands on Earth to find her baby whom Raphael had adopted as Chompy Picasso but decides to let Raphael take care of her baby after seeing how much they have bonded. Raphael decides to keep Chompy, though he knows the creature will eventually have to leave Earth.\n\nTokka and Razhar appeared in two non-canon stories in the Turtle Soup limited series. Tokka was April O'Neil's pet snapping turtle who bit Raphael and became Tokka due to Raphael's mutagen blood. Razhar was a mutated dog created by Krang.\n\nIn the current TMNT comic series, published by IDW, Slash bears resemblance to Tokka.\n\nAlthough the old TMNT video games are based on the 1987 cartoon version of the franchise, and the first game listed here came out in 1991, two years before Tokka and Rahzar appeared on that show, the two mutants are nonetheless part of three of the games.\n\nThey are in both versions of \"\" once again voiced by Frank Welker. In the original arcade version, they are the bosses of the pirate ship level, while in the Super NES version, they have been moved to the new Technodrome level. They are paired together as a boss fight. They can team up in their attacks in the SNES version; one of their moves involves Tokka withdrawing into his shell and Rahzar hopping on top and riding around the screen chaotically like a skateboard. Their low intelligence from the movie is also included in the game: they will often accidentally hit each other instead of the player, and will take damage for it. In the Super NES version, Tokka is also able to use an ice breath attack, while Rahzar uses a fire breath attack. Just like in the movie, when the player defeats them in the game, they de-mutate to normal animals. It is possible to attack Rahzar after he has de-mutated. He makes a 'Yelp' sound. Also, in the game, their names have the spelling of the movie, not the later spelling of the TV show. The Super NES version borrows a quote from the movie which Tokka and Rahzar said, right before the fight: \"Master say have fun.\" \"FUN!\" In the movie, they say this when they are tearing up a backstreet to lure the Turtles into a confrontation.\n\nThey also made an appearance in the NES game \"\". Here the player fights them individually in separate instances. Rahzar appears in the Technodrome level immediately before Shredder, and uses an ice breath attack. Tokka appears as the boss of the rooftop level and carries a shield for blocking jump kicks. Rahzar's name is spelled \"Rahzer\" in the game's ending sequence.\n\nThey also return in the modern remake \"\" for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. They again are featured as a double-boss in the pirate ship level.\n\n"}

The system is surrounded by a dusty ring.\n\nThe dust that orbits around several hundred main-sequence stars is cold and comes from a Kuiper-belt analogous region. In the Solar System the ongoing collisions between asteroids generate a tenuous cloud of dust known as the zodiacal light. When the Solar System was young such collisions were more common and the rate of dust production was probably many times higher. Zodiacal dust around stars much younger than the Sun has been rarely found. Only a few main-sequence stars have revealed warm (>120 K) zodiacal dust.\n\nAn exceptionally large amount of warm, small, silicate dust particles around the solar-type star BD+20°307 (HIP 8920, SAO 75016) has been reported. The composition, quantity and temperature of the dust may be explained by recent, frequent or huge collisions between asteroids or other planetesimals whose orbits are being perturbed by a nearby planet.\n\nBoth stars of the close binary are considered to be Solar-type stars that are slightly more massive than the Sun. The two stars differ in effective temperature by only ~250 K and have a mass ratio of 0.91. The two orbit a common center of mass every 3.42 days. Within the spectra of the two stars the Li lines show different equivalent widths. The Li 6707 Å line though weak is detected only from the primary star, suggesting that it is older than 1 Gyr. If so, the large amount of zodiacal dust around the binary must be from a very large and recent collision of planetesimals.\n\nRecent measurements indicate that the binary star system has an age of several billion years — comparable to the Solar System.\n\nThe dust cloud orbiting BD+20°307 has about 1 million times more dust than is orbiting the Sun. Furthermore, the dust is made up of extremely tiny particles, and its temperature is over 100 K, which is unusually high. It is hypothesized that, within the past few hundred thousand years and perhaps much more recently, these particles were formed by a collision between two bodies similar to Earth. \"It's as if Earth and Venus collided,\" said Prof. Benjamin Zuckerman, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy. \"Astronomers have never seen anything like this before. Apparently, major catastrophic collisions can take place in a fully mature planetary system.\" This hypothesis explains why the bulk of this dust has not spiraled into BD+20°307, or been pushed out by stellar winds yet. The National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, Tennessee State University (TSU) and the State of Tennessee funded the work by Zuckerman and his collaborators.\n\nAs of 2006 there were 7 sun-like stars that have hot dust at < 10 AU.

That criticism came in a review of Noble's \"Brain and Its Psychology\" and his renunciation was formally recorded in his \"Elements of Psychological Medicine\", published in 1853.\n\nNoble's views on mental illness influenced the terminology introduced by Henry Monro.\n\nOn 9 February 1847, Noble assisted his friend, Manchester surgeon James Braid, to (successfully) conduct a mastectomy, using inhalation ether as an anaesthetic agent.

He loved to play music, and persuaded Selena to play music. Although she initially complained she didn't want to, she later found that she actually loved to play. Selena herself joined the family band at the age of ten, and they turned professional two years later. Selena not only sang in some concerts that her father arranged, but she also sang in school whenever she was asked. Selena's father discovered her amazing voice, and spread musical talents (which he pursued himself in his earlier days) among his two older children: Abraham III (A.B.), was put on the bass guitar, and Suzette, was put on drums. The family first showcased their band on street corners, at quinceañeras, and at other family gatherings until Selena's father opened up a much-needed Mexican restaurant in Lake Jackson, Texas called \"Papágayos\" () in 1981. While her parents took care of the restaurant, Selena performed for the first time in public at the age of nine with her older siblings to entertain the diners. However, the restaurant began to lose its customers when the recession of 1981 hit South Texas and the restaurant was forced into foreclosure. Soon after the restaurant's closure, Selena's family moved their musical aspirations to Corpus Christi, Texas. There, Selena began to gain popularity and respect as a child singer.\n\nWithin a year, the family's restaurant went bankrupt and the family was forced to move in with relatives, as Abraham had quit his job to manage the restaurant full-time. The band then performed wherever they could, including weddings, street corners, fairs, Events, and Quinceañeras. At some places, the band began to gain a lot of appreciation, while at other performances, where Mexican Americans were not accepted, it was booed. On one occasion while performing at a wedding, the band was booed and then food was thrown on stage.\n\nIn 1981, Corpus Christi, Texas-based Freddie Records signed Selena y Los Dinos to a recording contract. By 1981, the label began promoting the yet-to-be released debut album by selling singles from tracks off the album in local stores. Selena y Los Dinos began to perform more frequently in local Texas clubs and fairs as their name began to spread around Texas. In 1984, Freddie released the band's very first full-length album entitled \"Selena y Los Dinos - Mis Primeras Grabaciones\". When the album was completed, the president and owner of Freddie Records told Abraham that his band, Selena y Los Dinos, were not professionally ready to record and release a full-length album. Undeterred, Abraham dropped the record deal with Freddie Records and walked out. While still under the record deal, Selena's father came upon another small local Texas record company called \"Cara Records.\" The rumored album \"The New Girl in Town\" was never sold in stores, but singles from Cara Records were sold separately and promotionally around the state of Texas. In 1987, \"GP Productions,\" which discovered Selena y Los Dinos performing, signed the group for a yearly record contract. Selena y Los Dinos were in the recording studio soon after the agreement. That same year, Selena y Los Dinos recorded their second full-length album \"Alpha\" (A in the Greek alphabet), which was the first album to be released without legal actions or threats.\n\nIn 1987, \"Munequito De Trapo\" (Rag Doll) was released and an increase in sales began to spread the news about the band, which was promoted and showcased in the \"Tejano Music Awards\". Selena won best \"Female Vocalist of The Year\", which she then won eight consecutive times. The band as well received and won awards separately. In 1987, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who was proud of the band's winnings and awards, released \"And the Winner Is...\" and made Selena sing more Tejano and Mexican songs which followed their roots in order to gain more recognition in the Tejano world. In 1988, Selena y Los Dinos released \"Preciosa\" (Precious), a nickname that was given to Selena as a child, which sold 20,000 units in Texas alone. No other record or single sales were ever documented outside the U.S. By 1988, Selena's albums began to sell 20,000 units apiece. Selena y Los Dinos' last independent studio album was released in 1988 under the title \"Dulce Amor\" (Sweet Love). The album helped Selena to be noticed during the 1989 Tejano Music Awards by José Behar, who had just opened the Latin division of EMI Records; EMI Latin. Jose Behar recalled seeing Selena perform and the whole place \"blew up\" from so much excitement and enthusiasm emanating from the charismatic Selena. Soon after her performance, Behar signed Selena as a solo artist. Selena began releasing her albums with her new logo titled after her name, while the band Los Dinos was still beside Selena in concerts.\n\nSelena's brother A.B. met Chris Pérez in 1988 and they became friends. When one of the guitar players for the band would leave, Abraham Quintanilla Jr. would let out an open call for anyone in the state of Texas who was willing to participate with them and tour alongside the band. Pérez was interviewed and performed for one of the open calls at Abraham Quintanilla's house. A.B., who had told Chris to come, was confronted by his father, who did not like the energy and image of Chris Pérez, who had his own Rock band and performed entirely in the English language. A.B. insisted that Pérez would learn the music quickly, convincing him to hire Pérez as the new lead guitarist. Pérez's addition to the band proved to be more than anticipated. He and Selena fell in love, but her father, who wanted to keep the band's clean-cut image, only saw envy in Pérez. He confronted Pérez and Selena and told them that the relationship had to end or the band would break up. Pérez quit, while Selena stayed with the band. However, they were secretly married on April 2, 1992, and Selena added Perez's last name to hers. She tried to hide the marriage from the rest of the family, but the news quickly spread to radio stations and newscasts. The senior Quintanilla later accepted Pérez into the family and allowed him to re-join the band. Soon after Selena's murder, Pérez left to form the Chris Pérez Band. He dedicated a song to his late wife, calling it \"The Best I Can\". The band broke up in 2002, and he joined with Selena's brother A.B. in the Kumbia Kings, 2006, Kumbia All Starz A.B. is now honoring Selena by using her name in his songs.\n\nThe surviving band members reunited for a historic massive tribute concert in honor of Selena on April 7, 2005. The concert, Selena ¡VIVE!, was held at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas.The event not only sold out, but it became the highest-rated and most viewed Spanish-language TV special ever. In attendance were Gloria Estefan, Kumbia Kings, and an introduction by Jennifer Lopez, who portrayed Selena in the film made about her life. Suzette Quintanilla, Selena's sister, the former drum player for Selena y Los Dinos, announced that the band Los Dinos were reuniting to record a new song for A.B. Quintanilla's group Kumbia All Starz with surprise guest recording artists on the album \"La Vida De Un Genio\".\n\nDonald Burnard “Don” Shelton, II, who was one of the backing vocals singers for Selena, died on December 2, 2014, from cancer at the age of 47 and was buried at Rose Hill Memorial Park in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\n\nSelena y Los Dinos albums\n\nSelena solo albums\n\n"}

{"id": "2296583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296583", "title": "Henry Robertson Bowers", "text": "Henry Robertson Bowers\n\nHenry Robertson Bowers (29 July 1883 – c. 29 March 1912) was one of Robert Falcon Scott's polar party on the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition of 1910–1913, all of whom died during their return from the South Pole.\n\nBowers was born on 29 July 1883 in Greenock, of Scottish descent. After his father died in Rangoon, his mother alone raised him from the age of three with his two older sisters. By January 1896, the family had moved to Streatham, in South London, and lived at 19 Pathfield Road, where Mrs Bowers was still residing in 1899. Whilst living in Streatham, Bowers attended Streatham High School for Boys in Pinfold Road in 1896-7. The building survives today as the Computer Centre behind Streatham Library, on which a plaque was placed by The Streatham Society on 29 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary of his death. \n\nHe went to sea first as a cadet in the merchant service, training on HMS \"Worcester\" and sailing around the world four times on the \"Loch Torridon\". He then enlisted in the Royal Indian Marine Service in 1905. He was appointed sub-lieutenant, serving in Ceylon and Burma, and commanded a river gunboat on the Irrawaddy. He later served on , preventing gun-running in the Persian Gulf.\n\nBowers joined Robert Falcon Scott's \"Terra Nova\" expedition in 1910, after having read the accounts of Scott's earlier \"Discovery\" expedition, and of Ernest Shackleton's expedition in . He had no previous polar experience, but was recommended to Scott by the ex-President of the Royal Geographical Society, Sir Clements Markham, who had been the main organiser of Scott's earlier Discovery expedition. Markham had met Bowers aboard HMS \"Worcester\" and had been so impressed with him that Scott invited Bowers to join the expedition without a prior interview. After Bowers fell 19 feet into a hold when loading the ship (someone had carelessly left the cover off), Scott was less impressed by the short, stout young man. \"Well, we're landed with him now, and must make the best of it,\" said Scott, but he soon changed his mind.\n\nOriginally appointed as a junior officer of the ship's party in charge of expedition stores, Bowers quickly distinguished himself as an extremely hard-working, highly skilled organiser. By the time the \"Terra Nova\" left New Zealand, Scott had promoted him to be a member of the shore party, in charge of landing, stores, navigation and the arrangement of sledging rations, a role in which his extraordinary powers of memory served Scott well.\n\nSix months after arriving in Antarctica, Bowers made the winter journey to the emperor penguin breeding grounds at Cape Crozier in July 1911 with Edward Adrian Wilson and Apsley Cherry-Garrard. The aim of the party was to secure an unhatched egg for scientific study. In almost total darkness and with temperatures ranging from , they man-hauled their sledge from Scott's base at Cape Evans to the far side of Ross Island. Frozen and exhausted, they reached their goal, only to be pinned down by a blizzard. Their tent was ripped away and carried off by the wind, leaving the men in their sleeping bags under a thickening drift of snow. When the winds subsided, by great fortune they found their tent lodged about half a mile away in rocks. Having successfully collected three eggs and desperately exhausted, they eventually arrived back at Cape Evans on 1 August 1911, five weeks after setting off. Cherry-Garrard later referred to this trip as \"The Worst Journey in the World\", which became the title of his book published in 1922 recounting the fate of the 1908–1912 expedition.\n\nOn 1 November 1911, the long trek to the South Pole began. Scott had not originally planned to include Bowers in his polar party. He had been a member of the sledge team led by Scott's second-in-command, Lieutenant Edward Evans and the last support party to accompany Scott and his team southward, but on 4 January 1912, just as Evans party was about to turn back, Bowers was assigned to the polar party. Some have argued that this seems to have been an impulsive decision by Scott, however, others, such as Antarctic explorer Ranulph Fiennes, have indicated that this was a logical decision – particularly when one intended to increase the speed of a polar land-crossing, in an effort to reduce the consumption of resources.\n\nOnly a few days earlier, he had ordered Evans' men to depot their skis, so that Bowers had to travel on foot to the pole while the others were still on skis. In addition, adding a fifth man to the party meant squeezing another person into a tent made for four, and having to split up rations that were packed in units for four men. The most likely motivation for Scott to add Bowers to the polar party was a realisation that he needed another experienced navigator to confirm their position at the South Pole to avoid controversy, such as that surrounding the claims of Frederick Cook and Robert Peary at the North Pole, although why he did not substitute Bowers for another member of the party—most likely Oates—is not clear. To back this theory up, it was Bowers who eventually took the sights to fix the exact location of the geographic South Pole for the Polar party. It was also Bowers who was in charge of the expedition's remaining camera and took most of the famous photographs at the South Pole and at Amundsen's tent.\n\nOn 16 January 1912, as Scott's party neared the Pole, it was Bowers who first spotted a black flag left at a camp made by Roald Amundsen's polar party over a month previously. They knew then that they had been beaten in the race to be first to the South Pole. On 18 January, they arrived at the South Pole to find a tent left behind by Amundsen's party at their Polheim camp; inside, a dated note informed them that Amundsen had reached the Pole on 14 December 1911, beating Scott's party by 35 days. \n\nDuring the return journey, they first made good progress, but P.O. Edgar Evans died on 17 February, presumably of a brain injury after a fall. At the end of February, temperatures fell sharply, the dog relief team failed to show up at the prearranged meeting point on 1 March, and Oates' foot became frostbitten and gangrenous, slowing the party down; in a vain attempt to save his companions, he deliberately walked out of their tent to his death on 16 March. Scott, Bowers, and Wilson continued on for three more days, progressing more, but were stopped short of the next food depot by a blizzard on 20 March. The blizzard continued for days, longer than they had fuel and food for. Too weak, cold and hungry to continue, they died in their tent on or soon after 29 March—Scott's last diary entry— from their base camp. \n\nTheir bodies were found by a search party the following spring on 12 November 1912. The search party collapsed the tent over them, thus burying them where they lay under a snow cairn topped by a cross made from a pair of skis. Among the items they found and took back with them were the Kodak film rolls with the photographs at the South Pole and geological specimens which later proved the Gondwana theory.\n\nThe Bowers Hills in Antarctica, later renamed the Bowers Mountains, were named in his honour.\n\nBowers was short, at five foot four inches. He had red hair and a distinctive beak-like nose that quickly earned him the nickname of \"Birdie\" among his fellow explorers. He was known for his toughness, dependability, and cheerfulness. Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a fellow expedition member, remarked that his \"capacity for work was prodigious\", and that \"There was nothing subtle about him. He was transparently simple, straightforward, and unselfish\". In his diary, Scott wrote of Bowers that \"he is the hardest traveller that ever undertook a Polar journey as well as one of the most undaunted\". In a letter to Bowers' mother retrieved from the tent containing their bodies, Scott wrote \"I write when we are very near the end of our journey, and I am finishing it in company with two gallant, noble gentlemen. One of these is your son. He had come to be one of my closest and soundest friends, and I appreciate his wonderful upright nature, his ability and energy. As the troubles have thickened his dauntless spirit ever shone brighter and he has remained cheerful, hopeful, and indomitable to the end.\"\n\nBowers' life is celebrated with a small display at Rothesay Museum on the Isle of Bute, near where his mother and sister went to live; he visited them during shore leave and loved walking in the Scottish Highlands. Copies of the photographs Bowers took on the last stages of the South Pole journey were widely exhibited during the centenary of the South Pole expedition and are held at the Scott Polar Research Institute and other archives.\n\n"}

Joe)\n\nStorm Shadow is a fictional character from the toyline, comic books and animated series. He is best known as the Cobra Commander's ninja bodyguard, and for his history with fellow ninja Snake Eyes. Throughout their history, he has changed sides several times; conflicted in loyalties between Cobra, G.I. Joe, and his blood brother, Snake Eyes. Storm Shadow is one of the most prominent characters in the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero franchise, and has appeared in every series since its inception. He is portrayed by Lee Byung-hun in the 2009 live-action film \"\", and the 2013 sequel \"\". Andrew Koji will portray Storm Shadow in the upcoming 2020 spin-off film, \"Snake Eyes\".\n\nIn his original \"A Real American Hero\" incarnation, Storm Shadow's real name is Thomas S. Arashikage (トーマス・嵐影) (\"Arashi\" meaning \"Storm\" and \"kage\" meaning \"shadow\" in Japanese), a Japanese American. Storm Shadow served in the U.S. Army special operations group along with Snake Eyes, and later invited him to train as a ninja with his family in Japan. The duo have been everything to one another from the bitterest of enemies, to the most loyal of friends, who would fight and die for one another.\n\nStorm Shadow can trace his family history through thirty generations of assassins. He is an 8th degree black belt in several martial arts, and can endure unimaginable amounts of hardship and pain. Storm Shadow moves with blinding speed, can scale sheer walls with bare hands and feet, and is an expert with a long bow, katana, throwing stars and nunchaku sticks. He usually wears a white uniform and mask. When out of his uniform, he is shown to be Japanese, with black hair and dark eyes.\n\nIn 2007, the character's creator, Larry Hama, revealed an alternate name for the character, Tomisaburo Arashikage (嵐影富三郎), in the solo series \"Storm Shadow\". His tattoo is a hexagram of the I Ching named 既濟 (jì jì), or \"Already Fording\".\n\nStorm Shadow was only listed with a rank while a member of the Joe team. There are four instances where his file card provides a pay-grade: 1991, 1994, and 1997 releases all have him listed as a Master Sergeant or E-8 (the same rank as Duke), and in 2007, the 25th anniversary release the file card lists him as E-5.\n\nStorm Shadow is one of the few characters from the \"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\" line that has been released as both a member of Cobra and a member of G.I. Joe. He first appeared in 1984 as a member of Cobra, but with his second figure released in 1988, he had defected to being a member of G.I. Joe. A new version of Storm Shadow was released as part of the Ninja Force line in 1992. The figure was repainted and released as part of the \"Shadow Ninjas\" line in 1994.\n\nHis loyalties remained with G.I. Joe until in 2000 his figure was released again as a Cobra agent. Since then, he has remained a member of Cobra. He is most often paired with his sword brother, Snake Eyes, in multi or comic packs. He has been released two times unmasked as Tommy Arashikage (once as a mail-away figure and once in a comic pack).\n\nThe year 2007 was the 25th anniversary of the launch of \"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\", the third major reinvention of the G.I. Joe brand since 1964. To celebrate, Hasbro created two boxed sets of brand new figures, featuring modern sculpts with updated articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe's trademark O-ring construction). Storm Shadow contained some new, more intricate details that the original character didn't have. He was included in the Cobra set, along with Cobra Commander, Destro, Baroness, and a Cobra Trooper. He was also included in a two-pack consisting of Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes in their original costumes, and a reissued \"G.I. Joe\" #21 comic book, Storm Shadow's first appearance in the series. He was also included in the first wave of single pack figures in his 1988 G.I. Joe urban-camouflage ninja uniform, but still contained slight differences from the 1988 character outfit, since Hasbro decided to reuse most of the tooling of the first figure; hence, he didn't have long sleeves, the placement of his arm tattoo had been moved, and he was missing the recurve bow and the calves garments (the latter of which were actually included on a Cobra-aligned figure featured in a comic pack with Firefly, along with a black backpack based on the 1988 figure's red backpack). A modified version of his 2007 figure appeared in the 2009 Hall of Heroes sub-line, as well as a new Cobra box set, featuring the sleeveless version of his original outfit as it appeared in the original comics and cartoons.\n\nAs a featured character in the live-action movie franchise, Storm Shadow received several figures in the respective movie-based toy lines based on his appearances in the films. In addition, as part of the \"\" toyline in 2013, he received an \"Ultimate\" edition figure based on his original Cobra costume (without sleeves), featuring an additional unmasked head and numerous accessories, including a jet pack with colors and markings based on the Cobra C.L.A.W. jet glider. A budget-line figure exclusive to discount retailers was released in 2012, based on his Ninja Force costume. As part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the \"G.I. Joe\" franchise, Storm Shadow received one more release based upon his G.I. Joe urban camo outfit (although his file card and figure stand aligned him with Cobra) in a two-pack with Spirit Iron-Knife in 2015. This figure more accurately replicated the 1988 figure than the 2007 release, and used the backpack and swords from the Firefly comic-pack release, with the backpack colored red like the 1988 toy.\n\nStorm Shadow first appeared in Marvel's \"\" #21 (March 1984), and was created by Larry Hama. Storm Shadow served in Southeast Asia on the same Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol team as future Joes Stalker and Snake Eyes. The intense nature of this service together forged a strong friendship between him and Snake Eyes. After Vietnam, Storm Shadow visited his family in Japan. His family, the Arashikage Clan, had actually been a fierce ninja clan, but for many centuries had remained clandestine. Hoping to learn the ways of the ninja, Storm Shadow studied under the tutelage of his estranged uncle, the Hard Master. When Snake Eyes arrived in Japan following the death of his entire family in a horrific automobile crash, he was invited to study with the clan. He quickly began to surpass Storm Shadow's abilities and was the Hard Master's choice to succeed him as the head of the clan. This caused a rift between the two friends, and Snake Eyes decided that he would leave the clan. However, before he could, an assassin (who would later be revealed as Zartan) killed Storm Shadow's uncle while he was demonstrating a ninja technique. Storm Shadow, seeing the assassin fleeing in a Cobra helicopter, left the clan to follow the assassin. Due to his abrupt disappearance and the fact that the killer appeared to use a technique that Storm Shadow was a master of, Snake Eyes, the Soft Master, and the remaining clan members thought that Storm Shadow was to blame for the murder. Storm Shadow blamed Snake Eyes for the murder, as the Hard Master was using a ninja technique to imitate Snake Eyes, thus fooling Zartan into shooting the wrong target.\n\nYears passed and Storm Shadow eventually was led to the international terrorist organization Cobra. He was quickly made Cobra Commander's bodyguard and soon thereafter encountered his old friends, Stalker and Snake Eyes, as members of the American strike team, G.I. Joe, designed to destroy Cobra. Storm Shadow befriends the son of Cobra Commander, a teenager named Billy. Eventually the two escape together. After several battles with the Joes, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes would work together to bring down the men responsible for the death of the Hard Master (Zartan, Cobra Commander, and Firefly). During their first attempt, while trying to flee Cobra Island, Storm Shadow was shot by the Baroness and believed to be dead. He was revived during Doctor Mindbender's creation of Serpentor. Finally, Storm Shadow was made an official member of the G.I. Joe team and regained his honor through countless acts of courage. He would later return to Cobra after being captured and brainwashed along with several other former Cobra agents. He was frequently given continuous sessions of brainwashing to ensure his loyalty, and it took him a few years to finally shake off the programming and rejoin his sword brother, Snake Eyes. Storm Shadow participates in training the Joe's official Ninja Force. He relates to the students how he was unable to master a specific skill until he attempted to teach it; this allowed him to view the skill from different angles and ultimately master it. In the next issue, Storm Shadow and the Ninja Force encounter an attack from the Cobra allied mercenary force called the 'Night Creepers'.\n\nWhen the G.I. Joe team is reactivated in Devil's Due Publishing's \"\", Storm Shadow is added to the team due to his expertise as a covert ops specialist and ninja. However, what proves more important to the team, is the knowledge he gained as Cobra Commander's bodyguard. While Snake Eyes and Stalker accept him as a member, fellow team member Shipwreck is the most vocal about his suspicions, considering the ninja's constantly changing loyalties. Storm Shadow is the first to learn of the Baroness being alive and being held in the basement of the new G.I. Joe command center, \"The Rock\". After Snake Eyes' death aboard Destro's sub, Storm Shadow assists the team in search of the body, and encounters Major Bludd in Australia. He finds the Red Ninja clan had raised Snake Eyes from the dead, and had used some of their ancient techniques to place Sei-Ten in the body of T'jbang. After stopping Snake Eyes by placing Scarlett's life in danger, Storm Shadow temporarily leaves the team to assist the Red Ninjas in rebuilding and reviving their leader to set things right. Storm Shadow returns to stop Cobra from liberating prisoners from the G.I. Joe prison facility \"The Coffin\", assisted by a mole within Cobra. He is partially successful, but Tomax manages to free Major Bludd and several others, while killing those Cobra Commander considered \"loose ends\". Storm Shadow then tracks down Destro and the Baroness, so that they can help disable Cobra's M.A.R.S. tech devices. They join the rest of the main team, in defeating several Cobra cells, and disarming nuclear weapons that Cobra Commander has placed in the Amazon and Antarctica.\n\nThe seven-issue solo series \"Storm Shadow\", written by the original writer Larry Hama, follows Storm Shadow after leaving the G.I. Joe team.\n\nIn the alternate continuity series \"G.I. Joe Reloaded\", Storm Shadow is similar to his original continuity counterpart in his Cobra roots, as he serves as Cobra Commander's assassin/bodyguard. He does not wear a mask, and instead, is seen wearing a much different white uniform with a long jacket. He does face off with Snake Eyes, who in this series is his half-brother, and comments on Snake Eyes' traitorous nature. This series ended without fully exploring their relationship.\n\nUnlike the comic, the never explored the relationship between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. He was often being bandied about as a counterpart to G.I. Joe member Spirit, and later on against G.I. Joe member Quick Kick. Also, he remained loyal to Cobra until the end of the Sunbow series. He was featured in the episode \"Excalibur\", where he finds King Arthur's sword. During Season 2, he sided with Cobra Commander against Serpentor, and was seen helping the Commander in his various plots to overthrow Serpentor.\n\nIn \"\", Storm Shadow is seen in two frames when Serpentor yells at all the Cobra characters in the beginning.\n\nStorm Shadow returns in the , but this time on the side of the Joe team and as a member of the Ninja Force, reflecting his status in both the toy-line and the comics at that time. He came to side with the Joes because the initial cartoon's storyline ended after \"\" and so the comic dictated the path of the toys. Had the series continued with a third season, Storm Shadow would still have been a Cobra. Cobra Commander makes several comments in the episode \"Shadow of a Doubt\" about Storm Shadow being a traitor. Storm Shadow claims that he only joined Cobra to find out who had dishonored his ninja clan. Aside from that, he is given little backstory in the animated series. The relationship between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow is best showcased in the Season 2 episode, \"The Sword\", when it is shown that they both respect each other's ninja skills and abilities. Storm Shadow was voiced by Scott McNeil.\n\nStorm Shadow appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movies \"\" and \"\", voiced by Ty Olsson. These two movies seem to ignore the previous continuity, and deal more with the continuity of the toys and cartoon at that time. Storm Shadow is again a Cobra ninja as in previous Sunbow cartoons; however, unlike previous times, he now faces Snake Eyes.\n\nIn the animated short \"\", a new ninja Tiger Claw is joining G.I. Joe, and learns of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow's past in the Arashikage clan. The rivalry between the two ninjas is explained to some degree, and it shows how they have dealt with each other to this day. Most of the movie is narration over original artwork, and some scenes from the previous movies, as well as some new footage at the end.\n\nIn the \"\" miniseries, Storm Shadow's past is revealed as his rivalry with Snake Eyes being the result of Storm Shadow fearing his uncle would teach the seventh move of the \"Seven Steps to the Sun\" to Snake Eyes instead of him because of his bloodlust, and then hiring Zartan to take out their master. By present time, during the attack of the U.S.S. Flagg, Storm Shadow murders Bazooka and places a scroll marked with the Arashikage symbol that issues to Snake Eyes a final duel at their former dojo. Revealing his true reasons for hating Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow pins him down using the sixth move. However, Snake Eyes's counters reveal he, in fact, had learned the final move from their master prior to his death, using it to kill Storm Shadow. However, in the DVD release of the film, the grave that Snake Eyes buried Storm Shadow in is shown to be empty and Storm Shadow is presumably still alive. Storm Shadow was voiced by Eric Bauza.\n\nIn the animated series \"\", Storm Shadow is voiced by Andrew Kishino. Born Tomisaburo Arashikage, he is the cousin of Kimi Arashikage (Jinx) and nephew of the Hard Master, head of the Arashikage clan of ninja. He once trained with Snake Eyes and has had a bitter rivalry with him. The rivalry reached its zenith when Tomisaburo slipped poison in the tea cup meant for Snake Eyes as he was to talk to the Hard Master. However, without the youth's knowledge, the cups were accidentally switched and the Hard Master drank the poisoned tea. Mistaking Snake Eyes' attempt to save his uncle (via an emergency tracheotomy) as an act of cold-blooded murder, scarring him while driving him off, Tomisaburo vowed revenge while becoming acting leader of the Arashikage. Storm Shadow pursued Snake Eyes to his hidden dojo in the mountains, telling Kimi of how her father died and convincing her to reclaim her birthright. During the events of \"Homecoming\", Storm Shadow fought Snake Eyes on board a military train and assisted the Baroness, later infiltrating Cobra Industries and proposes an allegiance with her. Later, in \"White Out,\" Storm Shadow receives the Shadow Vipers from Doctor Mindbender and pursues the Joes to Canada, where he barely managed to survive being caught in an avalanche. In \"Cutting Edge,\" Baroness calls on Storm Shadow when a high-tech ninja is targeting Cobra Commander. Storm Shadow ends up discovering that the assassin to be Jinx, who revealed (as explained to her by Scarlett) that Snake Eyes's action against the Hard Master was actually an attempt to save him from the poison inflicting him. Hearing it, Storm Shadow leaves and later returns to help Jinx and Snake Eyes destroy a cadre of B.A.T.s. Once the fight resolved, Storm Shadow admitted to his murder attempt on Snake Eyes and how the Hard Master died as a result. Believing himself to be beyond redemption for unknowingly killing the Hard Master, Storm Shadow takes his leave.\n\nIn \"\", Storm Shadow is Cobra's ninja master. He began his career in mainstream U.S. intelligence groups. Early on he went undercover into the Cobra organization and was brainwashed by the enemy. With powerful mind tricks, they convinced him that the groups he worked for were really traitors, and that Cobra forces were the good guys trying to stop them. He is a powerful ninja who has adapted his martial arts skills to suit his own evil purposes. A covert ops counterintelligence expert, he once performed undercover sabotage operations. Now as a member of Cobra, he uses this knowledge against the Sigma 6 team, always working to destroy them and anyone else who gets in his way.\n\nIn the animated series, Storm Shadow is voiced by Tom Wayland. The rivalry between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes is one of the focal plot lines of the series. There have been hints and references as to the cause of their enmity. The 4Kids TV website for \"Sigma 6\" states that Storm Shadow was on an infiltration mission in a Cobra base and was captured and brainwashed into thinking the Joes and Snake Eyes were his enemies. Although Storm Shadow called Snake Eyes \"brother,\" the exact nature of that relationship is unknown. Storm Shadow frequently blames Snake Eyes for the downfall of the Arashikage ninja clan. The exact nature of Snake Eyes's betrayal of the Arashikage is as yet unknown. On occasion, he used ninja B.A.T.s as support troopers. This is in contrast to the \"A Real American Hero\" series, wherein Storm Shadow preferred highly trained humans as opposed to machines.\n\nDevil's Due also created a miniseries based on Sigma 6. It follows the style and the content of the animated series, spotlighting a different member of Sigma 6 and Cobra in each issue.\n\nIn the 2009 film, \"\", the young Storm Shadow is played by Brandon Soo Hoo and the adult by Lee Byung-Hun. In this film adaptation, Storm Shadow is portrayed as a Korean ninja who was trained in Japan. The young Storm Shadow is seen speaking in Korean while training in Tokyo.\n\nStorm Shadow has a long history with Snake Eyes going back to when they were children, when he caught a starving Snake Eyes attempting to steal food. However, much to Storm Shadow's chagrin, Snake Eyes is immediately welcomed into the dojo. While Storm Shadow is initially superior, Snake Eyes persists and eventually earns the favor of the Hard Master. Shortly after, Snake Eyes is proclaimed the best student, and it is made to appear that Storm Shadow murdered the master and fled the scene. This turns their rivalry into bitter hatred as they find themselves on opposing sides. Similar to his continuity counterparts in background and attire, Storm Shadow serves as McCullen's assassin and as both bodyguard and mentor to the Baroness. Sent by McCullen to support the Baroness in acquiring the nanomite warheads, Storm Shadow was also given a direct order to kill Baron Daniel DeCobray if he ever touched the Baroness again, with her intentionally giving him reason as DeCobray outlived his usefulness to them. In another instance, however, Zartan mocks Storm Shadow for his unwillingness to kill women. During a lengthy fight in Cobra's arctic base, Snake Eyes slashes Storm Shadow several times, eventually compelling the latter to remove his white uniform. At the end, he is stabbed by Snake Eyes and falls into icy water.\n\nIn \"Operation HISS\", a comic sequel to the film, Storm Shadow survived his apparent death in the film. Lee Byung-hun has stated in an interview that he is signed on to return to future sequels, and has returned in the film \"\". In a Storm Shadow featurette for \"G.I. Joe: Retaliation\", it is learned that he was framed for the murder of the Hard Master by Zartan, who proceeded to raise Storm Shadow to be a ruthless assassin. Eventually Storm Shadow betrays Cobra and takes his revenge on his former master.\n\nStorm Shadow will appear in the upcoming \"Snake Eyes\" with Andrew Koji portraying the character.\n\nStorm Shadow is one of the featured villains in the 1985 game \"\". Storm Shadow is featured as a playable character in the 1992 game \"\". In the 2009 game \"\", he is a mini-boss, who is fought once in each of the first three acts.\n\nTopless Robot ranked Storm Shadow as second on the 2010 list of The 10 Coolest G.I. Joe Ninjas, adding that he \"been voted the #1 Cobra villain by the old Action Force Weekly\". His likeness is also featured in \"League of Legends\", where the yordle ninja character named Kennen can be given the Arctic Ops skin, displaying the camo pattern worn by the 1988 Storm Shadow, as well as the character Zed who has a skin that appears similar to his appearance. \n\n"}

Written as Smith's last novel in 1965 and published shortly before his death, it expands on the characterizations of the earlier novels (written 1919 - about 1938) with some discrepancies (some of which may relate to unwritten background developments). Marc DuQuesne, the major villain of the three previous novels, is shown to have matured, reformed, and offered a chance at what amounted at pardon for his prior crimes against the heroes.\n\nThe book ends with Dick Seaton and DuQuesne teaming up to perpetrate a galaxy-wide genocide against the Chlorans, causing all their suns to go nova. This act is condoned with the argument that otherwise the Chlorans would have eventually broken out of their galaxy and taken over the entire universe; Seaton compares the Chlorans to a cancer which must be destroyed \"to the last cell\". The Chlorans themselves, though depicted earlier in the book as extremely cruel, were not bent on exterminating humans but only enslaving and exploiting them.\n\n\"Skylark DuQuesne\" was first serialized in \"IF Worlds of Science Fiction\" beginning in June 1965 before being published in 1966 by Pyramid Books.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\nThe former Murdock School building is located in the town center of Winchendon, on flanking the west side of Monument Park, west of the commercial downtown area. It is 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick and covered by a slate roof. It is richly detailed in the Romanesque style, with a gabled pavilion projecting from its front facade. Prominent features of the projecting section are a tall square tower at the right side, with a pyramidal roof topped by a copper finial and cross. The left side of the projection has a less tall chimney adorned with brick corbelling and covered by a copper cap. The main entrance is in the center of the projection, recessed under a wide round arch.\n\nThe school was built in 1887 with funds donated by Captain Ephraim Murdock, Jr., whose father had previously donated the Winchendon Academy building to the town, and was a friend of educator Horace Mann.

He developed a valuable system of intubation in diphtheria cases. O'Dwyer is often cited as the \"father of laryngeal intubation in croup\".\n\nJoseph P. O'Dwyer was born on October 12, 1841 in Cleveland, Ohio, and was educated in London, Ontario. After two years of apprenticeship in the office of one Dr. Anderson, he entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York from which he was graduated in 1865. He won first place in the competitive examination for resident physicians of New York's Charity Hospital, on Blackwell's Island. The island housed a penitentiary, women's asylum, and other facilities for the criminal, the insane, and the destitute. Opened in 1860, City Hospital was renamed Charity Hospital in 1870, and was among New York City's largest institutions for the treatment of illnesses among the poor. O'Dwyer was in charge of the medical service during a cholera epidemic. During his service, a typhus epidemic also broke out. O'Dwyer contracted typhus, but made a full recovery. After the completion of his service, in 1868 he set up in private practice on Second Avenue near Fifty-fifth St. Four years later (1872), he moved to Lexington Avenue near Sixty-sixth St. and began his long association with the New York Foundling Asylum.\n\nIn the 1800s diphtheria was a devastating disease, especially lethal in children. The cause of death was usually asphyxia due to an obstructed airway.\n\nA tracheotomy was often a necessary procedure to save a patient suffering with diphtheria from suffocation. This was, at that time, a high-risk procedure, even post-operative. In 1858, Paris pediatrician Eugene Bouchut devised a method to bypass the diphtheria pseudomembrane obstructing the larynx without resorting to a tracheotomy. However, Bouchut's proposal was not well received, due in part to the opposition of Armand Trousseau, the known authority on tracheotomies.\n\nThe use of tracheotomy had fallen into disrepute at the Foundling Hospital with a record 100% death rate, among children due to suffocation when diphtheria brought about closure of the larynx. O'Dwyer and his colleague at the Foundling Hospital, W.P.Northrup, experimented with various approaches to keep the laryngeal airway open. At first, O'Dwyer experimented with his device on cadavers.\nThe use of a tube for intubation had often been attempted but unsuccessfully. After five years of study, working with surgeon George Fell, by 1885 O'Dwyer had devised a set of tubes of graduating in size to fit children from one to ten years of age. He also developed a procedure for the insertion and extraction of the tube, using specially designed instruments. After a number of refinements the final tubes, made by George Tiemann and Company of New York, were made of brass, lined with gold, and came in five different sizes. These were later supplanted by Annandale's rubber endotracheal tube. The method proved successful in relieving difficulty in breathing. In 1885, O'Dwyer presented his findings. According to Sperati and Felisanti, O'Dwyer's modifications in Bouchut's concept \"were determinant\". O'Dwyer's tubes of hard rubber or metal had rounded edges and were therefore, well tolerated.\n\nThe O'Dwyer Method was first published in the N. Y. Medical Journal in 1888, as \"Intubation of the Larynx\". O'Dwyer's design was supported by Abraham Jacobi, the leading pediatrician at that time. O’Dwyer’s tubes and method was quickly adopted by American physicians and became the first widely used endotracheal technique. Before his death it was universally acknowledged that he had made the most important practical discovery of his generation. Use of O'Dwyer's intubation tubes required considerable practice. O'Dwyer wrote and spoke extensively to educate his fellow practitioners. His tubes and the accompanying instruments for intubation and extubation, with his methods for the care of these patients, came to be employed throughout the medical world, gradually reducing the use of tracheotomy for croup, and thereby \"leading to a significant reduction in the death rate\".\n\nBouchut and O'Dwyer met in Berlin in 1890 at the X International Congress of Medicine which focused on laryngeal intubation, and where both acknowledged the other's contribution to the development of the procedure. Afterwards O'Dwyer devoted himself to the study of pneumonia. In 1896 he served as president of the American Pediatric Society. He was also active at Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nThe O'Dwyer method replaced tracheotomy until around 1895 when the development of antitoxins for diphtheria became more common. When the development of antitoxins reduced the need for intubations, O'Dwyer was among the early practitioners to switch from intubation where appropriate.\n\nW.P. Northrup wrote, \"Intubation is O'Dwyer's monument. It is equally true that it killed him.\" By this Northrup refers to the fact that others rushed to adopt the still developing technique, resulting in a variety of negative results due in large part to their own inexperience. Correspondence from these untrained practitioners caused O'Dwyer a great deal of stress. \"All the unhappy results all tales of misadventure, and all the unfavorable criticisms came directly to him.\" Still grieving his late wife, O'Dwyer worried much and slept little.\n\nIn December 1897 he developed symptoms of a diphtheria-related myocardiopathy, likely contracted while treating a young patient. He died on January 7, 1898. Known for his charities, Dr. O'Dwyer had declined to patent his invention, thereby sacrificing large pecuniary gains. O'Dwyer did not make much money from the development of his intubation method and according to his friend Northrup, \"died poor\". The trustees of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons established the O'Dwyer Scholarship to provide for the education of his son and namesake, which then was allowed to lapse upon Joseph Jr.'s graduation. Family friends arranged for the education of his three other sons.\n\nHis work at the Foundling Hospital helped greatly to make that institution one of the best of its kind. In private practice, O'Dwyer attended over 3,000 confinements, many of them in poor neighborhoods.\nO'Dwyer introduced the use of tubes in children with diphtheritic pseudomembranes in the larynx, to substantially increase their survival chances at a time when tracheotomy still had a high failure rate. The tubes proved of great value in stenosis of the larynx due to various other diseases and to strictures of the larynx, especially consequent on burns or scalds. Subsequent modifications further enhanced its application. The Fell-O'Dwyer apparatus supplied practical instrumentation for intermittent positive pressure ventilation. The Fell-O'Dwyer Apparatus was widely used in cases of asphyxia, even in those caused by overdosage of anaesthetics. Some of his pioneering work anticipated methods of intensive care medicine.\n\n\n"}

Said \"Trouser Press\", \"As the band that poured the first shot in the Cocktail Revolution, this Boston-area combo brought lounge music into the '90s—or, more accurately, transported tastemakers back to the suburbia of the '50s—with strikingly authentic interpretations of some of the most unauthentic sounds known to mankind\".\n\nThe band ended in 1999.\n\nConnecticut natives Liz Cox (drums, vocals) and Michael Cudahy (guitar, vocals) formed indie rock band Christmas in Boston in 1983. They issued three albums, \"In Excelsior Dayglo\" (1986), \"Ultra Prophets of Thee Psykick Revolution\" (1989) and \"Vortex\" (posthumously released in 1993). Cudahy's brother Nick was a member of the Christmas lineup for the second album.\n\nIn 1991, Michael Cudahy — now re-dubbed \"The Millionaire\" by fellow Providence \"bon vivant\" Robert Jaz — wrote a stage show titled \"The Tiki Wonder Hour\", and formed the 14-piece \"Combustible Edison 'Heliotropic Oriental Mambo and Foxtrot Orchestra\"' to accompany the performance. After three performances of \"Tiki Wonder Hour,\" the orchestra shortened its name to Combustible Edison and slimmed down to five core members: Cox (renamed \"Miss Lily Banquette\", on vocals and various percussion instruments), The Millionaire (guitar), Nick Cudahy (bass), Mr. Peter Dixon (keyboards) and Aaron Oppenheimer (drums and percussion).\n\nCombustible Edison signed to Sub Pop Records and released their debut album, \"I, Swinger\", in 1994. A live review by \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Chuck Crisafulli noted that the album \"perfectly duplicates the '50s cool and hi-fi exotica of such lounge icons as Martin Denny\", while \"Trouser Press\" said, \"\"I, Swinger\" is a faithful replication of bargain-bin exotica, right down to a sleeve festooned with cocktail recipes and calculatedly dated hep-cat liner notes\". The group performed on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" on December 23, 1994.\n\nAround this time the band relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nIn 1995, the band recorded the soundtrack to the film \"Four Rooms\", produced by Mark Mothersbaugh. \"Vertigogo\", the film's main theme, was submitted for consideration for an Academy Award, but was ultimately disqualified from consideration because of its incomprehensible lyrical content, despite the fact that the band submitted a lyric sheet with their best written approximation of the lyrics.\n\nThe group's second studio album, \"Schizophonic!\" was issued in 1996.

The film is a dark comedy that explores office culture and its effects and often uses surrealism to achieve its thematic goals.\n\nThe film is set in Calgary, Alberta, where many downtown buildings are connected by the Plus 15, an extensive network of indoor skywalks. Because of this network, the hustle and bustle of the traditional \"main street\" has been replaced by recirculated air, food courts, and fluorescent lights. The result is a bleak and often humorous dark comedy about Canadian corporate culture.\n\nThe film centres on a group of office colleagues in downtown Calgary, Alberta, who bet a month's salary on who can last the longest without going outside by using the system of covered walkways that connect the buildings. The film takes place over one lunch hour on day 28 of the month-long competition. Things start to become complicated as the office prepares for the company founder's retirement party.\n\nThe film's title is derived from a particular form of suicide where one smashes the (non-openable) window of one's high-rise office and then jumps through. In the movie, one of the characters has accumulated a 2-litre pop bottle full of marbles in the hopes of breaking his window. The dark joke for this is referenced in the film as: \"a 15 bus takes you downtown, [but] a bottle of marbles takes you way downtown.\"\n\n\nThe majority of the film was shot in TD Square, the Calgary Eaton Centre, and Bankers Hall. The company's offices are situated in the TD Canada Trust Tower. The low-budget film was shot on digital and later transferred to 35 mm.\n\nThe film as of May 1, 2009, has a 70% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Most critics praise the satirical elements, casting, and plot. Others find the film to be humourless and incomplete, and the plot to be too nonsensical and uninteresting. The film was shown at the Calgary International Film Festival on September 19, 2019, to celebrate its 20th anniversary.\n\n\n"}

Later he also studied in Berlin and earned his Doctor of Laws in 1908, at the age of 28, in Erlangen, Bavaria. Afterwards, he became a bureaucrat for the national railroad, the Reichsbahn, in Strasbourg. Between 1915 and 1917 he participated in the First World War in an infantry regiment. Up to 1919 he was more active behind the front, first in Bucharest, Romania, then in Kiev, and finally as a German business agent for the Ukrainian government.\n\nThanks to his good contacts, in 1919 Meissner became \"Acting Advisor in the Bureau of the President\" (who at that time was the social democrat Friedrich Ebert), and by 1920 rose to the position of \"Ministerial Director and Head of the Bureau of the President.\" Ebert named Meissner to the post of State Secretary in 1923. He continued in that post under Ebert's successor Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nWhen Hitler fused the functions of Head of State (here, the President) and the Head of Government (the Chancellery) in 1934, Meissner's office was renamed the \"Presidential Chancellery\" and restricted in its responsibilities to representative and formal matters. In 1937, Meissner was appointed to the newly created position of \"State Minister of the Rank of a Federal Minister and Chief of the Presidential Chancellery of the Führer and Chancellor.\"\n\nAfter the Second World War, Meissner was arrested by the Allies and interrogated as a witness in the Nuremberg Trials. In July 1947, he appeared as a character witness for the accused former State Secretary Franz Schlegelberger. He was finally prosecuted himself in the Wilhelmstrasse Trial, but the court acquitted him on 14 April. Two years later, in May 1949, he was accused again, in Munich, and adjudged a fellow traveler. His appeal was turned down, but the proceedings were called to a halt in January 1952.\n\nIn 1950, Meissner published a memoir covering his unusual bureaucrat's career in a book entitled \"State Secretary under Ebert, Hindenburg and Hitler\". The writer Hans-Otto Meissner (1909–1992) was his son.\n\nMeissner, who lived with his family in the palace of the German President between 1929 and 1939, undoubtedly enjoyed major influence upon the presidents, especially Hindenburg. Together with Kurt von Schleicher and a few others, Meissner, in the years 1929 and 1930, furthered the dissolution of the parliamentary system by means of a civil presidential cabinet.\n\nHis role in the appointment of Hitler to Chancellor in the period of December 1932 until January 1933 remains a controversy among historians. As member of the \"camarilla\", Meissner was certainly no small influence as State Secretary, due to his close relations with president Paul von Hindenburg. Together with Oskar von Hindenburg and Franz von Papen, Meissner organized the negotiations with Hitler to depose von Schleicher and appoint Hitler to the post of Chancellor. For the Nazis' part, the talks were facilitated through Wilhelm Keppler, Joachim von Ribbentrop and the banker Kurt Freiherr von Schröder, a former officer and head of the old-guard conservative \"Herrenklub\" (Gentlemen's club) in Berlin, in which von Papen was also active. Neither Hitler nor Hindenburg, as of the end of 1932, would have initiated contact to one another, so great was their mutual distaste.\n\nMeissner submitted his resignation in 1933, but was turned down, whereupon he assumed responsibility primarily for delegational duties. In 1937, the Nazi regime raised him to the rank of Federal Minister, with the title, \"Chief of the Presidential Chancellery of the Führer and the Chancellor\". But politically, his influence in the Hitler regime was distinctly minor.\n\n\n\n"}

If the R′ is hydrogen, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Peresters have general structure RC(O)OOR. The O−O bond easily breaks, producing free radicals of the form RO (the dot represents an unpaired electron). Thus, organic peroxides are useful as initiators for some types of polymerisation, such as the epoxy resins used in glass-reinforced plastics. MEKP and benzoyl peroxide are commonly used for this purpose. However, the same property also means that organic peroxides can either intentionally or unintentionally initiate explosive polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and this process has been used in explosives. Organic peroxides, like their inorganic counterparts, are powerful bleaching agents.\n\nThe O−O bond length in peroxides is about 1.45 Å, and the R−O−O angles (R = H, C) are about 110° (water-like). Characteristically, the C−O−O−R (R = H, C) dihedral angles are about 120°. The O−O bond is relatively weak, with a bond dissociation energy of , less than half the strengths of C−C, C−H, and C−O bonds.\n\nMajor classes of organic peroxides include:\nThese compounds occur in nature or are useful in commercial settings. Still other more specialized peroxy compounds are known.\n\nPeroxides play important roles in biology. Hundreds of peroxides and hydroperoxides are known, being derived from fatty acids, steroids, and terpenes. Derived from fatty acids are a number of 1,2-dioxenes. The biosynthesis prostaglandins proceeds via an endoperoxide, a class of bicyclic peroxides.\nIn firefly, oxidation of luciferins, which is catalyzed by luciferases, yields a peroxy compound 1,2-dioxetane. The dioxetane is unstable and decays spontaneously to carbon dioxide and excited ketones, which release excess energy by emitting light (bioluminescence).\n\nDibenzoyl peroxide is used as a radical initiator and to assist polymerization of acrylates. Industrial resins based on acrylic and/or methacrylic acid esters are invariably produced by radical polymerization with organic peroxides at elevated temperatures. The polymerization rate is adjusted by suitable choice of temperature and type of peroxide.\n\nMethyl ethyl ketone peroxide, benzoyl peroxide and to a smaller degree acetone peroxide are used as initiators for radical polymerisation of some resins, e.g. polyester and silicone, often encountered when making fiberglass. Pinane hydroperoxide is used in production of styrene-butadiene (synthetic rubber).\n\nBenzoyl peroxide and hydrogen peroxide are used as bleaching and \"maturing\" agents for treating flour to make its grain release gluten more easily; the alternative is letting the flour slowly oxidize by air, which is too slow for the industrialized era. Benzoyl peroxide is an effective topical medication for treating most forms of acne.\n\nDialkylsulfates react with alkaline hydrogen peroxide. In this method, the alkyl sulfate donates the alkyl group and the sulfate ion forms the leaving group:\n\nThis method can also yield cyclic peroxides. The four-membered dioxetanes can be obtained by 2+2 cycloaddition of oxygen to alkenes.\n\nOrganoperoxides can be reduced to alcohols with lithium aluminium hydride, as described in this idealized equation:\n\nThe phosphite esters and tertiary phosphines also effect reduction:\n\nCleavage to ketones and alcohols in the base catalyzed Kornblum–DeLaMare rearrangement\n\nSome peroxides are drugs, whose action is based on the formation of radicals at desired locations in the organism. For example, artemisinin and its derivatives, such as such artesunate, possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against falciparum malaria. Artesunate is also efficient in reducing egg production in \"Schistosoma haematobium\" infection.\nSeveral analytical methods are used for qualitative and quantitative determination of peroxides. A simple qualitative detection of peroxides is carried out with the iodine-starch reaction. Here peroxides, hydroperoxides or peracids oxidize the added potassium iodide into iodine, which reacts with starch producing a deep-blue color. Commercial paper indicators using this reaction are available. This method is also suitable for quantitative evaluation, but it can not distinguish between different types of peroxide compounds. Discoloration of various indigo dyes in presence of peroxides is used instead for this purpose. For example, the loss of blue color in leuco-methylene blue is selective for hydrogen peroxide.\n\nQuantitative analysis of hydroperoxides can be performed using potentiometric titration with lithium aluminium hydride. Another way to evaluate the content of peracids and peroxides is the volumetric titration with alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide.\n\nEach peroxy group is considered to contain one active oxygen atom. The concept of active oxygen content is useful for comparing the relative concentration of peroxy groups in formulations, which is related to the energy content. In general, energy content increases with active oxygen content, and thus the higher the molecular weight of the organic groups, the lower the energy content and, usually, the lower the hazard.\n\nThe term active oxygen is used to specify the amount of peroxide present in any organic peroxide formulation. One of the oxygen atoms in each peroxide group is considered \"active\". The theoretical amount of active oxygen can be described by the following equation:\n\nwhere \"p\" is the number of peroxide groups in the molecule, and \"m\" is the molecular mass of the pure peroxide.\n\nOrganic peroxides are often sold as formulations that include one or more phlegmatizing agents. That is, for safety sake or performance benefits the properties of an organic peroxide formulation are commonly modified by the use of additives to phlegmatize (desensitize), stabilize, or otherwise enhance the organic peroxide for commercial use. Commercial formulations occasionally consist of mixtures of organic peroxides, which may or may not be phlegmatized.\n\nOrganic peroxides are useful in chemical synthesis due to their propensity to decompose. In doing so they generate useful radicals that can initiate polymerization to create polymers, modify polymers by grafting or visbreaking, or cross-link polymers to create a thermoset. When used for these purposes, the peroxide is highly diluted, so the heat generated by the exothermic decomposition is safely absorbed by the surrounding medium (e.g. polymer compound or emulsion). But when a peroxide is in a more pure form, the heat evolved by its decomposition may not dissipate as quickly as it is generated, which can result in increasing temperature, which further intensifies the rate of exothermic decomposition. This can create a dangerous situation known as a \"self-accelerating decomposition\".\n\nA self-accelerating decomposition occurs when the rate of peroxide decomposition is sufficient to generate heat at a faster rate than it can be dissipated to the environment. Temperature is the main factor in the rate of decomposition. The lowest temperature at which a packaged organic peroxide will undergo a self-accelerating decomposition within a week is defined as the \"self-accelerating decomposition temperature\" (SADT).\n\nPeroxides are also strong oxidizers and easily react with skin, cotton and wood pulp. For safety reasons, peroxidic compounds are stored in a cool, opaque container, as heating and illumination accelerate their chemical reactions. Small amounts of peroxides, which emerge from storage or reaction vessels are neutralized using reducing agents such as iron(II) sulfate. Safety measures in industrial plants producing large amounts of peroxides include the following:\n\n1) The equipment is located within reinforced concrete structures with foil windows, which would relieve pressure and not shatter in case of explosion.\n\n2) The products are bottled in small containers and are moved to a cold place promptly after the synthesis.\n\n3) The containers are made of non-reactive materials such as stainless steel, some aluminium alloys or dark glass.\n\nFor safe handling of concentrated organic peroxides, an important parameter is temperature of the sample, which should be maintained below the self accelerating decomposition temperature of the compound.\n\nThe shipping of organic peroxides is restricted. The US Department of Transportation lists organic peroxide shipping restrictions and forbidden materials in 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table based on the concentration and physical state of the material:\n\n\n"}

Kingsley is most famous for his 1969 influential electronic instrumental composition \"Popcorn\". \n\nKingsley conducted and arranged many Broadway musicals, and composed for film, television shows and commercials. His compositions were eclectic and vary between avant-garde and pop styles. Kingsley also composed classical chamber works, and his opera \"Raoul\" was premiered in Bremen, Germany in 2008. His work was recognized with a Tony Award nomination for Best Conductor and Musical Director, two Clio Awards for his work in advertising music, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Bob Moog Foundation.\n\nKingsley died on December 10, 2019 at the age of 97 in Manhattan, New York.\n\nKingsley was born Götz Gustav Ksinski in 1922 in Bochum, Weimar Republic, the son of Marie Christina, a homemaker, and Max Ksinski, a carpet dealer and pianist. His father was born Jewish and his mother, originally Catholic, converted to Judaism. He grew up in Berlin where his parents ran a large carpet shop. They had originally met in Essen, when his father, returning from Berlin on a business trip, had dropped in to a wine bar managed by two sisters, one of whom soon became Kingsley's mother. The elder Ksinski had spent the evening playing the piano in the bar, after which romance quickly blossomed.\n\nKingsley became a member of a Zionist youth movement and at the age of 15 left Germany in 1938, a few days before Kristallnacht and joined kibbutz Ein Harod, Mandatory Palestine, while his parents stayed behind at that time. At the kibbutz he taught himself to play the piano. He joined the Hagana Jewish Settlement Police (Notrim) and also played jazz in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. He studied at the Jerusalem conservatory of music.\n\nHis parents and brother had escaped to Cuba, from where, eventually, they succeeded in obtaining visas for the United States, where Kingsley met up with them eight years later.\n\nHis career as a pop musician took off with the release of \"The In Sound from Way Out!\" album in 1966, which he recorded with Jean-Jacques Perrey. The Perrey and Kingsley duo went on to record \"\", released the next year, and subsequently went their separate ways. Kingsley then pursued a solo career recording \"Music to Moog By\", released in 1969, a classic Moog album consisting mainly of cover songs, originally by The Beatles, Beethoven, and Simon and Garfunkel, but there also was original material, like his best known composition, \"Popcorn\", which became his \"signature song\". His next music effort was with a band called First Moog Quartet: they recorded only an album titled \"First Moog Quartet\", released in 1970, which consisted of live recordings from his nationwide tour featuring four Moog synthesizers. Some of these compositions are more experimental, featuring spoken word and beat poetry backed by synthetic noises and tones. Kingsley then moved beyond the Moog, and later pioneered the use of the earliest Fairlight and Synclavier digital synthesizers.\n\nMany artists have covered \"Popcorn\", including Hot Butter, Jean Michel Jarre, Aphex Twin, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, Marsheaux, Muse, Crazy Frog and The Muppets. The composition was used in the Soviet animated series \"Nu, pogodi!\".\n\nKingsley (with Perrey) is also credited with composing the song \"Baroque Hoedown\", released in their 1967 album, used by Walt Disney Productions for the Main Street Electrical Parade at its theme parks; and the song \"The Savers\", best known as the theme for the game show \"The Joker's Wild\". He also wrote the logo sting (animated logo accompanied with music) for WGBH-TV in Boston, that appears throughout the United States on PBS programming produced by the station.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2296648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296648", "title": "Mokola lyssavirus", "text": "Mokola lyssavirus\n\nMokola lyssavirus, commonly called Mokola virus (MOKV), is a RNA virus related to rabies virus that has been sporadically isolated from mammals across sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of isolates have come from domestic cats exhibiting symptoms characteristically associated to rabies virus infection.\n\nThere have been two reported cases of humans being infected with Mokola virus.\n\nMokola virus (MOKV) is a member of the genus \"Lyssavirus\", which belongs to the family \"Rhabdoviridae\". MOKV is one of four lyssaviruses found in Africa. The other three viruses are the classic rabies virus, Duvenhage virus and Lagos bat virus.\n\nMOKV was first isolated in Nigeria, in 1968, from three shrews (\"Crocidura\" species) found in the Mokola forest, Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The virus was shown to be morphologically and serologically related to rabies virus. Since the initial isolation of MOKV, the virus has been mainly isolated in domestic cats and small mammals in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThere have been two recorded cases of human infection with MOKV, with both instances occurring in Nigeria. Both cases involved young Nigerian females. The first patient, who had been suffering from a fever and convulsions, recovered fully from infection. The second case, which occurred in 1972, involved a 6-year-old girl who had been suffering from drowsiness. The second patient ultimately suffered from paralysis and a terminal coma as a result of the MOKV infection.\n\nThe origin of the MOKV in both human cases of MOKV infection remains unidentified.\n\nThe MOKV genome consists of a non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA molecule of 11,939 nucleotides in length. It is estimated that 90.3% of the MOKV genome consists of protein-encoding or signal-encoding sequences.\n\nThe genome encodes five proteins: matrix protein M; transmembrane glycoprotein G; nucleoprotein N; phosphoprotein P; and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L.\n\nMOKV is an enveloped virus, with the envelope lined with spikes consisting of the viral protein G. MOKV exhibits the 'bullet-shaped' morphology that is characteristic of members of the \"Rhabdoviridae\" family.\n\nThis virus appears to have evolved between 279 and 2,034 years before the present.\n\nThe human cases of human MOKV infection have demonstrated the zoonotic potential of MOKV but as a natural reservoir has yet to be identified, transmission of the virus is poorly understood. Considering the MOKV isolates from small mammals and domestic cats; it has been suggested that small mammals, which are preyed upon by domestic cats, may be the natural MOKV reservoir.\n\nUnlike other \"lyssavirus\"es, MOKV is able to replicate inside mosquito cells \"in vitro\", suggesting that insects may be implicated in MOKV transmission.\n\nSymptoms provoked by MOKV infection are similar to the symptoms associated with rabies virus infection, such as fever and headache. Ultimately, both MOKV and rabies virus infection can lead to death by encephalitis. The similarity between the symptoms associated with MOKV and rabies virus may be the reason why there are so few case records of MOKV infection, as MOKV infection might be falsely diagnosed as rabies virus infection.\n\nThere is one significant difference between the symptoms observed in domestic cats infected with MOKV and those with rabies virus. MOKV-infected domestic cats do not demonstrate the unprovoked aggressive behaviour typically associated with rabies virus-infected mammals.\n\nAt present, there is no medical or veterinary vaccine that protects against MOKV infection. It has long been established that, in spite of the relatedness between MOKV and rabies virus, immunisation with the rabies vaccine does \"not\" confer protection from MOKV infection. Isolation of MOKV from a number of domestic cats vaccinated with the rabies vaccine has demonstrated this.\n\nIn order to neutralize rabies virus, the rabies vaccine targets the transmembrane glycoprotein G on the viral envelope. Variation in the amino acid sequences of the antigenic domain III within protein G between rabies virus and MOKV has rendered the rabies vaccine ineffective against MOKV infection.\n"}

At seventeen years of age he even committed murder. In the prisons, however, he studied hard and became skilful in letters and various arts. When finally set in liberty, he engaged himself in an energetic and enterprising public life by teaching and publishing. He aimed at an overall transformation of society in which the poor and abject would be given a rightful place as citizens of a free republic. Having incurred the wrath of the dominant political forces and the privileged classes, Dimech was permanently exiled from the island and was buried in Egypt in an unmarked grave.\n\nThe main literary source for Dimech's biography is Mark Montebello's extensive work \"Dimech\", published in 2004 (PEG, Malta; vol. 1 of the 2nd edition published in 2013 by Miller Distributors, Malta). Though it is in Maltese, a fully documented biography in English is available as \"The Amazing Story of Manuel Dimech\" (Dom Communications, Malta 2014) and in \"Aphorisms: Wisdom of a Philosopher in Exile\" (SKS, Malta 2012).\n\nManuel Dimech was born on Christmas Day (December 25), 1860, at St John Street, Valletta, Malta, and baptised at the church of St Paul Shipwreck, Valletta. His family was poor and lived in a single room that was part of a common tenement house with over sixty people. His ancestors on his father's side were genuine artistic sculptors, though up till Dimech's birth his family had fallen on difficult times. During his childhood, Dimech's family moved residence twice, leaving Valletta for Qormi (today Santa Venera), and then moving to Msida. His father tried hard to make ends meet, but his weak health prevented any success in this endeavour. He died at the age of 37, leaving his widow to care for their ten young children.\n\nJust a fortnight after his father's death the 13-year-old Dimech committed his first recorded crime of petty theft. He was a street urchin with no education, guidance or direction. For his first crime he was sent two days in a lockup. This experience did not stop him from delving deeper into a life of crime. Subsequently, he was to be sent nine more times to prison, sometimes for very serious crimes. Mostly it was for theft or burglary, but in 1878, when he was 17 years old, he committed involuntary murder, and was imprisoned for more than twelve years. In 1890, then, he was found guilty of forging counterfeit money (though he only traded it), and was imprisoned for a further seven years. He was definitely released from prison in 1897 at the age of 36. In all he had spent some twenty years of incarceration.\n\nWhile in prison Dimech began to learn how to read and write. This was in 1877, when he was 17 years old. With all the time of the world on his hands he quickly became an avid reader, absorbing all kinds of stuff: literature, grammar, politics, history, philosophy, religion, and more. He discovered he had a special penchant for languages, and in prison he learnt the ins and outs of Maltese, English, French and Italian to perfection. Later he would make a living teaching these languages. He had a good brain and a fruitful mind. His keen interest in politics was not committed to petty squabbles or parochial issues, but burrowed deep into the structural causes of poverty and oppression. All of this would serve him well in the public sphere.\n\nIn prison Dimech had another kind of formation. During his last stint in prison between 1890 and 1897, a certain Marquis Giorgio Barbaro was appointed Commissioner of Prison. This man was a psychopath who made the life of prisoners, vulnerable and defenceless as they were, a hell on earth. He tortured, murdered, persecuted and tormented prisoners ceaselessly. He also perjured his way into sending at least two prisoners to the gallows for crimes they had not committed. Dimech saw all this and lived through it with growing agony. The experience, together with the reading he was doing, moulded him into a daring, powerful and intrepid personality.\n\nOnce out of prison in 1897, Dimech embarked on an outstanding public career that brought him fame, though not immediate success. From the start of 1898 he issued a weekly in Maltese that was to serve him as his mouthpiece for many years to come. He called it \"Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin\" (The Flag of the Maltese; pronounced \"ilbaandeera taal maaltin\"). Through it he explored, albeit with the language and prose of the times, the structures of oppression in a country that had been a colony of Britain since 1800, and in the clutches of the Catholic Church since time immemorial. Furthermore, Dimech proposed the way forward. He advocated the education of the masses, and audaciously specified how Malta could one day be an economically self-sufficient independent republic.\n\nDimech adhered to a philosophy that he called ‘of action’, a position very close, though directly unrelated, to the contemporaneous Pragmatism of the United States. He came at this position through his acquaintance with the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and other British Empiricists and philosophers of Utilitarianism. He claimed that actions can be considered right or wrong, and value judgments can be rightly gauged, according to whether they perform well when applied to practice. Actions, he maintained, proceed from the \"power\" that knowledge possesses \"from itself\". Furthermore, actions are aimed at acquiring happiness, first, for the individual, and, simultaneously, for the whole community of individuals.\n\nDuring his lifetime Dimech issued various publications. The 462 editions of \"Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin\" are perhaps the foremost. But others are also interesting. Amongst these one can find other newspapers in foreign languages (of short duration), two novels, grammar books (in Italian, English, French, and Maltese), and pamphlets. Unfortunately, books of poetry have not survived. Dimech's main objective with these publications was to form a political class from amongst the people, especially young men and women who had not the possibility of acquiring an education otherwise. Dimech was enamored of the Maltese language, and saw it as an efficacious tool of emancipation.\n\nDimech had travelled to Tunis in 1890 for expediency reasons. However, in 1903 he visited Montenegro (for almost three weeks) to study at close range the social and political situation there. He enhanced this experience by travelling twice to the north of Italy (especially Genoa, Milan and Turin), where, in all, he spent almost four years. There Dimech became particularly acquainted to workers’ movements and the trade unions. He was also very interested in the state-church relationship that prevailed in Italy during that fascinating time. Understandably, he came back to Malta fired up and all ready to bring about the social changes he had been mulling over for many years.\n\nIt is indisputable that Dimech wanted, and worked for, an overhaul of the social system. His main aim was to pull the carpet from under the structures of oppression, whether they were maintained by the British colonial government, the Catholic Church, the privileged class, the landed gentry, or whoever. His strategy was to begin with the political education of a new grass-root group of people, and subsequently permeate the illiterate, underprivileged and destitute masses. His ultimate aims were to make Malta an industrialised country that could be economically self-reliant and, eventually, be worthy of independence.\n\nDefinitely back to Malta from Italy in 1911, Dimech founded what he called \"Ix-Xirka ta' l-Imdawlin\" (The League of the Enlightened; pronounced \"ishirka taal imdaaulin\"). This was a sort of union in the modern understanding of the word, in the sense that it was a social club, an organisation militating for workers’ rights, a school of adult education, and a political party all in one. Through this league Dimech hoped to have a say, and transformative influence, in the political, and then the social, and maybe also the religious, fields. Young idealists and people craving for change flocked to him, and not only from the lower class but also from the middle and higher classes. Dimech's political “revolution” had begun.\n\nBut immediately Dimech was held in his tracks. The then mighty Catholic Church pounced on him, and first condemned \"Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin\" and \"Ix-Xirka ta' l-Imdawlin\", and shortly afterward excommunicated Dimech himself. Though this was an overwhelmingly devastating blow in all respects in Malta of the 1910s, Dimech was undaunted. He fought back with the little freedom of movement and action that was left to him, and stalwartly stood his ground. For a whole year, between 1911 and 1912, he and his family were systematically and pitilessly persecuted by the Church, but nothing could break his back. Then, obliquely admitting defeat, the Church called a truce and retired Dimech's excommunication on December 1, 1912. \n\nDimech had won against all odds, and immediately re-established his former organization with the name \"Ix-Xirka tal-Maltin\" (The League of the Maltese; pronounced \"ishirka tal maltin\").\n\nBut the Catholic Church was not the only institution disgruntled with Dimech. The British colonial government was unhappy with his widespread and growing influence amongst the workers at the Royal shipyards. Indeed, the great majority of Dimech's foot soldiers came from there, and this threatened to precariously disrupt the use of Malta as one of His Majesty's major Mediterranean naval base. Slowly but surely, and perhaps not without a push or two from the authorities of the Catholic Church, the powers to be began to close upon this little man who was considered dangerous enough to be destroyed.\n\nJust over a year after Dimech re-launched his \"Xirka tal-Maltin\", he was arrested. World War I had just begun, and Malta’s British governor accepted the accusation that Dimech was a spy of Germany (then at war with Britain), and surreptitiously deported him to the island to Sicily, in Italy (as yet a neutral country in the war). There he was shortly arrested again, and asked to leave to a country, save Malta, of his own choice. Dimech chose Egypt, then a British protectorate. Again, shortly afterwards, he was arrested once more, this time for good. For the remaining days of his life, for seven long and miserable years, Dimech lived in prisons or concentration camps either at Alexandria or Cairo.\n\nAt some unspecified time the British began to consider Dimech as a “prisoner of war”. However, when World War I came to an end in 1918, he was not released. Technically and actually, Dimech then became an exile, and he remained so until the end of his days. Various pleas for his return to Malta were refused by the British colonial government in Malta, even when these were repeatedly made by the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Edmund Allenby, and later by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Winston Churchill.\n\nAt the end of 1918 Dimech was transferred to a concentration camp at Sidi Bishr in Alexandria, Egypt. Dire prison conditions caused his health to deteriorate fast. In November 1920, after becoming half-paralyzed by apoplexy, he was transferred to Victoria College, Alexandria, at Sidi Bishr itself, a college that had been transformed into a hospital due to war exigencies. But by then Dimech was doomed. He died in Alexandria on April 17, 1921, and was unceremoniously buried in the sand grounds of Victoria College, Alexandria, itself. His grave was unmarked, and all attempts to locate it have been futile.\n\nA small group of young followers of Dimech continued to be somewhat active in Malta well after his deportation in 1914. They organized Malta’s first recorded strike at the Royal shipyards in 1920, and were significantly amongst the rioters against the British colonial government on 7 June 1919, riots which led to the granting of Malta’s first self-government. They were harassed and persecuted harshly by the colonial government, especially in 1914 and 1933, so much so that to be a Dimechian became quickly tantamount to public disgrace. By time, the few faithful Dimechians died out, and Dimech himself was forgotten.\n\nDimech was re-introduced to the public by Gerald Azzopardi (1910–1993) in the 1960s, and later, in the 1970s, he was given more academic validity by Henry Frendo. This led to a renewed interest in Dimech's life. Also in the 1970s, the socialist Prime Minister, Dom Mintoff, transformed Dimech into a sort of socialist icon, even though Dimech himself would have been ill at ease with such a recognition. However, Dimech's fame was finally set. A small run of one Maltese pound coins were produced engraved with his name and likeness in 1972. A monument to him was erected in 1976 in front of the Prime Minister's office in Valletta, at one of Malta's main squares. In 2004 Dr Mark Montebello placed the study and appreciation of Dimech on a new and unprecedented standing with a master biographical work called simply \"Dimech\" (PEG, Malta), which started to behold Dimech's personality in a more balanced and objective way.\n\nOn October 14, 2012, the discovery of new Dimech manuscripts was announced dating from the last three years of his exile. The manuscripts contain an extensive work in English made up of thousands of aphorisms, and some fables, epitaphs and poems. The discovery was made in two phases, in 2002 and 2009. Dimech's work was published in 2012 by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti, SKS, as \"Aphorisms: Wisdom of a philosopher in exile\".\n\nIn April 2013, Karl Fiorini composed a work called 'Sinfonietta Pro Populo' based on the 'Innu Malti' (the Maltese Hymn) written by Dimech. He created a refined symphony which placed revolutionary aspirations within the modern parameters of music. The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra, notwithstanding all the problems with which it was faced, emerged triumphant under the musical directorship of Brian Schembri.\n\nA year later, in June 2014, Henry Frendo published yet other hitherto unknown manuscripts belonging to Dimech dating from the early 1880s (when Dimech was still in prison). The publication, \"Dimech's Lost Prison Poems\" (Midsea Books), contains poems by Dimech (some of which signed and dated in his own hand), and letters received by Dimech while in prison.\n\nAs a sign of national recognition, on November 10, 2012, the President of Malta, Dr George Abela, unveiled in St John Street, Valletta, a commemorative plaque marking the birthplace of Dimech. A year later, on October 13, 2013, the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr Joseph Muscat, unveiled in Qormi another commemorative plaque marking the spot were, in 1912, Dimech had been stoned by a mob. On September 5, 2014, exactly 100 years to the day since the beginning of Dimech's exile, the President of Malta, Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, unveiled, close to the Customs house at Valletta (from where Dimech was sent to his exile), yet another commemorative plaque marking the event.\n\nIn April 2019 it was announced that a foundation will be established bearing Dimech's name. Though it was stated that the foundation will be \"dedicated to the ideals of Dimech,\" details had to be announced further on.\n\nDimech evocatively and compellingly advocated the emancipation of the masses. His assault on the entrenched structures of oppression in Malta was extraordinary, outstanding and unmatched by anything that had gone before. Dimech was not a nationalist, an anti-colonialist or a socialist in any way we would understand the terms today. He was, first and foremost, an enemy of any kind of domination, coercion, cruelty, tyranny, repression and subjugation. If this made him a nationalist, an anti-colonialist or some kind of socialist, it was surely only in an indirect and oblique way. Dimech did not achieve in his lifetime what he set out to accomplish. He was violently and unjustly truncated. Most of the policies he advocated were implemented some half a century after his death by Dom Mintoff in the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}

He received recognition in the UK with his first leading role as John Thornton in the British television programme \"North & South\" (2004). His role as dwarf prince and leader Thorin Oakenshield in Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation of \"The Hobbit\" brought him international recognition. Other notable roles include John Proctor in Yaël Farber's stage production of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\", Francis Dolarhyde in the American TV series \"Hannibal\", Lucas North in the British TV drama \"Spooks\", John Porter in the British TV drama \"Strike Back\", Daniel Miller in the EPIX spy series \"Berlin Station\" and Guy of Gisborne in the British TV drama \"Robin Hood\". He voiced Trevor Belmont in the Netflix adaptation of \"Castlevania\". In 2020, he played the lead role in the Netflix miniseries \"The Stranger\".\n\nAfter graduating from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), Armitage initially sought theatre work and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). He turned to film and television roles when he noticed that leading stage roles went to actors with name recognition who could bring in patrons to fill venues. After twelve years away and having earned that name recognition, Armitage returned to the stage in 2014 taking his first leading role in a major production. He played John Proctor in the successful and critically acclaimed production of \"The Crucible\" at The Old Vic, and earned an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor.\n\nOne of Armitage's trademarks is his baritone voice, which he has employed as a voice actor since 2006. While working on the TV series \"Robin Hood\", he was asked to record audiobooks for the first season of that series. Armitage has recorded several audiobooks and has worked as a narrator on TV and radio shows and adverts.\n\nArmitage was born in Leicester, England, the younger son of Margaret, a secretary, and John Armitage, an engineer. Richard has an older brother named Chris. He attended Huncote Community Primary School in Huncote, Blaby District, Leicestershire and began secondary school at the local comprehensive school, Brockington College in Enderby.\n\nAt Brockington, Armitage pursued his interest in music – playing the cello in school and local orchestras, and learning how to play the flute. By fourteen, having secured a grant from the Leicestershire Authority, he successfully persuaded his mother to allow him to transfer to Pattison College in Coventry, an independent boarding school specialising in the Performing Arts so that he could focus on drama and dance.\n\nArmitage has expressed gratitude for the lessons and opportunities Pattison College provided, saying \"It... instilled me with a discipline that has stood me in good stead – never to be late, to know your lines and to be professional.\" By the time he finished school, he had achieved A Levels in music and English, and acting experience in local amateur and professional productions such as \"Showboat\", \"Half a Sixpence\", \"Orpheus and the Underworld\" (as Bacchus) and \"The Hobbit\" (as an elf) at the New Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham.\n\nAfter completing the programme at Pattison College in 1988, Armitage joined the Nachtcircus in Budapest for six months to obtain his Equity Card, a requirement at the time for entertainment professionals to work in the UK. Returning to the UK, he pursued a career in musical theatre – working as an assistant choreographer to Kenn Oldfield and performing in various productions, including the ensembles of \"42nd Street\", \"My One and Only\", \"Nine\", \"Annie Get Your Gun\" and as Admetus and Macavity in \"Cats\". Armitage was also pursuing acting in dramatic theatre productions, including \"The Real Thing\", \"Six Degrees of Separation\" and \"Death of a Salesman\".\n\nBy 1992, he began to doubt if musical theatre was the right career path, so he enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) in 1993 to further study acting. \"I needed to do something a bit more truthful than musical theatre. For me it was a bit too theatrical and all about standing on stage and showing off. I was looking for something else, so that's why I went back to drama school.\"\n\nAfter completing LAMDA's three-year programme, he returned to the stage as a supporting player with the Royal Shakespeare Company's productions of \"Macbeth\" and \"The Duchess of Malfi\", as well as \"Hamlet\" and \"Four Alice Bakers\" with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre while taking a series of small roles in television and films. In 2002 he starred in the Charm Offensive's production of \"Use Me As Your Cardigan\".\n\nThat same year Armitage appeared in his first major television role, as John Standring in the BBC drama \"Sparkhouse\" (2002). \"It was the first time I went to an audition in character. It was a minor role but it was something I really got my teeth into... I couldn't go back. I knew I had to approach everything the same way.\" After this he took supporting roles in the TV productions of \"Between the Sheets\", \"Cold Feet\" (series 5), and \"Ultimate Force\" (series 2).\n\nIn 2004, Armitage landed his first leading role as textile mill owner John Thornton in the BBC adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's \"North & South\". The director and producers took a chance casting a little-known actor for their leading man. He was the first actor to audition for the role and the last person cast. \"North & South\" was an unexpected success. The BBC message boards crashed shortly after the telecast as a result of chatter about him and he was hailed as the new \"Mr. Darcy\" (referring to Colin Firth's \"Mr Darcy\" whom many regard as the definitive romantic leading man). Armitage did not perceive John Thornton as the ideal romantic leading man role and was surprised by the response. Instead, he said that he felt personally drawn to the role, as his father's family had been weavers. He cited Thornton's dualism as drawing him to the character. \"The dichotomy between the powerful, almost monstrous, entrepreneur and this kind of vulnerable boy is exciting for me to look at.\"\nIn 2005, he played Peter MacDuff in \"Macbeth\" in the BBC's \"ShakespeaRe-Told\" series and appeared as a recovering gambling addict in one episode of \"Inspector Lynley Mysteries\". He starred in \"The Impressionists\", playing the young Claude Monet, and as Dr Alec Track in ITV's \"The Golden Hour\", a medical series based on the London Air Ambulance. His first substantial role in movies was in the independent film \"Frozen\".\n\nIn 2006, Armitage was cast as Guy of Gisborne in the BBC series \"Robin Hood\", which was filmed in Hungary. \"In order to sustain the character of Guy, you have to find the conflict within him. He's constantly pulled between good and evil, between who he wants to be and who he actually is. He could have been a good man, but he is forever dragged down by his fatal flaw – that he wants glory at all costs.\" Approaching the third series, he said, \"I do love playing him, but with a character like Gisborne, if you give him what he needs, then in a way, it's over. That character is only interesting when he isn't getting what he wants, whether it's power, money or the girl.\" The third and final series of Robin Hood started on 28 March 2009.\n\nArmitage appeared in a two-part 2006/07 Christmas/New Years special of \"The Vicar of Dibley\", as Harry Kennedy, the vicar's new love interest (and eventual husband). He reprised the role in 2007 for Red Nose Day. On 8 April 2007, he played biker Ricky Deeming in the detective drama \"George Gently\" with Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby. On 9 May 2007, he appeared in the BBC Four production of \"Miss Marie Lloyd – Queen of The Music Hall\" playing Marie Lloyd's first husband, Percy Courtenay. He also appeared in the Granada TV production of Agatha Christie's novel \"Ordeal by Innocence\" as the character Philip Durrant.\n\nArmitage joined the cast of \"Spooks\" as the character Lucas North for series 7, which began on 27 October 2008 in the UK. Armitage notes that the character, who spent eight years in a Russian prison, has a personable exterior, but is psychologically damaged. \"I love films with a combination of action and good characters. That's why Lucas is interesting as I get to play someone with a complex psychology who goes out there and tries to save the world.\" During the filming of series 7 Armitage allowed himself to be subjected to waterboarding to film a flashback sequence. In July 2010, Armitage completed filming of series 9, his final series.\n\nOn 20 May 2009, Armitage appeared in the BBC1 drama \"Moving On\" as John Mulligan.\n\nIn May 2010, Armitage starred as former SAS trooper John Porter in \"Strike Back\" (also known as \"Chris Ryan's Strike Back\") for Sky1. Filmed in South Africa, Armitage found the main challenge of the role was to show how the character resolved being a trained killer with having a family and home life. \"In the end it was the character I was attracted to, the story of a man who makes a decision under pressure and that decision has a knock-on effect on his whole life,\" he said. \"He goes in search of atonement still believing he did the right thing even though it cost the lives of three of his friends... There's anger and there's injustice. It's like, 'I did the right thing, with the wrong outcome.'\" By the time Sky1 and Cinemax decided to commission a second series of \"Strike Back\" called \"\", Armitage had committed to \"The Hobbit\" and was unable to continue in the series. However, he appeared as a guest star in the first episode to resolve John Porter's fate.\n\nIt was his role as John Porter that led to his casting in \"\". American casting agents noticed posters of him as John Porter in London. Although unknown to them, they offered him the role of Nazi spy Heinz Kruger because he looked the part. Armitage accepted and shot his scenes in the autumn of 2010, after filming wrapped on \"Spooks\", series 9. The film was released in July 2011.\n\nOn 21 October 2010, Peter Jackson announced Armitage was cast as Thorin Oakenshield in the three-film production of \"The Hobbit\". Principal photography in New Zealand ran from March 2011 to July 2012, broken into three filming blocks with breaks in-between, and pick-ups were shot in the summer of 2013. All three films were released in December, starting with \"\" in 2012, \"\" in 2013 and \"\" in 2014. Armitage thought it was a wonderful opportunity, as he grew up reading the books. Coincidentally, one of his first stage roles was playing an elf in a production of \"The Hobbit\" at the Alex Theatre in Birmingham. He describes the character of Thorin as being complex and flawed, \"somebody that had doubts and that had fears, and there was a gentle side to him and a very perhaps lonely side to him.\" He notes the scene with Balin in Bag End shows the character's inner sensitivity and fear of failure, \"failing where his father and his grandfather had failed as well.\"\n\nAfter filming wrapped on \"The Hobbit\", Armitage flew to Detroit, Michigan to film \"Into the Storm\" from July to September 2012. He starred as Gary Fuller, a high school Vice Principal with two teenage sons. The film from New Line was released in August 2014.\n\nIn March 2014, Armitage began the eight-week shoot of an adaptation of Bernard Hare's memoir \"Urban Grimshaw and the Shed Crew\" in Leeds, UK. He played \"Chop\" (the author's nickname), an ex-social worker, drunk and drug addict in Britain's lowerclass who befriends the hardened young delinquent Urban. Armitage explained his attraction to this role: \"it ticks a few boxes for me: it\"s based on a really interesting piece of literature, but also based on living people, who have been working with us on set.\" \"Urban and the Shed Crew\" premiered at the Leeds International Film Festival (LIFF) on 7 November 2015.\n\nArmitage next appeared as John Proctor in The Old Vic's production of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\". Directed by Yaël Farber and performed in the round, the play ran from 21 June to 13 September 2014. The production drew an unprecedented number of 5-star reviews and was a commercial success. For his performance, Armitage was awarded Best Leading Actor in a New Production of a Play by Broadway World:UK Awards 2014 and a Best Actor nomination for an Olivier Award. Due to worldwide demand to see the production, Digital Theatre captured the live performance to bring \"The Crucible\" to cinemas and for digital download. It was screened at cinemas on 4 and 7 December 2014 in the UK and Ireland, with further screenings in other selected territories in February and March 2015. Copyright issues prevented the film from being screened at North American cinemas. Digital Theatre made the digital download available worldwide on 17 March 2015.\n\nIn a September 2014 interview, Armitage revealed he would film his cameo role of King Oleron in \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" in London after \"The Crucible\" closed. The film was released in May 2016.\n\nArmitage spent four weeks in October 2014 filming \"Sleepwalker\" in the greater Los Angeles area. In this psychological thriller, Armitage plays Dr. Scott White, a senior MD at a sleep research centre. No release date has been set.\n\nDeLaurentiis Company tweeted on 13 January 2015 that Armitage was cast as Francis Dolarhyde in the TV production of \"Hannibal\", written and co-produced by Bryan Fuller. Dolarhyde is a serial killer, a character type which Armitage had expressed interest in portraying. He filmed the series in Toronto, Canada from January to April, and the series aired from 4 June to 29 August 2015. Armitage appeared in the last six episodes of season 3, earning high praise, wide acclaim and several award nominations, including two wins.\n\nAfter wrapping on \"Hannibal\" in late April 2015, Armitage joined his fellow \"Pilgrimage\" castmates who had already begun filming in Connemara, Ireland two weeks prior. He plays Sir Raymond De Merville, a 13th-century French Norman who is intent on foiling a group of monks escorting a sacred relic from Ireland to Rome. The cast and crew later moved to the Ardennes region of Belgium to complete filming, with Armitage wrapping one week earlier than the film wrap at the end of May.\n\nNews broke on 13 May 2015 that Armitage would star in \"Clearance\", the first English language film by Finnish director Aku Louhimies and set to film in South Africa in November 2015. It is an action drama about a hardened mine expert named Ray (Armitage) and his pregnant partner (Naomi Harris) who are kidnapped in South Sudan.\n\nIn a June 2015 interview, Armitage mentioned his next projects included an Edith Wharton film and a true Irish tragic drama. Per agent David Higham, \"Bridget Cleary\" is likely the Irish drama.\n\nOn 12 July 2015, Armitage revealed he was about to start filming \"Brain on Fire\" in Vancouver, Canada. Subsequent news outlets provided more details about his role as \"Big Man\" Tom Cahalan, father of the protagonist in the true-life story of young journalist Susannah Cahalan's sudden descent into inexplicable madness and the eleventh-hour diagnosis by one doctor. Filming began 13 July 2015. \"Brain on Fire\" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on 14 September 2016.\n\nArmitage landed the lead role of Daniel Miller in \"Berlin Station\", an original spy series for Epix. His character, a cerebral analyst from Langley, is a newly anointed undercover CIA officer tasked with finding a mole in Berlin. Filmed in Berlin from November 2015 to April 2016, with some additional filming in the Canary Islands, the series premiered on Epix in the fall of 2016.\n\nOn 13 July 2016, Roundabout Theatre Company announced Armitage was cast as Kenneth in the American premiere of \"Love, Love, Love\" by playwright Mike Bartlett. \"Love, Love, Love\" marks Armitage's first leading role in a theatrical play on an American stage. The off-Broadway play ran from 22 September to 18 December 2016 at the intimate Laura Pels Theater in New York City.\n\nArmitage co-starred in the heist comedy \"Ocean's 8\" (2018).\n\nIn February 2017, it was announced that Armitage had joined the cast of Julie Delpy's film \"My Zoe\". In it he will play the role of James, the ex-husband of Delpy's character Isabelle. Their toxic marriage may be over but they are still in contact with each other as they co-parent their daughter Zoe. But when tragedy strikes this fractured family, Isabelle takes matters into her own hands. In February 2018, Armitage joined the cast of \"The Lodge\", which began filming in early February. Armitage plays the leading role of Adam Price in Netflix's 2020 mystery thriller miniseries, The Stranger, which is based on the Harlan Coben novel of the same title. The series has been critically acclaimed, with a rating of 89% from Rotten Tomatoes. \n\nArmitage was introduced to voice work while working on the TV drama \"Robin Hood\" in 2006. The BBC was publishing novels of the first four episodes of series one and asked Armitage to record the audiobook versions. In recent years, Armitage has also performed a great deal of voice work, such as reading poetry for various radio programmes and starring as Robert Lovelace in BBC Radio 4's production of \"Clarissa: A History of a Young Lady\" in April 2010. He has recorded eleven audio books: six based on BBC's \"Robin Hood\", Bernard Cornwell's \"The Lords of the North\", three Georgette Heyer novels for Naxos AudioBooks (\"Sylvester, or the Wicked Uncle\", \"Venetia\", and \"The Convenient Marriage\") and \"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel\". He has narrated television documentaries such as \"Homes from Hell\", \"Empire's Children\", \"Too Poor for Posh School?\", \"The Great Sperm Race\", \"Forest Elephants: Rumble in the Jungle\", \"Surgery School\", and \"Elsa: The Lioness That Changed the World\". In 2011, he provided the narration for a series about the Royal Navy flagship , \"125 Years of Wimbledon: You Cannot Be Serious\", and \"Fraud Squad\". He has also provided the voice-over for many TV and radio advertisements, and stars as lead character Trevor Belmont in the Netflix animated series \"Castlevania.\"\n\nArmitage was hoping to star in a drama based on Richard III. Armitage was born on the anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth Field, where Richard III was killed and has said \"I believe it is a great story, a socio-political thriller, a love story and a dynastic tragedy.\" He thinks the story has the potential to be told as a twenty-episode miniseries. A script has been in development since 2010 and \"a lot of people... are interested [in producing it], but there is no one that will step on the gas.\" Armitage stated that he is still interested in the project, though he has reservations that he might be too tall and too old to play Richard III.\n\nArmitage has described himself as a method actor. \"Yeah, I suppose I am. In a way it's slightly lazy because it means you don't have to pretend – you just have to believe. As much as it's possible to be like that I suppose I kind of do step in and out, I'm not one of these people that can't talk to other people because I'm in my character, but I kind of do stay with the character, yeah. He's always there. It's like marinating something – you're sitting in a marinade the whole time.\" He has also spoken of dreaming in character while playing John Porter and Thorin Oakenshield. However, recently he rejected the label of \"method actor.\" \"I think I'm a concentrating actor. So in order to do my work in the course of a day, particularly with a character like this I have to concentrate. So it's about staying in the scene, staying with my head in the scene and attempting to keep the character with me. It doesn't mean I can't have a conversation or go and make a cup of coffee. But I actually stay with the character for 18 months.\"\n\nHe frequently speaks of developing and being drawn to dualism in his characters. \"If I'm offered the role of the hero, I immediately look for the antihero within!... I see everything in terms of an outer skin and an inner skin.\" He creates \"character diaries\" with entire biographies for the characters he plays. \"It was important to me to put in a background for my character that would be useful for the whole journey. A lot of that is secret and no one gets to read that. It's what is useful to me. If you are playing something long-running and a role that has a future [beyond the initial series], it's almost like you have to plant a garden which you will need to come back to at some point. If you don't put in early, it can jar with you.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some remains of the church survive.\n\nThe priory was founded in c. 1190 by Robert Fitz-Henry, Lord of Lathom, for Augustinian canons. In 1390 the Lordship of the Manor and lands of Lathom passed to the Stanley family, several of whom were buried in the Priory, notably Sir Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley, K.G., of Lathom and Knowsley, in February 1459, his wife Joan in 1466, and their son Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby.\n\nThe priory was dedicated to St. Nicholas. There was an associated leper hospital. Fitz-Henry endowed it with land in Burscough, the entire adjoining township of Marton, the chapel of St. Leonard of Knowsley, all the mills on his demesne, and the patronage of three parish churches—at Ormskirk, Huyton, and Flixton. The ownership of Flixton however proved problematic. From the 1330s until the dissolution, the vicar of Ormskirk was always one of the canons of the priory. A Royal Charter that was granted by Edward I of England in 1286 to the monks at Burscough Priory permitted a regular market nearby in Ormskirk.\n\nAs a priory with an income of less than £200, it was dissolved under the act of February 1536. At the time of its surrender the religious community consisted of only five canons, including the prior. The Earl of Derby made attempts to save the church, in which many of his family had been buried, but they came to nothing.\n\nFollowing the dissolution eight bells from the Priory were moved to Ormskirk Parish Church, where a tower had to be built specially, as the existing steeple could not support them. The remaining bells were removed to Croston church. The tenor bell at the Ormskirk Church (the third bell from the Priory) has a Latin inscription which translates as \"J.S. de Burscough, Esq., and E. my wife, made [this bell] in honour of the Trinity. R.B. 1497\". It also bears the symbols of the rose, portcullis and Fleur-de-lis which suggests that the bell was presented in honour of a visit from Henry VII as these were some of his favourite badges.\n\nThe Priory gives its name to the local high school, the Burscough Priory Academy, until recently known as the Burscough Priory Science College. The school has an enrolment of around 750 pupils of ages 11–16 years.\n\n\nAccording to a survey of the ruins made in 1886, the church was cruciform in plan with a presbytery (chancel) by , a central tower square; north transept and south transepts, and nave by with a north aisle. On the south side of the nave was a cloister square. The seal used on the surrender deed of the priory shows a view of the monastic buildings.\n\nThe parts still standing above ground consist of the two piers which originally supported the north side of the crossing tower of the church. They survive to some height above the springing of the crossing arches, although the voussoirs of the arches themselves have been removed.\nThere are fragmentary walls projecting from the eastern pier to the north and east, while the other incorporates a small trefoil-headed recess or aumbry. These remains probably date from the late 13th century.\n\n"}

It is dedicated to the improvement of Thoroughbred breeding and racing and fulfills that mandate by serving many segments of the industry through its subsidiary companies and by supporting numerous industry initiatives. \n\nThe Jockey Club, formed on February 9, 1894, is the keeper of the American Stud Book. It came into existence after James R. Keene spearheaded a drive in support of racehorse trainers who had complained about the Board of Control that governed racing in New York State.\n\nOn its formation, The Jockey Club included the existing members of the Board of Control and was overseen by seven appointed stewards. Its twenty-seven founding members included prominent and wealthy sportsmen such as Philip J. Dwyer, John A. Morris, William Kissam Vanderbilt, and William Collins Whitney.\n\nFounding officers:\n\nFounding Stewards:\n\nThe Jockey Club is the registry for all Thoroughbred horses in the United States and Canada, and maintains offices in New York City and Lexington, Kentucky. The Registry maintained by The Jockey Club, called the \"American Stud Book\", dates back to the club's founding and contains the descendants of those horses listed, as well as horses imported into North America up to the present. \n\nParticipants in the Registry program agree to allow the Registry to conduct genetic testing to verify parentage as well as arbitrating any disputes between owners. The Jockey Club has taken the position that it will not allow cloned Thoroughbreds to be registered in the \"American Stud Book\", making it impossible for such horses to compete in most races. The Club has consistently prohibited artificial insemination throughout its history, only allowing the registration of horses born through \"natural\" procreation. \n\nNaming of foals is also controlled by The Jockey Club and includes a number of conventions. Names may not consist of more than 18 letters (with spaces and punctuation marks counting as letters), contain initials such as C.O.D., F.O.B., etc., or end in \"filly,\" \"colt,\" \"stud,\" \"mare,\" \"stallion,\" or any similar horse-related term. Names may also not end with a numerical designation such as \"2nd\" or \"3rd,\" whether or not such a designation is spelled out. Names of persons may not be used unless written permission to use their names is on file (examples of such permission are actor Jack Klugman, whose namesake competed in the Kentucky Derby, and tennis star Chris Evert, whose namesake is in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame). The names of \"notorious\" people may never be used, nor can namesakes of racetracks, races, or stable names. Trademarks and copyrighted names are similarly not allowed as are vulgar, obscene or offensive ones. The list also protects names of currently active horses as well as horses enrolled in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame or other well-known horses, including winners of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup or Breeders' Cup events.\n\nCreated in 1984, The Jockey Club Research Foundation was joined along with the Grayson Foundation, established in 1940 by George D. Widener, Jr., William Woodward, Sr. and John Hay Whitney, amongst others. It is now known as the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation Inc.\n\nThe Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation is the nation’s leading source of equine research funding and it helps all breeds.\n\nThe Jockey Club Safety Net Foundation is a charitable trust that provides, on a confidential basis, financial relief and assistance to needy members of the Thoroughbred industry and their families.\n\nAssistance includes financial aid, medication, surgical and hospital costs, therapeutic equipment, voice-recognition computers for quadriplegics and wheelchair-accessible vans, among other needs.\n\nThe Jockey Club formed the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) in 1998 with the Breeders' Cup Limited, Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, Keeneland Association, Oak Tree Racing Association and the National Thoroughbred Association. The Jockey Club maintains a seat on the Board of Directors of the NTRA.\n\nBelieving the Thoroughbred was the best breed of horse and could pass on its superior traits to other breeds, in 1906 The Jockey Club of New York established the Breeding Bureau. Its purpose was to provide Thoroughbred stallions as sires that would produce a variety of top quality half-breed general purpose horses. \n\nDuring World War I, the Breeding Bureau expanded the part of the program which had been providing horses for the United States Army Cavalry Remount Service. Some of the prominent Thoroughbred runners who were donated to the Cavalry Remount Service include: \n\nSince 1933, the Jockey Club has compiled the Experimental Free Handicap, a weight-based assessment of the previous year's 2-year-olds based on a theoretical race at a distance of 1 / miles.\n\nTJC Media Ventures is a commercial subsidiary of The Jockey Club that oversees the new-fan development activities, primarily under the “America’s Best Racing” (ABR) brand.

{"id": "2296692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296692", "title": "Big Ben (solitaire)", "text": "Big Ben (solitaire)\n\nBig Ben (or known in other solitaire brands as Clock) is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of playing cards mixed together. It is basically a large-scale, two-deck version of Grandfather's Clock and is probably named after Big Ben, the colloquially used nickname for the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster in London.\n\nBefore the start of the game, the following cards are separated from the decks: , , , , , , , , , , , . These cards are used to form a circle arranged like numbers on a clock face with the on the \"9 o' clock\" position, the at the \"12 o' clock\" position, and the at the \"8 o' clock.\" This will be the foundations, or the \"inner circle\" (otherwise known as the \"clock\").\n\nTwelve piles of three cards are then dealt around the inner circle. These piles form the tableau, or the \"outer circle.\" The top cards of the outer circle are available for play to the inner circle or around the outer circle. Building on the outer circle is down by suit, while the foundations in the inner circle are built up by suit until the last card corresponds to its position on the clock (i.e. the should be built up to , for instance). Building is also continuous, with Aces placed over Kings in the inner circle and vice versa in the outer circle.\n\nThe minimum number of cards in each pile in the outer circle is three. A pile containing less than three cards is said to have gaps; an empty pile has three \"gaps,\" a pile having one card has two \"gaps,\" and a pile with two cards has one \"gap.\" As cards are built, \"gaps\" are formed and the only way these are \"filled\" is by dealing cards from the stock. Building on a pile having cards less than three is like \"filling a gap\" from the tableau and is therefore not allowed.\n\nIt is the player's discretion when to fill the \"gaps,\" but when the player decides to do so, one has to fill \"all\" \"gaps,\" i. e. replenish all piles with less than three cards so each of them contains three cards once again. For example, two piles are empty, one pile has one card left, and two piles have two cards left. So the player has to fill a total of 10 gaps. He does this by dealing cards one card per pile at a time clockwise starting from the pile above the \"12 o' clock\" foundation. No building is done until this process is complete. The player can do this as long as there are \"gaps.\"\n\nSometimes, the player cannot make any moves even when all piles contain three cards each. So the player can deal cards from the stock one at a time. Cards that cannot be built either onto the inner or outer circles are placed on the wastepile (as a suggestion, one can place the waste pile at the center of the inner circle for convenience). Again, cards at the wastepile cannot be used to fill \"gaps.\" But once the stock is exhausted, there are no re-deals; the game ends sooner after this or later.\n\nThe game is won when all foundations show cards corresponding to their positions in the clock ( on \"11 o' clock,\" on \"12 o' clock,\" on \"1 o' clock,\" and so on.)\n\n"}

Often known by his \"nom de guerre\" Argala (\"Slim\"), he took part in the so called Operation Ogre, which consisted in the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco, Spain's Prime Minister, in 1973. Five years later, he was in turn assassinated by a car bomb in Anglet, French Basque Country by a group directed by far right members inside the Spanish Navy (including an official of the SECED secret service and another of the Naval military intelligence agency, \"Servicio de Inteligencia Naval\" and the other belonging to the \"Alto Estado Mayor\"). This group reportedly received assistance from people such as former OAS member Jean Pierre Cherid, former Triple A Argentine member José María Boccardo and Italian neofascist Mario Ricci, member of \"Avanguardia Nazionale\".\n\nBeñaran was born in Arrigorriaga, in Biscay, close to the industrialized city of Bilbao, but not far from Arratia, a valley with a typical Basque style of life. His mother, Felicidad Ordeñana Uriarte, was from Arantzazu. She was a Basque speaker, but only spoke Spanish at home. His father Pablo Beñaran Ormazabal was from Arrigorriaga. Though his father was a Basque nationalist, he could not speak Basque, even though his father was a Basque speaker. They had four children: Jose Miguel (1949), Maite (1951), Iñaki (1952) and Pablo (1955).\n\nBeñaran grew up in two very different environments: the Francoist schools he was educated in and his Basque nationalist home. Workers strikes and police repression in the mid-1960s contributed to his concerns about the class system. He began studying Marxist theories at a young age. As Basque nationalism and cultural awareness grew stronger in the 1960s Beñaran enthusiastically participated in Basque language schools, festivals, and other cultural activities. In 1968, he joined the separatist group ETA with some friends. He began studying engineering, but he quit before finishing his studies and began working in a bank. He then began studying human sciences.\n\nIn May 1970, at the age of 21, Beñaran was forced to escape when the police noticed his involvement in ETA activities. He was reluctant to do so as both his parents were ill, with his father eventually dying that same year. He went to Oñati and a family gave him shelter there. He then took the nickname \"Iñaki\", living in various locations over the next few years.\n\nIn 1969, almost all of ETA's directorate board were arrested in Bilbao and Cantabria, and different discussions began inside the organization. At a subsequent meeting held in Itsasu, the organization split into three different groups: ETA V, ETA VI and Celulas Rojas.\n\nAt that time, Argala was member of the organization's cultural branch, the Cultural Front. He did not attend the meeting held in Itsasu, the Itsasu Assembly, and at first he remained with the Cultural Front within ETA VI. In December 1970, the took place. On December 2, ETA V kidnapped the German consul, Behil in Donostia. ETA VI then organized \"Operación Botella\", an operation to break out prisoners. Argala joined the operation, which involved digging tunnels into the prison. While the tunnels managed to reach under the building, they failed to succeed, as they failed to break the prison walls.\n\nArgala joined ETA V in January 1971. They were a small group that made their ideology very clear. Argala helped militants like Txomin Iturbe and Eustakio Mendizabal build a theory based on Marxist theories, while stressing Basque national values. He spent some time in Paris undertaking organizing tasks and then he went back to Biscay as leader of the Cultural Front. He divided his life between the towns of Eibar and Elgoibar. However, the fact that he was involved in the Cultural Front did not keep him from taking part in the Military Front. On 30 September 1971, he participated in the assault of Banco de Vizcaya together with Eustakio Mendizabal and some other members, getting away with 10 million pesetas.\n\nIn 1971, ETA began setting up hideouts in Madrid, where they could contact some other left-wing groups, with a view to establishing an anonymous and safe rearguard and creating a local armed cell in Madrid. Argala made many trips to the Francoist state's capital. They shelved the idea of creating a local armed group in the short term, and instead began to consider staging attacks themselves in Madrid. It was here that Argala made his first contacts with Alfonso Sastre and .\n\nOn 19 January 1972, an ETA group formed by Txomin Iturbe, Mikel Lujua, Tomas Perez Revilla and Argala kidnapped the businessman Lorenzo Zabala Suinaga in Abadiño, Biscay. The workers of the company Precicontrol were on strike, with some of them, including some friends of Argala, on a hunger strike in the church of Eibar. ETA wanted to support labour conditions and turned their attention to the workers' demands. They declared that if the company's management didn't meet their workers' demands, they would kill Zabala on 28 January. The demands were satisfied and Zabala was freed on 22 January.\n\nIn October 1972, ETA V organized an assembly to clarify each faction's position and to try to reunite them as a single organization. The meeting was meant to be in Hasparren, in the Northern Basque Country. Argala and some other members of the Cultural Front, decided not to cross the Spanish-French border out of concern for their own safety. The Guardia Civil had spotted the group Argala was supposed to join and opened fire on them. Jonan Aranguren, known as \"Iharra\", was killed, but the rest of the group managed to escape. Missing a meeting was considered a breach of discipline, so Argala and Ignacio Pérez Beotegui, known as \"Wilson\" were stripped of all responsibilities in the organization. The assembly issued a ban on both militants from setting foot in Southern Basque Country or from undertaking any politically related work. \n\nAs a result of this ban, Argala and Wilson were forced to relocate to Madrid. They obtained information about Luis Carrero Blanco, planning to kidnap him in exchange for the freedom of all imprisoned Basque activists. More militants joined them in Madrid and by May 1973 plans were complete to carry out the kidnapping. Due to various problems, the kidnapping was delayed. Later on the ETA member Eustakio Mendizabal, aka \"Txikia\", was killed in Algorta, forcing the organization's directorate to delay the abduction. From that moment on, the Madrid group was called the \"Commando Txikia\". Carrero Blanco was appointed prime minister of the Spanish government and undertook more security measures. With the difficulties in kidnapping Carrero Blanco Argala's group tried to kidnap the Secretary of Trade Alberto Ullastres, but he was away when a cell formed by ETA members came up in his house on 7 November.\n\nArgala and his group began plotting to kill Carrero Blanco instead, in what would be known as Operación Ogro. The Commando Txikia also considered other options: killing Manuel Fraga, killing Alfredo Semprún and breaching the walls of the Segovia prison to break out anti-Franco prisoners. On 25 September, they attacked a government arms store to obtain explosives, scattering propaganda of an invented revolutionary group as a distraction. On 20 December 1973, posing as workmen, members the cell triggered the bomb that went off in a tunnel under the Madrid street as the car of Carrero Blanco passed by on his way home from Mass. Franco's right-hand man initially survived the attack, though he later died in hospital, while his chauffeur and bodyguard were also killed. Argala was the only ETA member able to identify the mysterious man who gave Carrero Blanco's schedule and itinerary to ETA.\n\nHe was arrested several times in the French Basque Country between 1975 and 1977, and confined to different French regions by French authorities. However, he was released and by 1978 he lived in Anglet. By then Argala was a charismatic leader of ETA (m), with the PNV historic figure Telesforo Monzon calling him in the Txiberta talks, where a possible Basque nationalist collaboration was discussed and eventually ruled out. However, the Spanish home office was targeting him and tracked him down, as declared by mercenaries who were being used to execute the Government's policy in the French Basque Country. Argala was assassinated by a car bomb on 21 December 1978 in the town of Anglet, in the French Basque Country.\n\nAccording to \"Leonidas\", a former member of the Spanish Army involved in the bombing against Argala, \"the explosives came from a North American base. I don't remember exactly whether they were from Torrejón de Ardoz or Rota, but I do know that the Americans did not know what they would be used for. It was a personal favor to Pedro el Marino\" (referring to Pedro Martínez, who provided the explosives). Responsibility for Argala's assassination was claimed by the \"Batallón Vasco Español\" (BVE). According to Leonidas, however, \"BVE, ATE and Triple A are only acronyms\", used to suit each situation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2296721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296721", "title": "Cobra Verde", "text": "Cobra Verde\n\nCobra Verde (also known as Slave Coast) is a 1987 German drama film directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski, in their fifth and final collaboration. It was based upon Bruce Chatwin's 1980 novel \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\". The film depicts the life of a fictional slave trader. It was filmed on location in Brazil, Colombia and Ghana.\n\nIn 1880s, Francisco Manoel da Silva (Klaus Kinski) is a debauched Brazilian rancher who reluctantly goes to work at a gold mining company after his ranch is ruined by drought. When he discovers that he is being financially exploited, he murders his boss and goes on the lam to pursue a career as an outlaw. He becomes the notorious Cobra Verde (Green Snake), the most vicious bandit of the \"sertão\".\n\nIn a visit to town, da Silva encounters and subdues by force of character an escaping slave, an act that impresses wealthy sugar baron Dom Octávio Coutinho (José Lewgoy). Dom Coutinho, unaware that he is dealing with the legendary bandit, hires da Silva to oversee the slaves on his sugar plantation. When da Silva subsequently impregnates all three of the Dom's daughters, the sugar baron is furious, but the situation becomes even more complicated when he discovers that da Silva is none other than the infamous Cobra Verde.\n\nAs punishment, rather than kill him or have him prosecuted, Dom Coutinho decides to send da Silva on the impossible mission of re-opening the slave trade with Western Africa. The bandit is aware he is likely to be killed in Africa, but accepts anyway. He travels by sea to Dahomey, West Africa (present-day Benin), where he must negotiate with the fearsome King Bossa Ahadee of Dahomey (played by His Honour the Omanhene Nana Agyefi Kwame II of Nsein, a village north of the city of Axim, Ghana).\n\nAmazingly, da Silva succeeds in convincing the King to exchange slaves for new rifles. He takes over Elmina Castle and takes Taparica (King Ampaw), sole survivor of the previous expedition, for a partner. They begin operating the slave trade across the Atlantic to Brazil. Soon, however, the fickle king has them captured and brought before him. The King accuses da Silva of various crimes that he has no knowledge of, including poisoning the King's greyhound, and sentences him to death. He and Taparica are rescued the night prior to da Silva's decapitation by the King's nephew, who negotiates a blood alliance with da Silva, planning to overthrow the King. The ambitious bandit trains an enormous army of native women, and leads them on a raid to successfully overthrow King Bossa.\n\nAgainst all expectations, the slave trade is successfully maintained under the new King, thanks to da Silva's resourcefulness. However, da Silva eventually falls out of favour with the new King, and discovers that in the meantime the Portuguese have outlawed slavery and seized his assets, and the English have placed a price on his head. Despite the adversity, da Silva is glad that finally a change has come. The exhausted bandit tries desperately to take a boat to water, but despite his best efforts, he is unable to accomplish the task. He collapses next to the ship as the tide slowly laps in. The film ends with the image of an African man stricken with polio walking along the shore, and a group of young native women laughingly chant over the credits.\n\n\nThe film was shot in Ghana, Brazil and Colombia. Herzog showed Kinski photographs of the places where he would like to work. Kinski was interested in some landscapes in Colombia, but Herzog did not agree. However, Kinski made the trip with a group of friends to some remote places that fascinated him: the foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Cape of the Sailing, on the peninsula of La Guajira, Colombia. Herzog finally decided on Villa de Leyva and Valle del Cauca, in the South American country. Kinski said then: \"Herzog does not know that I give life to the dead scenery\".\n\nThe film was based upon Bruce Chatwin's 1980 novel \"The Viceroy of Ouidah\", which was itself based on the Brazilian slave trader Francisco Félix de Sousa and his role in helping King Ghezo overthrow his brother Adandozan as King of Dahomey with the help of Ghezo's Dahomey Amazons.\n\n\"Cobra Verde\" was the last film that Werner Herzog would make with Klaus Kinski. Their now-legendary personality conflict peaked during the film. The film's production was especially affected by Kinski's fiery outbursts. The cast and crew were continually plagued by Kinski's wrath, most famously culminating in the film's original cinematographer Thomas Mauch walking out on the project after a perpetual torrent of verbal abuse from Kinski. Herzog was forced to replace Mauch with Viktor Růžička.\n\nHerzog's opinions of Kinski are deeply explored in his 1999 documentary retrospective, \"My Best Fiend\", where he examines their unique friendship, the associated hatred, and the legacy that both qualities were responsible for. The filming of \"Cobra Verde\" and relationship of Herzog and Kinski was also the subject of a 1987 Swiss documentary film, \"Location Africa\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2296723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296723", "title": "WHK (AM)", "text": "WHK (AM)\n\nWHK (1420 AM) – branded AM 1420 The Answer – is a commercial news/talk radio station licensed to Cleveland, Ohio, serving primarily Greater Cleveland. WHK was the first radio station to broadcast in Ohio, and is the 15th oldest station still broadcasting in the United States. Currently owned by Salem Media Group, WHK serves as the Cleveland affiliate for the Salem Radio Network. The WHK studios are located in the Cleveland suburb of Independence, while the station transmitter resides in neighboring Seven Hills. WHK also simulcasts over low-power translator W273DG (102.5 FM), and is available online.\n\nWHK received its first broadcasting station license in February 1922. However, the station's history dates back to a series of broadcasts begun in August 1921 over an amateur radio station operated by WHK's original owner, Warren R. Cox.\n\nRadio broadcasting in the United States started to become organized in the fall of 1919, largely due to improvements in vacuum tube design. Many of the earliest programs originated from a mixture of amateur and experimental stations. The amateurs in the Cleveland area were particularly well organized, and in early May 1921 the Cleveland Radio Association announced that its members had inaugurated a weekly Friday evening series of live concerts, transmitted on the standard amateur wavelength of 200 meters (1500 kHz) by a rotating roster of local amateur stations.\nWarren R. Cox made his first contribution to the series on August 26, 1921, operating amateur station 8ACS at 3138 Payne Avenue S. E. This was the location of the Cox Manufacturing Company, which primarily produced electrical components for automotive markets and radio receiver construction. Cox's station was described as \"one of the newer and most powerful in the city\".\n\nThe 8ACS programs were soon recognized as providing \"exceptional wireless entertainment\", and B. Dreher's Sons Company donated a Steinway grand piano for use in the station's studio. In October the Cleveland Radio Association concerts moved to Thursday nights. Around this time Warren R. Cox added his own weekly concerts, on Sunday evenings. In December the Cleveland Radio Association ended the Thursday broadcasts, and switched to exclusively supporting the 8ACS Sunday concerts.\n\nWarren R. Cox's broadcasting activities gained special prominence during local elections held in the fall of 1921. The November 3rd broadcast featured short speeches by six of the city's seven candidates for mayor. In addition, the \"Cleveland Plain Dealer\" made arrangements to relay vote totals on election night by telephone to 8ACS for broadcasting by the station.\n\nInitially there were no specific standards in the United States for radio stations making transmissions intended for the general public, and numerous stations under various classifications made entertainment broadcasts. However, effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, regulators of radio at this time, adopted a regulation that formally created a broadcasting station category, and stations were now required to hold a Limited Commercial license authorizing operation on wavelengths of 360 meters (833 kHz) for \"entertainment\" broadcasts or 485 meters (619 kHz) for \"market and weather reports\". By the end of 1922 over 500 stations would be authorized nationwide.\n\nAt first this new policy was loosely enforced, but in early February 1922 the government's official monitor of radio in the region, S. W. Edwards, contacted the local stations to reiterate that amateurs were no longer permitted to make entertainment broadcasts. Thus, on February 3 Edwin H. Poad, president of the Cleveland Radio Association, announced that his organization was ending the weekly broadcasts started nine months earlier. This ban also ended the broadcasts over 8ACS, however it was soon reported that Warren R. Cox was making plans to apply for one of the new broadcasting station licenses in order to return to the airwaves.\n\nWHK was issued its first broadcasting station license on February 21, 1922, for operation on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength, with Warren R. Cox listed as the licensee. (Prior to April 4, 1922 the Commerce Department issued three-letter call signs to most commercial radio stations. The WHK call letters were randomly chosen and did not have any particular meaning.) According to one analysis, WHK was the second broadcasting station license issued for Ohio, and the 52nd in the United States, and is Ohio's oldest surviving radio station, and 15th in the country.\n\nThe station began broadcasting from the Radiovox Company, which was located at the Stuyvesant Building on 5005 Euclid Avenue. WHK's debut broadcast, on Sunday night March 5, 1922, was advertised as a continuation of the suspended Cleveland Radio Association weekly concert series. Cox announced that, in addition to the Sunday schedule, he planned to broadcast Tuesday night concerts in conjunction with the Keith vaudeville organization, with additional programs on Thursday nights. In July 1922 the station's transmitting power was reported to be 200 watts. Later in the year the licensee name was changed to \"Radiovox Company (Warren R. Cox)\".\nIn May 1923 the U.S. government made additional broadcasting station transmitting frequencies available. In late 1923 WHK was reassigned to 1060 kHz, which was followed by moves to 1100 kHz in early 1925 and 1130 kHz in 1927.\n\nWHK was sold to the Radio Air Service Corporation in October 1925. In the following years, the station facilities underwent a series of moves, including 5105 Euclid Avenue, the Hotel Winton at 1010 Prospect Avenue (later the Hotel Carter), the Standard Building at St. Clair and Ontario, the top floor of the Higbee Company on Public Square, and Carnegie Hall at 1220 Huron Road. By 1928, the station was located in the Engineers' Building at 1370 Ontario Street.\n\nOn November 11, 1928, under the provisions of a major reallocation resulting from the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, WHK was reassigned to 1390 kHz. WHK became a CBS affiliate in 1930 and increased its power to 5,000 watts full-time. On March 9, 1931, the station moved to the Terminal Tower, and celebrated with the live broadcast of Faust from its auditorium. As of January 1, 1934 WHK was broadcasting with a daytime power of 2,500 watts and a nighttime power of 1,000 watts. The station broadcast a full season of Cleveland Indians baseball games in 1936, with announcers Jack Graney and Pinky Hunter.\n\nIn 1939 the Radio Air Service Corporation sold WHK to the United Broadcasting Company, which also purchased WCLE (now WHLO, Akron), a station that had been broadcasting in Cleveland since January 5, 1927 and was currently transmitting on 610 kHz. WCLE's studios were relocated to the Terminal Tower to join WHK, and the two stations were placed under common management. WHK switched its network affiliation in 1937 from CBS to the NBC Blue Network plus the Mutual Broadcasting System, which had started three years earlier. In the 1940s WHK, like most Mutual affiliates, became a participant in network programming. \"Rhythm and Rhyme Time\" was a Saturday night band concert on Mutual that originated from the Terrace Room of the Statler Hotel through the WHK's facilities. In 1943, when the NBC Blue Network was sold to Edward Noble to eventually become ABC, the Blue Network switched its Cleveland affiliate from WHK to WJW, leaving WHK with just Mutual. The Mutual network brought its popular \"Queen for a Day\" program to Cleveland Music Hall on April 5, 1946 for a two days of broadcast with local contestants chosen by WHK.\n\nOn March 29, 1941, WHK, along with all the other stations on 1390 kHz, moved to 1420 kHz, the frequency it still occupies, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. In 1945 as the FCC began enforcing a rule limiting owners to a single AM station in a market, United Broadcasting moved WCLE out of Cleveland to Akron and changed its call sign to WHKK and its frequency to 640 kHz. (WHKK became WHLO in 1962.) This in turn meant United could now use the vacated 610 frequency in Columbus, where it was assigned to WHKC, which had been broadcasting daytime-only on 640. (WHKC became WTVN in the 1950s).\n\nIn August 1946 WHK received an experimental FM license, W8XUB, transmitting at 107.1 MHz. The station became WHK-FM at 100.7 MHz upon receipt of a commercial license, becoming WMMS in 1968.\n\nWHK also obtained a construction permit for television station WHK-TV on Channel 19, but this never made it on the air, due to the financial challenge of the time of launching a UHF station in a VHF market such as Cleveland. Ironically, the channel 19 position was later occupied by WOIO, which was purchased in 1985 by WHK's eventual owner, Malrite Communications.\n\nWHK moved its studios in 1951 to 5000 Euclid Avenue, across the street from its first studio location, which it would occupy for 26 years. (This is presently the site of the Agora Theatre and Ballroom and Lava Room Recording.) In 1955, ownership was transferred to the Forest City Publishing Company, the parent company of \"\"The Cleveland Plain Dealer\". In May 1957, as part of the station's 35th anniversary celebration, WHK honored founder Warren R. Cox with \"a small transistor radio and a plaque\".\n\nWHK was sold in 1958 to Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation, which became Metromedia two years later. The new owners soon adopted a rock and roll Top 40 format. Morning man Ernie Anderson was let go because he did not fit into the new format. Ironically, Anderson would later find local fame with his Ghoulardi character that would have been ideally suited as an early rock disk jockey. Pete \"Mad Daddy\" Myers, another early iconic rock DJ, was lured away from rival WJW for a successful stint in WHK's early rock-and-roll years, before he left for New York.\nBy the early 1960s WHK was Top 40 powerhouse, adopting the slogan \"Color Radio\" and \"Color Channel 14.\" The station soared with fast-talking deejays like Johnny Holliday, who broadcast from \"the glass cage\" at 5000 Euclid, and dubbed the station's echo-chamber reverberation its \"stratophonic sound.\" The \"Action Central\" newsroom included young reporters Tim Taylor and Dave Buckel. When The Beatles made one of their North American tours in 1964, WHK outmaneuvered rival KYW to sponsor the Beatles appearance at Cleveland Public Auditorium on September 15, 1964. The station offered free tickets to listeners with an on-air promotion; the winners were selected in what is believed to be the first automated audience selection. Those receiving tickets were selected by an IBM computer. In the mid-1960s, the WHK DJs adopted the name the \"Good Guys\" and included Joe Mayer. On the cover of The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper album, a doll wears a sweater emblazoned with \"Welcome The Rolling Stones\" and \"Good Guys\", a possible reference to the WHK DJs.\n\nLate in 1967, WHK stopped rocking to become \"The Good Life Station,\" with easy-listening music and phone-in shows aimed at older listeners. Possibly the biggest reason for the format change at WHK, was the pressure put on the station by newcomer WIXY, an AM station at 1260 which started playing top 40 music in 1966.\n\nIn 1968 the FCC mandated that FM sister stations could no longer duplicate their AM sister's programming, and WHK-FM adopted a new progressive rock sound, one of a handful of commercial stations in the country to try that format. The callsign of WHK-FM was changed to WMMS on September 28, 1968.\n\nFrom 1968 through 1984, WHK was the flagship station of the Cleveland Browns radio network. Gib Shanley provided play-by-play commentary for the majority of the Browns' run at WHK; he was succeeded by Nev Chandler. Color commentary duties were first held by Jim Graner, then Jim Mueller, and finally Doug Dieken, who continues in that position to this day.\n\nMetromedia sold WHK and WMMS in 1972 to Malrite Broadcasting of Ohio (later Malrite Communications), and Malrite moved its headquarters to Cleveland. WHK dropped the beautiful music and tried a modified Top 40 format briefly again in 1973, called Cover Hits and developed by consultant Mike Joseph. The station ended up settling on a country music format in 1974 featuring controversial morning show talk host Gary Dee and famed Cleveland disk jockey Joe Finan as the \"housewife's friend\" from 10 am to 2 pm, until the eventual format change in '84.\n\nAnother notorious personality, Don Imus, who had a morning show on WGAR for 1½ years ending in 1971, returned to Cleveland in 1978 to do afternoon drivetime on WHK, one of the few times he would host a non-morning timeslot. Imus stayed at WHK until September 1979, when he returned to WNBC in New York.\n\nOn February 14, 1977, WHK and WMMS moved their studios from 5000 Euclid Avenue to the Statler Office Tower near Playhouse Square, after WGAR, which had signed on there in December 1930, relocated to its suburban transmitter site in Broadview Heights.\n\nWHK began programming nostalgic 1950s and '60s Top 40s music on April 24, 1984, becoming Cleveland's first totally formatted \"oldies\" station. The station incorporated its dial position, 1420 AM, in the slogan \"14K WHK Solid Gold. Prior to the format change, long time morning man, Gary Dee, was relocated to Malrite's sister station in Washington, D.C., and newly hired Program Director Bill Stedman, who was brought in (from WLW/Cincinnati) with a new DJ lineup that consisted of Chip Binder from cross-town rival WGAR (6am-10am), Dennis Day from WDRQ/Detroit (10am-3pm), John E. Douglas from WIBC/Indianapolis (3pm-7pm), and Bill Schiel (7pm-midnight). Others that would grace the format until it ended in November 1988 were Bernie Kimble (who went on to program the highly popular jazz-formatted Cleveland/Elyria based WNWV), Al Wynter (from WHB/Kansas City), Barbara Lincoln, Vickie Sue Winston and JD Harlan. Bill Garcia (who went to WUSN, WLS Chicago). The oldies format lasted until December 1988, when WHK switched to a news/talk format aimed heavy on business news using the name \"AllNewsPlus.\" Even still, the \"14K\" format was partly the inspiration for WMJI's conversion into a full-time rock-and-roll oldies outlet in 1990.\n\nIn 1992, studios were moved to the Skylight Office Tower, and on August 10, 1992, popular talk show hosts Merle Pollis and Joel Rose left WERE and joined WHK, but weren't there for long.\n\nUnable to service its growing debt, Malrite exited the radio business by selling off all their stations to Shamrock Broadcasting (Roy Disney's family-owned broadcasting company) in 1993.\n\nShamrock in turn spun off WHK and WMMS to OmniAmerica, headed by former Malrite executive Carl Hirsch, in April 1994. Shortly thereafter, on May 16, 1994, WHK adopted a sports talk format featuring Tom Bush, Les Levine, Tony Rizzo and Pat McCabe, and dubbed itself \"The Sports Voice of the Fan.\" WHK's programming was highly regarded by many listeners, and it slowly developed a devoted following. In its latter days under this format, WHK simulcast sister station WMJI's \"Lanigan, Webster and Malone\" show in morning drive.\n\nIn 1996, WHK was sold to Salem Communications, while longtime sister station WMMS was sold to Nationwide Communications – the first time ever the two stations operated under separate ownership. In August 1997, Salem Communications eliminated all local programming during the transition, and adopted a religious format as \"The Word\" – the new programming was simulcast over Akron-Canton area radio station , itself formerly WTOF-FM. The WHK studios were moved to Independence, joined by Akron's WHLO and Parma's WCCD. Nationally syndicated area pastor Alistair Begg aired daily on both WHK and WHK-FM. In October 1997, both stations broadcast live from the \"Stand in the Gap\" rally held by Promise Keepers.\n\nOn July 3, 2001, WHK was one of seven Northeast Ohio radio stations involved in a complex exchange between three radio companies. Although generally reported as a \"frequency swap\", in reality these seven radio stations mostly traded callsigns along with their respective formats and staffs – all to facilitate the transfers of ownership of four of the seven stations. As part of this complex exchange, Salem Communications sold WHK to Radio Seaway; both companies retained their respective on- and off-air staff. Radio Seaway then changed the WHK callsign to WCLV; and changed the station's format.\n\nRadio Seaway's original intent for was to simulcast the classical programming from . Instead, picked up the adult standards format previously heard on WRMR (850 AM) – this was done in response to a significant outcry from loyal listeners faced with losing the adult standards format. Radio Seaway acquired the intellectual programming and music library of from Salem for an undisclosed amount. Jim Davis – who again both programmed and assumed on-air duties – along with Ted Hallaman, Carl Reese, Bill Rudman and eventually John Simna, Bill Randle and Ted Alexander hosted music shows.\n\nThe long-running \"Irish Hour with Gerry Quinn\", a staple, also made the move to on Sunday mornings. news director Hugh Danaceau also did live drive-time newscasts on the AM station until his death in 2003. Many of WCLV-FM's long-running specialty shows, including \"Weekend Radio\", the City Club of Cleveland's weekly forum, and \"Footlight Parade\" were also aired. \"Footlight Parade\" host Bill Rudman also would helm the Saturday afternoon shift on the AM station up until its 2004 signoff.\n\nOther radio shows brought included \"When Radio Was\", \"The Twilight Zone\" with Stacy Keach, and \"American Standards by the Sea\" with Dick Robinson. The station also boasted two syndicated shows spotlighting Frank Sinatra: \"Sounds of Sinatra\" with Sid Mark, and \"Frank and Friends\" with Joe Raposa. It was briefly affiliated with the CBS Radio Network before signing with AP Radio News.\n\nThe 1420-AM facility was initially branded \"WCLV Classic Pops 1420-AM\", with an emphasis on songs and showtunes from the 1930s and 1940s, in an attempt to make the format hold a more sophisticated sound along the lines of WCLV-FM's classical format. On January 1, 2003, the call letters were changed to WRMR – a move to reinforce the station format's link to WRMR (850 AM).\nRebranded as \"The Songs You Love\", WRMR's music programming reverted to the adult standards format, again placing an emphasis on pop music and contemporary ballads from the 1950s and 1960s. In November 2003, WRMR's lineup significantly changed: Ted Alexander replaced Ted Hallaman in the morning slot, WCLV staffer John Simna assumed the mid-morning slot, and Jim Davis and Carl Reese were moved to the afternoon and evening slots, respectively. Despite these changes, WRMR still experienced a loss in listenership and advertising revenue so significant that Radio Seaway opted to sell the station back to Salem Communications on July 6, 2004 for $10 million.\n\nThe permanent sign-off of WRMR was made more poignant just days later after the death of signature WRMR personality Bill Randle, on July 11, 2004. The final day of programming on WRMR was punctuated with the final installment of a long-running music program hosted by Randle that had been pre-recorded just days earlier. Carl Reese hosted the final air shift from 7 pm until sign-off at midnight; fittingly, he was also one of the first voices heard on WRMR (850 AM) when it signed on back in June 1985.\n\nWith the sale announcement, Salem changed the station's format to conservative talk programmed mostly by the Salem Radio Network as NewsTalk 1420 WHK, but the WRMR callsign would stay until April 5, 2005, when WHK (1220 AM) changed call letters to WHKZ (and ultimately to WHKW), allowing the WHK callsign to be restored on this facility. Small reminders of WRMR remain on the station, such as \"Gerry Quinn Irish Radio\". WHK's transmitter facility, heavily renovated under WCLV/WRMR ownership, has been in Seven Hills, Ohio since 1937, and still contains many historical artifacts from previous decades.\n\nOn April 15, 2013, WHK was rebranded AM 1420 The Answer, which is the slogan used by most Salem news/talk stations.\n\nThe Salem Radio Network provides most of the station's weekday programming, with shows hosted by Hugh Hewitt (morning drive), Mike Gallagher (late mornings with a late evening replay), Dennis Prager (middays), Sebastian Gorka (afternoons), Jay Sekulow (evenings), Larry Elder (evenings), and Eric Metaxas (late nights). Other national weekday programming includes Bloomberg Radio overnight. Local program \"The Bob Frantz Authority\" with Cleveland radio personality Bob Frantz, who joined WHK in 2015, airs late mornings. WHK also airs Bill O'Reilly's daily commentaries weekday afternoons.\n\nLocal weekend programming includes Sunday features such as \"Inside the Great Outdoors\" hosted by Joe \"Kastaway\" Kulis, \"Gerry Quinn's Irish Radio\" hosted by Gerry Quinn, Ed Fitzpatrick, and Colleen Corrigan-Day, and \"Kelly and Company\" hosted by Tom Kelly.\n\nSports play-by-play programming on WHK includes being the flagship station for Cleveland State Vikings men's basketball (shared with sister station WHKW), and the Cleveland affiliate for University of Akron football.\n"}

McCaffery (born June 3, 1950) is an American retired Justice on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Prior to his election to the Supreme Court, he was a judge on the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, and prior to that was a municipal court judge in Philadelphia. He was the judge at \"Eagles Court\", an \"ad hoc\" court created to deal with unruly fans at Philadelphia Eagles games.\n\nMcCaffery was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1950. His family emigrated to the United States when he was five. He graduated from Cardinal Dougherty High School in Philadelphia and joined the United States Marine Corps.\n\nAfter leaving active duty, McCaffery joined the Marine Corps Reserve and joined the Philadelphia Police Department. He served in the police department for 20 years, rising to sergeant. While a police officer, McCaffery put himself through university at La Salle University and law school at Temple University. He became a member of the Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. bars and worked as a litigation associate.\n\nIn 2008 he retired as a colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He is also a 33° Mason.\n\nIn 1993, McCaffery won election to Municipal Court in Philadelphia. With support from members of the city council, he developed Eagles Court in 1998 in response to a 1997 Monday Night Football game between the Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. With over 60 fistfights reported at the nationally televised game, stadium violence became an embarrassment for the city. McCaffery presided over the court, which was convened in the basement of Veterans Stadium, and handed out fines or jail time to fans arrested during games.\nPrior to protests at the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, McCaffery announced a plan for the preventive detention of protesters. Because of this, defense attorneys asked him to recuse himself from trials involving the protests, but he refused, without hearing the arguments. \nHe was elected to the Superior Court in 2003 and successfully ran for the Supreme Court in 2007, where he was a landslide winner attaining over 2 million votes statewide.\n\nMcCaffery abruptly resigned from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on October 27, 2014, one week after his October 20, 2014 suspension by four fellow Justices and the public disclosure by Chief Justice Ronald Castille that Justice McCaffery had sent or received 234 emails containing pornography between late 2008 and May 2012 to an agent in the attorney general's office. The Chief Justice had requested copies of the emails from Attorney General Kathleen Kane.\n\nA fellow justice, Michael Eakin, (who abstained from the suspension vote) also had gone public with an accusation he filed on October 17, 2014, that Justice McCaffery tried to coerce him into taking his side against Chief Justice Castille. The justices voting to suspend McCaffery cited King's Bench power to \"protect and preserve the integrity\" of the state's judicial system. The justices, in their order suspending McCaffery, directed the state Judicial Conduct Board, which was already investigating McCaffery, to determine within 30 days whether there was \"probable cause to file formal misconduct charges\" against him.\n\nThe court said McCaffery may also have allowed his wife, who was his chief legal clerk, to collect legal referral fees while she was a state court employee, and he may have tried to fix a traffic ticket for her. In his concurring statement on the suspension, Chief Justice Castille described McCaffery as exhibiting the traits of a sociopath. \nThe Supreme Court confirmed McCaffery's resignation in an order lifting his suspension. McCaffery's retirement agreement not to seek senior judge status and not seek future judicial positions ended the state Judicial Conduct Board investigation of him. By retiring instead of being impeached, McCaffery was able to keep an $11,000 per month retirement benefit ($134,000 annual pension) from the State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) paid for by Pennsylvania taxpayers, even after he cashed out $455,000 of his own contributions plus interest.\n\n\n"}

Before they officially changed their name on 20 January 2013, they were previously known as the Singapore Armed Forces Football Club (SAFFC) since their establishment on 16 February 1996. Despite their name back then, membership of the Armed Forces was not a prerequisite for players representing the team, and several international players have played for them.\n\nUsing a rhino as club mascot was their second suggestion after the S.League rejected their initial proposal of having a warrior as being out of line with the policy of clubs having animal mascots.\n\nWarriors F.C. is currently the most successful club in the history of the S.League, having won the title a record nine times: in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2014 and finishing second in 4 seasons: 1996, 1999, 2001, 2005 in the 22 years since the inception of the S.League.\n\nThe Warriors was based in Jurong Stadium till 2000 before moving to their home ground Choa Chu Kang Stadium in 2001. In light of the preparation of the 2015 SEA Games, the Warriors had to vacate Choa Chu Kang Stadium and will instead play their home matches at the Woodlands Stadium for the 2015 season instead. Warriors will move to their Jurong East Stadium in 2019 season and shared with Albirex Niigata Singapore FC.\n\nThe Singapore Armed Forces Sports Association (SAFSA) football team was formed in 1975 to provide talented footballers serving National Service with opportunities to play competitive football. That year, they won the President's Cup, a feat they repeated in 1978, when they also captured the National Football League title to complete The Double. Their Under-19 team won the national Under-19 title in 1979, 1980 and 1983, while the 1981 season of the National Football League saw the SAFSA football team emerge as champions without losing a game. The President's Cup was captured again in 1984 and 1986, the latter time as part of a second Double, as they also won the National Football League on goal difference. In 1990, the Pools Cup went to the SAFSA football team and their convincing displays led to their selection as one of eight clubs to compete in the newly formed S.League.\n\nSingapore Armed Forces FC's entry into the S.League in 1996 also resulted in the withdrawal of SAFSA from the NFL. SAFSA would not participate in the local football leagues again till 1999, when they rejoined the National Football League.\n\nSAFFC finished second in 1996, 1999 and won the league in 1997 and 1998.\n\nFormer Singapore international Fandi Ahmad took over from Mladen Pralija in 1999.\n\nThree coaches were at the reins during this period, each lasting only one season. SAFFC finished second in 2005 but otherwise outside the top two.\n\nRichard Bok took over as club head coach in 2006 & led the Warriors to 4 consecutive championship 2006, 2007, 2008 & 2009.\n\nIn 2008, Armed Forces became the first Singapore club to achieve the \"double\" back-to-back, after winning both the S.League and the Singapore Cup in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn Asian Football Confederation Club competition, he led Armed Forces to 2 Quarter Finals in 2007 & 2008. In 2009, Armed Forces qualified into the AFC Champions League group stage by defeating Thai Champion PEA FC and PSMS Medan of Indonesia in the East playoff thus Armed Forces making Singapore football history by being the first club from Singapore to qualified for the highest club competition in Asia.\nArmed Forces were drawn in a group with J.League champions Kashima Antlers, K.League champions Suwon Samsung Bluewings and Chinese Super League runners-up Shanghai Shenhua, and despite being confirmed as the group losers after a 5–0 loss to Kashima Antlers in Japan, they won their first ever point in the competition with a 1–1 draw against Shanghai Shenhua at home.\n\nIn 2010, Armed Forces qualified for their second consecutive AFC Champions League group stage by defeating Sriwijaya of Indonesia 3–0 at Jalan Besar stadium in Singapore and won on penalty in the East playoff Final with Muangthong United F.C. of Thailand in Singapore. Armed Forces were group with former Champion Gamba Osaka of Japan, Henan Jianye of China and again Suwon Samsung Bluewings of Korea. Armed Forces got their first ever away points with a draw against Chinese Super League side Henan Jianye in Henan, China. Thus equalling their 1 point in 2009. In the return leg on 13 April 2010 at Jalan Besar stadium in Singapore, Armed Forces record their first ever historical AFC Champions League win with a 2–1 victory over Henan Jianye. Eventually finishing 3rd in the group ahead of Chinese Super League team Henan Jianye putting Armed Forces and Singapore football on the map in Asia Football.\n\nOn 20 January 2013, Armed Forces announced that they had changed their name to Warriors Football Club ahead of the 2013 S.League season.\n\nAlex Weaver, in his first full season as coach of Warriors FC, clinched the 2014 S.League title on the last day of the competition for the Warriors. With Brunei DPMM leading the table until the last day, the Warriors scored a 1–0 win over Albirex Niigata Singapore FC and they received a favour from Tampines Rovers FC, who beat Brunei DPMM FC 2–1 to hand Warriors FC their first title in 5 years and their 9th title in the league's 19 years history.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Maldonado Jr. (born August 21, 1967) is an American politician who served as the 48th Lieutenant Governor of California from April 27, 2010 to January 10, 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nElected to the Santa Maria City Council in 1994, Maldonado then served as Mayor of Santa Maria from 1996 to 1998, when he was elected to the California State Assembly. He served in that body from 1998 to 2004 and then in the California State Senate from 2004 to 2010, running unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for California State Controller in 2006. Maldonado was the first Republican in the State Senate to vote for the budget during the budget deadlock in 2007. He represented a swing district in the Senate and is considered a moderate.\n\nOn November 23, 2009, then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced Maldonado as his nominee for lieutenant governor to fill the vacancy created by Democrat John Garamendi's election to the United States House of Representatives. Maldonado was sworn into office on April 27, 2010 and was defeated in the 2010 lieutenant gubernatorial election by Democrat Gavin Newsom.\n\nMaldonado ran for California's 24th congressional district in the 2012 elections, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Lois Capps. In May 2013, he announced that he was running for governor in the 2014 election, but dropped out in January 2014 after anaemic fundraising and campaign missteps.\n\nMaldonado was born in Santa Maria, California, the eldest son of immigrant Mexican farm workers. His family eventually acquired a small family farm, where they grew strawberries. After Maldonado graduated from Santa Maria High School, his family used their earnings from the farm to send him to California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, where he studied Crop Science, but dropped out before completing his degree. Maldonado brought his college experience back to his family's farm and helped his family grow the half-acre strawberry farm into a 6,000-acre (24 km²) farm, employing 250 people, with produce shipped around the world. He is married to Laura Maldonado and has four children.\n\nAfter months of attempting to obtain a building permit from the City of Santa Maria to construct a cooling facility on the farm, Maldonado grew disillusioned with the city bureaucracy and decided to run for the Santa Maria City Council in 1994 at the age of 26. In 1996, at the age of 28, Councilman Maldonado successfully ran for mayor, defeating the incumbent Mayor Robert Gordon Bunch and retiree George Hobbs 40%-39%-21%, a margin of 70 votes.\n\nIn 1998, at the age of 31, Mayor Maldonado was elected to the California State Assembly with 60% of the vote in the 33rd District, representing San Luis Obispo County and western Santa Barbara County. Maldonado was re-elected in 2000 with 65% of the vote and in 2002 with 63% of the vote.\n\nDuring his Assembly tenure, Abel was named \"Hero of the Taxpayer\" by the Americans for tax reform. He led issues such as seat belts in school buses and California Workers Compensation Reform.\n\nHe was on the Business and Professions committee.\n\nIn 2004, Maldonado was elected to the California State Senate by a margin of 53% to 43% over his Democratic opponent, San Luis Obispo County Supervisor Peg Pinard, in a district evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. The 15th District included San Luis Obispo County, most of Monterey County, eastern Santa Cruz County, portions of northwestern Santa Barbara County, and portions of southwestern Santa Clara County.\n\nIn March 2005, a San Luis Obispo weekly newspaper revealed that Maldonado had received $30,987 in gifts from an organization representing California's power industry. Those gifts included multiple trips to Australia, Africa and Europe. The story suggested that the gifts might have motivated Maldonado to object to a seismic safety bill that could potentially have threatened Diablo Canyon Power Plant's license to operate. According to the story, Maldonado snapped at the reporter, \"“I have never, ever, ever connected monetary resources with a bill or a special company in my area. For somebody to even suggest that is disappointing.\"\n\nMaldonado signed a \"No New Taxes\" pledge before his election which he later claimed to regret as he cast a vote for higher taxes.\n\nIn February 2009, Maldonado was initially among the Republican senators rejecting a series of bills designed to close the $41 billion state budget deficit, but he later joined the Democrats in supporting the measures.\n\nA committee indicated that it might pursue a recall campaign against Maldonado because of his vote on the budget. The same threat was made against other Republicans in the \"Sacramento Six\", but none of the recall campaigns came to anything. (Most of the recall energy was directed against Anthony Adams.)\n\nIn response to his critics, including Steve Poizner, Maldonado said, \"Since the budget was passed, you have gone around the state criticizing it and the role six Republicans played in its passage. Your recent statements condemning Propositions 1A-1F are very frustrating. During the budget debate, which lasted over 100 days, I heard from thousands of Californians who took the time to give me their input on the state budget. But I never heard from you.\"\n\nIn December 2006, he was named Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n\n\nIn 2005, Maldonado declared his candidacy for the office of California State Controller after Controller Steve Westly decided to run for Governor. Maldonado was defeated in the June 6, 2006 Republican primary by Tony Strickland.\n\nFollowing his loss, Maldonado publicly criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for not supporting his campaign more forcefully, suggesting that Schwarzenegger doesn't care about Hispanics, when he told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"[w]hen [Schwarzenegger] needs Latinos, Latinos are always there for him. When Latinos need him, the answer's been no.\" Maldonado issued a public apology for the comment. He also maintained that he would not run for any further political office after his state Senate service; he was re-elected to the Senate in 2008 with 63% of the vote.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi resigned to take a seat in Congress. On the November 23, 2009, episode of \"The Jay Leno Show\", Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced that he was nominating Maldonado as lieutenant governor. Schwarzenegger cited Maldonado's \"bipartisanship and postpartisanship...He makes decisions based on what's best for the people rather than what's best for the party. He has helped us, many times, pass a budget, which was very important. And he comes from an immigrant family...\"\n\nMaldonado needed to be confirmed by a majority vote of the State Senate and a majority vote of the State Assembly within 90 days of the nomination in order to take office as lieutenant governor. In a statement released by the Governor's office, Schwarzenegger called Maldonado a \"true partner\" and cited his willingness \"to reach across the partisan divide\" and \"commitment to creating a transparent, accountable government\" in California.\n\nOn February 11, 2010, Maldonado was confirmed as lieutenant governor by the state Senate by a 26-7 vote. However, his nomination was not approved by the State Assembly. Needing 41 votes (in the 80-seat Assembly) for confirmation in the lower chamber, he received 37 votes in favor, with 35 votes against.\n\nBased upon the vote in the Legislature, Governor Schwarzenegger considered having Maldonado sworn into office, which may have set up a legal battle with Democrats. Instead, Schwarzenegger resubmitted the nomination of Maldonado on February 17. Maldonado received confirmation from the Assembly on April 22, 2010 by a 53-21 vote and from the Senate on April 26, 2010 by a 25-7 vote. He was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor on April 27, 2010.\n\nHe ran for the Republican nomination for the office in June and won with 43.4% of the vote. Maldonado was defeated on November 2, 2010 by Democratic San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn 2011, Maldonado announced his intention to challenge U.S. Representative Lois Capps, a Democrat, for her seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2012 elections.\n\nMaldonado was defeated by Capps in the election by a 55.2% to 44.8% margin.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, Maldonado announced he would seek the Republican nomination for the 2014 California gubernatorial election.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, Maldonado came out in support of the Supreme Court's ruling that cleared the way for same-sex marriage in California, and said that same-sex couples should be afforded the same rights and protections as heterosexual couples. Although Maldonado had supported Proposition 8 in 2008, he reversed his position in 2011 when a cousin revealed that he was gay. He also said his four children helped change his position.\n\nMaldonado withdrew from the race on January 16, 2014. His campaign was beset by problems: he accused Governor Brown of things that occurred years before he was elected, he struggled to raise money, his campaign's senior staff left in September 2013, and his campaign failed to gain traction after the entry of fellow Republicans Tim Donnelly and Neel Kashkari into the race. In announcing his withdrawal, Maldonado said: \"Now is not my time... I know it's cliché to say I am not running so I can spend more time with my family. Everybody says that. But the truth is, that is, a major factor in my decision today. I have missed some birthdays, family holidays and even anniversaries. From this day forward [my wife] now controls my schedule.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2296754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296754", "title": "Mayanism", "text": "Mayanism\n\nMayanism is a non-codified eclectic collection of New Age beliefs, influenced in part by Pre-Columbian Maya mythology and some folk beliefs of the modern Maya peoples. Adherents of this belief system are not to be confused with Mayanists, scholars who research the historical Maya civilization.\n\nContemporary Mayanism places less emphasis on contacts between the ancient Maya and lost lands than in the work of early writers such as Godfrey Higgins, Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg and Augustus Le Plongeon, alluding instead to possible contacts with extraterrestrial life. However, it continues to include references to Atlantis. Notions about extraterrestrial influence on the Maya can be traced to the book \"Chariots of the Gods?\" by Erich von Däniken, whose ancient astronaut theories were in turn influenced by the work of Peter Kolosimo and especially the team of Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels, authors of \"Le Matin des magiciens\". These latter writers were inspired by the fantasy literature of H. P. Lovecraft and publications by Charles Fort. However, there remain elements of fascination with lost continents and lost civilizations, especially as popularized by 19th century science fiction and speculative fiction by authors such as Jules Verne, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and H. Rider Haggard.\n\nMayanism experienced a revival in the 1970s through the work of Frank Waters, a writer on the subject of Hopi mythology. His \"Book of the Hopi\" is rejected \"as largely ersatz by Hopi traditionalists\". In 1970, Waters was the recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation grant to support research in Mexico and Central America. This resulted in his 1975 book \"Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness,\" a discussion of Mesoamerican culture strongly colored by Waters' beliefs in astrology, prophecy, and the lost continent of Atlantis. It has gained new momentum in the context of the 2012 phenomenon, especially as presented in the work of New Age author John Major Jenkins, who asserts that Mayanism is \"the essential core ideas or teachings of Maya religion and philosophy\" in his 2009 book \"The 2012 Story: The Myths, Fallacies, and Truth Behind the Most Intriguing Date in History.\"\n\nMayanism has gained renewed vigor due to pseudoscientific nonfiction by authors such as Erich von Däniken, Zecharia Sitchin, and Graham Hancock, whose theories range from invoking ancient astronauts and other extraterrestrials from outer space to revivals of the idea that ancient peoples from lost lands brought wisdom and technology to the Mayas. The implication of this is that the Mayas had access to aspects of ancient knowledge, spiritualism, philosophy, and religion that are useful for coping with the modern world, whether by avoiding Armageddon, embracing a mystical Apocalypse, or constructing a future Utopia.\n\nMayanism has a complex history that draws from many different sources on the fringes of mainstream archaeology. It has gained growing attention through its influence on popular culture through pulp fiction, science fiction, fantasy literature, and more recently cinema, graphic novels, fantasy role-playing games (especially Dungeons & Dragons), and video games. It has also drawn inspiration from the success of \"The Celestine Prophecy\" by James Redfield, a novel that refers to the fictional discovery of a Pre-Columbian self-help manuscript in South America.\n\nMayanism has been promoted by specific publishing houses, most notably Inner Traditions - Bear & Company, which has produced a number of books on the theme of 2012 by authors such as José Argüelles, John Major Jenkins, Carl Johan Calleman, and Barbara Hand Clow. Jeremy P. Tarcher, Inc. has published works by New Age authors Daniel Pinchbeck and John Major Jenkins that have further contributed to a growing interest in Mayanism.\n\nMayanism can be traced to sources such as the sixteenth-century book \"Utopia\" by Sir Thomas More, who developed the concept of a utopia in the New World (an idea first explored by Christopher Columbus in his 1501 Book of Prophecies). During the eighteenth century, speculations about the origins of ancient Maya civilization sought to associate Maya history with Biblical stories of Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, and the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. This included speculation about legendary culture heroes such as Votan and Quetzalcoatl.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, Alexander von Humboldt and Lord Kingsborough contributed further to such speculation. Humboldt and Kingsborough were in turn cited by Godfrey Higgins, whose \"Anacalypsis\" (1833) contributed to the emergence of perennial philosophy and claims that all religions had a common, ancient origin in a Golden Age of the distant past.\n\nIn the late nineteenth-century, Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg made significant academic contributions (including re-discovery of the Popol Vuh), but towards the end of his career became convinced that the ancient Maya culture could be traced to the lost continent of Atlantis. For example, in 1857 Brasseur identified Votan as a Phoenician ruler who founded Palenque and in an article published in 1872 attributed mythological Mesoamerican cataclysms to an early version of pole shift theory. Brasseur's work, some of which was illustrated by the talented but very inaccurate Jean-Frédéric Waldeck, influenced other works of pseudoscience and pseudohistory, such as the research of Désiré Charnay, Augustus Le Plongeon, Ignatius L. Donnelly, and James Churchward. Le Plongeon and Donnelly in turn influenced the work of writers such as Madame Blavatsky who brought misconceptions about the ancient Maya into early New Age circles. These ideas became part of a belief system fostered by psychic Edgar Cayce in the early twentieth century and later popularized in the 1960s by author Jess Stearn. One example of early Mayanism is the creation of a group called the Mayan Temple by Harold D. Emerson of Brooklyn, a self-proclaimed Maya \"priest\" who edited a serial publication titled \"The Mayan, Devoted to Spiritual Enlightenment and Scientific Religion\" between 1933 and 1941. Attempts at a synthesis of religion and science, a common theme in Mayanism, are one of the contributions from Theosophy while Emerson would be an early example of a plastic shaman in Mayanism.\n\nSince Mayanism is used to refer to a diverse collection of beliefs, it has no central doctrine. However, a basic premise is that the ancient Maya understood aspects of the human experience and human consciousness that remain poorly understood in modern Western culture. This includes insights into cosmology and eschatology as well as lost knowledge of advanced technology and ecology that, when known, can be used to improve the human condition and create a future Utopia. However, as a New Age belief system, Mayanism scorns academic scholarship, giving preference to knowledge gained through revelation and prophecy and to traditional knowledge (or what is imagined to be traditional knowledge). Mayanism literature frequently features beliefs and theories that ignore and reject physical evidence, facts, or knowledge, particularly when that evidence supports the academic \"Mayanist\" theories that contradict \"Mayanism's\" beliefs. As a result, the beliefs of Mayanism tend to be characterized by a combination of esotericism and syncretism, rather than being the result of either formal controlled field research or detailed scholarly research that has been based on a broad range of primary sources.\n\nThe significance of this date in Mayanism stems from the ending of the current \"baktun\" cycle of the Maya calendar in 2012, which many believed would create a global \"consciousness shift\" and the beginning of a new age. This has come to be known as the 2012 phenomenon. Speculation about this date can be traced to the first edition of \"The Maya\" (1966) by Michael D. Coe, in which he suggested the date of December 24, 2011 as one on which the Maya believed \"Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation.\". This date became the subject of speculation by Frank Waters, who devotes two chapters to its interpretation, including discussion of an astrological chart for this date and its association with Hopi prophecies in \"Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness\" (1975). The significance of the year 2012 (but not a specific day) was mentioned briefly by José Argüelles in \"The Transformative Vision: Reflections on the Nature and History of Human Expression\" (1975) and (without reference to the ancient Maya) by Terence McKenna and Dennis McKenna in \"The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching\" (1975).\n\nWaters' book inspired further speculation in the mid-1980s, including revision of the date by the McKennas, Argüelles, and John Major Jenkins to one corresponding with the winter solstice in 2012. Interpretations of the date became the subject of further speculation by José Argüelles in \"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology\" (1987), promoted for the 1987 Harmonic Convergence. It received further elaboration in the Novelty theory of Terence McKenna. The supposed prediction of an astronomical conjunction of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy with the winter solstice Sun on December 21, 2012, referred to by Jenkins in \"Maya Cosmogenesis 2012: The True Meaning of the Maya Calendar End-Date\" (1998) and \"Galactic Alignment:The Transformation of Consciousness According to Mayan, Egyptian, and Vedic Traditions\" (2002) as having been predicted by the ancient Maya and others, is a much-anticipated event in Mayanism. Although Jenkins suggests that ancient Maya knowledge of this event was based on observations of the \"dark rift\" in the Milky Way as seen from Earth (this \"dark rift\", it is said by some Mayan scholars, was believed by some Mayans to be one of the entrances to Xibalba), others see it as evidence of knowledge imparted via ancient contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. The relevance of modern \"dark rift\" observations to Pre-Columbian and traditional Maya beliefs is strongly debated, and academic archaeologists reject all theories regarding extraterrestrial contact, but it is clear that the promotion of Mayanism through interest in 2012 is contributing to the evolution of religious syncretism in contemporary Maya communities. Psychonaut author Daniel Pinchbeck popularized New Age concepts about this date, linking it to beliefs about crop circles, alien abduction, and personal revelations based on the use of entheogens and mediumship in his 2006 book \"2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl\".\n\nCarl Johan Calleman differs in that he sees 28 October 2011 and not 21 December 2012 as the pivotal end date. Calleman does not see the date as an apocalypse but a slow transformation of consciousness with people beginning to experience a higher 'unity consciousness'.\n\nShamanism has become a significant component of Mayanism, in part due to the scholarly interpretation of ancient Maya rulers as shamans and the popularity of Carlos Castaneda, whose books described his apprenticeship to a Yaqui sorcerer. However, Castaneda's work is seen as being fictional, inaccurate, misleading, and plagiaristic, and there is no proof that don Juan (the sorcerer) is not a fictional character. Although the Yaqui are indigenous to the Sonoran Desert region of northern Mexico and southern Arizona, far from the Maya region, Mayanism often conflates the concept of Toltec (Castaneda) with the Toltec who interacted with the ancient Maya. This stems from 19th century speculations by Brasseur and Charnay about the Toltecs as a white, Aryan race that brought advanced civilization to the Americas either through a migration from Asia across the Bering Strait (according to Charnay) or emigration from the lost continent of Atlantis (according to Brasseur).\n\n\n"}

After his parents were divorced, his mother remarried and moved the family to the Pacific Northwest in 1991, where he attended Inglemoor High School in Kenmore, Washington. Alienated by his southern roots, the isolation led him to focus all of his attention on learning to play guitar and writing songs. Inspired by seeing many punk shows including bands like Jawbreaker and Fugazi, he started several different musical projects while in high school.\n\nWhen his former band Lying on Loot disbanded in 1996, Votolato, along with friends Rudy Gajadhar (drums) and Andrew Hartley (bass), started playing under the name Waxwing. His younger brother Cody (The Blood Brothers) soon joined the band on second guitar, and the band recorded their debut 7\" for Henry's Finest Recordings. In 1999, Second Nature Recordings released their first full-length, entitled \"For Madmen Only\". Blending straight-up rock with elements of post-hardcore, and Cody's metal reminiscent guitaring, Waxwing soon established a strong local following. The band then signed with Second Nature Recordings out of Kansas City, MO. The band then released three full-length albums: \"For Madmen Only\" in 1999, \"One for the Ride\" in 2000, and \"Nobody Can Take What Everybody Owns\" in 2002. By this time, the band's profile in the Seattle music scene had grown substantially, causing them to consistently sell out at local clubs like the Crocodile Cafe and The Paradox Theater.\n\nIn 1999, Votolato branched out from his work with Waxwing, having written a handful of songs which did not really fit in with their more aggressive, fast-tempo style. Along the way he has toured with the likes of Damien Jurado, Small Brown Bike, The Get Up Kids, The New Amsterdams, Owen and The Casket Lottery, members of the latter having provided assistance as backing musicians on occasion. His studio albums have also been littered with appearances from some of Seattle's finest musicians (including players in the bands Red Stars Theory, Sharks Keep Moving, The Blood Brothers, Death Cab for Cutie, and Pedro the Lion, and Sub Pop solo artist Rosie Thomas).\n\nOn the production side, Votolato has worked with Matt Bayles (Pearl Jam, Botch, Murder City Devils, Hayden) and Chris Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie). It is a creative input which has helped see Votolato progress stylistically with every release, from his low-key self-titled album released in 1999 - all pretty much recorded live - right through to his recent, alt-country, folk-esque offering, \"Makers\". A video was shot for the first track of \"Makers\", \"White Daisy Passing\" - a song which also appeared on an episode of the popular TV show \"The OC\".\n\nVotolato also starred in the film \"The Edge of Quarrel\", which he worked on with Dave Larson from Excursion Records. It also includes members of the Murder City Devils and Botch, and is about a gang war between straightedgers and punk rockers and his attempts to achieve peace between the two opposing groups.\n\nHe has been married to his wife, April Votolato, for over 10 years, and they live in Seattle with their two children.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Based in London, Ontario, the company produced its first trading card sets in the 1930s, releasing several collections of baseball, gridiron football and ice hockey cards until the company was sold to Nestlé in 1996.\n\nThe O-Pee-Chee name was revived by trading card company Topps in 1997 to release hockey cards, being licensor until 2004. Three years after, Upper Deck became licensor for the O-Pee-Chee brand, having released sets up to present.\n\nThe O-Pee-Chee Gum Company got its start in 1911 when brothers John McKinnon (J.K.) McDermid and Duncan Hugh (D.H.) McDermid started to manufacture chewing gum. According to O-Pee-Chee literature, both brothers had been in the gum business and knew the business very well. The brothers had worked for C.R. Somerville, a gum manufacturing plant in London, Ontario. After the Somerville firm was sold to American Chicle Company in 1908 and the plant moved to Toronto, the McDermid brothers took over the box division and eventually purchased it in 1910 (Somerville Paper Box Limited). Shortly thereafter, they started O-Pee-Chee and produced their first box of Gipsy gum.\n\nThe name O-Pee-Chee is an Ojibwe word meaning \"the Robin\" as is found in \"The Song of Hiawatha\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. It also happened to be the name of McDermid's summer cottage in Grand Bend Ontario.\nIn terms of company genealogy, the McDermids owned the O-Pee-Chee Company Limited (as renamed in 1921) and Somerville Paper Box Limited until 1944. They sold Somerville Paper Box Limited to Garfield Weston in 1945 and changed their own O-Pee-Chee Co. Ltd. from a public company (since 1921) to a private company. The company was now run by John Gordon McDermid, the son and nephew of the McDermid brothers. The younger McDermid ran the company until his death in 1953 after which Frank Leahy took over the company. Leahy was the President of the O-Pee-Chee Co. Ltd. before he purchased the company from the McDermid estate in 1961. Leahy ran the business until his death in 1980, after which Gary Koreen stepped in and purchased the company from his wife, Mary-Margaret (the daughter of Frank Leahy).\n\nThe sales for the first year of operation of O-Pee-Chee Company Limited were $177,389.84 with a profit of $4,766.92. The products manufactured were chewing gum, mints and various types of popcorn - especially Krackley Nut. In that year, there were 30 employees in the plant and the annual payroll was $31,614.38, including management salaries and bonuses.\n\nIn 1921, O-Pee-Chee Gum Company was sold to a trust with the intent of incorporating the Company and changing its name to O-Pee-Chee Company Limited. Initially, it was incorporated as a public Company with five shareholders and four directors - all members of the McDermid family.\n\nIn 1928, a manufacturing facility was built at 430 Adelaide Street in London. Initially, this plant was erected primarily to supply a substantial export gum business to the United Kingdom. From 1928 until 1989, this plant housed some of the most modern gum and candy making equipment available in the world.\n\nDuring the depression years, the Company operated mainly at a loss. In 1933, a licensing agreement was signed with a Buffalo firm, W & F Manufacturing, Co. who made paraffin chewing gum and novelties. This allowed O-Pee-Chee to sell these products in Canada as well as in Great Britain, Scotland, and Ireland. In the mid-1950s, Gurley Novelties, a candle company in Buffalo, New York, also signed with O-Pee-Chee, so candles could be sold In Great Britain, Scotland, Ireland, and eventually Canada. O Pee Chee sold Gurley Novelty candles under the name Gaybrite and TinselTown in Ireland and Scotland. About this time, Frank P. Leahy joined the firm as Sales Manager and John Gordon McDermid, the son of J.K. McDermid, also became active in the business.\n\nTrading cards were a big part of the O-Pee-Chee business. Their first card sets were produced in the mid 1930s: a baseball \"diamond\" set (much larger than traditional cards) in 1934, five hockey sets between 1934 and 1938, a new baseball set in 1937, a Mickey Mouse set in 1935, and a Fighting Forces set in 1939. They made a few more sets in the 1940s, but it was not until the late 1950s that the company started to distribute cards on a regular basis. \n\nThe McDermids owned and operated both O-Pee-Chee Company Limited and Somerville Paper Box Limited until 1944 when they sold the Somerville business to Garfield Weston. In 1945, O-Pee-Chee Company Limited was changed from a public company to a private company. For many years, National Novelty Company was a subsidiary of O-Pee-Chee Company acting as a retail outlet, selling candy goods over the counter, and also servicing gum vending machines in the area.\n\nWith the arrival of World War II, accompanied by sugar and other commodity rationing, O-Pee-Chee Company existed mainly because of war contracts to supply dried egg powder to Europe and the United Kingdom. Employees, who worked at O-Pee-Chee during the war, recall the incident when a boat carrying a load of egg powder was sunk in the St. Lawrence River by a German submarine and the shipment had to be returned to London for repacking. During this time, the only gum product manufactured was Thrills - a product which is still being sold today.\n\nD.H. McDermid died in December 1942 and J.K. McDermid died of a heart attack in 1945 at age 79. J.K. was a charter member of the London Rotary Club and was an active executive of the Red Cross and YMCA He was a prominent member of the Talbot Street Baptist Church and deeded his property to the congregation where the First Baptist Church now stands in London. John Gordon McDermid became President in 1946 and ran the Company until his death in 1953.\n\nUnder the able leadership of the new President, Frank P. Leahy, the Company flourished in the late 1950s. In 1958, a licensing agreement was arranged with a manufacturer in Brooklyn, New York, which dramatically increased the future potential of O-Pee-Chee Company. Subsequent to this, in 1961, Frank Leahy purchased the Company from the McDermid estate.\n\nAbout this time, another licensing agreement was signed with a large candy company located in St. Louis, Missouri. These two licensing arrangements, which still exist today, allowed O-Pee-Chee Company to manufacture and market the products of these two firms in Canada. Immediately, new products became available to the Canadian market which substantially increased the Company's sales volume, allowing for more efficient manufacturing and marketing techniques.\n\nIn 1958, after the O-Pee-Chee Company entered into a marketing agreement with the Topps Company of the United States, O-Pee-Chee promoted annual trading card sets in Canada. Popular with kids, the standard packs included a stick of bubble gum with a stack of picture cards. In that first year, O-Pee-Chee helped produce hockey (1957-58 NHL) and football (1958 CFL) cards.\n\nIn the 1960s, O-Pee-Chee and Topps worked closely together to produce sports and entertainment sets. The three sports promoted by O-Pee-Chee were baseball, gridiron football and ice hockey. Starting in 1961, the printing and production for these cards was moved to the O-Pee-Chee headquarters in London, Ontario, Canada. Those first Canadian sets were the 1961 CFL and 1961-62 NHL sets. While those two sets were unique to the Canadian marketplace, the hockey series did compete against a Parkies hockey series up until 1963-64. Starting in 1965, parts (or sometimes all) of the Topps baseball (Major League Baseball) series was produced as an O-Pee-Chee series in Canada.\nIn the early 1960s, Beatlemania overtook North America with O-Pee-Chee Company having the rights to manufacture and market the Beatle Bubble Gum Cards for the Canadian market. In 1964, O-Pee-Chee produced four very popular entertainment card series featuring The Beatles. Up until 1967, the annual O-Pee-Chee (also known as Topps) hockey series was produced in Canada. After an American Topps \"test\" series was produced in the summer of 1967 (it looked just like the regular Canadian 1966-67 hockey series), O-Pee-Chee and Topps produced two annual hockey sets from 1968-69 onwards. The hockey double (an O-Pee-Chee set in Canada and a Topps set in the United States) coincided with the NHL's 1967 expansion from six to 12 teams. So while the 1967-68 series highlighted a six-team NHL, the two 1968-69 series highlighted a 12-team NHL. Of note, the Topps set would often be released first, but would include fewer cards than the O-Pee-Chee series. Also of interest, the card backs were primarily written by Topps, but the O-Pee-Chee card backs added a French translation.\n\nIn 1970, due to Canadian federal legislation, O-Pee-Chee was compelled to add French-language text to the backs of its baseball cards. It also happened to be the year after the Montreal Expos began to play in the majority Francophone province of Quebec. The practise of making bilingual cards had already been established for hockey. While O-Pee-Chee baseball sets were typically smaller than their Topps counterparts, its hockey sets for the Canadian market were larger. O-Pee-Chee also occasionally produced independent card sets of particular interest to Canadian collectors, such as one for the 1973 centennial of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nIn the 1970s, O-Pee-Chee's last CFL set was produced in 1972. After World Hockey Association cards were first featured in the 1972-73 hockey series, an annual WHA series was produced from 1974-75 to 1977-78. Apart from sports card, the company also produced movie and T.V. \"spin off\" cards such as \"Happy Days\" (1976), \"Charlie's Angels\" (1977) and \"Superman\" (1978). From 1977 to 1989, O-Pee-Chee produced cards based on popular motion pictures including \"Star Wars\" (1977), \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), \"E.T.\" (1982) and \"Batman Returns (1992)\"\n\nIn the 1980s, O-Pee-Chee (and Topps) produced annual album and sticker series for hockey and baseball (with the stickers produced by Panini). The stickers were so popular that Topps neglected to produce a hockey card series in either 1982-83 or 1983-84. (In fact, the stickers were so popular that by 1987-88 Panini had obtained its own license to produce NHL stickers in Canada).\n\nAfter working at O-Pee-Chee Company for nearly fifty years, Frank Leahy died suddenly in 1980. Gary E. Koreen, his son-in-law, who had been active in the business since 1968, became President and is now the owner of the business.\n\nIn 1989, O-Pee-Chee Company moved into a new plant in London East which accommodates all Manufacturing, Raw Material and Finished Goods Storage plus Offices and Employee Facilities. This investment improves present manufacturing capabilities and provides for future growth and expansion.\n\nIn 1990-91, O-Pee-Chee and Topps were joined in the NHL card market by Pro Set, Score and Upper Deck. That year, O-Pee-Chee produced a unique O-Pee-Chee Premier hockey series that was wildly popular with card collectors. Both an O-Pee-Chee and O-Pee-Chee Premier hockey series was produced in each of three successive seasons, but then in 1993-94 and 1994-95 only a Premier series was produced. As for baseball, the O-Pee-Chee Premier MLB series was produced from 1991 to 1993 while the last O-Pee-Chee MLB series was produced in 1994.\n\nThe 1994 Major League Baseball strike and 1994–95 NHL lockout and the accompanying damage to the baseball card industry hit O-Pee-Chee particularly hard. The company announced that it would leave the card business and refocus its efforts on candy. However, a number of changing circumstances kept them in the card business as well as candy.\n\nThe 1994-95 hockey season was the last for O-Pee-Chee as a full company, though the Topps marketing arrangement kept the name alive. In 1996, O-Pee-Chee was bought by Nestlé Corporation. In 1995-96, Topps included O-Pee-Chee cards in its signature product as a parallel set. It did the same in 1998-99 when it returned to the NHL market after a two-year hiatus. Later that year, O-Pee-Chee was re-introduced fully, as Topps used the company name for its Chrome set. One year later, O-Pee-Chee once again had a base-brand set.\n\nAfter Mr. Koreen sold his company, he kept the O-Pee-Chee brand name alive in the card collecting market through licences with the Topps and Upper Deck companies. From 1996 to 2004, the O-Pee-Chee name was used under license by Topps; since 2007, the O-Pee-Chee name has been owned by the Upper Deck Company.\n\nO-Pee-Chee cards continued to be produced through the 2003-04 hockey season. Prior to the start of the 2004-05 season, the NHL and NHLPA did not renew hockey-card licenses with the Topps Company (as well as In The Game or Pacific Trading Cards). Instead, the hockey market entered an exclusive five-year agreement with the Upper Deck Company to produce licensed NHL cards.\n\nIn 2006, Upper Deck entered into an agreement with O-Pee-Chee to revive the O-Pee-Chee brand. Upper Deck's initial O-Pee-Chee Hockey product was released during the 2006-07 season. Upper Deck lost its Major League Baseball license in 2010. They continued to use the O-Pee-Chee brand for ice hockey.\n\nVintage O-Pee-Chee cards are much sought-after today for their market value, and cards for popular players command high prices.\n\n\n"}

Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.\n\nUnited States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, 529 U.S. 803 (2000), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court struck down Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which required that cable television operators completely scramble or block channels that are \"primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming\" or limit their transmission to the hours of 10 pm to 6 am.\n\nIn order to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed, the U.S. Congress enacted Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 on the basis of a handful of complaints. No congressional hearing was held.\n\nSection 505 required cable television operators providing channels “primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programs” either to completely scramble or otherwise block those channels, or to limit their transmission hours to when children were unlikely to view. Administrative regulations defined children as unlikely to view programming between 10 pm to 6 am.\n\nPlayboy Entertainment Group, Inc. challenged Section 505's constitutionality, claiming that the provision violated the First Amendment.\n\nA three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware held that Section 505 was a content-based restriction on speech that was subject to strict scrutiny. In order to satisfy a strict scrutiny analysis, the Government was required to prove that it was “narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest.”\n\nThe Government offered three interests to justify Section 505: (1) protecting children from being exposed to sexually explicit material; (2) supporting parents' rights to raise their children as they see fit; and (3) ensuring an individual's right to privacy in the home.\n\nThe District Court agreed that the interests the statute advanced were compelling but concluded that it violated the First Amendment because the Government might further its interests through less restrictive alternatives. One less restrictive means is Section 504 of the Act, which requires a cable operator, upon request of a subscriber to fully scramble or otherwise block a channel that the subscriber does not wish to receive.\n\nThe United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court, seeking to have the judgment reversed.\n\nA group of sexologists filed an amicus brief on behalf of Playboy arguing that there was no state interest in shielding minors from sexually explicit signal bleed. The brief's authors included Elizabeth Rice Allgeier, Vern L. Bullough, Milton Diamond, Harold I. Lief, John Money, and Ira L. Reiss.\n\nAffirming the District Court, the Supreme Court held, in an opinion authored by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, that Section 505 was a content-based restriction because the provision singled out not only particular programming but also particular programmers.\n\nMoreover, although the Court accepted the Government's compelling interests, it nevertheless concluded that the provision violated the First Amendment's free speech clause because the Government failed to prove that Section 505 was the least restrictive means of preventing children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed. \nThe Court stated that Section 504 presented such an alternative means of regulation.\n\nThe Government argued that Section 504 was less effective than the blocking and time-channeling provision of Section 505. However, the Court held that Section 504, combined with “market-based solutions such as programmable televisions, VCR's, and mapping systems” can eliminate signal bleed without restricting a cable operator's ability to transmit its programming to those who want to receive it.\n\nThe Court concluded that because of the existence of such alternatives, which could be equally effective at furthering the Government's interest, the overly restrictive Section 505 violated the First Amendment.\n\nJustices Stevens, Souter, Thomas, and Ginsburg joined with Kennedy in the majority.\n\nStevens and Thomas filed concurring opinions. Stevens's concurrence specifically addressed Scalia's criticisms of the majority opinion. Stevens argued that Scalia defined obscenity too broadly and could include practices that were merely deceptive.\n\nThomas noted in his concurrence that he would have decided the case differently if the broadcasts were of obscene material. He posited that the government had merely argued that the broadcasts were indecent. First Amendment protections have more sway over merely indecent material than outright obscene material. Thus, the balancing of interests weighed in favor of upholding First Amendment protection.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer authored a dissent, arguing that the majority of the court had not made a \"realistic assessment of the alternatives.\" Breyer was joined in his dissent by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia.\n\nJustice Scalia also authored his own dissent arguing that Section 505 is constitutional because it regulates the business of obscenity.\n\n"}

The club was founded in 1973 with the purpose of building a successful football team that would be remembered for generations to come. They played their first season in 1974, winning the FAS Division Three League which earns a spot in National Football League Division One the following year. They enjoyed their greatest successes in 1980s and 90s, winning six consecutive FAS Premier League titles.\n\nGeylang International has won the league championship twice, since the inception of a professional league in 1996. They have won the 1997 Singapore FA Cup final and Singapore Cup once. Their greatest season was 1996, when they became the first team to win the league championship and FA Cup. They also reached the 1997 Singapore FA Cup final, 2001 and 2003 Singapore Cup final, and the 2012 Singapore League Cup final as runners-up.\n\nGeylang International has a tradition rivalry with closest neighbour Tampines Rovers. Matches between these two are referred to as the \"Eastern derby\".\n\nFormally founded by Colin Ng in 1973 during a dinner gathering with Arshad Khamis, Gulam Mohamed and Omar Ashiblie, Ng planned to build one of the successful club in Singapore. They were soon known as International Contract Specialists (ICS) FC and played its first friendly match against Rollel FC, a Singapore Business Houses Football League (SBHFL) Division One league club on 15 November 1973 with a 2–0 win.\nThey made their season debut in 1974, walking away with 2 titles – FAS Division Three League & President's Cup with no losses. This was not too difficult for them as they had several star players and well-known footballers among their ranks. With the likes of Arshad Khamis, Dollah Kassim, Gulam Mohamed, Samad Allapitchay, Kamal Mohd Nor and Robert Sim, they had a formidable side that receives the respect from oppositions. The team coached by The Yap Brothers, Sebastian and Andrew were no stranger to Football Association of Singapore. For the new season, in line with the Football Association of Singapore plans to streamline footballs and have teams on geographical consideration for the Division One League, ICS changed its name to Geylang International as their home ground was based at Geylang Field, Lorong 12. In 1975, they entered the National Football League Division One and won it before adding another title in 1976. Their back to back victory was made sweeter by winning the 1976 President's Cup. \n\nA relegation in 1981 prompted the arrival of a new management committee that guided the club back to the top division in 1983. In 1984, club president Kasim Chik financed the club and businessman Patrick Ang, who joined in 1986, managed to secure sponsors for them. Despite being relegated that year, they returned to Division 1 of the NFL the following season and the golden era began. In 1988, the FAS started a semi-professional league competition called the FAS Premier League as the top tier of the Singapore football league structure. they dominated all eight years of the league, winning six consecutive titles from 1988 to 1993 before finishing third in 1994 and second in 1995. Every game would see their home ground packed to the brim as fans clamoured to catch a game of the Eagles’ skilful players. Subsequently, due to the huge fan following which numbered in the thousands, all their games had to be played either in Jalan Besar Stadium or National Stadium. The success behind winning the FAS Premier League was also aided by the players they had. Notably players such as Malik Awab, Razali Saad, Dollah Kassim, Samad Allapitchay and Robert Sim all contributed to the success of the team. These were players who would also go on to represent the country. It might not be known widely by many but they even managed to attract one of the biggest European stars of that era to turn up in their club's colours. French forward and legend, Michel Platini visited Singapore to attend a football clinic conducted by them and played half a game for the Eagles to highlight the club's attraction.\n\nAs Geylang United Football Club, they were one of the eight teams in the inaugural season of the S.League in 1996. They won the first stage (the Tiger Beer Series) of the league season and finished fifth in the second stage (the Pioneer Series). They won the league after defeating SAFFC (the Pioneer Series champions) 2–1 in the Championship Play-off. They completed the season with another trophy, beating the same team on penalties in the Singapore FA Cup. As the team was full of international stars such as Fandi Ahmad, Kadir Yahaya, David Lee, Hamid Reza Estili, Mohammad Khakpour, and Chris Riley, Vincent Subramaniam (Head Coach for SAFFC) identified them as the Manchester United of Singapore. As league champions, they qualified for the 1997–98 Asian Club Championship but were eliminated after losing 8–2 on aggregate by Kashima Antlers in the first round.\n\nThe 1997 season was a disappointing season for them. They failed to defend the S.League title, finishing fifth. The Eagles also failed to defend the FA Cup, after losing to SAFFC in the finals. They did not win any silverware till 2001, when they won their second league title by a close margin. Both forwards, Aleksandar Đurić and Brian Bothwell scored 57 goals for the team. It was the best performing S.League season for the team; scoring 84 goals and conceding 28 goals. Just days after winning the league title, they suffered their worst defeat in history; losing 8–0 to Home United in the Singapore Cup finals. As league champions, they were guaranteed a slot in the qualifying round of the 2002–03 AFC Champions League but were eliminated after losing to Shanghai Shenhua 5–1 on aggregate in the second round.\n\nThe 2002 season saw Geylang United finish third in both the S.League and Singapore Cup. They came close to winning their third S.League title and first Singapore Cup in 2003, only to finish runners-up to Home United for both competitions. As runners-up, they qualified to play in the AFC Cup 2004 due to Home United's double. Their debut in the AFC Cup 2004 was an impressive one. Despite losing their opening match, they managed to stay unbeaten for their next five games in the group stage. They went on to qualify for the quarter-finals, beating Perak FA before losing to Al-Wahda in the semi-final.\n\nGeylang United won their first Singapore Cup in 2009, beating Bangkok Glass FC 1–0 at the Jalan Besar Stadium. The win ensured them a place in the 2010 AFC Cup. However, they failed to qualify for the knockout stages, finishing 3rd in the group stages with four draws and two losses.\n\nWeeks before the start of the 2012 season, Patrick Ang announced his retirement as club chairman. Ang, who had been with the club since 1986, moved up the ranks at the club as manager; vice-president; president and eventually chairman. He was given the nickname \"Geylang's Godfather\" after helping the club to gain main and co-sponsors. Former Singapore international, Leong Kok Fann took over the position. Mike Wong stepped down as coach after their 7–1 thrashing by Home United kept the club at the bottom of the league without a point. Under-21 coach, Vedhamuthu Kanan, swopped roles with Wong. Under the guidance of Kanan, the Eagles made it into the League Cup finals; only to lose in the final to Brunei DPMM. In the league itself, Kanan gave the U21 players the chance to be in the first team. It turned out to be a positive effort as some of these players who were given the chance to play in the S.League matches performed better than some of the first team players. They ended the season second from bottom in the nine-team table.\n\nIn 2013, the club announced in a pre-season press conference that it would change its club logo and name back to Geylang International FC. Their 2013 season saw the squad in a long-term injury crisis, forcing their then-assistant coach, former Singapore international Mohd Noor Ali to come out of retirement. They finished the season in ninth place.\n\nThe 2014 season was something to look out for as Kanan flew to Argentina during the pre-season to look for new foreign players. It was later announced that Leonel Felice, Franco Chivilo and Joaquin Lopez had signed a 1-year contract. In addition, Nazareno Velez joined in as assistant coach. However, the season did not start well. One of the Argentinian players failed to get their employment pass before the season kicked off. Kanan eventually got demoted back to coaching the U-21 team after 3 straight losses. Jorg Steinebrunner was appointed as the new coach 24 hours before their next match. Despite their poor league performance, Steinebrunner almost led the team to the finals of League Cup and Singapore Cup; only to lose both domestic competitions on penalty shoot-outs. The team ended the 2014 season in eighth place.\n\nIn 2015, Steinebrunner took this opportunity to get his own players ahead of the new season. The team was inconsistent throughout the season, failing to win most of their matches. After their defeat in the semi-finals of the League Cup, they failed to collect any points for six consecutive games, remaining rooted to the bottom of the table for months. An unbeaten run in their last five matches with 3 wins and 2 draws allowed them to finish one place off the bottom.\n\nWeeks after the 2015 S.League season ended, it was announced that Ben Teng would replace Leong Kok Fann as club chairman. Ben Teng and his new management committee (comprising mainly Singaporeans who have worked in Dubai/Abu Dhabi previously) set about to revamp the club by recruiting young players from the disbanded LionsXII and Courts Young Lions, anchored by seasoned players such as Daniel Bennett and Indra Sahdan. Four players, Hairul Syirhan; Yuki Ichikawa; Nor Azli Yusoff and Shawal Anuar) from the 2015 season were retained. In line with the club's philosophy of promoting young players from within, four Prime League players were promoted to the senior team (one was subsequently released to Young Lions at the request of FAS). The new 2016 squad also featured returning former Geylang Prime League players such as Stanely Ng, Amy Recha and Taufiq Ghani. Former Singapore international and championship winner with the 2001 Geylang team, Hasrin Jailani, was appointed as head coach. His team mate from the 2001 winning team, Mohd Noor Ali, was appointed as assistant head coach and Prime League coach. In its first S-League away match of the 2016 season against title favourites Tampines Rovers, the Eagles recovered from an early 2–0 lead by the hosts to lead 2–3 before an 86th-minute equaliser by the hosts. Geylang International finished 5th out of the 9 teams competing in the 2016 S league.\n\nIn June 2017, Mohd Noor Ali took over as head coach of Geylang International, managing the team he had won the 2001 S league with as a player. The Eagles improved on their previous position and attained 4th position in the 2017 S league. It was Geylang International’s first top four finish in 14 years \n\nIn 2018, Mohd Noor Ali went to abroad for a 1 year coaching stint with Japanese club Matsumoto Yamaga FC (as part of Geylang International’s collaboration with their sponsor Epson). Noor Ali’s venture abroad meant Hirotaka Usui took charge of The Eagles for the inaugural 2018 Singapore Premier League. Geylang International finished a disappointing 8th position that season.\n\nIn 2019, Mohd Noor Ali returned to Geylang International after guiding Yamaga’s “B” team to a league title . The Eagles welcomed new players like former Dutch U-20 Barry Maguire, and retained a strong youthful core in Darren Teh and Zikos Chua, and Azril Suhaili. Zikos Chua scored vital late goals during the season, as the resilient Eagles finished a commendable 5th place in the 2019 Singapore Premier League. The Eagles Ultras watched and cheered on the team to 10 wins out of 24 matches. That season, The Eagles also knocked out defending champions Albirex Nigata enroute to finishing 3rd in the 2019 Singapore Cup. The Eagles beat the 2019 Singapore Premier League champions, Brunei DPMM, in the 3rd/4th placing match 12-11 on penalties, after the match ended 2-2.\n\nMain Sponsor : EPSON\n\nOther Sponsors : Yongnam Holdings, Canaan Dental, Goodrich Global, Lesus\n\nGym Sponsor : Gymmboxx\n\nFootwear Sponsor : New Balance\n\nKit Supplier: FBT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2020, Thomas Gay, co-founder and deputy chairman of Goodrich Global Pte Ltd, and the club's vice-chairman for the last two years, took over from Ben Teng as the chairman of Geylang International. Ben Teng will remain as the Eagles' adviser and will oversee their strategic direction, specifically in the building of alliances with overseas clubs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague\n\nCup\n\nReserves\n\n\nThe Eagles’ home ground is the Bedok Stadium, located in the eastern part of Singapore. It is used both for football matches and community events. Besides that, the pitch is also used by the club for their training sessions. The stadium has a natural grass football pitch, an 8-lane running track and some athletic facilities. The stadium are closed to the public during official events and S.League matches. The stadium can hold up to 3,900 spectators. The stadium is currently managed by the Singapore Sports Council. \n\nThe Eagles’ home ground moved to Our Tampines Hub for the 2019 Singapore Premier League season, which they share with Tampines Rovers FC.\n\nWherever The Eagles play, they are well supported by a loyal and vocal set of supporters called The Ultras Eagles. Usually decked in black and green, they come with loud drums and a strong set of lungs, roaring on the team and setting a matchday scene unlike anything most of Singapore have ever seen. The passionate supporters have also formed a close bond with the team. This is especially evident when the Ultras and The Eagles players and coaching staff heartily participate in a post match song together, after every game, whether the team wins, loses, or draws. \n\nOn 7 November 2016, The Straits Times reported that Geylang International will not pay two of their players' December salaries. Former Singapore national captain Indra Sahdan and Carlos Delgado were affected. It is believed that the club docked Indra's salary as it is displeased that he missed many training sessions while Delgado had some disagreement with the management over money. Club chairman, Ben Teng revealed that as many as 12 players signed two-year full-time contracts at the beginning of this season. The management committee made most of the decisions regarding the handing out of contracts last season, before Teng came on board to replace Leong Kok Fann. Teng added that he has spoken to all the players and will intend to honour their contracts. In addition, some players, who supplemented their income by driving for Uber, have been ordered to stop such off-field activity. Teng revealed his concern and decided to impose a ban on such activities. The players have signed declarations that they do not have other employment outside of football. As professional, players should be focused on raising our playing standards and should not be distracted by off-field activities.\n\nOn 13 February 2018, Geylang International attempted to recruit foreign players online. The advertisement was swiftly removed once the public took notice of it. Despite this, Geylang International currently boasts a crop of talented foreign players. Japanese central defender and fan favourite Yuki Ichikawa would be playing in his 7th season with Geylang International come the 2020 Singapore Premier League season. Yuki will be remembered for scoring the dramatic last minute winner against his former club Albirex Nigata in the first game of the Eagles 2019 season. Barry Maguire, also starred for The Eagles in the 2019 season, scoring a tremendous long range goal against the Young Lions, winning the 2019 Singapore Premier League Goal of the Year award. \n\n"}

When opened by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield on 20 December 1920 the picture house was the largest and most luxurious cinema in Sheffield, often referred to as the \"Picture Palace\" because of the luxurious cream and gold colour scheme, and dark mahogany seats trimmed with green velvet. The picture house also boasted many intricate decorations and carvings, a mosaic floor in the foyer and a glass canopy with a marble pillar to the outside of the building. \n\nThe first film to be shown was \"The Call of the Road\" (IMDB entry). The cinema had seating for 1,560 people and also included a ballroom and a billiard hall (the latter is still in operation). Cine-variety played a major role at the Abbeydale until 1930 and the arrival of the \"talkies\" talking films; from this time the stage was used purely to house the sound equipment. In the mid-1950s the cinema was purchased by the Star Cinema Group which decorated the entire building and installed new projection and sound equipment, including a wide screen. \n\nThe cinema closed on 5 July 1975 and was subsequently used as an office furniture showroom until 1991. In 1989 the building was given a Grade II listing by English Heritage being a good example of an early 1920s mid-sized suburban cinema with both cinema and theatre facilities. In 1991 the sprung floor in the ballroom was removed, and local businesses \"Abbey Snooker\" and \"Bar Abbey\" occupied the site. \n\nIn 2003 the Friends of Abbeydale Picture House—boasting patrons including Michael Palin, Peter Stringfellow and the John Lewis Partnership—was formed to \"restore and manage the 'Picture Palace' as a community centre for the performing arts and visual media.\" The group took ownership of the building on 21 December 2005 and re-opened it in September 2008 following a restoration of the auditorium and installation of a new stage. \n\nThe Abbeydale Picture House hosted regular performances and fundraisers to raise money towards the ongoing restoration of the building. In June 2012 a stage adaptation of Hi-de-Hi! was produced by the picture house in conjunction with the family of the late David Croft. The building is open for guided tours as part of the Heritage Open Days program. The Friends of Abbeydale Picture House eventually went into administration and the building went into receivership \n\nOn 30 October 2012 the picture house was sold at auction to Phil Robins, for £150,000 with the intention to renovate the building and bring it back into public use as a climbing and sports centre. During this period further renovations were undertaken by Phil Robins, assisted during 2015-16 by Hand Of. \n\nIn January 2017 Abbeydale Picture House was leased to CADS Trust, a Sheffield-based arts charity, who are continuing the restoration project. The building is now regularly open to the public as a mixed use community arts venue as work progresses.\n\n"}

Native to densely vegetated habitats in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, its popularity as a cage-bird and songster has led to it being introduced elsewhere.\n\nIt was formerly classified as a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, causing it to be commonly known as the white-rumped shama thrush or simply shama thrush.\n\nThe nominate race is found in the Western Ghats and parts of southern India while \"leggei\" is found in Sri Lanka. Race \"indicus\" is found in the northern parts of India. Race \"albiventris\" is found in the Andaman Islands and now usually considered a distinct species, the Andaman shama. Race \"interpositus\" from southwestern Asia-China to Myanmar, Thailand and the Mergui Archipelago. Southern China has race \"minor\" while \"mallopercnus\" is found in the Malay peninsula. Race \"tricolor\" is found in the Sumatra, Java, Banka, Belitung and Karimata islands. Race \"mirabilis\" from the Sunda Strait, \"melanurus\" from northwestern Sumatra, \"opisthopelus\", \"javanus\", \"omissus\", \"ochroptilus\", \"abbotti\", \"eumesus\", \"suavis\" (Borneo), \"nigricauda\", \"stricklandii\" and \"barbouri\" are the other island forms. The last two are sometimes regarded as a separate species, the white-crowned shama (\"C. stricklandii\").\n\nThey typically weigh between and are around in length. Males are glossy black with a chestnut belly and white feathers on the rump and outer tail. Females are more greyish-brown, and are typically shorter than males. Both sexes have a black bill and pink feet. Juveniles have a greyish-brown colouration, similar to that of the females, with a blotchy or spotted chest.\n\nThe white-rumped shama is shy and somewhat crepuscular but very territorial. The territories include a male and female during the breeding season with the males defending the territory averaging 0.09 ha in size, but each sex may have different territories when they are not breeding.\n\nIn South Asia, they breed from January to September but mainly in April to June laying a clutch of four or five eggs in a nest placed in the hollow of a tree. During courtship, males pursue the female, alight above the female, give a shrill call, and then flick and fan out their tail feathers. This is followed by a rising and falling flight pattern by both sexes. If the male is unsuccessful, the female will threaten the male, gesturing with the mouth open.\n\nThe nest is built by the female alone while the male stands guard. The nests are mainly made of roots, leaves, ferns, and stems, and incubation lasts between 12 and 15 days and the nestling period averaged 12.4 days. Both adults feed the young although only the female incubates and broods. The eggs are white to light aqua, with variable shades of brown blotching, with dimensions of about .\n\nThey feed on insects in the wild but in captivity they may be fed on a diet of boiled, dried legumes with egg yolk and raw meat.\n\nThe voice of this species is rich and melodious which makes them popular as cage birds in South Asia with the tradition continuing in parts of Southeast Asia. It is loud and clear, with a variety of phrases, and often mimics other birds. They also make a 'Tck' call in alarm or when foraging. One of the first recordings of a bird song that was ever made was of this species. This recording was made in 1889 from a captive individual using an Edison wax cylinder by Ludwig Koch in Germany.\n\nThey are native across scrub and secondary forests in South and Southeast Asia, but have been introduced to Kauai, Hawaii, in early 1931 from Malaysia (by Alexander Isenberger), and to Oahu in 1940 (by the Hui Manu Society). Their popularity as a cage bird has led to many escaped birds establishing themselves. They have been introduced to Taiwan where they are considered an invasive species, eating native insect species and showing aggression towards native bird species.\n\nIn Asia, their habitat is dense undergrowth especially in bamboo forests. In Hawaii, they are common in valley forests or on the ridges of the southern Koolaus, and tend to nest in undergrowth or low trees of lowland broadleaf forests.\n\n"}

Their home ground is currently at Our Tampines Hub, where they had been since 2017, after six years playing away due to the construction of their new stadium. \n\nTampines Rovers has won major trophies in Singapore, including the Singapore Cup and the Singapore Premier League. They have won the national league championship eight times, the Singapore Cup thrice, the Singapore Premier League five times and the ASEAN Club Championship once. The Stags are known for boosting a considerably high attendance at home and away games.\n\nTampines Rovers is one of the wealthiest football clubs in Singapore. They were previously sponsored by Hyundai and Komoco Motors until 2016 season, ending a 15-year association. It is also one of the more widely supported football clubs in Singapore, attracting high attendances at both home and away games. Its main rival is Geylang International, with whom they contest the Eastern Derby.\n\nSeveral football enthusiasts from Tampines decided to form a football club in 1945. After many name changes, they finally decided on \"Tampines Rovers\" as the official club name. The Stags spent the 1950s and 1960s competing in the Singapore Amateur Football Association League, where they were among the top teams, until they were placed in Division II of the newly formed National Football League in 1974. 1975 was a watershed year for Tampines, as they were promoted to Division I after winning all their league matches and reached the President's Cup final, where they lost 0–1 to the Singapore Armed Forces Sports Association in front of a national record crowd of 30,000. They continued to challenge for honours for the next decade, reaching another President's Cup final in 1978, then emerging as national champions in 1979, 1980 and 1984. The Stags were relegated to the second tier in 1988, but under a new management team, won their league in 1994, and were one of eight clubs selected to compete in the newly formed S.League.\n\nHowever, Tampines did not finish higher than sixth place in the first six seasons of the S.League. In 2002, the Stags secured the services of Malaysian coach Chow Kwai Lam, who guided them to the Singapore Cup and two fourth-place finishes. Under the next coach, Vorawan Chitavanich, Tampines achieved the S.League and Singapore Cup double in 2004. The following season, they successfully defended their S.League title, were named the 'S.League Team of the Decade' and became the first Singapore team to win the ASEAN Club Championship. The Stags were Singapore Cup champions in 2006, but finished runners-up to SAFFC in the S.League. The Stags was also the champion of S-League in 2011 and 2012. They were also runner-up in the 2012 Singapore Cup after losing 1–2 to SAFFC.\n\nSigning 9 Lions XII players, Tampines Rovers FC began with 6 unbeaten matches in the S.League. In February Tampines Rovers FC started with the 2016 AFC Cup. Tampines Rovers FC finished second place in Group E with 10 points. Leaving the Red Giants behind with 2 points' difference. The round of 16 was won with 10 men by Tampines Rovers FC versus Mohun Bagan by a late goal in the after extra time 1–2. This was also V. Sundramoorthy's last match before taking on the Singapore national football team job as care taker. V. Sundramoorthy's successor was his Assistant coach Akbar Nawas. He was appointed to be the next head coach of Tampines Rovers FC followed with 8 straight wins and 28 goals. Tampines Rovers FC started the 2016 RHB Singapore Cup with a double win playing Global in the quarterfinals. Global had an unbeaten score in the whole of 2016 season. The Stags will face their AFC Cup rivals Ceres from their group stage were they draw and lost a match and let them finish 1st in the AFC Cup 2016 group E.\n\nIn view of the financial woes faced by the club during the 2016 season, drastic measures were taken before the start of 2017 season. These would include cut in players and technical staff's salaries, shutting down of fruit machines to name a few. Club chairman, Mr Krishna Ramachandra had decided to make sweeping changes within the club to avoid the same issues happening as last season. The 3 foreign imports from last season, Billy Mehmet, Jordan Webb and Jermaine Pennant had been released from the club with them joining Brunei DPMM, Warriors FC and Bury FC respectively. The club had also ended their 15-year association with their long term sponsor, Hyundai. A significant number of the playing staffs had also left the club as well, notably Hafiz Abu Sujad who left the club for Thai Division 2 side, BBCU F.C.\n\nThe club had signed a trio of foreign young players to replace the 3 that had departed the end of last season. They would include former Ceres FC utility player, Son Yong Chan, Japanese Teenage winger, Ryutaro Megumi and former Croatia U17 International, Ivan Jakov Džoni. They too did sign a couple of local free agents last season. Notable local signings would include Singapore National Team Defensive Pairing, Madhu Mohana and Daniel Bennett from Warriors FC and Geylang International FC. The most notable one would be the sudden resignation of coach Akbar Nawas who left the club just 1 month before the start of the season and was replaced by former Garena Young Lions Coach, Jürgen Raab.\n\nThey took on Global FC in the AFC Champions League Play-offs this season and lost to them 2–0, which meant that they would be playing in the AFC Cup this season where they finished as quarter finalists last season.\n\nMidway through the season, club chairman, Mr Krishna Ramachandra had announced that he would be stepping down as chairman of the club. Citing commitment issues as the reason. He stayed on as club chairman to assist in FAS in the auditing and settling the accounts of the club prior to the date of his official step down (22 August 2017).

The club started their 2018 season with an AFC Champions League Play-offs against Bali United. To ensure the job security of the players, Tampines Rovers started the initiative to offer longer term contracts to their players. They have 3 models of contracts for their players. The first kind of contract is that the players would be able to get a set increment at the end of every year. Second kind of contract (mainly for the U23 players) is that there would be a year-end review at the end of the season to decide on the amount of increment. The last kind of contract is that their salary would be the same for the duration of the contract. Most of their players are securing a 2-3-year deal with the club.\n\nDespite agreeing to a 3-year deal, the club has allowed midfielder, Shahdan Sulaiman, to go on a season-long loan to Melaka United, in view of long-term benefits for both clubs and the player. Some of the national players in the club had also moved on to play in overseas leagues as well.

The club kicks off its 2020 campaign against Bali United in an AFC Champions League play off on 14 January 2020.\n\nTechnical Sponsor:\n\n\nThe club selected the stag as its animal mascot as the animal is a symbol of wisdom, its antlers are associated with the tree of life and in Chinese culture, it is a symbol of virility. The club's colours are predominantly yellow for its Home kit, with a mixture of black, blue and white for its away colours.\n\nThe Yellow Brigade is the very first unofficial supporters group for Tampines Rovers FC formed in 2012. The group are mostly from LATW (Lions All The Way) They are a group of staunch supporters who had came out with a lot of initiatives to improve fans experience in the old Tampines Stadium during match days. They had also came out with their own version of fans' scarf and a lot of off the field initiatives to bring fans, the community and the team closer together.\n\nThe Yellow Knights is the second unofficial supporters group for the club, formed in 2019. The group are mostly fans who had been following the club for quite a while. They too, the same as The Yellow Brigade, do want to do their best to improve the fans experience in Our Tampines Hub. At the same time to serve as an informal feedback channel to the club management. They did too bring back some of the initiative in the past like Fans' Player of the Month. They are strong advocate of youth football supporting not just the first team but the youth teams whenever they can. At the same time they do as well recognize ex-stags in every way they possibly can in an attempt to bring the whole stag family together as 1 big family which includes the fans, stakeholders, club management, club technical staff, players and ex-players.\n\nThe Stags' home is currently at Our Tampines Hub, which has a seating capacity of 5,000. It is located on the same grounds as their previous home, Tampines Stadium.\n\nIn 2011, their previous home ground, Tampines Stadium, was demolished for the construction of Our Tampines Hub. They then relocated to play away at Clementi Stadium from 2012 to 2014 and at Jurong West Stadium from 2015 till the first half of 2017. \n\nOn 28 July 2017, Tampines Rovers had their first match at their newly-opened stadium against Brunei DPMM FC and won 2–0, signifying the return of The Stags to their spiritual home after six years. That match saw a crowd of 4,676 fans. Since then average attendance per match is approximately 2000 fans which is the highest in the league. In 2019, in view of the shared stadium initiative by Football Association Singapore, Geylang International will share Our Tampines Hub as their home ground. It caused a lot of unrest within the local football community, stating that without its spiritual home, the clubs are losing its identity.\n\n\nReference:\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\nLeague\n\nCups\n\n\n\n"}

However, he suspended this plan when offered the post of second-in-command on Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated \"Terra Nova\" expedition to the South Pole in 1910–1913, as captain of the expedition ship . He accompanied Scott to within 150 miles of the Pole, but was sent back in command of the last supporting party. On the return he became seriously ill with scurvy and only narrowly survived.\n\nAfter the expedition he toured the country giving lectures, and returned to his naval duties as a commander in the summer of 1914. He spent the First World War as a destroyer captain, becoming famous as \"Evans of the \"Broke\"\" after the battle of Dover Strait in 1917. He commanded a cruiser at Hong Kong in 1921–1922, where he was awarded a medal for his role in rescuing passengers from the wrecked-vessel , and then spent several years commanding the Home Fisheries Protection Squadron before being given command of the modern battlecruiser . He later commanded the Australian Squadron and the Africa Station before becoming Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, one of the Navy's senior Home Commands; during this time, unusually for a serving officer, he was also Rector of the University of Aberdeen.\n\nAfter four years at the Nore, he handed over command in early 1939, and was appointed Civil Defence Commissioner for London during the preparations for the Second World War; after the German invasion of Norway he travelled there to liaise with King Haakon VII, a personal acquaintance. He remained in a civil defence role throughout the War, though he had officially retired from the Navy in 1941, and was raised to the peerage in 1945, sitting in the House of Lords as a Labour member.\n\nEdward Ratcliffe Garth Evans, known to his family and friends as \"Teddy\", was born in London on 28 October 1880, at a mews near Berkeley Square. He was the second of three sons born to Frank Evans and his wife Eliza, \"née\" McNulty. Frank Evans, a young barrister at Lincoln's Inn, hailed from a large Lancashire family of Welsh descent; his father had been a provision merchant in Oldham. Eliza McNulty's family were of Irish origin and lived at Deptford.\n\nThe family were respectably middle-class, but the three Evans children did not behave as respectably as might be expected; when Edward was nine, he and his brothers frequently roamed far into the East End, on one occasion being detained by the police after a theft. Edward and his older brother Joe were admitted to the Merchant Taylors' School in 1890, when he was ten, and were expelled for fighting and truancy a year later. He was then sent to a relatively modern school in the countryside near Croydon, which aimed to educate \"troublesome boys\"; despite being the youngest boy and often victimised and homesick, he enjoyed the rural environment and responded well to the teaching. He later attended a school in Maida Vale where he obtained high marks but slipped back into his old misbehaviour; the headmaster responded by making him a prefect, which shocked Evans into self-discipline. He became one of the school's star performers, with a string of prizes, before leaving at 14.\n\nEvans sought a career at sea, and while at school had tried, but failed, to obtain a cadetship with the Royal Navy training ship . The alternatives open to him were to be \"crammed\" by an expensive tutor and resit the \"Britannia\" examination, or to attend the cheaper privately run training ship HMS \"Worcester\", which mainly trained officers for the Merchant Navy. His father chose the latter, and Evans joined the \"Worcester\" in January 1895. He was heavily bullied, but by the middle of his second year had found his place, and gained a reputation as an able and diligent – if still troublesome – cadet. He won several prizes, culminating in a coveted Navy cadetship in his final year.\n\nThe newly commissioned Midshipman Evans was posted to the cruiser in the Mediterranean in 1897, a ship noted for her immaculate presentation and strict conduct, which was not entirely to Evans' taste. In August he became seriously ill with brucellosis, after drinking contaminated milk, and was sent home to recover for three months. During this time, he gained a lasting fanaticism for physical fitness, walking forty or fifty miles in a day and swimming for hours in the sea; he would maintain this state of fitness for decades to come. After returning to duty, he was posted to the battleship and then the sloop , following which he was examined and passed as a sub-lieutenant. He then studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, interrupted with a posting to , where he first encountered then-Lieutenant Robert Falcon Scott.\n\nIn July 1901, the British National Antarctic Expedition – the \"\"Discovery\" Expedition\" – sailed from London aboard , with Scott in command. Part of the planning for the expedition had provided for a relief ship to follow a year later, in case \"Discovery\" was lost in the Antarctic; on reading a newspaper article about this some months later, Evans saw an opportunity for adventure and wrote to Sir Clements Markham, the organising force behind the expedition. He met Markham twice in the following weeks, and made a strong impression. In early 1902, Evans was seconded from the Navy to be second officer aboard the relief ship, the , an ageing ex-whaler.\n\nThe \"Morning\" sailed from London in July 1902, and after a severe storm and a refit in Christchurch, New Zealand, headed for the Antarctic on 6 December to search for the expedition in their winter quarters, somewhere in the Ross Sea. After working steadily south-east from Cape Adare and along the ice-front to Cape Crozier, the limit of their search range, they found a message from the expedition, directing them back towards McMurdo Sound. Here the two crews met – the two ships were separated by fifteen miles of ice, requiring long sledge journeys – with Evans among the first party to greet the \"Discovery\"s crew. A week later, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson returned from their journey inland, sick with scurvy and snow-blindness, but triumphant at having reached 82°17′S, a new \"Farthest South\". Evans privately recorded that having known the three was \"a great thing in my life\".\n\nAt the end of March 1903 the \"Morning\" was ordered to return, leaving supplies with the \"Discovery\", still sealed in the ice. Several crew were exchanged, including Shackleton, who was considered not healthy enough to remain for the winter, though personal conflicts with Scott may have played a part in the decision. Once back in New Zealand, Evans applied for a temporary posting to stationed in the country, while the \"Morning\" was refitted for another relief voyage, this time organised by the Admiralty rather than the Royal Geographical Society. She sailed south again in November, in company with a second relief ship, \"Terra Nova\", and met the \"Discovery\" in January 1904. Evans was given charge of a party of men laying explosives to blast a channel through eight miles of ice, which they achieved in eleven days, bringing the \"Discovery\" out just before a heavy gale struck. In recognition of his work with the expedition, Scott named a mountain overlooking the Sound as Mount Evans.\n\nShortly before sailing south for the second time, Evans' engagement to a New Zealand woman, Hilda Russell, had been announced. Hilda was the daughter of T.G. Russell, a prominent local solicitor, and the niece of G.W. Russell, one of the Members of Parliament for the Christchurch area. Evans arrived back in Christchurch on 1 April 1904, and the couple were married on 13 April. They arrived back in England in October, where Evans was awarded the Bronze Polar Medal and rejoined the navy, specialising as a navigation officer. In 1907 he briefly considered applying to join Shackleton's Antarctic expedition, but decided instead that it was important to spend more time in his naval career, to avoid limiting his future prospects.\n\nIn 1909, Evans finally succumbed to the lure of the Antarctic, and announced – with Markham's blessing – that he would organise an expedition to explore King Edward VII Land. He planned an expedition to the Pole, but as a secondary objective; \"the circum-navigation of the great Antarctic continent appealed to me far more\".. Evans initially sought support in Cardiff for a Welsh National Antarctic Expedition. Around the same time, Scott began planning a new expedition in response to Shackleton's recently completed Nimrod Expedition – the two were by this time rivals – and on hearing of this Evans abandoned his own project, transferring his funding and support to Scott. In return, Scott appointed him second-in-command. Evans brought so much Cardiff and Welsh sponsorship that Scott named Cardiff the home port of the expedition ship, \"Terra Nova\" and made Evans Captain. Despite this partnership, the two were never close, with the clash between Scott's reserve and Evans' openness accentuated by the difference in rank and age. Scott later described Evans in his diary as carried by \"boyish enthusiasms\" and \"well-meaning, but terribly slow to learn\", deeming that he was much more capable as a sailor than an explorer on land, and probably would never be suited to command his own expedition.\n\nThe expedition landed on the west side of Ross Island on 4 January 1911, at a site Scott named Cape Evans in Evans' honour. Evans joined the main shore party, leaving the \"Terra Nova\" in the hands of Lieutenant Harry Pennell, and worked to establish a series of depots along the Great Ice Barrier for the use of the Polar expedition later in the year. After wintering in the Cape Evans hut, the party began to prepare for the main journey in August and September. Evans was given command of the Motor Party, which was to leave first, taking four men and two tracked motor sledges south onto the Barrier with supplies for the main expedition, which would follow with dogs and ponies.\n\nIn the event, the motor sledges failed to work as planned; the engines proved unreliable, frequently refusing to start until heated, or stopping after a short distance. The first broke down permanently on 30 October, five days after starting, and the second followed a day later. The four men reorganised their loads and pushed south pulling a single sledge with of equipment and supplies. They managed about the same speed as before the breakdown, and made the rendezvous six days ahead of the main party, who caught up with them on 21 November. Two of Evans' party (the motor mechanic and an assistant) returned north, and the Motor Party was reorganised as the \"Man-hauling Party\". with Evans leading Chief Stoker Lashly, Surgeon-Lieutenant Atkinson and C. S. Wright, a Canadian physicist. The group pushed onwards until 5 December, when they were halted by a blizzard for four days, working through their supplies but unable to press south. The remaining ponies from the main expedition had to be shot before moving on. On arriving at the Beardmore Glacier on 10 December, their route off the Barrier, the dog parties were also sent back, leaving the entire expedition to be man-hauled.\n\nAt this point, the expedition was made up of three groups of four men, all man-hauling their sledges. However, two of the groups were relatively rested, whilst Evans and Lashly had been pulling a sledge since 1 November. This began to tell, with the group dropping behind and causing tensions with Scott, who grew frustrated and impatient with Evans' perceived carelessness and disorganisation. On 20 December, the first supporting party turned back, leaving eight men to press onwards; Evans' team was reorganised comprising himself, Lieutenant Bowers, Lashly, and Petty Officer Crean. On 3 January, Scott announced that Evans would not continue to the Pole, but would take his team, the Last Supporting Party, back north. Evans privately attributed this to his physical exhaustion – he and Lashly had pulled a loaded sledge for six hundred miles by this stage – and recorded his reactions stoically, though Bowers described him as \"frightfully cut up\". The groups parted emotionally on 4 January, and Evans, Lashly and Crean turned to head back, only from the Pole – Bowers had remained with the main party.\n\nThe journey back was difficult, as until this point the sledges had been handled by four-man teams, and the reduction to three slowed them considerably. In an attempt to save several days, the party descended from the plateau by sledging several hundred feet down the deeply crevassed Shackleton Icefalls onto the Beardmore Glacier, rather than take the slower and safer climb down the mountainside. The three emerged battered but without major injury, despite having reached speeds that Evans estimated at close to sixty miles per hour. Once on the glacier, however, Evans began to suffer severe physical problems. He was initially afflicted with snow-blindness, making him unable to see clearly, and later began to develop the early signs of scurvy. These signs rapidly multiplied, leaving him weakened and constantly in severe pain, and within a couple of weeks he had deteriorated to the point that he was being pulled on the sledge by Lashly and Crean. Evans was the only one to develop scurvy to this degree, and a number of arguments have been put forward as to the reason. However, it seems likely that the root cause was that unlike the other explorers, Evans had apparently tried to avoid eating seal meat (in particular seal liver) during the winter, which he disliked but which was a rich source of Vitamin C. As his companion Frank Debenham put it many years later, \"Teddy really was a very naughty boy and wouldn't eat his seal meat\".\n\nOn 13 February, Evans attempted to order them to abandon him, but they refused, in what Evans later called \"the first and last time my orders as a naval officer were disobeyed\". They were finally forced to halt by a blizzard on 17 February, thirty-five miles from the base camp at Hut Point, when it became clear that the two men would no longer be able to pull the sledge. Lashly remained to look after Evans while Crean headed north; after walking for eighteen hours, he arrived at the hut where he met Atkinson with an assistant and a dog team. They headed south as soon as the weather cleared, finding Evans near to death, and carefully brought him back to the camp. He arrived there a few days before the \"Terra Nova\" returned, and he was returned to the ship to be nursed back to health. He remained bedridden until April, when he arrived in New Zealand.\n\nAfter meeting Amundsen, recently returned from the Pole, and being reunited with his wife, Evans headed back to England, where he spent the northern summer of 1912 recuperating and raising funds for the Expedition. There, he met King George V, who promoted him to the rank of commander. Returning south later in the year, Evans commanded the \"Terra Nova\" on its relief journey; it arrived at McMurdo Sound on 18 January, the anniversary of Scott's arrival at the Pole, to be greeted by the news of the polar party's death. Recording his \"overwhelming sorrow\" at the news, Evans assumed formal command of the expedition in lieu of Scott, and organised the final departure of the expedition from the continent.\n\nEvans' wife, Hilda, became ill with peritonitis on board the \"Oranto\" on 14 April 1913 whilst on her way to England with her husband after his return from Scott's second and fateful expedition. She was operated on by the ship's doctor on 15 April. Conscious when the ship reached Naples on the 17th she stayed on board but after setting back to sea, she died at midnight of 18 April. Hilda was buried in Toulon, France. A memorial to Hilda Evans is to be found in Linwood Cemetery, Bromley, Christchurch, New Zealand at Block 46 Plot 205 – the Russell family grave.\n\nIn 1921 Evans published through Collins, a first hand account of the Discovery Expedition entitled \"South With Scott\". Out of print for many years, the book attracted interest as the centenary of the Expedition approached and it was re-examined from a counter revisionist perspective, most notably by Karen May of the Scott Polar Institute.\n\nFollowing his Antarctic service, Evans had a successful naval career, serving at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 in the rank of commander.\n\nOn 20 April 1917, while on night patrol of the Dover Barrage near Goodwin Sands, he commanded the destroyer in an action against six German destroyers of the Kaiserliche Marine that had started to bombard Dover. Along with , Evans engaged the German destroyers in what became known as the Battle of Dover Strait. A torpedo from HMS \"Swift\" sank one of the enemy destroyers, . Then the \"Broke\" deliberately rammed another, , almost breaking it in two. The two ships became locked together and for a while there was close-quarters fighting on \"Broke's\" deck until the \"Broke\" managed to break free. The German destroyer sank while the remaining German warships escaped. The badly damaged \"Broke\" was towed home, while the equally damaged \"Swift\" made her own way back. The action gained him immediate promotion to the rank of captain, award of the DSO, and made Evans a popular hero, feted in the British press as \"Evans of the \"Broke\"\". Evans wrote an account of his activities on the Dover Patrol in his book \"Keeping the Seas\" (1920).\n\nEvans married Norwegian Elsa Andvord in 1916, by whom he had two children: Richard Evans, 2nd Baron Mountevans (born 1918), and Cdr the Hon Edward Evans (born 1924), both of whom left issue.\n\nWhile in command of on the China Station, Evans rescued 200 survivors from the SS \"Hong Moh\". His actions, including swimming to give direction on the sinking ship, earned him several awards for life-saving.\n\nIn February 1928 he was promoted to rear-admiral commanding the Royal Australian Navy Fleet (formally titled \"Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron\"). In November 1932 he was made vice-admiral. He was commander-in-chief of the Africa Station and Deputy High Commissioner of the British Protectorates of Bechuanaland, Swaziland and Basutoland from 1933 to 1935. He served as Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, an operational command position of the Royal Navy based at Chatham in Kent, from 1935 to 1939 and was promoted to admiral in July 1936.\n\nEvans was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1935, and appointed a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (KGStJ) in 1937.\n\nRecalled in 1939, the following year Evans participated in the Norwegian Campaign, after which he retired from the Royal Navy on 9 January 1941. During the remainder of the Second World War he served as London Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence. On 12 November 1945, he was created a Peer as Baron Mountevans, \"of Chelsea in the County of London\". He was Rector of the University of Aberdeen from 1936 to 1942.\n\nOn 4 March 1947 Mountevans was on board a Norwegian vessel, MV \"Bolivar\", when it broke in two and was wrecked on the Kish Bank 13 kilometers from Dalkey Island. He and 44 others on board were rescued by the Dún Laoghaire and Howth RNLI lifeboats.\n\nIn 1947 Evans chaired a committee to formalise the rules of professional wrestling in the UK. These rules became known as the Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules.\n\nEvans died in Norway on 20 August 1957. He is buried in the family plot at the Vår Frelsers gravlund cemetery in Oslo.\n\nEdward Evans received numerous honours and decorations for his Antarctic efforts, military service and for life-saving (given with London Gazette entries, where available):\n\nCompanion of the Order of the Bath (LG 16 May 1913, p. 3507), (Knight Commander (1935))\nCompanion of the Distinguished Service Order (LG 10 May 1917, p. 4481)\nKnight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (20 Dec 1937)\nGrande-Oficial of the Order of the Tower and Sword – Portugal (LG 17 Jan 1919, p. 887)\nCommandeur of the Order of the Crown – Belgium (LG 8 Apr 1921, p. 2797)<br> \nKommandør of the Royal Norwegian Order of St Olaf (1939)<br>\nOfficier of the Legion of Honour – France (LG 20 Jul 1917, p. 7427)\nOfficier of the Order of Leopold – Belgium (LG 1 Jan 1917, p. 11)\nCavaliere of the Military Order of Savoy – Italy (1905)\nCroix de Guerre – France (LG 22 Jun 1917, p. 6257)\nNavy Cross – United States (LG 16 Sep 1919, p. 11583)\nMédaille Civique – Belgium (LG 12 Dec 1919, p. 15432)\nAntarctic Polar Medal (Silver) (LG 25 Jul 1913, p. 5322)\nSea Gallantry Medal (1921).\n\nHe was made a Freeman of several municipalities: Calgary, Alberta, Canada (1914); Dover (1938); Chatham (1939); Kingston upon Thames (1945); the City of London (1945); and Chelsea (1945).\n\nEvans also received various awards: recognising the part he played at the \"Hong Moh\" disaster in the South China Sea: Médaille Civique of Belgium, 1st Class for saving life at sea (1919); Board of Trade Silver Medal for Saving Life at Sea (1921); Special Gold Medal from Lloyd's for saving life (1921); <br>\nfor his part in expeditions: King Edward VII and King George V Medal<br> for Antarctic Exploration: Silver Polar Medal (24 Jul 1913); Gold Medallist of Royal Hungarian and Royal Belgian Geographical Societies; RGS Livingstone Gold Medallist; Gold Medals from the Cities of Paris and Rouen, and from the Geographical Societies of Marseilles, Rouen, and Newcastle; honorary member of many Geographical Societies; and, in academia: LLD, Aberdeen Univ, (1936).\n\nIn the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, Evans was played by Kenneth More.

The live ensemble achieved local renown for combining break-dancing, and Tucker's mobile DJing while manually playing repetitive, high-speed synthesizer basslines. They later became known as Regime, then RX-7, and finally, in 1994 they became Aux 88. They were joined by BJ Smith (Posatronix) and Lamont Norwood (DJ Dijital).\n\nTucker's first 12\" EP was a collaboration with Juan Atkins and Jesse Anderson, under the name \"Frequency\" in 1990. Aux 88 released the album \"Bass Magnetic\" and were the first group to revive Electro in the mid-to-late 1990s. As such they have been credited with eventually inspiring the genre known as electroclash. In the mid-nineteen ninteties they described their own sound as Techno-Bass, a fusion of influences from Detroit techno, electro, Miami bass and EDM.\n\nAs co-founder of Puzzlebox recordings in 1996 with Anthony \"Shake\" Shakir, Tucker also joined the tradition of independent dance music publishing and vinyl record pressing in Detroit. He utilized, along with other artists, the National Sound Company vinyl lathe which was used to produce the records of legendary Detroit Soul labels such as Motown.\n\nIn 2006, Tucker's song \"Plastic People\" was featured on the DJ mix album \"A Bugged Out Mix\" by Miss Kittin, which charted at number one-hundred seventy on the French Albums Chart.\n\nAmong his influences, he cites 1970s Funk such as Parliament, Kraftwerk and classical music, particularly Johann Sebastian Bach. The distinction of his solo work and production credits, is in their blending and refinement of syncopated, minimalist Electro and Techno rhythms influenced by the tonal undulations of Miami Bass and the Roland TR-808 drum machine.\n\nTrue to the Detroit techno tradition, Tucker's music is often emotive of a machine-like consciousness and a mental imagery of solipsism, urban alienation and decay. This is often expressed, masked or sublimated through metaphors of high technology, science fiction and space travel and conveyed through affected analogue synthesizer timbres. This harks back to Kraftwerk's description of their music – \"Electronic blues made with a jazz improvisation technique.”\n\n"}

The Eighteenth Century exports included heron feathers (for pens) and animal hides.\n\nIn 1831 a private school for young men was opened by Master Juan Castellano; in 1844 classes for younger children were added; in 1875 the Federal High School (el Colegio Federal de Segunda Categoría) was opened; and at the end of the 19th century the Federal School Leon XIII was opened.\n\nThe bridge across the Rio Apure at San Fernando commenced construction in 1959 under the direction of President Rómulo Betancourt, and was opened February 1, 1961. It cost 8.5 million bolivars.\n\nSan Fernando de Apure is recognized in Venezuela, to be a very warm locality by its location in the center of the Venezuelan plains. The daily annual average is 27.8 °C. Nevertheless, it is easily bearable. The humidity can reach more than 79%, or due to its location next to the Apure River that in its closer point of the city covers up to 300 meters wide in its channel. The relief of San Fernando is totally a plain. Natural land elevations do not exist, and the visibility of the horizon can reach up to 10 km. Some high barriers can be artificially by engineer installations for the prevention of floods. The city is established on humid grounds, reason why civil constructions superior to 5 levels are not admitted. In this sense, San Fernando projects a flat skyline.\n\nThis town also has an interesting phenomenon and fact regarding antipodes; San Fernando de Apure is a near-exact antipode (or polar opposites) to the city of Batu, Indonesia.\n\n\nThe city is conformed by three urban nucleus: San Fernando de Apure, who covers all the metropolitan area in both shores of the Apure River, the satellite town of Biruaca to the west, which conforms another political jurisdiction, and to the east \"El Recreo\" parish. In agreement with the 2001 Venezuelan census, the urban area of San Fernando was conformed by 175.056 inhabitants, having Biruaca an intercensal rate of the 69,4% relative growth, and San Fernando the 36,1%. San Fernando lifestyle varies according to zone, wealth and age. Many young people of the metropolitan area characterize themselves to assume an urban style with fort influence of nonown cultures of the locality, reflecting in first term North America lifestyle, and soon expressions of the north region of Venezuela (mainly, Caracas lifestyle). The adult population of the city is charged of a mixed style, that goes from traditional llanero customs, to the nonown. In certain groups of the greater adult population a traditional lifestyle is present, with typical characteristics of the region. Towards in the peripheral zones of the city, can be appreciated very rustic customs and traditions, with little impact of nonown cultures.\n\nUniversities in San Fernando include Simón Rodríguez University and Ezequiel Zamora Experimental National University of the Western Plains.\n\nOther universities:\n\n\n\n"}

The Uesugi are perhaps best known for Uesugi Kenshin (1530–1578), originally from the Nagao clan, one of Sengoku's more prominent warlords. The family name is sometimes rendered as Uyesugi, but this is representative of historical kana usage; the \"ye\" spelling is no longer used in Japanese.\n\nIn the Edo period, the Uesugi were identified as one of the \"tozama\" or outsider clans, in contrast with the \"fudai\" or insider \"daimyō\" clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan.\n\nTanba Province (Echigo during the Azuchi–Momoyama period)\n\nToyotomi, Tokugawa\n\nUesugi clan's crest: Two flying sparrows in bamboo. \n\nNagao clan's crest: nine suns with three tomoe.\n\nKenshin's standard: the first character in Bishamonten (毘, bi).\n\nKenshin's standard: the flag of divine appointment.\n\nKenshin's standard: open fan horse insignia.\n\nKenshin's standard: the suspended and chaotically written dragon character (龍).\n\nWarrior clan (prized swords and cavalry during Kenshin and Kagekatsu's time)\n\nNorizane, Kenshin, Kagekatsu, Kagetora, Harunori, Kuninori.\nThe clan claims descent from Fujiwara no Yoshikado, who was one of the \"Daijō-daijin\" during the 9th century.\n\nKanjūji Shigefusa was a 13th generation descendant of the clan's great progenitor. Near the end of the 13th century, he received Uesugi domain in Tango Province, and he adopted the name of \"Uesugi\" after arriving and establishing himself. The three main branches of the Uesugi are the Inukake, the Yamanouchi and the Ōgigayatsu.\n\nThe mother of the Shōgun Ashikaga Takauji (1305–1358) was a daughter of Uesugi Yorishige and a granddaughter of Shigefusa. \nThe three Uesugi branch families are descendants of Uesugi Yorishige.\n\nThroughout the Muromachi period, members of the clan were appointed \"shugo\" (provincial governors), and would also dominate the post of Kantō Kanrei (shogun's deputy in Kantō).\n\nThey gained such power in the Kantō region that, when in 1449 Kanrei killed his deputy Uesugi Noritada to significantly diminish if not eliminate the family's power, the Uesugi rose up and drove Shigeuji out of the area, asking the shogunate in Kyoto for another Kanrei. This development left the Uesugi extremely powerful within the Kantō region, more so than ever before, and the clan quickly expanded and grew, splitting into three branches, named after their home localities. The Ōgigayatsu became based at Kawagoe Castle, in Musashi Province, while the Yamanouchi were in Hirai, in Kōzuke Province. The third branch, the Inukake, held a castle in the region as well.\n\nThe three would begin fighting for domination of the clan and the region almost as soon as the split occurred, and intense fighting continued for roughly twenty-five years, until the end of the Ōnin War came about in 1477, bringing with it the end of the shogunate. Though the Ōgigayatsu and Yamanouchi branches both survived this conflict, the Inukake did not.\n\nTraditionally the Ōgigayatsu relied on the Ōta clan, while the Yamanouchi relied on the Nagao of Echigo Province as the pillars of their strength. Ōta Dōkan, a vassal of the Ōgigayatsu Uesugi, who were less numerous than their Yamanouchi cousins, lent them a great boost of power by building Edo Castle for them in the 1450s. On the other hand, Nagao Tamekage, Deputy Constable of Kamakura in the first decades of the 16th century, allied himself with Hōjō Sōun, who would later become one of the Uesugi's strongest rivals.\n\nThe expansion of the Hōjō into the lower Kantō forced the two branches of the Uesugi to become allies. In 1537, Kawagoe fell to Hōjō Ujitsuna. Then in 1545, both of the branches of the Uesugi shared defeat, and attempted to regain their power. However, the Ōgigayatsu branch family came to an end with the death of Uesugi Tomosada, during a failed attempt to retake Kawagoe castle that year. Uesugi Norimasa, the holder of Hirai castle, which had fallen in 1551 to the Hōjō, took up arms with his retainer, Nagao Kagetora in Echigo. Kagetora then adopted the surname of \"Uesugi\" after campaigning against the Hōjō in Sagami Province; he would later take the name Uesugi Kenshin, and become one of Sengoku's most famous generals, battling the Hōjō and Takeda Shingen for control of the Kantō.\n\nAt the end of the Sengoku period, Kenshin's adopted son Uesugi Kagekatsu, then head of the clan, was a supporter of Ishida Mitsunari during the battle of Sekigahara. As a result of being on the losing side of the conflict, the Uesugi were afterwards much reduced in power.\n\nUesugi Kagekatsu was given the \"tozama\" domain of Yonezawa (300,000 \"koku\") in Dewa Province, in Honshū's Tōhoku (Northeast) Region.\n\nMuch research has been done on the economics of Yonezawa in the Edo period, particularly by Mark Ravina among others, and it is taken as fairly representative of a \"tozama\" (outsider) domain. Yonezawa was far from the capital, with far less direct political control from the shogunate, and also less trade and urbanization. Yonezawa was largely an agricultural domain, making it again a good representation of agricultural and social developments among the peasantry in this period.\n\nDespite agricultural advances and generally high growth in the 17th century, Yonezawa, like most parts of the country, experienced a considerable drop in growth after 1700; it may in fact have entered stagnation or decline. The official \"koku\" revenue of the Uesugi \"daimyō\" was cut in half in 1664, but the clan continued to expend as before, maintaining the same lordly standard of living. Yonezawa, again representative of many other domains, entered debt, and was especially hard-struck by famines in the 1750s. The situation became so bad that in 1767, \"daimyō\" Uesugi Shigesada considered giving the territory back to the shogunate. Instead, he allowed his adopted son Uesugi Harunori to take over as \"daimyō\"; through agricultural and moral reforms, and series of other strict policies, Harunori turned the domain around. In 1830, less than ten years after Harunori's death, the shogunate officially praised Yonezawa as an exemplar of good governance.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration in 1868 brought the abolition of the \"han\" system, that is, the end of the domains, the feudal lords, and the samurai class.\n\nThe head of this clan line was ennobled as a count in the Meiji period. The present head of the clan, Uesugi Kuninori (born 1942) is a professor at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Ministry of Education.\n\n\nUesugi is a playable faction in the video games \"\", \"Europa Universalis IV\", \"Sengoku\" and \"Sengoku Basara\".\n\n"}

The story follows superhuman Meriem Cooper, a 19-year-old jungle woman who battles dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures in the Cretaceous period.\n\nRoot credits the artist William Stout, as well as the \"Playboy\" cartoon feature \"Little Annie Fanny\", as his inspirations for the character.\n\nThe artists Devon Massey and Robert Durham have done much of the cover art for the series and related one-shots and spin-offs.\n\nRegarding the character's creation, Root said, \nHe added that Meriem was \"patterned after pretty much all the women I really respect. She's got a body with kind of a \"Little Annie Fannie\" face with Danni Ashe's boobs and Nina Hartley's butt.\"\n\nMeriem Cooper first appeared in Basement Comics' \"Cavewoman\" #1 (Dec. 1993), the first issue of a black-and-white, miniseries that ran for six issues. She reappeared in the popular eight-issue miniseries \"Cavewoman: Rain\" (1996–1997) from Caliber Comics, and \"Cavewoman: Odyssey\" #1 (1999), the only issue of a planned five-issue miniseries from Caliber Comics. She also appeared in the four-issue series \"Cavewoman: Missing Link\" (1997–1998), and the three-part series \"Cavewoman: Jungle Tales\" (1998).\n\nDuring her early years Meriem also appeared in several one-shot comics, like \"Cavewoman Meets Explorers\" (1997), jointly from Basement Comics and Explorer Press; \"Jungle Tales of Cavewoman\" (1998), released in both a standard and a mature-audience edition; and \"Cavewoman: Color Special\" (1999), reprinting a story in the comic \"Threshold\" #7.\n\nAfter 2000, Meriem appeared in the ongoing series \"Cavewoman: Pangaean Sea\". After the events of \"Cavewoman: Rain\" the town of Marshville was destroyed, and Meriem and the inhabitants migrated to the shores of the Pangaean Sea.\n\nThis was the last lengthy Cavewoman series to date, and by far the longest. The first comic \"Cavewoman: Pangaean Sea Prologue\" was first published in 1999, and the series lasted eleven issues from 2000 to 2009.\n\nSince 2001 Meriem has starred in the semi-regular mature series \"Prehistoric Pin-ups\", which lasted for five-issues until 2010; and \"Cavewoman: Meriem's Gallery\", a four-part series until 2009. She has also been in the semi-annual series \"Cavewoman: Cover Gallery\" (2002–2013), and the successful five-part \"Cavewoman: Reloaded\" (2005–2009), which was a reprint of \"Cavewoman #1–6\" with new content. \"Cavewoman\" celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2003.\n\nMeriem has also appeared in eight two-shot comics spanning the years between 2000 and 2012, the best known are \"Cavewoman: Raptor\" (2002), and \"Cavewoman: Jungle Jam\" (2006). She was also in thirteen single-issue comics such as \"Klyde & Meriem\" (2001), \"Tanlines Pinup Book\" (2002), \"Cavewoman: The Movie\" (2003), \"Cavewoman: Beauties & Beasts\" (2005), \"Budd's Sketchbook of Sketchbook Sketches\" (2010), and \"Cavewoman: A Night Out\" (2010).\n\nIn 2013–2014 \"Cavewoman\" celebrated its 20th anniversary with the two-part issues \"Cavewoman: Oasis\" (2013), and \"Cavewoman: Journey\" (2014). Basement Comics also released nine single issues featuring Meriem, including \"Cavewoman: Uncovered\" (2013), \"Cavewoman: The Many Faces of Meriem\" (2013), \"Cavewoman: Labyrinth\" (2013), \"Cavewoman: Killing Dinos 101\" (2014), and the much awaited \"Cavewoman: 20th Anniversary Show Book\" (2014).\n\nIn the 20 years of \"Cavewoman\", Meriem has appeared in more than 300 separate issues of the comic, featured in 92 serial issues, and 34 one-shot issues. Meriem has also appeared in over 200 reprints and special edition issues, such as special mature content issues and new cover art issues.\n\nThe story of \"Cavewoman\" is rooted deeply in science fiction and fantasy.\n\nMeriem Cecilbie Cooper is born in July 1980 to parents Robert Addam Cooper and Gail Nicole Reicher, in the fictional town of Marshville, Oregon. After Robert dies of unknown causes, Gail turns to drugs, which leads her to fall in with an unsavory secret group of government agents. Eventually wanting to sever her ties with this group for Meriem's sake, Gail seeks the help of Meriem's scientist-inventor grandfather Francis Peacock Reicher affectionately called \"Gramp.\" After first being thwarted, Gramp makes a mysteriously superhuman return, defeating the agents easily and taking 8-year-old Meriem away on a hovercycle from the future.\n\nAt Gramp's laboratory, Meriem discovers a time machine and a body-enhancing device that allows a living being to pass through the time stream. It is here that she first meets Klyde, Gramp's 15 ft. gorilla who has been accidentally altered by the body enhancer. Gramp then enhances Meriem as well, but accidentally instead of going 70 years into the future Gramp, Klyde and Meriem are transported 70 million years into the past. Thus the trio begins an ongoing adventure through time while on the run from dinosaurs and a secret branch of the government.\n\nMeriem and Gramp settle in a large cave and begin a struggle for survival. As events transpire, Gramp is killed early on by a Tyrannosaurus and Meriem leaves the cave. After a fierce fight with local carnivores, Meriem ends up naked when her clothes were torn off during the fight.\n\nAfter more than ten years, and growing into a buxom 19-year-old, Meriem lived in the local jungles naked, savage, happy, and free. Dinosaurs were taught to fear her. Meriem becomes reunited with Klyde, who attacks her and almost kills her. She then returns to the cave. Not wanting to be naked and savage anymore, she eventually makes a jungle bikini (with dinosaur teeth hanging on the strings) out of a leopard-printed snakeskin blanket. She also avenges her grandfather by slaying the Tyrannosaurus responsible for killing him, but rescues two Tyrannosaurus hatchlings from Velociraptors. One named Harmony becomes Meriem's companion while the other named Peace became her enemy.\n\nLater, the whole town of Marshville is transported into a prehistoric past. When this takes place, Meriem becomes their guide and protector in the prehistoric world. The civilians had to protect themselves from the dangerous dinosaurs by building an electric fence around Marshville. She eventually leads most of the Marshville citizens safely to the Pangaean Sea.\n\nMeriem's various superhuman powers come from her enhanced molecular structure. It was altered and enhanced by Gramp, so that she could survive the rigors of time travel. Meriem stands at 5'8\", weighs 350 lbs, and possesses extraordinary strength and stamina. She is strong enough to rip a Velociraptor's arm out of its socket. She has also picked up a downed street lamp. Meriem's strength also allows her to leap lengthy distances, such as between buildings in New York City, or leaping onto the top of a truck's trailer from street level. She is strong enough to leap through the forest with a full-grown man on her back.\n\nMeriem is also highly resistant to injury. A high-caliber gunshot to the back and bites from Velociraptors have failed to penetrate her tough skin. She can survive falls from great heights, such as when she fell from a cliff to the beach. Things that have been proven able to penetrate her skin, or otherwise injure her, are attacks that are directed with great strength or force, such as a Tyrannosaurus bite, Klyde's blows, or armor-piercing ammunition.\n\nMeriem's enhanced molecular structure gives her an enhanced healing effect that reduces the healing time of wounds. The effect is hastened proportionally to her food intake: the more food consumed, the more quick the healing. Meriem always gets hungry after she gets injured. Meriem has healed dinosaur bites, armor-piercing bullet wounds, and even a Yeti yanking off all of her head hair: the next morning she had grown her hair back. The worst injury Meriem is shown taking is when she battled a berserk Klyde during \"Cavewoman: Rain\". Klyde beats her to the extent that she stops breathing and appears dead. She remains in this \"death state\" while her enhanced molecular structure slowly repairs itself, without Meriem being able to eat anything to hasten the healing process. The citizens of Marshville bury her, thinking she is truly dead, though the healing effect repairs the damage after two weeks.\n\nMeriem also has above average running speed, described as moving at \"30 miles per hour\". Once, when she ran, her boyfriend Bruce had to ride after her on his motorcycle in order to keep up with her.\n\nShe is an extremely powerful swimmer and can hold her breath for long periods when fighting underwater. She has also proven resistant to the effects of drowning, being capable of expelling water from her lungs even when unconscious.\n\nMeriem's senses of smell and hearing are also enhanced. In addition, she has psychic powers, the limits of which have not been revealed. She can see Gramp as a kind of spirit who appears to her from time to time, offering advice and insight. No one can see or hear Gramp but Meriem. She has psychic bonds with Klyde and Harmony. Meriem's sight is also extremely good: she can see an ant up to two miles away.\n\nShe is also an expert knife thrower, and can decapitate a pterodactyl with a thrown blade. She is also highly efficient with a knife in hand-to-hand combat, and is also an expert with a spear. Meriem is also accomplished in wrestling and boxing.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During his time in the service, the Marine Corps' graphic arts department utilized his art skills for drawing tanks and airplanes for internal presentations. \n\nIn 1993, after leaving the Marines, Root attempted to get into the comics industry. After repeatedly being rejected by Marvel Comics and the mainstream companies, Root happened to meet author James Robert Smith at Smith's comic book store. Smith gave Root his first paid work, illustrating \"James Gang\" and \"Johnny Thirteen\" stories in \"James Gang\" #1, published by London Night Studios. The one issue of \"James Gang\" sold poorly; so poorly, in fact, that Root was paid in King Kong collectible cards from Smith's comic book store. \n\nNonetheless, that first taste of getting published proved irresistible to Root and he was hooked on comics. Pooling money with his wife Leslie, he formed Basement Comics and self-published the first issue of \"Cavewoman\" in 1993. The book has proven to be extremely successful, spanning many issues, specials, and one-shots; and has since gone on to be published by Caliber Press and Avatar Press, in addition to Basement Comics.\n\nRoot's one-shot \"Cavewoman: Jungle Tales\", was nominated for a 1999 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Story.\n\n\n"}

It is in the district of West Lancashire, and with the parish of Newburgh forms part of Newburgh ward. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 914. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through Lathom.\n\nLathom was recorded as Latune in the Domesday Book in 1086, Lathum in 1200, and Lathom in 1223 after which it was the usual spelling.\n\nIn 1066 the manor of Lathom was the most important of 17 manors held by Uctred, an Anglo-Danish landowner. These manors were set up by Æthelstan in the 10th century. By 1189 Robert Fitzhenry de Lathom possessed lands throughout south Lancashire, extending to Flixton in the barony of Manchester. Siward son of Dunning held the township in thanage in the reign of Henry II. Robert de Lathom, in the reign of Edward I was granted the right to hold a market and an annual fair. Robert Lathom founded Burscough Priory in or before 1189.\n\nThe manor was conveyed by the marriage of Isabella de Lathom, Sir Thomas Lathom's daughter to Sir John Stanley in 1385, the reign of Henry IV. Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby entertained Henry VII in his castle at Lathom.\nThe present West Wing of Lathom House gives a hint of the importance of Lathom and the Stanley family who became the earls of Derby. The village grew around the castle at Lathom.\n\nLathom is the location of Lathom House built in the Middle Ages, seat of the de Lathom and Stanley families, twice besieged during the English Civil War and subsequently bought by Sir Thomas Bootle who restored the ancient mansion. It passed through his niece to Richard Wilbraham and their son, Lord Skelmersdale. The main block was demolished in 1925.\n\nLathom was a township in the parish of Ormskirk in the West Derby hundred in south Lancashire.\nIn 1837 Lathom became part of the Ormskirk Poor Law Union which took responsibility for administering the Poor Law in the area.\nThe Lathom Sanitary District was formed in 1875 and Lathom became part of the Lathom and Burscough Urban District in 1894.\nIn 1931 Lathom was incorporated into the Ormskirk Urban Uistrict which lasted until 1974.\n\nLathom, which measured about six miles from north to south, covered an area of 8,694½ acres in west Lancashire.

There are roads leading north from Bickerstaffe and Skelmersdale.\n\nTo the west of the township the land is flat but to the east it rises to 215 feet above sea-level. To the south the land is flat and in the mid 19th century there were collieries. The geology of the western part of the township consists of the bunter series of the new red sandstone, with overlying beds of lower keuper sandstone, the eastern part lies on the Middle and Lower Coal Measures of the Lancashire Coalfield.\n\nLathom Chapel is a plain rectangular building constructed in about 1500 and a chantry was founded there by the second earl. The chapel, dedicated to St John the Divine, was consecrated by the Bishop of Sodor and Man. The chapel was restored in 1810, at a cost of £1,200. A free school was built at the hamlet of Newburgh in 1714.\nThe chapel holds regular Anglican services.

He shares the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. He split with the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1991 to form Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP) and the multi-sectoral group Sanlakas.\n\nFrom the split, he led the formation of the \"Partido ng Manggagawang Pilipino\" (Filipino Workers' Party), an underground revolutionary socialist party, which, after his death, merged with the Sosyalistang Partido ng Paggawa (Socialist Party of Labor) and the \"Partido para sa Proletaryong Demokrasya\" (Party for Proletarian Democracy).\n\nDuring the First Quarter Storm, he was a member of \"Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan\" (Democratic Association of the Youth) in the 1970s. After only a year in college at the University of the Philippines, he decided to go underground and do full-time organizing work in the factories and urban poor communities in the northern sector of Metro Manila. Ka Popoy was elected Secretary of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee of the CPP in the mid-70's and spearheaded the broad formation which challenged the Marcos dictatorship in 1978 Batasan Pambansa elections. The Central Committee of the CPP admonished Ka Popoy and the whole regional committee for advocating participation in 1978 Batasan Pambansa elections because it ran counter to the CC call to head to the counryside to wage armed struggle against the dictatorship. Ka Popoy was only to return at the helm of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee after the EDSA uprising of 1986. In spite of the differences with the central leadership, Ka Popoy strived harder to strengthen revolutionary work in the capital city.\n\nKa Popoy is also known to be the only Party leader that during the struggles with the CPP that put forward the most comprehensive and in-depth critique against the basic Party documents of CPP-NPA which are now popularly known as Counter-Thesis 1 (PSR: A Semi-feudal Alibi for Protracted War, PPDR: Class Line vs. Mass Line and PPW: A New-Type Revolution of the Wrong Type) and Counter-Thesis 2 (On the Reorientation of the Party Work and the Reorganization of the Party Machinery).\n\nHe was the first prominent victim of a political assassination under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, carried out in \"Bahay ng Alumni\", University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City on February 8, 2001. His assassination is widely speculated to have been carried out by his former associates in the Communist Party. The assassins and the culprits have not yet been apprehended as of 2008. On July 2007, the Quezon City Prosecutor’s Office decided to drop the case on eight suspected communist assassins since the witnesses were unable to attend the preliminary investigations.\n\nFilemon grew up in Caloocan City. He was a track and field athlete of Caloocan High School. He was of short stature (perhaps about 5'6\" in height). His belligerence started to manifest during his early high school days whenever he voices out his communistic beliefs by being argumentative against a few teachers that contradicted his ideologies. Then Superintendent of City Schools, Mrs. Modesta G. Boquiren \"played politics\" and heeded his voice on occasions by not contradicting him. Lagman found friendship with Mrs. Boquiren's nephew Florante \"Randy\" Deguzman as his temporary running mate in high school. Filemon graduated in 1970 while Florante in 1971. They've lost contact in College days.\n\nFilemon's first wife was Dodi Garduce, while second wife was Bobbie Jopson (sister of another revolutionary martyr Edgar Jopson, owners of Jopson's Supermarket in Sampaloc, Manila). His brother is current Albay congressman Edcel Lagman.\n\nWhen Martial Law was declared on 21 September 1972, Lagman established the first network of the underground revolutionary movement in Navotas. He organized, along with his comrades, the labor unions in factories and other work sites, launched mass mobilizations, developed a political mass base among workers and recruited more party members for the CPP.\n\nAt the height of the CPP split, Lagman wrote the biggest critique on CPP founding chair Jose Maria Sison's book Philippine Society and Revolution--the Counter-thesis. Lagman argued in his critique that Philippine society was capitalist in a backward and underdeveloped way, rather than being semi-feudal and semi-colonial. Lagman thus posited that a workers-led revolution must be waged to dismantle capitalism, instead of a protracted people's war from the countryside.\n\nLagman was ambushed and shot to death by two unknown assassins on the afternoon of 6 February 2001, at the east-side steps of the University of the Philippines Bahay ng Alumni in Diliman, Quezon City. At the time of his death, Ka Popoy was working on the launch of the Partido ng Manggagawa, the workers' political party that would participate in the 2001 mid-term elections, among other revolutionary tasks for the Filipino working class.\n\n"}

They also finished runners-up in the Singapore FA Cup in 1997, and also in the Singapore Cup in 2005 and 2008 and won the President's Centennial Cup in 1998, a cup competition organized by the Philippine Football Federation to celebrate the centennial of Philippine Independence by defeating Hong Kong Rangers FC 2–1 in the final in Bacolod.\n\nTheir best finish in the S-League came in the 1996 Tiger Beer Series where they were runners-up.

Woodlands Wellington FC plays in Island Wide League and they plan to re-join S-League in the future.\n\nWoodlands Wellington was founded as Wellington Football Club in 1988 as a splinter group of Delhi Juniors (a team of Singaporean football enthusiasts, dating back to the 1940s, that were among the pioneers of football in Singapore). Despite their name, the team did not originate from New Zealand as many believe. Instead, the name stems from the Deptford Ground located on Wellington Road in Sembawang where the team started playing football in 1988.\n\nIn 1991, they participated in the Sembawang Group League and National Island-Wide League, winning as champions in both competitions and setting a national record by beating Seletar Football Club by a 27-goal margin. This was one of the biggest wins the club had ever achieved, as they beat their opponents 28 – 1 at the Woodlands Stadium on 17 November 1991. Amalar Louis scored a record 12 goals in that match.\n\nThe following year, Wellington FC joined the Singapore National Football League in Division 2, from which they were promoted as champions in 1994. The following season they finished first in Division 1 (going unbeaten for 24 matches) and were runners-up in the FA Cup.\n\nWellington Football Club were selected as one of eight clubs to compete in the newly formed S.League in its inaugural season in 1996, prompting the club to adopt Woodlands Stadium as their home ground and to change their name to Woodlands Wellington Football Club.\n\nFollowing their admission to the S.League, Wellington FC's founder, R. Vengadasalam, was appointed as the Team Manager of Woodlands Wellington and Bandai were announced as a sponsor in their maiden season in the S.League. Following this, they signed Jan Janostak, Joe Caleta and Ervin Boban, from the M-League, as well as Singapore national players Borhan Abu Samah, Tamil Marren, Zakaria Awang, from England Notts County legend Darren Davis (footballer) and Croatian goalkeeper Sandro Radun, who played for the Singapore FA in 1992.

Siva Kumar. The transfers of Goh and Siva Kumar were particularly controversial as Woodlands and Jurong were well-known rivals in the league.\n\nWoodlands Wellington made the headlines in the 2007 S.League season for a walkout by the entire Woodlands squad in a match against Tampines Rovers as a protest to the decisions made against them by referee P. Pandian. Woodlands were fined $30,000 for the incident and had six points docked. Tampines coach Vorawan Chitavanich was reported as saying \"I spoke to their coach just a little while ago and he said that they acted on the instructions of their club chairman.\"\n\nA report by The New Paper on 22 November 2012 suggested that Woodlands may be in financial trouble and could be the second club to sit out the 2013 S.League after Gombak United has announced earlier that it would not be taking part in the league in 2013. This sparked off a supporter-driven \"Save Woodlands\" awareness campaign on the same day. The club held an open meeting with the supporters and press at Woodlands Stadium later that evening and quashed the report. Team manager, Matthew Tay, also said that the club was already preparing a pre-season tour of Malaysia, and that the club would be signing players and would also be aiming for a minimum 8th spot in the table this season.\n\nIn November 2014, it was announced that Woodlands Wellington and Hougang United will merge for the 2015 season and a new club name will be used.\n\nHowever, the merge never occurred and the club now plays in 2016 Island Wide League.

Woodlands Stadium houses a natural grass football pitch, an eight-lane running track and partial athletic facilities.\n\nBesides the sporting facilities mentioned above, the stadium also has a Singapore Pools outlet located near to the entrance of the away fans' stand, as well as the clubhouse of Woodlands Wellington FC.\n\nWoodlands Stadium, Yishun Stadium and Bedok Stadium are the only stadia in Singapore which has a MRT track overlooking the pitch. \n\nWoodlands Stadium started off with a total seating capacity of 1,600 when it was first constructed. Following the inauguration of the S.League in 1996, where the stadium was assigned as the home ground of Woodlands Wellington FC, the stadium capacity was upgraded to 4,300. This includes a 2,000 seater grandstand, a 1,000 seater semi-permanent stand opposite the grandstand and a 1,300 seater portable stands at each end of the pitch.\n\nAs Wellington Football Club, the team played in a white kit with purple and green trimmings. As soon as they were rebranded into the Woodlands Wellington Football Club in 1996, the Rams changed their home kit to all white with a narrow stripe of yellow and green down the middle.\n\nIn the ensuing years, yellow was employed as the main colour of choice for the home kit and this has become the traditional colour for the club.\n\n\n\n\nWoodlands Wellington FC was sponsored by Bandai from 1996 to 1998, after which it was sponsored by Sembcorp from 2001 to 2010. The club went without a sponsor from 2011 to 2012 before Singaporean equity company, ESW, took up the sponsorship of the Rams from March 2013.\n\nThe team is presently outfitted by Singaporean kit makers, Waga, for the 2013 season. Their previous kit sponsors include Lotto, Kappa, Diadora, Umbro, Mitre and Thai apparel makers, Acono.\n\n\nThe supporters' club of Woodlands Wellington Football Club are known as The Black Sheep. They can be seen at both home and away games dressed in the club's official colours of yellow and blue and are usually seated behind the Rams' dugout. Since its inception, The Black Sheep have been using the warcry \"Never Surrender!\" to rally their players on.\n\n"}

He was the fourth son and sixth of eight children of Rev. Daniel Crosby Greene, a Congregational minister, and Mary Jane (Forbes) Greene. His parents, descendants of colonial Massachusetts families, had been among the earliest American missionaries in Japan, arriving in 1869 and serving until their deaths (the mother's in 1910, the father's in 1913); they were deeply involved in bringing modern Western education to the Japanese during the Meiji era. Two of their other children achieved prominence, Evarts Boutell as an American historian at Columbia and Jerome Davis Greene as a foundation administrator, banker, and secretary of the Corporation of Harvard University.\n\nRoger Greene was born in Westborough, Mass., while his parents were on furlough in the United States. After earlier schooling in Japan, he entered Harvard, from which he received a B.A. degree in 1901 and an M.A. the following year. He then obtained a position with the consular service and over the next twelve years held posts in Brazil, Japan, Siberia, and China; at Hankow (1911–1914) he performed with distinction as consul general during the Chinese revolution. Perhaps as a result of his missionary heritage, Greene became uncomfortable in his role as agent of the interests of the United States, feeling an obligation to mankind more broadly conceived. He therefore surrendered a highly promising diplomatic career to accept in 1914, an opportunity to join in the philanthropic activities of the Rockefeller Foundation, of which his brother Jerome was then secretary.\n\nGreene began as a member of the foundation's commission which surveyed the medical and public health needs of China. The commission's recommendations led to the establishment, later in 1914, of the China Medical Board, to foster medical education in China through the improvement of hospitals and medical schools and the granting of fellowships to missionary and Chinese physicians. Wallace Buttrick of the General Education Board accepted the directorship of the board, and Greene was made resident director in China. He remained in China until 1935, becoming director of the China Medical Board in 1921 and serving from 1927 to 1929 as vice-president of the Rockefeller Foundation in the Far East. He also took a particular interest in one of the board's projects, the Peking Union Medical College, and became acting director in 1927.\n\nDuring his years with the China Medical Board, Greene developed close ties with China's westernized intellectuals, most notably the philosopher-diplomat Hu Shih. He was deeply involved in projects directed toward the modernization of China, especially in the field of public health. He also kept up a steady correspondence with members of the Department of State responsible for American policy toward China. With China torn by civil strife in the 1920s, Greene urged a policy of noninterference, arguing that the Chinese were entitled to the freedom that Americans had enjoyed in the 1860s: the freedom to fight their civil war until one side won a decisive victory and could unify and determine the future of the country. In 1927-1928 he led a group of Americans in Peking, mostly missionaries, who successfully opposed a plan by the American minister for intervention in cooperation with the other great powers. Greene's opinion carried special weight at this time because Nelson T. Johnson, his former protégé in the consular service, had taken over responsibility for East Asian affairs within the State Department.\n\nTension developed, however, between Greene and the Rockefeller Foundation. This was partly the result of Greene's character and style. To many he seemed the archetypical New Englander, austere, righteous, and rigid; and he was, indeed, highly principled and uncompromising. He regarded with contempt the increasing involvement of John D. Rockefeller III in China Medical Board affairs and would do nothing to appease that young man's sensibilities. A host of financial issues, born of the board's depression-ridden desire to cut expenses, served as irritants, but the major issue became the future of the department of religion at Peking Union Medical College. In founding the college in 1916, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., had acquired the facilities of a British missionary medical school and had declared his intention to continue the school's religious atmosphere. Greene, however, had come to believe that the effort to instill Christianity in medical and nursing students was an anachronism in modern China. As Chinese nationalism grew more intense in the 1920s and 1930s, both students and faculty objected to the department of religion. Regarding the department as expendable during the budget crisis, Greene fought hard for his beliefs, but lost out in a confrontation with the Rockefellers. He resigned from the China Medical Board in 1934, and later the same year, by direction of the board, submitted his resignation from the Peking Union Medical College as of July 1935.\n\nGreene emerged from semi-retirement in the late 1930s as a leader in organizations formed to work for the support of China and Great Britain against Japan and Germany. From 1938 to 1941 he served as chairman of the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression and from 1940 to 1941 as associate director of William Allen White's Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. For both organizations he lobbied with federal officials for American assistance to China. More than any other private citizen, Greene had the attention of Stanley K. Hornbeck, the State Department's powerful senior advisor for Far Eastern Affairs. Almost alone, he kept the Committee to Defend America from focusing its entire campaign on the war in Europe.\n\nIll health curtailed Greene's activities shortly before Pearl Harbor, but he was able during the war to serve part-time as a consultant to the State Department's Division of Cultural Relations. He maintained a deep interest in Chinese affairs, and while he gradually, with misgivings, came to regard the Kuomintang as China's best hope, he was outraged by the attacks on John S. Service and other Americans who had reported favorably on Chinese Communist activities. He also lent active encouragement to the development of East Asian studies in the United States. Greene's home in his later years was Worcester, Massachusetts. He died in West Palm Beach, Florida, of cardiac failure and chronic nephritis and was buried in Westborough, Mass. He was survived by his wife, Kate Brown, whom he had married on May 8, 1920, and their two children, Edward Forbes and Katharine Curtis.\n\nHe was also the great-great grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman.\n\n[Greene's papers, at Harvard, are a basic source. There is MS material also in the files of the State Department (Nat. Arch.); of the China Medical Board and Rockefeller Foundation, N.Y. City; of the Am. Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression (Harvard); and of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies (Princeton).

Ferguson, China Medical Board and Peking Union Medical College (1970); Who Was Who in America, II (1950); obituary (with photograph) in N.Y. Times, Mar. 29, 1947.

{"id": "2296895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296895", "title": "Confederate Memorial Hall Museum", "text": "Confederate Memorial Hall Museum\n\nConfederate Memorial Hall Museum is a museum located in New Orleans which contains historical artifacts related to the Confederate States of America (C.S.A.) and the American Civil War. It is historically also known as \"Memorial Hall\". It houses the second-largest collection of Confederate Civil War items in the world, behind the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, Virginia. The museum has been advertised as \"Louisiana's Civil War Museum\" and as \"Louisiana's Oldest Museum\".\n\nThis \"Adjunct of the Howard Memorial Library Association\", according to Frank T. Howard's letter of 8 Jan. 1891, was placed in the \"possession\" the Board of Governors of the Louisiana Historical Association \"to be set apart forever for the use of\" that organization. Sully & Toledano designed the hall, which was completed in 1888, following the Richardsonian Romanesque style of the Howard Library designed by H.H. Richardson.\n\nThe Confederate Memorial Hall contains over 5,000 historical artifacts including several rare Civil War items. It holds the personal effects and uniforms of Confederate generals Braxton Bragg and P.G.T. Beauregard, as well as over 140 regimental and other C.S.A. flags. Jefferson Davis' wife Varina Davis donated several of her late husband's belongings to the museum including items of clothing, his Bible and saddle, plus a crown of thorns from Pope Pius IX.\n\nConfederate Memorial Hall was established in 1891 by New Orleans philanthropist Frank T. Howard, to house the historical collections of the Louisiana Historical Association. The museum quickly accumulated a vast collection of Civil War items, mostly in the form of personal donations by veterans.\n\nOn 29 May 1893, the exhumed body of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was mourned by over 60,000 people as it lay in state in the hall, before being moved to his final resting place in Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia).\n\nFor much of its existence the Confederate Memorial Hall's building has been the subject of an ownership dispute that has involved numerous court battles and the involvement of several Louisiana political figures including Governors Huey Long and Mike Foster. The dispute has revolved around Howard's original donation of the building to the Louisiana Historical Association, which read \"It is with deep satisfaction that I perform the act of formally putting into your possession the Building, which, while it is an Adjunct of the Howard Memorial Library Association, is to be set apart forever for the use of your organization.\" In 1930 the adjoining Howard Library sought the museum's building space to store portions of their collection. Governor Long negotiated a compromise in which the museum permitted the library to store some of its books in their basement.\n\nIn the 1940s the Howard Library outgrew its facilities and relocated to Tulane University. Its building was sold shortly afterwards and, after transferring to several owners, was donated to the University of New Orleans in the early 1990s. The old Howard Library building and a nearby property neighboring the Confederate Memorial Hall were then converted into the Ogden Museum of Southern Art by UNO. The location of Memorial Hall in between the two Ogden buildings gave rise to the latest dispute over the property, as visitors to the Ogden museums would have to exit each building and travel outdoors around the Memorial Hall to reach the remainder of the collection. A solution was proposed in which a tunnel between the two buildings through the Memorial Hall basement would be constructed and a proposal was drafted by Confederate Memorial Hall, but UNO withdrew from the negotiations in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Tulane University, having absorbed the Howard Library, sold its title to the Memorial Hall building to UNO, which it claimed to possess as the former owner of the Howard Library properties. In 2001 the UNO foundation announced its claims to the Confederate Memorial Hall building and initiated efforts to remove the museum from the premises. A series of court battles ensued in which title ownership to the property was granted to UNO, however efforts to evict the museum were stayed by the courts on bonds.\n\nAs the case proceeded through the appellate processes, Governor Mike Foster intervened in the dispute and assisted in the drafting of a compromise between UNO and the museum that would allow Confederate Memorial Hall to remain in its historic building. In August 2003, at Foster's direction, both parties agreed to drop pending lawsuits to the building in exchange for fulfillment of a compromise agreement. Per the agreement, UNO is required to cede its title claims to the Confederate Memorial Hall museum's land and building in exchange for the construction of a connecting tunnel through the basement as was proposed in the 1997 plan. The compromise is to be implemented in full within 10 years time, or upon the completion of the tunnel, depending upon which comes first.\n\nIn 2011, a Confederate Battle Flag from the 14th Louisiana Infantry Regiment, stolen from the museum in the 1980s by a volunteer, was recovered from a collector who reportedly purchased the flag in 2004 without knowing it had been stolen.\n\n"}
{"id": "2296898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296898", "title": "Flash fire", "text": "Flash fire\n\nA flash fire is a sudden, intense fire caused by ignition of a mixture of air and a dispersed flammable substance such as a solid (including dust), flammable or combustible liquid (such as an aerosol or fine mist), or a flammable gas. It is characterized by high temperature, short duration, and a rapidly moving flame front.\n\nA flash fire is defined by NFPA 2112 as:\n\nFlash fires may occur in environments where fuel, typically flammable gas or dust, is mixed with air in concentrations suitable for combustion.\n\nIn a flash fire, the flame spreads at subsonic velocity, so the overpressure damage is usually negligible and the bulk of the damage comes from the thermal radiation and secondary fires. When inhaled, the heated air resulting from a flash fire can cause serious damage to the tissue of the lungs, possibly leading to death by asphyxiation. Flash fires can lead to smoke burns.\n\nFlash fire is a particular danger in enclosed spaces, as even a relatively small fire can consume enough oxygen and produce enough smoke to cause death of the persons present, whether by asphyxiation or by smoke inhalation.\n\nProtective clothing made of fire-retardant materials (e.g. Nomex) reduces or prevents thermal injury in the body areas that are covered by the fire-retardant material. Even normal clothing can provide partial protection.\n\nSmall flash fires can occur in the operating room during surgery where the presence of ignition sources such as electrical instruments or lasers, an oxygen-rich environment, and flammable vapors (e.g. alcohol-based disinfectants) may set the stage for such an accident. While apparently smaller fires go unreported, surgical flash fires have led to burn injuries and fatalities.\n\nIncidents of surgical fires are \"significantly under-reported\", according to The Joint Commission. More than half of surgical fires happen inside a patient's airway or on the patient's upper body; around 10 percent of surgical fires actually happen within the body cavity, and a quarter of surgical fires happen on other parts of the body. About 70 per cent are ignited by electrosurgical tools commonly known as Bovies, devices that use a high-frequency electric current to cut tissue or stop bleeding. 20 percent of fires are sparked by hot wires, light sources, burrs or defibrillators. Another 10 percent are touched off by lasers.\n\nAs far as the patients are concerned, some recover with scars and emotional damage. Some die from burns and smoke inhalation. \n\n"}

{"id": "2296909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296909", "title": "Johnny Pearson", "text": "Johnny Pearson\n\nJohn Valmore Pearson (18 June 1925 – 20 March 2011) was a British composer, orchestra leader and pianist. He led the \"Top of the Pops\" orchestra for sixteen years, wrote a catalogue of library music, and had many of his pieces used as the theme music to television series.\n\nJohnny Pearson was born John Valmore Pearson in Plaistow in the London Borough of Bromley, the only child of a steel erector. At age seven, Pearson began studying piano. By nine, he had won a scholarship with the London Academy of Music, where he spent four years under English pianist Solomon.\n\nIn his teens, he would give classical recitals and start a jazz band, the Rhythm Makers. During World War II, Johnny Pearson served in the Royal Artillery Band. After the war, he became one of the founding members of the Malcolm Mitchell Trio in October 1948, before leaving in 1954 after Malcolm Mitchell broke up the group to start a solo career. During his time with the trio, Johnny Pearson toured England and Europe, playing the West End and theatres. The early Malcolm Mitchell Trio consisted of Malcolm Mitchell, Teddy Broughton and Johnny Pearson.\n\nAfter leaving the Malcolm Mitchell Trio, Pearson turned his talents to British radio, as well as performing in the Peter York Concert Orchestra. By 1960, he was conducting the Romance in Rhythm Orchestra. He recorded two singles for Parlophone, \"Waterfall\" in mid 1959, and \"Theme from The L Shaped Room\" in 1962. He was then offered a solo album deal with Oriole Records, which first teamed him up with John Schroeder. The Oriole album, \"Piano Sweet - Piano Wild\" was released in 1962 and was Johnny Pearson's first full vinyl album release. Also there was a 45 single released, \"Ooh La La\", in 1962 but this track and its b-side did not appear on the album. After the Oriole releases, Johnny Pearson continued to perform with various concert orchestras until 1964.\n\nIn early 1964, Johnny Pearson took part in helping launch the career of Cilla Black, a rising singer who had been spotted by The Beatles producer, George Martin. She had released her first 45 single, \"Love of the Loved\", in 1963, but it had charted only modestly despite having been written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. A scout for George Martin had spotted the track \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" after hearing the US singer Dionne Warwick's version. Originally the song was to have been recorded in the UK by Shirley Bassey, but George Martin saw the piece as being more suitable for Black's voice. Early in 1964, \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\" was recorded by Cilla Black at London's Abbey Road Studios, in an arrangement by Pearson which featured the use of bassoons. In February 1964, it entered the UK Singles Chart, eventually reaching number 1 in both the UK and Ireland and also charting in other parts of Europe. The Dionne Warwick version was also in the UK charts at the time (although it only managed to peak at Number 42), but Cilla Black's treatment used slightly different lyrics and a different arrangement.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\", Pearson was invited to work on the next Cilla Black single, \"You're My World\", which was released in May 1964. This was also recorded at Abbey Road Studios, and again went to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. Pearson also worked on other Cilla Black tracks, some of which featured on her album, \"Cilla Sings a Rainbow\".\n\nSounds Orchestral was an idea by John Schroeder, who had moved from Oriole Records to become the label manager at Pye Records and was interested in producing an instrumental version of the US hit song \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\". This had been suggested to him at the time by Pye staff member, Tony Reeves. As his project moved to fruition, Schroeder looked for a piano player. His efforts came about when he was reminded of Johnny Pearson from a few years earlier, after he heard him on Radio Luxembourg. Initially paid a session fee to record \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\", Pearson was subsequently made a full partner in the Sounds Orchestral project. \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\" was a number 5 hit in the UK Singles Chart in early 1965. Sounds Orchestral would end up recording some seventeen albums between 1965 and 1977. Some have subsequently been reissued on CD.\n\nPearson first appeared on the BBC music show \"Top of the Pops\" in January 1965 playing piano with Sounds Orchestral on \"Cast Your Fate To The Wind\", which charted at the time. The following year in 1966, Pearson took charge of the Top Of The Pops Orchestra, established after the Musicians' Union forbade miming on televised musical performances. By the summer of 1980, the Musicians' Union went on strike after budget cuts led to the BBC terminating several orchestras, including that of \"Top of the Pops\". During the strike, \"Top of the Pops\" was off the air from June to August 1980. Pearson continued contributing to the programme until the 900th episode in the summer of 1981. Pearson's arrangement for the Top of the Pops Orchestra of Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\" was the theme tune to \"Top of the Pops\" for most of the 1970s.\n\nDuring 1966, as well as Top Of The Pops, Johnny Pearson worked and directed the orchestra for the Dusty Springfield shows which were recorded by the BBC, for television. It featured Johnny Pearson directing a full 32 piece orchestra. There were a total of twelve episodes made, six in 1966 and six in 1967. In recent years, the surviving nine episodes have been remastered and released as \"Dusty Springfield Live at the BBC\", on DVD.\n\nIn 1966, Johnny Pearson also started his long association with the KPM library record label. KPM was originally known as Keith Prowse Music. KPM would later become part of the EMI Group of companies but was able to retain its independence due to its specialist nature. Pearson's involvement with KPM was to last many years until 1978, which is when he switched over his music library efforts to Bruton Music. Johnny Pearson would however again later return to KPM during 1988. That year's KPM 1000 Series double release \"Johnny Pearson Piano and Orchestra\" included several pieces featured in the second run of \"All Creatures Great and Small\", which did not have the accompanying soundtrack release that the original run did.\n\nJohnny Pearson's earliest contributions at KPM came in the form of contributing to KPM's in house orchestra, the Group-Forty Orchestra. KPM's Group-Forty Orchestra was an orchestra that existed between 1959 and 1966. Its role was to record background music for radio and television. From 1967, Johnny Pearson started appearing on many of KPM's music library recordings, in his own right.\n\nIn October 1971, Johnny Pearson helped produce the BBC Television special, \"\", featuring the American musical duo of Karen and Richard Carpenter. It was broadcast the following month on British TV and elsewhere. In early 1973, Pearson was again contacted by Richard Carpenter to ask permission to use one of his songs, on the then forthcoming Carpenters LP, \"Now & Then\". This track, originally titled \"Autumn Reverie\", first appeared on the 1968 KPM album, \"Gentle Sounds\", and was retitled \"Heather\" by producer John Bettis in the Carpenters' version. Richard Carpenter apparently first heard the track as background music for a commercial for the US health food supplement maker, Geritol, and loved it straight away. \"Autumn Reverie\" would also feature again on the 1974 Johnny Pearson LP \"Touch Me in the Morning,\" and as background music on the British television series, \"All Creatures Great and Small\" (1978–90).\n\nAs leader of the Johnny Pearson Orchestra, he reached number 8 in the United Kingdom chart in early 1972 with \"Sleepy Shores\", the theme from the television series \"Owen, M.D.\" (1971–73). The Johnny Pearson Orchestra, which as a musical project was begun in 1972, ran side by side with his other projects. At the time, these projects included working on albums with John Schroeder for Sounds Orchestral and also providing library music to Britain's KPM Records.\n\nInstead of the slightly jazzy sounding, Sounds Orchestral albums, Pearson was offered a project for easy listening and romance music, based on the success of his \"Sleepy Shores\" hit. This time he teamed up with music executive Larry Page, who wanted to move his label Penny Farthing into the easy listening genre. The albums were released outside the UK in Europe, Australia, Canada and the US. In 1978, Larry Page decided to rename his Penny Farthing label to Rampage Records, to reflect a more modern outlook. One of the first singles and albums from the Rampage label, would be another of Pearson's international hits, the eponymous theme from \"All Creatures Great and Small\".\n\nPearson was a successful composer of theme music for television series. Examples of his work included \"The Rat Catchers\", \"All Creatures Great and Small\", \"General Hospital\", \"Captain Pugwash\", \"Triangle\", \"3-2-1\", \"Mary Mungo & Midge\" and ITN's \"News at Ten\" (the last of which formed part of \"The Awakening\", a piece otherwise known to American audiences as the main title theme to the 1974 animated film \"Journey Back to Oz\"). He also wrote the score to Michael Winner's swinging 60's comedy film \"The Jokers\" (1967), the Grampian Television start-up music \"Sounds On\", and the ATV startup theme \"Midlands Montage\", as well as music used during intervals between schools programmes on ITV.\n\nIn the United States, Pearson's best-known composition is \"Heavy Action\", originally used as the theme to the BBC sports show \"Superstars\", and subsequently adopted by ABC's \"Monday Night Football\" (the NFL's weekly nationally televised showcase) and the \"SFM Holiday Network\". In 1989, Edd Kalehoff composed and recorded a new arrangement of this music for later seasons of \"Monday Night Football\". His piece \"Graveyard\" was used in \"The Ren and Stimpy Show\" and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", and his piece “Mini Walking” was used on \"Sesame Street\" as the score for the animated story segment \"Nancy the Nannygoat\" by Tee Collins and part of the score for Bill Cosby's \"Aesop's Fables\" animated special from Filmation. NFL Films has used many of his other compositions for its Super Bowl and other highlight films.\n\nPearson's \"Power Drive\" was known in the U.S. and Canada for use in some episodes of the 1967-70 cartoon series \"Spider-Man\", as well as being the theme for Los Angeles station KNXT/KCBS-TV's afternoon movie series \"The Early Show\" for much of the 1970s and into the 1980s, as well as for their Saturday night movie show \"The Fabulous 52\" from the late 1960s until the end of its run in 1974. \"Power Drive\" and \"Evening Sky,\" among others, were also used as background music by NFL Films.\n\nIn Australia, his best-known library music piece was \"Power Drive,\" which was used as the theme for the 1969-75 police drama \"Division 4\". Some of Johnny Pearson's library music was also used as background scene music for the Ten Network series, \"Prisoner\". Also during late 2011, another Johnny Pearson track, \"And a Very Good Morning to You\", from 1970, was used as a piece of background music, on the Nine Network series, \"Underbelly\". The track \"Sleepy Shores\" was also used as incidental music in some of the courting scenes from the 1970s ABC TV drama series, \"Certain Women.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Johnny Pearson composed the music score for the Dutch TV series \"Sil de Strandjutter\", performed by his orchestra. Pearson's composition \"Heather\", as performed by the Carpenters, has served as the background music to the \"Plaat & zijn Verhaal\"-section (\"A record and its story\") at Radio Veronica, in which a song's lyrics are translated into Dutch and read by the DJ. This composition, in the Carpenters' version, was also the last music to be heard before Radio Veronica went off the air in 1974.\n\nAfter leaving \"Top of the Pops\", Pearson continued to work on independent projects throughout the 1980s. In 1982, released the instrumental album \"On Golden Pond\" through Larry Page's Page One Records.\n\nIn 1984, Pearson assembled another orchestra, the Johnny Pearson Studio Orchestra, and contributed to John Paul Jones' motion picture soundtrack, \"Scream For Help\". Following this, during 1985, he worked on producing music for the BBC TV production drama \"Maelstrom\". Notable on the recordings for Maelstrom is the track \"Camellia Waltz\", which was treated to sound like an old 78rpm record. Other tracks by Pearson for the series came from his work with KPM. In 1987, together with business partner Adrian Kerridge, Pearson negotiated the purchase of CTS Studios, in Wembley. In 1988, he returned to the KPM record label and the recording of two new library CDs for the radio and television industry. Both were recorded at CTS Studios in Wembley, with Adrian Kerridge.\n\nAfter the 1980s, Pearson made occasional live appearances as part of a quartet. During 1993, Johnny Pearson worked with Shirley Bassey on a new album recording. Titled \"Shirley Bassey sings the songs of Andrew Lloyd Webber\", this was recorded at the CTS Studios. With Johnny Pearson mainly conducting, the album was subsequently released through EMI. More recently, it has now been reissued on compact disc.\n\nIn 1996, Johnny Pearson recorded a CD of library music, for the radio and television industry, titled \"Simply Piano\". This was followed in 2005 by another CD, \"Simply Piano 2\".\n\nJohnny Pearson died at the age of 85, on 20 March 2011. He is survived by Alex, his wife of many years whom he married in 1963.\n\nJohnny Pearson at one time had at least four different projects going at the same time: Sounds Orchestral, as pianist; Johnny Pearson and his Orchestra; work with KPM Records, with background music for radio and television; and as arranger with \"Top Of The Pops\". Apart from his work with John Schroeder and Sounds Orchestral, at Pye during 1964-1975, his solo work included:\n\n\nCompilations:\n\nAll the above were released on 12\" vinyl, and from 1972 to the late 1970s, on the Penny Farthing Label, with Larry Page producing. In Australia, \"Sleepy Shores\" and \"Touch Me in the Morning\" are on Festival Records. In Australia from 1976 to 1980, Johnny Pearson and his Orchestra were on M7 Records. M7 Records was the offshoot of the ATN7 Television network of Australia. In Japan, Pearson was on JVC Victor. Around 1989, multiple releases occurred to coincide with the abandonment of vinyl records by the global music industry. Titles to be found included \"Themes and Dreams\".\n\n\n\n"}

Standard Gas and Electric Company, 306 U.S. 307 (1939), was an important United States Supreme Court case in United States corporate law that laid down the \"Deep Rock doctrine\" as a rule of bankruptcy and corporate law. This holds that claims, as creditors, upon an insolvent subsidiary company by controlling shareholders or other insiders, like managers or directors, will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors.\n\nThe Deep Rock Oil Corporation was an undercapitalized subsidiary of the defendant Standard Gas Company.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that, where a subsidiary corporation declares bankruptcy and an insider or controlling shareholder of that subsidiary corporation asserts claims as a creditor against the subsidiary, loans made by the insider to the subsidiary corporation may be deemed to receive the same treatment as shares of stock owned by the insider. Therefore, the insider's claims will be subordinated to the claims of all other creditors, i.e. other creditors will be paid first, and if there is nothing left after other creditors are paid then the insider gets nothing. This also applies (and indeed the doctrine was first established) where a parent company asserts such claims against its own subsidiary.\n\nThe doctrine will be applied where equity requires, particularly where the subsidiary was undercapitalized at the time that it was established, and can thereby be shown to have been mismanaged for the parent corporation's benefit.\n\n"}

It began on January 20, 1917, as the Association of American Horse Shows, later changed to the American Horse Shows Association (AHSA). In 2001, the organization changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) and, in 2003 it merged with the United States Equestrian Team (USET). In 2017, USEF rebranded as US Equestrian. In 2019, USEF abandoned and sold its own laboratory to the University of Kentucky.\n\nCompetitions governed by US Equestrian include dressage, driving, endurance riding, eventing, hunt seat equitation, hunter, jumper, para-equestrian, reining, roadster, saddle seat equitation, vaulting, and western riding competition including equitation, western pleasure, reining, trail, western dressage, and related events.\n\nThe organization also governs breed shows held in the United States for the Andalusian, Lusitano, Arabian, Half-Arabian/Anglo-Arabian, Connemara, Friesian, Hackney, Morgan, American Saddlebred, National Show Horse, Paso Fino, Shetland, and Welsh breeds.\n\nUS Equestrian keeps track of yearly points accumulated at individual horse shows throughout the year and gives awards based on these points at the end of the year. Horse shows governed under the USEF are given an AA, A, B, or C rating. Shows with an AA rating are the most prestigious and often offer the most prize money, whereas shows with a C rating are more local, usually awarding less prize money. Competitions recognized by the USEF must follow its rules and bylaws.\n\nGoverning bodies working under the USEF include: \n\nUS Equestrian Athlete Lettering Program started by the United States Equestrian Foundation offers an incredible opportunity for junior-high and high-school equestrian athletes to receive a varsity letter, just like any other varsity high-school athlete. The Program allows young equestrian athletes to be honored and recognized for their hard work and dedication to the equestrian sport.\n\n\nOn January 20, 1917, representatives of some fifty horse shows met in Manhattan under the leadership of Reginald C. Vanderbilt. Their intention was to unite in order to assure clean competition in the show ring. They formed the Association of American Horse Shows, which by its first annual meeting on January 29, 1918, included the organizers of 26 well-known horse shows. The association incorporated in June 1918. Membership grew to list 35 member shows in 1919, and 67 shows by 1924. By the time of Vanderbilt's death in 1925, the organization had enrolled almost 70 shows as members of the organization.\n\nAlfred B. Maclay was the next individual elected president. Early in his term, in 1927, the association printed its first set of rules, consisting of a six-page pamphlet. The rules were revised continually and have been added to throughout the history of the association. When Maclay's term ended in 1936, membership included 183 shows.\n\nMaclay was followed by Pierre Lorillard as president. He served a year before Adrian Van Sinderen was elected. Under Van Sinderen, the office was relocated to 90 Broad Street in Manhattan. By the end of Van Sinderen's tenure in 1960, the rule book had grown to one hundred and sixty-eight pages.\n\nThe need for show stewards, representatives of the association to be present at and report on recognized shows, was recognized in the minutes of a 1930 executive committee meeting. It was not until the 1948 rule book that stewards were written in, however, and not until the 1960 rule book that licensing of stewards was in place and recognized in the rules.\n\nIn February 1933 the original name, the Association of American Horse Shows, Inc., was changed to the American Horse Shows Association, Inc. At the same meeting, individual members were recognized in addition to show members.\n\nIn 1935, a committee reported on their investigation of the transfer of control of the United States' membership in the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) membership from the United States Cavalry Association to the AHSA. The transfer of membership took place after the 1936 Summer Olympics, and after that, in the United States, the FEI rules applied only to international military classes. By this time, AHSA membership had grown to include 183 members and shows.\n\nBy 1937, the new rule book reflected the growth of the association by dividing the United States into five zones, each with a vice president and a five-member regional committee.\n\nIn 1939, the association began publication of the monthly magazine, \"Horse Show\", with an initial circulation of 1,200 copies. By this time there were 187 recognized shows, and 800 individual members.\n\nIn 1960, the association began sending licensed stewards to each affiliated show to report and verify that the show was following the association's rules.\n\nIn 1999, the association moved from its Manhattan office to the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nIn 2001, AHSA changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) to represent the organization's role more effectively in the United States. At that time, the organization had over 80,000 individual members. There were more than 2,700 member competitions, 100 affiliate organizations, and 26 breeds and disciplines were recognized.\n\nIn 2003, USA Equestrian and the United States Equestrian Team (USET) joined together to take on responsibilities as a national governing body and became the United States Equestrian Federation.\n\nIn 2017, USEF rebranded to US Equestrian under the new President, Murray Kessler, launching the new campaign \"Discover the Joy of Horse Sports.\"\n\nIn 2019, USEF abandoned the laboratory by selling it to the University of Kentucky. All former questionable and invalid reports generated from the USEF laboratory are now being tested by the University of Kentucky.\n"}
{"id": "2296945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2296945", "title": "NASA Astronaut Group 3", "text": "NASA Astronaut Group 3\n\nNASA Astronaut Group 3 was a group of fourteen astronauts selected by NASA. Their selection was announced in October 1963. Four died in training accidents before they could fly in space. All of the surviving ten flew in the Apollo program; five also flew Gemini missions. Aldrin, Bean, Cernan and Scott walked on the Moon.\n\nGroup 3 was the first to waive the requirement of a test pilot background, though military jet fighter aircraft experience was substituted. This applied to Aldrin, Anders, Cernan, Chaffee, Cunningham and Schweickart; all the others were test pilots. On average, its members were younger, slightly taller and heavier than the previous two groups, and better educated.\n\nThe launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, started a Cold War technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the Space Race. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public. In response to the Sputnik crisis, the U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower created a new civilian agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to oversee an American space program. The Space Task Group (STG) at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, created an American spaceflight project called Project Mercury, which aimed to send a person to space and then into orbit. The selection of the first astronauts, known as the \"Original Seven\" or \"Mercury Seven\", was announced on April 9, 1959.\n\nBy 1961, although it was yet to launch a person into space, the STG was confident that Project Mercury had overcome its initial setbacks, and the United States had overtaken the Soviet Union as the most advanced nation in space technology. The STG began considering Mercury Mark II, a two-person successor to the original Mercury spacecraft. This confidence was shattered on April 12, 1961, when the Soviet Union launched Vostok 1, and cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit the Earth. In response, President John F. Kennedy announced a far more ambitious goal on May 25, 1961: to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. This already had a name: Project Apollo. The two-person Mercury II spacecraft concept was officially named Project Gemini on January 3, 1962. On April 18, 1962, NASA formally announced that it was accepting applications for a second group of astronauts who would assist the Mercury astronauts with Project Mercury, and join them in flying Project Gemini missions. It was anticipated that they might go on to command Project Apollo missions. Nine candidates, known as the \"Next Nine\", were selected, and their names were publicly announced on September 17, 1962.\n\nBy May 1963, while there were enough astronauts for the needs of Project Gemini, the schedule for Project Apollo called for four crewed Earth-orbit missions launched by Saturn I rockets in 1965; between two and four launched by Saturn IB rockets in 1966; and six or more Earth-orbit and lunar-orbit missions launched by Saturn V rockets, commencing in 1967. On that schedule, the NASA Chief of the Astronaut Office, grounded Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton, could foresee a shortage of astronauts, although he doubted so many flights would actually be flown. Moreover, by mid-1963, three Mercury Seven astronauts—Scott Carpenter, John Glenn and himself—were no longer flying, leaving thirteen active astronauts. On that basis, he calculated an attrition rate of about ten percent per year. It followed that Project Apollo might require another ten to twenty astronauts. On June 5, 1963, NASA announced that it would be recruiting ten to fifteen new astronauts. Civilian applications had to be submitted by July 1, 1963; military ones were due by July 15, to give the services time to pre-screen their applicants.\n\nThe selection criteria were similar to those for the Next Nine, except that the minimum flight hours was lowered to 1,000, with test pilot qualification no longer required, and the maximum age was lowered to 34. The key criteria were that candidates were:\n\nA selection panel was established, consisting of Mercury Seven astronauts Deke Slayton, Alan Shepard, Wally Schirra and John Glenn, and NASA test pilot Warren J. North, the chief of the Flight Crew Operations. By the deadlines, 720 applications were received, of which 492 were from military personnel and 228 were from civilians. Of these, 490 were considered eligible, and 136 were selected for screening. The selection panel considered the applications between July 17 and 20, and picked the top 34 for further examination.\n\nThey were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for medical examinations between July 31 and August 15. Candidates were relieved that \"we were not subjected to the indignities endured by the original seven.\" Tests included cardiograms, running on treadmills, electrocephalograms, and blood sugar tests. Hypoxia tests were carried out to see how they reacted to a loss of oxygen, they were spun about in darkened rooms to test their resistance to motion sickness, and ice water was poured into one ear to test how the inner ears reacted to such an imbalance. Psychological tests included being given a blank sheet of white paper and asked what it depicted. Michael Collins, one of the few who had been through the process in 1962, said it was of polar bears having sex in the snow. Six candidates were eliminated on medical grounds.\n\nThe final stage of the selection process were interviews by the selection panel, which were conducted at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston between September 2 and 7. Collins felt that the interview was easier the second time around. The panellists were no longer strangers, the questions they asked were no longer unpredictable, and he had the benefit of having attended the United States Air Force (USAF) Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS). He recalled that \"even Deke Slayton and Warren North seem to have mellowed a bit\". Slayton had developed a points system for assessing the candidates. Ten points each were allocated to academics, pilot performance, and character and motivation, for a possible score of thirty points.\n\nSlayton then took thirteen names to a meeting chaired by the MSC director, Robert R. Gilruth. Maxime Faget, his director of engineering and development, had an objection: thirteen was an unlucky number. So Slayton added the next candidate, Walter Cunningham, to the list. The successful candidates received phone calls from Slayton; unsuccessful ones got calls from North or Jack G. Cairl from NASA public relations. Four of the unsuccessful finalists would later become NASA astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966: Vance Brand, Ronald Evans, James Irwin and Jack Swigert. Another finalist, Michael J. Adams, would be posthumously awarded his Astronaut Wings for X-15 Flight 3-65-97. The official announcement of the astronaut selection was made at a press conference at the MSC in Houston on October 18. The new astronauts became known as \"The Fourteen\".\n\nSeven of the Fourteen were from the USAF: Major Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin and Captains William Anders, Charles Bassett, Michael Collins, Donn Eisele, Theodore Freeman and David Scott. Four were from the United States Navy: Lieutenant Commander Richard Gordon and Lieutenants Alan Bean, Gene Cernan and Roger Chaffee. Captain Clifton (C.C.) Williams was from the United States Marine Corps. There were two civilians: Walter Cunningham, who was a captain in the Marine Corps Reserve; and Russell (Rusty) Schweickart, who was a captain in the Massachusetts Air National Guard. \"In retrospect,\" Collins noted, \"we were in the same tradition as the previous two groups, despite the press's natural tendency to highlight differences.\"\n\nAll were married except for Williams, who became the first bachelor astronaut. Their average age at the time of selection was 31, compared with 34.5 for the Mercury Seven and 32.5 for the Next Nine. They were slightly taller, at , compared with for the Seven and for the Nine. Their average weight was higher too: compared to for the Seven and for the Nine. Flying time was lower; whereas the Seven had averaged 3,500 hours, of which 1,700 was in jets, and the Nine had averaged 2,800 hours with 1,900 in jets, the Fourteen had an average of 2,300 hours, with 1,800 in jets. Educational achievement was a major differentiator. While six of the Nine had bachelor's degrees, and three had master's degrees, only six of the Fourteen had only bachelor's degree, and three of them were working on their master's, seven had master's degrees, and Cunningham was working on his doctorate, and Buzz Aldrin had a Doctor of Science degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAll were male and white. President John F. Kennedy was disturbed at the lingering discrimination against African Americans in particular in the armed services, and in 1962 he brought pressure to bear on the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Curtis LeMay to nominate an African-American astronaut candidate. The USAF selected Captain Edward J. Dwight Jr., a B-57 pilot with 2,000 hours in high-performance jets, an aeronautical engineering degree from Arizona State University, and outstanding performance reviews, for training at the USAF Test Pilot School. Dwight graduated with Class 62-C in April 1963. He was the third African American to attend, after John L. Whitehead Jr., who had graduated in 1958, and Joseph C. Watts, a civilian, in 1960. The fourth would be Robert Henry Lawrence Jr. in 1966; by 1984, six had graduated.\n\nDwight then applied for the ARPS, and Robert F. Kennedy told LeMay to ensure that he was accepted. The commandant, Colonel Chuck Yeager, protested, saying that there were other pilots that had been rated higher than Dwight. All were accepted, so Class IV had fourteen members instead of the usual eight. \"Why in Hell would a colored guy want to go into space anyway?\" Yeager asked, adding: \"And if it was left to me, you guys wouldn't even get a chance to wear an Air Force uniform.\" Dwight was ranked eighth in his class. Along with the seven ahead of him, Dwight was recommended by the USAF for NASA astronaut training in July 1963. Dwight was not one of the final candidates, although classmates Scott and Freeman, were.\n\nThe fourteen were given classroom instruction, which Collins felt was useful \"to bridge the gap between aeronautics and astronautics, to minimize the technological shock we might otherwise experience\". The 240-hour course covered astronomy (12 hours), aerodynamics (8 hours), rockets (12 hours), communications (8 hours), space medicine (12 hours), meteorology (5 hours), upper atmospheric physics (12 hours), navigation (34 hours), orbital mechanics (40 hours), computers (36 hours) and geology (58 hours).\nThe geology classes were a special case, as they were for all astronauts, not just the fourteen. The training in geology included field trips to the Grand Canyon and Meteor Crater in Arizona, Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico, Horse Lava Tube System in Bend, Oregon, and the ash flow in the Marathon Uplift in Texas. There was also jungle survival training for the Fourteen in Panama, and desert survival training around Reno, Nevada. Water survival training was conducted at Naval Air Station Pensacola using the Dilbert Dunker.\n\nAs the Mercury Seven and the Next Nine had done, each of the fourteen was given an individual area in which to develop expertise that could be shared with the others, and to provide astronaut input to designers and engineers: Aldrin was given mission planning; Anders, environment controls; Bassett, training and simulators; Bean, recovery systems; Cernan, spacecraft propulsion and the Agena; Chaffee, communications; Collins, pressure suits and extravehicular activity; Cunningham, non-flight experiments; Eisele, attitude controls; Freeman, boosters; Gordon, cockpit controls; Schweickart, in-flight experiments; Scott, guidance and navigation; and Williams, range operations and crew safety.\n\nThe fourteen were divided between two branches. The Apollo branch was headed by Mercury Seven astronaut Gordon Cooper. It included Pete Conrad from the Nine, and Anders, Cernan, Chaffee, Cunningham, Eisele, Freeman, Gordon and Schweickart from the fourteen. The operations branch was headed by Nine astronaut Neil Armstrong. Assigned to it were Elliot See from the Nine, and Aldrin, Bassett, Bean, Collins, Scott and Williams from the Fourteen.\n\nThe Fourteen suffered a high death rate. Bassett, Freeman and Williams were killed in T-38 crashes, and Chaffee in the Apollo 1 fire, before they had a chance to fly in space. All the rest flew at least once; Aldrin, Bean, Collins and Gordon flew twice, and Cernan and Scott flew three times. Aldrin, Anders, Bean, Cernan, Collins, Gordon and Scott flew to the Moon (Cernan twice), and Aldrin, Bean, Cernan and Scott walked on it.\n\nMultimedia\n"}

In this episode, Dr. Julian Bashir is assigned \"babysitting\" duty for four visiting ambassadors, Chief Miles O'Brien deals with an alien computer program downloaded from a probe, and Odo copes with a deeply infatuated Lwaxana Troi.\n\nDeep Space Nine is host to a delegation of Federation ambassadors, and Captain Benjamin Sisko gives Bashir the \"honor\" of welcoming them to the station. While Bashir struggles to please the other three dignitaries, Ambassador Lwaxana Troi exclaims that someone has stolen her brooch. Odo apprehends the thief, and Lwaxana is instantly infatuated with the Constable.\n\nLater, Lwaxana comes to Odo’s office to flirt with him. Odo is uncomfortable with her attention, and escapes on a pretext. In Sisko's office, Odo asks for advice on how to deal with Lwaxana's aggressive behavior, but Sisko is amused and offers no help.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious probe-like vessel comes through the Wormhole. Dax and O'Brien attempt to analyze it, downloading its software to Deep Space Nine.\n\nAs Lwaxana follows Odo into a turbolift, he tries to rebuff her by telling her that he must revert to a liquid every sixteen hours, but she is undeterred. A system failure strands them together in the turbolift. As Lwaxana talks to keep her mind off the danger, Odo grows less hostile toward her, and soon opens up to her about his past. He is in severe discomfort, as he will soon need to revert to his liquid state.\n\nWhile trying to repair the station's systems, O'Brien discovers that the computer is less hostile to him than usual, but it seems to break down whenever he is away from it. Dax and Kira infer that the information downloaded from the alien probe is a non-sentient life form, which has attached itself to O'Brien like a puppy.\n\nThe crew attempt to transfer the alien life form's files off the station, but something goes awry and a plasma surge creates a fire that endangers Bashir and the ambassadors. O'Brien finally decides to build a \"doghouse\" within the computer for their little lost puppy. Containing it solves their problems. \n\nMeanwhile, in the turbolift, Odo begins to lose control of his form. Lwaxana tries to be supportive, but he turns away and says no one has ever seen him this way. She takes off her wig and tells him no one has ever seen her that way either. As they bond over their shared moment of vulnerability, she lets Odo \"melt\" into her lap.\n\nBashir saves the ambassadors from the fire by hiding in a crawlspace. Upon emerging, they call him a hero. Odo and Lwaxana are rescued from the turbolift with a newfound appreciation for each other’s company. Sisko agrees to allow O’Brien to “keep the puppy.”\n\nReviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen wrote, \"In her way, Lwaxana is as much a misfit as Odo, whether by her choosing, or else by some fundamental aspect of her personality that drives her to make her choices. At the end of the episode, Lwaxana flirts one last time before walking off, and for once, the sight didn’t make me flinch. She may not be the easiest person in the world to deal with, but some people are worth the effort.\"\n\nJamahl Epsicokhan gave the episode a mixed review for Jammer's Review, writing \"'The Forsaken,' much like '' and ',' highlights how DS9 can deliver with character insight and development almost every time, even when the plotline fails to be remotely compelling.\" He added, \"What doesn't work here is the completely routine computer-induced mania and its predictable wrap-up, and the unnecessary imperilment of Bashir and the ambassadors in the lackluster finale. The characters work, but the story lacks originality.\"\n\nIn 2013, Keith DeCandido gave the episode a warp factor rating of 6/10 for Tor.com, writing, \"The corridor explodes, everyone panics, we don’t know what’s happened, and then we find out that Bashir got them into a crawlway, and apparently they bonded while trapped in there, because they’re all friends now. I would rather have been shown that than told it. (Although the look on Kira’s face when she realizes that Bashir saved the day is priceless, and a particularly good example of how great Nana Visitor is with facial expressions.)\"\n\nIn 2019, Io9 noted \"The Forsaken\" for pairing the characters Odo and Lwaxana.\n\n"}

When Robert was five years old his father was reduced to poverty, forced to work as a day-labourer. His mother, Grace Fenwick, was able to compensate for his father's inability to give his son more than a slight education by teaching Robert and his siblings to read and write. Robert had eight siblings and he was the second son; however, his older brother died as a child, making him the oldest son. His mother, Grace, recalled that Robert was such a quick child, that he was speaking at nine months in the way of an eighteen-month old child - a genius from the very beginning. At five years old, Robert was reading the New Testament. When the Nicoll family became extremely poor, Robert's mother did not have time to read, which was a great passion of hers. To entertain her while she was working or tending to the household, Robert would read books deemed appropriate for his age group. He studied under several teachers, most notably a Mr. Marshall, who died young. Hearing of his death, Robert wrote to his mother, lamenting, \"In fine, he was a young man who has left few equals. I myself owe more to him than years can repay. I could read before I knew him, but he taught me to think.\" Another instructor, James Anderson of Tullybeltane was a poet himself.\n\nAt 16 the boy was apprenticed to a grocer and wine-merchant at Perth. Nicoll is quoted in \"The Life of Robert Nicoll\" as stating, \"to further my progress in life, I bound myself apprentice to Mrs. J. H. Robertson, wine-merchant and grocer in Perth.  When I came to Perth, I bought Cobbett's \"English Grammar\", and by constant study soon made myself master of it, and then commenced writing as before; and you know the result.\" Regardless of the barriers he faced, Robert pursued his academic journey, aware of the value of his intelligence even at the age of 16.\n\nIn 1833 he began to contribute to \"Johnstone's Magazine\" (later \"Tait's Magazine\"), and in the next year his apprenticeship was cancelled. He visited Edinburgh, and was kindly received there, but obtained no employment. However, in 1835, he published \"Poems and Lyrics\" with Edinburgh printer William Tait, which was dedicated to the popular Scottish authoress \"Mrs. Johnstone\" (Christian Isobel Johnstone). In critics' opinion, the best of Nicoll's lyrics are those written in the Scottish dialect. Due to this circumstance, and his precocity as a writer of verse and prose, Nicoll was often compared to fellow Scottish poet Robert Burns. One of Nicoll's most famous poems, featured in \"The Monthly Miscellany of Religion and Letters\" in 1840 is \"God is Everywhere,\" which begins:\n\nAfter this publication, Nicolls opened a circulating library at Dundee, and in 1836 became editor of the \"Leeds Times\". Additionally, he was a member of the provisional committee of the Leeds Working Men's Association and of the Leeds Radical Association. While in Dundee, he took on a work-partner, a local tradesman who was also in desperate need of money. Robert realized that this partnership was a poor choice, since the library business could barely sustain one person, let alone two. In 1836, Robert gave the business over to his partner completely. As he had left the business without gaining anything, his losses concerned his mother, who was in a great measure responsible for his ambitions.\n\nIn the midst of a frigid winter and worsening health, on 9 December 1836, Robert Nicoll married Alice Griffiths Suter (or Soutar), the niece of Mr. Peter Brown, editor of the \"Dundee Advertiser\" in Dundee. Though the marriage was happy, the couple were under immense financial stress to pay off Nicoll's debts, support themselves, and care for Alice's mother, Mrs. Suter, who came to live with them.\n\nEspousing pronounced Radical opinions, Nicoll overtaxed his slender physical resources in electioneering work for Sir William Molesworth in the summer of 1837. Due to the stress and pure exhaustion of the election, he was obliged to resign his successful editorship due to decreasing health. His final letter to his mother dated 13 September 1837 admits the severity of his illness, and explains that he did not tell her because he knew it would keep her unsettled. His appetite lessened due to his medications, accelerating the conclusion to his prolonged decline. He died on December 7, 1837, at the house of his friend William Tait, at Trinity, near Edinburgh, after a long battle with an illness caused by stress, exhaustion and lack of proper appetite and rest. He is buried in North Leith Burial Ground in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nIn 1844, the second edition of \"Poems and Lyrics\" appeared with an anonymous memoir of the author by Christian Isobel Johnstone. An appreciation of Nicoll's character and his poetry was included in Charles Kingsley's article on Burns and his School in the \"North British Review\" for November 1851. In 1884, Peter Robert Drummond wrote a detailed autobiography entitled, \"\" The poem \"We are Lowly\" was set to music by Sophia Dobson Colett.\n\n\n"}

A fragment of detritus is called a clast. Detrital particles can consist of lithic fragments (particles of recognisable rock), or of monomineralic fragments (mineral grains). These particles are often transported through sedimentary processes into depositional systems such as riverbeds, lakes or the ocean, forming sedimentary successions. Diagenetic processes can transform these sediments into rock through cementation and lithification, forming sedimentary rocks such as sandstone. These rocks can then in turn again be weathered and eroded to form a second generation of sediment.\n\n"}

The total distance was .\n\nTaking place on the eve of World War II, there was already much animosity in Europe. Italy, Germany and Spain all declined to send teams to the race, so the 1938 Italian champion Gino Bartali would not be defending his title. To fill out the ranks, Belgium sent two teams, and France had five teams. This would be the final Tour for eight years, until 1947.\n\nBetween the second and the seventh stage, the last rider in the general classification was eliminated.\n\nThe race was won by Belgian Sylvère Maes who also won the mountains classification.\n\nFor the first time, a mountain time trial was scheduled: stage 16b.\nA rule was added to make it more difficult to finish the race: from the second stage to the seventh stage, the last rider in the classification was to be removed from the race.\n\nThe nutrition of the cyclists became more professional: cyclists were reporting that the use of vitamins increased their performance.\n\nBecause Italy, Germany and Spain did not send teams, the Tour organisation were short on participating cyclists. To solve this, they allowed Belgium to send two teams, and France to send four additional regional teams.\n\nThe French cyclists had been successful in the 1930s, but their Tour winners were absent in 1939: 1930 and 1932 winner André Leducq had retired in 1938, as had 1931 and 1934 winner Antonin Magne; 1933 winner Georges Speicher did not ride, and 1937 winner Roger Lapébie was injured. This all made the Belgian team favourite.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 16b.\n\nIn the first stage, regional Amedée Fournier won the sprint of a group of nine cyclists, and was the first cyclist in 1939 to wear the yellow jersey. In the next stage, Romain Maes, who had finished in the same group as Fournier, won the time trial, and captured the lead. He lost it in the second part of that stage, when a group got away. Three regional riders were now on top of the general classification, led by Jean Fontenay.\n\nRené Vietto, leader of the regional South-East team, was in second place. In the fourth stage, Vietto got into the winning break, and took over the lead, closesly followed by Mathias Clemens on six seconds.\n\nIn the ninth stage, the single Pyrenees stage of 1939, Edward Vissers attacked instead of helping his team leader Sylvère Maes. Vissers won the stage, but Vietto was able to stay with Maes. Maes climbed to the second place in the general classification, three minutes behind Vietto.\n\nMaes was able to win back a little time, and just before the Alps were climbed from stage 15 on, Vietto was still leading, with Maes still in second place, two minutes behind. Sylvère Maes attacked on that stage, and Vietto was not able to follow. Vietto finished 17 minutes behind Maes, and lost the lead. The next stage was split in three split stages. In the first part, Vietto was able to stay close to Maes, but in the second part, the individual mountain time trial, Maes won ten minutes on Vietto. Maes was now leading with a margin of 27 minutes, and the victory seemed secure.\n\nIn the last stages, Maes was able to extend his lead with a few more minutes. Maes became the winner, with a margin of more than half an hour.\n\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Of the 79 cyclists that started the race, 49 finished.\n\nFor the mountains classification, 10 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation. The mountains classification in 1939 was won by Sylvère Maes. The first cyclist to reach the top received 10 points, the second cyclist 9 points, and so on until the tenth cyclist who received 1 point.\n\nThe team classification was calculated in 1939 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. In 1939, there were ten teams of eight cyclists. There were the national teams of Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and France. Belgium also sent a second team, \"Belgium B\". Finally, there were four regional French teams: North-East, West, South-West and South-East. The South-West team was registered with eight cyclist, but only seven cyclists started the race. Only two of the South-West cyclists finished the race, so they were not in the team classification.\n\nAlthough he did not win the race, René Vietto became a popular cyclist. He was the most popular runner-up in France until Raymond Poulidor.\n\nThe sales of the organising newspaper \"l'Auto\" had dropped to 164000, and the newspaper was sold to Raymond Patenôtre. A few months after Germany had conquered France in the Second World War, Patenôtre sold l'Auto to the Germans.\n\nDirectly after the Tour, the organisation announced the 1940 Tour de France would be run in 20 stages and five rest days. But the Second World War made it impossible to hold a Tour de France in the next years, although some replacing races were held. Only in 1947 would the Tour be held again, and Vietto would again play an important role then, holding the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification for 15 of the 21 stages.\n\nThe victory of Maes would be the last Belgian Tour victory for 30 years, until Eddy Merckx won the 1969 Tour de France.\n\n"}

They often exhibit both textural and compositional maturity. The two primary sedimentary depositional environments that produce quartz arenites are beaches/upper shoreface and aeolian processes, due to their high residence time, high transport distance, and/or high energy of the environment. Most of the time, these sediments are reworked over and over, even being eroded out of a lithified rock and becoming a brand new sediment and rock. This is known as a multicycle sand.\n\n"}

It was constructed as a coastal defense of New Orleans, between 1822 and 1832, and it was a battle site during the American Civil War. It is a National Historic Landmark. It was damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and its condition is threatened. It is marked Battery Millar on some maps, for the Endicott era work built nearby it.\n\nFort Jackson is situated approximately south of New Orleans on the western bank of the Mississippi, approximately south of Triumph, Louisiana. The older Fort St. Philip is located opposite of Fort Jackson on the eastern bank; this West Bank fort was constructed after the War of 1812 on the advice of Andrew Jackson, for whom it is named.\n\nThe fort was occupied off and on for various military purposes from its completion until after World War I, when it served as a training station. It is now a National Historic Landmark and historical museum owned and operated by Plaquemines Parish.\n\nFort Jackson was the site of the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip from April 16 to April 28, 1862, during the American Civil War. The Confederate-controlled fort was besieged for 12 days by the fleet of U.S. Navy Flag Officer David Farragut. Fort Jackson fell on April 28 after the Union fleet bombarded it and then sailed past its guns. A mutiny against the officers and conditions then occurred and the fort fell to the Union. Union forces then went on to capture New Orleans.\n\nFollowing the engagement, Fort Jackson was used as a Union prison. It was here that the French champagne magnate Charles Heidsieck was held for seven months on charges of spying.\n\nThe fort was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It has been owned by Plaquemines Parish since 1962. In the 1960s, Leander Perez threatened to turn Fort St. Philip into a prison for advocates of desegregation (\"outside agitators\") who entered the Parish. The fort site was later opened as a park.\n\nThe fort was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina's storm surge in 2005. Between Katrina and Hurricane Rita the following month, much of the fort sat under water for up to six weeks. Many of the historic exhibits in the fort were destroyed, and the fort itself suffered structural damage.\n\nThe fort was used to treat oily birds in the early weeks of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The treatment facility was moved on July 4, 2010, to Hammond, Louisiana, in order to make it less vulnerable to hurricanes.\n\n\n"}

The total distance was and the average speed of the riders was . It was won by the Belgian cyclist Philippe Thys.\n\nThe day the Tour began, Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo, marking the start of World War I. On 3 August Germany invaded Belgium and declared war on France, making this Tour the last for five years, until 1919. The three men who won the Tour between 1907 and 1910 would die in the war.\n\nNot much changed from the 1913 Tour de France, the most important novelty was the introduction of frame numbers.\n\nPhilippe Thys, who had won the 1913 Tour de France, was returning in 1914 and considered favourite, together with his teammate Henri Pélissier. Apart from him six other previous Tour de France winners started the race: Louis Trousselier, Lucien Petit-Breton, Octave Lapize, François Faber, Odile Defraye and Gustave Garrigou. Four more cyclists started the race that would later win a Tour de France: Firmin Lambot, Léon Scieur, Henri Pélissier and Lucien Buysse. This number of 11 former or future Tour de France winners on the start line is a record. In addition, Italian champion Costante Girardengo, started the race, but Girardengo was not yet the champion from 1919 on, and was not the team leader.\n\nIn 1914, the first cyclists from Australia started the Tour de France, Don Kirkham and Iddo Munro. They also finished the race, in 17th place and 20th place.\n\nThe cyclists used whistles, to warn other persons that they were coming (mainly downhill).\n\nThys was dominant in the entire race. Even though he only won the first stage, he finished in the top five every other stage.\nIn that first stage, Jean Rossius finished second with the same time. The second stage was won by Rossius, with Thys in the same time. Both had the same time, and the same finishing places, so they were both given the lead in the general classification.\n\nIn the third stage, the riders reached the first check point one hour late, after they had taken the wrong route and rode 30 km in the wrong direction. The race was then stopped and restarted from the first check point.\n\nThe lead remained shared between Rossius and Thys until after the fifth stage, when Thys got away from Rossius. After that stage, Pélissier was third in the classification with only 5'27\" behind.\n\nIn the sixth stage, the Pyrenees mountains appeared. The stage was won by Lambot, with Thys only 7 minutes behind. The other competitors did worse, with Pélissier losing over 30 minutes and Rossius over one hour. Thys was firmly in the lead. In that stage, Ali Neffati was hit by a car from the organization, and could not continue. According to the rules, he did not have to finish the stage, and was given a time which allowed him to keep his 42nd place in the overall classification. In the sixth stage, Girardengo crashed again, and retired from the Tour, never to come back.\n\nThe weather was hot, and in the eighth stage, the cyclists did not want to race and cycled at a low speed. Tour organiser Henri Desgrange then stopped the race, and organised a sprint tournament, with semifinals and finals, which was won by Octave Lapize. In the ninth stage, former winner Faber was penalised with 90 minutes, because he had been pushed and took drinks from a motor cyclist.\n\nPélissier, still in second place, had done his best to win back time, but he only managed to win back a few minutes. After the thirteenth stage, he was still 31 minutes and 50 seconds behind.\nIn the 14th stage to Dunkerque, Thys' bicycle broke. It was not allowed to get help while fixing your bicycle, and in the 1913 Tour de France, Eugene Christophe lost his chances of a victory by repairing his own bicycle. Thys decided to take the risk of a time penalty, and bought a new wheel at a shop. This cost him a 30-minute penalty, which left Thys with only 1:50 ahead of Pélissier. Pélissier did his best to overcome the gap, but Thys followed him. In the stage to Dunkerque, Pélissier claimed spectators prevented him from getting away from Thys. In the end, Thys stayed less than two minutes ahead of Henri Pélissier, and managed to keep that margin until the finish in Paris.\n\nIn each stage, all cyclists started together. The cyclist who reached the finish first, was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader.\n\nCamille Botte, ranked 15 in the general classification, became the winner of the \"isolés\" category. The \"isolés\" classification was calculated in the same way as the general classification, but only the isolated cyclists (not part of a team) were eligible.\n\nThe organising newspaper l'Auto named Firmin Lambot the \"meilleur grimpeur\". This unofficial title is the precursor to the mountains classification.\n\nOne week after the race ended, Germany had declared war on France, starting World War I in France. This made the organization of a big cycling race impossible for the next four years, and the Tour de France would start again in 1919. By that time, Tour de France champions Lucien Petit-Breton, François Faber and Octave Lapize had died in the first world war.\nThe winner of the 1914 Tour de France, Philippe Thys, would survive the war, and go on for his third victory in 1920. Henri Pélissier, the runner-up, would win the Tour de France in 1923.\n\n"}

It formerly served as military protection of New Orleans, some up the river, and of the lower Mississippi River.\n\nThe first fort on this location, Fort San Felipe, was constructed in the 18th century during the period of Spanish control of Louisiana.\n\nThe fort served a role in protecting the United States from the British invasion during the War of 1812, seeing ten days of battle in January 1815, the 9th to the 18th, inclusive. Specifically, the fort held its defenses against British Navy vessels who were bombarding it, in a final attempt to invade Louisiana following the defeat of the British Army near New Orleans.\n\nThe current fort was constructed, along with Fort Jackson, as a coastal defense for New Orleans and the Mississippi, upon the urging of Andrew Jackson.

The community members numbered as many as 16 at any one time and were known as the Christos family. They lived in four buildings—three two-story officers quarters and an officers club—that remained from the re-fortification of the site during the 1898 Spanish–American War.\n\nFort St. Philip remains privately owned and in a state of bad deterioration. It was heavily damaged in 2005 during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. According to the National Park Service, the owner reported that only the original brick fort and the concrete structures from the time of the Spanish–American War remain.\n\nThe site is accessible only by boat or helicopter, and following erosion of the small levee is now subject to flooding during high water levels of the Mississippi River.\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth installment in the handheld version of the \"Mega Man\" series. The game continues the quest of the protagonist Mega Man in the struggle with his long-time nemesis Dr. Wily, who sends out a disruptive radio signal to cause a rampage, citywide destruction from dormant robots. \"Mega Man IV\" features the traditional action platforming gameplay of the prior games while introducing one new feature, the ability to purchase items with power-ups found throughout each stage. As with previous Game Boy releases, the game incorporates gameplay elements and bosses from two sequential Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games: \"Mega Man 4\" and \"Mega Man 5\". The game has received a warm critical reception. In 2013, \"Mega Man IV\" was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.\n\nThe plot of the game once again involves the protagonist Mega Man trying to thwart the world domination plans of the infamous Dr. Wily. On a seemingly peaceful day in a large city, Wily appears in the sky in his flying saucer and sends out a radio transmission that causes all the robots at the annual Robot Master Exposition to go on a rampage. He then sends eight new rebuilt robots of his own to different parts of the city to lead the destruction. Having resisted this reprogramming signal, Mega Man responds by defeating all four of these previous foes in battle and chases Wily to a large tank. Inside the tank, the hero encounters Ballade, yet another robot specially designed to kill him. Mega Man defeats this new enemy, pursues the remaining enemies in the city, and returns to the tank. There, he has a victorious rematch with Ballade, only to see Wily quickly retreat to his space station. Dr. Light fits Mega Man's companion Rush with a space flight ability, allowing the hero to lead a one-man assault on Wily's new stronghold. Mega Man beats Wily, but is unable to blast his way out of the exploding space station. At the last moment, Ballade arrives and self-destructs in repentance, creating a hole through which Mega Man can safely escape.\n\nAt its core, the gameplay is still the same as the previous 3 \"Mega Man\" Game Boy games. The player takes on the role of Mega Man as he traverses a series of two sets of selectable action/platforming stages in any order desired. The player's initial weapon, the \"Mega Buster\", can fire both small shots and much larger and more powerful, charged blasts. Each stage is populated with various types of enemy robots and a single Robot Master exclusive boss. Beating the Robot Master will earn the player its special \"Master Weapon\" for use throughout the rest of the game. Clearing 2 of the Robot stages also gives the player access to abilities from Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a springboard for reaching high platforms or a jet for crossing large distances. Also, the game's first four Robot stages each house a letter (\"B-E-A-T\") that spell out the name of the bird Beat. Collecting all 4 letters endows the player the ability to summon upon Beat to assist by attacking enemies. On the other hand, the game's latter four Robot stages each house letters that spell (\"W-I-L-Y\") which would be imperative to collect in entering to the first part of Dr. Wily's fortress. The stages also contain hidden passages where the character Proto Man leaves the player items, often giving \"Super Tanks\" that refill all weapons energy and health energy.\n\n\"Mega Man IV\" carries on the Game Boy line's tradition of recycling elements from two consecutive \"Mega Man\" NES releases, most prominently with its bosses. The first four Robot Masters (Toad Man, Bright Man, Pharaoh Man, and Ring Man) are originally from \"Mega Man 4\" and the latter four (Crystal Man, Napalm Man, Stone Man, and Charge Man) are from \"Mega Man 5\". \"Mega Man IV\" also introduces a shop feature to the series. In addition to various restorative items like health, weapon power, extra lives, energy tanks that can be stored for later use, the player can pick up \"Power Chips (P-Chips)\" dropped by enemies or in designated spots in the stages. Dr. Light's lab can also be visited from the stage select screen, wherein the player can purchase various items using the P-Chips collected. One such item is the newly introduced \"Auto Charger\" (or \"Energy Balancer\", which was originally conceived for Mega Man 5 but removed), which automatically takes weapon energy capsules and restores it in the weapon with the least amount of energy left, provided that there is no refillable special weapon selected.\n\nAlso, for the first time in the \"Mega Man\" Game Boy series, the Robot Master re-match sequence (where Mega Man must fight all 8 Robot Masters again in a teleportation hatch in Dr. Wily's castle) is implemented, as opposed to the previous three \"Mega Man\" Game Boy titles, where Mega Man fought Wily straight on after going through the castle.\n\nUsing features from two previous NES titles, as well as some new elements, series artist Keiji Inafune was happy with the flow from \"Mega Man III\" to \"Mega Man IV\". Inafune was also satisfied with how the Mega Man Killers Enker, Punk, and Ballade turned out. The artist had fun thinking up new ideas for Ballade's second form, which included the horns on his head turning up, larger bombs, and shades covering his eyes.\n\n\"Mega Man IV\" has been well-received critically. Major gaming magazines \"Nintendo Power\" and \"Game Players\" have called the graphics and gameplay \"exceptional\" and \"terrific\", although the former was disappointed by its few surprises. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" described \"Mega Man IV\" as one of the best Game Boy games to date, due to its near flawless recreation of the action and technique of the home console games and graphics which push the Game Boy hardware \"to its limits and then some\" (though they did complain of screen blurring). They also praised the music and the extremely long, challenging levels.\n\n\"Mega Man IV\" was re-released on April 13, 2001 for the Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan alongside its four Game Boy counterparts. The 5 games that comprise this subseries were to be released on a Game Boy Advance compilation in 2004, but was cancelled. The boss Ballade would later appear as part of a downloadable content stage for \"Mega Man 10\" in 2010. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man IV is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console which came out in October 23, 2013 in Japan and on May 15, 2014 in North America.\n\n"}

{"id": "2297050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297050", "title": "Battir", "text": "Battir\n\nBattir () is a Palestinian village in the West Bank, 6.4 km west of Bethlehem, and southwest of Jerusalem. It was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000.\n\nIn 2014, Battir was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, as \"Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem, Battir\".\n\nAncient Betar, whose name Battir preserves, was a second-century Jewish village and fortress, the site of the final battle of the Bar Kokhba revolt. The modern Palestinian village is built north east of the ancient site \"Khirbet el-Yahud\" (Arabic, meaning \"ruin of the Jews\" ) and \"is unanimously identified with Betar, the last stronghold of the Second Revolt against the Romans, where its leader, Bar-Kokhba, found his death in 135 CE.\" \"A modern agricultural terrace follows the line of the ancient fortification wall\". There is a tradition that the village is also the site of the tomb of the Tannaic sage Eleazar of Modi'im.\n\nA mosaic from the late Byzantine or early Muslim period was found in Battir.\n\nIn 1596, Battir appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the \"Nahiya\" of Quds in the \"Liwa\" of Quds. It had a population of 24 households and two bachelors, all Muslims, and paid taxes on wheat, summer crops or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,800 Akçe. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.\n\nIn 1838 it was noted as \"Bittir\", a Muslim village in the \"Beni Hasan\" district, west of Jerusalem.\n\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin visited the place in 1863, while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Battir had a population of 239, in a total of 62 houses, though that population count only included men. It was further noted that it had \"a beautiful spring flowing through the courtyard of the mosque\".\n\nIn 1883, the PEF's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" described Battir as a moderate sized village, on the precipitous slope of a deep valley.\n\nIn 1896 the population of \"Bettir\" was estimated to be about 750 persons.\n\nIn the 20th century, Battir's development was linked to its location alongside the railroad to Jerusalem, which provided access to the marketplace as well as income from passengers who disembarked to refresh themselves en route.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Batir had an all Muslim population of 542 persons, increasing in the 1931 census to 758; 755 Muslims, two Christians and one Jew, in 172 houses.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Battir was 1,050, all Muslims, with a total of 8,028 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,805 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 2,287 for cereals, while 73 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nDuring the 1948 war, most of the villagers had fled, but Mustafa Hassan and a few others stayed. At night they would light candles in the houses, and in the morning they would take out the cattle. When nearing the village, the Israelis thought Battir was still inhabited and gave up attacking. The armistice line was drawn near the railroad, with Battir ending up just meters to the east of Jordan's border with Israel. At least 30% of Battir's land lies on the Israeli side of the Green Line, but the villagers were allowed to keep it in return for preventing damage to the railway, thus being the only Palestinians officially allowed to cross into Israel and work their lands before the Six-Day War.\n\nBattir came under Jordanian administration following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and was later, in a move not widely recognized internationally, annexed by Jordan on 24 April 1950 when the Jordanian parliament declared the unification of the two banks.\n\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,321 inhabitants in Battir.\n\nSince the Six-Day War in 1967, Battir has been under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 1445.\n\nSince the signing of the 1995 accords, it has been administered by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Battir is governed by a village council currently administrated by nine members appointed by the PNA. 23.7% of Battir land was classified as Area B, while the remaining 76.3% was classified as Area C.\n\nIn 2007, Battir had a population of 3,967, in 2012 the population was estimated at about 4,500.\n\nBattir is located 6.4 km (horizontal distance) north-west of Bethlehem on a hill above Wadi el-Jundi (lit. \"Valley of the Soldier\"), which runs southwest through the Judean hills to the coastal plain. The PEF's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" in 1883 described the city's natural defenses, saying its houses stand upon rock terraces, having a rocky scarp below; thus from the north the place is very strong, whilst on the south a narrow neck between two ravine heads connects the hill with the main ridge. At an altitude of around 760 m above sea level, Battir's summers are temperate, and its winters mild with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 16 C.\n\nBattir has a unique irrigation system that utilizes man-made terraces and a system of manually diverting water via sluice gates. The Roman-era network is still in use, fed by seven springs which have provided fresh water for 2,000 years. The irrigation system runs through a steep valley near the Green Line where a section of the Ottoman-era Hejaz Railway was laid. Battir's eight main clans take turns each day to water the village's crops. Hence a local saying that in Battir \"a week lasts eight days, not seven.\" According to anthropologist Giovanni Sontana of UNESCO, \"There are few, if any, places left in the immediate region where such a traditional method of agriculture remains, not only intact, but as a functioning part of the village.\"\n\nIn 2007, the village of Battir sued the Israeli Defense Ministry to try to force them to change the planned route of the Israeli West Bank barrier which would cut through part of Battir's 2,000-year-old irrigation system, which is still in use. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), which approved the fence’s original route in 2005, changed its mind and wrote in a 13-page policy paper that Battir’s terraces were also an Israeli heritage site and should be carefully safeguarded, stating that agricultural terraces around Battir attesting to millennia-old methods of farming in the region will be irreversibly harmed by the fence, no matter how narrow its route. It was the first time an Israeli government agency expressed opposition to the construction of a segment of the fence. This affidavit was one of four expert opinions that contended the fence would decimate the unique farming system, and in early May 2013, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the Defense Ministry must explain “why should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured.” The Defense Ministry has to submit a new plan for securing the border that will not destroy Battir by July 2, 2013. A separate petition against the separation barrier has also been filed by the nearby Jewish city Beitar Illit, fearing that it would prevent them from expanding the settlement.\n\nIn 2011 UNESCO awarded Battir a $15,000 prize for \"Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes\" due to its care for its ancient terraces and irrigation system.\n\nIn May 2012, the Palestinian National Authority sent a delegation to UNESCO headquarters in Paris to discuss the possibility of adding Battir to its World Heritage List. The PNA's deputy minister of tourism, Hamadan Taha, said that the organization wants to \"maintain it as a Palestinian and humanitarian heritage,\" making special note of its historic terraces and irrigation systems. the nomination of Battir was blocked at the last minute because the formal submission was too late. In a document concerning the damage the separation barrier would do to the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) noted \"The struggle of our neighbors to name the area a World Heritage Site places us in an embarrassing position, and we should work together with them to protect the landscape.\"\n\nIn January 2015, according to the village mayor Akram Badir, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the IDF request to build the separation barrier through the village \n\nAn old Roman bath fed by a spring is located in the middle of the village. Archaeologist D. Ussishkin dates the village to the Iron Age, and states that at the time of the Revolt it was a village of between one and two thousand people chosen by Bar Kochba for its spring, defensible hilltop location, and proximity to the main Jerusalem-Gaza road. A Roman inscription was also discovered near one of the city's natural springs on which are inscribed the names of the Fifth Macedonian Legion and the Eleventh Claudian Legion, which said legions presumably took part in the siege of the city during Emperor Hadrian's reign.\n\nThere isn't any evidence of habitation in the period immediately after the Revolt.\n\n\n"}

It is the third game in the handheld version of the \"Mega Man\" series. The game follows the title character Mega Man as he fights the evil Dr. Wily, whose latest attempt to conquer the world involves sucking energy from the Earth's core to power a new machine. Along with foes from his past, Mega Man must contend with the next robot in Wily's line of \"Mega Man Killers\", Punk. Like its two consecutive predecessors on the Game Boy, the game combines elements from two previously released Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles: \"Mega Man 3\" and \"Mega Man 4\". In 2013, \"Mega Man III\" was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.\n\nThe story of \"Mega Man III\" consists of the hero Mega Man battling the evil scientist Dr. Wily, who is using a converted oil platform in the middle of the ocean to draw energy from the Earth's core to power a new machine. After annihilating eight robots whom Wily had previously used, Mega Man makes his way to Wily's lab, where he encounters the mad doctor attempting to escape. A powerful robot designed specifically to destroy the hero, Punk, confronts Mega Man but is defeated. Mega Man chases Wily onto the oil platform (which emerges from the water as Wily's latest fortress) and halts his enemy's plans once again.\n\n\"Mega Man III\" shares the action and platform gameplay set forth the NES \"Mega Man\" games. The player is able to choose between 4 stages that are immediately available. Mega Man's primary method of attack is his \"Mega Buster\", which can fire an unlimited number of small shots or can be charged by holding the down the button and then releasing a larger and more powerful blast. Beating the Robot Master boss at the end of each stage allows the player to add its unique weapon to Mega Man's arsenal.\n\nThe player can also gain access to Mega Man's dog Rush, who can transform into a \"Coil\" mode to let the player jump higher or a \"Jet\" mode for flying large distances across the screen. Another companion robot, Flip Top Eddie, will appear in certain stages to randomly lend the player health, weapon power, extra lives, or storable Energy Tanks for completely refilling health. \"Mega Man III\" features four Robot Master adversaries from \"Mega Man 3\" (Snake Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, and Gemini Man) and four from \"Mega Man 4\" (Dive Man, Drill Man, Skull Man, and Dust Man).\nSeries contributor Keiji Inafune stated Capcom outsourced the development of \"Mega Man III\" (known in Japan as \"Rockman World 3\") and the rest of the Game Boy titles to the same company that worked on \"\" due to a bad experience with the one that worked on \"Mega Man II\". \"I decided to look at \"World 3\" as a fresh new start, and I remember digging into it with renewed zest,\" Inafune claimed. \"Punk, in particular, was a favorite of mine and I used my sway as the producer to have him included in \"Mega Man Battle Network\".\"\n\n\"Mega Man III\" was given a positive review from the North American \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", which noted its use of familiar gameplay and a large amount of visual detail. In contrast, the United Kingdom's \"Nintendo Magazine System\" called it \"a prime example of flogging a dead horse. Not really bad, but made unplayable by the sheer frustration level.\"\n\nThe editors of GameSpot consider \"Mega Man III\" a rare find because it was never re-released in budget form likes the two games before it. \"Mega Man III\" was made available on March 13, 2001 for the Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan alongside the other four Game Boy \"Mega Man\" games. All five games were to receive an enhanced remake compilation on the Game Boy Advance in 2004, but the project was ultimately cancelled. A redesign of Punk was featured in the spin-off game \"Mega Man Battle Network 3\". A stage featuring the boss Punk was part of the downloadable content for \"Mega Man 10\" in 2010. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man III is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console, which came out in October 9, 2013 in Japan, in North America on May 8, 2014, and in the PAL region on August 14, 2014.\n\n"}

The road connects the industrial part of the city (and further on, Sarajevo Airport) to the Old Town's cultural and historic sites. The boulevard itself has many high-rise buildings giving sniper shooters extensive fields of fire.\n\nMountains surrounding the city were also used for sniper positions, providing a safe distance and giving an excellent view on the city and its traffic.

It is the second game in the handheld version of the \"Mega Man\" series after \"\". It is noteworthy for having been developed by a different company than the rest of the \"Mega Man\" titles on the Game Boy.\n\nThe game follows Mega Man as he pursues his arch enemy Dr. Wily, whose most recent ploy for world domination involves the theft of an experimental time machine. Mega Man confronts both Wily and a number of enemies from his past, including new and mysterious robot named Quint. Just like other Game Boy games in the series, \"Mega Man II\" marries the features of two consecutive Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles, in this case, \"Mega Man 2\" and \"Mega Man 3\". In 2013, \"Mega Man II\" was made available on the Virtual Console of Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It was later released in the North American and PAL region eShops the following year.\n\nThe storyline of \"Mega Man II\" involves the hero Mega Man battling his arch nemesis Dr. Wily as the latter once again attempts to take over the world. This time around the evil genius has stolen an experimental \"Time Skimmer\" from the world's Chronos Institute and used it to travel 37.426 years into the future. Meanwhile, Mega Man is sent to investigate an underground passageway containing enemy Robot Masters from his previous adventures. Mega Man destroys them again and makes his way to Wily's fortress, which contains four more Robot Masters from his past. Once they are destroyed, Mega Man advances and comes upon Quint, a future version of himself. Wily had captured Quint in the future, remodeled him, and brought him back to the present. After Mega Man beats him, Quint relinquishes his \"Sakugarne\" jackhammer weapon to the hero. Mega Man follows Wily to a space station and defeats him.\n\nAs with other games in the series, \"Mega Man II\" is a standard side-scrolling platformer that lets the player take control of the hero Mega Man as he traverses stages and defeats various enemies and bosses. The player is able to run, jump, and shoot as in the previous game, but is now able to slide along the ground as well. The outset of the game allows the player to choose among four stages to be completed in any order. Beating the Robot Master boss at the end of the stage allows the player access to its unique weapon for the remainder of the game. These weapons have limited ammunition that can be refilled by picking up items dropped by enemies. Spare energy tanks can be obtained and selected to completely refill the player's health.\n\nDefeating some Robot Masters will grant Mega Man access to three adaptors for his canine companion Rush to be used in different environments. The Rush Coil allows Mega Man a very high jump; the Rush Marine turns the dog into a submarine for easy underwater mobility; and the Rush Jet lets Mega Man cross large distances. Like \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\", \"Mega Man II\" takes many elements from the NES \"Mega Man\" games. The first four stages and their bosses (Wood Man, Air Man, Clash Man, and Metal Man) come from \"Mega Man 2\". After traveling to Wily's fortress, four new stages become available via a teleportation room. The bosses for these stages (Top Man, Hard Man, Magnet Man, and Needle Man) are taken from \"Mega Man 3\".\n\nCapcom outsourced the development of \"Mega Man II\" to a different company than the one that had worked on \"Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge\". Series artist Keiji Inafune admitted that the design quality of \"Mega Man II\" feeling different from the other games was the result of the developer having very little knowledge of the series. For the next game in the Game Boy line, they decided to forgo using the developer for \"Mega Man II\" again.\n\n\"Mega Man II\" has been re-released as part of the Nintendo Player's Choice line of budget titles in North America. The game was made available on the Japanese Nintendo Power cartridge service on March 13, 2001. Capcom announced a compilation release of the five Game Boy \"Mega Man\" games for a release in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance, but it was cancelled. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man II was planned to release on the 3DS Virtual Console, which released in Japan on September 25 2013, in North America on May 8 2014. and in the PAL region on August 7, 2014.\n\nMega Man II Gameboy received average reviews. Jeremy Parrish of 1UP.com opined \"Mega Man II\" as \"Not Worth It!\", summarizing it as \"a random assortment of enemies and stages from \"Mega Man 2\" and \"Mega Man 3\" from NES, downsampled and downscaled for Game Boy\". \n\nThe Mega Man Archie Comics series incorporated elements of the game, though a full adaptation was not produced before the series went on hiatus.

{"id": "2297089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297089", "title": "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir", "text": "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\n\nThe Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947) is a romantic-fantasy film starring Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison. It was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and is based on a 1945 novel written by Josephine Leslie under the pseudonym of R. A. Dick. In 1945, 20th Century Fox bought the film rights to the novel, which had been published only in the United Kingdom at that time. It was shot entirely in California.\n\nIn England in the early 1900s, young widow Lucy Muir moves to the seaside village of Whitecliff despite the disapproval of her mother-in-law Angelica Muir and domineering sister-in-law Eva Muir. She rents a place called Gull Cottage, though it has a reputation as being haunted by the spirit of a seaman who committed suicide there. On the first night after moving in with her young daughter, Anna, and her loyal maid, Martha, Lucy is visited by an apparition of the former owner, a roguish but harmless sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Gregg tells Lucy that his death four years ago was not a suicide but instead the result of accidentally kicking the valve on a gas-fired room heater in his sleep. Gregg explains that he had wanted to turn Gull Cottage into a home for retired seamen and does not appreciate her presence, having personally frightened away previous visitors. He didn't leave a will – including his plans for the house – because he hadn't anticipated dying so soon. However, due to Lucy's headstrong attitude as well as her appreciation of the house, Gregg reluctantly agrees to allow her to live in Gull Cottage and promises to make himself known only to her.\n\nIt is not long before Angelica and Eva arrive with the news that Lucy's investment — her only source of income — has dried up, and they insist that Lucy move back to London with them. However, Gregg convinces Lucy to stay, using his ghostly abilities to drive her in-laws from the house. He suggests that Lucy publish a book, a dictation of his memories from his time at sea, for which she will take credit. During the course of writing the book they fall in love. Both realize it is a hopeless situation, and Gregg tells Lucy she should find a living man to marry. In London, Lucy becomes attracted to Miles Fairley, a suave author who writes children's stories under the pen name \"Uncle Neddy\" and arranges for an interview with his publisher. The Captain's lurid and sensational recollections, entitled \"Blood and Swash\", become a bestseller, providing Lucy with royalties which she uses to buy Gull Cottage. Fairley follows her back to Whitecliff and begins a whirlwind courtship. Captain Gregg, though initially disgusted by their relationship, decides to leave, as he considers himself an obstacle to Lucy's chance at happiness. While Lucy is asleep, Captain Gregg places in her mind the suggestion that she alone wrote the book and that his presence was merely a dream. He then fades away.\n\nFairley sends a note cancelling a planned visit to Gull Cottage, saying he will be in London for a few days. Later, Lucy visits London to sign a contract, obtaining Fairley's London address from the office clerk and paying a surprise visit. Lucy discovers that Fairley is already married with two children, and his wife tells her that Fairley has romanced other women in the past. Heartbroken, Lucy returns to Whitecliff to spend the rest of her life as a recluse, with Martha looking after her.\n\nAnna, now grown, returns with a Royal Navy lieutenant she plans to marry. In the course of a conversation with her mother, Anna reveals that she too had seen Gregg's ghost, whom she regarded as a childhood friend, and knew about her mother's relationship with \"Uncle Neddy\". Lucy reveals that fate has not been kind to Fairley; his wife and children have finally left him, and he has become fat, bald, and a heavy drinker.\n\nMany years later, now ailing and under a doctor's care, Lucy complains to Martha that her arm hurts, and rejects the glass of hot milk Martha has brought for her. After Martha leaves the room, Lucy takes a sip, but the glass falls to the floor as she dies. Captain Gregg's ghost reappears and reaches out to Lucy, whose young spirit takes his hands and leaves her aged body. They gaze lovingly at each other before walking arm in arm out of the house, into an ethereal mist.\n\n\nAlthough Joseph Mankiewicz had an excellent reputation as a screenwriter, Philip Dunne says Mankiewicz's only contribution to this script was writing a couple of \"excellent lines\" for George Sanders' character. Sanders' casting came about when the original actor playing the role, Richard Ney, was fired for being inadequate in the part. The composer of the film's music, Bernard Herrmann, regarded it as his finest score.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reviewer called \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" \"a pleasurable film, despite its failings,\" singling out Edna Best for \"by far the best performannce \"[sic]\"\". In the writer's opinion, Harrison \"has such an ingratiating personality that this compensates in large measure for the lack of characterization in his role\", but Tierney \"is a pretty girl, but has no depth of feeling as an actress.\"\n\n\"Variety\", on the other hand, praised the actors and the film unreservedly: “Gene Tierney gives what undoubtedly is her best performance to date. It’s warmly human... the out-of-this-world romance pulls audience sympathy with an infectious tug that never slackens. In his role as the lusty, seafaring shade, Rex Harrison commands the strongest attention...Philip Dunne’s script lards the R. A. Dick novel with gusty humor and situations that belie the ghostly theme. Dialog makes full use of salty expressions to point up chuckles.”\n\nCharles Lang received a 1947 Academy Award nomination for his Black and White Cinematography on the movie.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" was adapted as an hour-long radio play on the December 1, 1947 broadcast of \"Lux Radio Theater\" with Charles Boyer and Madeleine Carroll, and was also adapted on the August 16, 1951 \"Screen Director's Playhouse\" with Boyer and Jane Wyatt.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, a TV series titled \"The Ghost & Mrs. Muir\", starring Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare, aired on NBC and then ABC. It had the same premise and main characters as the book and film, but it was a situation comedy, downplaying the romantic fantasy elements and focusing on broad humor. The time and setting were changed, with the action taking place in a contemporary American coastal town (though the ghost was portrayed as being from the Victorian era). For the series, Mrs. Muir's first name was changed from Lucy to Carolyn and the children's names were changed from \"Cyril\" and \"Anna\" (in the original novel) to \"Jonathan\" and \"Candace\".\n\nIn April 1994, \"Variety\" continued its reporting on Sean Connery being slated to play the Captain in a new version of the story for 20th Century Fox. The project was still “in the pipeline” in 1997.\n\nOn June 3, 2005, a musical based on the film and the book, written and directed by James J. Mellon, had its world premiere at the NoHo Arts Center in Los Angeles. Variety gave it a mixed review.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in 2013 by 20th Century Fox after being selected in Fox's Voice Your Choice promotion. It was previously released on DVD as part of the 20th Century Fox Studio Classics collection.\n\n\nStreaming audio\n"}

This is a very rare result; only two ties have occurred in the 2,000 Tests played since 1877. The first was in 1960 and the second in 1986. On both occasions, the aggregate scores of both sides (teams) were equal at the conclusion of play and the side batting last had completed its final innings: 10 batsmen had been dismissed or, from the perspective of the side bowling, 10 wickets had been taken. In other words after four completed innings, with each innings ending either by a declaration or 10 wickets having fallen, the runs for both teams were exactly the same.\n\nIn cricket, a tie is distinct from a draw, a much more common result in Tests, which occurs when play concludes without victory by either team (except where a Test has been formally abandoned).\n\nBoth tied Tests involved the Australian cricket team. Both ended in the last possible over of play on the last day with a ball to spare, meaning that within the space of several minutes all four normal Test match results were possible: a win for the batting side, a win for the fielding side, a draw or a tie. Bob Simpson is the only person to be involved in both tied tests — as a player for Australia in the first, and as the Australian team coach in the second.\n\nThe first tied Test was played between the West Indies and Australia. The match was played at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, known as \"the Gabba\", in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, between 9 and 14 December 1960.\n\nAfter a disastrous start of 65–3, Garfield Sobers made a rapid 132 in 174 minutes. Alan Davidson took 5–135. West Indies were all out for 453 runs.\n\nNorm O'Neill made 181 in 401 minutes. Australia were all out for 505, a lead of 52.\n\nAlan Davidson took 6–87 and West Indies made 284, setting Australia a target of 233 runs to win.\n\nDavidson and Australian captain Richie Benaud set an Australian 7th-wicket partnership record of 134 in matches against the West Indies.\n\nWes Hall was bowling, with the clock showing 5:56. Australia stood at 227–7, needing six runs to win from the 8-ball over (the standard for tests in Australia at the time) with three wickets in hand.\n\n\nAustralia were all out for 232 and the match ended in the first tie in 84 years of Test cricket.\n\nThe second tied test was the first Test of a three Test series, played between Australia and India, at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Madras, in India between 18 and 22 September 1986. The conditions were said to be extremely hot and humid.\n\nAustralia declared at 574 for 7 early on the third day. Dean Jones made 210, which was then the highest score by an Australian side in a Test in India, having faced 330 balls and hit 27 fours and 2 sixes. He had to be treated in hospital after the completion of the innings for heat exhaustion. Australian coach Bob Simpson described it as \"the greatest innings ever played for Australia\". David Boon scored 122, and Australian captain, Allan Border, 106.\n\nIndia lost 7 wickets for 270 runs by the end of the third day, and were all out for 397, avoiding the follow on by only 23 runs and trailing by 177. Indian captain Kapil Dev made 119 and Greg Matthews took 5–103 wearing a sweater to prove his toughness. Sunil Gavaskar became the first Test cricketer to make 100 consecutive Test appearances.\n\nAustralia declared at 170 for 5, their overnight score at the end of the fourth day, setting India a target of 348 to win.\n\nStarting positively, India reached 204 for 2, when Gavaskar was third out for 90. India reached 291 for 5 when Chandrakant Pandit was out. A flurry of tail-end wickets fell to leave India on 344 for 9 by the last over.\n\nGreg Matthews was bowling to Ravi Shastri, with India's last man Maninder Singh at the bowler's end. India needed four runs to win from the 6-ball over with only one wicket remaining.\n\n\nIndia were all out for 347, Matthews having taken 5–146 (10–249 in the match) and Ray Bright 5–94, and the match was the second tie in Test cricket. Dean Jones and Kapil Dev were joint Men of the Match.\n\nIn addition to the two tied Tests, there have been two Tests which ended when time expired with the scores level in the fourth innings, but with the batting side still having wickets in hand. These matches are considered to be draws, rather than ties.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the first game in the handheld series of the \"Mega Man\" franchise. It was released in Japan on July 26, 1991, and was localized in North America that December and in Europe the following year. The game continues the adventures of the android hero Mega Man as he once again confronts the evil Dr. Wily, who has dispatched his revived \"Robot Masters\" and a new \"Mega Man Killer\" named Enker.\n\n\"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" is an action and platform game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) \"Mega Man\" games. The player is tasked with completing a series of four stages in any order desired. Beating a stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be selected at will and used throughout the rest of the game. \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" specifically takes components of the original \"Mega Man\" and \"Mega Man 2\", including their enemies, stage aesthetics, and Robot Masters.\n\nAccording to series artist Keiji Inafune, \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" was the first \"Mega Man\" game to be outsourced to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.\n\nSet in the 21st century (\"200X\"), \"Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge\" follows the storyline of the original \"Mega Man\" series. The titular protagonist Mega Man, a super robot created by the benevolent Dr. Light, has restored peace to the world by halting the plans of the evil Dr. Wily and his powerful \"Robot Masters\". In \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\", the mad scientist returns to send eight of his old robot masters to contend with the hero once again. After vanquishing four of the robot masters, Mega Man heads to Wily's Fortress and deals with the remaining half of them. The protagonist then battles a new robot designed solely for destroying him, the \"Mega Man Killer\" Enker. As Mega Man defeats Enker and obtains his mirror buster ability, Wily retreats to a space station. Mega Man gives chase and, using the mirror buster, destroys Wily's newly built, final weapon. After putting a stop to his nemesis once again, Mega Man travels back home via space shuttle.\n\n\"Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge\" is an action-platformer that shares many similarities with its NES counterparts. The player, as Mega Man, is able to choose among four stages to complete in whatever order desired. Each stage contains various enemies to blast through and obstacles to overcome, such as leaping between disappearing blocks over deadly spikes and bottomless pits. Mega Man's primary weapon is an arm cannon that has unlimited ammunition. Destroyed enemies typically leave items that replenish Mega Man's health or extra lives. At the end of every stage is a boss battle with a robot master, and defeating it earns the player its special weapon. Each boss is weak to another's weapon, allowing the player to strategize the order in which they are beaten.\n\n\"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters from the first two NES games in the \"Mega Man\" series. The initial four stages and bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the original \"Mega Man\". A password system allows the player to return to the game after any or all of these first four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these stages and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from \"Mega Man 2\" for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.\nAccording to series artist and producer Keiji Inafune, \"Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge\" was the first \"Mega Man\" game to be outsourced by Capcom for its development. He felt the game turned out well because the project's leader was a \"huge \"Mega Man\" fan\" who appeared to understand the games better than some of Capcom's own people. Because he thought much of his artwork from the original \"Mega Man\" was not aging well, Inafune redrew many of his old illustrations to be used for the game's enemy character sprites. Beginning with \"Mega Man 2\" for the NES, Capcom began accepting boss ideas from fans. It was not until \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" that Inafune was able to design a boss character from scratch. To keep with the musical motif of naming characters, the new character Enker was named after the Japanese genre enka.\n\nThe decision to release a Game Boy incarnation of the \"Mega Man\" series came after the release of \"Mega Man 3\" on the NES. Early reports of \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" were made in February 1991 in both the magazine \"GamePro\" and Steven A. Schwartz's book \"The Official Guide to Mega Man\". The North American version of this game and the first DOS \"Mega Man\" game share a similar cover art. Instead of being an all new illustration, the \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" North American artwork is a simple touch-up of \"Mega Man 3\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s regional cover, with the surrounding landscape and robot masters cropped out of the picture.\n\nGeneral critical reception for \"Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge\" has been above average, a popular opinion being that the game retains the respectable run-and-gun gameplay of the earliest NES entries in the series. \"What makes this game especially attractive to adults,\" proclaimed \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Bob Strauss, \"is that you can begin your quest on any one of four stages, thus avoiding that linear, start-over-again-from-scratch quality that only 12-year-olds find hypnotic.\" The use of old stages and bosses has not been universally positive. \"GamePro\" was disappointed by the game's lack of originality but preferred its use of recycled content to poorly made new content. In a 2007 retrospective of the \"Mega Man\" franchise, 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish found the use of rehashed details acceptable for its original release, but believed that \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" \"hasn't really held up\". \n\nReviewers have also commented on the game's high difficulty level. Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack stated that certain parts of the game simply require one to have played before in order to succeed. Allgame contributor Colin Williamson noted the game as extremely hard due to its \"pixel-perfect jumps\", the \"sheer number of attackers and flying bullets\", and a lack of checkpoints within each stage. IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas pointed out that the large size of the player character within the small Game Boy screen makes dodging enemy attacks overly challenging and sometimes impossible. He furthermore observed the difficulty to be compounded by a lack of helpful Energy Tanks introduced in the NES \"Mega Man\" sequels.\n\nThe readers of \"GamePro\" voted \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" the best handheld game of 1991. \"Nintendo Power\" readers voted it the fifth-best Game Boy game of that year. In North America, \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" was released under Nintendo's Player's Choice best-seller label in 1996. The game was followed by four sequels on the Game Boy, of which the first three similarly recycle content from the NES games. In Japan, the game was made available on the Nintendo Power cartridge service on March 13, 2001. Capcom had planned to release a full-color compilation of all five Game Boy games on the Game Boy Advance in 2004, but the project was cancelled. In 2011, \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\" was released as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. The game made its way to PAL region and North American eShops later that year.\n\nThe character Enker, who debuted in \"Dr. Wily's Revenge\", appeared as a boss in the Game Boy game \"Mega Man V\" and as a playable character in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game \"Mega Man Soccer\". A downloadable stage in \"Mega Man 10\" features Enker as its boss and his Mirror Buster weapon as the reward for beating him.\n\n"}
{"id": "2297111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297111", "title": "Belpaire firebox", "text": "Belpaire firebox\n\nThe Belpaire firebox is a type of firebox used on steam locomotives. It was invented by Alfred Belpaire of Belgium in 1864. Today it generally refers to the shape of the outer shell of the firebox which is approximately flat at the top and square in cross-section, indicated by the longitudinal ridges on the top sides. However, it is the similar square cross-section inner firebox which provides the main advantages of this design i.e. it has a greater surface area at the top of the firebox where the heat is greatest, improving heat transfer and steam production, compared with a round-top shape.\n\nThe flat firebox top would make supporting it against pressure more difficult (e.g. by means of girders, or stays) compared to a round-top. However, the use of a similarly shaped square outer boiler shell allows simpler perpendicular stays to be used between the shells. The Belpaire outer firebox is, nevertheless, more complicated and expensive to manufacture than a round-top version.\n\nDue to the increased expense involved in manufacturing this boiler shell, just two major US railroads adopted the Belpaire firebox, the Pennsylvania and the Great Northern. In Britain most locomotives employed the design after the 1920s, except notably those of the LNER.\n\nIn steam boilers, the firebox is encased in a water jacket on five sides, (front, back, left, right and top) to ensure maximum heat transfer to the water. Stays are used to support the surfaces against the high pressure between the outside wall and the interior firebox wall, and partially to conduct heat into the boiler interior.\n\nIn many boiler designs, the top of the boiler is cylindrical above the firebox, matching the contour of the rest of the boiler and naturally resisting boiler pressure more easily. In the Belpaire design, the outer upper boiler wall sheets are roughly parallel with the flat upper firebox sheets giving it a squarer shape.\nThe advantage was a greater surface area for evaporation, and less susceptibility to priming (foaming), involving water getting into the cylinders, compared with the narrowing upper space of a classic cylindrical boiler. This allowed G.J. Churchward, the chief mechanical engineer of the Great Western Railway, to dispense with a steam dome to collect steam. Churchward also improved the Belpaire design, maximising the flow of water in a given size of boiler by tapering the firebox and boiler barrel outwards to the area of highest steam production at the front of the firebox.\n\nThe shape of the Belpaire firebox also allows easier placement of the boiler stays, because they are at right angles to the sheets.\n\nDespite these claimed advantages, other locomotive boilers such as the LNER pacifics had flat-topped inner fireboxes with round-topped outer shells and with as good a thermal performance as the Belpaire type, without suffering major problems with staying between shells.\n\nIn the USA, the Belpaire firebox was introduced in about 1882 or 83 by R. P. C. Sanderson, who at the time was working for the Shenandoah Valley Railway (essentially a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, since they shared the same financial backing from E. W. Clark & Co.). Sanderson was an Englishman (later naturalized as an American citizen) who had attained his engineering degree from Cassel in Germany in 1875.\n\nHaving obtained knowledge of a special form of locomotive boiler (the Belpaire), Sanderson wrote to an old acquaintance from his college days who was working at the Henschel locomotive factory at Cassel. He sent Sanderson a tracing of Henschel's latest Belpaire boiler. When shown the design, Charles Blackwell, Superintendent of Motive Power for the Shenandoah Valley Railway, was very pleased with the design and placed an order with the Baldwin and Grant locomotive works for two passenger engines, afterwards numbered 94 and 95, and five freight engines, afterwards numbered, 56, 57, 58, 59, and 60. That marked the beginning of the use of the Belpaire-type locomotive boiler in the United States. The Pennsylvania Railroad used Belpaire fireboxes on nearly all of its steam locomotives. The distinctive square shape of the boiler cladding at the firebox end of locomotives practically became a \"Pennsy\" trademark, as only the Great Northern used Belpaire fireboxes in significant numbers in the USA.\n\n"}

KLMO-FM had signed on in September 1964, the FM counterpart of AM 1060 KLMO (now KRCN). \n\nWestern Cities would move the transmitter site closer to Denver, increase power from 28,000 watts to 100,000 watts, and antenna height was would be increased from 88 feet to 980 feet. The call sign was switched to KQKS, and the format flipped to Adult Contemporary. At the time, the station broadcast at 104.3 FM and was known as \"104.3 Kiss FM.\"\n\nIn mid-1987, the branding was shortened to \"KS104\". On August 1, 1987, amidst heavy competition against three other FM adult contemporary stations in Denver, and with only one Top 40 station in the market, KQKS segued to a Mainstream Top 40 format, again as \"KS104.\" By 1989, KQKS evolved into a Dance-leaning Rhythmic Top 40 outlet. But by 1993, the station shifted back to mainstream contemporary hits when it was left as the market's sole surviving Top 40 radio station. The air staff at the time included Mark Speers and Laurie Michaels in mornings, PJ Cruise in middays, Michael Hayes in afternoons, Sweet G in evenings, Ed Atkins in late evenings, JJ Cruze on overnights, and Brody Scott on swing.\n\nBy 1995, KS104 was competing heavily against KWMX and KALC, particularly for the young female audience. As a direct result, KQKS returned to a rhythmic contemporary direction that year. But by 1996, KQKS was struck by a major blow when the entire on-air staff defected across the street to the newly minted Rhythmic Contemporary rival KJMN, and began attacking \"KS104\" on-air and on the streets.\n\nIn November 1996, Western Cities sold \"KS104\" to Jefferson-Pilot Communications (now known as Lincoln National Corporation) for $15 million. Jefferson-Pilot had no disc jockeys on the air for two months. Jefferson-Pilot was also the owner of 107.5 KHHT at the time. On January 8, 1997, Jefferson-Pilot moved KQKS to 107.5 and relaunched it as \"KS1075\", replacing KHHT. KQKS's former home at 104.3 FM switched to Classic Country on January 18. (104.3 is now sports radio KKFN-FM.)\n\nThe move boosted KQKS's ratings, resulting in KJMN throwing in the towel on March 30, 1997. Since then, KQKS has faced several competitors, but none of them has overtaken KQKS, which maintains a top 5 status in the Denver Nielsen ratings. In 2009, Clear Channel Communications flipped KPTT (which had once competed against KQKS as Top 40/CHR KFMD from 2000 to 2005) to Rhythmic Top 40, resulting in KQKS adding more rap to its playlist. While Rap and Hip-hop accounts for over 50% of KS1075's playlist, the station, like most of the other Rhythmic outlets in the United States, has added some Rhythmic Pop/Dance tracks due to changing tastes among its listeners. As of 2020, KQKS continues to compete against KPTT, which has shifted back to mainstream Top 40/CHR, as well as increased competition from rimshot KFCO, which shifted to a current-focused Rhythmic presentation after nearly 4 years of having a classic hip-hop format, only to return to Top 40/CHR in May 2020, leaving KQKS as the market’s only Rhythmic Top 40.\n\nIn late 2005, Lincoln Financial Group acquired Jefferson-Pilot, which in turn resulted in Lincoln Financial becoming KQKS' parent company. The firm decided to keep Jefferson-Pilot's broadcasting properties in its portfolio despite offers by other broadcasting groups to buy the stations. On April 3, 2006, KQKS and the other stations began replacing the ownership on-air liners \"A Jefferson-Pilot Station\" with \"A Lincoln Financial Station.\" In June 2007, Lincoln Financial announced that would put its television and radio stations up for sale. KQKS and its sister stations in Denver were among the properties being shopped around by Lincoln Financial, until the company suspended those plans in 2008.\n\nOn December 8, 2014, Entercom announced it would purchase Lincoln Financial Group's entire 15-station lineup in a $106.5 million deal, and would operate the outlets under a local marketing agreement (LMA). On December 22, 2014, Entercom announced that it would retain KQKS and its current format. The FCC approved the deal on June 26, 2015.\n\nOn July 9, 1966, KLAK-FM signed on, originally broadcasting at 107.7. It was owned by Lakewood Broadcasting Service and it simulcast the Country format of its sister station AM 1600. In 1970, it relocated to 107.5 and became KJAE, switching its format to Top 40. But this first attempt at contemporary hits would be short lived. The station returned to Country in 1973 and restored the KLAK-FM call sign. In 1978, it changed call letters to KPPL (\"K-People\"), airing a Beautiful Music/MOR format, followed by a brief stint with a Modern Rock format in 1983.\n\nIn February 1983, KPPL and AM sister station KLAK were acquired by Malrite Communications, and would become a sister station to CHR powerhouse WHTZ (Z100) in New York, which went on the air the same year. In July 1984, 107.5 switched to Top 40/CHR and took the call sign KRXY, adopting the moniker \"Y108 FM\". It was the top rated CHR station in Denver during the mid and late 1980s, competing against KOAQ (Q103) until that station transitioned to an adult contemporary format in 1986, and against KPKE until that station flipped in 1987. KRXY also simulcast at night on 1600 AM as \"KRXY-AM\" during this time. Program directors were Robin Mitchell, Scott Fischer (interim), John Driscoll, Mark Bolke, and Dom Testa who took over PD duties in 1991. The music directors were Geina Horton, Todd Cavanah, and Dom Testa. The Y108 morning show was hosted by, in sequence, Chuck Buell, John Driscoll, and Dave Otto. Afternoon personalities included Beau Matthews, Scott \"Scruff\" Thrower, and Dom Testa. Evenings featured Bwana Johnny and Michael \"Moondoggie\" Moon. Don MacLeod was heard on late nights and weekends.\n\nIn October 1987, Malrite Communications sold KRXY to Capitol Cities/ABC Radio for a reported $10.7 million.\n\nKRXY was overtaken in the ratings by KQKS (then at 104.3) in 1991; by this time, KRXY began to lean toward Adult Top 40, and eventually dropped the \"Y-108 FM\" moniker, becoming \"Mix 107.5\" with a Hot AC format in June 1991. After Jefferson-Pilot bought the station from ABC in January 1993, its call letters were changed to KWMX on January 20th. KWMX faced competition from KOSI and KALC in the mid-1990s. In response, KWMX adjusted its playlist to a Modern Pop/Rock direction that KALC was also embracing at the time. In early 1996, the moniker changed slightly to \"107-5 The Mix.\" The move proved unsuccessful for KWMX. In July 1996, KWMX's morning show was let go. \n\nAt midnight on August 2nd, the station began stunting with audio from movies as \"America's Radio Movie Channel.\" At 5 p.m. on the 2nd, KWMX officially flipped back to Top 40, changing its moniker to \"K-Hits 107.5.\" On August 30, 1996, the call letters switched to KHHT to match the \"K-Hits 107.5\" moniker. However, the new format failed to catch on. On January 8, 1997, after Jefferson-Pilot bought KQKS, the \"K-Hits\" format was discontinued with KQKS moving its call letters and rhythmic format to 107.5. The call letter change to KQKS officially took place February 21, 1997.\n\nThe current airstaff includes: Mornings: Tony V, Middays: Rosa, Afternoons: Tashamokia, Nights: Tino Cochino, Weekends: KayLynn Marie and mixers DJ Nunez, DJ Five 8, DJ Squizzy Taylor, DJ Young Smitchell, DJ Hollywood Cook and DJ Staxx. For 15 years, Larry Ulibarri, Kendall B, and Kathie J held down the morning time slot, the longest in the station's history, from 2001 until March 2017 when a contract dispute resulted in their departure from KQKS. Kendall B had already left the station in January 2017 to pursue other opportunities.\n\nKQKS played a pivotal role in breaking the record \"That's What Love Can Do\" by the American female group Boy Krazy. The song, produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, was a commercial failure upon its original release in Europe in 1991. But by late 1992, it began receiving airplay on KQKS after one of the staffers heard a remix done by Hot Tracks, breathing new life into it. The record climbed up the charts, becoming a Top 20 hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, Top 40 Mainstream and Rhythmic Contemporary charts in 1993. Boy Krazy mentions KQKS in their thank you credits on the single which can be found on their first (and only) 1993 self-titled album.\n\n"}

{"id": "2297130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297130", "title": "Abdominal examination", "text": "Abdominal examination\n\nAn abdominal examination is a portion of the physical examination which a physician or nurse uses to clinically observe the abdomen of a patient for signs of disease. The physical examination typically occurs after a thorough medical history is taken, that is, after the physician asks the patient the course of their symptoms. The abdominal examination is conventionally split into four different stages: first, inspection of the patient and the visible characteristics of their abdomen. Auscultation (listening) of the abdomen with a stethoscope. Palpation of the patient's abdomen. Finally, percussion (tapping) of the patient's abdomen and abdominal organs. Depending on the need to test for specific diseases such as ascites, special tests may be performed as a part of the physical examination. An abdominal examination may be performed because the physician suspects a disease of the organs inside the abdominal cavity (including the liver, spleen, large or small intestines), or simply as a part of a complete physical examination for other conditions. In a complete physical examination, the abdominal exam classically follows the respiratory examination and cardiovascular examination.\n\nThe information gathered from the physical examination of the abdomen, along with the information from the history, are used by the physician to generate a differential diagnosis and ultimately a treatment plan for the patient.\nThe purpose of the abdominal exam is to get more information that could indicate what is causing the patient's symptoms. The physician gains information by inspecting, auscultating, palpating, and percussing the abdomen. \n\nA suggested position is for the patient to be supine (on their back), with their arms to their sides. The patient should be placed in an environment with good lighting, and should be draped with towels or sheets to preserve privacy and warmth. The patient's hips and knees should be flexed (in a bent position) so that their abdominal muscles remain relaxed during the examination. Asking the patient to indicate areas that may be tender or painful is recommended to avoid exacerbating the pain during inspection and to increase the patient's comfort. \n\nAlthough physicians have had concern that giving patients pain medications during acute abdominal pain may hinder diagnosis and treatment, separate systematic reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Rational Clinical Examination refute this.\n\nAlthough it may not seem very important, the doctor is actually gaining a lot of information when looking at the abdomen during an exam and can pick up important indications that something may be going on below the surface.\n\nFirst, the doctor looks at the surface, outline, and movements of the abdomen, checking to see if there is anything odd or out of the ordinary.\n\nLooking at the skin, the doctor is looking for anything abnormal like scars, stretch marks, lesions, dilated veins, or rashes.\n\nThe doctor then determines the shape of your abdomen, looking for any bumps, abdominal distension, or depressions. The doctor will also check your belly button for abnormalities like a hernia.\n\nFinally, the doctor will look at the movement of the abdomen checking specifically for waves or odd flexing.\n\nAuscultation refers to the use of a stethoscope by the examiner to listen to sounds from the abdomen.\n\nUnlike other physical exams, auscultation is performed prior to percussion or palpation, as both of these could alter the regularity of bowel sounds.\n\nSome controversy exists as to the length of time required to confirm or exclude bowel sounds, with suggested durations up to seven minutes. Bowel obstruction may present with grumbling bowel sounds or high-pitched noises. Healthy persons can have no bowel sounds for several minutes and intestinal contractions can be silent. Hyperactive bowel sounds may be caused by partial or complete bowel obstruction as the intestines initially try to clear the obstruction. Absence of sounds may be caused by peritonitis, paralytic ileus, late-stage bowel obstruction, intestinal ischemia or other causes. Some authors suggest that listening at a single location is enough as sounds can be transmitted throughout the abdomen.\n\nA prospective study published in 2014 where 41 physicians listened to the bowel sounds of 177 volunteers (19 of which had bowel obstructions and 15 with an ileus) found that \"Auscultation of bowel sounds is not a useful clinical practice when differentiating patients with normal versus pathologic bowel sounds. The listener frequently arrives at an incorrect diagnosis. Agreement between raters was also low (54%).\". This article suggests focusing on other indicators (flatus, pain, nausea) instead. There is no research evidence that reliably corroborates the assumed association between bowel sounds and gastro-intestinal motility status.\n\nThe examiner also typically listens to the two renal arteries for abnormal blood flow sounds (bruits) by listening in each upper quadrant, adjacent to and above the umbilicus. Bruits heard in the epigastrium that are confined to systole are considered normal.\n\nThe examiner should first talk to the patient and explain what this part of the examination will involve. He or she will typically palpate all nine areas of the patient's abdomen, and being mindful of areas of discomfort, begin by palpating areas of no pain. This is typically performed twice, first with light pressure and then with deeper pressure to better exam the abdominal organs. \n\nOn light palpation, the examiner tests for any palpable mass, rigidity, or pain on the surface.\n\nOn deep palpation, the examiner is testing for any organomegaly (enlarged organs.) Typically, the clinician is looking for enlargement of the liver and spleen or abnormal masses in the intestines. Sometimes the physician looks for the kidney and uterus as well.\n\nReactions that may indicate pathology include:\n\nPercussion can be performed in all four quadrants of the abdomen and may reveal a painful response by the patient. During the abdominal examination, percussion may allow the estimation of location and quantity of gas, hard or soft masses, and sizes of certain organs, such as the liver and the spleen. Abnormal findings may include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and urinary retention.\n\nOrganomegaly of the liver and the spleen can be appreciated by percussing in a particular manner:\n\nExamination of the spleen may reveal Castell's sign or alternatively Traube's space.\n\nDull sounds on the abdomen could suggest pregnancy, an ovarian tumor, a distended bladder, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Dullness on either side of the abdomen could suggest ascites. Some other areas of the abdomen may sound dull suggesting that there may be some fluid or feces. The dullness of the liver can be appreciated by percussing at the edge of the lower chest right above the costal margins. The resonant sounds of gastric air bubbles can be appreciated at the left side. In rare cases, when organs are reversed as is the case in situs inversus, resonant (hollow) sounds would be expected on the right side and liver dullness on the left. \n\n\nSpecial maneuvers may also be performed, to elicit signs of specific diseases. These include\n\n"}
{"id": "2297133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297133", "title": "Murphy's sign", "text": "Murphy's sign\n\nIn medicine, Murphy sign refers to a maneuver during a physical examination as part of the abdominal examination. It is similar, but not the same as the sonographic Murphy sign. It is useful for differentiating pain in the right upper quadrant. Typically, it is positive in cholecystitis, but negative in choledocholithiasis, pyelonephritis, and ascending cholangitis.\n\nClassically, Murphy's sign is tested for during an abdominal examination in sitting position; it is performed by asking the patient to breathe out and then gently placing the hand below the costal margin on the right side at the mid-clavicular line (the approximate location of the gallbladder). The patient is then instructed to inspire (breathe in). Normally, during inspiration, the abdominal contents are pushed downward as the diaphragm moves down (and lungs expand). If the patient stops breathing in (as the gallbladder is tender and, in moving downward, comes in contact with the examiner's fingers) and winces with a \"catch\" in breath, the test is considered positive. In order for the test to be considered positive, the same maneuver must not elicit pain when performed on the left side.\n\nMurphy's sign has a high sensitivity and negative predictive value, although the specificity is not high. However, in the elderly the sensitivity is markedly lower; a negative Murphy's sign in an elderly person is not useful for ruling out cholecystitis if other tests and the clinical history suggest the diagnosis.\n\nThe sign is named after American physician John Benjamin Murphy (1857–1916), a prominent Chicago surgeon from the 1880s through the early 1900s, who first described the hypersensitivity to deep palpation in the subcostal area when a patient with gallbladder disease takes a deep breath.\n\n"}

The Rolling Stones in Concert\n\nGet Yer Ya-Ya's Out!': The Rolling Stones in Concert is the second live album by the Rolling Stones, released on 4 September 1970 on Decca Records in the UK and on London Records in the US. It was recorded in New York City, New York and Baltimore, Maryland in November 1969, just before the release of \"Let It Bleed\". It is the first live album to reach number 1 in the UK. It was reported to have been issued in response to the well known bootleg \"Live'r Than You'll Ever Be\".\n\nThe Rolling Stones 1969 American Tour's trek during November into December, with Terry Reid, B.B. King (replaced on some dates by Chuck Berry) and Ike and Tina Turner as supporting acts, played to packed houses. The tour was the first for Mick Taylor with the Stones, having replaced Brian Jones shortly before Jones's death in July; this was also the first album where he appeared fully and prominently, having only featured on two songs on \"Let It Bleed\". It was also the last tour to feature just the Stones – the band proper, along with co-founder and pianist Ian Stewart – without additional backing musicians.\n\nThe performances captured for this release were recorded on 27 November 1969 (one show) and 28 November 1969 (two shows) at New York City's Madison Square Garden, except for \"Love in Vain\", recorded in Baltimore, Maryland on 26 November 1969. Overdubbing sessions were undertaken during January 1970 in London's Olympic Studios. The finished product featured an overdubbed lead vocal on six tracks, added back-up vocals on three tracks, and overdubbed guitar on two songs (\"Little Queenie\" and \"Stray Cat Blues\"). However, this album is widely recognized as one of few actual 'live' albums during this era.\n\nThe title \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!\" is taken from a Blind Boy Fuller song, \"Get Your Yas Yas Out\". The lyric in Fuller's song was \"Now you got to leave my house this morning, don't I'll throw your yas yas out o' door\". In the context of Fuller's original song and its use in other blues music, \"yas yas\" appears as a folksy euphemism for \"ass.\" However, Charlie Watts' t-shirt worn on the album's front cover shows a picture of a woman's breasts, suggesting an alternate explanation. Watts said that his wardrobe on the album cover was his usual stage clothing, along with Jagger's striped hat.\n\nSome of the performances, as well as one of the two photography sessions for the album cover featuring Charlie Watts and a donkey, are depicted in the documentary film \"Gimme Shelter\", and shows Watts and Mick Jagger on a section of the M6 motorway adjacent to Bescot Rail Depot in Birmingham, England, posing with a donkey. This is adjacent to where the RAC building now stands. The cover photo, however, was taken in early February 1970 in London, and does not originate from the 1969 session. The photo by David Bailey, featuring Watts with guitars and bass drums hanging from the neck of a donkey, was inspired by a line in Bob Dylan's song \"Visions of Johanna\": \"Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule\" (though, as mentioned, the animal in the photo is a donkey, not a mule). The band would later say \"we originally wanted an elephant but settled for a donkey\". \n\nJagger commissioned the back cover, featuring song titles and credits with photographs of the group in performance, from British artist Steve Thomas, who has said he produced the design in 48 hours and that Jagger's response was \"I really dig your artwork, man\".\n\nIn the \"Rolling Stone\" review of the album, critic Lester Bangs said, \"I have no doubt that it's the best rock concert ever put on record.\"\n\n\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!': The Rolling Stones in Concert\" was released in September 1970, well into the sessions for their next studio album, \"Sticky Fingers\", and was well-received critically and commercially, reaching number 1 in the UK and number 6 in the US, where it went platinum. Except for compilations, it was the last Rolling Stones album released through Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the US before launching their own Rolling Stones Records label.\n\nIn August 2002, \"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!' The Rolling Stones in Concert\" was reissued in a new remastered album and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.\n\nIn November 2009, the album was reissued with unreleased songs by the Rolling Stones but also by opening acts B.B King and Ike & Tina Turner. It includes a DVD and a 56-page booklet.\n\nThe songs on the second disc of this edition [\"Prodigal Son\", \"You Gotta Move\", \"Under My Thumb\", \"I'm Free\", and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"] are downloadable tracks for the video games \"Guitar Hero 5\" and \"Band Hero\". Additionally, \"Under My Thumb\" is included on the Nintendo DS version of the game \"Band Hero\".\n\nThe album has received consistent praise from critics as one of the greatest live albums ever made. In 2000 it was voted number 816 in Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". In 2007, \"NME\" ranked the album as the 7th greatest live album of all time. \"Q\" ranked the album as the 14th greatest live album of all time.\n\n\nAudio\n\nVideo\n\n\nAdditional personel\n\nProduction\n"}

She was Senior Fellow of the Yale Corporation until she retired from the board in 2016, Senior Counsel at Choate Hall & Stewart, and a member of the Council of the American Law Institute. Marshall was elected in 2017 to the American Philosophical Society.\n\nMarshall was born in Newcastle, South Africa, where she led a student organization for three years called the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS), which was dedicated to ending oppressive minority rule and achieving equality for all South Africans. According to Marshall, \"There was no access to justice in South Africa...There were a few courageous barristers who agreed to represent people charged with political crimes, but, by and large, if you were a black South African, you had no justice. The death penalty was imposed in vastly disproportionate numbers. Many of the offenses were applicable to black South Africans only.\". In June 1966, as NUSAS's vice president, she welcomed U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy to South Africa, in place of Union President Ian Robertson, who had been banned from political appearances. Marshall emigrated to the United States to escape political persecution. In Johannesburg she attended Kingsmead College, and in Delaware she graduated from the Tatnall School. She earned a master's degree in education from Harvard in 1969, and a J.D. degree from Yale in 1976. She acquired United States citizenship in 1978.\n\nIn 1984, she married then-\"New York Times\" columnist Anthony Lewis, to whom she remained married until his death in 2013.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1989, she was an associate and a partner in private practice at the Boston law firm of Csaplar & Bok. From 1989 to 1992, she was a partner in the Boston law firm of Choate, Hall & Stewart. Also from 1991 to 1992, she was president of the Boston Bar Association, the oldest bar association in the United States. From 1992-1996, she was general counsel to Harvard University.\n\nMarshall was appointed to be an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in 1996 by Republican Governor William F.

She is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court, the oldest appellate court in the Western Hemisphere, and the first to serve as chief justice in its more than 300-year history.\n\nIn the course of her term, she wrote more than 200 opinions. Marshall wrote the decision in \"Goodridge v. Department of Public Health\" that declared that the Massachusetts constitution does not permit the state to deny citizens the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nOn July 21, 2010, Marshall announced her decision to retire from the court, effective at the end of October. Marshall said her decision was prompted by a desire to spend more time with her husband Anthony Lewis, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease. After stepping down from the bench, she rejoined Choate, Hall & Stewart.\n\nMarshall served as the senior fellow of the Yale Corporation until 2016, the governing body of Yale University.

It is served by one scheduled airline, subsidized by the federal government's Essential Air Service program at a cost of $2,919,026 (per year).\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service\" airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 11,453 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 10,014 in 2009, and 10,155 in 2010.\n\nDuring World War II the United States Army Air Forces used Garden City Airport as a training airfield by the Army Air Forces Flying Training Command, Gulf Coast Training Center. The facility was called Garden City Army Airfield.\nThe main Garden City Army Airfield and its auxiliaries closed in November 1945 and were declared excess by the military on 18 May 1947. Civil authorities developed the main airfield into Garden City Regional Airport.\n\nContinental DC-3s landed at GCK from about 1946 until replaced by Central in 1961; successor Frontier's Convairs left around 1970.

{"id": "2297151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297151", "title": "San Miguel Eskrima", "text": "San Miguel Eskrima\n\nSan Miguel Eskrima is one of the major systems of eskrima, a martial arts from the Philippines. Founded by Filemon \"Momoy\" Cañete of the Doce Pares Club, SME served as vehicle for his own personal expression of the art and methodology of the club of which he was a co-founder and instructor. The name San Miguel (or \"Saint Michael\") is taken from Michael (archangel), the slayer of Satan, and is one of the major strikes used in Eskrima (From right shoulder to left hip).\n\nSan Miguel Eskrima is blade-based martial art system wherein various weapons are used as a primary training tools to teach universally transferable skills.\n\nThere are two schools of thought on the birth of the San Miguel Eskrima style: The first, sees the San Miguel Eskrima part of an older style called Eskrima of God and Founded by the Ortega Family and more recently by Father Miguel Ortega, Father Jose Ortega and Father Nicolas Ortega in 1930 in Talaga (Argao).\n\n- Father Miguel Ortega, was President of the Church of Talaga City, Co-Founder of the Eskrima style of God and Founder of the style of San Miguel Eskrima called SM Dubli X, style that preferred Long Distance and Medium Distance using passing and rushing shots. Among the few students of Father Miguel Ortega we find Filemon Momoy Canete, who later gives his name to his personal interpretation of San Miguel Eskrima Dubli X, \"San Miguel Eskrima\" in Cebu City.\n\n- Father Nicolas Ortega was responsible for the training of the Filipino rebels during the Japanese invasion, and was awarded a National recognition still present today in front of the church of Talaga with a statue that represents it.\n\n- Father Jose Ortega, co-founder of the Eskima of God, taught the style of the Church to the Seminarists of Talaga.\n\nThe Foundation of the Eskrima of God is linked to a lineage that took place within the Ecclesiastical Order, from Priest to Priest over time and the style began in the late 1800s.\nIn the first school of thought the San Miguel Eskrima founded by the GM Momoy Canete would have only been a small technical part of the style San Miguel Eskrima Dubli X (which in turn was part of the older style called Eskrima of God) or The San Miguel Eskrima X System, to which Momoy gave the name in appreciation and respect towards his Original Master Father Miguel Ortega and in which passing shots were preferred, and double passing strokes, short strokes using the technique of Arco de abaniko and totsada, without an emphasis specific to only one type of weapon, but single stick, double stick, knife, double knife, espada y daga (sword and dagger) (taught to Momoy not by Father Miguel Ortega but by Gm Jesuis Qui to Cebu City), bankaw, saguidas. The steps of the San Miguel Eskrima X System were cross legs and Linambay.\n\nWhile in the second school of thought, in San Miguel Eskrima special emphasis is placed on training with the \"espada y daga\" (sword and dagger) that Momoy has learned from Jesuis Qui. The system encompasses single and double stick, dagger, long blade, bullwhip, staff as well as non-weapon, empty hand areas such as striking, elbows, takedowns, chokes, knees and kicks. Like all eskrima systems, San Miguel Eskrima uses the rattan stick as a primary teaching tool in place of other bladed weapons.\n\nSan Miguel Eskrima is characterized by constant movement, efficiency and simplicity. Proper and precise body mechanics are emphasized, as do proper striking involving speed and power. Although the system trains with both low stances and stand up stances more common in today's Doce Pares as influenced by Momoy's brother Cacoy, the former (low) stances are preferred by SME practitioners for its power and stability. However, both low and high stances are employed when the situation arises. The system encompasses close quarter (corto) fighting with weapons and empty hands, long range (largo mano) and throws/grappling (dumog).\n\nSan Miguel Eskrima training is skill based, as opposed to technique based. Constant drilling, forms and \"repitacions\" are combined with one-on-one touch hands guided sparring with the instructor. It is for this skill based approach that SME needs to be taught in a more intimate setting between instructor and student or a smaller group where touching hands with an instructor is essential. It is through this type of interaction that sensitivity is heightened and the instructor \"guides\" the student. For certain aspects of San Miguel Eskrima such as drills and forms, these aspects of San Miguel Eskrima make it difficult to teach in a large classroom and seminar based environment.\n\nA common source of confusion is that San Miguel Eskrima is separate from Doce Pares; not realizing that San Miguel was a particular expression and methodology of Momoy within the Doce Pares Club and system. Many of the current Doce Pares drills have their roots and terminology in Momoy. Momoy was the Club's founder and its longest instructor until his death in 1995.\n\nBorn Filemon Cañete, on November 22,1904, in the central Philippine island of Cebu, Momoy was the chief instructor of the Doce Pares Club for 55 years until his death in 1995. Together with Lorenzo Saavedra, Teodoro Saavedra, Rostico Cobarrubias and others they formed the Labangon Fencing Club in 1920. In 1932, Momoy joined both Saavedras and his other brothers to form the Doce Pares Club. After that period, Momoy begins to teach outside the Doce Pares Club and more precisely in the San Carlos Seminary, where he teaches a group of seminarians including Jonathan Lao, Nicolas Sellon, Alberto Dacayana Sr and Tarcisio Buno.\n\nMomoy was part of Cebu's famed Cañete clan of eskrimadors (martial artists that practiced eskrima). His brothers included Eulogio (Euling, b. 1919), Tirso, Ciriaco (Cacoy), Rufino and Silvestre.\n\nWith the passing of its founder, Momoy's son Andres \"Kano\" Cañete has become one of the current official recognized bearers of the system. The remaining top students, former well-known fighters of Momoy and now Grandmasters, Benjamin \"Ben\" Culanag, Urbano \"Banoy\" Borja, Federico Mendoza Jnr, Edring Casio, Genaro \"Naro\" Mendoza serve as the \"Advisory Council\" of the system and Dacayana Alberto Sr. He will be the first Student of Momoy to open the Club of San Miguel Eskrima in Mambalin Street along with Idring Casio and Prudencio Ondo Caburnay(Lapunti Arnis). The council oversees all functions of the San Miguel Eskrima organization including curriculum and organizational direction.\n\n\n"}

In 1859 he started a settlement of Irish in southern Missouri, which was wiped out during the American Civil War; this deserted area is now called the Irish Wilderness. The northern Missouri missions suffered greatly during the war, not due to military battles, but by attacks of bushwackers and guerillas.

His father was Johann Christoph Döderlein, professor of theology at Jena. After receiving his preliminary education at Windsheim and Schulpforta (Pforta), he studied at Munich, Heidelberg, Erlangen and Berlin. He devoted his chief attention to philology under the instruction of such men as F. Thiersch, G. F. Creuzer, J. H. Voss, F. A. Wolf, August Boeckh and P. K. Buttmann.\n\nIn 1815, soon after completing his studies at Berlin, he accepted the appointment of ordinary professor of philology in the academy of Bern. In 1819 he was transferred to Erlangen, where he became second professor of philology in the university and rector of the gymnasium. In 1827 he became first professor of philology and rhetoric and director of the philological seminary.\n\nDöderlein's most elaborate work as a philologist was marred by over-subtlety, and lacked method and clearness. He is best known by his \"Lateinische Synonymen und Etymologien\" (1826-1838), and his \"Homerisches Glossarium\" (1850-1858). To the same class belong his \"Lateinische Wortbildung\" (1838), \"Handbuch der lateinischen Synonymik\" (1839), and the \"Handbuch der lateinischen Etymologie\" (1841), besides various works of a more elementary kind intended for the use of schools and gymnasia.

His \"Reden und Aufsätze\" (Erlangen, 1843-1847) and \"Öffentliche Reden\" (1860) consist chiefly of academic addresses dealing with various subjects in pedagogy and philology.\n\n"}

The oxygen source is usually an inorganic superoxide, chlorate, or perchlorate; ozonides are a promising group of oxygen sources. The generators are usually ignited by a firing pin, and the chemical reaction is usually exothermic, making the generator a potential fire hazard. Potassium superoxide was used as an oxygen source on early manned missions of the Soviet space program, for firefighters, and for mine rescue.\n\nCommercial aircraft provide emergency oxygen to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen.\n\nThe oxidizer core is sodium chlorate (NaClO), which is mixed with less than 5\npercent barium peroxide (BaO) and less than 1 percent potassium perchlorate (KClO). The explosives in the percussion cap are a lead styphnate and tetrazene explosive mixture. The chemical reaction is exothermic and the exterior temperature of the canister will reach . It will produce oxygen for 12 to 22 minutes. The two-mask generator is approximately in diameter and long. The three-mask generator is approximately in diameter and long.\n\nAccidental activation of improperly shipped expired generators caused the ValuJet Flight 592 crash, killing all on board. An ATA DC-10, Flight 131, was also destroyed while parked at O'Hare Airport, on August 10, 1986. The cause was the accidental activation of an oxygen canister, contained in the back of a broken DC-10 seat, being shipped in the cargo compartment to a repair station. There were no fatalities or injuries because the plane contained no passengers when the fire broke out.\n\nA \"chlorate candle\", or an \"oxygen candle\", is a cylindrical chemical oxygen generator that contains a mix of sodium chlorate and iron powder, which when ignited smolders at about , producing sodium chloride, iron oxide, and at a fixed rate about 6.5 man-hours of oxygen per kilogram of the mixture. The mixture has an indefinite shelf life if stored properly: candles have been stored for 20 years without decreased oxygen output. Thermal decomposition releases the oxygen. The burning iron supplies the heat. The candle must be wrapped in thermal insulation to maintain the reaction temperature and to protect surrounding equipment. The key reaction is:\n\nPotassium and lithium chlorate, and sodium, potassium and lithium perchlorates can also be used in oxygen candles.\n\nAn explosion caused by one of these candles killed two Royal Navy sailors on , a nuclear-powered submarine, under the Arctic on 21 March 2007. The candle had become contaminated with hydraulic oil, which caused the mixture to explode rather than burn.\n\nIn the Vika oxygen generator used on some spacecraft, lithium perchlorate is the source of oxygen. At 400 °C, it releases 60% of its weight as oxygen:\n\nAdvances in technology have provided industrial oxygen generator systems for use where air is available and a higher concentration of oxygen is desired. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) incorporates a material called molecular sieve for gas separation. In the case of oxygen generation a zeolite-based sieve forces preferential adsorption for nitrogen. Clean, dry air is passed through the sieve beds on the oxygen generator, producing an oxygen-enriched gas. Nitrogen separation membrane equipment is also used.\n\nChemical oxygen generators are used in aircraft, breathing apparatus for firefighters and mine rescue crews, submarines, and everywhere a compact emergency oxygen generator with long shelf life is needed. They usually contain a device for absorption of carbon dioxide, sometimes a filter filled with lithium hydroxide; a kilogram of LiOH absorbs about half a kilogram of CO.\n\n"}

{"id": "2297173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297173", "title": "Master of Philosophy", "text": "Master of Philosophy\n\nThe Master of Philosophy (MPhil; Latin ' or ') is an advanced postgraduate degree. An MPhil typically includes a taught portion and a significant research portion, during which a thesis project is conducted under supervision. An MPhil may be awarded to postgraduate students after completing taught coursework and one to two years of original research, which may also serve as a provisional enrollment for a PhD programme.\n\nIn Australia, the Master of Philosophy is a research degree which mirrors a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in breadth of research and structure. Candidates are assessed on the basis of a thesis. A standard full-time degree often takes two years to complete.\n\nIn Belgium and the Netherlands, the MPhil is a special research degree, and is only awarded by selected departments of a university (mostly in the fields of arts, social sciences, archaeology, philosophy and theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students aiming for an academic career. After finishing these programmes, students normally pursue a PhD programme.\n\nThe Dutch Department of Education, Culture and Science decided in 2009 not to recognize the MPhil degree. Accordingly, Dutch universities stopped awarding this degree and now award the legally-recognized Master of Arts or Master of Science degrees instead.\n\nThe MPhil is offered at some Canadian universities as a two-year degree involving coursework, examinations, and practice at academic writing. At some institutions, successful completion leads to a guaranteed place on a PhD course with \"advanced standing\", reducing the length of the PhD by a year.\n\nIndian universities offer MPhil degrees as the most advanced master's degree in the fields of arts, science and humanities. The duration is typically two years long and includes both a taught portion and an extensive research portion. Several universities offer enrollment in their integrated MPhil–PhD program and MPhil degree holders are usually exempted from some of the doctoral coursework requirement.\n\nIn Finland, the regular master's degree \"filosofian maisteri\" translates to \"Master of Philosophy\". As in English, the term \"philosophy\" does not imply a specialization in theoretical philosophy. These degrees are regular master's degrees, not special \"higher\" degrees (cf. Licentiate and Doctor of Philosophy). In the past, \"filosofian maisteri\" signified that the degree was earned through actual studying, in contrast to honorary master's degrees that were granted upon application to bachelor's degree graduates.\n\nIn Malaysia, the MPhil degree is commonly offered in a number of older and more-established universities in Malaysia, including the University of Malaya, Multimedia University (MMU), Wawasan Open University, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC), Monash University Sunway Campus (MUSC) and Curtin Malaysia Campus. In most cases, the MPhil is largely a research degree, with only a minor taught component. On a case by case basis, candidates must pass a \"viva voce\" examination before the degree is awarded. For UNMC and MUSC, the Faculty of Engineering offers a standalone MPhil degree which will lead to the PhD.\n\nThe MPhil is normally regarded as a more prestigious master's degree than typical taught master's degrees such as the MA, MSc or MEng. Specifically for the University of Malaya, if the desired field of research does not belong to any of the specialized faculties, it is normally categorized under the MPhil supervised by the Postgraduate Institute.\n\nIn November 2012, the Malaysian Qualifications Agency issued programme standards for postgraduate studies in which MPhil is attributed to Master programme by research and mixed mode (coursework and research).\n\nIn Norway, the degree of MPhil was a master's degree (180 ECTS credits) at a level equivalent to an MA or MSc However, unlike a standard MA or MSc, which have a thesis worth 60 ECTS, the MPhil has a research workload of up to 180 ECTS. Upon completion, the MPhil graduate usually qualifies for acceptance to a PhD program. Nevertheless, the MPhil is most often taken as a standalone qualification.\n\nThe MPhil degree was considered to be equivalent to US and UK PhD degrees and from the early 1900s the PhD established itself as the usual translation of Danish and Norwegian master's degrees into English. This must be seen in the context of the fact that the PhD originally designated research education in the US and eventually equivalent degrees in the UK which had a similar scope and fulfilled a similar function as the master's degree in Denmark and Norway, as the final degree taken at the beginning of a research career, while the doctorates in Denmark and Norway were often taken by middle-aged and well-established academics. In Denmark and Norway, PhD in the 20th century was therefore not necessarily or necessarily regarded as identical to a \"doctorate\" as understood in Denmark and Norway. Also in the UK, PhD was explicitly introduced as a \"lower doctorate\" according to US model calculated on younger researchers than those who took the traditional doctorates, and the PhD degree was awarded without defense and with less ceremonial \n\nIn Pakistan, the MPhil is one of the most advanced master's degrees offered by public and private universities in several different fields of study. This is usually a two-year full-time program which includes teaching and research that leads to the PhD. The degree of MPhil also serves as a requirement to gain admission into a Doctoral program in Pakistan.\n\nIn Spain, the MPhil degree is equivalent to the \"Diploma de Estudios Avanzados\", or DEA. In order to obtain it, the student has to complete a full year of doctoral courses and training in research methods, as well as doing original research towards a thesis.\n\nIn most UK universities, the MPhil is a research degree. The completion of an MPhil typically requires two years of full-time (or five years or more of part-time study) and the submission of coursework and a thesis comprising a body of original research undertaken by the candidate (typically 25,000 to 50,000 words). It is common for students admitted into a PhD program at a UK university to be initially registered for the degree of MPhil, and then to transfer (or upgrade) to the PhD upon successful completion of the first (or sometimes the second) year of study: this will often involve the submission of a report or dissertation by the student, and possibly an oral examination or presentation. Conversely, a PhD candidate may transfer to an MPhil programme or be awarded the degree of MPhil if they do not meet the requirements for the award of a PhD.\n\nUsage can be different at the ancient universities. The MPhil at Oxford and Cambridge can be either a taught degree or a research degree, and may take one or two years, depending on the course. Cambridge University offers one- and two-year-long MPhil degree programs across all of its departments and faculties. This takes the place of the MA at other universities, as the Oxbridge MA is awarded to BA graduates after a certain period without any further study. At Oxford University, the MPhil is usually a two-year master's degree, although some programs are one-year. The MPhil requires a lengthy thesis and more examinations than a one-year master's degree (such as the MSc or MSt). The ancient Scottish universities, who for historical reasons award the Scottish MA upon completion of four-year first degree programs in arts and humanities subjects, differ in their use of MPhil or MLitt for postgraduate research degrees, but are slowly standardizing to the MPhil as a research degree and the MLitt as a taught degree.\n\nAlthough most American universities do not award the MPhil, a few award it under certain circumstances. At some of those institutions (including Yale University, Columbia University, George Washington University, The New School and the CUNY Graduate Center), the degree is awarded to PhD candidates when they complete their required coursework and qualifying examinations prior to the completion and defense of a doctoral dissertation. This formalizes the more colloquial \"All But Dissertation\" status; as such, defense of a dissertation proposal is sometimes required for conferral. Other colleges and universities, such as the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania, offer a standalone MPhil as an advanced graduate degree in various fields.\n\n"}

The artwork was designed by Louisville native and art director, William Glenn Hack.\n\nThe flag previously used by the city consists of 13 white stars arranged in a circular pattern in the upper-left corner with three golden fleur-de-lis in the lower-right on a navy blue background. The stars represent the 13 states which existed at Louisville's founding in 1778, while Kentucky was part of Virginia. The fleur-de-lis honor King Louis XVI of France, after whom Louisville was named because France's support during the American Revolution. It was ranked as the ninth best city flag in the United States in a national survey conducted in 2003 and released in 2004. It was replaced by the current design when the city merged with Jefferson County.\n\n"}

He played for Hamburger SV, Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich in his country, having arrived at Munich already aged 34.\n\nDuring his career, Butt scored three times from the penalty spot against Juventus with three clubs. He represented Germany in two World Cups and Euro 2000.\n\nButt was born in Oldenburg and raised in nearby Großenkneten, where his father Jochen ran a company manufacturing loading ramps and industrial doors. As a youngster, he played for the junior teams of his local football club, TSV Großenkneten, as a striker.\n\nButt is married to Katja. As of November 2010, the couple had three children – a daughter and two sons.\n\nButt started his professional career with modest VfB Oldenburg, achieving promotion to the second division in 1996. He moved to Hamburger SV in the 1997 summer and, in his second season, scored seven goals for the team – all from the penalty spot – adding nine in similar fashion the following campaign.\n\nButt joined Bayer 04 Leverkusen on a free transfer in 2001, being the side's undisputed starter in the subsequent campaigns (he only missed one Bundesliga match in his first five seasons combined and added seven goals), and appeared in all the games (17) for a team that lost to Real Madrid in the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League final, scoring a penalty in a 3–1 home win against Juventus F.C. in the second group stage.\n\nIn 2003–04, after scoring a penalty in an away match against FC Schalke 04 on 17 April 2004, Butt turned away from midfield and began to enthusiastically celebrate with his teammates. He did not notice the whistle for the restart of the game and continued to celebrate. Schalke player Mike Hanke took the opportunity to shoot from the halfway line and scored while Butt was still jogging back to his position.\n\nAfter losing Leverkusen's nets to the young René Adler during the 2006–07 season, Butt decided to cancel the contract that linked him to the club until 2009, activating a clause that allowed him to leave the club should he fail to appear in more than half of the games during the second half of the campaign. In July 2007, he signed a two-year deal with Portuguese club S.L. Benfica.\n\nButt made his \"Eagles\" debut in the summer tournament of \"Torneio de Guadiana\", held between Benfica, Sporting Clube de Portugal and Real Betis. In the competition, he saved a penalty against Betis, helping Benfica with the final win. At the Lisbon outfit, however, he played understudy to Portuguese international Quim, being used in the domestic cup matches. He only made one league appearance for Benfica, coming on as a substitute after Quim was sent off against C.S. Marítimo in October 2007 – in this match, he saved a penalty from Ariza Makukula with his first touch of the game, and his team eventually won 2–1.\n\nOn 4 June 2008, Butt signed a two-year contract with reigning champions FC Bayern Munich and was expected to act as backup to Oliver Kahn's heir, highly rated young Michael Rensing. He made his official debut for the club in the Champions League round-of-16 second leg against Sporting Lisbon in a 7–1 home drubbing, on 10 March 2009. With Rensing dropped to the bench following a 5–1 loss at Vfl Wolfsburg, he also started the remaining games of the season, as the initial first-choice was also nursing a hand injury.\n\nAfter the team's poor start to the 2009–10 season with Rensing in goal, Butt was reinstated as the first-choice. On 8 December 2009, he scored his first goal for the club, a crucial penalty in the club's last Champions League group stage match at Juventus, coming from behind to a 4–1 victory – after this feat, he has managed to score a goal against Juventus in the Champions League for all three major German clubs he represented.\n\nOn 30 January 2010, Butt missed out on the opportunity to score his first league goal for Bayern as his penalty was saved by 1. FSV Mainz 05's Heinz Müller, but it proved to be of no detriment to the club as it won 3–0. On 16 February, he was rewarded for an outstanding season with a contract extension until 2011. He was also in goal for the Champions League final, where his team was denied an historic treble after losing 0–2 to F.C. Internazionale Milano.\n\nMidway through the 2010–11 season, 36-year-old Butt lost his starting place to another club youth graduate, Thomas Kraft. However, a series of unconvincing displays by the youngster, including a 2–3 home loss against Inter Milan in the Champions League quarterfinals on 15 March 2011, and a 1–1 away draw with 1. FC Nürnberg on 9 April, paved the way for the veteran to return to the starting line-up, which happened on 17 April, in a 5–1 home victory over former club Bayer Leverkusen, and he still appeared in 30 official games during the campaign (23 in the league), as his team finished in third position.\n\nOn 3 May 2011, Butt signed a one-year extension to his contract with Bayern, backing up newly signed Manuel Neuer. He retired at the end of the season at the age of 38, after a friendly with the Netherlands on 22 May 2012 in which he acted as captain.\n\nButt was Germany's third-choice goalkeeper, behind Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann, at both the UEFA Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup, remaining an unused substitute in both tournaments.\n\nHe won three international caps for Germany in friendly matches, his debut coming against Liechtenstein on 7 June 2000, where he appeared for the second half of an 8–2 routing.\n\nOn 6 May 2010, Butt, Neuer and Tim Wiese were chosen as Germany's goalkeepers for the 2010 World Cup, with the Bayern man taking the place of former Leverkusen teammate Adler, who had to withdraw due to a rib injury. He made his first competitive international appearance on 10 July, appearing in the 3–2 win against Uruguay in the tournament's third-place playoff.\n\nButt was appointed head of the Bayern Munich Junior Team on 1 July 2012. He left the position on 7 August, stating \"I misjudged this field of activity, for which I've had responsibility for a few weeks now. I approached my new appointment with great enthusiasm, but I have realised that the task does not offer the satisfaction and passion I wanted. This is the reason for my decision. I would like to thank FC Bayern for their understanding.\"\n\n\"Statistics accurate as of 28 April 2012\"\n\n\"Source\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2297190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297190", "title": "WPTI", "text": "WPTI\n\nWPTI (94.5 MHz), is a commercial FM talk and sports radio station serving the Piedmont Triad area of North Carolina, covering the Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point media market. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and is licensed to Eden, North Carolina. Its transmitter is located in Madison, North Carolina, and its studios and offices are located on Pai Park near Interstate 40 in Greensboro. WPTI broadcasts with 100,000 watts.\n\nWPTI is one of North Carolina's most powerful stations, providing at least secondary coverage from the southern suburbs of Roanoke to the northern suburbs of Charlotte. Its transmitter is located further north than most of the major Triad stations, allowing much of Southside Virginia (Martinsville, Danville) to get a city-grade signal. \n\nWPTI airs mostly nationally syndicated talk shows by day and sports shows at night. Weekends feature both talk and sports shows, as well as paid brokered programming. National news from Fox News Radio is heard at the beginning of most hours, except when sports shows are airing.\n\nThe station first went on the air on March 20, 1949 as WLOE-FM, simulcast with its AM sister station 1490 WLOE. In the 1970s, the station switched call letters to WEAF as a beautiful music outlet. It later took the call letters WSRQ. In 1984, the station increased power to 100,000 watts, relocated its studios to Greensboro, and switched to country music as WWWI \"I-95,\" competing against the market's entrenched and top-rated country outlet, WTQR. Later the name was changed to \"I-94.5\" to help listeners more easily find the station during the time that digital tuners were replacing traditional analog receivers. In 1986 the call letters were switched to WKLM \"Classy 94.5\" when the station returned to beautiful music. Later the name changed to WWMY \"My 94.5\", though the format remained the same. WWMY switched to MOR in 1990, later changing to the new call letters WMKG and the name \"Magic Lite\" when WMAG began providing the station's programming. In 1992, WMKG became WNEU \"New Country 94.5\", later changing its name to \"Cat Country\".\nOn September 22, 1994, the station became WXRA \"94.5 the Rock Alternative\", playing modern rock. Later in the 90s, the station began playing a mix of old and new rock and called itself \"The Rock Station\". Around New Year's Day, 2001, WXRA's format moved to 100.3 FM, with 94.5 FM becoming WWCC, a classic-leaning country music station. Ratings for this format were poor. On February 24, 2003, WWCC became WGBT, and flipped to a Rhythmic Top 40 format as \"94.5 The Beat.\"\n\nOn February 16, 2006, at 5 p.m., after playing \"Don't Forget About Us\" by Mariah Carey, WGBT switched to a Spanish-language classic hits format as \"La Preciosa.\" The station played Regional Mexican music from the 70s, 80s and 90s. As such, WGBT became The Triad's first FM Spanish-language radio station (and the second in North Carolina). This made the fourth distinctly different radio format in five years to be broadcast on the 94.5 frequency in the Greensboro market.\n\nAt the end of 2009, the Curtis Media Group announced that its WSJS/WSML news talk simulcast would no longer carry The Rush Limbaugh Show. On December 31, 2009, WGBT became a talk station known as \"Rush Radio 94.5\" under new calls WPTI. The station stunted with weekend-long continuous replays of \"The Rush Limbaugh Week in Review\" through New Year's weekend. The Glenn Beck Program and a local show called \"The Morning Rush\" hosted by Bill Flynn and Pamela Furr debuted January 4.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, Sean Hannity moved to WPTI.\n\nIn November 2010, the station canceled \"The Morning Rush\" with Flynn and Pamela Furr (although Furr continued with anchoring news for both WPTI and WRDU). After Christmas of 2010, Dmitri Vassilaros began hosting the morning show. In 2011, WPTI replaced Vassilaros with K.C. O'Dea.\n\nON May 24, 2013 WPTI dropped the \"Rush Radio 94.5\" branding, now just calling itself \"94.5 WPTI\".\n\nWPTI is the Triad's FM affiliate of the Tar Heel Sports Network, which broadcasts football and basketball games involving the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tar Heels. Following derogatory comments made by Rush Limbaugh regarding Sandra Fluke, WPTI was asked not to promote the university or the Tar Heel Sports Network during \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\".\n"}
{"id": "2297198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297198", "title": "Backbeat (film)", "text": "Backbeat (film)\n\nBackbeat is a 1994 Anglo-German independent drama film directed by Iain Softley. It chronicles the early days of the Beatles in Hamburg, Germany. The film focuses primarily on the relationship between Stuart Sutcliffe (Stephen Dorff) and John Lennon (Ian Hart), and also with Sutcliffe's German girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr (Sheryl Lee). It has subsequently been made into a stage production.\n\nThe film follows the Beatles through their pre-fame Hamburg days when Stuart Sutcliffe, the band's bassist, meets German photographer Astrid Kirchherr.\n\nIn addition, brief portrayals of other historical characters in these early days of the Beatles include Paul Duckworth as Ringo Starr, Paul Humpoletz as Bruno Koschmider, Wolf Kahler as Bert Kaempfert and James Doherty as Tony Sheridan.\n\nHart had already played Lennon in the 1991 film \"The Hours and Times\". Bakewell later reprised his role as McCartney in the 2000 television film \"The Linda McCartney Story\". Williams reprised his role as Best in the 2000 television film \"\".\n\nThe original script was written by Iain Softley based on a series of 1988 interviews. After failing to secure funding, screenwriter Stephen Ward was brought in to completely rewrite the script in 1993. Ward interviewed Astrid Kirchherr and others who were close to the Beatles during their time in Hamburg. The project was green-lit that year.\n\nDue to the film's focus on the early days of the band, the soundtrack includes no songs written by members of the Beatles but various songs the group performed in Hamburg, written and recorded by other artists. In this respect, rather than re-create the sounds of the period, iconoclastic, rebellious musicians were recruited (as a producer noted, the Beatles' pre-recording stage act was \"the punk of its day\") to better convey the way the music was appreciated by audiences of the time. All musicians were members of contemporary American rock bands:\n\nThe film's distributor happened to be PolyGram Filmed Entertainment which was then under common ownership with Polydor Records, the label that owned the rights to the Beatles' music from the Hamburg days.\n\nThe film premiered on 14 April 1994. It was then distributed on a limited release. A DVD version was released by Universal Studios in 2005.\n\nAs of July 2019, \"Backbeat\" holds a rating of 69% based on 39 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the review aggregator site. \"Rolling Stone\" liked how the film captured the early 60s period through its visual style and use of music. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars; although he thought the \"dialogue has real wit\" the film was let down because \"it's never able to convince us there's a story there\".\n\nPaul McCartney said of the film:\nOne of my annoyances about the film \"Backbeat\" is that they've actually taken my rock 'n' rollness off me. They give John the song \"Long Tall Sally\" to sing and he never sang it in his life. But now it's set in cement. It's like the Buddy Holly and Glenn Miller stories. \"The Buddy Holly Story\" does not even mention Norman Petty, and \"The Glenn Miller Story\" is a sugarcoated version of his life. Now \"Backbeat\" has done the same thing to the story of the Beatles. I was quite taken, however, with Stephen Dorff's astonishing performance as Stu.\n\nAstrid Kirchherr praised the accuracy and detail of her relationship with Sutcliffe and the Beatles. The film received further positive responses from Julian Lennon, Pete Best, and Sutcliffe's sister, Pauline, who said, \"I still think the director did a fabulous job. It's a good movie. If you like movies, it's a great movie.\"\n\nThe film's original writer and director, Iain Softley, turned the screenplay of \"Backbeat\" into a theatrical production. It premiered at Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre on 9 February 2010 featuring a live band. In 2011 another stage version opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in London.\n\n\n"}

It was the final game of the 1966 NFL season.\n\nIt determined the champion of the National Football League (NFL), which met the champion of the American Football League (AFL) in Super Bowl I, then formally referred to as the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game. The Western Conference champion Green Bay Packers (12–2), defending league champions, were hosted by the Dallas Cowboys (10–3–1), the Eastern Conference champions.\n\nThe home field for the NFL Championship alternated between the two conferences; even-numbered years were hosted by the Eastern and odd-numbered by the Western. Starting with the 1975 season, playoff sites were determined by regular season record, rather than a rotational basis.\n\nThe New Year's college bowl game at the Cotton Bowl for the 1966 season included the SMU Mustangs of Dallas. It was played the day before, New Year's Eve, which required a quick turnaround to transform the natural grass field. The two games were filled to the 75,504 capacity, but both local teams came up short.\n\nIt was the first NFL title game played after the AFL-NFL Merger was announced in June 1966. The game was played on January 1, 1967, the second consecutive year that the NFL season ended in January, rather than December. This was seventh season for the Dallas Cowboys and their first winning record since entering the league in 1960. They were champions of the NFL's Eastern Conference with a 10–3–1 record. The Packers won the Western Conference with a 12–2 record, their eighth consecutive winning season under head coach Vince Lombardi.\n\nTickets for the game sold for ten dollars, and kickoff was just after 3 p.m. CST, televised by CBS, following the AFL Championship from Buffalo on NBC.\n\nThe final score was Green Bay 34, Dallas 27. Two weeks later, Green Bay went on to easily defeat the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I in Los Angeles.\n\nThe seasoned Packers, defending champions of the season, were favored by a touchdown over the talented, but young Cowboys team, who had no players with championship experience and only one player over 30, linebacker Chuck Howley. The game was expected to be a shootout, and as wary as the Packers were of Cowboys wide-out Bob Hayes, the fastest man in football at the time, Lombardi made the decision before the game not to put double-coverage on the Olympic champion sprinter. It proved to be a good gamble, as Herb Adderley and Bob Jeter held Hayes to only one reception for one yard. Lombardi also installed a special offense for the game, knowing that the Cowboys had spent time preparing to stop plays like the Packers sweep.\n\nGreen Bay scored on their opening drive, with Elijah Pitts breaking free for a 32-yard run on the opening play - a misdirection play that was part of Lombardi's special game plan. Later Pitts took a circle route pass over the middle from Bart Starr at the Cowboy 5 and broke a tackle by Warren Livingston to cap a 17-yard touchdown play. Then Cowboys defensive back Mel Renfro fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Packer rookie Jim Grabowski returned it 18 yards to give Green Bay a 14-0 lead before Dallas' first play. But the Cowboys stormed back with a 13-play drive to score on Dan Reeves' 3-yard rushing touchdown. Then after forcing a punt, they drove 59 yards to tie the game at 14 with a 23-yard touchdown burst by fullback Don Perkins.\n\nStarr broke the tie on the third play of the second quarter with a 51-yard bomb to Carroll Dale over the head of CB Cornell Green. Dallas responded with a 68-yard drive to the Packers 4-yard line, featuring a 40-yard completion from Don Meredith to a wide open Reeves, but could go no further and settled for an 11-yard Danny Villanueva field goal, cutting their deficit to 21-17. Green Bay had a chance to retake a 7-point lead before halftime, but Don Chandler's 30-yard field goal attempt was blocked by Cowboys tackle Ralph Neely.\n\nEarly in the third quarter, Dallas defensive back Warren Livingston recovered a fumble from Pitts on the Cowboys 21-yard line. Meredith then led the team on a 13-play drive to bring the score to within one point, 21-20, on Villanueva's 32-yard field goal. But on Green Bay's next drive, Starr completed a 40-yard pass to Dale, who beat Green to the outside. From the Dallas 16 Starr hit Boyd Dowler cutting across the field for his third TD pass of the game, giving the Pack a 28-20 lead going into the fourth quarter. Dallas safety Mike Gaechter upended Dowler after the end took several steps in the end zone, causing Dowler to leave the game (Dowler was hampered much of the season by a calcium deposit on his shoulder). Bart Starr had to guide an upset Jim Taylor to the Green Bay sideline when the fiery Green Bay fullback started looking for Gaechter.\n\nLate in the final period, Hayes fielded a punt on his own 1-yard line and was tackled inside the 5. Don Meredith hit a cold streak and missed several passes, and a Dallas punt gave Green Bay good field position on the Dallas 48. George Andrie sacked Starr on the first play, but he then picked up a key first down with a 24-yard pass to tight end Marv Fleming. Later faced with 3rd and 12, he completed a 16-yard pass to fullback Jim Taylor for a first down. Starr was again sacked on the drive, this time for an 11-yard loss by Willie Townes. But on third and nineteen, the Packers picked up a Cowboy blitz and Starr threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Max McGee (who replaced the injured Dowler). McGee had told Starr he could beat cornerback Warren Livingston to the outside (\"Zig out\" pattern). With just 5:20 left, the game appeared to be slipping out of reach for the Cowboys. However, defensive tackle Bob Lilly kept his team in the game by blocking Chandler's extra point attempt, keeping the deficit at 2 scores, 34-20, rather than 3.\n\nDallas started their comeback attempt on the ensuing drive. Faced with 3rd down and 20, Meredith threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to tight end Frank Clarke, making the score 34-27. Desperately trying to run out the clock with their ensuing possession, Green Bay started out with an 18-yard reception by Fleming on the Packers 46. But on the next play, Starr was sacked for an 8-yard loss by linebacker Dave Edwards. Townes broke up a screen pass on the next play, and then Taylor was stuffed for a loss. Now faced with 4th down, a heavy rush from the Dallas defense caused Chandler's punt to go just 17 yards, giving the Cowboys the ball on the Green Bay 47-yard line with 2:12 remaining.\n\nA 21-yard catch by Clarke and a 4-yard run by Perkins advanced the ball to the Green Bay 22-yard line. Then a pass interference penalty on safety Tom Brown gave the Cowboys a first down at the Packer 2-yard line. Halfback Dan Reeves gained a yard on first down. A crucial mistake on a false start by Jim Boeke penalized the Cowboys back to the Green Bay 6 (nullifying a play where a wide-open Pettis Norman had dropped a pass in the end zone), and Reeves then dropped a pass in the flat on second down. Reeves had been scratched in the eye on his previous run but did not come out of the game despite clouded vision, another mental error. Meredith found tight end Pettis Norman on third down to bring Dallas back to the two-yard line, the end making the catch on his knees. On fourth down, the Cowboys attempted a rollout pass. No one noticed that end Bob Hayes was in the goal line offense instead of Frank Clarke, who was typically used for better blocking. Packer linebacker Dave Robinson recognized the play from films, brushed Hayes aside, stormed into the Cowboy backfield and enveloped Meredith. Somehow Meredith got a wobbly sidearm toss away, but Tom Brown intercepted the pass in the end zone as the intended receiver, Hayes, was surrounded by Packers defenders. Vince Lombardi later congratulated Robinson, but in the next breath criticized him for being out of his assigned position.\n\nStarr completed 19 of 28 passes for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns, with no interceptions, though he was sacked five times. His quarterback rating for the game was a stellar 143.5. Dale caught 5 passes for 128 yards and a score. Pitts led the Packers in rushing with 66 yards and caught a TD pass. Meredith finished the game 15/31 for 238 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, while also rushing for 22 yards. Perkins rushed for 108 yards and a score, while Reeves rushed for 47 yards, caught 4 passes for 77 yards, and scored a touchdown.\n\n\"I don't know, we haven't played Alabama yet.\" – Vince Lombardi after being asked what it felt like to be the greatest football team in the world just after winning the 1966 NFL Championship Game.\n\nWith the win, the Packers earned their tenth NFL championship; it was their second in a row and fourth in six seasons under Lombardi, in his eighth year as Green Bay's head coach.\n\nThis was the Packers' only post-season win in the Dallas area prior to the 2010 season, when they beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, played in the Cowboys' current home, Cowboys Stadium.\n\nSunday, January 1, 1967\"<br>\nKickoff: 3:05 p.m. CST\n\n\n\nThe NFL had six game officials in ; the line judge was added a season earlier in and the side judge arrived twelve years later in .\n\nThe Packer players each received $8,600 and the Cowboy players about $6,000 each, an increase over the previous year's ($7,500 and $4,600).\n\nOver in the AFL, the winning Kansas City Chiefs split their players' shares for the title game 51 ways for $5,308 each, while the Buffalo Bills split theirs into 47 shares for about $3,800 each.\n\nThe upcoming Super Bowl awarded an additional $15,000 per player for the winners and $7,500 each for the losing team.\n\n"}
{"id": "2297208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297208", "title": "Umbri", "text": "Umbri\n\nThe Umbri were Italic people of ancient Italy. A region called Umbria still exists and is now occupied by Italian speakers. It is somewhat smaller than the ancient Umbria.\n\nMost ancient Umbrian cities were settled in the 9th-4th centuries BC on easily defensible hilltops. Umbria was bordered by the Tiber and Nar rivers and included the Apennine slopes on the Adriatic. The ancient Umbrian language is a branch of a group called Oscan-Umbrian, which is related to the Latino-Faliscan languages.\n\nThey are also called \"Ombrii\" in some Roman sources. Some Roman writers thought the Umbri to be of Celtic origin; wrote that they descended from an ancient Gaulish tribe. Plutarch wrote that the name might be a different way of writing the name of the Celto-Germanic tribe , which loosely means \"King of the .\" He also suggested that the , another Gaulish tribe, might be connected; their Celtic name \"Isombres\" could possibly mean \"Lower Umbrians,\" or inhabitants of the country below Umbria. Similarly Roman historian Cato the Elder, in his masterpiece Origines, defines the Gauls \"the progenitors of the Umbri\".\n\nThe Umbri are mentioned, with the Lombards and the Suebi, among the Germanic tribes of Northern Europe in the poem Widsith. Furthermore, according to Roman authors, the Umbri/Ambrones originated somewhere in Germany or Scandinavia. Pliny the Elder wrote concerning the folk-etymology of the name: \n\nDuring the 6th–4th centuries BC, Umbrian communities constructed rural sanctuaries in which they sacrificed to the gods. Bronze votives shaped as animals or deities were also offered. Umbrian deities include Feronia, Valentia, Minerva Matusia and Clitumnus. The Iguvine Tablets were discovered in 1444 at Gubbio, Italy. Composed during the 2nd or 3rd centuries BC, they describe religious rituals involving animal sacrifice.\n\nTwo men held the supreme magistracy of \"uhtur\" and were responsible for supervising rituals. Other civic offices included the \"marone\", which had a lower status than \"uhtur\", and a religious position named \"kvestur\". The Umbrian social structure was divided into distinct groups probably based upon military rank. During the reign of Augustus, four Umbrian aristocrats became senators. Emperor Nerva’s family was from Umbria.\n\nAccording to Guy Jolyon Bradley, \" The religious sites of the region have been thought to reveal a society dominated by agricultural and pastoral concerns, to which town life came late in comparison to Etruria.\"\n\nThroughout the 9th-4th centuries BC, imported goods from Greece and Etruria were common, as well as the production of local pottery.\n\nThe Romans first made contact with Umbria in 310 BC and settled Latin colonies there in 299 BC, 268 BC and 241 BC. They had completed their conquest of Umbria by approximately 260 BC. Incorporation into the Roman state occurred during the 3rd century BC when some Umbri were given full citizenship or citizenship without the right to vote. Also during the 3rd century BC about 40,000 Romans settled in the region. The Via Flaminia linking areas of Umbria was complete by 220 BC. Cities in Umbria also contributed troops to Rome for its many wars. Umbrians fought under Scipio Africanus in 205 BC during the Second Punic War. The Praetorian Guard recruited from Etruria and Umbria. The Umbri played a minor role in the Social War and as a result were granted citizenship in 90 BC. Roman veterans were settled in Umbria during the reign of Augustus.\n\nThe Umbrians descend from the culture of Terni, protohistoric facies of southern Umbria. \nThe towns of Chianciano and Clusium (Umbrian: \"Camars\") near modern Arezzo contain traces of Umbrian habitation dating to the 7th or 8th centuries BC. Terni (in Latin: \"Interamna Nahars\") was the first important Umbrian center. Its population was called with the name of \"Umbri Naharti\". They were the largest, organized and belligerent tribe of the Umbrians and populated compactly across the basin of Nera River. This people are quoted for 7 times in the Iguvine Tablets. This is confirmed not only by the Iguvine Tablets, Latin historians and by the important and privileged role played by this city in Roman times, but also by the discovery, at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, of one of the mixed burial necropolis (Urnfield culture and burial fields) larger of Europe, about 3000 tombs (Necropoli delle Acciaierie di Terni).\n\nAssisi, called \"Asisium\" by the Romans, was an ancient Umbrian site on a spur of Mount Subasio. Myth relates that the city was founded by Dardanus in 847 BC.\n\nPerugia and Orvieto are not considered Umbria but Etruscan. According to the geographical distribution of the Umbrian territory, they are located on the left side of the Tiber River, which is part of the ancient Etruria. Umbri were on the opposite side of the river. According to the map of \"Regio Umbria and Ager Galliucus\" by Emperor Augustus , the major Umbrian city-state were: Terni, Todi, Amelia and Spoleto (the current part of southern Umbria). While north Umbrian cities such as Gubbio or Città di Castello will be affected by the influence of Etruscan culture (a try are the Iguvine Tablets), they will develop a form of writing that is mix of Umbrian and Etruscan language, while the southern Umbrians (the purest and conservative in terms of tradition, language and culture) will not have.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The author of three bestselling books, Perlstein received the 2001 \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize for his first book, \"Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus\". Politico has dubbed him \"a chronicler extraordinaire of modern conservatism.\"\n\nPerlstein was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to a Reform Jewish family, the third child of Jerold and Sandra (née Friedman) Perlstein. His father ran Bonded Messenger Service, a delivery company founded by his grandfather in 1955. Perlstein grew up in the Bayside and Fox Point neighborhoods of suburban Milwaukee, taking cross country trips with his parents and siblings to national landmarks like Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone National Park. In high school, upon earning his driver's license, Perlstein would head to Renaissance Books in downtown Milwaukee, and spend hours in its basement among stacks of old magazines from the 1960s. He later recounted in an interview: \"I ended up getting my own archive on the 1960s culture wars. That's where it started.\" He also wrote in \"Rolling Stone\": \"A sixties obsessive since childhood, I misspent my teenage years prowling a ramshackle five-story used-book warehouse that somehow managed . . . to stay one step ahead of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's building inspectors.\" Following graduation from Nicolet High School, Perlstein attended the University of Chicago, earning a B.A. in History in 1992. While at the University of Chicago – years Perlstein described as \"delightfully noisy and dissident\", and a stark contrast to the suburbia of his youth, which \"felt like a jail\" – he was able to engage with and catch neighborhood jam sessions.\n\nAfter graduate study in American studies at the University of Michigan, Perlstein moved to New York in 1994, settling in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. While in New York, Perlstein interned at Lingua Franca, a magazine about academic and intellectual life, where he would become an associate editor. Perlstein also began writing book reviews, for publications like \"The Nation\" and \"Slate\". It was Perlstein's 1996 \"Lingua Franca\" essay \"Who Owns the Sixties?\" that won him public notice, by exposing the emerging chasm between older and younger historians. The essay also aroused the attention of a literary agent and soon after earned him a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n, Perlstein had published three notable books on the subject of modern American conservatism.\n\nIn 1997, Perlstein began work on a history of the rise of Barry Goldwater, a transformative event for the conservative movement. Perlstein's book, \"Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus\", was released in 2001 to widespread acclaim, including a laudatory \"New York Times\" review by William Kristol, editor of the conservative \"Weekly Standard\". Kristol wrote of \"Before the Storm\", \"It's an amazing story, and Perlstein, a man of the left, does it justice.\" Perlstein won the 2001 \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize in History. Soon after, Perlstein moved from New York to Chicago. From 2003 to 2005, Perlstein was the Village Voice's national political correspondent, and contributed articles to publications that included the \"New York Times\", \"The New Republic\" and \"The American Prospect\".\n\nBeginning in spring 2007 through 2009 Perlstein was a Senior Fellow at the Campaign for America's Future where he wrote for its blog \"The Big Con\" about the failures of conservative governance. A co-director at the Campaign for America's Future once noted, \"Rick was unique. … I don't know when he sleeps.\"\n\nIn May 2008, Perlstein's \"\" was published to rave reviews. In his review, the conservative columnist George Will credited Perlstein having \"a novelist's, or perhaps an anthropologist's, eye for illuminating details\" and called \"Nixonland\" \"compulsively readable.\" At the end of 2008, \"The New York Times\" included Nixonland among its notable books. In 2009, The A.V. Club included it among the best books of the decade.\n\nIn August 2014, Simon & Schuster published \"The Invisible Bridge: the Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan.\" In his New York Times review, Frank Rich wrote that the tome was \"a Rosetta stone for reading America and its politics today.\" \"The Invisible Bridge\" received favorable reviews from \"The New Yorker\", \"Slate\", and \"The Washington Post\" among others.\n\nConservative author and public relations consultant Craig Shirley has alleged that \"The Invisible Bridge\" stole distinctive words and phrasing his 2004 book, \"Reagan's Revolution\". Perlstein's supporters regarded the criticism as a partisan attack. Responding to numerous complaints, \"Times\" public editor Margaret Sullivan dismissed the plagiarism allegations as a \"smear\" and criticized the reporting for \"conferr[ing] a legitimacy on the accusation it would not otherwise have had.\"\n\nResponding to letters from Shirley and his attorneys, Perlstein's publisher, Simon and Schuster, stated that the claims of plagiarism \"ignored the most basic principle of copyright law.\" Those same letters from Shirley's attorneys demanded that Simon and Schuster pay Shirley $25 million in damages, pulp all copies of \"The Invisible Bridge\" and take out ads of apology in various publications. If these demands weren't met, the letters promised that a lawsuit would be filed on July 30, 2014, nearly a week before the book was to be released on August 5. On August 9, 2014, it was reported that there was no evidence a lawsuit had ever been filed. For his part, Perlstein said, \"Mr. Shirley has sued me for $25 million and tried to keep people from reading my book; I've told everyone to read his book.\"\n\nIn the September 2014 issue of \"The Atlantic\", former \"New York Times Book Review\" editor Sam Tanenhaus wrote that “an insistent vulgarity has overtaken Perlstein’s prose” and that the author “now finds rumor more illuminating than fact.”\n\n\n\n"}

It is the causal agent of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE; previously known as Australian encephalitis or Australian X disease). In humans, it can cause permanent neurological disease or death. MVEV is related to Kunjin virus, which has a similar ecology, but a lower morbidity rate. Although the arbovirus is endemic to Northern Australia, it has occasionally spread to the southern states during times of heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon season via seasonal flooding of the Murray-Darling River system. These outbreaks can be \"...decades apart, with no or very few cases identified in between\".\n\nMVEV is a mosquito-borne virus that is maintained in a bird-mosquito-bird cycle. Water birds from the order Ciconiiformes, including herons and cormorants, provide the natural reservoir for MVEV. The major mosquito vector is \"Culex annulirostris\". Human infection occurs only through bites from infected mosquitoes; the virus cannot be transmitted from person to person.\n\nThe first epidemics of MVE occurred in 1917 and 1918 in Southeastern Australia following years of high rainfall. The virus was isolated from human samples in 1951 during an epidemic in the Murray Valley, Australia.\n\nEpidemics usually occur due to either infected birds or mosquitoes migrating from endemic areas to non-endemic areas. The New South Wales government has placed 'sentinel flocks' of chickens near known bird breeding sites as an early warning system. These flocks are tested for MVE during the mosquito breeding season.\n\nThe majority of MVEV infections are sub-clinical, i.e. do not produce disease symptoms, although some people may experience a mild form of the disease with symptoms such as fever, headaches, nausea and vomiting and only a very small number of these cases go on to develop MVE. In fact, serological surveys which measure the level of anti-MVEV antibodies within the population estimate that only one in 800–1000 of all infections result in clinical disease.\n\nThe incubation period following exposure to the virus is around 1 to 4 weeks. Following infection, a person has lifelong immunity to the virus. When a patient appears to show MVE symptoms and has been in an MVE-endemic area during the wet season, when outbreaks usually occur, MVE infection must be confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, usually by detection of a significant rise of MVE-specific antibodies in the patient's serum.\nOf those who contract MVE, one-quarter die from the disease.\n\nThe scientific study of the genetics of MVEV has been facilitated by the construction and manipulation of an infectious cDNA clone of the virus.\n"}

{"id": "2297237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297237", "title": "Small schools movement", "text": "Small schools movement\n\nThe small schools movement, also known as the Small Schools Initiative, in the United States of America holds that many high schools are too large and should be reorganized into smaller, autonomous schools of no more than 400 students, and optimally under 200. Many private schools of under 200 share design features which draw upon the benefits of organizations of less than 200 people. In the public school version of the Small Schools Movement, students may be given a choice of which small school they want to join. Each of the smaller schools would offer students a feeling of connectedness between students who share the same or similar interests with them. In many ways, the small schools in high schools would resemble the team system of many middle schools across the United States. Small schools allow students to have more individual attention from teachers than most average high schools. Many small schools are created by reforming a failed large school into several small ones in the same building, as is the case with the former Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx in New York City.\n\nSupporters of small schools claim that \"in small schools, student achievement increases... Student attendance improves, graduation rates rise, and college going rates increase. Students are more engaged in their studies and are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities.\" This is due to the fact that students are more likely to be known by all of the adults and children in the school and are much less likely to \"fall through the cracks.\"\n\nDeborah Meier has argued that a small school allows all of the teachers to sit around a single table and to create a culture of shared decision-making. This should be a central component of a school that intends to teach children to become powerful members of a democracy--they should see their teachers acting democratically. Face-to-face democracy is much more likely and practical in a small school.\n\nPositive gains for student achievement within small schools can be seen in Oakland California. According to a study by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University \"small schools in Oakland are outperforming the large schools from which they emerged. In particular, students are completing more rigorous coursework and dropping out at lower rates, compared to the large schools.\" \n\nAccording to \"The American Dream and the Public Schools\" by Jennifer L. Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick, smaller class sizes contribute to students in \"early grades, and consistently challenging academic courses have been demonstrated to help disadvantaged\nchildren achieve, just as they enable middle-class children to achieve.\" \n\n\"Smaller, more intimate learning communities consistently deliver better results in academics and discipline when compared to their larger counterparts. Big schools offer few opportunities to participate.\" \"Students at large schools are more prone to be alienated from their peers or engage in risky behavior.\" \n\nOther benefits of small schools are noted in a study conducted by UCLA stating that \"at their best, small schools are seen as enhancing strong personal bonds, home and community involvement, improved instructional quality and accountability, and improved teacher working conditions and job satisfaction.\"\n\nLeading small schools proponent and founder of the Small Schools Coalition and the Grauer School Dr. Stuart Grauer notes, \"Research shows overwhelmingly that small schools lead to greater student academic gains and personal adjustment. In fact, data justifying this has been available for decades; it's just that policy makers have largely ignored it, no doubt due to the costs of such programs (and, of course, the politics). Right now, armed guards, metal detectors, and expulsions fail to get to the heart of the problem. (To a serious extent, they can actually create repressive conditions which make the problem worse.) Consequently, many people are looking for another way, and small schools can't be ignored much longer.\" Why do we keep building gigantic schools when we have such promising data? Dr. Grauer attributes this not only to economics, but to prevailing myths about American education: \"Our collective memory of high school includes nostalgia such as proms, football games, exciting social lives, romance, and first cars. No matter that such memories do not apply to most students. The average high school student does not attend sporting events; indeed the larger the school, the smaller the percentage of student participation in these activities. For most students, the social scene in large high schools is tough and unforgiving, with sharp distinctions made between the small group of social haves and the far larger masses of have-nots. And high school memories seldom include a significant academic component, let alone an intellectual one ( 2001). In other words, many high schools have activities that everyone speaks of with pride—sacred cows like the marching band, the lacrosse team, the boosters. These untouchable activities represent the school's image, and they can't be changed, even though they serve a very small percentage of students and rarely have any connection to the most basic thing of all: the focus on student learning.\"\n\nSmall schools are gaining popularity in the United States not only with students, but with donors as well. According to the Neal Peirce Column of the Washington Post Writers Group, \"far and away the biggest catalyst is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It has poured over $1 billion in five years into promoting smaller schools in Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and other cities. Just this month New York City announced it was coming on board the small schools movement. It will open 60 schools with 500 students or less -- 41 high schools, four traditional middle schools and 15 based on an innovative sixth- or seventh-through-12th grade model.\" \n\nResearch and the growing data on small schools have provided some evidence regarding their better academic quality in comparison to their larger counterparts.\n\nAccording to Dr. Sharif Shakrani, the co-director of the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University, \"Recent studies suggest students in small public high schools perform better academically, have higher attendance rates, feel safer, experience fewer behavior problems and participate more frequently in extracurricular activities.\" \n\nShakrani also states that \"a number of empirical articles document that students in small public and private high schools have higher achievement levels than those in large schools. Studies found higher student gains in reading, mathematics, science and social studies at small high schools than at large schools. Moreover, small schools are more likely to have fewer incidents of violence and misbehavior and that, in turn, has been found to contribute to higher attendance and lower drop-out and truancy rates.\" \n\nSmall schools tend to emerge, particularly in urban areas, where there is a need for education reform due to failing school systems. High quality small public schools act as a remedy to large public schools that are falling behind in their ability to graduate students, achieve higher test scores and provide students with individual attention. The small school movement has modeled its efforts after small private schools which provide a similar learning environment which is based upon providing for the needs of their students.\n\nMany criticisms stem from the fact that the term \"small school\" is not uniform. For instance, schools of between 400 and 1200 students are often researched as small schools despite having few of the attributes of small schools (e.g., a community of 200 or less, class size of less than 15, and similar criteria often applied).\nHence, they point out that large schools tend to have a wider diversity of course offerings, as well as more clubs, arts programs, higher performing sports teams, and other extracurricular activities such as school newspapers and social events. Small schools advocates point out that in schools of less than 400 and especially less than 230, students have more access to enrichment and leadership programs. Some schools have abandoned the small school approach after failures to overcome these difficulties, even after being offered grants to continue these experiments. Other districts have expanded this movement by shutting down large schools and opening more smaller ones. The Gates Foundation, which supports and funds small schools, is beginning to change its focus to working directly on improving instruction, giving grants to improve math and science instruction, for example.\n\n\n"}

She began her career as a lithographer and painter of portraits, collaborating with Walter Anderson on portraits of American Episcopal bishops. Her work, \"Elaine\", was the first public collection purchase of a woman artist. Her painting \"No Walk Today\" was purchased for more than £1 million.\n\nSophie was born in Paris, the daughter of Charles Antoine Colomb Gengembre, a French architect and artist, and his English wife, Marianne Farey (1779-1883), a daughter of John Farey Sr (1766-1826) and his wife Sophia Hubert. They married at St Pancras Church, London, on 12 April 1818 Her father was born in 1790 and began working as an architect at age 19. He worked primarily in municipal commissions, like the Mint of the City of Cassel, which he designed and built when he was 19. He was injured during the Revolution of 1830 on the same day that his son Philip was born. The family then went to London, where Gengembre worked as an architect for Charles Fourier. He returned to France and continued his work as an architect, designing communal schools around France. \n\nThe family moved to America and adopted the surname Hubert, because of difficulties in people pronouncing their french surname.\n\nAfter moving to Cincinnati, Ohio, he settled in Manchester, Pennsylvania, and by 1863 had designed \"pro bono\" the Allegheny City Hall. He stopped speaking English in protest after he was offered a share of the graft of over-inflated construction costs.\n\nThey lived in Paris during the early years of Sophie's life, where her father was acquainted with artists, intellectuals, and actors, like François Joseph Talma. Circumstances required that the family leave Paris and live in a \"remote area in France\" from 1829 to 1843. At seventeen she developed an interest in art when a travelling portrait painter visited her town.\n\nShe had two brothers, Philip and Henry P. Gengembre. Her brother Philip changed his name to Philip Hubert, using his grandmother's maiden name, and was a successful architect in New York City. She was largely self-taught in art, but briefly studied portrait painting with Charles de Steuben in about 1843, when she lived with family friends in Paris. Soon after she began her studies, he left for Russia and did not return within the one year allotted for her studies. She did develop relationships with other women artists at the school where she gained a little more instruction.\n\nThe family left France for the United States to escape the 1848 revolution. The family first settled in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she met her future husband, the British genre artist Walter Anderson. Her brother Henry P. Gengembre (b. 1825) was also an artist, active in Cincinnati in the early 1850s.\n\nHer portrait, figure and Brittany landscape paintings were exhibited in October 1849 at the Western Art Union Gallery. Also exhibited was a three panel set of Victorian London scenes entitled \"The Ladder of Love\", which was described as \"the lady, in her flowery 'May of Life,' awaits in her father's garden a stolen interview with her lover; in the second, she is seen eagerly caught in his impatient arms, ere he has yet left the ladder upon which he surmounted the garden wall; in the third, having received and given reveals of unfaltering love, she walks alone again – beautiful in the enrobing light of a summer moon, happy in the assurance that the warmth and devotedness of her affection is reciprocated.\"\n\nIn 1851 four or more of her illustrations were included in the \"Historical Collections of the Great West\" by Henry Howe. She collaborated with Walter Anderson, her future husband, on portraits of Protestant Episcopal bishops and created other portraits in her business.\n\nShe then lived in Manchester, Pennsylvania, with her parents, where she is believed to have married Walter Anderson. She worked there for the chromolithographers Louis Prang & Company.\n\nIn 1854 the Andersons moved to London, where Sophie exhibited a still life of fruit, vegetables, game and fish entitled \"An American Market Basket\" at the Society of British Artists by 1855. It was considered an \"admirable composition\" made with \"surprising truth\". Her genre pieces were also exhibited at the Royal Academy. They returned to Pennsylvania in 1858 for a long visit with her family, during which time she exhibited at the Pittsburgh Artist's Association in 1859 and 1860. The latter year she and her husband had work shown at the National Academy of Design. She then settled in London again around 1863.\nAnderson's work was widely exhibited at venues including the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists (RBA), and the British Institution. Her work, \"Elaine\", was the first public collection purchase of a woman artist. The Marquis de Murrieta contributed the painting \"A Fairy Messenger\" to a mixed charity exhibition in 1871.\n\nHer oil painting \"Foundling Girls at Prayer in the Chapel\" (mid-c19th – late-c19th) is displayed at the Foundling Museum; correlating well with Anderson's typical genre painting of children and women and the Museum's focus. The painting depicts the varying ages of the foundling girls, what they wore, and references the religious aspects of their life.\n\nTo manage her health issue, the couple moved to the Isle of Capri in 1871, where they lived, painted, and entertained society in a house with a large garden called Villa Castello. Capri was an artist colony at that time, its residents included Frederic Leighton, Walter McLaren, John Singer Sargent, Edouard Alexandre Sain, and Jean Benner. She exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery between 1878 and 1887. Anderson made Italian genre and Neoclassical paintings, including paintings of peasant women and children. At a time when it was difficult for women to have a successful artistic career, these paintings, generally made by men, allowed for her to have a successful career.\n\nThe couple moved to England in 1894 and lived and painted in Wood Lane Cottage in Falmouth, Cornwall. She continued to exhibit her work in London. On 11 January 1903 her husband Walter died and two months later, on 10 March 1903, she died at home in Falmouth. She was buried at Swanvale cemetery in Falmouth in the same grave as her husband.\n\nA world record price for her work of more than £1 million was achieved by \"No Walk Today\" at Sotheby's, London, in November 2008. It made her \"Cornwall's first million-pound female artist.\"\n\nAnderson's work is in the collection of numerous museums and galleries, mainly in the United Kingdom, including New Walk Museum & Art Gallery; Leicestershire Museum and Art Gallery; Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum, Bournemouth; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; Birmingham City Art Gallery; Museum and Art Gallery, Walsall, Staffordshire; and the Wolverhampton Art Gallery, Staffordshire.\n\n\n\n"}

New multi-engine graduates were shipped to Liberal to transition to the Liberator, then sent to 1st Phase bases to join a crew for combat training.\n\nBefore April 1944 Liberal was home to a Twin Engine Flying Training Group with four squadrons (60, 63, 1029, 1030), the 527th Base Hq & Air Base Sq, 324th Sub Depot, 444th (later 744th) AAF Band, and 396th Aviation Sq.\n\nThese units later merged into the 2425th AAF Base Unit (Pilot School, Specialized, Four Engine).\n\nAirline flights (on Central Airlines DC-3s) began in 1956; successor Frontier Airlines left in 1981.\n\nThe airport covers 2,005 acres (811 ha) at an elevation of 2,885 feet (879 m). It has two concrete runways: 4/22 is 5,721 by 150 feet (1,744 x 46 m) and 17/35 is 7,105 by 100 feet (2,166 x 30 m).\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 38,300 aircraft operations, average 104 per day: 91% general aviation, 5% airline, 3% air taxi, and 1% military. 54 aircraft were then based at this airport: 68% single-engine, 24% multi-engine, 6% jet and 2% helicopter.\n\nThe Mid-America Air Museum is located on the airport.\n\n"}

Their best known songs are \"John Wayne Is Big Leggy\", released in 1982 and \"Shiny Shiny\", released in 1983.\n\nHaysi Fantayzee was an avant-garde, new wave pop project emanating from the Blitz Kids street arts scene in London in the early 1980s. The group's music combined reggae, country and electro with political and sociological lyrics couched as nursery rhymes.\n\nCatapulted to stardom by their visual sensibilities, Haysi Fantayzee combined their extreme clothes sense – described as combining white Rasta, tribal chieftain and Dickensian styles – with a quirky musical sound comparable to, but distinct from, other new wave musical pop acts of the era, such as Bow Wow Wow, Adam and the Ants and Bananarama. They appeared several times on the BBC Television programme \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nThe band was formed in 1981 and consisted of Jeremy Healy (also known as \"Jeremiah\"), Kate Garner, and Garner's boyfriend songwriter/producer/manager Paul Caplin. They released four singles in 1982 and 1983: \"John Wayne is Big Leggy\", \"Holy Joe\", \"Shiny Shiny\", and \"Sister Friction\". They followed up with an album, \"Battle Hymns for Children Singing\". Their video for the 1983 hit \"Shiny Shiny\" features a brief appearance by Sopranos actor Michael Imperioli. \n\nBefore they were signed, the band attracted attention by sending video performances with their demo tapes to record companies, a highly unusual practice at the time. Their outfits were often designed by Garner, and the two singers looked like distorted mirror images of each other, with similar hair and make-up. \n\nIn a 1983 interview with David Maples on the Los Angeles-based TV show \"MV3\", Jeremy Healy accused the singer known as Boy George (George O'Dowd) of imitating his unusual look. Boy George later responded: \"When Jeremy saw my locks he was livid. Both he and Kim [Bowen] stopped speaking to me. They thought I had stolen their look. It wasn't their look to steal...\"\n\nGarner also appeared alongside Bananarama in the music video for \"Who's That Girl\" by Eurythmics. She had a brief solo career after the break-up of Haysi Fantayzee, and then pursued a career in photography in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHealy released the single \"When Malindy Sings\" in 1984, and later became a DJ and album mixer for other artists, including his former schoolfriend, Boy George. He recorded on George's More Protein record label under the name E-Zee Possee.\n\nCaplin went on to a career as an entrepreneur. He founded several technology firms, most recently Caplin Systems Ltd, which he sold in 2014. He now makes music with his wife Zeeteah Massiah.\n\n\n"}

Most stories in \"Big Bang Comics\" take place either on \"Earth-A,\" during the 1960s, or on \"Earth-B\" during the 1940s, with characters like Ultiman, Thunder Girl, and Dr. Weird.\n\n\"Big Bang Comics\" first appeared in 1994, with a five-issue limited series (numbered 1–4 and 0), published by Caliber Comics. A second series lasting 35 issues was published by Image Comics from 1996 to 2001.\n\nGary Carlson was exposed to Dr. Weird (who originally appeared in the fanzine \"Star-Studded Comics\" #1 in 1963) in one of the character's earliest collected appearances, \"Comic Crusader Storybook\" #1 (Al Greim, 1977), in a story by Howard Keltner and Dennis Fujitake. (\"The Comic Crusader Storybook\" was a trade paperback fanzine anthology which included short stories featuring the work of many independent artists and writers.) In 1994, Carlson co-created the \"Big Bang\" anthology series, alongside artist/writer Chris Ecker. (In the 1990s Carlson wrote \"Berzerker\" for Caliber Press; one of the first canonical appearances of a Big Bang Comics character was by the Knight Watchman in \"Berzerker\" #1 [Feb. 1993].) In 1993, Carlson and Edward DeGeorge acquired all rights to Dr. Weird from Howard Keltner, eventually folded him into the Big Bang universe and making him the only character with a genuine pedigree.\n\nThrough 2005, Image Comics published 35 issues of \"Big Bang Comics\", followed by seven one-shot comics.\n\nAs of the 2010s, Carlson self-publishes \"Big Bang Presents\". Like its predecessor series \"Big Bang Comics\", this is an anthology featuring a rotating cast of new and established characters in a self-contained fictional universe, written by Carlson and drawn by Ecker and various other artists. The company has also begun reprinting earlier comics in trade paperback form through Pulp 2.0 press.\n\nSome of the iconic characters in the Big Bang Universe include:\n\nSuperhero teams in the Big Bang Universe include the Round Table of America, the Knights of Justice, the Pantheon of Heroes, and the Whiz Kids.\n\nTo give more depth to the various characters, in the world of Big Bang Comics, several invented publishing imprints were created which supposedly existed in the Golden Age and the Silver Age (a device later used by Amalgam Comics).\n\nAll of these false covers appeared on the reverse of the Caliber Press limited series issues in scaled-down shots, and again as full-page replicas in \"Big Bang #0\".\n\nA TV movie of the Knights of Justice was made in 2000. Although it featured the Golden Age versions of Ultiman and Thunder Girl and used the name of the company's Golden Age superteam, the team also included Knight Watchman and a heroine called Masker (who appeared in BB #21), both of whom are exclusively Silver Age heroes in the published version of the universe. The team's mission was to defeat a supervillain and prove their usefulness to the President or face being disbanded.\n\nThe movie is loosely based on the hyperactive Saturday-morning shows of the 1970s that combined special effects with live action, yielding a clearly Silver Age feel to the action.\n\nA pen-and-paper role-playing game has also been released for Big Bang Comics (Pisces All Media, 2006). The Big Bang Comics RPG uses a streamlined version of the D20 system.\n\n\n"}

This contrasts with superficial veins that are close to the body's surface.\n\nDeep veins are almost always beside an artery with the same name (e.g. the femoral vein is beside the femoral artery). Collectively, they carry the vast majority of the blood. Occlusion of a deep vein can be life-threatening and is most often caused by thrombosis. Occlusion of a deep vein by thrombosis is called \"deep vein thrombosis\".\n\nBecause of their location deep within the body, operation on these veins can be difficult.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Fubuki\" class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies. \"Shikinami\", built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal was the second in an improved series, which incorporated a modified gun turret which could elevate her main battery of Type 3 127 mm 50 caliber naval guns to 75° as opposed to the original 40°, thus permitting the guns to be used as dual purpose guns against aircraft. \"Shikinami\" was laid down on 6 July 1928, launched on 22 June 1929 and commissioned on 24 December 1929. Originally assigned hull designation “Destroyer No. 46”, she was completed as \"Shikinami\".\n\nThe 4th Fleet Incident occurred only a year after her commissioning, and \"Shikinami\" was quickly taken back to the shipyards to have her hull strengthened.\n\nOn completion, \"Shikinami\", along with her sister ships, , , and , were assigned to Destroyer Division 19 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, \"Shikinami\" covered landing of Japanese forces in Shanghai and Hangzhou. From 1940 on, she was assigned to patrol and cover landings of Japanese forces in south China.\n\nAt the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, \"Shikinami\" was assigned to Destroyer Division 19 of DesRon 3 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Kure Naval District to the port of Samah on Hainan Island, escorting Japanese troopships for landing operations in the Battle of Malaya at the end of 1941.\n\nIn January–February 1942, \"Shikinami\" was assigned to the escort of the aircraft carrier as it conducted air strikes in the Java Sea. During the Battle of Sunda Strait on 1 March, \"Shikinami\" entered the battle late, but contributed by firing the final torpedo, which sank the United States Navy heavy cruiser . She escorted troopship convoys from Saigon to Rangoon through the remainder of March. From 13–22 April, she returned via Singapore and Camranh Bay to Kure Naval Arsenal, for maintenance.\n\nOn 4–5 June, \"Shikinami\" participated in the Battle of Midway as part of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto’s main fleet. \"Shikinami\" sailed from Amami-Ōshima to Mako Guard District, Singapore, Sabang and Mergui for a projected second Indian Ocean raid. The operation was cancelled due to the Guadalcanal campaign, and \"Shikinami\" was ordered to Truk instead, arriving in late August. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August, \"Shikinami\" escorted the fleet supply group to Guadalcanal. She was assigned to numerous \"Tokyo Express\" transport missions to various locations in the Solomon Islands in October and November.\n\nDuring the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 14–15 November 1942 \"Shikinami\" was attached to a scouting force under the command of Rear Admiral Shintarō Hashimoto in the light cruiser . \"Shikinami\" survived the battle without damage, and returned to Kure by the end of the year.\n\nIn January 1943, \"Shikinami\" escorted a troop convoy from Pusan to Palau and on to Wewak. For the remainder of January–February, she patrolled out of Truk or Rabaul. On 25 February, \"Shikinami\" was reassigned to the IJN 8th Fleet.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Bismarck Sea on 1–4 March, \"Shikinami\" escorted a troop convoy from Rabaul to Lae. She survived the Allied air attack on 3 March which sank her sister ship , and rescued Rear Admiral Masatomi Kimura and other survivors. After returning to Kure briefly in March, \"Shikinami\" continued to serve in an escort and transport role in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea area through the end of October 1943. At the end of October 1943, \"Shikinami\" was refit in Singapore, and assigned to escort of transports between Singapore and Surabaya and Balikpapan for the remainder of the year.\n\nAt the end of January 1944, \"Shikinami\" escorted the cruisers , , , and on a resupply run to the Andaman Islands, and towed the torpedoed \"Kitakami\" back to Singapore afterwards. In a month-long refit in Singapore from mid-March-mid-April, additional anti-aircraft guns were fitted. In May–June, \"Shikinami\" made numerous escort missions between Singapore, the Philippines and Palau. During a troop transport mission to Biak as flagship for Admiral Naomasa Sakonju, \"Shikinami\" came under a strafing air attack, which set fire to her depth charges, which were jettisoned just before they exploded, killing two crewmen and wounding four others. \"Shikinami\" continued to escort ships between Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines from June–August, rescuing the survivors of the torpedoed \"Ōi\" on 19 July. On 12 September, after departing Singapore with a convoy bound for Japan, \"Shikinami\" was torpedoed by the submarine south of Hong Kong at position . Eight officers and 120 men rescued by the destroyer , but her captain — Lieutenant Commander Takahashi — and Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka were killed in action.\n\nOn 10 October 1944, \"Shikinami\" was removed from the navy list.\n\n\n"}
