It was founded in 1854 as a women's college.\n\nHuntingdon College was chartered on February 2, 1854, as \"Tuskegee Female College\" by the Alabama State Legislature and Governor John A. Winston. The first president was Andrew Adgate Lipscomb. Dr. Lipscomb laid the foundation of the college as a teaching college rather than a research institution.\n\nIn 1872 the name was changed to \"Alabama Conference Female College,\" as the college came under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. As the college and the South struggled to rebuild following the Civil War, college leaders believed they needed to relocate the institution to a more populous city, and they chose the state's capital, Montgomery.\n\nIn 1908 they purchased a 58-acre (235,000 m²) parcel of land on what was then the outskirts of town; it is now part of the Old Cloverdale neighborhood of Montgomery. The campus landscaping was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., who had also planned the Biltmore Estate and Central Park. The college, renamed as \"Woman's College of Alabama,\" moved all of its furniture, lab chemicals, and records into Hamner Hall in Montgomery on August 24, 1909. The building burned to the ground that night, destroying the records of the college's first 50 years and all of its furnishings. The students and President William Martin moved to Sullins College in Virginia for that school year, and construction continued on the college's first building, John Jefferson Flowers Memorial Hall. Completed in 1910 and designed by Harvard architect H. Langford Warren, Flowers Hall was designed to emulate the collegiate Gothic architecture of Oxford and Cambridge universities in England, and of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It set the tone that was followed for the architectural style of the campus.\n\nThe college admitted its first male students in the aftermath of World War I, graduating the first male student in 1934. Realizing that the name Woman's College of Alabama no longer fit its student body, the college was renamed in 1935 as Huntingdon College, in honor of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, a notable supporter of John Wesley and of Methodism.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Huntingdon offers more than 20 undergraduate programs of study and 15 NCAA-III intercollegiate athletic teams that participate in the USA South Athletic Conference. Between 2002 and 2012, enrollment increased by 53% in the traditional day program and 88% overall (594 to 1118). The \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" listed Huntingdon in 2014 as among the \"Fastest Growing Colleges in America.\"\n\nHuntingdon's campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Huntingdon College Campus Historic District. The district contains thirteen contributing buildings, built in the Gothic Revival and Tudor Revival styles, and one site. The district was placed on the NRHP on February 24, 2000.\n\nHuntingdon College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III. The Hawks are a member of the USA South Athletic Conference. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball. Huntingdon is the only four-year college in the state of Alabama to offer collegiate wrestling.\n\nHuntingdon College is the home of the \"Red Lady.\" She is alleged to be the ghost of a female student from the early twentieth century who committed suicide inside her room in Pratt Hall.\n\nNotable Huntingdon alumni include:\n\n\n"}

It is on the site of an Augustinian priory founded in 1113 which was dissolved during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1951 it was designated a Grade I Listed Building.\n\nBridlington Priory was founded around 1113 by Walter de Gant, for Augustinian Canons Regular, one of the earliest Augustinian houses in England, with an adjoining convent. Its foundation was confirmed in charters by King Henry I of England The site had formerly been a Saxon church and nunnery. When complete, the building was over and , with a transept which was . The first prior is thought to have been called Guicheman or Wickeman.\n\nThe priory was favoured by kings and their nobles and soon owned land across Yorkshire. The Canons from the priory established Newburgh Priory in 1145. King Stephen granted that the priory should have the right to have the property of felons and fugitives within the town and proceeds from the harbour, and later King John gave the priory the right to hold a yearly fair in the town in 1200. During the conflict between Stephen and Matilda, William le Gros, Earl of Albemarle (a Manor in Holderness which is now ‘lost’) advanced on the priory and expelled the canons in his campaign against Gilbert de Gant of Hunmanby. He fortified the priory and later gave the priory six parcels of land, one at Boynton and the rest in Holderness. Henry IV appropriated the rectory of Scarborough to the priory which was later confirmed by Henry V, Henry VI and Edward IV. A royal licence was also granted by Richard II in 1388 to crenellate the priory with fortifications but although history tells there were four gates, 3 of those gates were in the main priory land, Kirk Gate, West Gate, Nun Gate and these were used as daily entrances in and out of the building enclosure itself. Only the Baylegate was a fortified entrance standing at the borders and the Priory itself was in fact never walled. The priory also had a large library, which was listed by John Leland shortly before the dissolution.\n\nThe priory was dissolved in 1538 by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The priory was very wealthy at the time of the dissolution and its yearly income was estimated to be , and owned land stretching from Blubberhouses in the north, and Askham Richard, down to the Spurn Point.\nThe condition of the priory at the dissolution can be gathered from the report of Richard Pollard, a surveyor of Henry VIII. The Church was more than 390 feet in length, surrounded by the Chapter House, Treasury, Cloister, Prior's Hall, Infirmary. The Quire of the mediaeval church contained woodwork by the celebrated William Brownflete (or Bromflete) who had made the stalls in Beverley Minster, Manchester Cathedral and Ripon Cathedral and a number of churches under the patronage of The Lady Margaret Beaufort, including Gresford and Mold churches, and the chapel of St. John's College Cambridge. All the buildings were destroyed except the Nave which became the parish church and the Gatehouse, which is now the Bayle Gate Museum. Some of the stones from the old priory were used in the construction of the piers at Bridlington. The last Prior, William Wode, was executed at Tyburn for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace.\n\nFor three centuries after the dissolution, the Nave continued to be used as the parish church and only a third of the building was actually used by the congregation. From 1846 the parish began to raise funds to restore the church and it was partially re-roofed; the west window was opened out and filled with stained glass; the interior was white-washed; and the east window also was filled with stained glass. This work was carried out by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin, but their work was not to the satisfaction of the church authorities. Around 1874 the church employed Sir George Gilbert Scott to completely refurbish the church as it is today. The total cost of the restoration was about £27,000.\n\nThe organ was built in 1889 by the Belgian organ builder Charles Anneessens. Various adjustments were made in the 20th century, before it was restored and enlarged between 2004 and 2006 by Nicholson. It has been recorded a number of times and is played by Daniel Moult in the film and recording Virtuoso! Music for Organ.\n\nOrgan Scholars\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr as a married couple whose relationship is shaken by their service in the Second World War. The supporting cast includes Glynis Johns, Ann Todd and Roland Culver. It was produced and directed by Alexander Korda from a screenplay by Clemence Dane and Anthony Pelissier based on a story by Clemence Dane. Dane won the Academy Award for Best Story. The music score was by Clifton Parker and the cinematography by Georges Périnal.\n\nRobert and Cathy Wilson are a timid married couple in 1940 London. He is a bookkeeper, she a bored housewife. However, their tedium-filled lives are drastically changed by the war. He enlists in the Royal Navy, while she joins the Wrens. During the three years the couple are apart (their shore leaves never coincide), they are transformed, each becoming much more self-confident. \n\nCathy's assertive new friend, Dizzy Clayton, helps her break out of her shell. She begins going out with Dizzy's cousin, naval architect Richard, who falls in love with her. However, she remains faithful (if unenthusiastically) to her husband.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert toughens up on sea duty and in time becomes a petty officer. His hands are badly burned when his ship is sunk, but he stoically rows in the lifeboat for five days without complaint. He recuperates in a hospital, tended by Elena, a beautiful nurse. On the last night of his stay, he asks her out to dinner. He is attracted to her, but she informs him that she lost her beloved husband only six months earlier, kisses him, and leaves.\n\nRobert and Cathy both receive ten-day leaves, but each dreads being reunited with the dowdy spouse each remembers and being forced back into the dreary life they shared. \n\nCathy cannot bring herself to return to her flat, where Robert is waiting. Instead, she phones Robert and asks him to talk with her on more neutral ground, blurting out that she wants to leave him. He is furious. They meet on the street, in the pitch dark of the blackout. Robert readily agrees to a divorce, to her surprise, telling her that he was going to ask her for one. They go to the neighbourhood pub to discuss the divorce and for the first time in three years they each get a good look at the transformation in the other. \n\nThroughout the film, they have been talking to their new friends about their life together, and now they revisit those issues and talk honestly to each other about the past. They find that if they are \"perfect strangers\" now, they did not know each other very well before. For Cathy, the hated view from their flat, all walls and smoking chimneys, is a symbol of their lives before the war. They dance with each other, for the first time, and are clearly attracted. Dizzy and Robert's friend 'Scotty' meet them in the pub. Both are stunned. Dizzy thinks Cathy is crazy. Scotty calls Cathy a pin-up, but the compliment goes wrong when he shares—at some length—Robert's unflattering descriptions of the 'old' Cathy. She is insulted and furious. It hardens her heart and she walks out as the pub closes. Outside, waiting in vain for a taxi in the bombed-out intersection, the argument continues—they even fight over where the shops were located. In the end, Scotty goes to his billet, leaving Robert on the street, thinking (in a voiceover). The girls go to the flat, where Cathy wistfully tells Dizzy about how she and Robert met. Robert returns to retrieve his gear and finds Cathy sitting in the window. The sky is bright with early morning light, and beyond the shattered houses, the vista toward the river and beyond is broken only by a church steeple. The high walls are gone.\n\n“You've certainly got the view you always wanted.” Robert says. \n\n“Miles and miles of it,” Cathy replies. “But oh Robert, the desolation.” \n\n“Poor old London.,” he says. “Well, we'll just have to build it up again.” \n\n“It will take years and years.” she says. \n\n“But what of that Cathy,” he answers, smiling. “We're young.” \n\nThey embrace, passionately.\n\n\nCast notes\n\n\"Perfect Strangers\" was based on a story by Esther McCracken and a screen treatment by Arthur Wimperis. It was meant to be the first of what was supposed to be a number of co-productions between Alexander Korda and M-G-M made in Britain - other proposed projects included \"Lottie Dundasd\" with Vivien Leigh from a story by Edith Bagnold, a biopic of Robert Louis Stevenson starring Robert Donat, a version of \"War and Peace\" directed by Orson Welles and starring Korda's wife, Merle Oberon, \"Velvet Coat\" by GB Stern and an untitled Carol Reed project. \"Perfect Strangers\" was originally meant to star Donat and Oberon but by December 1943 Oberon had been replaced by Deborah Kerr, as Oberton was still in the USA. Wesley Ruggles was to come over from Hollywood to direct.\n\nBy March 1944, the film was about to start filming at Denham Studios. Korda announced he would now make only 1-3 films per year, compared to the 12-16 he had previously intended to make.\n\nShooting did not actually begin until May. The delay had come about for several reasons: the script was constantly rewritten to account for changes in the war, Ruggles fell ill with the flu shortly after he arrived in England, and Donat was involved in a play. Then Donat fell ill and Ruggles left the project after an argument with Korda. It was the first feature Korda had directed since \"Rembrandt\". Korda called the film an \"allegory of England\"; Donat referred to it as \"a lyrical comedy\".\n\nThe film did some location shooting in Scotland, but was shot primarily in London.\n\nNo subsequent films came from the agreement, because Korda bristled at being bossed around by MGM's head of production, Louis B. Mayer.\n\n\"Perfect Strangers\" was a commercial success in both the UK and the US, where it was re-titled \"Vacation from Marriage\". It was one of the biggest hits at the British box office in 1945.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" called it \"second grade Korda but [it] hit the mood of the moment with its theme of the marital problems of demobilization.\"\nClemence Dane won an Academy Award for Best Original Motion Picture Story for \"Perfect Strangers\".\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

His son Francis was named in a 1612 lease of property in Cowbit, Lincolnshire and either John or Eleanor, or both, were associated with this area. Around Cowbit and Spalding, in Lincolnshire, Francis Longland named young Francis Billington, son of John Billington, an heir.\n\nJohn Billington, his wife Elinor and their two sons, John and Francis, departed on the \"Mayflower\" from Plymouth, Devon, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to what would eventually be fatal for many, especially the majority of women. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh New England winter.\n\nOn November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. Billington signed the Mayflower Compact that day.\n\nThe Billington family appeared a number of times in the accounts of early Plymouth Colony and were reported to be the colony's troublemakers. Francis made squibs and fired a musket in the \"Mayflower\" while the ship was anchored off Cape Cod. Francis went exploring soon after their arrival and discovered the body of water now known as Billington Sea.\n\nIn March 1621 John Senior challenged Myles Standish's orders for \"contempt of the Captain's lawful command with several speeches\" and was punished for it. He would do this many times more.\n\nIn May 1621 John Billington (the younger) became lost in some woods for several days, eventually being returned home by some natives from Nauset on Cape Cod.\n\nIn 1624 John Billington was implicated in the Oldham-Lyford scandal (a revolt against the rule of the Plymouth church), but insisted he was innocent and was never officially punished.\n\nIn 1625 Governor Bradford wrote a letter to Robert Cushman saying \"Billington still rails against you…he is a knave, and so will live and died.\"\n\nIn 1636, wife Elinor (Eleanor) was sentenced to sit in the stocks and be whipped for slandering John Doane.\n\nJohn Billington married Elinor Lockwood in England. They had two sons. After John's death, Elinor married Gregory Armstrong in September 1638. Elinor died after March 2, 1642/3. Gregory Armstrong died in Plymouth on November 5, 1650.\n\nChildren of John and Elinor Billington:\n\nIn September 1630 John Billington was tried by a jury and hanged for the murder of John Newcomen, whom he saw as an enemy. This was the first such execution in Plymouth colony. Bradford states he was approximately forty years of age. His burial location is unknown.\n\n"}

The PGC was, at the time of its release, the most advanced graphics card for the IBM XT and aimed for tasks such as CAD.\n\nIntroduced in 1984, the Professional Graphics Controller offered a maximum resolution of 640×480 with 256 colors at a refresh rate of 60 Hertz—a higher resolution and color depth than CGA and EGA supported. This mode is not BIOS-supported. It was intended for the computer-aided design market and included 320 kB of display RAM and an on-board Intel 8088 microprocessor. The 8088 ran software routines such as \"Draw Polygon\" and \"Fill Area\" from an on-board 64kB ROM so that the host CPU didn't need to load and run these routines itself. While never widespread in consumer-class personal computers, its US $4,290 list price compared favorably to US$50,000 dedicated CAD workstations of the time (even when the $4,995 price of a PC XT model 87was included). It was discontinued in 1987 with the arrival of VGA and 8514.\n\nThe board was targeted at the CAD market, therefore limited software support is to be expected. The only software known to support the PGC are IBM's Graphical Kernel System, P-CAD 4.5, Canyon State Systems CompuShow and AutoCAD 2.5.\n\nPGC supports:\n\nThe display adapter was composed of three physical circuit boards (one with the on-board microprocessor, firmware ROMs and video output connector, one providing CGA emulation, and the third mostly carrying RAM) and occupied two adjacent expansion slots on the XT or AT motherboard; the third card was located in between the two slots. The PGC could not be used in the original IBM PC without modification due to the different spacing of its slots.\n\nIn addition to its native 640 x 480 mode, the PGC optionally supported the documented text and graphics modes of the Color Graphics Adapter, which could be enabled using an onboard jumper. However, it was only partly register-compatible with CGA.\n\nThe PGC's matching display was the IBM 5175, an analog RGB monitor that is unique to it and not compatible with any other video card without modification. With hardware modification, the 5175 can be used with VGA, Macintosh, and various other analog RGB video sources. Some surplus 5175s in VGA-converted form were still sold by catalog retailers such as COMB as late as the early 1990s .\n\n\n\n\n"}

As such, Ango Sakaguchi was associated with the Buraiha or 'Decadent' School (無頼派 buraiha, the school of irresponsibility and decadence), which designated a group of dissolute writers who expressed their perceived aimlessness and identity crisis of post-World War II Japan.\n\nIn 1946 he wrote his most famous essay, titled \"Darakuron\" (\"Discourse on Decadence\"), which examined the role of bushido during the war. It is widely argued that he saw postwar Japan as decadent, yet more truthful than a wartime Japan built on illusions like bushido. (The work itself does not make any claims about the meaning of decadence.)\n\nAngo was born in 1906 and was the 12th child of 13. He was born in the middle of a Japan perpetually at war. His father was the president of the Niigata Shimbun newspaper, a politician, and a poet.\n\nAngo wanted to be a writer at 16. He moved to Tokyo at 17, after hitting a teacher who caught him truanting. His father died from brain cancer the following year, leaving his family in massive debt. At 20, Ango taught for a year as a substitute teacher following secondary school. He became heavily involved in Buddhism and went to University to study Indian philosophy, graduating at the age of 25. Throughout his career as a student, Ango was very vocal in his opinions.\n\nHe wrote various works of literature after graduating, receiving praise from writers such as Makino Shin’ichi. His literary career started around the same time as Japan's expansion into Manchuria. He met Yada Tsuseko to get very along with, at 27 (non-sexual connection). His mother died when he was 37, in the middle of World War II. He struggled for recognition as a writer for years before finally finding it with “A Personal View of Japanese Culture” in 1942, and again with “On Decadence” in 1946. \n\nIn 1947, Ango Sakaguchi wrote an ironical murder mystery, 'Furenzoku satsujin jiken' ('The Non-serial Murder Incident', translated and published in French as 'Meurtres sans série'), for which he received in 1948 the Mystery Writers of Japan Award. Ango had a child at 48 with his wife, Michiyo Kaji. He died from a brain aneurysm at age 48 in 1955, in Kiryū, Gunma.\n\n\n\nFor more on Sakaguchi's role in postwar Japan, see John Dower's book \"Embracing Defeat\", pp. 155–157.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1969634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969634", "title": "Northeast-10 Conference", "text": "Northeast-10 Conference\n\nThe Northeast-10 Conference is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)’s Division II level. Member institutions are located in the northeastern United States in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. It is the only Division II collegiate hockey conference in the United States.\n\nThe original 1980 conference was called the \"Northeast 7\" as the colleges were American International College, Assumption College, Bentley College, Bryant College, the University of Hartford, Springfield College, and Stonehill College. In 1981, Saint Anselm College was the eighth team to join and the resulting \"NE-8\" stayed this way until 1984 when the University of Hartford left and Merrimack College joined.\n\nThe “Northeast-10” name came about in 1987 when Saint Michael's College and Quinnipiac College joined the league. The conference remained stable until 1995 when Springfield College left for Division III. The league stayed at ten members as Le Moyne College joined the league in 1996 from the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) and briefly expanded to eleven when Pace University joined in 1997 from the New York Collegiate Athletic Conference (NYCAC). Quinnipiac moved to the Division I Northeast Conference (NEC) to again return the membership to ten.\n\nThe last major expansion took place prior to 2000, when five new schools joined the fold. Franklin Pierce College, Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU; formerly New Hampshire College), the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UMass Lowell), and Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) were joined by the College of Saint Rose giving the NE-10 15 members. In 2008, Bryant University announced it would begin the five-year process that would make them a full Division I member by 2012; at the same time the NE-10 announced that it had given a bid to University of New Haven and they had accepted. In December 2007, Adelphi University announced it had joined the league and began playing in 2009–10. To start the 2008–09 academic year the NE-10 still had 15 members and expanded to 16 in 2009-10.\n\nWith that major expansion, the NE-10 now stands as the second-largest NCAA Division II conference in the nation. The strength in numbers was the guiding force in the addition and strengthening of a number of championship sports the league now offers. However, because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, UMass Lowell left the NE-10 to join the Division I America East Conference. With the departure of UMass Lowell, the Northeast-10 Conference has 15 remaining members.\n\nSince the addition of those five institutions, the league has added football, indoor track and field, and outdoor track and field as championship sports. While the expansion has added championships in certain sports, it has also increased the championship opportunities for countless student-athletes with the expansion of postseason tournaments for sports such as field hockey, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's lacrosse, and baseball.\n\nThe expansion continued in 2003–04 as the conference added another three championships to its diverse menu – men's swimming and diving, women's swimming and diving, and men's ice hockey – the only Division II ice hockey conference in the nation. The conference also continued to expand in the classroom. Each year, the NE-10 honors a record number of scholar athletes to the Commissioner's Honor Roll.\n\nThe most recent changes to the conference membership, both taking effect with the 2019–20 school year, were announced in 2018. First, Merrimack announced that it would begin a transition to Division I and join the Northeast Conference (the same move that Bryant made in 2008). \nThen, Long Island University announced that it would unify its two athletic programs—the Division I LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and the Division II LIU Post Pioneers, the latter of which was a NE-10 affiliate member in field hockey and football at the time of announcement—into a single D-I athletic program under the LIU name. As such, the LIU Post field hockey team was merged with LIU Brooklyn's previously existing team in that sport, and the LIU Post football team became the new LIU football team, competing as a Division I FCS team in the Northeast Conference. Thus, the NE-10 now has a total of 14 member schools.\n\nDavid Brunk, the first full-time commissioner in league history, announced in April he was resigning July 1, 2007 to take over the Peach Belt Conference. Brunk had been commissioner since 1998. Julie Ruppert became the next full-time commissioner in June 2008, becoming the first female Division II commissioner in the country.\n"}

It was known as The Micallef Program in its first series, The Micallef Programme in its second series and The Micallef Pogram in its third series. \"The Micallef P(r)ogram(me)\" is an umbrella title used for the DVD releases.\n\nAiring on Mondays (Friday for the second season) at 8pm, the show took the loose guise of a fictional variety show that featured mock interviews, host monologues, audience participation segments and competitions, bookending character-based sketches. The characters of Milo Kerrigan and David McGhan from Micallef's previous sketch series \"Full Frontal\" also reappeared in this series. The show was written and produced by Micallef and Gary McCaffrie: the small number of writers and small cast, as well as the different requirements of the ABC, meant that the show was far more surreal and abrupt than \"Full Frontal\" - the humour was frequently bizarre (notoriously evidenced by \"Attentione il est MYRON!\", a recurring parody of European claymation programs).\n\nAs host, Micallef adopted the persona of an arrogant, thin-skinned, self-obsessed pedant. His monologues featured a large amount of deliberately confusing wordplay (garden path sentences; for example, \"As a Chinese person who is bilingual might say, 'gute Nacht!'\"), and his interviews would revolve around him confusing and belittling his guests, both real and fictional: these included John Clarke, Tim Freedman of The Whitlams, Tim Rogers, and Andrew Denton. To balance this out, however, Micallef tended to play shabby and frequently crazy \"low status\" characters (such as Kerrigan) in the sketches, and was himself frequently humiliated by the other members of the cast.\"\n\nAs the program went on, it became stranger and more surreal. The third series was particularly notable for this, and gained much media coverage from a sketch that never made it to air. The sketch was supposed to show Shaun introducing a segment in which war hero Weary Dunlop would be shown as a transsexual and a few seconds into the sketch it would cut to the ABC switchboard lighting up with complaints. However, the sketch got complaints before it was even shown and subsequently never went to air - the irony of the situation lost on many of those who complained. Micallef made light of this by putting several sketches in his book \"Smithereens\" that ended with Dunlop entering in a dress. The sketch is however contained in the DVD release of the third series and appeared in the ABC TV retrospective series, \"Shock Horror Aunty\".\n\nAlthough the show made frequent use of minor celebrities, it shied away from direct parodies of television or actors, although the David E. McGhan character performed in stereotypical medical and legal dramas in the first two series. Its use of popular culture was better demonstrated in the opening show of the third series, where chanteuse Julie Anthony gave a strange rendition of Mi-Sex's 1979 hit \"Computer Games\" while a small dog pulled around a plastic cart with a single orange in it.\n\nThe show featured the talents of Wayne Hope, Roz Hammond, Francis Greenslade and, in the third series, Daina Reid. Micallef would go on to host a short-lived \"real\" variety show, \"Micallef Tonight\", for the Nine Network in 2003.\n\nThe name of the show changed each series, due to audience complaints which Micallef turned into a running gag. The first series, entitled \"The Micallef Program\", encountered complaints from ABC viewers who objected to the spelling of \"program\", despite this being the standard Australian spelling. This linguistic issue is particularly sensitive among viewers of the ABC, which broadcasts a relatively large amount of British content. In the second series, which began on 20 August 1999 and ended on 8 October 1999, the title was changed to the British spelling of \"The Micallef Programme\", and Micallef \"thanked\" his viewers in the series premiere:\n\nIn the third series Micallef continued this gag, mispronouncing program as 'PO-gram'. When the ABC literature advertising the show changed it to \"The Micallef Pogram\", the closeness to the word \"pogrom\" made what Micallef called \"a far darker joke than was ever intended\".\n\nThe second series was released on DVD in 2004, preceding the first and third series because the distributor, Shock Records, thought that the second series was most marketable. The third series was released in November 2005, and the first series was released in early 2006. A combined boxset of all three series called \"Micallef in a Box\" was released on 28 November 2006. Writing on the cover of the boxed set notes: \"You own the award winning second and third series, now for the sake of completeness you can own all three\".\n\nIn 2011, Shock Records released a box DVD set, \"The Collected Shaun Micallef\", which included all three seasons of \"The Micallef Program\" along with \"The Incompleat Shaun Micallef\", a compilation of his work on \"Full Frontal\" together with a Seven Network pilot \"Shaun Micallef's World Around Him\", \"The Expurgated Micallef Tonight\" (highlights of Micallef's short-lived 2003 show \"Micallef Tonight\" on the Nine Network) and a bonus audio CD \"His Generation\".\n\n\n"}

He was best known for his articles for \"The Nation\" in the United States and for \"The Economist\" in Britain, serving for decades as a European correspondent for each magazine.\n\nGore Vidal described Singer as \"one of the best, and certainly the sanest, interpreters of things European for American readers\", with a \"Balzacian eye for human detail.\" Mike Davis labelled Singer \"the left's most brilliant arsonist\", with a talent for \"set[ting] ablaze whole forests of desiccated cliches\".\n\nSinger was born in 1926 in Warsaw, in his parents' home. His father, Bernard Singer, was to become a well-known journalist,\n\nbut was impoverished at the time of Daniel's birth. His mother, Esther Singer, was a teacher, and the child of wealthy Jewish parents. Esther, a Marxist, interested both Daniel and a young Isaac Deutscher in left-wing politics, and specifically the ideas of Marx and Rosa Luxemburg. As Daniel aged, his father became more financially successful, and the family was able to move out of the ghetto. Esther quit her job, and Daniel attended a school where he was the only Jew in his class.\nIn 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Daniel and his sister and mother were staying in southern France. They went to Paris in an attempt to book passage to Warsaw, but could not. Instead, after the occupation of Paris by the Germans, Daniel and his mother and sister left Paris. They went first to Anger, where Daniel went to the Lycée David d'Anger, then to Toulouse (Lyce Lakanal) and after to Marseille (Lycée Thiers). In the beginning of August 1942, the French police came to arrest them; his sister jumped through the window from the second floor, broke her leg and was sent to the hospital; Daniel was away in the countryside with some school friends and learned about his sister coming back home. With the help of the resistance, first Daniel and then his mother and sister escaped to Switzerland. Bernard Singer, meanwhile, was arrested by the Soviet Union, which had occupied eastern Poland under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Bernard was sent to the gulag for two years and released when the USSR entered the war before being allowed to leave for London.\n\nDuring the middle of the Second World War, Daniel studied philosophy in Geneva. In 1944, he and the remainder of his family joined his father in London, where Daniel obtained his bachelor's degree in economics from the University of London.\n\nSinger began working for \"The Economist\" in 1948, with assistance from his old friend Isaac Deutscher, and for the \"New Statesman\" in 1949. His work focused on Poland, France, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union. He remained on staff with \"The Economist\" for 19 years. In this period, he also provided radio and television commentary for the BBC and the Canadian CBC.\n\nIn 1956, Singer married Jeanne Kérel, a French doctoral student in economics in the University of Paris; with a British Council scholarship she spent a year in London in 1952–1953 at the London School of Economics. After their wedding they lived during two years separated. Daniel moved to Paris in May 1958 when he was sent as\"\"The Economist\" correspondent moved to Paris,'.\n\nSinger spent the rest of his life living in Paris, reporting first for \"The Economist\", and then, after 1970, for \"The Nation\", and became in 1980 the magazine's European correspondent. He wrote critically of Charles De Gaulle, François Mitterrand, and the French Communist Party, but was enthusiastic about the events of May 1968.\n\nSinger died in 2000 of lung cancer. He requested that the announcement of his death be accompanied by a quotation from Rosa Luxemburg, still his political idol, shortly before her execution:\nYour order is built on sand. Tomorrow, the revolution will raise its head again, Proclaiming to your horror amidst a blaze of trumpets, \"I was, I am, I always shall be.\"\n\nThe \"Daniel Singer Millennium Prize Foundation\" was established in Singer's name after his death. It offers an annual $2,500 prize for an essay in Singer's spirit.\n\nSinger's writing was always deeply influenced by his interest in politics, and specifically the process of political change. Throughout his adult life, Singer was a socialist, but a critic of the Soviet Union. Influenced by anarchism, Trotskyism, and various newer dissident schools of Marxism, he was devoted ultimately to the political ideas of Marx and Luxemburg.\n\nSinger opposed capitalism, saying that he \"could not resign himself to the idea that with the technological genius at our disposal we are unable to build a different world.\" He denied, however, that capitalism's doom is inevitable, writing \"capitalism has within it the seeds of its own destruction, but only seeds... Capitalism will have to be pushed off the stage.\" Singer believed that this push \"will require a revolution.\"\n\nWhile Singer was an opponent of Stalinism, and believed the French Communist Party in large part responsible for De Gaulle's success in taking power in 1958 and his failure to be overthrown in 1968, he had a nuanced view on the question. He wrote that, \"while the totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable, I find the thesis of \"totalitarian twins\" both wrong and unproductive, and recognised the deep working-class implantation of the CP.\n\nSinger retained an optimism about the prospects for socialism, writing shortly before his death:\nThere is no certainty about the future. Humanity has the capability of destroying itself, and it may very well do so. The hope is with the younger generation. They will not be able to run away from the problems of the world the way our generation did and the next generation has. But our grandchildren will have to deal with the contradictions.\n\n\"Prelude to Revolution: France in May 1968\", first published by Hill and Wang in 1970, is an account of the student uprising and general strike that shook France and imperiled the Gaullist regime in the spring of 1968. Singer argues that the events of May '68, while not a revolution, even a failed one, had the potential to overturn a contradictory French society. However, he claims, they achieved no radical change because the genuine radicals on the non-Communist left had insufficient organisation and influence, while the supposedly radical Communist Party, with sufficient strength to force fundamental change in the crisis, was not actually interested in doing so. According to Percy Brazil, this is the work which established Singer as \"a major political writer.\"\n\n\"The New Republic\" wrote of \"Prelude to Revolution\" that \"if Marx had been living in Paris during May 1968, he might have written this book.\"\n\n\"The Road to Gdansk\", published by Monthly Review Press in 1981, is a collection of essays on Poland, the Soviet Union, and Solidarity. It was described by \"Foreign Affairs\" as \"a sharp and stimulating analysis\", though a review in \"Russian Review\", while praising its discussion of the USSR, notes that \"less than a third\" of the book is devoted to \"a rather superficial analysis\" of events in Poland.\n\n\"Is Socialism Doomed? The Meaning of Mitterrand\" was published by Oxford University Press in 1988. The book dissects the phenomenon of François Mitterrand, who came into office as the first socialist president in French history with \"the most radical program of any offered in the West by a prospective government in at least thirty years\", but by the end of the 1980s had abandoned radicalism and turned the French Socialist Party back into a standard European social democratic party. Singer argued that the disappointment of Mitterrand for socialists demonstrated not that socialism is a futile project, but that Mitterrand had not really attempted it.\n\n\"Whose Millennium? Theirs or Ours?\" was published by Monthly Review Press in 1999. This book, described by Percy Brazil as Singer's \"magnum opus\", challenges the idea that \"there is no alternative\" to capitalism. Instead, Singer argues,\nWe are at a moment, to borrow [Walt] Whitman's words, when society \"is for a while between things ended and things begun,\" not because of some symbolic date on a calendar marking the turn of the millennium, but because the old order is a-dying, in so far as it can no longer provide answers corresponding to the social needs of our point of development, though it clings successfully to power, because there is no class, no social force ready to push it off the historical stage.\nBarbara Ehrenreich described the book as \"magisterial in its historical sweep [and] fiercely democratic in its vision\", providing \"the thinking person's bridge to the 21st Century.\"\n\n\"Deserter from Death: Dispatches from Western Europe 1950–2000\", is a posthumous collection of Singer's journalistic writing over the course of his life, published by Nation Books in 2005. It has an introduction by George Steiner and a preface by Howard Zinn. The title comes from a phrase Singer once used to describe himself, referring to his narrow escape from the Holocaust.\n\n"}

It is a successor to their earlier \"Lamborghini American Challenge\".\n\nIn 1998, an improved version subtitled was released in Japan only. This version was distributed by Taito, presented as a successor to their \"Speed Race\" series from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Improvements include a new difficulty level, the ability to freely customize controls, the introduction of weather, actual pictures of various models of Lamborghini with their names displayed before the demo screen, and other minor changes.\n\n\"Automobili Lamborghini\" is an arcade-style racing game similar to the \"Ridge Racer\" or \"Need for Speed\" (early) series. There are 4 modes of play: Arcade, Championship, Single Race, and Time Trials. Arcade and Championship consist of a series of races and is where the game's various cars can be unlocked; Single Race is a practice mode in normal racing conditions (configurable), while Time Trials is a single player race against the player's best times.\n\nTo challenge these modes, the game features eight vehicles that resemble actual supercars: the two default cars, representing the Lamborghini Diablo and the Lamborghini Countach; and six unlockable cars won by beating the six configurations of championships, representing the Porsche 959, the Ferrari F50, the Ferrari Testarossa, the Dodge Viper, the McLaren F1, and the Bugatti EB110.\n\nIGN gave \"Automobili Lamborghini\" a rating of 7.0 out of 10 overall, despite criticism about the choice of music and the graphics being \"devoid of roadside detail\". Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground gave the game a 7 out of 10 and said it \"ends up only inspiring yawns.\" Lucas praised the game's graphics, but criticized its \"relatively paper thin gameplay,\" its bland colors, and the \"intolerably stupid\" A.I. of the computer-controlled racing opponents. Lucas also felt that the game should have included more cars and tracks, and criticized the game's \"very thin\" sound effects: \"These are sports cars of magnitude. The hums, whines and purrs of these particular 'mobiles should not be taken lightly. However, there are times when it sounds like this is a race of turbo-charged hand blenders.\"\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"It really needs a better sense of speed and more tension, or at least some unique element besides its dream-car license to set it apart. \"AL64\" makes a decent rental, but even at Nintendo's recently lowered prices, it's no steal.\"\n"}

Their range is known to extend to James Bay to the north, and southeastern Manitoba to the west.\n\nThese salamanders are between in length, of which the tail comprises 40%. Their skin is bluish-black, with characteristic blue and white flecks on its back, and bluish-white spots on the sides of its body and tail. They have an elongated body, though they are not nearly as slender as the Jefferson salamander. The vent is typically black, which contrasts with the paler belly. Larvae that have transformed may have yellow splotches; these turn blue once the individual becomes terrestrial. Occasionally, a melanistic individual may be found in the wild.\n\nThey have long toes: four on the front feet and five on the hind feet. Typically, specimens will have 12–14 costal grooves. Males tend to be smaller than females, though they have longer, flattened tails.\n\nBlue-spotted salamanders are primarily found in moist, deciduous hardwood forests and swampy woodlands, though they can be found in coniferous forests and fields too. They prefer vernal pools that retain water into mid-summer, to ensure access to a suitable breeding habitat. Underbrush, leaf litter, rocks and logs are commonly used for shelter. Studies are beginning to show that habitat selection may also be affected by factors such as light pollution and chemical hues.\n\nEggs are laid in small agglomerations attached to twigs, rocks or plants at the edge of a woodland pond or ditch. Clutches average a dozen eggs, and females may lay up to 500 eggs yearly. Males and females first mate when two years old. Breeding occurs in early spring near vernal pools.\n\nEggs take about one month to hatch. At hatching, larvae have a well-developed mouth and eyes. Front limbs form at two weeks, and hind limbs form at three weeks. It will fully transform to its terrestrial state by late summer.\n\nBlue-spotted salamanders are known to be associated with unisexual (all-female) populations of ancient origin. The unisexual females often look like blue-spotted salamanders but have hybrid genomes and require sperm from a co-occurring, related species to fertilize their eggs and initiate development. Usually the eggs then discard the sperm genome and develop asexually (i.e., gynogenesis, with premeiotic doubling); however, they may incorporate the genome from the sperm into the resulting offspring. Sperm incorporation commonly takes the form of genome addition (resulting in ploidy elevation in the offspring), or genome replacement, wherein one of the maternal genomes is discarded. This unique mode of reproduction has been termed kleptogenesis by Bogart and his colleagues.\n\nFemale Tremblay's salamanders (\"Ambystoma tremblayi\") breed with male blue-spotted salamanders from March to April. Eggs are laid singly or in small masses of 6 to 10 eggs on debris at pond bottom. The males' chromosome contribution only stimulates the egg's development; its genetic material is ignored.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969671", "title": "Operation Nickel Grass", "text": "Operation Nickel Grass\n\nOperation Nickel Grass was a strategic airlift operation conducted by the United States to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In a series of events that took place over 32 days, the U.S. Air Force's Military Airlift Command shipped 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery, ammunition, and supplies in C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft between 14 October and 14 November 1973. The U.S. support helped ensure that Israel survived a coordinated and surprise attack from the Soviet-backed Arab Republic of Egypt and Syrian Arab Republic. \n\nFollowing a U.S. pledge of support on 19 October, the oil-exporting Arab states within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held to their previously declared warnings to use oil as a \"weapon\" and declared a complete oil embargo on the United States, and restrictions on other countries. This, along with the contemporaneous failure of major pricing and production negotiations between the exporters and the major oil companies, led to the 1973 oil crisis. Policy makers in Washington learned lessons that decisively shaped subsequent American political and strategic policies especially regarding the Middle East. In addition the operation totally transformed US–Saudi relations.\n\nIsrael, as well as the US and most of the world, were caught by surprise on 6 October 1973 when Egypt and Syria crossed their borders and attacked Israel from the Sinai and the Golan Heights, respectively. In an attempt to undermine the United States ally, the Arab states were trained, prepared and supplied by Moscow. The Soviet Union had supplied Egypt and Syria over 600 advanced surface-to-air missiles, 300 MiG-21 fighters, 1,200 tanks, and hundreds of thousands of tons of war material. Seeing Israel's vulnerable position, Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State and President Richard Nixon's National Security Adviser, made arrangements for El Al to pick up some items, including ammunition, \"high technology products\" and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles at a US naval base in Virginia. A modest effort soon began, but Kissinger still hoped to keep any visible involvement at a minimum. On 8 October, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton nuclear warheads on Jericho missiles and F-4s, which were prepared for action against Syrian and Egyptian targets; their preparation was made easily detectable, likely as a signal to the United States. Kissinger learned of this threatening nuclear escalation on the morning of 9 October. On that same day, Meir issued a personal appeal for military assistance, which European nations declined. U.S. President Richard Nixon, however, ordered the commencement of Operation Nickel Grass, to replace all of Israel's materiel losses. The decision was taken the same day the Soviets began their own resupply operation of Arab forces by sea. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Kissinger had told Anwar Sadat that the reason for the U.S. airlift was that the Israelis were close to \"going nuclear.\" However, subsequent interviews with Kissinger, James Schlesinger, and William Quandt suggested that the nuclear aspect was not a major factor in the decision to re-supply. These officials cited the ongoing Soviet re-supply effort and Sadat's early rejection of a ceasefire as the primary motivators.\n\nInitially, only the Israeli national airline, El Al, provided transport, and supplies began to arrive in Israel on 10 October, the same day the first Soviet resupply by air arrived in Damascus. Nonetheless, it was soon clear that El Al's limited supply of ill-configured passenger aircraft were insufficient. Still wanting to avoid direct US involvement, starting 10 October, the use of commercial carriers was explored to provide 10–20 flights a day. None of these were willing to accept the job for fear of being refused entry to Arab nations after the war. On 12 October, Nixon decided that no more delays could be allowed, and ordered the air force to \"send everything that can fly.\" Within nine hours, C-141s and C-5s were en route to Israel. The political maneuvering was not immediately solved by the air force's participation however: traditional European allies refused to allow re-supply aircraft to land for refueling or even overfly their territory. Portugal seemed willing to help though, so aircraft were dispatched to Lajes Field in the Azores Islands. After a few hours in the air, word came through that Portugal would permit them to land, and Lajes became a key staging point for the rest of the airlift. Strategic Air Command (SAC) KC-135As were the first to arrive at Lajes Air Base. The Stratotankers had left Pease AFB, New Hampshire, the night of Saturday, 13 October (one of the bases El Al was using to re-supply the war effort); the tankers were ferrying factory-fresh Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft flying non-stop from the factory in St. Louis, Missouri to Ben Gurion Airport. To comply with the demands of other European nations, even U.S. supplies already stationed in Europe were routed through Lajes, and soon over thirty aircraft per day were moving through Lajes. To accommodate this, the base grew to house an extra 1,300 people who were billeted in improvised housing and hastily reactivated World War II barracks, rooms that would normally accommodate one or two enlisted men were expanded to four (2 bunk-beds).\n\nBetween Portugal and Israel, the aircraft had to follow an extremely precise route. Flying exactly along the airspace border between hostile Arab nations to the south and European nations to the north, the transport craft flew down the middle of the Mediterranean Sea to Israel. Fighter escort was deemed necessary for this leg of the journey, so American fighters from the U.S. 6th Fleet escorted the transports to within of Israel, where Israeli Air Force Phantoms and Mirages escorted them into Ben Gurion Airport. Along the Mediterranean route, American ships were stationed every , and an aircraft carrier every . These precautions appeared justified when unidentified Arab fighters made threats over the radio, but no conflict ensued. Upon arrival, the transports were unloaded by U.S. and Israeli servicemen before they returned home and supplies were expedited to the front where they arrived within a few hours. The first C-5A Galaxy transport airplane arrived at Lod airport at 18:30 local time on 14 October. That same day the Battle of the Sinai had concluded in Israel's favor. A major Egyptian thrust had been stopped with the destruction of many attacking tanks, and Israel was now winning the war.\n\nAirlifted supplies were not all that was delivered under Nickel Grass. In the opening days of the war, Arab forces destroyed significant numbers of Israeli Air Force aircraft, surprising the Israelis with aggressive use of the new Soviet SA-6 Gainful surface-to-air missile. Consequently, at least 100 F-4 Phantom II fighters were sent to Israel under Nickel Grass, coming from the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, the 33d Tactical Fighter Wing and the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. They were flown to Lod, where American pilots were swapped for their Israeli counterparts. After the replacement of USAF insignia with IAF insignia if needed, the planes were refueled and ordered to the front, often taking to the air within hours of having arrived. Some aircraft came directly from the USAFE fleet and operated in USAF camouflage, but with Israeli insignia, thus earning the Israeli nickname \"Frog\". Nine days after the initial attack, Israel launched counterattacks. Thirty-six A-4 Skyhawks from U.S. stocks, staging from Lajes were refueled by SAC KC-135A tankers from Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire and U.S. Navy tankers from the west of the Strait of Gibraltar. They then flew on to the southeast of Sicily where they stayed overnight, then continued on to Israel refueling once more from tankers launched from the south of Crete. Twelve C-130E Hercules transports were also transferred to Israel, the first of the type to be delivered to the IDF/AF.\n\nWhen the third cease-fire resolution was finally implemented on October 24, the airlift immediately slowed. Further flights were made to rebuild Israeli forces to their pre-war strength, and Operation Nickel Grass was ended on 14 November. In the end, the military airlift shipped 22,325 tons of materiel to Israel. Additionally, the United States conducted its own seaborne re-supply operation, delivering 33,210 tons to Israel by 30 October. During the same general time, the Soviets airlifted 12,500–15,000 tons of supplies, more than half of which went to Syria; they also supplied another 63,000 tons mainly to Syria by means of a sealift.\n\nOperation Nickel Grass had immediate and far-reaching effects. Arab members of OPEC had declared they would limit or stop oil shipments to the United States and other countries if they supported Israel in the conflict. Holding to their threats, the Arab states declared a complete oil embargo on the United States. Oil prices skyrocketed, fuel became scarce, and the United States was soon embroiled in the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nNickel Grass also revealed a severe deficiency in American airlift capabilities: the need for staging bases overseas. Without Portugal's assistance, the airlift might not even have been possible. As a result, the U.S. greatly expanded its aerial refueling capabilities and made long-distance flight operations the standard rather than the exception.\n\nA GAO study of the operation discussed the shortcomings of the C-141A. As a result, the C-141B was conceived. The A models were sent back to Georgia where they were cut fore and aft of the wing, extended in length by three pallet positions, and refitted for in-flight refueling.\n\nNickel Grass vindicated the Air Force decision to purchase the C-5 Galaxy. Since its introduction in 1970, the C-5 had been plagued by problems. The Air Force claimed to have rectified the problems, but the C-5 was still viewed by the press as an expensive failure. During Nickel Grass, C-5s carried 48% of the total cargo in only 145 of the 567 total missions. The C-5 also carried \"outsize\" cargo such as M60 Patton tanks, M109 howitzers, ground radar systems, mobile tractor units, CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, and A-4 Skyhawk components, cargo that could not fit in smaller aircraft. This performance justified the C-5's existence.\n\nAnother effect of the operation was the near-resignation of then United States chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) General George Brown. Brown was nearly forced to resign after making comments claiming that Israel received U.S. military aid because Jews controlled the American banking system.\n\n\n\n"}

An Adam7 interlaced image is broken into seven subimages, which are defined by replicating this 8×8 pattern across the full image.\n\nThe subimages are then stored in the image file in numerical order.\n\nAdam7 uses seven passes and operates in both dimensions, compared to only four passes in the vertical dimension used by GIF. This means that an approximation of the entire image can be perceived much more quickly in the early passes, particularly if interpolation algorithms such as bicubic interpolation are used.\n\nAdam7 is named after Adam M. Costello, who suggested the method on February 2, 1995, and after the seven steps involved.\n\nIt is a rearrangement of this five-pass scheme that had earlier been proposed by Lee Daniel Crocker:\nAlternative speculative proposals at the time included square spiral interlacing and using Peano curves, but these were rejected as being overcomplicated.\n\nThe pixels included in each pass, and the total pixels encoded at that point are as follows:\n\nWhen rendering, the image will generally be interpolated at earlier stages, rather than just these pixels being rendered.\n\nAdam7 is a multiscale model of the data, similar to a discrete wavelet transform with Haar wavelets, though it starts from an 8×8 block, and downsamples the image, rather than decimating (low-pass filtering, then downsampling). It thus offers worse frequency behavior, showing artifacts (pixelation) at the early stages, in return for simpler implementation.\n\nAdam7 arises from iteration of the following pattern:\nwhich may be interpreted as \"folding\" in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Similarly, GIF interlacing can be seen as iteration of the pattern, but only in the vertical direction ( expands to which is filled in as ).\n\nUsing this 3-pass pattern means the first pass is (1/2) = 1/4 (25%) of the image.\n\nIterating this pattern once yields a 5-pass scheme; after 3 passes this yields\nwhich is then filled in to:\nIn the 5-pass pattern, the first pass (1/4) = 1/16 (6.25%) of the image.\n\nIterating again yields the 7-pass Adam7 scheme, where the first pass (1/8) = 1/64 (1.5625%) of the image.\n\nIn principle this can be iterated, yielding a 9-pass scheme, an 11-pass scheme, and so forth, or alternatively an adaptive number of passes can be used, as many as the image size will allow (so the first pass consists of a single pixel), as is usual in scale-free multiscale modeling. In the context that PNG was developed (i.e., for the image sizes and connection speeds in question), a 7-pass scheme was seen as sufficient, and preferable to a simple 5-pass scheme.\n\n"}

In his long career, he played against ten male and female world champions, beating Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, and Vera Menchik.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was the oldest living grandmaster, and the last surviving person from the original group of grandmasters awarded the title by FIDE in 1950.\n\nLilienthal was born in Moscow, Russian Empire, and moved to Hungary at the age of two. He played for Hungary in three Chess Olympiads: Folkestone 1933 (scoring +7−0=6 as the reserve, the fifth player on the team), Warsaw 1935 (scoring +11−0=8 on second board), and Stockholm 1937 (scoring +9−2=6 on , leading his team to the silver medal). He won the individual gold medal for his board (reserve and second board, respectively) at the 1933 and 1935 Olympiads, and had the fourth-best result on first board in 1937. His total score in the Olympiads was a remarkable 75.51%.\nEmigrating to the Soviet Union in 1935, Lilienthal became a Soviet citizen in 1939. He played in the USSR Chess Championship eight times. His best result came in the 1940 championship, when he tied for first with Igor Bondarevsky, ahead of Smyslov, Paul Keres, Isaac Boleslavsky, Botvinnik, and 14 other players. He qualified for the Candidates Tournament once, in 1948.\n\nFrom 1951 until 1960 he was Tigran Petrosian's trainer. Lilienthal began a friendship with Vasily Smyslov in 1938, and was Smyslov's in his world championship matches against Botvinnik. He retired from tournament play in 1965 and returned to Hungary in 1976. His last tournament was Zamárdi 1980, where he finished sixth in the B group, scoring +3−1=11.\n\nLilienthal remained actively involved in the chess world into his ninth decade. He died on May 8, 2010 at the age of 99; it was reported that he had been ill for some time.\n\nBobby Fischer approved only three chess players who could carry his coffin at his funeral: Andor Lilienthal, Lajos Portisch, and Boris Spassky.\n\nLilienthal was one of the few players with an even record against Capablanca. Lilienthal's \"most celebrated victory\" is his win commanding the white pieces against Capablanca at Hastings 1934–35:\n\nThe game is famed, and Lilienthal relates, \"wherever I went on an exhibition tour, both in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, chess players and fans always asked me to show them how I sacrificed the queen against the great Cuban.\" When Bobby Fischer noticed Lilienthal in the audience at his 1992 return match against Boris Spassky, Fischer greeted him with the remark \"Pawn e5 takes f6.\"\n\n"}

McDonough is founding principal of William McDonough + Partners, co-founder of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry (MBDC) as well as co-author of \"\" and \"The Upcycle: Beyond Sustainability—Designing for Abundance.\" McDonough's career is focused on creating a beneficial footprint. He espouses a message that we can design materials, systems, companies, products, buildings, and communities that continuously improve over time.\n\nMcDonough was born in Tokyo, the son of an American Seagram's executive, and trained at Dartmouth College and Yale University. In 1981 McDonough founded his architectural practice, and his first major commission was the 1984 Environmental Defense Fund Headquarters. The EDF's requirement of good indoor air quality in the structure exposed McDonough to the need for sustainable development.\n\nMcDonough's architecture practice, William McDonough + Partners, operates in Charlottesville, Virginia. McDonough moved his practice from New York City to Charlottesville in 1994 when he was appointed as the Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Virginia. He served as Dean until 1999 and has since served as a professor of business administration and an alumni research professor. He is chief executive of McDonough Innovation, which provides high-level consulting to global companies, organizations and governments and co-founded the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute. He is also co-founder of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry (MBDC), based in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nA number of large corporate projects for The Gap, Nike, and Herman Miller, led to his commission for a 20-year, US$2 billion environmental re-engineering of the Ford Motor Company's legendary River Rouge Plant in Dearborn, Michigan. The project included rolling out the world's largest \"living roof\" in October 2002. The roof of the 1.1 million square foot (100,000 m²) Dearborn truck assembly plant was covered with more than 10 acres (40,000 m²) of sedum, a low-growing ground cover.\n\nIn 1996 McDonough became the first and only individual recipient of the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development. In 1999 \"Time\" called him \"Hero for the Planet\". In 2002 he wrote (with Michael Braungart) \"\". In 2004 he received a National Design Award for environmental design from the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. He is also a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.\n\nMcDonough was also a senior advisor and Venture Partner at VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of the largest venture capital investors in clean technology.\n\nWilliam McDonough and his architecture and urban design firm, William McDonough + Partners, ground their work in Cradle to Cradle Design, a philosophy developed by McDonough and German chemist Dr. Michael Braungart in their 2002 book, \"\". The goal is to frame design as \"a beneficial, regenerative force—one that seeks to create ecological footprints to delight in, not lament.\" The primary goal of Cradle to Cradle Design is to shift thinking from doing \"less bad\" to being \"more good.\" McDonough has also articulated the Cradle to Cradle Design framework as The Five Goods™ (Good Materials, Good Economy, Good Energy, Good Water, Good Lives) to help companies focus and evaluate their efforts on becoming \"more good.\" The Five Goods were also designed to offer a streamlined method of addressing each of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe design of the firm is often categorized as green architecture or sustainable architecture. The concept, closely linked with green building, is not known for a distinctive visual style, but for minimizing the negative environmental impact of a building. McDonough, however, is often quoted as saying the aspiration is to design something like a tree, something that creates good, like oxygen, rather than minimizing negative impact. McDonough's designs use solar and other passive energy efficiency techniques, as illustrated by the William McDonough + Partners' Flow House designed for the Make It Right Foundation New Orleans. The design incorporates deep overhangs, multiple connections with exterior areas allowing for lots of daylight and natural ventilation, roof mounted PV panels, water cisterns to harvest rainwater runoff and rain gardens to absorb any storm runoff.\n\nIn 1984, McDonough and his colleagues designed the Environmental Defense Fund office in New York City. Since then, William McDonough + Partners has been responsible for other milestones in the movement, such as 901 Cherry Ave in San Bruno, California, completed in 1997 for Gap, Inc.; it is now home to Google's YouTube. The building features a green roof that helps to prevent water runoff, insulates the building from noise and provides a habitat for several species, and received the BusinessWeek/Architectural Record Design Award in 1998. The Bernheim Arboretum Visitor Center for the Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, in Clermont, Kentucky, completed in 2005, blurs the line between outdoor and indoor space. This project, like others designed by William McDonough + Partners, draws heavily on the biophilia hypothesis - the study of the human desire and physiological need for contact with nature. The building was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum rating.\n\nTogether with his architecture firm, McDonough developed a master plan for the design of Park 20|20, the first large-scale urban development in the Netherlands that adopts the Cradle to Cradle philosophy.\n\nWilliam McDonough co-founded the Make It Right Foundation New Orleans with Brad Pitt. This is an effort to rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans.\n\nDedicated in 2012, the NASA Ames Research Center's Sustainability Base is designed to harvest more energy than it needs to operate and to cleanse its own water. It was designed to meet a conventional budget and tight timeline, be a test bed for NASA technologies, and it exceeds LEED Platinum metrics. The facility is designed to \"learn\"—and continuously improve—over time.\n\nMcDonough addressed the Arctic Circle China Forum in Shanghai and laid out a framework for how to \"bring back breathing cities\" in May 2019. This system seeks to avoid focusing on releasing less carbon and fewer toxic chemicals into the air and instead shifts to integrating renewable energy such as geothermal as a transformative solution to air pollution and climate change. This vision encourages cities to break out of the urban linear flow of, “take, make, waste,” and embrace a circular flow of \"take, make, retake, remake, restore\" to implement a Circular Carbon Economy.\n\nIn June 2019 William McDonough delivered a keynote address at Sustainable Brands on \"A Bold New Vision for the Collection, Processing, Circularity and Productivity of Plastic Waste\". As a step toward solving the plastics crisis, McDonough directed the audience to \"refuse refuse\", or reject plastics which are not reusable, recyclable, compostable and recoverable.\n\nOn May 20, 2010 at Google Corporate Headquarters, the Googleplex, McDonough announced the launch of the Green Products Innovation Institute, which was later renamed the \"Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute.\" The Institute builds on the 2008 California state law that establishes the nation's first green chemistry program. The non-profit public/private Institute has received the Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program on an exclusive, worldwide basis to accelerate the transition to safe material use and increased material reutilization. Executives from Google, Walmart, YouTube, Shaw Inc. and Herman Miller Inc. joined McDonough for the announcement.\n\nThe Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program is based on five attributes, Material Health, Circular Economy, Renewable Energy, Water Stewardship and Social Fairness. On June 18, 2019, McDonough delivered a plenary at GreenBiz's inaugural Circularity '19 conference, where he spoke about the program encouraging a safe then circular economy to prevent recirculating harmful chemicals, which he refers to as retox.\n\nAt the January 2014 World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland, William McDonough led the first CEO workshop that was centered around sustainable design, with an added focus on Cradle and Cradle, The Upcycle, and the circular economy. Prior to the 2014 meeting, McDonough participated in the organizing process in Geneva, when the WEF partnered with the United Nations to review the issue of climate change. It was later determined that climate change and the circular economy would be the main focus of the 2014 WEF meeting.\n\nMcDonough was appointed as Chair of the Forum's Meta-Council on Circular Economy in July 2014.\n\nIn May 2008, Vanity Fair magazine offered an extensive profile of McDonough, which included a close look at several of his clients and projects, in the piece \"Industrial Revolution, Take Two.\" Similar profiles about McDonough and his work have been published by the San Francisco Chronicle, Discover Magazine, and Time Magazine.\n\nIn 2013, Stanford University Libraries began the William McDonough “Living Archive\".\nStanford University Libraries will also host the William A. McDonough Archive (WAMA). \nThis will be a first of a kind real-time \"Living Archive\".\n\nHe was recognized at the 2017 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland as the recipient of the Fortune Award for Circular Economy Leadership for outstanding contribution to the development of a prosperous and sustainable economy.\n\nMcDonough was named as one of Fortune Magazine's World's 50 Greatest Leaders in 2019 at number 24 in recognition of his contributions to the green building movement, being a leading proponent of the circular economy and his efforts to redesign plastics.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is believed to have been the cousin of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He first engaged in battle at the assault on Miki Castle in Harima Province, and following the battle of Yamazaki, he was granted a 500 \"koku\" stipend.\n\nAt the battle of Shizugatake in 1583, he defeated Haigo Gozaemon, a prominent samurai. Masanori (Tenshō 11) had the honor of taking the first head, namely that of the enemy general Ogasato Ieyoshi, receiving a 5000 \"koku\" increase in his stipend for this distinction (the other six \"Spears\" each received 3000 \"Koku\"), he married with Omasa.\n\nMasanori took part in many of Hideyoshi's campaigns; it was after the Kyūshū Expedition, however, that he was made a \"daimyō\".

Masanori was to once again receive distinction when he took Ch'ongju.\n\nFollowing his involvement in the Korean campaign, Masanori was involved in the pursuit of Toyotomi Hidetsugu. He led 10,000 men in 1595, surrounded Seiganji temple on Mount Kōya, and waited until Hidetsugu had committed suicide.

Released on October 22, 1996, the album marked the reunion of the classic 1980s lineup, which had not recorded together since 1983's \"Frontiers\". \"Trial by Fire\" was produced by Kevin Shirley, who continues to produce the band's albums. The first album to feature bassist Ross Valory since \"Frontiers\" and the last to feature vocalist Steve Perry and drummer Steve Smith.\n\n\"Trial by Fire\" includes the Top 20 hit and Grammy nominated single \"When You Love a Woman\", which reached No. 12 and No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts respectively. \"Message of Love\", \"Can't Tame the Lion\" and \"If He Should Break Your Heart\" were released as singles and received radio airplay.\n\nThe album reflected a growing maturity with the members of Journey and could be loosely termed a concept album with many tracks reflecting a more overt spirituality in lyrical content. The title track, for example, is taken directly from Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians.\n\n\"Trial by Fire\" is Journey's only album to not be accompanied by a supporting tour. That was due to internal disputes over a tour (originally scheduled for the summer and fall of 1997), as a result of Perry's hip injury as he prolonged getting the necessary surgery. If the band had toured, that tour would not have started until over a year after the album's release. Perry left the band feeling that he was being forced out. He was unsure about undergoing necessary surgery and because of pressure to tour sooner than later. Drummer Steve Smith also quit citing that the band without Perry did not interest him; he returned to the group in 2015, but was fired in 2020.\n\nOn November 9, 1996, the album entered at No. 3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was eventually certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA. The band did not receive another platinum award until \"Revelation\" in 2008.\n\n\"Trial by Fire\" was Journey's first studio album in ten years, following \"Raised on Radio\" in 1986 and the band's subsequent split. Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain had formed supergroup Bad English and released albums in 1989 and 1991, while singer Steve Perry released his second solo album, \"For the Love of Strange Medicine\" (1994). While on a solo tour in 1994, it became apparent to Perry that \"underneath it all, I was missing more and more being the singer in Journey than I ever thought I would.\" When A&R executive John Kalodner of Columbia Records suggested the band reform, Cain, Perry, and Schon began writing together. According to Perry, they wanted to \"see if we had the spark to write again\" instead of simply reforming for a comeback tour. \"I was invited – and quickly uninvited,\" recalled Gregg Rolie, who had left in 1980.\n\nPerry said the band did not try to reinvent themselves on the album: \"Nothing sounds more pretentious than someone being something they're not. One of the things we've always known is that there are certain musical directions that fit what [our] chemistry is about. We're going to sink or swim being what we are and not by trying to reinvent ourselves and not by trying to be the flavor of the month.\"\n\nJourney\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n"}
{"id": "1969733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969733", "title": "Brian Wilson (album)", "text": "Brian Wilson (album)\n\nBrian Wilson is the debut studio album by Brian Wilson released in July 1988 on Sire Records. It was voted one of the best albums of 1988 by \"NME\", and as part of its acclaim, garnered the nickname \"\"Pet Sounds '88\"\" among some critics. The album has since been reissued on several formats with bonus tracks, and cited by some as a standout in Wilson's solo oeuvre.\n\nThe album, which cost $1 million to produce, was the first written and produced by Wilson since \"The Beach Boys Love You\" (1977). Working with an array of collaborators including his therapist Eugene Landy, Wilson accordingly themed \"Brian Wilson\" around love and spirituality exemplified by its lead single \"Love and Mercy\". Although the album's sessions were contentious, where some participants demanded a progressive artistic statement versus conventional pop songs, nearly a quarter of the LP is devoted to \"Rio Grande\", a piece which was intended to rekindle Wilson's experimental drive from the mid-1960s and early 1970s.\n\nTwo follow-ups were planned but ultimately discarded: \"Sweet Insanity\" (1991), co-produced with Landy, and an unfinished 1990s album, co-produced with Andy Paley. Wilson would not release a second solo album of new original material until \"Imagination\" (1998).\n\nDuring the 1980s, Wilson was under high-profile around-the-clock medical care by his therapist Eugene Landy after spending several years participating in little-to-no work with the Beach Boys. According to co-founder and cousin Mike Love: \"Neither his [Brian's] brothers nor his mother nor I nor most anyone else could reach him. Landy controlled all access and appeared to control Brian’s career as well. ... Landy claimed that the Beach Boys had prevented Brian from being part of the recording. Actually, we wanted Brian to be part of the group, and the funny thing is, Brian wanted that as well.\" In 1988, Wilson said: \"Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked [my brother] Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten.\"\n\nStarting in 1983, Wilson made infrequent trips to recording studios, amassing a hefty amount of songwriting collaborations between him, Landy, and childhood friend Gary Usher, and only exerting marginal involvement with the Beach Boys' 1985 eponymous album, making it unforeseeable for some time that Wilson would ever work as a seriously productive musician or composer again. The initial single released that April, \"Let's Go To Heaven In My Car\", was co-written with Usher, and was included in the soundtrack for \"Police Academy 4\", although it flopped. Despite all odds, Wilson was signed to a multi-album solo recording contract with Sire Records in early 1987 after label president Seymour Stein saw Wilson perform an a cappella version of \"On Broadway\" while inducting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Los Angeles record producer Lenny Waronker recounts,\n\nStein imposed one condition on Wilson for the recording of his approaching solo album: that he would be allowed to appoint his own co-producer to help him stay organized and on-task. The condition was agreed upon, and Stein called up multi-instrumentalist record producer Andy Paley, a devout Brian Wilson fan who had previously gained some success and notoriety producing artists ranging from Madonna to Jonathan Richman. Wilson ordered two conditions of his own: that Landy would be appointed executive producer and business manager, and that he would be allowed to work at his own pace. Wilson proceeded to record a full album composed largely of new material while working mainly with Andy Paley, Eugene Landy & wife Alexandra Morgan, and a few other guest musicians.\n\nWilson's material on the album was gathered from the previous five years of songwriting, which amounted to about a hundred songs. According to Paley, \"My job was to kick him in the ass and get him going… It was difficult because he was medicated, and that slowed him down a bit. He was also in mid-career and didn’t have anything to prove anymore.\" Similar to Wilson's previous collaborators Tony Asher or Van Dyke Parks, some of the tracks' rough outlines sprang largely out of conversations about whatever was on their mind at the time. On the lyrics, Wilson said \"I like to write for young people, ‘cause they understand what I’m saying in my music, understand where I’m coming from. But, I think this album should appeal to people in their twenties, thirties and forties. ... I write more about ideas, now. Before, I wrote about tangible kinds of things; now, I’m writing about ideas, love songs again. I’m back to love songs: 'Melt Away' and 'Love and Mercy' and 'One for the Boys' and 'There’s So Many'. There are four or five love songs on the album.\"\n\nThe recording sessions, mainly supervised by veteran producers like Russ Titelman and Lenny Waronker, were said to be contentious. Wilson's collaborators reportedly clashed with Landy and his medical staff. As Paley expounds: \"The guy was saying something like, 'Brian, don’t you think the lyrics would be better if Alexandra fixed them?' And Brian said, 'No, I like them the way they are.' Then the guy’s like, 'Well, what did you tell me last night when I said you could have that milkshake if you switched the lyrics?' And then Brian said, 'Oh, okay. The new lyrics are better than the old ones.'\" Landy made repeated attempts to modify lyrics and arrangements by interrupting sessions, sometimes confiscating master tapes to assert his control. According to Paley \"Anything good we got out of those sessions was done totally on stolen time… Landy was always checking in, phoning in directions, basically never wanting to give Brian any breathing room. It was a hassle and many times heartbreaking because we’d do something good, finally, and then Landy would swoop in and dive-bomb it.\"\n\nTitelman, who had previously collaborated with Wilson in the 1960s on the songs \"Guess I'm Dumb\" and \"Sherry She Needs Me\", was brought on board after Wilson reportedly expressed desire to make the record more modern. Titelman says, \"My job was to egg him on, make him do stuff that maybe he wouldn't have done, hope we shared the same taste. In that way, I was helpful, a catalyst. ... I was sensitive to Brian’s quirkiness and to his feelings about certain things, but after a point, he knows what’s good and he knows what to do. And I know what to do. We’re both professionals. So if he was going off track, I would say 'This is no good.' I was very tough about what I thought, made no bones.\" Landy praised Titelman's impact on the work, explaining \"[Titelman] brought [Wilson] from four track to forty-eight track\". Waronker remembers, \"Russ did a real good job of helping Brian realize the beauty of his music, helped it stand up. Brian hasn't done this in a long time, and he needed help with the technology. And where it needed some small fixing, Russ was able to show Brian how to do it in a simple way. ... The idea that Brian was able to do this after so much time away was really shocking, beyond what anybody could expect.\" Waronker believed that the final product continued the efforts started by \"Pet Sounds\", resembling an updated version of the album.\n\nIn 1997, Andy Paley looked back on \"Brian Wilson\" as \"a pretty good record, but it wasn't as good as it could have been because there were too many cooks, and Brian wasn't really calling the shots.\" He expanded upon his comments to say \"there were a lot of people helping on the record ... These people aren't bad people. ... and if anyone tried to force anything out of me or Brian, it would have been a failure.\" Paley added that the album's production, writing, and musician credits were all published inaccurately, and that he had written the middle part of \"One for the Boys\", but was uncredited.\n\n\"Love and Mercy\", according to Wilson, was written as \"a personal message from me to people ... because there’s no guarantee of somebody waking up in the morning with any love.\" \"Walkin' the Line\" was co-written with Nick Laird-Clowes of dream pop band the Dream Academy. \"Let it Shine\" was co-written with Jeff Lynne of symphonic rock group Electric Light Orchestra, another devout Wilson fan who had just finished producing George Harrison's album \"Cloud Nine\" (1987). In 2015, Lynne intimated: \n\nCertain portions and ideas of \"Brian Wilson\" harken back to Wilson's earlier work with the Beach Boys. The song \"Baby Let Your Hair Grow Long\" is a spiritual sequel to \"Caroline, No\", as Wilson explained: \"It is, of course, a sexual song, a song about sexual ideas. At first, when I wrote the melody, I thought maybe it should be a love song. ... Most of the lyrics were romantic, but then I put in a couple of sexual lines. And then I said, 'Wait a minute. Let’s get rid of some of the love aspects, the romantic aspects of this song, and put in more sexual lyrics' ... It’s like when girls whack their hair off short, and they don’t give a shit. Sometimes, if you prompt a girl, prompt someone to hit the road and get on the stick and let your hair grow long and try harder. ... [Hair] exemplifies beauty in a girl.\"\n\nAt the behest of Titelman, the album's eight-minute-long closing suite, \"Rio Grande\" was purposely developed as a continuation to the modular recording experiments Wilson had begun with tracks such as \"Good Vibrations\" and \"Cool, Cool Water\", and bears traits similar to Wilson's aborted \"Smile\" project. The song tells a story of a man running away to find his home, which Wilson believes, \"That's symbolism right? God cannot be conceived of, so therefore we give him a literal meaning, and he's in the sky so that people can understand what is being said.\"\n\nAt times when Landy wasn't around, Wilson was reported to have worked with \"amazing speed and precision, often dreaming up and singing complex, multipart vocal arrangements while standing alone at the microphone\". Vocal sessions were strenuous on Wilson, and he was assigned a vocal coach during sessions. Comparing with the new recording technology, Wilson commented, \"It makes it faster, speeds up the process a little bit. We did this album differently than I used to. I used to get a group of people out there in the studio and produce the band live. Now, everything’s done on synthesizers. I played most of the album, but now and then, we’d call in musicians for specific parts. ... There are a lot of reasons I like working with emulators rather than live musicians.\" Michael Bernard who was employed as a synthesizer programmer explained his perspective,\n\nMost of the album was recorded by Christmas 1987. After several months of mixing, \"Brian Wilson\" was assembled in April 1988 and ready for release.\n\nTwo singles from the album, \"Love and Mercy\" (#40 Mainstream Rock) and \"Melt Away,\" sold poorly. They were backed with \"He Couldn't Get His Poor Old Body to Move\" and \"Being With the One You Love\", both tracks which were not included on the album. A third, \"Night Time,\" was released for promotional use only. Although the Beach Boys' #1 hit \"Kokomo\" may have stolen some of the album's attention, Wilson's restricted promotion of the album, which was overseen and controlled by his controversial psychologist Eugene Landy, was more likely the reason for the limited sales. Initially, Landy and his girlfriend, Alexandra Morgan, even had their names included on some of the songs on \"Brian Wilson\", but once he was successfully removed from Wilson's life in 1991, the credits were later revised to reflect their lack of involvement in Wilson's songs.\n\nA music video was produced for the lead single \"Love and Mercy\" featuring Brian and engineer/producer Mark Linnett in the studio. The clip was not frequently broadcast, possibly because of the failure of the single to make any impact on the top 40 charts. However, Sire Records did release a promotional disc with an interview of Brian Wilson intertwined with various tracks from the album. Additionally, Sire released a limited edition CD with a leather-bound jacket.\n\n\"Brian Wilson\" was released in July 1988 to favorable reviews, and reached number 54 on American record charts. Its completion came as a shock to many. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin would later note that, upon release, \"[the album] succeeded at giving Brian Wilson the forward-looking perspective of a legitimate comeback. Brian had finally delivered on his oft-given promise to 'really stretch out and blow some minds' with his sheer ambition. When the needle finally lifted at the end of side two, it was easy to imagine that he really might be back on his journey to the distant frontier.\"\n\nIn contemporary reviews, \"Stereo Review\" said the album would likely appease those whose expectations were \"\"Pet Sounds II\"\", writing \"Yes, it's true. Brian Wilson's back ... [and he's] clearly at work again with talent intact\". David Fricke wrote for \"Rolling Stone\": \"\"Brian Wilson\" is a stunning reminder of what pop's been missing all these years. It is also the best Beach Boys long player since 1970's \"Sunflower\", although Wilson is the only Beach Boy on it. The songs are full of sunshine choirboy harmonies and sing-along hooks, while the rich, expansive arrangements echo the orchestral radiance of Wilson's spiritual mentor, Phil Spector.\" \"Sun-Sentinel\" reviewed: \"Wilson's clever, mostly upbeat ideas flow magnificently throughout the record, easily transcending his emotional madness. His introspective poems and barbershop harmonies are framed in a series of bouncy melodies that never take a trite or simple path. ... Just when you think you know where one of his songs may lead, he dips into another spacey progression, and the tune is launched again on a separate plane. In particular, the closing six-part piece, 'Rio Grande', is the kind of immensely fulfilling progressive pop with which art-rock bands such as Yes and Genesis formerly toyed, but rarely brought to satisfying completion.\"\n\nReflecting on the album's release years later, Richie Unterberger referred to the album's use of the Yamaha DX7 digital synthesizer as a detracting element, elaborating, \"While he retained his gift for catchy melodies and dense, symphonic production, there was a forced stiffness to both the songwriting and execution. Much of the blame for the album's mixed success can be laid upon its sterile, synthesizer-laden arrangements and echoing percussion, which epitomized some of the less attractive aspects of late-1980s production.\"\n\nHirokazu Tanaka and Keiichi Suzuki, the composers for the Japanese role-playing video game series \"EarthBound\", cited \"Brian Wilson\" and related work as major influences on the games' soundtracks.\n\nIn 2000, Sire re-released the album through Rhino/Atlantic Records with non-album single tracks, non-album b-sides, demos, instrumentals, and interview clips. On its 25th anniversary in 2013, Friday Music Records reissued the album on blue 180g vinyl.

Her productions include 1975's \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", and \"Gallipoli\", which received an AFI Award in 1982 as Best Film. \n\nPatricia Anna Parr says she was born in either Artarmon or Willoughby, the second child, and first daughter, of Leticia Evelyn née Forsythe and Harold George Parr. During her childhood three of her siblings died, including one who was quite ill at birth and died at 18 months, and her parents divorced. She attended Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale, but \"didn't do well in the Leaving at all\" and failed to get a university pass.\n\nShe began her career in radio at the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) in the early 1950s, becoming a junior broadcaster in children's programs. That led to her joining the cast of the \"Argonauts Club\". Despite the pressure of live television and having no formal training, she started making weekly appearances on ABC Children's TV, and in 1960 began her most fondly-remembered role as 'Miss Pat' in ABC TV's children's television program \"Mr. Squiggle\". \n\nIn 1964 Lovell became what she characterised as \"one of the minor beauties\" on the panel of \"Beauty and the Beast\". When \"The Today Show\" began in 1969 (which pre-dated the current show by over a decade), she joined the team, and it was there as an interviewer that she met Peter Weir, the director with whom she would produce her two best-known films, \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\" and \"Gallipoli\". For a time she ran a film co-production company with Mel Gibson.\n\nLovell worked as Head of Producing at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS) between 1996 and 2003.\n\nLovell met her husband, actor Nigel Tasman Lovell (1916-2001), through the Metropolitan Theatre in Sydney. He was a widower with a daughter.

It deals with the history of non-Muslim populations during and after the conquest of their lands by Muslims.\n\nThe book contains 17 chapters by Bat Ye'or, as well as essays by Ibn Warraq, Walid Phares, David Littman, Patrick Sookhdeo, and Mark Durie. The writers opine that attitudes of Muslims today are informed by the tenets of Islam. It covers topics including sharia law and antisemitism.\n\nA November 2004 review of the book in \"Publishers Weekly\" said the book's theme \"merits exploration\", but that the book does not explain why Islam is \"inherently intolerant\". An August 2005 review of the book in \"Asia Times\" opined that:\n\n... \"The Myth of Islamic Tolerance\" warrants our attention. Any study of contemporary Islam would be incomplete without it. Collectively, the essays expose an unsettling fact: that Islam's famed tolerance of non-Muslims has over the centuries fallen well short of an embrace ... However, the book is full of flagrant distortions and glaring omissions.\n\nThe book was reviewed in the September 2005 issue of \"The Middle East Journal\". A review in the June 2006 issue of \"First Things\" said that the book \"might be described as an extended bill of indictment against Islam and a debunking of the still commonly heard claim that Islam has been and is tolerant of minorities.\"\n\nWriting in \"National Review\" in March 2007, Dinesh D'Souza described \"The Myth of Islamic Tolerance\" as being attractive to those who would like to criticize Muslims at large for 9/11. He suggested that the book uses a strategy of selective quotations from the Koran, which he calls \"history for dummies\".\n\nDr. Akbar Ahmed, professor of Islamic studies at American University, described the book as an example of one of the most humane religions in the world being misrepresented as a violent one. In his book \"Beyond the Veneer\", Ioannis Gatsiounis says that the book \"struggles to find an enlightened balance\", as it sometimes overlooks complexities while at the same time avoiding a trend in many circles of viewing the issue it addresses solely as a non-religious one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1969765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969765", "title": "Micallef Tonight", "text": "Micallef Tonight\n\nMicallef Tonight was a short-lived Aria Award–winning Australian variety show that aired on the Nine Network in 2003. It was hosted by comedian Shaun Micallef and also featured the talents of Francis Greenslade, Jason Geary, Livinia Nixon and Pete Smith.\n\nMuch like a typical variety show, each episode of \"Micallef Tonight\" featured a number of interviews with celebrities bookended by regular segments (such as \"Shaun on his High Horse\", which featured Micallef ranting against pop culture while straddling a gymnast vaulting horse) and a musical performance. However at times the show also delved into the realm of parody, such as introducing guest Jamie Durie with a long-winded opening only to dismiss him immediately afterwards since there was nothing left to discuss, and requesting that guest Alison Whyte hold an inflatable fish while Micallef himself danced on his desk, in an otherwise unrelated interview.\n\nOther in-show shenanigans included stealing musical guest Delta Goodrem's shoes as she played the piano, deliberately leaving actress Melissa George, live via satellite from Hollywood, on hold for over five minutes (she had guest starred in a supersized episode of \"Friends\" earlier that night, effectively delaying the broadcast of \"Micallef Tonight\" by several minutes), and requesting singers insert random words in to their musical performances to prove they weren't lip-synching. Notable examples were David Campbell inserting the word \"lamington\" into his performance and Amiel inserting the word \"dolphinarium\".\n\nMicallef would end each episode with the line \"See you in the Monkey House Australia!\" and the show would usually close with a musical performance from Greenslade that was never quite what the audience expected; such as a rendition of Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" played on the guitar.\n\nMicallef previously parodied the variety show format with 1998's \"The Micallef Program\".\n\nThe series premiered on 12 May 2003 and thirteen episodes were aired. The first episode rated strongly and although ratings declined steadily thereafter, it was announced in June 2003 that the series would be extended for a further 20 weeks.\n\nEpisode 12 (28 July) included a segment involving a midget hassling random restaurant patrons; after it screened, guest Tony Martin pointed out that the last show he had been involved in which featured the same midget actor -- (\"The Mick Molloy Show\") -- had been axed. In an example of history repeating itself, Micallef Tonight was cancelled the following week. In addition, on an earlier episode during a live cross to promote the movie \"Bad Eggs\", a visibly intoxicated Mick Molloy warned Micallef to \"watch (his) arse\" when he learned that the show was on the Nine Network.\n\nMicallef ended his series with an interview with Ricky Martin in which both he and Martin used an expletive on live television, then called channel Nine live on air to complain about the language used on his show. Ironically, the interview was pre-recorded in the previous week to fit in with Martin's schedule, a fact alluded to by both Micallef and comedian Dave O'Neil during the actual live segments of the episode.\n\nAt the conclusion of what ended up being the final show, Micallef said that band The Dandy Warhols would be on the next week’s show. The camera cut to the band on stage, ready to perform. Micallef informed the band that it was the next week they were meant to be on.\n\nSimilarly to the equally short-lived \"The Mick Molloy Show\" (also shown on Nine), \"Micallef Tonight\" was ostensibly cancelled because of dwindling ratings, in this case against fellow comedian Andrew Denton's interview series \"Enough Rope\". In a memorable parody, whilst Dannii Minogue was performing on Shaun's show, the camera cut to him only to see Shaun watching Andrew Denton's show (which aired simultaneously on another channel).\n\nCritics also claimed that the show may have been too sophisticated for most audiences on the notoriously \"mainstream\" Nine Network, and was an acquired taste. Others have said that part of the axing was due to a segment which made fun of Alan Jones' morning message segment on the Australian Today show. The segment began with one video on screen then became two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, and so on until it reached dozens and although nothing said was comprehensible, they all ended at the same time with 'I'm Alan Jones'. This segment apparently angered Channel Nine owner Kerry Packer (who was also a close friend of Jones), and he ordered the show to be axed after less-than-impressive ratings for what turned out to be the final episode.\n\nAt the time of its airing, the show was critically acclaimed and became a cult favorite, even having followers internationally due to its irreverent humor and absurdity.\n\nThe \"Micallef Tonight\" show was released on DVD as a \"best of\" compilation, that included some un-aired material.\n\"The Expurgated Micallef Tonight: The Very Best of Shaun Micallef's Short-Lived but Brilliant Tonight Show\" was released through Shock on 26 November 2007. On 19 October 2008 the DVD release won an ARIA Award for best comedy release.\nThe DVD included a commentary track on part of the contents, featuring Micallef and guest Tony Martin (who appeared in episode 12 and also in the un-aired pilot).\n\nThe DVD is also available as part of the DVD box set \"The Collected Shaun Micallef\" which was released in 2011 by Shock Records. The set features 10 discs, containing \"The Expurgated Micallef Tonight\", \"The Incompleat Shaun Micallef\" (highlights of his work on \"Full Frontal\") and all three seasons of \"The Micallef Program\" as well as a bonus audio CD \"His Generation\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969794", "title": "Upper memory area", "text": "Upper memory area\n\nIn DOS memory management, the upper memory area (UMA) refers to memory between the addresses of 640 KB and 1024 KB (0xA0000–0xFFFFF) in an IBM PC or compatible. IBM reserved the uppermost 384 KB of the 8088 CPU's 1024 KB address space for ROM, RAM on peripherals, and memory-mapped input/output. For example, the monochrome video memory area runs from 704 to 736 KB (0xB0000–B7FFF).\n\nHowever, even with video RAM, the ROM BIOS and I/O ports for expansion cards, much of this 384 KB of address space was unused. As the 640 KB memory restriction became ever more of an obstacle, techniques were found to fill the empty areas with RAM. These areas were referred to as upper memory blocks (UMBs).\n\nThe next stage in the evolution of DOS was for the operating system to use upper memory blocks (UMBs) and the high memory area (HMA). This occurred with the release of DR DOS 5.0 in 1990. DR DOS' built-in memory manager, EMM386.EXE, could perform most of the basic functionality of QEMM and comparable programs.\n\nThe advantage of DR DOS 5.0 over the combination of an older DOS plus QEMM was that the DR DOS kernel itself and almost all of its data structures could be loaded into high memory. This left virtually \"all\" the base memory free, allowing configurations with up to 620 KB out of 640 KB free.\n\nConfiguration was not automatic - free UMBs had to be identified by hand, manually included in the line that loaded EMM386 from CONFIG.SYS, and then drivers and so on had to be manually loaded into UMBs from CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. This configuration was not a trivial process. As it was largely automated by the installation program of QEMM, this program survived on the market; indeed, it worked well with DR DOS' own HMA and UMB support and went on to be one of the best-selling utilities for the PC.\n\nThis functionality was copied by Microsoft with the release of MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991. Eventually, even more DOS data structures were moved out of conventional memory, allowing up to 631 KB out of 640 KB to be left free. Starting from version 6.0 of MS-DOS, Microsoft even included a program called MEMMAKER which was used to automatically optimize conventional memory by moving TSR programs to the upper memory.\n\nFor a period in the early 1990s, manual optimization of the DOS memory map became a highly prized skill, allowing for the largest applications to run on even the most complex PC configurations. The technique was to first create as many UMBs as possible, including remapping allocated but unused blocks of memory, such as the monochrome display area on colour machines. Then, DOS' many subcomponents had to be loaded into these UMBs in the correct sequence to use the blocks of memory as efficiently as possible. Some TSR programs required additional memory while loading, which was freed up again once loading was complete. Fortunately, there were few dependencies amongst these modules, so it was possible to load them in almost any sequence. Exceptions were that to successfully cache CD-ROMs, most disk caches had to be loaded after any CD-ROM drivers, and that the modules of most network stacks had to be loaded in a certain sequence, essentially working progressively up through the layers of the OSI model.\n\nA basic yet effective method used to optimize conventional memory was to load HIMEM.SYS as a device, thereafter loading EMM386.EXE as a device with the \"RAM AUTO\" option which allows access into the UMA by loading device drivers as devicehigh. This method effectively loads the fundamental memory managers into conventional memory, and thereafter everything else into the UMA. Conventional memory glutton programs such as MSCDEX could also be loaded into the UMA in a similar fashion, hence freeing up a large amount of conventional memory.\n\nThe increasing popularity of Windows 3.0 made the necessity of the upper memory area less relevant, as Windows applications were not directly affected by DOS' base memory limits, but DOS programs running under Windows (with Windows itself acting as a multitasking manager) were still thus constrained. With the release of Windows 95, it became less relevant still, as this version of Windows provides much of the functionality of the DOS device drivers to DOS applications running under Windows, such as CD, network and sound support; the memory map of Windows 95 DOS boxes was automatically optimised. However, not all DOS programs could execute in this environment. Specifically, programs that tried to directly switch from real mode to protected mode would not work as this was not allowed in the virtual 8086 mode it was running in. This point is now being addressed by x86 virtualization technologies such as Intel VT-x (Vanderpool) and AMD-V (Pacifica). Also, programs that tried making the switch using the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) API (which was introduced to allow DOS programs that needed protected mode to enter it from the virtual 8086 mode set up by a memory manager, as described above) didn't work in Windows 95. Only the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) API for switching to protected mode was supported.\n\nUpper memory blocks can be created by mapping extended memory into the upper memory area when running in virtual x86 mode. This is similar to how expanded memory can be emulated using extended memory so this method of providing upper memory blocks is usually provided by the expanded memory manager (for example EMM386). The application programming interface for managing the upper memory blocks is specified in the \"eXtended Memory Specification\".\n\nOn many systems including modern ones it is possible to use memory reserved for shadowing expansion card ROM as upper memory. Many chipsets reserve up to 384 KB RAM for this purpose and since this RAM is generally unused it may be used as real mode upper memory with a custom device driver, such as UMBPCI.\n\nOn IBM XT computers, it was possible to add more memory to the motherboard and use a custom address decoder PROM to make it appear in the upper memory area. As with the 386-based upper memory described above, the extra RAM could be used to load TSR files, or as a RAM disk.\n\nThe AllCard, an add-on memory management unit for XT-class computers, allowed normal memory to be mapped into the 0xA0000-EFFFF address range, giving up to 952 KB for DOS programs. Programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, which accessed video memory directly, needed to be patched to handle this memory layout. Therefore, the 640 KB barrier was removed at the cost of software compatibility. This usage of the upper memory area is different from using upper memory blocks, which was used to free conventional memory by moving device drivers and TSRs into the upper 384 KB of the 1 MB address space, but left the amount of addressable memory (640 KB) intact.\n\n"}

It opened in 1903, operating out of the Holy Trinity Church. Trinity is a founding member of the Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria (AGSV). The school has over 1500 students and approximately 20 boarding students.\n\nTrinity Grammar School, Kew was founded by members of the Holy Trinity parish in 1902 and opened the next year. The school originally opened in the parish hall of Holy Trinity Church with 23 boys. Edward Taffs was the first headmaster, although G. M. Long soon succeeded him.\n\nIn 1906, the school purchased a property, \"Roxeth\" (now Henty House), a small distance to the south of the church, on the corner of Wellington Street and Charles Street. Trinity quickly built Arnold Hall, the first classroom block, completing it the next year. In the same year, Trinity was registered as a public school of the Church of England. The school leased \"Molina\", a property on the other side of Charles Street and the site of the former Kew High School which is now further to the north, in 1908. In 1909, the school built a science laboratory beside Arnold Hall.\n\nTwo years later, Long left the school to become Bishop of Bathurst and A. W. Tonge was appointed headmaster. A second classroom building was built, now demolished to make way for the Richard and Elizabeth Tudor Centre for Contemporary Learning. In 1917, Trinity again appointed a new headmaster, Frank Shann, who would lead the school for the next two and a half decades. Under his tenure, the school grew to a total of 245 boys and many buildings were built, including the now demolished War Memorial Library, the junior school classroom building and the \"Health Pavilion\". \"Molina\" was bought from its owner, John Henning, as well as the neighbouring property, \"Elsinore\". The properties were subsequently renamed in 1925, \"Molina\" becoming Merritt House, \"Elsinore\" Roberts House and \"Roxeth\" Henty House. Frank Shann died in 1943.\n\nAlfred Bright became headmaster upon Frank Shann's death. The school built a second storey for the Junior School in 1952, and in the following year, the Parents' and Friends' Hall, a multipurpose venue, was built between Merritt House and Xavier College. On Alfred Bright's retirement, John Leppitt was appointed Headmaster. The school advanced greatly during his time as headmaster, the number of students reaching 812. The Robertson Science and Administration Building was opened in 1959 and extended later on, and two years later, the junior school building was extended to almost meet Roberts House, providing art and music facilities. In 1968, the Shann Building was constructed between the Robertson Building and the old Arnold Hall, as well as a major sports facility, Cornell Gymnasium.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, Trinity purchased land beside Lake Eppalock, near Bendigo, opening the Leppitt Outdoor Education Centre in 1973, named after the headmaster. In 1975, the boarding house, which had been run in Merritt House, closed after more than 60 years. The War Memorial Library was demolished in favour of a new classroom building, the three storey Tonge Building, and the library relocated to one floor of the Shann Building. Several years later, in 1979, John Leppitt retired. The new headmaster, Don Marles, continued the development of the school with a new swimming pool in 1980 and the renovation and renaming to the Bright Laboratories of the original science laboratories housed in the Shann Building. Merritt House, the former boarding house, was converted into a music school.\n\nAs a result of new buildings constructed over the previous two decades, the school sought further land for outdoor sports facilities. Trinity purchased land in Bulleen, near the Yarra River, and opened the Marles Playing Fields there. These facilities continue to be used today on a regular basis.\n\n1989 saw the building of another classroom building, the now demolished Poynter Building. The tuckshop, the original canteen, was closed in 1990, and the cafeteria opened on the ground floor of the Shann Building. Two years later, the school finally built a dedicated chapel for weekly services (previously, students had to attend services at Holy Trinity Church, where the school began). Don Marles retired the same year, replaced by Peter Crawley.\n\nThe school was interested in the development of curriculum and saw the possibilities being opened up in business and industry by the use of computer technology. Nearby MLC had recently introduced Laptop Computers for the personal use by the students as an everyday part of their learning. Trinity, under the leadership of the new headmaster, Peter Crawley, decided to introduce a similar program at Trinity from the start of 1994. However, the new program did not use the computers in the same way as had been the MLC experience. Trinity decided to use a business model and became the first school in the world to adopt the use of Microsoft Office within an educational setting. This attracted the attention of Microsoft in the US and they sent a film crew to the school to record the way the school was using the Laptops. In 1995 the headmaster received a letter from Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft, commending him for his influence on American educators in the area of the use of technology in education.\n\nIn 1993, Trinity and nearby sister school Ruyton Girls' School introduced the Coordinate Program, whereby co-educational classes for Years 11 and 12 are conducted across the two schools. In 1996, the school purchased the Kew Municipal Offices, after the City of Kew was amalgamated into the City of Boroondara, in order to further expand its facilities. Two years later, it opened as the Peter Crawley Centre for the Arts. Peter Crawley then resigned in the same year as he accepted the position as headmaster of Knox Grammar School in Sydney. In 1999, Richard Tudor (former deputy headmaster of Melbourne Grammar School) was appointed as headmaster and the co-educational Early Learning Centre was opened.\n\nIn 2000, the school began using wireless technology for their computers and, in the following year, Trinity began the construction of the Science and Technology Building to replace the Bright Laboratories. This opened in 2003, the year in which Trinity celebrated its centenary year.\n\nThe school opened a new gymnasium, the Peter McIntyre Sports Centre, to complement the old Cornell Sports Gym, and another block of forested land was purchased at Licola, to complement the Outdoor Education Centre at Lake Eppalock. The school also purchased the Stillwell Showroom in 2005, on the corner of Charles Street and Cotham Road, which is currently used as a multipurpose venue, with impending development of the site in the future.\n\nIn recent years, the school was given money to further extend and renovate the old Kew Municipal Offices. This included a junior school hall (named the South Room) and a new facade to the building. This, as nearly all new buildings, was designed by old student Peter McIntyre. The building still has heritage features with some doors saying \"Kew Town Hall\" and \"City of Kew\".\n\nIn 2011, the Poynter Building was demolished to make room for the Richard and Elizabeth Tudor Centre for Contemporary Learning. The building was opened in March 2013 by The Hon. Alex Chernov, the Governor of Victoria. It contains a multi-level library, a cafe and the Year 12 area. It crosses a basement, ground level with a mezzanine and an upper level.\n\nTrinity has developed a reputation as a high-achieving school in the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) and is known for a well-balanced approach to single-sex education. In 2014, Michael Davies (former deputy headmaster of St Kevin's College) took the position of headmaster, succeeding the highly regarded Richard Tudor.\n\nTowards the end of 2015 the school undertook the demolition of Arnold Hall (to be replaced by the Centre for Business & Social Enterprise). The new building was opened in March 2017 by The Hon. Josh Frydenberg, Federal Member for Kooyong, and includes eight classrooms as well as a lecture hall. In 2017, the Junior School introduced the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP). The school also introduced Cambridge University's International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) in Years 9 and 10 English.\n\nIn November 2017, Old Trinity Grammarians' Association president David Baumgartner wrote to the school's leadership, accusing it of being too preoccupied with academic results, fundraising and building projects under Michael Davies' leadership. Baumgartner said the school needed to return to its focus on the \"holistic development\" and wellbeing of students. He said that there was a \"resurgent undercurrent of frustration and anger\" among the school community. It was revealed in 2018 that 152 staff had left the school since Davies became headmaster.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of deputy headmaster Rohan Brown in March 2018, many members of the school community – including current and past students, parents and teachers – expressed extreme discontentment with the direction Michael Davies and the School Council were taking the school and demanded changes be made to the way the school operates, including the dismissal of Davies and the council. There were several large-scale protests from students regarding the dismissal of Rohan Brown. Brown was reinstated on the 11th of April before the commencement of Term 2 after the school's independent review showed that he was unjustly removed from his role despite breaching the school's code of conduct.\n\nMichael Davies announced his resignation on 15 May 2018, effective from the end of Term 2. The School Council announced that Phil De Young, former principal of Carey Baptist Grammar School, would be appointed interim headmaster whilst a search for a new headmaster took place. Almost the entirety of the School Council was replaced following the events of Terms 1 and 2. De Young and the new School Council led a process of community consultation and reconciliation to restore the school to a state of harmony. De Young said in a speech early on: \"Clearly, it's been a tough six months for the school, but that's all behind us. Let's move forward; let's do so with confidence, with passion, and let's do so in a positive way.\" In March 2019, Trinity announced that Adrian Farrer, principal of Cathedral College Wangaratta, would commence in 2020 as the school's 12th headmaster.\n\nTrinity is known for its extensive co-curricular program.\nA significant part of school life is the house system. Each house is named after a notable contributor to Trinity.\nAbout the House Patrons:\n\n\nTrinity is highly regarded for its extensive outreach, social justice and community service programs on a local, national and international level. The program has three main ministries: East Africa, Indigenous Australians and local ministry. Activities include immersion trips to Africa and Outback Australia, working with community organisations focused on mental illness, and a variety of fundraising events for numerous causes.\n\nThe Outdoor Education program includes participation in bushwalking, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, cycling, first aid, navigation, cooking and rafting. The program is compulsory for students from Year 7 to Year 10. Camps are based around school properties at Lake Eppalock, Lake Nillahcootie and Licola. Trinity also offers The Duke of Edinburgh's Award.\n\nTrinity Grammar School, Kew has five campuses across Victoria. These include:\n\n\nThe Old Trinity Grammarians' Association (OTGA) was formed in 1909 and continues to remain a notable alumni community.\n\nThe aims of the OTGA are:\n\nOne of the most popular network of communication for old boys is through the OTG sporting clubs. Currently, the following sporting clubs exist:\n\nTrinity has become known for its work in the area of Indigenous Reconciliation as a result of the work of former headmaster Richard Tudor and former Senior Chaplain Chris Leadbeater. The school has an Indigenous scholarship program that has seen large numbers of Indigenous students progress through the senior school. Senior school trips to the Maree-Arabunna area in South Australia take place each year, on which students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the culture of the region and explore the Outback.\n\nIn 2007, the Federal Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough, made a special visit to Trinity to talk to the school outreach group about their work. Trinity also received the 'Dare to Lead' award in recognition of the school's work in advancing Indigenous issues within the community.\n\nIn 2018, Trinity opened Dadirri House on Wellington Street, a boarding house for Indigenous students who come to the school in Year 8, before moving across to the main boarding house in Year 10. Trinity is a partner school of the Melbourne Indigenous Transition School (MITS), founded by former Headmaster Richard Tudor and his wife Elizabeth.\n\nIn 2016, Mark Watson, a former employee of the school whose work involved caring for boarding school students, was committed to stand trial over 41 historical sex offences against five boys. The abuse is alleged to have taken place between 1975 and 1978, and is the present subject of a compensation claim.\n\nIn January 2017, the school was again brought to prominence over allegations that senior members of the school community – including Headmaster Michael Davies – knew of abuse allegations against former teacher Christopher Howell when it sent a tribute letter praising Howell's \"extraordinary legacy\" to the school after his death in 2016. This action, which was described as \"stupid and insensitive\" by lawyers representing Howell's victims, attracted a great deal of controversy to the school.\n\nIn November 2017, Old Trinity Grammarians' Association president David Baumgartner wrote to the school's leadership, accusing it of being too preoccupied with high ATARs, fundraising and building projects under Michael Davies' leadership. Baumgartner said the school needed to return to its focus on the \"holistic development\" and wellbeing of students. He said that there was a \"resurgent undercurrent of frustration and anger\" among the school community. \"There is too much inward focus on things like buildings, fundraising, marketing, ATAR excellence, Cambridge schooling program, etc,\" Baumgartner wrote in his open letter which made its way to hundreds of parents' inboxes. He said he was also disappointed by the school's treatment of many respected and revered teachers. \"The constant change of staff and the disrespectful way in which it occurs seriously concerns me,\" he said (it was revealed in 2018 that 152 staff had left the school since Davies became headmaster). Baumgartner, who is also a former parent at the school, warned that the school should not be run like a business and suggested that its culture would start to break down.\n\nIn March 2018, the school council sacked deputy headmaster Rohan Brown following a disciplinary issue which the council felt was \"in contravention of school policy and was also inconsistent with community expectations in this day and age\". \"The Age\" revealed that the dismissal was a result of Brown cutting a student's hair on school photo day as the hair did not meet the school's appearance policy. Some members of the school community – including current and past students, teachers and parents – were outraged by his dismissal and protests (which hundreds of students took part in) subsequently occurred on school grounds.\n\nAt a meeting held by the school council to address the community (attended by in excess of 800 people), some members of the community expressed their lack of faith in the council, speculating that the circumstances regarding Brown's dismissal had political motivations and asked for the council to step down and be replaced by a democratically elected body. A large portion of the school community – including a representative of the student whose hair was cut – demanded that Brown be reinstated.\nBoth Roderick Lyle (the school council chairman) and Michael Davies promised to consider the issue and reflect on the necessary actions. Following a town hall meeting of 13 March, which organisers said was attended by well over 1500 members of the school community, in addition to an online petition with over 6900 signatures, three members of the school council, including Lyle, tendered their resignations. Previous council chairman Robert Utter was installed as chairman, and an independent review of Brown's sacking was announced (led by former Federal Court judge Raymond Finkelstein QC and barrister Renee Enbom).\n\nHowever, the appointment of Utter sparked only more controversy as it was viewed by many that Utter was an unacceptable choice for chairman as he was an existing council member prior to the incident, that he was partially responsible for the \"cultural shift\" that the school had faced in recent years, and that – after 24 years on the council – he was no longer connected with the school community. The OTGA called for Utter to resign, strongly urging an independent chairman be appointed.\n\nBrown was reinstated on 11 April before the commencement of Term 2 after the school's independent review showed that he was unjustly removed from his role despite breaching the school's code of conduct.\n\nThen, on 15 May, Michael Davies announced his resignation from the role of headmaster, sending out a letter stating that it came \"after a great deal of thought and discussion with [his] family\". He left his job at the end of term, on 29 June. The school council was almost entirely replaced on 5 June 2018. A former principal of Carey Baptist Grammar School, Phil De Young, was appointed interim headmaster until a permanent one could be found. De Young and the new school council led a process of community consultation and reconciliation to restore the school to a state of harmony.\n\nNotable alumni of Trinity Grammar School include:\n\n"}

{"id": "1969807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969807", "title": "Polygene", "text": "Polygene\n\nA \"polygene” or \"multiple gene inheritance\" is a member of a group of non-epistatic genes that interact additively to influence a phenotypic trait. The term \"monozygous\" is usually used to refer to a hypothetical gene as it is often difficult to characterise the effect of an individual gene from the effects of other genes and the environment on a particular phenotype. Advances in statistical methodology and high throughput sequencing are, however, allowing researchers to locate candidate genes for the trait. In the case that such a gene is identified, it is referred to as a quantitative trait locus (QTL). These genes are generally pleiotropic as well. The genes that contribute to type 2 diabetes are thought to be mostly polygenes. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.\n\nTraits with polygenic determinism correspond to the classical quantitative characters, as opposed to the qualitative characters with monogenic or oligogenic determinism. In essence instead of two options, such as freckles or no freckles, there are many variations, like the color of skin, hair, or even eyes.\n\nPolygenic locus is any individual locus which is included in the system of genes responsible for the genetic component of variation in a quantitative (polygenic) character. Allelic substitutions contribute to the variance in a specified quantitative character. Polygenic locus may be either a single or complex genetic locus in the conventional sense, i.e., either a single gene or closely linked block of functionally related genes.\n\nIn modern sense, the inheritance mode of polygenic patterns is called polygenic inheritance, whose main properties may be summarized as follows:\n\nPolygenic inheritance occurs when one characteristic is controlled by two or more genes. Often the genes are large in quantity but small in effect. Examples of human polygenic inheritance are height, skin color, eye color and weight. Polygenes exist in other organisms, as well. \"Drosophila\", for instance, display polygeny with traits such as wing morphology, bristle count and many others.\n\nThe frequency of the phenotypes of these traits generally follows a normal continuous variation distribution pattern. This results from the many possible allelic combinations. When the values are plotted, a bell-shaped curve is obtained. The mode of the distribution represents the optimal, or fittest, phenotype. The more genes are involved, the smoother the estimated curve. However, in this model all genes must code for alleles with additive effects. This assumption is often unrealistic as many genes display epistasis effects which can have unpredictable effects on the distribution of outcomes, especially when looking at the distribution on a fine scale.\n\nTraditionally, mapping polygenes requires statistical tools available to help measure the effects of polygenes as well as narrow in on single genes. One of these tools is QTL-mapping. QTL-mapping utilizes a phenomenon known as linkage disequilibrium by comparing known marker genes with correlated phenotypes. Often, researchers will find a large region of DNA, called a locus, that accounts for a significant amount of the variation observed in the measured trait. This locus will usually contain a large number of genes that are responsible. A new form of QTL has been described as expression QTL (eQTL). eQTLs regulate the amount of expressed mRNA, which in turn regulates the amount of protein within the organism.\n\nAnother interest of statistical geneticists using QTL mapping is to determine the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying a phenotypic trait. For example, they may be interested in knowing whether a phenotype is shaped by many independent loci, or by a few loci, and do those loci interact. This can provide information on how the phenotype may be evolving.\n\n(de)Polygenie\n"}

Kessler knew lead singer Paul Banks from a summer program in Paris, France, and asked him to join the band when he ran into him in New York. Kessler's dormmate Greg Drudy was Interpol's first drummer. When Drudy left the band, Kessler asked his friend Sam Fogarino to replace him.\n\nKessler had prior experience in the music industry while working for Domino Recording Company, and his knowledge of the business was very helpful to the band in their early years.

This computer series is notable for providing the first computer to exceed 1 gigaflop, as well as the fastest supercomputer in the world between 1992-1993, and 2002-2004. The current model, as of 2018, is the SX-Aurora TSUBASA.\n\nThe first models, the SX-1 and SX-2, were announced in April 1983, and released in 1985. The SX-2 was the first computer to exceed 1 gigaflop. The SX-1 and SX-1E were less powerful models offered by NEC.\n\nThe SX-3 was announced in 1989, and shipped in 1990. The SX-3 allows parallel computing using both SIMD and MIMD. It also switched from the ACOS-4 based SX-OS, to the AT&T System V UNIX-based SUPER-UX operating system. In 1992 an improved variant, the SX-3R, was announced. A SX-3/44 variant was the fastest computer in the world between 1992-1993 on the TOP500 list.\n\nThe SX-4 series was announced in 1994, and first shipped in 1995. Since the SX-4, SX series supercomputers are constructed in a doubly parallel manner. A number of central processing units (CPUs) are arranged into a parallel vector processing node. These nodes are then installed in a regular SMP arrangement.\n\nThe SX-5 was announced and shipped in 1998, with the SX-6 following in 2001, and the SX-7 in 2002. Starting in 2001, Cray marketed the SX-5 and SX-6 exclusively in the US, and non-exclusively elsewhere for a short time.\n\nThe Earth Simulator, built from SX-6 nodes, was the fastest supercomputer from June 2002 to June 2004 on the LINPACK benchmark, achieving 35.86 TFLOPS. As of 2020, 3 Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti graphics cards can deliver comparable performance, at 14 TFLOPS per card. The SX-9 was introduced in 2007 and discontinued in 2015. \nTadashi Watanabe has been NEC's lead designer for the majority of SX supercomputer systems.

The release featured seven additional tracks including \"Dance Yourself To Death\" – Dust Bros club mix: remixed by the Dust Bros; and a remake of \"The Only Rhyme That Bites\" – Ugly as Sin mix: remixed and remodelled by Tunes for the release.\n\nIn 1992, Tunes recorded the single \"Digital Bad Boy\" / \"Could You Understand\" (Juice Box) with A Guy Called Gerald.\n\n'The Only Rhyme That Bites' video was recorded in the basement of the old Express Newspapers building on Ancoats Lane.\n\nWith the success of the 808 State collaborations and his growing reputation on the global hip hop scene, ZTT Records signed a separate deal with MC Tunes. With the project being overseen by Trevor Horn, recording began at Sarm Studios on a series of tracks in 1991. The result was nine tracks which, with an addition of a new version of \"Dance Yourself To Death\" produced by the Dust Brothers, were intended to be released in album format under the title \"Damage by Stereo\". It is unclear why at the time of its making the album was not released but, in 2012, the entire collection of missing master tapes were rediscovered.\n\nIn April 2014, it was announced that \"Damage by Stereo\" was to be released by Peter Hook's Haçienda Records label.\n\nTracks from the album were previewed in an event at Factory Manchester on Saturday 19 April in an event hosted by Clint Boon of XFM and Inspiral Carpets billed as an evening of talk, tape and performance. The music was played from the original half inch master tapes which had been treated by Advanced Media Restoration in Manchester and played from a reel to reel machine. The event also saw MC Tunes performing material over instrumental versions of the tracks retrieved from the tapes. As no album art had been prepared for the original release Mancunian artist Jay Smith provided the backdrop for the stage as he painted the cover art for Damage by Stereo.\n\nOn Monday 9 February 2015 \"Damage By Stereo\" was eventually released, almost 24 years after it was originally recorded. The album was made available on a limited edition double CD, Serial Number HAC018, featuring the 10 original tracks intended for the album and a five track bonus disc featuring dance remixes by 808 State's Andy Barker, DJ & Producer Mark Wells, the Dust Brothers, TtrueAR and The Laboratory Project. Two slightly different versions of the CD were manufactured. One hundred copies were created for guests at the official album launch party held at South Manchester, with another limited batch of CDs being produced for general release. The album was also made available digitally through Hacienda Records and on various other digital platforms including iTunes and Spotify.\n\nFollowing the stalling of his solo career, Tunes formed the Dust Junkys in 1995, with Sam Brox on guitar, Stephen \"OJ\" Oliver Jones on bass guitar, Mykey Wilson on drums and Ganiyu Pierre Gasper on turntables. The band concentrated on gigging in the Manchester area and then national tours, building audiences for their mix of British hip hop and rock music.\n\nWhilst gigging with the Dust Junkys, Tunes returned to work with 808 State in 1996 on a new track, \"Pump\", taken from their album \"Thermo Kings\" (Warner). It was due to be released as a single, but this never happened. The Dust Junkys were signed to Polydor and released their first single \"Living in the Pocket of a Drug Queen?\" (1997), followed by \"(Nonstopoperation)\" and \"What Time Is It?\" which reached number 39 in the UK chart. The Dust Junkys music was subject to remixes by artists such as Fun Loving Criminals. The track \"Fever\" was featured on the soundtrack for the Sony PlayStation game, \"Driver 2\".\n\nThe most widely recognized piece of Dust Junkys music, originally called \"Rinse (Beatbox Wash)\", released as the B-side of \"Living in the Pocket of a Drug Queen?\", came to prominence as the main hook of Fatboy Slim's \"Gangster Trippin'\". The track peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. \"Gangster Trippin'\" was also featured on the Fatboy Slim album \"You've Come a Long Way, Baby\", where 25% of the songwriting credits were attributed to Dust Junkys and MC Tunes.\n\nIn 1990, ZTT Records commissioned film maker Howard Walmsley to create a film to promote MC Tunes music career. This became the foundation for a film called \"Nish Clish Banging, The MC Tunes Tapes\" which was completed in 2011, and shown in art house cinemas in the North West of England. The University of Central Lancashire screened the film to a capacity crowd at the Mitchell and Kenyon cinema in Preston, Lancashire, on 15 November 2012. The screening was followed by Terry Christian conducting an interview with Lockett and Walmsley, and a question and answer session with the audience. In the interview, Tunes candidly talked about the controversy that had surrounded his career and personal life.\n\nIn addition to being featured in music promotional films, in 2007 Tunes played himself in the independent feature film, \"Diary of a Bad Lad\".\n\nTunes still lives in Manchester.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the second-century geographer Pausanias, Caanthus was commanded by his father Oceanus to seek his sister Melia, who had been abducted by Apollo. But being unable to get Melia away from Apollo, Caanthus set fire to the Apollo's sanctuary, and Apollo shot and killed him.\n\nThe story of Caanthus is a close parallel to the more famous story of Cadmus, the founder and first king of Thebes. Like Caanthus, Cadmus' sister Europa is abducted by an Olympian god (in this case Zeus), and Cadmus is sent by his father to bring Europa back home, and like Caanthus, Cadmus is unsuccessful. Caanthus' story is perhaps also related to the story of the Theban Amphion. According to Hyginus, Amphion, like Caanthus, was shot and killed by Apollo because of an attack on his temple.\n\nAccording to Pausanias, Caanthus was buried near a spring above the Ismenion, the Temple of Apollo at Thebes. Pausanias identified the spring as the famous spring of Ares, where Cadmus killed the dragon guarding it.\n\nAccording to Jacob Bryant Caanthus, Cunthus and Cunæthus are all titles of a Deity called Chan-Thoth in Egypt.\n\n"}

Dizengoff's actions in Ottoman Palestine and the British Mandate for Palestine helped lead to the creation of the State of Israel. David Ben-Gurion declared Israeli independence in 1948 at Dizengoff's residence in Tel Aviv. Dizengoff House is now Israel's Independence Hall.\n\nMeir Dizengoff was born in 1861 in the village of Ekimovtsy near Orhei, Bessarabia. In 1878, his family moved to Kishinev, where he graduated from high school and studied at the polytechnic school. In 1882, he volunteered in the Imperial Russian Army, serving in Zhytomyr (now in the northwestern Ukraine) until 1884. There he first met , whom he married in the early 1890s. After his military service, Dizengoff remained in Odessa, where he became involved in the \"Narodnaya Volya\" underground. In 1885, he was arrested for insurgency. In Odessa, he met Leon Pinsker, Ahad Ha’am and others, and joined the Hovevei Zion movement. Upon his release from prison, Dizengoff returned to Kishinev and founded the Bessarabian branch of Hovevei Zion, which he represented at the 1887 conference. He left Kishinev in 1889 to study in Paris.\n\nIn Kishinev Dizengoff met Theodor Herzl and became an ardent follower. However, Dizengoff strongly opposed the British Uganda Scheme promoted by Herzl at the Sixth Zionist Congress. Instead, Dizengoff favored the formation of Jewish communities in Palestine. Dizengoff became actively involved in land purchases and establishment of Jewish communities, most notably Tel Aviv. \n\nDizengoff was widely regarded as a leader of the Jewish community prior to the establishment of the State of Israel. Many notable world leaders who traveled to Ottoman Palestine and the British Mandate for Palestine met with Meir Dizengoff as a representative of the Jewish community.\n\nWinston Churchill visited Palestine in March 1921 and met with Dizengoff. During a ceremonial speech with Churchill, Dizengoff declared: “this small town of Tel-Aviv, which is hardly 12 years old, has been conquered by us on sand dunes, and we have built it with our work and our exertions.” Churchill was impressed with the motivation and determination of the pioneers, under the leadership of Dizengoff. In Palestine, Churchill told an anti-Zionist delegation: “This country has been very much neglected in the past and starved and even mutilated by Turkish misgovernment… you can see with your own eyes in many parts of this country the work which has already been done by Jewish colonies; how sandy wastes have been reclaimed and thriving farms and orangeries planted in their stead.” That same day he told a Jewish delegation he would inform London that the Zionists are “transforming waste into fertile..planting trees and developing agriculture in desert lands...making for an increase in wealth and cultivation\" and further that the Arab population is “deriving great benefit, sharing in the general improvement and advancement.”\n\nWhile studying chemical engineering at the University of Paris, Dizengoff met Edmond James de Rothschild, who sent him to Ottoman-ruled Palestine to establish a glass factory which would supply bottles for Rothschild's wineries. Dizengoff opened the factory in Tantura in 1892, but it proved unsuccessful due to impurities in the sand, and Dizengoff soon returned to Kishinev. \n\nIn 1905, spurred by his Zionist beliefs, Dizengoff returned to Palestine and settled in Jaffa. He established the \"Geulah\" company, which bought up land in Palestine from Arabs, and became involved in the import business, especially machinery and automobiles to replace the horse-drawn carriages that had served as the primary transportation from Jaffa port to Jerusalem and other towns. He also co-founded a boat company that bore his name, and served as the Belgian consul.\nWhen Dizengoff learned that residents were organizing to build a new neighborhood, Tel Aviv, he formed a partnership with the \"Ahuzat Bayit\" company and bought land on the outskirts of Jaffa, which was parceled out to the early settlers by lot.\n\nDizengoff was one of the founders of the Ahuzat Bayit Company, organized to establish a modern Jewish quarter near the Arab city of Jaffa in 1909. \n\nOn April 11, 1909, sixty-six families gathered on the sandy shoreline to divide up lots of what was to become Tel Aviv. Meir Dizengoff, the civic leader who would be the city's first mayor, participated in the lottery. The moment was captured on film by Abraham Suskind. In the iconic image, members of the collective can be seen standing on sand dunes in the exact location where Rothschild Boulevard currently runs. According to legend, the man standing behind the group, on the slope of the sand dune, is a man who opposed the idea, allegedly telling the others that they are mad because there is no water at the location.\n\nDizengoff became head of the town planning in 1911, a position that he held until 1922. When Tel Aviv was recognized as a city, Dizengoff was elected mayor. He remained in office until his death, apart from a three-year hiatus in 1925–1928. During World War I, the Ottomans drove out a large part of the population and Dizengoff was the liaison between the exiles and the Ottoman authorities. In this position he dealt with aid sent to the exiles of Tel Aviv and received the nickname \"Reish Galuta\". He widely circulated and publicised the plight of the exiles, mainly via newspapers, and succeeded in convincing the rulers to agree to a regular supply of food and provisions to the exiles. In 1917, after having received funding from Nili, Dizengoff refused not only to provide funds to free Nili member Yosef Lishansky, but even funds to provide the succor that Dizengoff provided other prisoners and even anti-Zionists, despite having received the money from Nili.\n\nMany committees and associations came into being during Dizengoff's term as mayor. One was the Levant Fair (Hebrew \"Yarid HaMizrah\") committee, founded in 1932, which organized its first fair that year. Initially, the fair was held in the south of the city, but after its great success, a fairground with designated buildings was built in north Tel Aviv. A large international fair was held in 1934, followed by a second fair two years later.\nDizengoff was consequently involved with the development of the city, and encouraged its rapid expansion—carrying out daily inspections, and paying attention to details such as entertainment. He was always present at the head of the \"Adloyada\", the annual Purim carnival. After his wife's death, he donated his house to the city of Tel Aviv, for use as an art museum, and he influenced many important artists to donate their work to improve the museum.\n\nIn 1936, with the outbreak of the Arab revolt, the Arabs closed the port of Jaffa with the intention of halting the rapid expansion of Jewish settlements in Palestine. Dizengoff pressured the government to give him permission to open a port in his new city of Tel Aviv, and before his death he managed to dedicate the first pier of Tel Aviv's new port. His dedication began with the words: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I can still remember the day when Tel Aviv had no port\". \n\nAfter years of building houses, hospitals, public institutions, a synagogue, etc. Dizengoff wrote “we began to feel the need to foster beauty”. On a visit to Paris, Dizengoff created an artistic committee. Marc Chagall wrote: “Mr. Dizengoff came to me in Paris, asking for help in building a museum. I couldn’t believe the man was seventy years old, his eyes sparkled…though I intended several times to go to the Land of Israel, and every time I cancelled the trip- this time, Mr. Dizengoff’s enthusiasm influenced me.. I packed my things and decided to give him a hand.”\n\nIn June 1931, Marc Chagall and his family traveled to Tel Aviv, on the invitation of Dizengoff, in conjunction with his plan to build a Jewish Museum in the new city. They were invited to stay at Dizengoff's house in Tel Aviv.\nDizengoff died on September 23, 1936.\n\nIn 1930, after the death of his wife, Dizengoff donated his house to his beloved city of Tel Aviv and requested that it be turned into a museum. The house underwent extensive renovations and became the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1932. The museum moved to its current location in 1971.\nOn 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel at the Dizengoff residence. The building is now a history museum and known as Independence Hall.\n\nThere is a monument at Dizengoff House (Independence Hall) honoring both the 66 original families of Tel Aviv as well as a statue of Dizengoff riding his famous horse.\n\nMeir Park and Dizengoff Street are named after him. His name also lives on in Israeli slang: It was used as a verb—\"lehizdangeff\"—which means \"to walk down Dizengoff,\" i.e., go out on the town. Dizengoff Square, featuring a sculpture by Yaacov Agam, is named after his wife, Zina.\n\n"}

Its key signature has three sharps. Its relative minor is F-sharp minor and its parallel minor is A minor. The key of A major is the only key where a Neapolitan sixth chord on formula_1 requires both a flat and a natural accidental.\n\nThe A major scale is:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nIn the treble, alto, and bass clefs, the G in the key signature is placed higher than C. However, in the tenor clef, it would require a ledger line and so G is placed lower than C.\n\nAlthough not as rare in the symphonic literature as sharper keys, examples of symphonies in A major are not as numerous as for D major or G major. Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, Bruckner's Symphony No. 6 and Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 4 comprise a nearly complete list of symphonies in this key in the Romantic era. Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major, along with his 23rd piano concerto, and generally Mozart was more likely to use clarinets in A major than in any other key besides E-flat major. Moreover, the climax part of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto is also in A major.\n\nThe key of A major occurs frequently in chamber music and other music for strings, which favor sharp keys. Franz Schubert's \"Trout Quintet\" and Antonín Dvořák's Piano Quintet No. 2 are both in A major. Johannes Brahms, César Franck, and Gabriel Fauré wrote violin sonatas in A major. In connection to Beethoven's \"Kreutzer Sonata\", Peter Cropper said that A major \"is the fullest sounding key for the violin.\"\n\nAccording to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, A major is a key suitable for \"declarations of innocent love, ... hope of seeing one's beloved again when parting; youthful cheerfulness and trust in God.\"\n\nFor orchestral works in A major, the timpani are typically set to A and E a fifth apart, rather than a fourth apart as for most other keys. Hector Berlioz complained about the custom of his day in which timpani tuned to A and E a fifth apart were notated C and G a fourth apart, a custom which survived as late as the music of Franz Berwald.\n\n"}

A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Richardson played for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, Minnesota Vikings and New York Jets. \n\nHe is considered one of the best fullbacks in NFL history having blocked for 1,000 yards rushers in nine consecutive NFL seasons in addition to leading the Kansas City Chiefs in rushing yards in 2000. During those seasons he blocked for multiple Pro Bowl running backs including Priest Holmes, Larry Johnson, Adrian Peterson and Thomas Jones. \n\nOn March 5, 2016, the Chiefs announced Richardson would be inducted into the team's Hall of Fame during the 2016 season.\n\nRichardson did not start playing football until attending Daleville High School in Daleville, Alabama, where he posted 1,003 rushing yards as a senior. He accepted a scholarship from Auburn University, where he was a three-year starter. He finished his college career with 715 rushing yards, 395 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nRichardson declared for the 1994 NFL Draft, but was not selected by any team. He entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent signed to the Dallas Cowboys. Although he was first waived on April 29, he was later brought back to the team and given the chance to finish training camp. He spent his rookie season on the practice squad as part of a team that included Pro Bowlers Emmitt Smith and Daryl Johnston. At the end of the season, he was declared a free agent.\n\nRichardson signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs on February 28, 1995. He started one game in that season, and was noted for blocking for Hall of Famer Marcus Allen on his way to his 100th career touchdown. He later became the starting fullback for the team, blocking for record setting running back Priest Holmes and the most productive seasons of Larry Johnson's career. He was selected to represent the AFC in the 2004 and 2005 Pro Bowls.\n\nA free agent in the 2006 offseason, Richardson signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He was selected to represent the NFC in the 2008 Pro Bowl after paving the way for Rookie of the Year Adrian Peterson and Chester Taylor. At the end of the 2007 season, the Vikings did not re-sign Richardson, opting to pay for the cheaper Thomas Tapeh.\n\nOn March 6, 2008, Richardson signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets. He was re-signed by the team on February 27, 2009. Following the expiration of his previous contract, Richardson, once again, signed with the team on March 16, 2010. He was released on September 5, but a day later he was re-signed after the Jets reached a deal with cornerback Darrelle Revis.\n\nHe was the recipient of the \"Whizzer\" White NFL Man of the Year Award at the end of the 2010 season. During his time with the Jets, Richardson helped Thomas Jones to two 1,000+ yard seasons.\n\nHis father, sergeant major Ben Richardson, was stationed in Germany when Tony was born, and he lived there for the first eight years of his life. When they returned to the U.S., the family lived in Daleville, Alabama, where Tony excelled as a three-sport letterman in football, basketball, and track & field. He attended Auburn University, where he started most of his four seasons as a fullback for the team, accumulating 162 carries for 715 yards and nine touchdowns. He received his Bachelor of Education degree in 2000, and later got his MBA from Webster University in 2004. Off the field, Richardson is very involved with local charities. He hosts the Kansas City chapter of the annual Special Olympics Punt, Pass & Kick competition, and has served as chairman of many charitable organizations and fundraisers.

Adults can reach a maximum weight of and maximum length of , but average around .\n\nThe rohu occurs in rivers throughout much of northern and central and eastern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, and has been introduced into some of the rivers of Peninsular India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe species is an omnivore with specific food preferences at different life stages. During the early stages of its lifecycle, it eats mainly zooplankton, but as it grows, it eats more and more phytoplankton, and as a juvenile or adult is a herbivorous column feeder, eating mainly phytoplankton and submerged vegetation. It has modified, thin hair-like gill rakers, suggesting that it feeds by sieving the water.\n\nRohu reach sexual maturity between two and five years of age. They generally spawn during the monsoon season, keeping to the middle of flooded rivers above tidal reach. The spawning season of rohu generally coincides with the southwest monsoon. Spawn may be collected from rivers and reared in tanks and lakes.\n\nThe rohu is an important aquacultured freshwater species in South Asia. When cultured, it does not breed in lake ecosystems, so induced spawning is necessary. The rohu is also prized as a game fish.\n\nRohu is very commonly eaten in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and the Indian states of Tripura, Nagaland, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.\nA recipe for fried Rohu fish is mentioned in \"Manasollasa\", a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.

His \"Eroica Symphony\", \"Emperor Concerto\" and \"Grand Sonata\" are all in this key. Also Beethoven's (hypothetical) 10th symphony is in the key of E-flat major. But even before Beethoven, Francesco Galeazzi identified E-flat major as \"a heroic key, extremely majestic, grave and serious: in all these features it is superior to that of C.\"\n\nThree of Mozart's completed horn concertos and Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto are in E-flat major and so is Anton Bruckner's Fourth Symphony with its prominent horn theme in the first movement. Another notable heroic piece in the key of E-flat major is Richard Strauss's \"A Hero's Life\". The heroic theme from the Jupiter movement of Holst's \"The Planets\" is in E-flat major.

Its parallel minor, A-flat minor, is usually replaced by G-sharp minor, since A-flat minor, which would contain seven flats, is not normally used. Its enharmonic, G-sharp major, with eight sharps, including the F, has a similar problem, and so A-flat major is often used as the parallel major for G-sharp minor. (The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of D-flat major and C-sharp minor.)\n\nBeethoven chose A-flat major as the key of the slow movement for most of his C minor works, a practice which Anton Bruckner imitated in his first two C minor symphonies and also Antonín Dvořák in his only C minor symphony. The second movement of Haydn’s 43rd symphony in E-flat major is in A-flat major. Chopin used this key in many of his works.\n\nSince A-flat major was not often chosen as the main key for orchestral works of the 18th century, passages or movements in the key often retained the timpani settings of the preceding movement. For example, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor has the timpani set to C and G for the first movement. With hand-tuned timpani, there is no time to re-tune the timpani to A-flat and E-flat for the slow second movement in A-flat; accordingly, the timpani in this movement are reserved for the passages in C major. In Bruckner's Symphony No. 1 in C minor, however, the timpani are re-tuned between the first movement in C minor and the following in A-flat major.\n\nCharles-Marie Widor considered A-flat major to be the second best key for flute music.\n\nA-flat major was the flattest major key to be used as the home key for the keyboard and piano sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, with each of them using the key for two sonatas: Scarlatti's K. 127 and K. 130, Haydn's Hob XVI 43 and 46, and Beethoven's Op. 26 and Op. 110, while Franz Schubert used it for one piano sonata. It was also the flattest major key to be used for the preludes and fugues in Johann Sebastian Bach's \"Well-Tempered Klavier\", as flatter major keys were notated as their enharmonic equivalents. \n\nFelix Mendelssohn, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, John Field, and Friedrich Kalkbrenner each wrote one piano concerto in A-flat (Mendelssohn's being for two pianos); they had the horns and trumpet tuned to E-flat. Max Bruch's Concerto for Two Pianos in A-flat minor has its last movement in A-flat major, which is the parallel major; this concerto plays with the contrast between the two keys. \n\nScott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag is also written in A-flat major (the trio part of the composition is written in D-flat major).\n\nOther compositions in A-flat major include: \n\n"}

Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the \"real\" subject of an image.\n\nThe use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word \"ma\" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design.\n\nIn a two-tone, black-and-white image, a subject is normally depicted in black and the space around it is left blank (white), thereby forming a silhouette of the subject. Reversing the tones so that the space around the subject is printed black and the subject itself is left blank, however, causes the negative space to be apparent as it forms shapes around the subject. This is called figure-ground reversal.\n\nIn graphic design of printed or displayed materials, where effective communication is the objective, the use of negative space may be crucial. Not only within the typography, but in its placement in relation to the whole. It is the basis of why upper and lower case typography always is more legible than the use of all capital letters. Negative space varies around lower case letters, allowing the human eye to distinguish each word rapidly as one distinctive item, rather than having to parse out what the words are in a string of letters that all present the same overall profile as in all caps. The same judicious use of negative space drives the effectiveness of the entire design. Because of the long history of the use of black ink on white paper, \"white space\" is the term often used in graphics to identify the same separation.\n\nElements of an image that distract from the intended subject, or in the case of photography, objects in the same focal plane, are not considered negative space. Negative space may be used to depict a subject in a chosen medium by showing everything around the subject, but not the subject itself. Use of negative space will produce a silhouette of the subject. Most often, negative space is used as a neutral or contrasting background to draw attention to the main subject, which then is referred to as the positive space.\n\nConsidering and improving the balance between negative space and positive space in a composition is considered by many to enhance the design. This basic, but often overlooked, principle of design gives the eye a \"place to rest,\" increasing the appeal of a composition through subtle means.\n\nThe use of negative space in art may be analogous to silence in music, but only when it is juxtaposed with adjacent musical ideas. As such, there is a difference between inert and active silences in music, where the latter is more closely analogous to negative space in art.\n\n\n"}

It is enharmonically equivalent to C-sharp major. Its key signature has five flats.\n\nThe D-flat major scale is:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nIts relative minor is B-flat minor. Its parallel minor, D-flat minor, is usually replaced by C-sharp minor, since D-flat minor features a B in its key signature and C-sharp minor only has four sharps, making it rare for D-flat minor to be used. C-sharp major, its enharmonic, with seven sharps, has a similar problem. Therefore, D-flat major is often used as the parallel major for C-sharp minor. (The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of A-flat major and G-sharp minor).\n\nFor example, in his Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major (\"Raindrop\"), Frédéric Chopin switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor for the middle section in the parallel minor, while in his \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\" and Scherzo No. 3, primarily in C-sharp minor, he switches to D-flat major for the middle section for the opposite reason. Ferdinand Ries' third concerto likewise switches to D-flat major for a while for the return of the second theme in the first movement. Claude Debussy also switches from D-flat major to C-sharp minor in the significant section in his famous \"Clair de lune\". Antonín Dvořák's \"New World Symphony\" likewise switches to C-sharp minor for a while for the significant section in the slow movement.\n\nD-flat major is enharmonic to C-sharp major. In music for the harp, D-flat major would be preferable, not only because harp strings are more resonant in the flat position and the key has fewer accidentals, but also because modulation to the dominant key is easier (by putting the G pedal in the natural position, whereas there is no double-sharp position in which to put the F pedal for G-sharp major).\n\nHector Berlioz called this key \"majestic\" in his 1856 \"Grand Traité d'Instrumentation et d'Orchestration modernes\", while having a much different opinion of its enharmonic counterpart. Despite this, when he came to orchestrate Carl Maria von Weber's piano piece \"Invitation to the Dance\" in 1841, he transposed it from D-flat to D major, to give the strings a more manageable key and to produce a brighter sound.\n\nCharles-Marie Widor considered D-flat major to be the best key for flute music.\n\nAlthough this key was relatively unexplored during the Baroque and Classical periods and was not often used as the main key for orchestral works of the 18th century, Franz Schubert used it quite frequently in his sets of écossaises, valses and so on, as well as entering it and even flatter keys in his sonatas, impromptus and the like. Ludwig van Beethoven, too, used this key extensively in his second piano concerto. D-flat major was used as the key for the slow movements of Joseph Haydn's Piano Sonata Hob XVI:46 in A-flat major, and Beethoven's \"Appassionata Sonata\".\n\nA part of the trio of Scott Joplin's Maple Leaf Rag is written in D-flat major.\n\nThe flattened pitches of D-flat major correspond to the black keys of the piano, and there is much significant piano music written in this key. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is written in B-flat minor, but the famous opening theme is in D-flat major. Tchaikovsky composed the second movement of Piano Concerto No. 1 also in D-flat. Sergei Rachmaninoff composed the famous 18th variation of his \"Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini\" in this key, perhaps emphasizing the generally held view that D-flat major is the most romantically flavoured of the major keys; and his friend Nikolai Medtner similarly chose it for the sensually romantic \"big tune\" in the last movement of his Piano Concerto No. 3 (\"Ballade\"). Claude Debussy also composed the famous \"Clair de lune\" in this key, with a significant section in C-sharp minor. Edvard Grieg composed the second movement of his Piano Concerto in D-flat. Frédéric Chopin'sNocturne in D-flat, Op. 27, is in this key. Franz Liszt composed heavily in this key, with his most recognizable piece being the third movement of his piano composition \"Trois études de concert\", dubbed \"Un sospiro\". Liszt took advantage of the piano's configuration of the key and used it to create an arpeggiating melody using alternating hands.\n\nIn orchestral music, the examples are fewer. Gustav Mahler concluded his last completed Ninth Symphony with an adagio in D-flat major, rather than the home key of D major of the first movement. Anton Bruckner wrote the third movement of his Symphony No. 8 in D-flat major, while every other movement is in C minor. Antonín Dvořák wrote the second movement of his Symphony No. 9 in D-flat major, while every other movement is in E minor. The first piano concerto of Sergei Prokofiev is also written in D-flat major, with a short slow movement in G-sharp minor. Aram Khachaturian wrote his Piano Concerto, Op. 38, in the key of D-flat major. Choral writing explores D-flat infrequently, a notable example being Robert Schumann's \"Requiem\", Op. 148, and Gabriel Fauré's \"Cantique de Jean Racine\".

As a senior, he was named an All-American by \"Parade\" and \"Scholastic Coach\" magazines and received the Gatorade Circle of Champions \"Player of the Year\" award and Tennessee Class 2A Mr. Football lineman award. Clifton's team lost in the state playoffs in his junior and senior years to Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee, whose offensive coordinator was former Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze.\n\nIn 1995, Clifton enrolled at the University of Tennessee and redshirted his first year. From then on, he was a fixture on the offensive line. He started one season at the right tackle position and three at the left tackle position. During these four years, the Tennessee Volunteers enjoyed great success with a 43-7 record and a win in the Fiesta Bowl over Florida State following the 1998 regular season to claim the National Championship. Clifton was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference selection (1997 second team, 1998 first team) and a \"Sporting News\" second-team All-American as a senior.\n\nDuring the 2000 NFL Draft, the Packers selected Clifton in the second round with the 44th overall pick.\n\nHalfway through his rookie season, Clifton took over the starting left tackle position and would remain there for the rest of the season. He enjoyed continued success during his second season when he established a reputation as one of the NFL's best and unheralded blindside blockers for Brett Favre.\n\nClifton's 2002 season seemed as promising as his first two. However, on November 24, he suffered a severe pelvic injury after receiving a blindside hit from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Warren Sapp. Because the incident occurred after an interception with Clifton far from the play, Sapp received harsh criticism for his action.\nAfter the game, when Packers head coach Mike Sherman told Sapp that his play was uncalled for, Sapp began angrily shouting at Sherman in a tirade that was caught on camera, with Sapp famously screaming \"put a jersey on\". As a result of his injury, Clifton missed the rest of the season, was hospitalized for almost a week, and could not walk unaided for five more weeks. In 2005, the NFL Competition Committee agreed on new guidelines for \"unnecessary roughness\", making hits such as that suffered by Clifton illegal.\n\nClifton returned in 2003 to start all 16 regular season games and two more games in the playoffs. He played all 1,031 offensive snaps that season and contributed to establishing a team record for fewest sacks allowed in a season with 19.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, it was announced that he would replace Seattle Seahawks tackle Walter Jones in the 2008 Pro Bowl, which was his first career Pro Bowl. He went to Hawaii to the Pro Bowl with teammates wide receiver Donald Driver, defensive end Aaron Kampman, and cornerback Al Harris, as well as head coach Mike McCarthy. Clifton's quarterback, Brett Favre, was scheduled to be in the Pro Bowl, but was replaced by Jeff Garcia.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, the Packers re-signed Clifton to a three-year, $20 million contract, with $7.5 million guaranteed.\n\nAt the end of the 2010 season, Clifton and the Packers appeared in Super Bowl XLV. He was a starter in the 31–25 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nClifton had a successful season in 2010, which culminated in his second career Pro Bowl nomination.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, Clifton was released by the Packers after failing a physical.\n\nClifton did not sign with another NFL team after his release.\n\n"}

Its key signature has six flats.\n\nIts relative minor is E-flat minor (or enharmonically D-sharp minor), and its parallel minor is G-flat minor, usually replaced by F-sharp minor, since G-flat minor's two double-flats make it generally impractical to use. Its direct enharmonic equivalent, F-sharp major, contains the same number of sharps.\n\nThe G-flat major scale is:\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c\" {\n\n</score>\n\nLike F-sharp major, G-flat major is rarely chosen as the main key for orchestral works. It is more often used as a main key for piano works, such as the impromptus of Chopin and Schubert. It is the predominant key of Maurice Ravel's \"Introduction and Allegro\" for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet.\n\nA striking use of G-flat major can be found in the love duet \"Tu l'as dit\" that concludes the fourth act of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera \"Les Huguenots\".\n\nItalian composer Ottorino Respighi composed Notturno in G-flat major, composed in 1904.\n\nWhen writing works in all 24 major and minor keys, Alkan, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Shchedrin and Winding used G-flat major over F-sharp major. Muzio Clementi chose F-sharp in his set for the prelude, but G-flat for the final \"Grande Exercice\" which modulates through all the keys.\n\nAntonín Dvořák composed Humoresque No. 7 in G-flat major, while its middle section is F-sharp minor.\n\nGustav Mahler was fond of using G-flat major in key passages of his symphonies. Examples include: the choral entry during the finale of his Second Symphony, during the first movement of his Third Symphony, the modulatory section of the Adagietto from his Fifth Symphony, and during the Rondo-Finale of his Seventh Symphony. Mahler's Tenth Symphony was composed in the enharmonic key of F-sharp major.\n\nThis key is more often found in piano music, as the use of all five black keys allows an easier conformity to the player's hands, despite the numerous flats. In particular, the black keys G, A, B, D, and E correspond to the 5 notes of the G-flat Pentatonic Scale. Austrian composer Franz Schubert chose this key for his third impromptu from his first collection of impromptus (1827). Polish composer Frédéric Chopin wrote two études in the key of G-flat major: Étude Op. 10, No. 5 \"Black Key\" and Étude Op. 25, No. 9 \"Butterfly\". French composer Claude Debussy used this key for one of his most popular compositions, \"La fille aux cheveux de lin\", the eighth prélude from his \"Préludes, Book I\" (1909-1910).\n"}

It is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nWindsor station opened on 1 December 1864 coinciding with that of the Richmond line. It was constructed by W & A Elphinstone. The original station building was a combination residence and office, as were built at Riverstone railway station and Mulgrave railway station on the same line. This was purchased and relocated to be converted into a private home in Milhelm Street.\n\nA major upgrading of most stations on this line occurred in the 1880s, including Windsor. In April 1883 the contract for a brick station building and platform was awarded to G. Jones. The station was rebuilt with the goods yard including the brick faced platform. The present brick platform building dates from 1884 and its design reflects similar buildings at Riverstone and Richmond.\n\nA skillion roof and timber clad signal box constructed 1916 behind the Up end of the platform is no longer extant. A timber and gable roofed ex-goods shed on the Down side of the track beyond the Down end of the platform was extant in 2001 but is no longer extant.\n\nThe line was electrified in 1991. Plans show alterations to the station building . The platform building was extensively repaired and upgraded in 1997. All platform structures other than the main brick building were removed.\n\nBusways operates 10 routes via Windsor station:\n\nHillsbus operates one route via Windsor station:\n\nMost buses travel to Windsor shops on Kable Street and Hawkesbury Hospital during the day before/after Windsor station.\n\nWindsor station is served by one NightRide route:\n\nThe Windsor station complex consists of a type-3, second-class roadside brick station building with a brick-faced platform (both (1883). The goods yard contains a brick-faced platform, class 1, 5 tonne iron Philadelphia jib crane (1880s), modern steel framed, corrugated metal sheds (), and a Corrugated metal gabled gangers shed with timber frame ().\n\nThe Windsor station building is a large face-brick building in what is known as a type 3 second class roadside sign. It is a symmetrically organised central building with two wings attached to either side. The Down side wing is a rectangular larger building while the Up end wing is almost a square building. The central building features a hipped and valley slate roof, two tall brick chimneys with corbelled tops and round hoods, moulded and dentilated eaves, a corrugated iron ogee style veranda along the street side of the central building, and a wide corrugated metal platform awning supported on cast iron columns, exposed rafters and decorative brackets. Wings feature flat roofs obscured behind low parapets and moulded cornices. The building's vertically proportioned fenestration is original with cement rendered lintels resembling segmental stone arch appearance.\n\nThe building retains much of its internal original elements including moulded plaster cornices, timber skirtings, fireplace (blocked), mini orb ceiling lining in the office and timber joinery. The overall historic character of the interiors are evident despite the changes and refurbishments overtime.\n\nThe station building is generally in very good condition.\n\nWindsor station has a brick faced road side platform with concrete deck and asphalt finish. White aluminium palisade fencing has been erected along the station street boundary and both ends of the platform. Modern platform furniture, bins, light fittings and signage also feature along the platform.\n\nThe yard is a large, irregularly shaped site that is fenced and contains remnants of the 19th century Windsor station goods yard. It is an overgrown yard with patches of concrete and asphalt slabs and remnants of rail sidings and anchor points on the ground.\n\nRemnants of the former curved brick faced goods platform are evident under the overgrown vegetation and rubble.\nAn original 1880s goods crane fixed on an octagonal concrete base is the only intact extant element of the former goods yard. It is an iron jib crane with a hook dropping from the end of a single rotating arm. The crane is a Class 1, 5 tonne hand crane, No T181.\n\nThere are three modern steel framed sheds within the goods yard; One is a large corrugated metal sheeted and gabled shed, with two identical metal sheeted small sheds behind it.\n\nLocated beyond the fenced area of the goods yard, the gangers shed is a timber framed gabled shed with corrugated metal wall and roof sheeting. It features timber floorboards, timber roof trusses, timber sliding loading doors, and wire mesh covered windows. The gangers shed is in poor condition both internally and externally. Only roof sheeting appears to be new fabric and is in good condition.\n\nNotable moveable items include:\n\nThe former goods yard has high archaeological potential due to the extent of remnant rail sidings, anchor points and former goods platform dating to the first railway.\n\nThe goods yard is in relatively poor condition due to overgrown vegetation and patches of rubble storage.\n\n\nWindsor Railway Station is of state significance as one of the stations built during the major upgrading works along the Richmond line in the 1880s providing evidence of the prosperity, and social and economic development of the Windsor area following the arrival of the railway during the 19th Century. The 1883 station building is a fine example of a Victorian second-class station building and is a significant landmark within the historic town centre. The goods yard is of research significance for its potential to yield information on the operational system and layout of the late 19th century goods handling through the remnants of rail sidings, brick faced platform, hand crane and anchor points. However, its integrity has been compromised due to the removal of the majority of its associated structures and its non-operational state.\n\nWindsor railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nWindsor Station is historically significant as one of the stations built during the major upgrading works along Richmond line in the 1880s, maintaining physical evidence of a station layout including a goods yard dating from the early 1880s. Although buildings other than the main station building have been removed the station together with the hand crane and brick faced platform of the goods yard are important in demonstrating the configuration, styles and elements that were used in the goods handling and transport in the farming district of the Hawkesbury at the time.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nConstructed in 1883, the station building is aesthetically significant as a fine example of a Victorian second-class road side station building providing evidence of the prosperity, and social and economic development of the Windsor area. The building is a landmark within the historic town centre.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe goods yard has potential to yield information on the operational system and layout of late 19th century goods handling through the remnants of rail sidings, the brick faced platform, crane and anchor points. The extent of surviving remnant elements warrant brief archaeological investigation.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nWindsor Station combined with its associated goods yard is a rare example of an 1880s railway station layout despite being modified and the majority of the structures removed.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nWindsor Station is one of three stations (others Richmond and Riverstone) incorporating larger station buildings built on the Richmond line in the 1880s that differ significantly from other smaller and simpler stations on the line. The station building is a fine example of a late nineteenth century second-class station building representing the peak of achievement in station architecture.\n\n"}

Bush written by \"faithful holdouts in Bush's pep squad [who] are happy to have endowed him with superpowers\" by writing \"hagiography mash notes whose toothy gleam of triumphalism was almost blinding.\" Reporter David Weigel has sarcastically referred to these books as \"scathing critiques of presidential power.\" \"The American Prospect\" wrote that Sammon \"wrote an astonishing four books on the topic of Bush's super-awesomeness.\"\n\nHe is a frequent guest on FoxNews shows like \"Special Report with Brit Hume,\" \"Fox News Sunday,\" and \"Hannity & Colmes.\" On September 13, 2007, Sammon appeared on Special Report and argued that Theodore Olson should be confirmed as Attorney General.\n\nOn February 27, 2009, Sammon was promoted to vice president of Fox News and Washington managing editor.\n\nMedia watchdog group Media Matters for America published memos allegedly written by Sammon while he was Washington managing editor at Fox News where he reminded recipients not to refer to the public option proposal in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by name, but instead use terms like \"government-run health insurance\" or to use various qualifiers. The publication of the memos received attention from media observers.\n\nAnother leaked memo showed Sammon gave orders for Fox to cast then-Senator Obama as a socialist. \"Sammon repeatedly said Obama's remarks were \"tantamount to socialism\", on-air and in a FoxNews.com column, while sending around a memo noting \"Obama's references to socialism, liberalism, Marxism and Marxists\" in \"Dreams From My Father\".\" Some questions asked by Fox journalists were allegedly scripted by Sammon. Sammon later explained the incident as a product of his \"rather mischievous speculation about whether Barack Obama really advocated socialism, a premise that privately I found rather far-fetched.\"\n\nIn 2009, amid the Copenhagen Summit, Sammon instructed Fox News reporters to \"refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed (or cooled) in any given period without IMMEDIATELY pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question.\"\n\n"}

Schenkl, an Austrian, and her baby daughter were left without support in wartime Europe by Bose, following his departure for Southeast Asia in February 1943 and death in 1945. In 1948, both were met by Bose's brother Sarat Chandra Bose and his family in Vienna in an emotional meeting. In the post-war years, Schenkl worked shifts in the trunk exchange and was the main breadwinner of her family, which included her daughter and her mother.\nEmilie Schenkl was born in Vienna on 26 December 1910 in an Austrian Catholic family. Paternal granddaughter of a shoemaker and the daughter of a veterinarian, she started primary school late—towards the end of the Great war—on account of her father's reluctance for her to have formal schooling. Her father, moreover, became unhappy with her progress in secondary school and enrolled her in a nunnery for four years. Schenkl decided against becoming a nun and went back to school, finishing when she was 20. The Great Depression had begun in Europe; consequently, for a few years she was unemployed.\n\nShe was introduced to Bose through a mutual friend, Dr. Mathur, an Indian physician living in Vienna. Since Schenkl could take shorthand and her English and typing skills were good, she was hired by Bose, who was writing his book, \"The Indian Struggle\". They soon fell in love and were married in a secret Hindu ceremony in 1937, but without a Hindu priest, witnesses, or civil record. Bose went back to India and reappeared in Nazi Germany during April 1941–February 1943.\n\nSoon, according to historian Romain Hayes, \"the (German) Foreign Office procured a luxurious residence for (Bose) along with a butler, cook, gardener, and an SS-chauffeured car. Emilie Schenkl moved in openly with him. The Germans, aware of the nature of the relationship, refrained from any involvement.\" However, most of the staff in the Special Bureau for India, which had been set up to aid Bose, did not get along with Emilie. In particular Adam von Trott, Alexander Werth and Freda Kretschemer, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, \"appear to have disliked her intensely. They believed that she and Bose were not married and that she was using her liaison with Bose to live an especially comfortable life during the hard times of war\" and that differences were compounded by issues of class. In November 1942, Schenkl gave birth to their daughter. In February 1943, Bose left Schenkl and their baby daughter and boarded a German submarine to travel, via transfer to a Japanese submarine, to Japanese-occupied southeast Asia, where with Japanese support he formed a Provisional Government of Free India and revamped an army, the Indian National Army, whose goal was to gain India's independence militarily with Japanese help. Bose's military effort, however, was unsuccessful.\n\nSchenkl and her daughter survived the war. During their nine years of marriage, Schenkl and Bose spent less than three years together, putting strains on Schenkl. In the post-war years, Schenkl worked shifts in the trunk exchange and was the main breadwinner of her family, which included her daughter and her mother. Although some family members from Bose's extended family, including his brother Sarat Chandra Bose, welcomed Schenkl and her daughter and met with her in Austria, Schenkl never visited India. According to her daughter, Schenkl was a very private woman and tight-lipped about her relationship with Bose. Schenkl died in 1996.\n\n"}

The show shared some of the stream-of-consciousness style of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", of which Chapman was a member. Actors included Mark Wing-Davey and Simon Jones.\n\nThe concept of the show was, according to Chapman, to follow the exploits of two modern-day linguists who would travel around a Britain gripped in rapid decline. The linguists would comment upon the origins of a word or phrase, which would then be the genesis of a sketch. Although two scripts were written (the second a collaboration between Chapman and David Yallop), only one episode was ever filmed. It was broadcast only once by the BBC, with little promotion, at 10pm on Saturday 10 January 1976 opposite \"Match of the Day\", and so was seen by relatively few people.\n\nThe videotape recording of the show has since been wiped, as used to be common for archived BBC shows, due to the relatively high cost of videotape at the time. The film segments shot in outdoor locations survive, and consist of a sketch titled \"Severance of a Peony\", and some inserts intended for an item about Genghis Khan. The former was included on the DVD for Adams's 1981 TV series adaptation of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", and also appeared, rewritten as an anecdote, in Chapman's book \"A Liar's Autobiography\". Rewrites of the Genghis Khan sketch appear in some editions of Adams's posthumously published work \"The Salmon of Doubt\" as the short story \"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\".\n\nIt was reported in 2005, by a representative posting on the forum at the archive television website The Mausoleum Club, that a videotape made by Chapman on an obsolete format had been given to the National Film Television and Videotape Archive. It was restored, a process which took 2 years and shown at the National Film Theatre on Saturday, 2 December 2006 as part of the Missing Believed Wiped event. It was shown again on 24 September 2019 as part of the BFI commemoration of fifty years of Python. \n\n"}

After a criminal trial in which she cooperated with investigators and informed on the ringleaders, she was sentenced on 13 February 2006 to life imprisonment. Her appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the life sentence reduced to 20 years was successful on 26 April 2006.\n\nLawrence was moved from Kerobokan Prison in late 2013 to a prison in Negara, Bali after authorities accused her of a plot to kill prison guards. At her own request in March 2014, Lawrence was subsequently transferred to a prison in Bangli to be closer to Denpasar for her family and visitors.\n\nWhen given a five-month remission of sentence on Indonesia's Independence Day in 2009, her sentence was commuted in 2018. She was released and deported on 21 November 2018.\n\nLawrence, from Newcastle, New South Wales, lived for a decade with her same sex partner, who was ten years her senior. After this relationship ended in October 2004, Lawrence moved back in with her mother and stepfather. Her biological father described Lawrence, who was 27 at the time of her arrest, as being naïve and unworldly.\n\nInitially employed as a trainee panel beater with a smash repair company, Lawrence later gained employment at Eurest, a catering company, where she met Martin Stephens, Matthew Norman, and her supervisor, Andrew Chan. All four were later convicted of drug trafficking as members of the Bali Nine.\n\nMedia reports claim that in early October 2004 Lawrence was invited to Chan's Enfield (Sydney) home to celebrate her 27th birthday. Chan allegedly told her that she was to travel with him to Bali without being told the detail behind the mission. Lawrence claimed that Chan would cover all flights and accommodation. However, if she disobeyed him or disclosed the nature of their arrangement, he would harm her family. Conversely, Lawrence would be rewarded for following instructions. It was also reported that she met Myuran Sukumaran around this time. On 16 October 2004, Lawrence flew to Bali on what Indonesian police claim was a false passport. It was alleged that Chan entered Bali on the same date. Lawrence claimed that she was in regular contact with Chan whilst she stayed in the Istana Rama Hotel in Kuta, and Chan in Kuta's sprawling Hard Rock complex. Media reports stated that Lawrence alleged that on 22 October 2004, Sukumaran strapped packages to the body of both Lawrence and Chan, and with Chan's girlfriend, Grace, boarded a commercial flight to Australia, successfully clearing security, customs and immigration in both Indonesia and Australia. Lawrence claimed that she and Chan were met at the airport, the packages removed, all of them taken to another house, and then Lawrence went home. A few days later Lawrence claimed that Chan handed her an envelope with A$10,000 cash.\n\nA similar trip was organised following Chan's orders, Lawrence claimed, where she departed Australia on 5 December 2004. Lawrence claimed that seven others were involved, including Chan, Matthew Norman, and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen (going by the alias of David). Lawrence claim that she was again given cash to purchase flights and accommodation for eight days, staying again at the Istana Rama in Kuta. However, the second delivery was aborted when heroin suppliers failed to deliver \"due to a financial matter or someone knowing about the plan the shipment was cancelled\".\n\nAccording to Lawrence, again under Chan's instructions, Lawrence departed Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Lawrence, Stephens and Si Yi Chen met with Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling tools such as sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Lawrence and Stephens. Lawrence claims she was given cash; whilst Stephens claims that his life was threatened. Media reports claim that police records show that Lawrence was in daily contact with Chan, whilst in Bali, until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, he instructed Lawrence and other members of the Bali Nine to change hotels. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans.\n\nLawrence was arrested by Indonesian police on 17 April 2005 at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Heroin weighing was discovered strapped to her legs and chest, concealed underneath her clothing. Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj and Stephens were arrested at the same time as Lawrence. On 20 April 2005, graphic footage of the arrests and subsequent police questioning of Lawrence and other members of the Bali Nine was aired on Australian television.\n\nOn the same day that Lawrence was arrested, Indonesian police also arrested Chen, Nguyen, Sukumaran and Norman at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Alleged co-ringleader, Chan was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. On her arrest, Lawrence accused Chan of threatening her life if she did not continue with the plan to import drugs. Lawrence also claimed, but later retracted her statement that Chan had offered her A$15,000 if she followed his instructions. Lawrence also rejected police allegations that she travelled to Bali previously on a false passport.\n\nLee Rush, the father of Scott Rush (a fellow member of the Bali Nine) said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens.\n\nCommenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying:\nRush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney-General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006.\n\nIn December 2005, as the trials began, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment. Lawyers acting for Stephens, one of the Bali Nine, claimed the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians should be prepared for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty.\n\nCzugaj and Rush, both since convicted members of the Bali Nine and school friends from Brisbane, testified that they had never met Lawrence or Stephens until they were all arrested together at Ngurah Rai Airport. Rush also testified against Lawrence at her trial; whilst Lawrence testified against both Rush and Chan. Meanwhile, in a counter-claim, Chan alleged that it was Lawrence who was the ringleader. Chan claimed that Lawrence had given him Rp1 million to take suitcases with heroin to the Melasti Hotel.\n\nIt was reported that the indictment claimed that Lawrence was a drug mule who was recruited in Sydney, was paid for her return flight and accommodation to Bali by members of the conspiracy and then had of heroin strapped to her body by Chan, Sukumaran and another of the group. Central to Lawrence's defence was her fear of Chan and the alleged retributions Chan, her former manager at Eurest, was planning to take on her family if she and others did not follow Chan's orders. Lawrence admitted to her role in attempting to smuggle the drugs to Australia, saying before the Denpasar District Court on 8 January 2006:\nIn spite of widespread media reports that Lawrence had been cooperative with police, the Indonesian judges found no evidence of Lawrence claims her life was threatened. Judge I Gusti Ngurah Astawa said during sentencing:\n\nIn what was an apparent shock for Lawrence and her defence team, she was sentenced on 13 February 2006 to life imprisonment, together with Rush. Commenting on the sentences at the time, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty stated:\n\nThe Australian Prime Minister John Howard was reported as commenting:\n\nAs verdicts and sentences were handed down in the trials of the Bali Nine, additional arrests were made in Australia.\n\nIn 2005, Lawrence reportedly attempted suicide twice in prison and also suffered a broken arm due to a self harm incident. These incidents occurred after learning that Andrew Chan was to be moved to the same prison.\n\nIn June 2006, Lawrence claimed she had a Balinese girlfriend with whom she shared a prison cell. Lawrence and Schapelle Corby, both serving time for drug trafficking in Kerobokan Prison, developed a close but at times fraught relationship. In an interview with \"Woman's Day\" magazine, Lawrence said she was appointed to care for Corby and had watched Corby's mental stability deteriorate.\n\nLawrence appealed the sentence to the Indonesian Supreme Court. On 26 April 2006, a sentence of 20 years imprisonment was handed down. In November 2018 her sentence was commuted, and she was released and deported to Australia on 21 November 2018.\n\nUpon return to Australia in November 2018, Lawrence handed herself in to NSW Police pursuant to outstanding warrants for car theft, driving unlicensed, exceeding the speed limit by 40 km/h and failing to stop for police on 26 March 2005. Lawrence was due to appear on 26 April 2005 in the Gosford Magistrates Court. However, due to her arrest in Indonesia nine days earlier, she failed to appear. In November 2018, Lawrence was released on bail for subsequent hearing in Newcastle Local Court on 6 December 2018. The case was then adjourned until 17 January 2019, at which time Lawrence's lawyer entered a guilty plea for sentencing on 1 February 2019, and was given a $1,000.00 fine with a twelve-month Community Corrections Order.\n"}

At age 14, her first songs were broadcast on the radio. She studied singing and acting at the Shulamit Studio in Tel Aviv, where she met Shlomo Bosmi, the studio manager who became her personal manager. They wed in 1939, when she was only 16.\n\nIn 1945, Damari joined Li-La-Lo, a revue theater established by impresario Moshe Wallin. The group performed light entertainment and satire as a counterweight to the serious theater of the time.\nDamari became known for her distinctive husky voice and Yemenite pronunciation. Her first record was released in 1948 and her best-known song \"Kalaniyot\" (Anemones), by Moshe Vilenski, dates from that period. She was especially popular among Israeli soldiers, for whom she frequently performed. After the independence of Israel and throughout the late 70s, Damari performed all over the United States, France, England, South Africa, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Canada, Scandinavia and Japan. She was warmly received by the audience at national and international festivals in Israel and abroad, serving as Israel's unofficial cultural ambassador and earning the title of “First lady of Israeli song.”\nIn the mid-1980s, Damari teamed up with Boaz Sharabi for a duet that brought her back into the limelight.

While \"Asini Marrucine\" could be translated simply as \"Asinius Marrucinus\", the inverted word order introduces the alternative meaning \"Marrucinus [son] of a jackass\". Napkins in Ancient Rome were handmade and therefore far more valuable than they are today; also, Catullus has a sentimental attachment to the napkins, as they were a gift from two close friends, Fabullus and Veranius. In comparison to Catullus' other invective poetry, this is relatively light: the main point of the poem could be to praise Pollio rather than to chide Marrucinus.\n\nThe meter of this poem is hendecasyllabic, a common form in Catullus' poetry.\n\n\n"}

It is the visual effect of the relationships of the various objects and spaces that make up a structure to one another and to the whole. These relationships are often governed by multiples of a standard unit of length known as a \"module\".\n\nProportion in architecture was discussed by Vitruvius, Leon Battista Alberti, Andrea Palladio, and Le Corbusier among others.\n\nArchitecture in Roman antiquity was rarely documented except in the writings of Vitruvius' treatise \"De architectura\". Vitruvius served as an engineer under Julius Caesar during the first Gallic Wars (58–50 BC). The treatise was dedicated to Emperor Augustus. As Vitruvius defined the concept in the first chapters of the treatise, he mentioned the three prerequisites of architecture are firmness (\"firmitas\"), commodity (\"utilitas\"), and delight (\"venustas\"), which require the architects to be equipped with a varied kind of learning and knowledge of many branches. Moreover, Vitruvius identified the \"Six Principles of Design\" as order (\"ordinatio\"), arrangement (\"dispositio\"), proportion (\"eurythmia\"), symmetry (\"symmetria\"), propriety (\"decor\") and economy (\"distributio\"). Among the six principles, proportion interrelates and supports all the other factors in geometrical forms and arithmetical ratios.\n\nThe word \"symmetria\", usually translated to \"symmetry\" in modern renderings, in ancient times meant something more closely related to \"mathematical harmony\" and measurable proportions. Vitruvius tried to describe his theory in the makeup of the human body, which he referred to as the perfect or golden ratio. The principles of measurement units digit, foot, and cubit also came from the dimensions of a Vitruvian Man. More specifically, Vitruvius used the total height of 6 feet of a person, and each part of the body takes up a different ratio. For example, the face is about 1/10 of the total height, and the head is about 1/8 of the total height. Vitruvius used these ratios to prove that the composition of classical orders mimicked the human body, thereby ensuring aesthetic harmonization when people viewed architectural columns.\n\nIn classical architecture, the module was established as the radius of the lower shaft of a classical column, with proportions expressed as a fraction or multiple of that module.\n\nIn his \"Le Modulor\" (1948), Le Corbusier presented a system of proportions which took the golden ratio and a man with a raised arm as the scalable modules of proportion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1970118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970118", "title": "Great American Songbook", "text": "Great American Songbook\n\nThe Great American Songbook, also known as \"American Standards\", is the canon of the most important and influential American popular songs and jazz standards from the early 20th century. Although several collections of music have been published under the title, it does not refer to any actual book or specific list of songs, but to a loosely defined set including the most popular and enduring songs from the 1920s to the 1950s that were created for Broadway theatre, musical theatre, and Hollywood musical film. They have been recorded and performed by a large number and wide range of singers, instrumental bands, and jazz musicians. The Great American Songbook comprises standards by George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, and Richard Rodgers, among others.\nAlthough the songs have never gone out of style among traditional and jazz singers and musicians, a renewed popular interest in the Great American Songbook beginning in the 1970s has led a growing number of rock and pop singers to take an interest and issue recordings of them.\n\nThere is no consensus on which songs are in the \"Great American Songbook.\" Several music publishing companies, including Hal Leonard, J. W. Pepper & Son, and Alfred Music, sell music under the name \"Great American Songbook.\" Alfred Music lists the Songbook as its own genre.\n\nMusic critics have attempted to develop a \"canon.\" For example, in Alec Wilder's 1972 study, \"American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950\", the songwriter and critic lists and ranks the artists he believes belong to the Great American Songbook canon. A composer, Wilder emphasized analysis of composers and their creative efforts in this work.\n\nWilder devotes whole chapters to only six composers: Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter and Harold Arlen. Vincent Youmans and Arthur Schwartz share a chapter; Burton Lane, Hugh Martin and Vernon Duke are covered together in another. Wilder uses a chapter to explore songwriters and composers he deemed \"The Great Craftsmen\": Hoagy Carmichael, Walter Donaldson, Harry Warren, Isham Jones, Jimmy McHugh, Duke Ellington, Fred Ahlert, Richard A. Whiting, Ray Noble, John Green, Rube Bloom and Jimmy Van Heusen. He concludes with a catch-all 67-page chapter entitled \"Outstanding Individual Songs: 1920 to 1950,\" which includes additional individual songs which he considers memorable.\n\nFrom some perspectives, the Great American Songbook era ended with the advent of rock and roll; Wilder ends with 1950.\n\nRadio personality and Songbook devotee Jonathan Schwartz has described this genre as \"America's classical music\".\n\nDespite the relatively narrow range of topics and moods dealt with in many of the songs, the best Great American Songbook lyricists specialized in witty, urbane lyrics with teasingly unexpected rhymes. The songwriters combined memorable melodies – which could be anything from pentatonic, as in a Gershwin tune like \"I Got Rhythm\", to sinuously chromatic, as in many of Cole Porter's tunes – and great harmonic subtlety, a good example being Kern's \"All the Things You Are\", with its winding modulations.\n\nMany of the songs in the Great American Songbook were composed for musicals, and some originally included an introductory \"sectional verse\": a musical introduction that typically has a free musical structure, speech-like rhythms, and rubato delivery. The sectional verse served as a way of leading from the surrounding realistic context of the play into the more artificial world of the song, and often has lyrics that are in character and make reference to the plot of the musical for which the song was originally written.\n\nA song's sectional verse, if it exists, is often dropped in performances outside the song's original stage or movie context. Whether or not it is sung often depends on what the song is and who is singing it — for example, Frank Sinatra never recorded \"Fly Me to the Moon\" with the introductory sectional verse, but Nat King Cole did — and a few of the songs written with such an introduction are nearly always performed in full with the introduction.\n\nThe song itself is usually a 32-bar AABA or ABAC form, and the lyrics usually refer to more universal and timeless situations and themes – typically, for instance, the vicissitudes of love. This universality made it easier for songs to be added to or subtracted from a show, or revived in a different show.\n\nThe following writers and songs are often included in the Great American Songbook:\n\n\n\nSince the 1930s, many singers have recorded or performed large parts of the Great American Songbook. Lee Wiley was among the first to record collections of one specific songwriter or songwriting team, beginning with George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin (1939), followed by Cole Porter (1940), Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart (1940), Harold Arlen (1943), Irving Berlin (1951) and Vincent Youmans (1951).\n\nElla Fitzgerald's popular and influential \"Songbook\" series on Verve in the 1950s and 1960s collated 252 songs from the Songbook. These eight collections paid tribute to Cole Porter (1956), Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart (1956), Duke Ellington (1957), Irving Berlin (1958), George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin (1959), Harold Arlen (1961), Jerome Kern (1963) and Johnny Mercer (1964).\n\nOther influential early interpreters of the Great American Songbook include Louis Armstrong, Fred Astaire, Mildred Bailey, Chet Baker, Tony Bennett, June Christy, Rosemary Clooney, Nat \"King\" Cole, Perry Como, Barbara Cook, Jane Froman, Chris Connor, Bing Crosby, Vic Damone, Bobby Darin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Doris Day, Blossom Dearie, Billy Eckstine, Alice Faye, Helen Forrest, the Four Freshmen, Connie Francis, Judy Garland, Eydie Gorme, Johnny Hartman, Dick Haymes, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne, Joni James, Jack Jones, Al Jolson, Bill Kenny, Cleo Laine, Frankie Laine, Steve Lawrence, Peggy Lee, Julie London, Dean Martin, Tony Martin, Johnny Mathis, Carmen McRae, Mabel Mercer, Margaret Whiting Helen Merrill, Anita O'Day, Patti Page, Dinah Shore, Bobby Short, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra, Keely Smith, Kay Starr, Jo Stafford, Barbra Streisand (particularly in her earlier work), Maxine Sullivan, Mel Tormé, Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Ethel Waters, Margaret Whiting, Andy Williams, Joe Williams and Nancy Wilson.\n\nSince the late 20th century, there has been a revival of the Great American Songbook by contemporary singers.\n\nIn 1970, Ringo Starr, independently of the Beatles, released \"Sentimental Journey\", an album of 12 standards arranged by various musicians. In 1973, Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson released a critically well-received album of 12 classic standards, \"A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night\", arranged by Gordon Jenkins. The album was re-issued on CD in 1988 with a total of 18 standards sung by Nilsson. Also in 1973, Bryan Ferry, of Roxy Music fame, released \"These Foolish Things\", and he has subsequently recorded several such albums. In 1978, country singer Willie Nelson released a collection of popular standards titled \"Stardust\". This was considered risky at the time but the album has become the best-selling and perhaps the most enduring of Nelson's career, leading to several other Great American Songbook albums over the years.\n\nIn 1983, popular rock vocalist Linda Ronstadt released \"What's New\", her first in a trilogy of standards albums recorded with arranger/conductor Nelson Riddle. Stephen Holden of the \"New York Times\" wrote:\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Michael Feinstein was a nationally known cabaret singer-pianist famed for being a dedicated proponent of the Great American Songbook. In 2007 he founded the Great American Songbook Foundation, to preserve and promote the songs and their legacy.\n\nIn 1991, Natalie Cole released a highly successful album \"Unforgettable... with Love\", which spawned a Top 40 hit \"Unforgettable\", a virtual \"duet\" with her father, Nat \"King\" Cole. Follow-up albums such as \"Take a Look\" were also successful.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, additional vocalists such as Harry Connick, Jr., Michael Bublé, Diana Krall, Karrin Allyson, and Susannah McCorkle have been notable interpreters of the Songbook throughout their careers. Michael Feinstein in particular has been a dedicated proponent, archivist, revivalist and preservationist of the material since the late 1970s.\n\nSince 1980, singers in other genres have recorded songs from the Great American Songbook. Beginning in 2002, Rod Stewart has devoted a series of studio albums to Songbook covers: \"\" (2002), \"\" (2003), \"\" (2004), \"\" (2005), and \"Fly Me to the Moon... The Great American Songbook Volume V\" (2009).\n\nOther rock and pop artists who have used the work include Cher, Keith Richards, Carly Simon, Bette Midler, Gloria Estefan, Barry Manilow, Caetano Veloso, Pia Zadora, Queen Latifah, Joni Mitchell, Boz Scaggs, Robbie Williams, Sting, Tom Waits, Ray Reach, Pat Benatar, Morrissey, Norah Jones, Nicole Henry and Rufus Wainwright.\n\nIn 2010, Brian Wilson released his own take on Gershwin classics with \"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\". In 2012, Sir Paul McCartney joined this list with the album \"Kisses on the Bottom\". John Stevens, a 2004 \"American Idol\" contestant, also recorded these songs. Steve Tyrell has forged a successful solo career with his interpretations of songs from the Great American Songbook. His version of \"The Way You Look Tonight\" for \"Father of the Bride\" (1991) was noticed and kept in the film at the insistence of its star, Steve Martin; this led to Tyrell recording several Songbook albums, including \"A New Standard\", \"Standard Time\" and \"Bach to Bacharach\". In 2014, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett released a collaborative album, \"Cheek to Cheek\", made up of songs from the Great American Songbook. Bob Dylan released the albums \"Shadows in the Night\" (2015), \"Fallen Angels\" (2016), and \"Triplicate\" (2017), all albums of Great American Songbook selections. Kristin Chenoweth recorded a selection of songs from the Great American Songbook for her sixth album, \"The Art of Elegance\", in 2016.\n\nBritish broadcaster Michael Parkinson devoted a considerable part of his BBC Radio 2 programme \"Parkinson's Sunday Supplement\", which aired from 1996 to 2007, to this genre of music.\n\n\n\n"}

She is the 1997 U.S. national all-around champion, the 1998 Goodwill Games gold medalist on the floor exercise and vault, a four-time national champion in the individual events of vault, balance beam, and floor exercise, and a five-time World Cup champion. She is also the 1996 junior national all-around and floor champion. At the 1999 American Cup, Atler became the first female gymnast to successfully perform a Rudi vault.\n\nA member of the U.S. national gymnastics team from the age of 12, Atler was one of America's most successful and talented gymnasts in the late 1990s. Known for her explosive vaults, difficult tumbling skills and charismatic personality, she won or medaled in several important meets, and was considered to be one of the front-runners for the 2000 Olympics. However, injuries, coaching conflicts, gym changes, mental breakdowns and bulimia symptoms derailed her progress in 1999 and 2000, and after a poor showing at the 2000 Olympic Trials, she was controversially left off the Olympic team despite placing sixth overall.\n\nAtler was born on February 17, 1982 in Valencia, California, and began gymnastics at age 5. She has a brother who played baseball, her mother was a tennis instructor, and one of her cousins had been a Minnesota Vikings quarterback. At age 11, she began training at Charter Oak Gliders in Covina, California, and was coached by Beth Kline-Rybacki and Steve Rybacki. By the time she was 12 years old, she was competing at the elite level.\n\nAs a junior elite gymnast, Atler had a fruitful career. In 1995, she gained attention by placing third in the all-around, behind Olympian Kerri Strug and Heather Brink, at the U.S. Olympic Festival. She also won a gold medal on beam and a silver medal on floor. She went on to win the silver medal in the all-around at that year's U.S. National Championships.\n\nAtler also made her international competitive debut in 1995, winning the floor exercise title at the prestigious International Junior Gymnastics Competition in Japan. \n\nIn February, Atler won the junior all-around title at the American Classic. In June at the U.S. National Championships, she became the junior national champion in the all-around and the floor exercise. She was invited to participate in a televised exhibition meet, \"USA vs. the World,\" with members of the Magnificent Seven and international Olympians.\n\nWith her February 1982 birth date, Atler missed the age cutoff for senior competition—which would have given her a chance to compete for a spot on the 1996 Olympic team—by only six weeks. In 1997, she found herself shut out of senior international competition once again, as the FIG raised the age limit from fifteen to sixteen.\n\nAtler competed well in 1997, participating in both junior events and senior meets that were not bound by the FIG's new age restrictions. She placed second all-around at the 1997 American Cup and won event titles on vault and beam. In August at the 1997 U.S. National Championships, she won the national all-around title in a tie with Kristy Powell. At that same competition, she also won the vault title and the bronze medal on uneven bars. She went on to win the all-around title at the 1997 Canberra Cup in Australia, an important meet for junior international gymnasts.\n\nDuring that same year, Atler began to experience problems on the uneven bars. On the second day of U.S. Nationals, a fall from bars kept her from winning the all-around title outright. This marked the beginning of a string of competitions in which she suffered unusual mistakes and misses on bars. In her online diary, she once referred to the bars as \"the devil--testing my will and my patience, even my love for the sport.\" Over the next few years, bars would become a mental block for the young athlete who regularly struggled to put together a mistake-free routine in the heat of competition. Atler's main issue on bars involved a release move called a Comaneci salto, which she fell on at three consecutive National Championships from 1997-1999. This led to persistent questioning as to whether the Comaneci should have been removed from her bar routine despite the fact that she did complete the skill successfully on occasion.\n\nIn 1998, Atler was finally age-eligible for major senior international competition. In March at the American Cup, a fall from bars cost her the all-around title and she placed fourth all-around. In event finals at the same competition, she won the vault title and placed third on bars with a hit routine.\n\nIn July at the 1998 Goodwill Games, Atler was chosen to compete on floor exercise and vault, her two strongest apparatus. She won the gold medal on both events, defeating a field of Olympic and World medalists. In August at the 1998 U.S. National Championships, she won the all-around silver medal, as well as the gold medal on floor and the silver medal on vault. A disastrous 8.225 on bars during the first night of competition cost her a chance to defend her all-around title, but she rebounded well on the second day and received a 9.8 for her hit bar routine.\n\nIn November, Atler won the Australia Cup all-around title with a strong performance on every event. She also won the vault and floor titles. In December, she continued to gain momentum at the 1998 Copa Gimnastica competition in Mexico City, where she once again delivered strong routines on all four events and won the all-around bronze medal in a deep field behind Viktoria Karpenko and Simona Amânar. She also won the gold medal on vault, defeating Amanar, just as she had done at the Goodwill Games.\n\nAtler began her 1999 season in February with a strong showing at the American Classic, where she won the all-around title by a large margin with top quality routines on every apparatus. In March at the American Cup, she became the first American woman to successfully complete a Rudi vault in competition. She won the event title on that event, as well as the beam and floor titles. Despite falling off bars in Preliminaries, she placed first all-around in that round of competition. During Finals, her routines were extremely strong on three events, but she fell off bars once again, which cost her the title and dropped her to third all-around.. \n\nShortly thereafter, at the Paris-Bercy competition in France, Atler won the silver medal in a strong all-around field behind Svetlana Khorkina and also won the vault gold medal. During the floor exercise event final, she severely injured her ankle when she landed her double layout-punch front opening tumbling pass out-of-bounds. The out-of-bounds area of this particular floor mat lacked the proper spring and safety protection required. Atler recovered in time to compete at the 1999 U.S. National Championships, where she won the silver medal in the all-around behind Kristen Maloney. She was leading the competition going into the final rotation, but a fall from bars cost her the title. She went on to win the gold medal on vault and beam in Event Finals.\n\nFollowing the U.S. National Championships, Atler left her longtime coaches at Charter Oak gymnastics club, Steve and Beth Rybacki. She was coached by Artur Akopyan at a local California gym as she prepared to compete at the U.S. World Team Trials and World Championships. She was, however, too injured to compete at the World Team Trials, and was petitioned onto the team based on the strength of her scores at 1999 Nationals, alongside Kristen Maloney and Jennie Thompson who were also suffering from injuries. \n\nIn October at the 1999 World Championships in Tianjin, China, Atler was out of competitive shape and unprepared for the competition, but she still did well enough to qualify to the All-Around Final in 7th place, the top U.S. qualifier. She also qualified for the Floor Final and was to replace Kristen Maloney (who pulled out of the final due to an injury) in the Beam Final. In the Team Final, she had some uncharacteristic errors and scored an 8.025 on beam after counting two falls. Struggling with her ankle injury that was progressively getting worse, she placed 31st in the all-around after ending her floor routine with a basic layout tumbling pass. She then withdrew from both of her event finals. \n\nAfter the 1999 World Championships, Atler had two surgeries to repair the injured ankle that had plagued her throughout most of 1999. During that same time, she moved from California to Texas to train with 1988 Olympic champion Valeri Liukin at the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy (WOGA).\n\nIn 2000 after her injury layoff, Atler returned to form in July at the U.S. Classic, where she won the all-around title. Later that month at the 2000 U.S. National Championships, she finished fourth in the all-around, a respectable finish after a lengthy injury recovery, which set her up well for an Olympic berth. She also won the silver medal on vault and the bronze medal on floor. \n\nAt the 2000 Olympic Trials a few weeks later, Atler experienced what many considered a meltdown. She was unable to hit even one solid routine over the two days of competition, and botched moves that she usually performed well, changing her second vault in mid-air during both days, modifying her second tumbling pass on floor during the first day, and falling on her back on her beam dismount during the first day. As a result, the Olympic Selection Committee opted to leave her completely off the U.S. Olympic Team. However, even with several significant mistakes, Atler managed to place sixth at Trials and was still widely regarded as one of the United States's best gymnasts, causing some to argue that she had earned a spot on the team and to question the fairness of the selection process. Six athletes were named to the team as well as two alternates.\n\nAtler participated in the T.J. Maxx post-Olympics exhibition tour. In 2001, she trained briefly at Rohnert Park Gymnastics, but announced her retirement in April. In 2005, she appeared on the television show \"Starting Over,\" where she discussed some of the self-esteem and confidence issues that had arisen from her struggles in gymnastics. In multiple interviews in subsequent years, Atler expressed regret over leaving the Rybackis in 1999 and over not having better communication with them during that time. She returned to them in 2003 in a brief attempt at a comeback.\n\nAtler now works as a coach and is the girls team director at American Kids Sports Center in Bakersfield, California. She is married and has two children, a son born in January 2014 and a daughter born in February 2018.\n\nVault: Laidout Rudi (first American female ever to compete this); Double Twisting Yurchenko; Laidout Cuervo; Handspring Laidout Front.\n\nFloor: Double Layout + Punch Front + Stag Jump in combination; Whip + Double Pike; Triple Twist; Whip Half + Front Layout Double Full; Double Front Tuck; Two and a Half Twist + Front Layout; Full-twisting Double Tuck.\n\nHer floor music pieces were: \"Phil's Piano Solo\" by Terry Snyder in 1995 and 1996; Jack's Conga by Micheal Kamen in 1997 and 1998; La Cumparsita by Gerardo Matos Rodriguez in 1998 and 1999; and Les Deux Guitares by Paul Mauriat in 2000.\n\nBalance Beam: Punch Front + Jump mount sequence; Layout to two feet; Switch Leap + Gainered Layout in combination; Piked Front + Jump in combination; Tucked Barani; Roundoff + Back Handspring + Double Tuck Dismount.\n\nUneven Bars: Giant One and a Half; Tkatchev; Comaneci Salto; Pak Salto; Full Twisting Double Layout Dismount.\n\nAtler was a stunt double for the Lifetime Television film \"Little Girls in Pretty Boxes\" in 1997. She also appeared in commercials for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups in 1999 and for the U.S Olympic Committee in 2000, in the \"Starting Over\" TV series in 2005 as well as in various made-for-TV gymnastics exhibitions such as the Reese's Cup in 1999 and 2000, the Rock'n'Roll Championships in 1997 and 1998 and \"USA vs The World\" in 1996.\n\n"}
{"id": "1970126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970126", "title": "Gun truck", "text": "Gun truck\n\nA gun truck is an armored vehicle with \none or more crew-served weapons used by units of regular armies or other official government armed forces to escort military convoys in regions subject to ambush by guerrilla forces, defend airfields, provide perimeter defense, or serve as mobile pillboxes for Home Guard-type defensive units. Gun trucks typically have Improvised vehicle armor, such as scrap metal, concrete, gravel, or sandbags, which is added to a heavy truck.\n\nWhen the prospect of a German invasion of the United Kingdom seemed likely, the British Army designed and built an improvised armored vehicle, the Bedford OXA. It was based on the one and a half-ton OXD truck and was upgraded with armor plate, and armed with a .55 in anti-tank rifle and a Bren gun. Slightly less than a thousand were built by 1941, and they were employed by the British Home Guard.\n\nOther British examples from the invasion-scare period were the Armadillo armoured fighting vehicle and the Bison concrete armoured lorries. Both were conventional trucks fitted with improvised armour, in the case of the Bison, a concrete fighting-compartment was carried, essentially making a mobile pillbox. The Armadillo used two walls of wood, with the space between filled with gravel. Both vehicles had poor mobility and were employed for airfield defense by the Royal Air Force.\nIn the event of a surprise, airborne attack, Bisons would deploy a short distance to the key points of the airfield and probably fight from static positions, positions where fixed defenses often could not be constructed as they would impede aircraft movement during day–to–day operations. The Armadillo's mobility, while poor, was better than the Bison's and it was intended they would take on a mobile role similar to a conventional armoured vehicle.<ref name = \"NA AIR 2/7212\" >The National Archives: AIR 2/7212 Armadillos: improved fighting vehicles for airfield defence</ref>\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, it was the mission of the US Army Transportation Corps to ferry supplies from the coastal ports of Qui Nhon and Cam Ranh Bay to inland bases located at Bong Son, An Khe, Pleiku, Da Lat, and Buon Ma Thuot. The logistical requirements of the MACV were huge, and 200-truck convoys were not uncommon. These formations were tempting targets for Viet Cong guerrilla groups, who often sprung ambushes in remote areas.\n\nOne unit that often fell victim to such attacks was the 8th Transportation Group, based in Qui Nhon. Two dangerous stretches of Route 19 between Qui Nhon and Pleiku became the enemy's favorite kill zones, the \"Devil's Hairpin\" in An Khe Pass and \"Ambush Alley\" below Mang Giang Pass as incidents occurred there on an almost daily basis.\n\nProviding security for convoys proved virtually impossible, as the Military Police units whose task it was did not have the manpower or equipment to secure the whole highway. Other military combat units only controlled the stretch of road within their designated checkpoints and could serve as a reaction force; so for much of the way, it fell onto the transport units to provide themselves immediate security. At first, they did this with armed jeeps, but these rapidly proved inadequate in the face of improved Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army weaponry and tactics.\n\nOn September 2, 1967, a particularly devastating attack killed seven drivers, wounded 17 and destroyed or damaged 30 trucks. To remedy the obvious vulnerability of the supply convoys, a \"hardened convoy\" concept was implemented, protected by a new type of security vehicle. This gun truck, as it became known, was based on the two-and-a-half-ton cargo truck, protected by a barrier of sandbags, and armed with two M60 machine guns. Hardened convoys were smaller than previously, being composed of only 100 trucks, and their security detail was increased until there was one gun truck for every 10 transport trucks.\n\nIn the event of an ambush, their role was to drive into the kill zone during the first few minutes of the attack, and saturate the attackers with their firepower. Early designs proved flawed, as the sandbag protections quickly became waterlogged in the frequent rains, weighing down the whole vehicle. They were later replaced with ad hoc steel armor plating, salvaged from scrap yards. The crew consisted of a driver, two gunners, a non-commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC), and sometimes a grenadier armed with an M79 grenade launcher. In October 1968, the factory-made hardening kits arrived to replace the sandbag and wood gun trucks.\nOn November 24, 1967, during an engagement in \"Ambush Alley\", a group of gun trucks managed to thwart an ambush. The convoy lost six transport trucks and four gun trucks damaged or destroyed, and several drivers were killed and wounded, but the Viet Cong lost 41 KIA and were forced to withdraw. This was the first ambush against gun trucks.\n\nDespite the increased security, transportation units still came under attack, forcing the gun truck units to improve the design of their vehicles. The two-and-a-half-ton trucks were underpowered, and the addition of armor and weapons slowed them down, leading to their replacement by five-ton cargo trucks that formed the basis for larger gun trucks. The improvised nature of these vehicles meant they varied considerably in appearance. They were given colourful nicknames such as \"Deuce is Wild,\" \"Cold Sweat\",\" \"Iron Butterfly\" or \"Pandemonium\" that were often painted on the sides in large letters.\n\nTheir armament consisted of various combinations of weapons including M60s, .50-calibre machine guns, and XM 134 miniguns. Anti-aircraft weapons such as the quadmount .50 cal. machine guns were also used until 1969 when the truck companies had three to six gun trucks each.\n\nThe gun truck design evolved with a four-sided gun box bolted on the outside of the truck bed, then an inner steel wall was added, with a space between each layer, to provide protection against anti-tank rockets. Because of the shortage of steel kits, the M113 armoured personnel carrier hulls were mounted on the bed of a five-ton truck, thus providing all-round protection for the crew. The last design of gun box had the steel wall mounted inside the bed of the truck instead of outside. Despite their aggressive names, gun trucks were strictly defensive weapons, being used only for convoy escort and perimeter defense duties.\n\nGun trucks suffered from several drawbacks. The added weight of armour, weapons and ammunition increased fuel consumption, as well as creating maintenance problems and reducing the durability of the truck frames. Also, the personnel assigned as crew to the security vehicles were no longer available for transport duties, thus reducing the lift capacity of each unit. Despite this, they were generally regarded as a success.\n\nIn all, an estimated 300 to 400 trucks were transformed in this way. Senior officers saw the 5-ton gun truck as a temporary solution until enough V-100 armored cars arrived. However, by 1970 it became obvious to all - except the Military Police - that the V-100 was a death trap if the armor was penetrated. Furthermore, the V-100 had problems with its power train. So the gun trucks continued to serve until the last American truck company was inactivated in Vietnam in 1972. With the end of the Vietnam War, the need for such vehicles disappeared and most were either scrapped or returned to cargo carrying. One truck, an M54 named by its crew \"Eve of Destruction,\" was brought back intact and is on display at the Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis, Virginia.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, the vulnerability of American supply convoys became apparent as soon as March 2003, when a maintenance unit was ambushed in Nasiriyah, losing eleven soldiers killed and five taken prisoner, including Pfc. Jessica Lynch. Not until June 2003 during the post-invasion phase of the war, did the Iraqi insurgents begin attacking convoys with regularity, which led to the re-invention of the gun truck. The truck units initially used sandbags and plywood as outlined in FM 55-30, but experienced the same problems as the Vietnam veterans. They then scrounged through scrap piles for steel plates until HARDOX and ARMOX steel plates began to arrive in quantity by September. By definition a gun truck was any wheeled vehicle with a crew-served weapon regardless of whether it had any armor or not. Initially, the truck drivers mounted armor and machineguns on any and every wheeled vehicle in their inventory but settled on two primary platforms, the M939 five-ton truck and the HMMWV. The Palletized Load Systems were also converted to gun trucks more because fully loaded with cargo they could not keep up with the other trucks. The minimum requirement for gun truck escort was two gun trucks and each unit experimented with different gun truck designs and procedures.\n\nOn April 5, 2004, the radical young cleric Muqtadā al-Ṣadr called for a jihad against coalition forces and beginning on Thursday night, April 8, his Mahdi Militia dropped eight bridges and overpasses around the Convoy Support Center Scania, thus severing the supply line from the south, and then began large scale ambushes. Up until that night, the ambushes involved no more than seven ambushers with kill zones no larger than 100 meters. The next day the Militia ambushed any convoy heading into or out of Baghdad International Airport with kill zones several hundred meters long. The worst ambush killed eight KBR drivers and three US Army drivers of the 724th Transportation Company. Matt Maupin was listed as the only American soldier missing in action for several years until his body was finally discovered. After that, Brigadier General James Chambers, Commander of the 13th Corps Support Command, standardized the ratio of gun trucks per convoy and convoys should not exceed 30 vehicles.\n\nIn April 2004, Leaders of the US Army Reserve 375th Transportation Group and the 812th Transportation Battalion formed a special provisional unit - the 518th Transportation Company called \"Gun Truck\" Company. Based in Camp Navistar (located on the Kuwait side of the border Near Safwan, Iraq), this company acquired 35 humvees and five M939 five-ton trucks, and modified them with improvised armor and .50 calibre machine-guns. With many Reserve and National Guard combat arms units already converting and performing Convoy Security Escort service while deployed to Iraq, the need for a special Gun Truck unit proved unfeasible and the unit disbanded in April, 2005.\n\nThe use of improvised fighting vehicles, protected by the so-called \"Hillbilly armor\", quickly became a political issue, with the Bush administration coming under criticism for having sent the U.S. military to fight without adequate equipment. The idea of producing a standardised gun truck was instigated by Representative Duncan Hunter (R.-Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, despite the reluctance of some Army superior officers.\n\nDeveloped with the help of Vietnam veterans by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the resulting armored box (dubbed the \"Hunter box\") was intended for use on five-ton trucks. Their armor protection was composed of high-grade steel plating, fiberglass and ballistic glass, while the armament consisted of two to four heavy machine-guns.\n\nThe first prototype was completed in March 2004, and shipped to Iraq in July 2004, after which production began at a slow rate, with 35 units in service by July 2005. As of September 2007, a total of 100 kits had been produced for Iraq, and 18 for use in Afghanistan. The \"Hunter boxes\" apparently proved popular with U.S. troops, but were criticized by senior officers for their lack of overhead protection, and for being top-heavy. However, few cases exist to prove their doubts in this equipment.\n\nFully armored M1114s and factory-built add-on-armor kits for the Humvee gun truck were arriving in quantity by the end of 2004, and the cab armor kits for fleet of 5-ton trucks, M915 tractors and Heavy Equipment Transport Systems began arriving the next year. Priority of the M1114s went to Iraq-based escort units while the Kuwait-based truck companies that had to drive all across Iraq received the add-on-armor kits until more M1114s arrived. The soldiers appreciated the much needed armored protection but the extra weight of the add-on-armor kits slowed the Humvee's acceleration and speed substantially. The suspension and power train wore out quickly. The modified heavier vehicle's sluggishness could not match the manoeuvre capabilities of the insurgent vehicles. By the Palm Sunday Ambush on March 20, 2005, all vehicles on the road had some form of armor whether improvised or factory built. After suffering high losses during this ambush, with no Americans killed, the insurgents turned to IEDs as their primary weapon of choice.\n\nThe appearance of the explosively formed projectile required additional fragmentary armor added to the M1114s, which over-taxed their power trains and suspension systems. The improved M1151 Up-armored HMMWV became the escort platform of choice along with the 5-ton gun trucks until the MRAPs began replacing them in 2008. The Heavy Equipment Transporter proved to be the most survivable vehicle on the road because of its height, so Kuwait-based units began sending them out ahead of the convoy looking for IEDs.\n\nThe Army Transportation Museum preserved several examples of Iraq and Afghanistan gun trucks. It has a Hill Billy armor 5-ton gun truck from Iraq, HMMWV with prototype add-on-armor kit, M1114 that survived an IED blast in Afghanistan, a LLNL 5-ton gun truck \"Ace of Spades\" from Iraq, two MRAPs, a M915 and Heavy Equipment Transporter with cab armor kits from Iraq, and a \"Frankenstein\" cab armor kit for the M939 5-ton truck. The Airman Heritage Museum also preserved a Hill Billy armor 5-ton gun truck from Iraq. The 1st Cavalry Museum brought back the last MRAP of the last convoy to cross the border from Iraq.\n\nColombian Army have several guns trucks based con M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck, locally named as \"Meteoro\", are trucks with indigenous armour and two M2 heavy machine guns. Other models of trucks are modified to similar specification. These gun trucks are used for convoy protection and checkpoints against the guerrillas.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1970169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970169", "title": "Kabir Ali", "text": "Kabir Ali\n\nKabir Ali (born 24 November 1980) is an English former cricketer. He is of Pakistani Punjabi descent. He last played for Lancashire in the English County Championship. A right-arm seam bowler and useful lower-order right-handed batsman, outside cricket he works as a model. He is the first cousin of cricketers Kadeer Ali and Moeen Ali, both of whom used to play alongside Kabir for Worcestershire. In May 2015 he announced his retirement from cricket due to ongoing injuries.\n\nAfter serving his apprenticeship in Worcestershire's Second XI and for the county's Board XI in the 38-County Cup for a couple of years, Kabir Ali made his first-class debut in a drawn game against Middlesex in September 1999. He bowled respectably enough, taking 2–36 and 1–22, but the match's lateness in the season robbed him of the chance to push for a regular place in the first team. Despite several appearances in the Benson & Hedges Cup in April 2000, including an impressive 4–29 on List A debut, Kabir spent most of the first part of that season still in the second team, although by the summer he had pushed his way into the full XI. Also in 2000, Kabir was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award for the most promising young Worcestershire player.\n\nOver the following few years, Kabir gradually established himself as a hard-working bowler who was dedicated to his craft. His best period to date has been 2002-3; he took 138 first-class wickets in those two English seasons, including eight five-wicket innings hauls. International recognition first came during the 2002-3 winter, when he was invited to tour Australia with the ECB National Academy. It was thus unsurprising that he was selected to play for England in 2003, making his One Day International debut against Zimbabwe that July – although the game was a washout and Kabir had no chance to make an impression.\n\nHe was also selected for the Fourth Test against South Africa at Headingley in August 2003, taking a wicket in his first over (Neil McKenzie, caught behind by Alec Stewart off Kabir's fifth ball). He took five wickets in the match: 3–80 in the first innings and 2–56 in the second, including the key wicket of Gary Kirsten (for 130 and 60) in both innings. Nonetheless, England were soundly beaten and the selectors rang the changes, bringing in Steve Harmison and Ashley Giles for Kabir and James Kirtley. The Headingley match was Kabir's solitary Test appearance, although he made a number of further appearances at ODI level. His greatest success came against South Africa in 2004/05, when he took more wickets (13) than any other England bowler, and at Bloemfontein somehow conjured a tie from nowhere.\n\nKabir first came to national prominence when he took a second-innings 5–48 (and eight wickets in the match) against the touring Zimbabwe side in May 2003; in a precursor to his final-over heroics at Bloemfontein, Kabir claimed the final two wickets with the scores level to tie the match. Kabir's life was touched by tragedy in July 2003, when his two-week-old nephew died. However, his father wished him to play for Worcestershire against Derbyshire a few days later, and he put in a magnificent display. After a quiet first innings with the ball, he scored a quickfire 68, putting on 104 with Steve Rhodes for the eighth wicket to help rescue his team from deep trouble at 190/7, and then ripped through the Derbyshire batting line-up to take 8–53, at the time the best innings analysis of his career. Thanks to Kabir's heroics, Worcestershire won the game by an innings. Kabir further demonstrated his batting credentials in September 2003, hitting 92 from 93 balls in a 45-over National Cricket League match against Essex, his maiden limited-overs fifty.\n\nThe 2004 season began frustratingly for Kabir, as injury prevented him from playing until the end of May. However, some good performances in midsummer brought him a place in the squad for the Champions Trophy tournament in September, and he retained his place for the winter tour of South Africa (see above). Kabir's performances in early 2005 were unspectacular, but nevertheless he was named in the 14-man squad for that summer's triangular one-day series with Australia and Bangladesh. He played in none of the games, however, and was replaced by Matt Prior for the three-game ODI series against Australia which immediately followed.\n\nKabir was not in England contention during the 2006 season, and for the winter of 2006–07 he turned out for Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy along with teammate Vikram Solanki. Worcestershire's 2007 season began poorly, but Kabir claimed a career-best 8–50 in a rain-affected match against Lancashire in May. These were the best figures at Old Trafford for 13 years. On 15 August 2009 Hampshire confirmed they had signed Ali on a 3-year deal, subject to resolving Worcestershires demands for compensation of £60,000. Hampshire were not willing to meet Worcestershire's demands for compensation, making it seem as if Ali would have to honour the remaining year on his Worcestershire contract. In January 2010 Ali's dispute with Worcestershire was intensified, with Ali failing to report for pre-season training.\n\nAli was released from his contract at Worcestershire on 21 January 2010. It is widely expected that Ali will take up the three-year contract he had agreed with Hampshire in 2009. The following day Ali confirmed he had joined Hampshire, signing a three-year contract at the Rose Bowl.\n\nKabir Ali joined Barisal Burners of the Bangladesh Premier League, a Bangladeshi Twenty20 league, in February 2012.\n\nOn 2 November 2012, Kabir Ali joined newly relegated Lancashire on a two-year contract. Kadir became an integral part of Lancashire's march straight back to the county top flight. He was often the death bowler in t20 games for the side, usually bowling the 18th and 20th overs, limiting batsmen and picking up useful wickets.\n\n"}

It is native to rivers and lakes in northern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan, but has also been introduced elsewhere in South Asia and is commonly farmed.\n\nIn Nepal and in neighbouring Indian regions up to Odisha, it is called Bhakura.\n\nCatla is a fish with large and broad head, a large protruding lower jaw, and upturned mouth. It has large, greyish scales on its dorsal side and whitish on its belly. It reaches up to in length and in weight.\n\nCatla is a surface and midwater feeder. Adults feed on zooplankton using large gill rakers, but young ones on both zooplankton and phytoplankton. Catla attains sexual maturity at an average age of two years and an average weight of 2 kg.\n\nThe catla was formerly listed as the only species in the genus \"Catla\", but this was a synonym of the genus \"Gibelion\". More recently, Catalog of Fishes has moved this species to \"Labeo\". This species has been frequently confused with the giant barb (\"Catlocarpio siamensis\") of south-east Asia, and the two taxa do bear an extraordinary resemblance to each other, especially in their very large heads.\n\nIt is one of the most important aquacultured freshwater species in South Asia.\nIt is grown in polyculture ponds with other carp-like fishes, particularly with the roho labeo (\"Labeo rohita)\" and mrigal carp. The reported production numbers have increased sharply during the 2000s, and were in 2012 about 2.8 million tonnes per year.\n\nCatla is sold and consumed fresh, locally and regionally. It is transported on ice. Fish of 1–2 kg weight are preferred by the consumers.\n\n"}

Begun in 1915 and not opened until 1925, it is considered one of the last great Gothic buildings to be built in England.\n\nSituated near the top of Park Street on Queens Road in Bristol, United Kingdom, it is a landmark building of the University of Bristol that currently houses the School of Law and the Department of Earth Sciences, as well as the Law and Earth Sciences libraries. It is the third highest structure in Bristol, standing at .\n\nMany regard the building as synonymous with the University of Bristol. It is the centrepiece building of the university precinct and is used by the University of Bristol for degree ceremonies and examinations, which take place in the Great Hall.\n\nArchitecture commentator Nikolaus Pevsner described it as:\n\nIt has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building and serves as a regional European Documentation Centre.\n\nThe Wills Memorial Building was commissioned in 1912 by George Alfred Wills and Henry Herbert Wills, the magnates of the Bristol tobacco company W. D. & H. O. Wills, in honour of their father, Henry Overton Wills III, benefactor and first Chancellor of the University who donated £100,000 to the University. Sir George Oatley, who also worked on a number of other buildings for the University, was chosen as architect and told to \"build to last\". He produced a design in the Perpendicular Gothic style, to evoke the famous university buildings of Oxford and Cambridge. The building was funded through the fortunes which the Wills family made through tobacco\nOatley later claimed that his inspiration for the building came from a dream where he saw a tower on a hill with shields around it.\n\nConstruction was started in 1915 but was halted in 1916 due to the continuation of World War I. Building was restarted in 1919, and the Wills Memorial Building was finally opened on 9 June 1925 by King George V and Queen Mary, having cost a total of £501,566 19s 10d. The building was opened with a Royal Salute of 21 chimes from 'Great George', the nine and a half ton bell within the octagonal belfry of the tower, which is tolled on the death of a monarch or chancellor. To celebrate the Centenary of the University receiving its charter, 'Great George' was rung, along with bells in Bristol's other churches, just as they did in May 1909 when King Edward VII granted the University its Royal Charter to grant degrees. Oatley received a knighthood that same year in recognition of his work on the building.\n\nIn 1940, during the Bristol Blitz of World War II, the Great Hall with its Hammerbeam roof was badly damaged by a German bomb-blast. It was restored in the 1960s to Oatley's original design: at the same time the adjoining wing was enlarged by Ralph Brentnall.\n\nThe alleged connection of the Wills family to historical slavery via the U.S. tobacco industry attracted controversy in the 2010s, with some students petitioning the University of Bristol to rename the building in March 2017. In 2018, the University published a response and consultation on how to address the issue, including (amongst others) the suggestion of renaming University buildings and changing the crest.\n\nThe building's dominant feature is Wills Tower. The tower is reinforced concrete faced with Bath and Clipsham stone, with carving designed in collaboration with Jean Hahn of King's Heath Guild, Birmingham.\nAt high it is over twice the height of nearby Cabot Tower. It is 16 metres square and ornamented with heraldic shields.\n\nIt is topped by an octagonal lantern which houses Great George (England's sixth-largest bell, weighing over 9.5 tonnes) which strikes on the hour.\n\nIn addition to the Great Hall there is a General Library, Reception Room and Council Chamber and another 50 rooms including some teaching space such as seminar rooms and lecture theatres. In the Entrance Hall are two ceremonial staircases. The building is also used as a conference venue.\n\nIn 2006, cleaning work began on the Wills Memorial Building costing £750,000. Cleaning on the building revealed the engraving \"IO TRIVMPHE\" intended as a tribute to the architect of the building Sir George Oatley. The engraving had remained hidden for over 80 years and recognises the role of Sir Isambard Owen (then Vice-Chancellor) in the realisation of Oatley's plans. Harry Patch, World War I veteran who also worked on the building, re-unveiled the now clean building.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released for PlayStation, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo 64. Announced shortly after Core became a star developer through the critical and commercial success of \"Tomb Raider\", \"Fighting Force\" was highly anticipated but met with mixed reviews.\n\nPlayers control one of four characters as they move through urban and science fiction environments, battling waves of oncoming enemies with weapons including soda cans, knives, cars, and guns. The player can make some choices as to which territory to travel through.\n\nThe four characters have various reasons for taking on Dr. Dex Zeng, a criminal mastermind with an army at his command who predicted that the world would end in the year 2000. After New Year's Eve 1999, Dr. Zeng believed that there was an error preventing the apocalypse, so decides to correct it by destroying the world himself. The action starts with a police cordon around Zeng's office skyscraper, moving to such locales as a shopping mall, subway and Coast Guard base before finally ending at the top of Zeng's island headquarters.\n\nPlayers choose from a selection of four characters: Hawk Manson, Ben \"Smasher\" Jackson, Mace Daniels, and Alana McKendricks. Hawk Manson and Mace Daniels are two all-around characters. Hawk is somewhat stronger than Mace who is in turn faster than Hawk. Ben \"Smasher\" Jackson is a large and slow bruiser capable of lifting and throwing the engines of cars at enemies. Alana McKendricks is a fast but soft-hitting teenager with an effective jump-kick. All four characters have a special move that can be performed with the loss of a portion of health.\n\nCore Design collaborated with ten coders from EA Japan in making the game.\n\nThe story line and character designs were done by Marc Silvestri. The character of Dr. Zeng was inspired by Heaven's Gate.\n\nCore Design originally pitched the game to Sega as a potential fourth entry in Sega's \"Streets of Rage\" series. Sega declined; according to Core, Sega explained that it had its own plans for continuing the series. Core opted to go ahead with the game as a standalone, multi-platform title, and started work on it. In addition to the PlayStation, Windows, and Nintendo 64 versions, a Sega Saturn version was developed and eventually completed. After Eidos decided against publishing this version, Sega Europe secured the publishing rights and announced a European release date of November 1997. However, it was cancelled. An early prototype, with older character designs, was leaked in November 2008.\n\nThe original PlayStation release received mostly mixed reviews. Critics overwhelmingly commented that the game has a satisfyingly large amount of interactive scenery to destroy or collect weapons from, but agreed that despite the transition to 3D, the gameplay was not meaningfully different from the 2D beat 'em ups of earlier console generations. \"GameSpot\" summed it up as \"basically a 3D version of Capcom's classic, \"Final Fight\", except the characters and enemies lack the personality that made \"Final Fight\" exciting.\" Some, however, looked on the game's lack of innovation as a virtue rather than a liability; Shawn Smith commented in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", \"What's cool about \"Fighting Force\" is that it plays like the old side-scrolling games of the same nature. Then you might ask, why not just make a 2-D one. Well, when the 3-D works, why not go with it?\" \"Next Generation\" took more of a middle ground, stating that \"despite its derivative nature, \"Fighting Force\" is a very fun game. Yet, it's just not the same huge leap forward for the \"Final Fight\" genre that we might have expected from the creators of \"Tomb Raider\".\"\n\nBesides lack of originality, some critics criticized it for repetitiveness and took issue with how the control configuration assigns multiple actions to the same button while leaving other buttons on the controller unused, saying this often results in the character performing a different action than intended and leaving them open to enemy attacks. \"GamePro\" nonetheless opined, \"Despite its few flaws, \"Fighting Force\" delivers the fierce fun and beat-fools-silly action that PlayStation gamers are looking for.\" \"IGN\", while contradicting \"GamePro\" by actually praising the game's controls, offered a somewhat more pessimistic overall take: \"With solid graphics, impeccable control, yet almost zero innovation or variety, \"Fighting Force\" is a mixed bag. If in doubt, rent before you buy.\"\n\nA Nintendo 64 version of the game titled \"Fighting Force 64\" and published by Crave Entertainment was released in North America and Europe in 1999. Differences include partially improved graphics and changes in the available number of player lives.\n\nA sequel, \"Fighting Force 2\", was released in 1999 for the PlayStation and Dreamcast. Unlike the first title, \"Fighting Force 2\" focuses on the character of Hawk Manson exclusively, and rewards a more stealthy approach.\n\nA second sequel, \"Fighting Force 3\" was also in development for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, but was cancelled during development.\n"}

Formed in 2001, the band formerly consisted of lead vocalist Mick Pyro, bass guitarist and vocalist Benjamin Loose, keyboardist Darragh, guitarists and vocalists Dave Pyro and Darach O' Laoire and drummer and percussionist Coz Noelen. Additional percussion and vocals were provided by Orla La and Emily Rose.\n\nWith a self-described musical style of \"the stuff your dad likes\", the band signed to Big Cat Records in 2003, recording their debut album \"This is the Tomb of the Juice\" which was released in 2004. They were named \"Hope for 2004\" at the 2004 Meteor Awards. In 2005, the singles \"Comeback Girl\" and \"You Know It\" received significant airplay on Irish radio. Republic of Loose's second album \"Aaagh!\", released in April 2006, reached number two in the Irish Albums Chart, achieving platinum sales and a Choice Music Prize nomination in the process. It spawned several more successful singles, including \"Break\" which achieved notoriety in South Africa where a radio station banned it following complaints regarding its allegedly explicit lyrics. \"\", Republic of Loose's third album, was released in 2008. That album produced their highest chart performer to date, \"The Steady Song\", which peaked at number twelve and stayed in the Irish Singles Chart for thirteen weeks. \"Bounce at the Devil\", the band's fourth album, was released in 2010.\n\nHaving earned the admiration of several musicians, including members of Snow Patrol and U2, as well as Sinéad O'Connor—with whom they recorded, released and performed a duet at the 2008 Meteor Awards—the band have had their music played on radio stations in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. \"The Irish Times\" placed them at number thirty-seven in a list of \"The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now\" published in April 2009, referring to them as \"one of Ireland's most original bands\" led by \"the gruff singer with the extraordinary soul voice [...] simultaneously channelling the spirits of James Brown and James Joyce in one fell swoop.\" Aside from U2 and Bell X1, they are the Irish band with the most airplay in their native country. In August 2014, vocalist Mick Pyro confirmed that the band had split.\n\nMick Pyro performed with self-described \"rubbish rock bands\" for several years before the formation of The Republic of Loose. During this time, he was, according to himself, \"depressed out of my brains\" and listened to artists such as Manic Street Preachers. Experiencing what he termed \"a huge metaphysical overturning of my value system\", Pyro had developed a fascination with musicians such as James Brown and The Rolling Stones, or \"the stuff your Dad likes\". This change of musical interest prompted him to create Johnny Pyro, an alter-ego, who, according to Pyro, \"disassociated himself from the normal lifestyle of an Irish bourgeois kid\". This alter-ego would later develop into Johnny Pyro And The Rock Coma (Mik Pyro, Dave Pyro, Coz Noleon, Mark Dennehy and Emmet Cole). The band recorded an EP, which featured four of the songs that later appeared on the Republic of Loose's first album, 'This Is The Tomb Of The Juice.' Following the departure of guitarist Emmet Cole (who wrote the song \"Black Bread\") and bassist Mark Dennehey \"To Texas and Ringsend,\" respectively, Johnny Pyro and Rock Coma split.\n\nAbout a year later the Republic of Loose was formed. Benjamin Loose studied theology in Trinity College Dublin before performing in a country band with Mick Pyro. Dave Pyro used to play guitar with Brez and Deco joined them to play keys. The name Republic of Loose was settled upon in 2001 when Dave and Mick, combined with Brez, Deco, Coz Noleon, who had been Mick's schoolfriend, and Benjamin Loose.\n\nThe band's break, according to Mick Pyro, came as a result of ten days recording time they won in \"some competition or something, some fucking battle of the bands\". In 2003, Republic of Loose signed to Big Cat Records. The single \"Girl I'm Gonna Fuck You Up\", released in late 2003, was largely ignored by daytime radio in Ireland, with Mick Pyro commenting in an early \"Hot Press\" interview: \"We were never going to be the type of band that Larry Gogan or Ian Dempsey would play anyway, regardless of the lyric\". The band's debut album, \"This is the Tomb of the Juice\", was partially recorded in the ten days studio time they had won in the aforementioned competition. \"This is the Tomb of the Juice\" was recorded in 2003 then released in 2004. 2004 was also the year in which Republic of Loose débuted at Oxegen (on the New Band Stage), a festival at which they have since regularly performed. Singles \"Comeback Girl\" and \"You Know It\" were released in July and October 2005 respectively, both achieving significant airplay on Irish radio and entering the top thirty of the Irish Singles Chart. By 2006 the band had toured Ireland, the United Kingdom, where they performed at festivals such as Glastonbury and T in the Park, and France, where they performed at Furia Sound Festival, Nice Jazz Festival and Les Transmusicales. They also performed alongside veteran rock band Lir at Vicar Street in January 2006.\n\nAt a cost of €70,000 to make, the band's second album, \"Aaagh!\" was released in 2006. \"Sunday Tribune\" journalist Una Mullally called it \"one of the most original and progressive Irish albums ever made\". \"Aaagh!\" reached number two in the Irish Albums Chart, going platinum in the process, received regular airplay on Irish radio and produced five singles, including \"The Idiots\", a song about Mick Pyro's former girlfriend which also features her on vocals. \"Break\", a top ten single in Ireland and top forty single in South Africa, was temporarily banned by South African radio station 5fm when a female DJ declared on air that it promoted anal sex without contraception, a comment which led to several complaints from listeners. The band's 2006 summer tour included a performance where fans danced outside despite \"the lashing rain\" at Oxegen 2006, with the \"Irish Independent\"s Larissa Nolan saying \"their scheduling on the main stage was a testament to just how big their army of fans is\", and Castlepalooza. In 2007, Republic of Loose performed at several festivals in Ireland and the United Kingdom, including Reading and Leeds Festivals, Cois Fharraige and a headline slot at Indie-pendence. \"Aaagh!\" was released in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2007. In January 2008, Republic of Loose were one of the acts who recorded \"The Ballad of Ronnie Drew\" at Dublin's Windmill Lane Studios; the sessions led to a meeting with Sinéad O'Connor, with whom the band recorded and released a duet which was then performed live at the 2008 Meteor Awards the following month.\n\nOn 27 March 2008, Republic of Loose announced the track list and title for their third album. \"\" was released in May 2008, featuring contributions from Sinéad O'Connor, rapper Styles P and hip hoppers Millionaire Boyz. In the run-up to the release, the band uploaded free downloadable songs to their MySpace profile, including b-sides, live tracks and songs from \"Aaagh!\". \"Vol IV: Johnny Pyro and the Dance of Evil\" spent more than three months in the top thirty of the Irish Albums Chart,<ref name=\"The Insider: 09/09/2008\"></ref> spawning the successful singles, \"I Like Music\" and \"The Steady Song\", the latter their highest chart performer to date, having peaked at number twelve and stayed in the charts for thirteen weeks. Mick Pyro has described \"Vol IV: Johnny Pyro and the Dance of Evil\" as the first album the band feel proud of.\n\nIn support of the album's release, the band embarked on a small national tour and received an invitation to perform a sell-out month-long residency at The Dublin Academy for four consecutive Fridays, thus ending their habit of playing Dublin only once per year. This involved two-hour sets featuring new material and duets with Sinéad O'Connor—on her song \"Nothing Compares 2 U\"—and Damien Dempsey—on the Thin Lizzy song \"Dancing in the Moonlight\". The Academy residency led to a Meteor Award nomination for Best Irish Live Performance the following year and they would return for another performance at the same venue that September.<ref name=\"The Insider - 12/09/2008\"></ref> A couple were engaged as part of a BBC television series prior to the Sunday evening appearance of Republic of Loose on the O2 Stage at Oxegen 2008— a performance which also featured collaborator Styles P— whilst the band also performed for several journalists backstage.

In June 2009, the band were part of a collaboration of musicians calling themselves The Troublemakers who recorded a cover version of the Horslips song \"Trouble with a Capital T\" for charity.<ref name=\"The Insider: 09/06/2009\"></ref> The recording session was part of \"The Raw Sessions\" and the song was performed by The Troublemakers on \"The Late Late Show\".

Republic of Loose participated in the international celebration of the 250th birthday of Guinness—known as Arthur's Day— which took place on 24 September 2009.\n\nIn July 2010, Republic of Loose returned to Oxegen. Their fourth album, \"Bounce at the Devil\", was released later that year and led to an appearance on \"The Late Late Show\". The album, recorded in Baltimore, \"blends a myriad of influences -- from plastic soul to the sort of 'big hair' rock of the 80s\", according to \"Irish Independent\" reviewer John Meagher. \"Entertainment.ie\"s Jenny Mulligan describes it as good craic but occasionally bordering on obnoxious.\n\nRepublic of Loose's genre has been defined by various sources as blues, funk, metal, R'n'B, pop, rock and soul. They are influenced by acts such as Bobby Brown, James Brown, Al Green, Howlin' Wolf, Michael Jackson, Prince and The Rolling Stones. They perform as a six-piece band complete with backing singers. The chant, \"Loose! Loose Loose!\", is commonly heard from the crowd during their performances.\n\nRepublic of Loose have earned the admiration of several musicians. Damien Dempsey called them the \"best band in Ireland\" after performing alongside them. Sinéad O'Connor, in an e-mail to the \"Irish Independent\", asked to become a member of what she described as \"simply the best Irish band ever\". Bono has described them as \"sophisticated soul bootboys\", \"trailblazers\" and proclaimed that \"the Celtic Twilight turned into Celtic soul with Van Morrison, then Republic of Loose grabbed the Celtic Tiger by the tail, swung it around their heads and threw it out the window into the cosmos\". Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody, who called them \"the best band in the country this year [2007] and for many years to come\". Snow Patrol have also remixed \"Comeback Girl\". Praise has come from other musicians too, including Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters. Marcus Russell, manager of Oasis, is reported as having called Republic of Loose the \"most exciting new band\" since Oasis. Novelist Irvine Welsh has referred to \"Comeback Girl\" as \"one of the greatest songs ever recorded\". Actress Mischa Barton is also a fan.\n\nPaul Lester, writing in British newspaper \"The Guardian\" in July 2007, described Republic of Loose as an \"Irish OutKast\" to be filed next to Danny Wilson, Hall & Oates and N.E.R.D and least likely to be compared to The Pogues. John Meagher, writing in the \"Irish Independent\" in April 2008, said the band were \"out of step entirely with prevailing trends [...] almost like they stopped listening to music after hearing the young Prince and early Dexys Midnight Runners\". Vocalist Mick Pyro has commented that there are very few musicians performing \"authentic modern soul\" and that the band's aim is to \"combine the energy of the New York Dolls with the funk and soul qualities of The Roots\". When writing a piece on The Script in August 2008, Brian Boyd of \"The Irish Times\" claimed that they were \"as un-Irish sounding as The Republic of Loose \". Internationally, they have established fan bases in London and New York City and have achieved regular airplay on Los Angeles radio in the United States, as well as France, Indonesia and the Philippines.

{"id": "1970210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970210", "title": "Sal Cuevas", "text": "Sal Cuevas\n\nSalvador \"Sal\" Cuevas was an American electric bass guitarist and upright bassist who was for many years a member of the salsa music group Fania All-Stars, circa (1978–1985), as well as several other top name salsa groups of the time such as Johnny Pacheco, Héctor Lavoe, Willie Colon/Ruben Blades, etc. During this time, he was also one of five bass players in New York City who recorded many of the \"Jingles\" for T.V. and Radio (The others were Marcus Miller, Will Lee, Francisco Centeno, and Neil Jason). For his high school years he attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art.\n\nSal also enjoyed the title of Musical Director to Willie Colon's orquestra both during Willie's collaborations with famed Panamanian singer/songwriter/actor Rubén Blades, and Willie's solo singing ventures. Sal was born in Manhattan in 1955, and raised in The Bronx, New York City of Puerto Rican parents. He grew up in the tough streets of the South Bronx where at the age of five, his dad began helping him develop his deep love of music, and as a result Sal was able to stay away from the negative influences those streets can bring. Musically speaking, the demographics of the city during the time provided Sal with a tremendous array of musical influences which he absorbed and later incorporated into his bass playing technique and style.\n\nAlways in demand, he has recorded and performed with a long list of the giants of salsa, jazz, pop, rock and beyond, including; Willie Colón, Rubén Blades, Héctor Lavoe, Ray Barretto, Tito Puente, Machito, Fania All-Stars, Celia Cruz, Larry Harlow, Ismael Miranda, Eddie Palmieri, Cheo Feliciano, Johnny Pacheco, Tito Nieves, Soledad Bravo, Sophy, Fernandito Villalona, Tito Allen, Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz, Papo Lucca, Arturo Sandoval, Billy Idol, Lenny Kravitz, Cissy Houston, Kirsty MacColl, Jon Lucien, The Manhattans, Mongo Santamaria, Angela Bofill, Dave Valentin, Noel Pointer, Airto & Flora Purim, Harry Belafonte, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Gilberto Santarosa, Olga Tañón, Jaci Velaquez, Mandy Moore, José Feliciano, Oscar D'León, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, Franco De Vita, Rocio Durcal, Ricardo Montaner, Amaury Gutiérrez, Cristian Castro, David Bisbal, Thalía, La India, Isaac Delgado, Obie Bermúdez, Jimena, Los Ilegales, Los Gaitanes, Gian Marco, Hector 'El Father', Don Omar, \nTego Calderon, Rita Moreno, Alejandro Sanz, IL Volo, Black Eyed Peas, Usher, and the list, (much too long to list here), goes on and on with hundreds of other world-famous artist, both Latin and/or American. \n\nThe early to mid-1970s was a time when the electric bass guitar came of age with the likes of world-famous jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke established the instrument as a solo voice. Cuevas was an innovator of this style in Latin music, as on Ray Barreto album \"Ricanstruction\" where he takes solos alongside the horns. On a couple of tracks, he also uses sound modifying effects and foot pedals to add a different \"color\" to the sound of the bass. Sal is credited as being the innovator of Latin music bass playing when he first incorporated never before heard, nor utilized, Funk/Jazz/R&B/Rock styles and techniques on the instrument.\n\nWhile maintaining the traditional flavor and concepts of authenticity within Latin music, he managed to fuse all those other \"worlds\" into his bass playing technique resulting in the creation of an innovative style. On some recordings for instance, he would play very intricate horn section lines or phrases on the bass in unison with the horns, which until then was virtually unheard of within the genre, as was his funky bass slapping and string snapping technique which today has become a norm for bassist within Latin \"salsa\" music thanks to Sal. He also incorporated the technique of \"tapping\" in his Latin bass playing.\n\nOn the electric upright bass, Sal incorporated techniques which also (until then) were completely unheard of in Latin music such as slides, (Glissandos), and utilizing the very upper ranges of the instrument, (Check out Sal with Papo Lucca/Celia Cruz on Sonora Poncena's \"La Ceiba Y La Siguaraya\"). Internet searches on Sal are sometimes incomplete, but he is currently living in South Florida where he stays very active doing recordings, songwriting, and productions. Sal plays a couple of other instruments as well.\n\nCuevas died May 9, 2017 in Miami, Florida.\n"}

He attended GCVI (Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute), in Guelph, Ontario.\n\nA stalwart, stay at home defenceman, in 1967 Howell was the last player in the pre-expansion era to win the Norris Trophy, and famously said that he was glad he won the trophy then, because Bobby Orr (who finished second that year) would \"own\" the Norris for some time to come (as it turned out, Orr would win the trophy for the next eight seasons).\n\nHowell's playing weight was 195 and he stood 6 foot 1 inches tall. He played seventeen years wearing number 3 for the Rangers then he played another eight years in professional hockey; two with Oakland/California Seals, three with the Los Angeles Kings, and one each with three World Hockey Association (WHA) teams: New York Golden Blades/Jersey Knights (1973–74 WHA season), San Diego Mariners (1974–75), and ending his playing career with the Calgary Cowboys (1975–76).\n\nHowell first moved into team management while still a player. After just seven games with the New York Golden Blades, on November 21, 1973, Howell was elevated to player-coach when the team was moved and became the Jersey Knights for the remainder of the season. At the end of that season, the Knights moved and became the San Diego Mariners, with Howell still performing double duty as player-coach. Howell was strictly a player during his season with the Calgary Cowboys.\n\nHowell played 1411 NHL games and 170 WHA games, scoring 101 goals and 360 assists for 461 points.\n\nHe was named a First Team All-Star in 1967, and played in All-Star Games in 1954, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1970. When he left the NHL, Howell had played more games as a defenseman than anyone else, and remains sixth in all time games played as a defenseman. He also holds the record for most games played for New York Rangers: 1,160.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Howell became General Manager of the Cleveland Barons for the 1977–78 NHL season. The Barons were in dire financial circumstances, and merged with the equally challenged Minnesota North Stars at the end of that season. Howell became head coach of the merged Minnesota North Stars for the season.\n\nHowell was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nIn 1990, he finally won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Edmonton Oilers where he served as a scout.\n\nHowell's #3, along with Andy Bathgate's #9, was retired by the New York Rangers during a special ceremony prior to the February 22, 2009 match versus the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nIn the 2009 book \"100 Ranger Greats\", the authors ranked Howell at No. 10 all-time of the 901 New York Rangers who had played during the team's first 82 seasons.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970228", "title": "Ghulam Azam", "text": "Ghulam Azam\n\nGhulam Azam (; 7 November 192223 October 2014) was a Bangladeshi Islamist politician and the former leader of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, a largest Islamist political party in Bangladesh.\n\nAzam was arrested by the Government of Bangladesh on 11 January 2012 after he was found guilty in war crimes charges during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. He founded the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh for East Pakistan during 1971 unrest that was aimed at to oppose the independence of Bangladesh. He led the party until 2000.\n\nOn 15 July 2013, a Bangladeshi special tribunal, the International Crimes Tribunal found him guilty of war crimes such as conspiring, planning, incitement to and complicity in committing genocide and was sentenced to 90 years in jail. The tribunal stated that Azam deserved capital punishment for his activity during Liberation war of Bangladesh, but was given a lenient punishment of imprisonment because of his age and poor health condition. The trial was criticized by several international observers, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Human Rights Watch, which was initially supportive of a trial subsequently criticized \"strong judicial bias towards the prosecution and grave violations of due process rights\", calling the trial process deeply flawed and unable to meet international fair trial standards. Notably, it was at the center of the 2012 ICT Skype controversy.\n\nAs a leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, he led the formation of the Shanti Committees that were formed at the time of the Liberation War alongside other pro-Pakistan Bengali leaders. Azam was accused of forming paramilitary groups for the Pakistani Army, including Razakars, and Al-Badr. These militias opposed the Mukti Bahini members who fought for the independence of Bangladesh, and also stand accused of war crimes.\nAzam's citizenship was cancelled by the Bangladeshi Government because of playing an opposition role during the Bangladesh liberation war.\n\nHe lived informally in Bangladesh from 1978 to 1994 without any authorised Bangladeshi visa. His citizenship was then reinstated by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.\n\nAzam was arrested on 11 January 2012 by the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh on the charges of committing war crimes during the Bangladesh liberation war. The tribunal rejected the plea of bail after noting that there were formal charges against Azam of which it had taken cognisance.\n\nHe was 91 when he died of a stroke on 23 October 2014 at BSMMU.\n\nSeveral hundred thousand people attended his funeral prayers that were televised and held at the national masjid (mosque) Baitul Mukarram.\n\nAzam was born on 7 November 1922 in Bengal, former province of British India. He was the eldest son of Maulana Ghulam Kabir and Sayeda Ashrafunnisa. He attended a Madrasa in his village Birgaon, Nabinagar in Comilla and completed his secondary school education in Dhaka. He then joined Dhaka University where he completed BA and MA degrees in Political science.\n\nWhile studying at the University of Dhaka, Azam became active in student's politics and was elected as the General Secretary of the Dhaka University Central Students' Union (DUCSU) for the two consecutive years between 1947 and 1949. As a General Secretary of the DUCSU, Azam in 1947 submitted a memorandum on the union's behalf to the Prime Minister of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan, demanding that Bengali be made a state language along with Urdu. At that time, Bangladesh was administered by the Pakistan. \"Bangla was a wrong decision with regard to the establishment of Pakistan since Urdu was widely used and all Muslims of the Indian subcontinent were Urdu speakers.\"\n\nIn 1950, Azam left Dhaka to teach political science at the Government Carmichael College in Rangpur. During this time, he was influenced by the writings of Abul Ala Maududi and he joined Maududi's party Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan in 1954, and was later elected as the Secretary General of Jamaat-e-Islami's East Pakistan branch.\n\nIn 1964, the government of Ayub Khan banned Jamaat-e-Islami and its leaders, including Azam, and imprisoned them for eight months without trials. He played a prominent role as the general secretary of the Pakistan Democratic Movement formed in 1967 and later, he was elected as the member of Democratic Action Committee in 1969 to transform the anti-Ayub movement into a\npopular uprising. In 1969, he became the Ameer of the Jamaat in East Pakistan. He and other opposition leaders including future President of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took part in the Round Table Conference held in Rawalpindi in 1969 to solve the prevailing political impasse in Pakistan. On 13 March 1969, Khan announced his acceptance of their two fundamental demands of parliamentary government and direct elections.\n\nIn the runup to the 1970 Pakistani general election, Azam together with leaders of a number of other parties in East Pakistan (including the Pakistan Democratic Party, National Awami Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and the Pakistan National League) protested at the Awami League approach to electioneering for, accusing them of breaking up public meetings, physical attacks on political opponents and the looting and destruction of party offices. During 1970, while Azam was the head of Jamaat-e-Islami East Pakistan, a number of political rallies, including rallies of Jamaat-e-Islami, were attacked by armed mobs alleged to be incited by the Awami League.\n\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War, Azam took a political stance in support of unified Pakistan, and repeatedly denounced Awami League and Mukti Bahini secessionists, whose declared aim after 26 March 1971 became the establishment of an independent state of Bangladesh in place of East Pakistan. Excerpts from Azam's speeches after 25 March 1971 used to be published in the spokespaper of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami named \"The Daily Sangram\". On 20 June 1971, Azam reaffirmed his support for the Pakistani army by citing that 'the army has eradicated nearly all criminals of East Pakistan'.\n\nDuring the war of 1971, it was alleged that Azam played a central role in the formation of East Pakistan Central Peace Committee on 11 April 1971, which declared the independence movement a conspiracy planned by India. It was also alleged that Azam was one of the founding members of this organization. The Peace Committee members were drawn from Azam's Jamaat-e-Islami, the Muslim League and Biharis. The Peace Committee served as a front for the army, informing on the civil administration as well as the general public. They were also in charge of confiscating and redistribution of shops and lands from Hindu and pro-independence Bengali activists, mainly relatives and friends of Mukti Bahini fighters. The Shanti Committee has also been alleged to have recruited Razakars. The first recruits included 96 Jamaat party members, who started training in an Ansar camp at Shahjahan Ali Road, Khulna. During Azam's leadership of Jamaat-e-Islami, Ashraf Hossain, a leader of Jamaat's student wing Islami Chhatra Sangha, created the Al-Badr militia in Jamalpur district on 22 April 1971. On 12 April 1971, Azam and Matiur Rahman Nizami led demonstrations denouncing the independence movement as an Indian conspiracy.\n\nDuring the war, Azam travelled to West Pakistan at the time to consult the Pakistani leaders. He declared that his party (Jamaat) is trying its best to curb the activities of pro-independence \"Miscreants\". He took part in meetings with General Yahya Khan, the military dictator of Pakistan, and other military leaders, to organize the campaign against Bangladeshi independence.\n\nOn 12 August 1971, Azam declared in a statement published in the \"Daily Sangram\" that \"the supporters of the so-called Bangladesh Movement are the enemies of Islam, Pakistan, and Muslims\". He also called for an all out war against India. He called for the annexation of Assam.\n\nAzam was also alleged as the prime standard-bearer who presented the blueprint of the killing of the intellectuals during a meeting with Rao Farman Ali in early September 1971. According to this blue print, Pakistani Army and the local collaborators executed the killing of the Bengali intellectuals on 14 December 1971.\n\nOn 20 June 1971, Azam declared in Lahore that the Hindu minority in East Pakistan, under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, are conspiring to secede from Pakistan. On 12 August 1971, Azam declared in a statement published in the \"Daily Sangram\" that \"the supporters of the Bangladesh Movement are the enemies of Islam, Pakistan, and Muslims\". On his side, Azam denied all such accusations and challenged by giving reasons to justify them. However, he later admitted that he was on the list of collaborators of the Pakistani army, but denied he was a war criminal.\n\nThe military junta of Yahya Khan decided to call an election in an effort to legitimize themselves. On 12 October 1971, Yahya Khan declared that an election will be held from 25 November to 9 December. Azam decided to take part in this election. On 15 October, the Pakistani government suddenly declared that 15 candidates were elected without any competition. According to the declaration of 2 November, as many as 53 candidates were elected without any competition. In this election Jamaat won 14 of the uncontested seats.\n\nFormer advisor to the Caretaker government of Bangladesh, human rights activist and witness for the prosecution Sultana Kamal said- \"In brutality, Ghulam Azam is synonymous with German ruler Hitler who had influential role in implementation and execution of genocide and ethnic cleansing\". In response to this statement, the defense counsel pointed out that the comparison was a fallacy and \"fake with malicious intention\" as Hitler held state power, which Azam did not and that in 1971 General Tikka Khan and Yahya Khan held state power. Prosecutor of ICT Zead-Al-Malum said- “He was the one making all the decisions, why would he need to be on any committee? Being Hitler was enough for Hitler in World War II.”\n\nGovernment of newly independent Bangladesh, banned Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and cancelled Azam's citizenship for playing alleged role during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Azam lived in exile in London until he was allowed to return home in 1978.\n\nJamaat's rehabilitation began when Ziaur Rahman became president after a coup in 1975 and lifted the previous ban on religious parties. In 1977, Zia removed secularism in the constitution, replacing it with Islamic ideals, further clearing the way for Jamaat-e-Islami to return to political participation. In 1978, Azam returned to Bangladesh on a Pakistani passport with a temporary visa, and stayed as a Pakistani national even after his visa expired, he refused to leave the country and continued to live in Bangladesh. His stay was however unwelcome in Bangladesh, and he was beaten by an angry mob at the footsteps of the Baitul Mukarram mosque while attending a funeral in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, Azam was particularly critical of the military rule of General Ershad after he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and Jamaat-e-Islami took part in demonstrations and strikes as well as other opposition parties such as the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). He proposed a caretaker government system to facilitate free and fair elections, which was adopted in 1990. In the 1991 Bangladeshi general election, Jamaat-e-Islami won 18 seats and its support allowed the BNP to form a government.\n\nDuring this time, he acted unofficially as the Ameer (leader) of Jamaat-e-Islami until 1991, when he was officially elected to the post. This led the government arresting him and an unofficial court called \"The People's Court\" was established by the civilians such as Jahanara Imam to try alleged war criminals and anti-independence activists. Imam held a symbolic trial of Azam where thousands of people gathered and gave the verdict that Azam's offences committed during the Liberation War deserve capital punishment. In 1994, he fought a lengthy legal battle which resulted in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh ruling in his favor and restoring his nationality.\n\nIn the 1996 election, Jamaat won only three seats, and most of their candidates lost their deposits. Azam announced his retirement from active politics in late 2000. He was succeeded by Motiur Rahman Nizami.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, Azam was arrested on charges of committing crimes against humanity and peace, genocide and war crimes in 1971 by the International Crimes Tribunal. His petition for bail was rejected by the ICT, and he was sent to Dhaka Central Jail. However, three hours later he was taken to the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) hospital for a medical check-up because of his aging.\nAccording to \"The Daily Star\", Azam was allowed to remain in a hospital prison cell despite being declared fit for trial by a medical team on 15 January. The same paper later acknowledged that he had been placed there because to his \"ailing condition\".\n\nAzam's health was deteriorating rapidly since being imprisoned. His wife, Syeda Afifa Azam reported in several newspapers as being shocked about Azam's treatment and stated that he was very weak and had lost 3 kilograms in a month due to malnutrition. She described his treatment as \"a gross violation of human rights\" even though he was kept in a hospital prison cell.\n\nAzam's wife complained that he had been denied proper family visits and access to books, saying that this amounted to \"mental torture\". \"The Daily Star\" reported that Azam's wife and his counsels were allowed to meet him on 18 February.\nOn 25 February 2012, \"The Daily Star\" further reported that Azam's nephew was denied a visit shortly before he was about to enter hospital prison. This was despite the application for the visit being first approved.\n\nIslamic activists from different countries expressed their concerns for Mr. Azam. The International Union of Muslim Scholars, chaired by Yusuf al-Qaradawi called the arrest \"disgraceful\", and called on the Bangladesh government to release him immediately, stating that \"the charge of Professor Ghulam Azam and his fellow scholars and Islamic activists of committing war crimes more than forty years ago is irrational and cannot be accepted\".\n\nThe judicial process under which Azam was on trial was criticized by international organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.\nSo far, the ICT has sentenced two of the accused to death and another one to life imprisonment.\n\nAzam was convicted of war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War by the International Crimes Tribunal-1 of Bangladesh. The charges against Azam were torturing and the killings of a police officer \"Shiru Mia\" and three other civilians. He was found guilty on all five charges and was sentenced to 90 years in prison. The judges unanimously agreed that Azam deserved capital punishment but was given a lenient punishment because of his aging and poor health condition.\n\nIn a press release, Jamaat's Acting Secretary General \"Rafiqul Islam\" rejected the International Crimes Tribunal's verdict against Azam by stating his conviction \"nothing but a reflection of what AL-led 14-party alliance leaders had said against him Ghulam Azam in different meetings\". Pro-BNP newspaper \"Daily Amardesh\", whose publication is currently ceased over publishing false news to instigate violence, reported that the evidence presented before the court against Ghulam Azam consisted of newspaper clippings published during 1971.\"\n\nGhulam Azam died after he suffered a stroke on 23 October 2014 at 10:10 PM at BSMMU while serving jail sentences for crimes against humanity during Bangladesh Liberation War. His death was reported by Abdul Majid Bhuiyan, director of BSMMU. Ghulam was put on life support system at 8 PM. He was also suffering from kidney ailments.\nAzam was buried at his family graveyard at Moghbazar, Dhaka on 25 October.\nHis namaz-e-janaza (Islamic funeral prayer) was held at Bangladesh's national mosque Baitul Mokarram. The funeral was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourners. Different quarters of the country protested against taking Azam's body to the national mosque because of his war crimes conviction and his opposition role to the independence of the country.\n"}

The company was founded in 1982. It is owned by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which acquired the company in 2002 and has been operating it since that time as a division of its Reynolds American.\n\nSanta Fe Natural Tobacco Company was founded by Bill Drake, who had published \"The Cultivator's Handbook of Marijuana\", Robert Marion, an acupuncture student at the Kototama Institute in Santa Fe, and Chris Webster, a Santa Fe Realtor. Drake had written his second book, \"The Cultivator's Handbook of Natural Tobacco\", and began cultivating a strain of \"Nicotiana rustica\" a friend had found on the San Juan Pueblo. The men began mixing surplus bulk leaf tobacco from North Carolina and wild-grown \"rustica\" in the basement of Marion’s rented house. Startup investments came from Edward Wikes, a plumbing contractor, Robert Wolf, an oil rig roughneck, and Philip Naumburg, an heir to the Elkan Naumburg fortune. Drake purchased a Thomas Nast caricature of a Native American chief smoking a volcano for $250 and began using it as the company logo.\n\nAfter discovering Drake and Marion had been wasting funds on their “alternative lifestyle”, the board of directors and company investors took control of the company. Wolf became the company’s president and began marketing the product to retail outlets on Indian Reservations. The company moved into the basement of the adobe Gross Kelly warehouse building in Santa Fe’s downtown rail yard.\n\nIn 1986, the company's board of directors hired Robin Sommers, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who had been a subscription data specialist for \"Newsweek\" and \"Esquire\" in Greenwich Village before briefly running the Ice Palace nightclub on Fire Island. Sommers, who had paid for one of Drake’s experimental tobacco crops in 1981, implemented a direct-to-consumer advertising strategy, beginning by targeting New Age readers with coupon advertisements in the \"East West Journal\", \"Rolling Stone\", and the \"Utne Reader\". Sommers commissioned a New York City graphic artist to design a new art deco logo. In 1987, the company made $88,000 in sales.\n\nAfter 1994 congressional hearings, Big Tobacco publicly released a 599-item list of additives in cigarettes. Whole Foods Market and natural food stores began carrying American Spirit. Sommers, who had become Chief Executive Officer, insisted in contracts with wholesalers on premium pricing for his cigarettes, explaining “I didn’t want them going to 7-Elevens.” Sommers moved the company from the rail yard warehouse to Santa Fe’s White Swan building located on Cerrillos Road. Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company agreed to add “Natural” to its product name after being sued by American Tobacco for trademark infringement. Natural American Spirit became popular with celebrities, with Sean Penn, Joni Mitchell, and Gwyneth Paltrow praising the cigarette in magazine interviews and Mac Miller having the company logo tattooed on his chest.\n\nIn 1998, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company signed the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, where it was made to pay out less than Big Tobacco because the company was younger. In 1999, the company opened a new $4.5 million plant outside Oxford, North Carolina, using only organic certified farmers.\n\nIn 2002, R.J. Reynolds bought Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company for $340 million. Sommers, who by then owned 42% of the company, signed a noncompete agreement and left the company. Profits rose 50% annually for the next decade. Sales of Natural American Spirit increased 86% from 2009 to 2014.\n\nIn 2015, the Food and Drug Administration sent the company a letter warning that “natural” and “additive-free” were false marketing of a “modified risk product”.\n\nIn September 2015, Japan Tobacco International paid $5 billion for the right to manufacture and sell Natural American Spirit in Asia and Europe. Japan Tobacco has so far continued to source its leaf from Santa Fe Natural’s Oxford manufacturing plant, even sending its research scientists on a North Carolina State University agricultural extension tour.\n\nIn September 2016, plaintiffs from twelve states sued Santa Fe Natural and Reynolds in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, seeking class action certification for consumer fraud from false labeling claims. In November 2016, a second lawsuit was filed for false advertising practices. Reynolds is represented in the litigation by Jones Day.\n\nIn September 2015, a complaint was filed against Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the company's \"organic and additive-free marketing claims for the Natural American Spirit brand\" constituted fraud, false advertising, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition. Two similar complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico on December 22, 2015. A third federal class-action lawsuit was filed against the company in January 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suits may be consolidated.\n"}
{"id": "1970232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970232", "title": "The Magnificent Moodies", "text": "The Magnificent Moodies\n\nThe Magnificent Moodies is the 1965 debut album by The Moody Blues, first released in the UK, and the first and only album featuring their R&B line-up of guitarist Denny Laine, bassist Clint Warwick, keyboardist Mike Pinder, flautist–percussionist Ray Thomas, and drummer Graeme Edge. Lead vocals were shared by Laine, Pinder and Thomas. The album is a collection of R&B and Merseybeat songs, including the cover of \"Go Now\", produced by Alex Wharton, that had been a Number 1 hit single earlier that year. For the U.S. release, on London Records, with the title of \"Go Now – The Moody Blues #1\", four songs were replaced and the tracks re-ordered. The United States and Canadian versions also incorrectly titles three songs.\n\nThe album did not make the \"Record Retailer\"/\"Music Week\" chart even though it reached number 5 in August 1965 in the \"New Musical Express\" album chart. The U.S. album did not make the \"Billboard\" chart.\n\nThe sleeve notes on the original UK release include an (undated) review by Virginia Ironside, music critic of \"Daily Mail\", which concludes, \"With the Moody Blues, all you need to write is \"MAGNIFICENT\" in pink lipstick and leave it at that\"; and a prose poem by Donovan recommending the band. All the tracks on the UK release were produced by Denny Cordell; except for \"Go Now\", which was produced by Alex Wharton.\n\nLaine and Warwick left the group in 1966, and were replaced by guitarist Justin Hayward and bassist John Lodge respectively.\n\nAt the height of The Moody Blues' U.S. success in 1970, Deram Records reissued the U.S. version of the album with a new cover and title, \"In the Beginning\" (DES-18051). As with the original album, the reissue did not chart.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a double compilation album entitled \"A Dream\", which included the entire \"The Magnificent Moodies\" LP along with the A and B sides of Moody Blues singles released between 1965 and 1967 (prior to the release of the \"Days of Future Passed\" album) was issued in much of western Europe, but only available on import in the UK.\n\nIn 1985 Intermediate Records reissued the album on vinyl and cassette as \"Go Now\", with a mixture of songs from the original UK and US albums plus songs that would eventually be included as bonus tracks on the CD issues.

In military usage, a riposte is the strategic device of hitting a vulnerable point of the enemy, thereby forcing him to abandon his own attack.\n\nIn everyday language, a riposte is synonymous with a retort and describes a quick and witty reply to an argument or an insult.\n\nIn sabre and foil, the priority switches when the parry is successfully executed; the defending fencer now has \"right of way\" and may immediately attack with a riposte. The riposte may be direct, or may include compound footwork. If the riposte is delayed, the original attacker's remise gains priority. Riposte is analogous to \"kaeshi\" techniques in kendo.\n\nWhen one sets up a \"second intention\" attack, the reactions of one's opponent must be predicted. A fencer may execute an attack expecting to be parried, preparing to \"counter-parry\" and counter-riposte.\n\nAndré Beaufre defines riposte in military usage as the act of striking a vulnerable point of an enemy, forcing him to abandon his own attack. The chosen target must be vital to the enemy or at least highly important, so that it becomes imperative to the enemy to defend it. The overall objective is to regain the initiative in battle.\n"}
{"id": "1970247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970247", "title": "Francis X. DiLorenzo", "text": "Francis X. DiLorenzo\n\nFrancis Xavier DiLorenzo (April 15, 1942 – August 17, 2017) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the bishop of Richmond, Virginia, from 2004 until his death in 2017.\n\nPreviously DiLorenzo was the fourth bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, DiLorenzo was ordained to the priesthood in his hometown on May 18, 1968, at the age of 26.\n\nOn January 26, 1988, he was appointed an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Scranton. He was consecrated titular bishop of Tigias on March 8 of that year.\n\nIn 1994, Joseph Anthony Ferrario, the Bishop of Honolulu, fell ill and requested that the Vatican accept his resignation for health reasons. Bishop DiLorenzo was named the Apostolic Administrator of Honolulu on October 12, 1993, and he was appointed bishop on November 29, 1994. His installation included hula dancing. In attendance were Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, Apostolic Delegate, Cardinal Pio Taofinu'u of Samoa, and Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco. In 1997 DiLorenzo defended the use of hula in a variety of religious services in the diocese despite the Vatican's prohibition on liturgical dance, calling hula a native \"sacred gesture\".\n\nBishop DiLorenzo is often credited with creating the first zero tolerance policy on allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of priests—a policy that came about well before the Catholic sex abuse scandals that plagued the rest of the nation in the early 2000s.\n\nThe most outspoken critic of DiLorenzo was the rector of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, Father Nathan Mamo. In a letter dated July 7, 1999, Father Mamo wrote, \"I was quite upset over a whole host of problems in church governance, management and internal politics, problems which are real and grave.\" Bishop DiLorenzo transferred Mamo from the Cathedral parish to a suburban church, Saint John the Apostle and Evangelist, in Mililani Town. Bishop DiLorenzo and Father Mamo continued to argue vehemently even after the transfer and Father Mamo decided to leave Hawai`i. He wrote: \"I have become over the most recent 5 years... completely unable to keep that solemn promise with the current bishop. It's not simply a matter of differing opinions; it's a matter of integrity. I am unable to respect and obey him because my conscience doesn't allow me to cooperate in his methods.\" While remaining incardinated in the Honolulu see, Father Mamo was accepted for service in the diocese of San Jose, California, where he ministered as a parochial vicar at Saint Joseph of Cupertino Parish with the hope of eventually returning to Hawai`i under a new bishop.\n\nIn 2002, Bishop DiLorenzo retired Father George DeCosta, who had published a letter critical of Bishop DiLorenzo's \"Island Treasures\" program, which honored outstanding lay parish volunteers. Fr. DeCosta was the pastor of Malia Puka O Kalani Catholic Church in Keaukaha for thirty years. DeCosta later said he had taken advantage of the possibility of retiring at age 65, which required the bishop's permission, which DiLorenzo gave.\n\nOn March 31, 2004, the Vatican announced the transfer of Bishop DiLorenzo to the see of Richmond. Bishop DiLorenzo was officially installed there on May 24, 2004.\n\nJust after his installation, Bishop DiLorenzo dismissed a member of the diocese's women's commission, Judy Johnson, of Virginia Beach.\n\nAs of June 2005, Sister Edna Maier, S.N.D., and Sister Bernice McCourt, S.N.D., both members of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, and Mrs. Elizabeth Glenn, resigned their positions as pastoral coordinators with the diocese. Sister Edna had served as pastoral coordinator for a total of 21 years at Saint Paschal Baylon in South Boston and at Saint Elizabeth of Hungary in Brookneal. Sister Bernice had served the diocese since 1977 at St. Mary's Church in Chesapeake, Virginia, and plans to seek a ministry in Baltimore. Mrs. Glenn had served as pastoral coordinator at Resurrection in Portsmouth and Holy Spirit in Virginia Beach. Pastoral coordinators are paid positions with the diocese that can be filled by a deacon or a layman. Appointment to these positions is made by the bishop.\n\nUpon his installation, Bishop DiLorenzo reactivated the diocese's liturgical commission and named Father Russell Smith, S.T.D., parochial vicar at Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in New Kent County as diocesan theologian, a post that had been vacant since 1998. As theologian, Father Smith would examine for conformance to Catholic teaching all draft documents and issue approvals authorizing the publication of all printed materials generated by the diocese. Father Smith also would: (1) approve in advance any person who wishes to speak anywhere on Catholic church property in the diocese; (2) investigate complaints from parishioners who complain about liturgical abuses in a particular church and respond; and (3) recommend sanctions against persons responsible for such abuse to Bishop DiLorenzo. DiLorenzo noted that these kinds of checks and controls were needed because some people in the diocese were used to living outside the traditional boundaries of Catholicism.\n\nBishop DiLorenzo forcibly retired Father Thomas J. Quinlan, pastor of Holy Family Catholic Church in Virginia Beach for a history of using offensive language during mass which culminated in a grossly sacrilegious reference to the Virgin Mary at a Christmas Eve Mass. Although a significant number of parishioners appealed against the decision, many applauded the decision, wondering why it had not been done sooner.\n\nBishop DiLorenzo moved his residence from Cathedral Place to Midlothian. Some Catholics raised questions about the move and see it as a way to distance himself from his flock. But DiLorenzo responded that he is only 25 minutes away from the diocesan offices and that the move saved the Diocese money: \"Do I need to live in a three-story building by myself? I don't think so.\" The three-story house was turned into offices for those working in a building that the diocese was renting for $35,000 a year. \"We saved ourselves thirty-some thousand a year,\" said Bishop DiLorenzo, \"and I moved to Midlothian, a very quiet place.\"\n\nBishop DiLorenzo ended the diocesan sexual minorities commission, which his predecessor had established in 1977. He explained his decision: \"What was being done was not a ministry. It was trying to make a statement... for people who see themselves discriminated against. The statement that needed to be made has been made. We are not going to make a big deal about what your fantasy sexual life is\". He added that there are moral expectations for everyone: \"I think most people would agree that the ministry is to call all persons to Jesus Christ in discipleship. The gender issue was not raised by Jesus... Jesus called everyone to holiness. Are there certain groups in our population that need help in that journey?\"\n\nBishop DiLorenzo increased the number of clustered parishes. He also brought in consultants to review some diocesan departments and commissions that need to be abolished.\n\nThe spiritual director of the Richmond diocese's San Lorenzo Spiritual Center on Indian River Road, the Reverend Pantaleon Manalo, filed a lawsuit in Circuit Court, seeking $1.35 million alleging defamation by a group of people who accused him of financial improprieties, unexplained wealth, missing annual financial reports, abuse of power and making inappropriate sexual statements. The group consists of members or former members, of the San Lorenzo Spiritual Center, who in April 2004, sent a petition to a newly arrived Bishop DiLorenzo, alleging various acts committed by Father Manalo.\n\nThe petition helped convince the vicar forane, Msgr. Thomas J. Caroluzza, to ask for Father Manalo's resignation in December. On December 10, 2005, Bishop DiLorenzo terminated Fr. Manalo's position, but then temporarily stayed that decision. After further investigation, DiLorenzo announced that Father Manalo had done no wrong, since the diocese investigated San Lorenzo Spiritual Center and not Fr. Manalo, but he would have to step down from his leadership post at the center. Although Father Manalo continued on as a spiritual director of the center and chaplain at two nearby hospitals. Bishop DiLorenzo appointed Father Salvador Anonuevo, pastor of Saint Luke parish in Virginia Beach, as administrator of the center. The San Lorenzo Spiritual Center is the site of spiritual and cultural celebrations for some 23,000 Filipinos living in Hampton Roads.\n\nOn August 1, 2005, Judge Padrick, Circuit Court of Virginia, dismissed the defamation lawsuit in that it is an \"intrusion into church affairs and violated the religious protections of the U.S. Constitution and the Virginia Constitution\" per Brandon H. Zeigler, the defendants' attorney. Manalo's attorney, Robert L. Samuel Jr. said, he expects to appeal Padrick's ruling to the Virginia Supreme Court.\n\nBishop DiLorenzo appointed the Rev. Jesse Enciso, Pastor of Holy Spirit Catholic Church, as the administrator of San Lorenzo Spiritual Center. The former administrator, Fr. Anonuevo, has returned to the U.S. after a three-month absence since May 2005. Fr. Jesse Enciso resigned his position as administrator effective October 15, 2005. This belies the difficulty and complexity that the center poses to any leadership. A new lay administrator is to be appointed by the Bishop. The Bishop has appointed Mrs. Marilyn Aguirre as interim administrator to San Lorenzo. Mrs. Aguirre and San Lorenzo Administration has reinstated Fr. Manalo as spiritual advisor to the center.\n\nBishop DiLorenzo died from heart and kidney failure on August 17, 2017 at St. Mary's Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 75.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1970267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970267", "title": "Fabio Lione", "text": "Fabio Lione\n\nFabio Tordiglione (born 9 October 1973), known professionally as Fabio Lione, is an Italian singer and lyricist who has worked with many bands in the metal genre. He was known for being the singer of Italian power metal band Rhapsody of Fire for 21 years. He later formed his own band Turilli / Lione Rhapsody with former Rhapsody of Fire guitarist Luca Turilli. He is also the current lead vocalist of Angra, and was the original singer of Labyrinth and Vision Divine.\n\nLione was born in Pisa. His career started in 1990 at the age of 17 when he began to sing with a small rock and roll underground group who played classics of 1950s and 1960s similar to Elvis Presley's songs. He had a passion for groups such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning, and Crimson Glory, which inspired him to form his own heavy metal band.\n\nHis musical activities continued with a young group from Pisa, named Athena. They were a progressive metal band with their own unique style and challenged various expressions. Lione recorded a demotape with Athena and it was his first experience in a metal band. Lione did twenty shows with the band, but after two years, he left the band in 1994. Athena made their first album in 1995 (\"Inside the moon\").\n\nAt first his stage name was Joe Terry which was the combination of his favourite heroes' names in Japanese games (Joe Higashi and Terry Bogard from Fatal Fury). His first piece of musical equipment was a Shure SM 58 microphone.\n\nLione met the band Labyrinth, then going under the name of \"Vision\". Shortly after, in 1993 the band started to work on a demotape called \"Midnight Resistance\" , lyrics and vocal lines written by Lione. Before the album \"No Limits\" was released, Lione recorded a mini CD with Labyrinth , [Piece of Time] lyrics and vocal lines written by Fabio Lione.\n\nLione created the album \"No Limits\" together with Olaf, a band member of Labyrinth. His lyrics were mainly based on his personal experiences and his emotions. He wrote vocal lines and lyrics for this record, all the lyrics in the album were connected as Lione did this as an experiment. Labyrinth's style was different from other bands because it was mixed with different music genres including thrash metal and progressive rock. Lione was the singer of Labyrinth for just more than three years.\n\nHe joined Athena in 1991 and in 1992 they recorded their first demotape. After several concerts he left the band in 1993 for a new collaboration, the one with Labyrinth. Athena called Lione again in '97 ..so they could start work on their second album \"A New Religion\" which was released in 1998. Lione wrote the lyrics and the vocal lines for ten songs; the lyrics used religious and philosophical words and had the tendency to reflect deep meanings on their music. Lione and the other members of Athena attended Axel Rudi Pell Tour 1998 with Dreamscape, another progressive metal band from Germany in December. Shortly after the tour the band decided to break up.\n\nIn 1999 he met Olaf Thorsen and to seal their newfound friendship, they decided to create what was originally supposed to be only a side-project: Vision Divine. Lione now found himself in the two groups: Rhapsody and Vision Divine, and this situation continued, with successes in both groups, until 2003. The first \"Vision Divine\" record in 1999 received excellent sales results and criticism (and took the band on tour in South America for the first time). The second album of Vision Divine \"Send me an angel\" was released in January 2002. Lione composed eight vocal lines for this album. Their expressions became more serious and deeper, close to the reality of divinity and humanity with progressive and heavy sounds. The album \"Beto Vazquez Infinity\" was released in February, including the song \"The battle of the Past\" in which Lione was singing as a guest vocalist for the Beto Vazquez project.\n\nIn 2003 Lione sang at shows with Vision Divine at Gods of Metal 2003 (Milan) and at Heineken Jammin' Festival (Imola) in June. He then recorded four demo songs with Vision Divine in November and performed on an Italian Tour in December. Shortly after it was announced Lione had to leave the band, due to his other commitments making it too difficult front this band as well. He nevertheless spent most of the year writing and left the band nine new vocal lines for the \"Stream of Consciousness\" album, executed with a different singer.\n\nIn 2008 Lione took part in some shows with Vision Divine to celebrate the ten years of the band, and on 28 May, they announced that Fabio had rejoined the band as the new singer. The band released the new CD \"9 Degrees West of the Moon\" in 2009 and did many shows supporting the record.\n\nIn 2012 they released (with Edel/Ear music) what is probably considered their best work so far, \"Destination Set To Nowhere\", with many great reviews received. The band performed many shows in Italy, Spain and on a South-American tour supporting the record.\n\nFabio departed from \"Vision Divine\" on 28 April 2018.\n\nIn 1997, the most important and longest running moment began: becoming the lead vocalist of the heavy metal/power metal band Rhapsody. Rhapsody first began negotiations with Lione at Gate Pathway Studio in Wolfsburg, Germany after hearing him in the \"Piece of Time\" album from Labyrinth. Later that year, the first of many albums, Legendary Tales, was released with Lione as lead vocalist. The second album, Symphony of Enchanted Lands, would be released in 1998, followed by Dawn of Victory in 2000.\n\nThe band participated in many concerts throughout their first years. Lione also recorded a new EP album Rain of a Thousand Flames with Rhapsody in Germany between April and August. The album was released in December 2001. Lione performed on stages with Rhapsody at Gods of Metal 2001 (Milan) in June, during South American Tour (Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and Chile) and at Rock Machina Festival (Spain) in July. After these concerts, Lione and Rhapsody recorded their fifth album Power of the Dragonflame. The album was released in March 2002.\n\nRhapsody travelled with Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica on a successful European tour in April and May 2000 when they also had a chance to join the Wacken Festival 2000 in Germany. Lione attended Rock Machina Festival in Spain in July. Lione set out on Rhapsody's first headlining tour (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Japan and Korea) and joined the summer festivals in Europe including the Bang Your Head Festival in Germany.\n\nIn February 2004, he finished vocals for Rhapsody's new album . The band went promo tour for their new album throughout Canada, US, Germany, Sweden, Czech Republic, Greece, and the UK. On the album's release day, 27 September, the band had a signing session with Christopher Lee in London. Lione also appeared with Christopher Lee on a TV music program in Germany. In 2005, because of copyright issues, the band officially changed its name to Rhapsody of Fire. Under the label Nuclear Blast, they released two more albums and one EP and did a worldwide tour as well as many festivals.\n\nTriumph or Agony was released in 2006, followed by The Frozen Tears of Angels and The Cold Embrace of Fear – A Dark Romantic Symphony in 2010 and From Chaos to Eternity in 2011. Rhapsody of Fire, with Lione at its helm, went back to the studio without long time guitarist and founding member Luca Turilli, to record a new album, Dark Wings of Steel , Fabio Lione wrote all the lyrics for this record. The album was released in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, the band released the album Into the Legend , all lyrics written by Fabio Lione. After a short tour promoting the album, Lione announced on 28 September that he was parting ways with the band. From April 2017 to March 2018, he joined Turilli and his former bandmates to perform on Rhapsody's 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour.\n\nIn December 2018, Fabio Lione and Luca Turilli announced that they have formed a new band: Turilli / Lione Rhapsody. They are joined by former members Alex Holzwarth, Patrice Guers and Dominique Leurqin. They released their debut album \"Zero Gravity (Rebirth and Evolution)\" on 5 July 2019.\n\nOn 16 December 2010, the American power-metal band Kamelot announced that Lione would take over lead vocal duties for Roy Khan for the Kamelot's tour supporting their \"Poetry for the Poisoned\" release due to Khan's eventual departure from Kamelot. 70000 Tons of Metal was the last of 49 shows with them, in January 2012.\n\nIn January 2013, Fabio was again on the stage at 70000 Tons Of Metal, but this time with Brazilian progressive metal band Angra. The two shows were a great success and Fabio was again with them at the Live n' Louder Festival in São Paulo with Twisted Sister, Metal Church and Loudness. After that, the band decides to do a special tour, a commemorative one celebrating 20 years from the release of the first record \"Angels Cry\". They celebrate 20 years of career with 11 shows in Latin-America and the release of a new DVD, recorded in the last show in São Paulo.\nAfter that Angra played in Japan as co/headliner at the Loud Park festival 13 with Stone Temple Pilots and Europe and they had a very good response.\nThe commemorative tour continues with another 14 shows in Latin America and 4 shows in Europe..where the band performed at Hellfest in France..with Black Sabbath, Soundgarden, Aerosmith and more ...after that, they enter in a studio in Sweden recording a new Cd.\n\nAngra announced that the band's new release, and the first album to feature vocalist Fabio Lione, entitled \"Secret Garden\". The album was released by JVC in Asia on 17 December, via Universal Music in Brazil and Edel Music in Europe both on 16 January 2015, and then later in USA, Canada and Russia (date TBA). The album brings what the band has called \"a true renewal in the style of the band.\" With production by legendary producer Roy Z (Judas Priest, Bruce Dickinson, Halford) and was recorded and produced in Sweden by Jens Bogren (Kreator, Arch Enemy, Opeth).\n\nLione's first Eurobeat song \"Eye of the Tiger\" was released in Japan in 2000. His name for Eurobeat project was \"J. Storm\", deriving from Joey Tempest. He published thirteen Eurobeat songs (list below) under this name between 2000 and 2005 and has declared that he wouldn't be making anymore Eurobeat in the future.\nHowever, by the end of 2013 a new song was released called \"Dancing into fire\". One of his songs, \"Dancing in My Dreams\", was also used in Initial D Battle Stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The track, a NASCAR original, operated from 1949, NASCAR's inception, until the track's closure in 1996. The speedway briefly reopened in 2010 and hosted several Stock Car Series races, including the now-defunct ASA Late Model Series, USARacing Pro Cup Series, and PASS Super Late Models, before closing again in the spring of 2011. The track is located on U.S. Route 421, about five miles east of the town of North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. It measured and featured a unique uphill backstretch and downhill frontstretch.\n\nYears before the 1948 founding of NASCAR, Wilkes County and the surrounding areas were known as the Moonshine Capital of America. The local economy was pushed toward liquor after the Great Depression had stripped the profitability of farming and the region's undulating topography offered places to hide liquor stills during the Prohibition Era. Its location in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains was also convenient for distillers and distributors of moonshine. North Wilkesboro native & NASCAR driver Benny Parsons recalled of the era \"Trust me, there was nothing to do in the mountains of North Carolina back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. You either worked at a hosiery mill, a furniture factory, or you made whiskey.\"\n\nIn 1945, Enoch Staley attended a stock car race in South Carolina sponsored by Bill France. Enoch was inspired by the races and was impressed by the large crowds attending the new sport. So he decided to build a track in his native Wilkes County, and he asked Bill France to promote the races and assist with their operation.\n\nEnoch and his partners, Lawson Curry, Jack Combs, and Charlie Combs, purchased farmland near North Wilkesboro and began building an oval racetrack. When their initial investment of $1,500 was exhausted, they were forced to amend the original design of the track, hence the completed track was not a perfect oval. The front stretch was left with a downhill slope, and the backstretch had an uphill slope. Construction was completed in late 1946.\n\nNorth Wilkesboro Speedway opened its doors on May 18, 1947 as a dirt track. Bill France promoted the first official event as a Modified race, including heat races and a feature race. While an attendance of about 3,000 people was expected, a crowd in excess of 10,000 was in attendance to see one of the famous Flock brothers win the race.\n\nOn October 16, 1949, North Wilkesboro Speedway held the eighth and final race of the 1949 NASCAR Strictly Stock Division. Kenneth Wagner won the first Cup Pole at the track with a speed of 57.563 mph on the dirt surface. A total of 22 drivers competed in the race. Bob Flock, in his Bob Christian-owned 1949 Oldsmobile, passed Bill Blair's fading Cadillac with 20 laps to go and won by about 100 yards over Lee Petty. At the end of the day Robert \"Red\" Byron walked away as the first NASCAR champion.\n\nNorth Wilkesboro carried a reputation as one of the fastest short-tracks in auto racing in the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1950, speeds reached 73 mph at the track, compared to the next fastest short-track, Charlotte Speedway, where top speeds only reached 66 mph. Most of the fans in the early years of the sport saw the track as notorious for being a great venue to watch races between the legendary racers of the time. Racing at North Wilkesboro was intense and physical.\n\nThe 1950 Wilkes 200 was the second Grand National Series race held at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Twenty-six cars entered the race. Twenty-one-year-old Fireball Roberts qualified with a lap speed of 73.266 mph on the dirt track for his first ever Grand National pole, but engine problems dropped him out of the running. Fonty Flock started in the third position and led the most laps in the race with 104, but engine troubles also ended his day. Ultimately, Leon Sales led eight of the 200 laps to become the victor, the fourth NASCAR driver to win an event in his debut race. Jack Smith finished second after leading 55 laps in the race.\n\nAfter hosting only one NASCAR event in 1949 and one in 1950, the track began running two Grand National Series events per year in 1951 (with the exception of 1956, when only one race was held; the track was being prepared for pavement). One race was held in the spring, normally in late March or early April, and another was held in the fall, normally in late September or early October. In 1957, owner Enoch Stanley had the 5/8-mile track paved.\n\nThe Wilkes 200 in 1952 turned into a battle between brothers. Two sets of brothers competed in the race, and they took the top four spots at the finish. The Flock Brothers (Fonty Flock and Tim Flock) were strong, but the Thomas brothers (Herb Thomas and Donald Thomas) had the better outcome. Herb Thomas, driving his 1952 \"Fabulous\" Hudson Hornet, won the pole, led 192 of the 200 laps, and grabbed the victory. Fonty Flock led the first eight laps and finished the race second. Donald Thomas, also in a 1952 \"Fabulous\" Hudson Hornet, finished third, and Tim Flock finished fourth. Eleven of the 27 cars entered in the race finished. Six of the top nine positions were driving Hudson Hornets.\n\nHerb Thomas started on the pole for the 1953 Wilkes 200 with his record-setting qualifying speed of 78.424 mph on the dirt surface. Outside pole sitter Tim Flock led the first 100 laps before experiencing engine problems. Curtis Turner took the lead on Lap 101 and continued the lead until his car also succumbed to engine troubles nine laps later. Thomas in his Number 92 Hudson Hornet only lead 18 laps in the race but ended the race by taking his third consecutive win at North Wilkesboro. Starting from the third spot, Dick Rathmann led 70 laps and finished behind Herb Thomas. Fonty Flock managed to work his way up from the fourth starting position to the front and led three laps before dropping back and finishing third.\n\nPole sitter Buck Baker ran 78.288 mph to grab the pole for the 1953 Wilkes 160. Baker ran strong and led the most laps in the race with 80 out front before falling back into sixth position at the finish. Speedy Thompson led 25 laps, and Fonty Flock led 37. Curtis Turner led a total of 18 laps. At the end of the race, Thompson finished two laps ahead of second-place Flock. Thompson's win ended Herb Thomas and his Hudson Hornet's three-race winning streak at North Wilkesboro.\n\nAt the 1954 Wilkes County 160, Gober Sosebee won the pole with a lap speed of 78.698 mph. Sosebee led a race-high 112 laps but finished in 12th position, eight laps down. The only other leader was Dick Rathmann, who led 48 laps. Rathmann blew a tire while leading, with three laps to go, and still managed to finish and win the race. Herb Thomas finished some 20 seconds behind in second place.\n\nIn the 1954 Wilkes 160, Hershel McGriff won the pole with a qualifying speed of 77.612 mph. He and Dick Rathman were the only leaders of the race; McGriff led 74 laps, and Rathman led 83. The race was called three laps early because of a serious crash involving Lou Figaro; his car flipped, and the roof caved in. Figaro was transported to a hospital in Winston-Salem, but he died the following day from a skull fracture and brain damage suffered in the crash. McGriff was declared the winner. It was his final victory and his last Grand National race for 17 years.\n\nDink Widenhouse won his only career Grand National Series pole at the 1955 Wilkes County 160. Engine problems, however, landed Widenhouse out of the race. Outside pole sitter Buck Baker led all 160 laps, but by the last lap Dick Rathmann was glued to Baker's bumper, still charging. Rathmann's final charge off of Turn Four came up three feet short of stealing the victory. It was the closest finish in series history up to that time. Local native Junior Johnson ran in his first Grand National race at North Wilkesboro.\n\nIn 1956, the Wilkes County 160 was the only Grand National Series race of the season, and it was the last race on dirt at North Wilkesboro. Junior Johnson's 1956 Pontiac started from the pole and led the first 17 laps before engine problems sidelined him. Outside pole qualifier Speedy Thompson took over the lead from there until fuel line problems on Lap 114 forced him out of the race. Tim Flock led the final 46 laps, earning his first win at North Wilkesboro. After the race, Flock announced to Carl Kiekhafer that this would be the last time he would drive one of Kiekhafer's cars. Billy Myers was the runner-up.\n\nThe Wilkes County 160 in 1957 was dominated by the Pete DePaolo Fords. DePaolo entered five 1957 Fords in the race, and they all finished in the top six positions. Fireball Roberts put his DePaolo Ford on the pole with a qualifying speed of 81.5 mph. It was the first time the pole sitter had a speed over 80 mph. Roberts was the only driver to lead during the race, leading all 160 laps. Roberts won the race without making a single pit stop. DePaolo's other drivers were second-place finisher Paul Goldsmith, third place Ralph Moody, fourth place Marvin Panch, and sixth place Allen Adkins. Buck Baker's was the only non-Depaolo car in the top six. He finished in fifth place.\n\nThe Wilkes 160 of 1957 was Junior Johnson's first race after spending 11 months in jail for his moonshining activities. It was also his only start of the 1957 Grand National Series season. Fireball Roberts won the pole with a lap speed of 81.64 mph. Jack Smith passed Banjo Matthews with ten laps to go, holding off Lee Petty for the victory. Tragedy struck on Lap 47 when Tiny Lund's axle snapped. One of the wheels broke loose, hitting spectators. One spectator was injured, and another, William R. Thomasson, was killed.\n\nThe NASCAR Convertible Series ran two races at North Wilkesboro. In 1957, Ken Rush won the pole and led the first 21 laps before Glen Wood took the lead for the next 42 laps. Paul Goldsmith took the lead on Lap 64 and led the rest of the 160-lap race. In 1958, Roz Howard won the pole but never led a lap. Billy Myers took the lead on Lap One and continued until Lap 82 when he was passed by Gwyn Staley. Billy Myers retook the lead on Lap 119 and lead the rest of the race.\n\nIn 1959 North Wilkesboro's spring race, the Wilkes County 160, was renamed the Gwyn Staley 160 in memory of Enoch Staley's younger brother. Gwyn Staley was killed in a convertible race at Richmond 12 days before the running of the Wilkes County 160. The race remained in Gwyn Staley's name until 1978. Lee Petty won the inaugural Gwyn Staley 160, His first North Wilkesboro win, driving a Petty Enterprises #43 car. It was his only victory driving a #43 car, a number later made famous by his son Richard Petty.\n\nThrough the 1960s and 1970s the NASCAR Grand National Series began focusing on bigger, faster, and longer tracks. Like other short tracks in NASCAR at the time, crowd capacity and purses were small compared to the larger tracks. Over time, Enoch Staley and Jack Combs attempted to keep the facility modern and on pace with the growth of the sport. The West Grandstand was rebuilt with chair-type seats rather than the old bare concrete slabs. New larger restroom facilities were built, and the South Grandstand was expanded. A garage facility was also built within the track, which at the time was rare for short-track venues. But the main focus was on keeping ticket prices affordable. Food and beverage prices were kept low, and event parking and camping were always free. As long as profits covered maintenance costs, Staley was satisfied with the income of the track.\n\nIn the Gwyn Staley 160 of 1960, Junior Johnson beat 21 other drivers for the pole position with a lap speed of 83.860 mph. Glen Wood overtook Johnson to lead the first lap, but Johnson had the race under control and led the next 145 laps. Lee Petty moved up from the eighth starting position to challenge Johnson late in the race. With 14 laps remaining, Johnson and Petty made contact. Johnson's car was sent spinning into the guardrail. Petty lead the final 14 laps to win his third straight race at North Wilkesboro. The crowd of 9,200 pelted Petty with bottles, rocks, and debris after his win; he had done their local hero wrong. When Petty took the microphone in Victory Lane to explain his side of the story, the crowd began jeering. Rex White finished second, and Wood placed third. Ned Jarrett finished fourth under the alias John Lentz.\n\nThe length of the fall race in 1960 was increased from its usual 160 laps / 100 miles to 320 laps / 200 miles, this it became known as the Wilkes 320. Speeds increased immensely from the previous record, 1.83 seconds quicker than any previous qualifying lap (86.806 to 93.399 mph). Rex White posted the fastest qualifying lap and dethroned Lee Petty from his three-race winning streak at North Wilkesboro. Junior Johnson finished about half a lap behind White in second place.\n\nIn the 1961 running of the Gwyn Staley 400, Junior Johnson recorded another pole, this time by 0.57 seconds better than the previous track record, with his qualifying time of 23.52 (95.660 mph). Johnson led all of the 62 laps he ran before transmission problems forced him out of the race. Fred Lorenzen led the next 61 laps until engine problems took him out of the running. And Curtis Turner led 56 laps before experiencing problems as well. 1960 Grand National Champion Rex White, who started on the outside pole, led the remaining 221 laps and won the race. Tommy Irwin started the race in sixth position and finished the Gwyn Staley 400 two laps behind White. Richard Petty followed in third place. Fireball Roberts, in a Pontiac owned by Smokey Yunick, finished fourth (ten laps down), and Johnny Allen, who crashed out of the race on his 387th lap, still finished in fifth place. Only 12 of the 25 cars that entered the race were running at the finish of the first 400-lap edition of the Gwyn Staley race.\n\nIn the 1963 Wilkes 400, Fred Lorenzen captured his third straight pole at the track by breaking his own record with a lap time of 23.30 seconds / 96.566 mph. Richard Petty entered the race in an attempt to become the first driver to win four consecutive races at North Wilkesboro. But he experienced engine problems and lasted only 45 laps into the race. Lorenzen led 58 laps, but came up short of victory, six seconds behind winner Marvin Panch. Panch did not start the 1963 season until halfway through because he had nearly lost his life in a crash while testing a Maserati at Daytona that February. Panch, in a Wood Brothers car, started third and led 131 laps in the race. Holman-Moody took the next three spots in the final rundown, with Lorenzen second, Nelson Stacy third, and Fireball Roberts fourth. Stacy started fourth and led 56 laps, while Roberts started from the outside pole and led the most laps with 155.\n\nThe track was repaved just prior to the Gwyn Staley 400 in 1964, and the resulting lack of traction wreaked havoc. Fireball Roberts, Buck Baker, Buddy Arrington, and G.C. Spencer all crashed through the wooden guardrail in the first and second turns in Saturday's practice and qualifying. Roberts was unable to start the race because his Ford had been so heavily damaged. Fred Lorenzen won the pole and led 368 laps on the way to the win.\n\nJunior Johnson was the pole sitter for the 1965 Gwyn Staley 400, with a qualifying time and speed of 22.27 seconds / 101.033 mph, breaking his own record by 0.06 seconds. Marvin Panch was leading the race when a blown tire caused him to crash with 11 laps remaining. Johnson assumed the lead from there and won his third of 13 wins in 1965. Johnson lead during most of the race, 356 laps in total. Bobby Johns in a Holman-Moody Ford finished in the runner-up position, seven seconds behind Johnson. Finishing third, one lap down, was Ned Jarrett. Jarrett had led 20 laps early in the race. Dick Hutcherson, in his Holman-Moody Ford, finished seven laps off the pace in fourth place, and Panch finished fifth. Panch led on three occasions during the race for a total of 24 laps.\n\nIn the Wilkes 400 of 1965, Fred Lorenzen won the pole and led the first 190 laps before engine problems forced him out of the race on Lap 219. Junior Johnson took the lead from the fading Lorenzen to pick up his 50th and final Grand National Series victory by two laps over Cale Yarborough. Only 16 of the 35 cars that entered the race were running at the finish.\n\nJim Paschal started the 1966 Gwyn Staley 400 from the pole position with a record lap time and speed of 21.91 sec / 102.693 mph. Paschal led 308 laps and won by six laps over G.C. Spencer, the largest margin of victory at North Wilkesboro in a Grand National Series race. David Pearson started on the outside pole, and despite losing an engine with 18 laps to go he finished third. Wendell Scott finished fourth (22 laps down), and Clarence Henly Gray finished fifth (25 laps down). Only 14 of the 37 cars entered in the race were running at the finish. Richard Petty was the only driver besides Paschal to lead any laps in the race. He led 92 laps before falling back to finish 11th (53 laps down).\n\nDarel Dieringer completely dominated the 1967 Gwyn Staley 400, driving for Junior Johnson. Dieringer got the pole with a lap of 21.50 seconds / 104.693 mph and lead all 400 laps. He was the first driver to run a Grand National Series race of over 250 miles while leading from start to finish. He lapped the whole field twice at one point. Dieringer took the checked flag after he ran out of gas in Turn Four of the last lap and coasted to the finish line. This was Dieringer's last Grand National victory. Cale Yarborough, driving the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford, finished second, one lap behind Dieringer. A 20-lap qualifying race to make the field was won by Clyde Lynn.\n\nIn the Wilkes 400 of 1967, Richard Petty achieved an historic tenth straight win, his 27th win of the season, at North Wilkesboro. Prior to the start of the race, Petty's car had a flat tire, but he was able to recover and win by two laps over pole winner Dick Hutcherson. Only 15 of the 35 cars that started the race were able to finish.\n\nThree drivers entered the 1970 Wilkes 400 in a very close points race. Bobby Isaac was just ahead of James Hylton, and Bobby Allison was close behind. But Richard Petty, who was out of the points because of a shoulder injury suffered at Darlington in May, was considered the favorite to win the race. Isaac started from the pole for a record-tying fourth consecutive time, matching Fred Lorenzen and Herb Thomas with a qualifying lap time of 21.346 seconds / 105.406 mph. Fans were given quite a show as Isaac and Petty exchanged the lead a total of 11 times throughout the race. Isaac, in the Nord Krauskopf's K&K Insurance Dodge, led 179 laps and took the win by six car lengths over Petty. Petty, who had started the race in third position led the most laps in the race with 216. Bobby Allison started fourth and finished fourth behind his brother, Donnie Allison. And Hylton finished fifth at the end of day. Isaac advanced to become the 1970 Winston Cup Champion at season's end, with Allison being the runner-up in points.\n\nBad weather in 1971 caused the Wilkes 400 to be postponed to November 21. Due to the Grand National Series' struggling car counts, cars from NASCAR's Grand American Series were allowed to run in this race. Charlie Glotzbach broke the track record in qualifying at 20.919 seconds / 107.558 mph. It was the first lap ever run under 21 seconds at North Wilkesboro, ending Bobby Isaac's run of five consecutive poles at the track. Tiny Lund, driving a 1970 Camaro, qualified sixth and led just seven laps on his way to the victory. Lund also won another race driving the Camaro that season at Hickory. Glotzbach finished second, six seconds behind Lund, after leading 76 laps in the race. Richard Petty started from the outside pole and led 306 laps to finish third. Dave Marcis finished fourth, two laps down, and Benny Parsons rounded out the top five. Bobby Allison was the only other driver to lead, running 11 laps out front before losing an engine prior to the half.\n\nThe Wilkes 400 in 1972 was one of the wildest finishes in NASCAR Cup Series history. Buddy Baker won the pole in the No. 71 K&K Insurance Dodge owned by Nord Krauskopf, but he only led the first lap of the race. Richard Petty and Bobby Allison swapped the lead for the rest of the race, beating and banging each other for the win. At times was more of a demolition derby than a race. Both cars were destroyed by the end, with Allison's car noticeably smoking. This was the peak of the Petty-Allison rivalry. Petty was declared the winner, but in Victory Lane, a fan tried to attack him. But he was defended by his helmet-wielding brother, Maurice Petty. This was Richard Petty's last of 137 wins in a Plymouth.\n\nIn the Gwyn Staley 400 of 1973, Bobby Allison landed on the pole with a qualifying lap of 21.077 seconds / 106.750 MPH. Richard Petty qualified on the outside pole, and in dominating fashion he led 386 laps, winning by over four laps. It was Petty's tenth career win at North Wilkesboro and his 151st career NASCAR victory. Benny Parsons led six laps and finished second. Buddy Baker finished third in the No. 71 K&K Insurance Dodge owned by Nord Krauskopf. Allison lead seven laps and finished fourth in the race. Cecil Gordon rounded out the top five finishers. Yvon DuHamel, a top AMA road racer from Quebec, drove a Mercury prepared by Junie Donlavey and finished in tenth place in his only career Cup race. Twenty of the 30 cars that entered the race were running at the finish.\n\nIn the Wilkes 400 of 1973 Bobby Allison, driving for his own No. 12 Coca-Cola team, won the pole position. He and Richard Petty led most of the race, Allison with 161 and Petty with 222. As Petty led the race late, Allison pitted and got fresh tires on a late pit stop, running down Petty and passing him on the final lap. It was considered as one of the most exciting races ever at North Wilkesboro Speedway.\n\nIn 1975 the NASCAR Baby Grand Series, later known as Goody's Dash Series, ran its first race at North Wilkesboro, with a win by Dean Combs. Thirty-seven races were run at the track from 1975-1984,1986-1987, and 1995-1996. Dean Combs had the most wins at the track with 15 victories.\n\nIn the Gwyn Staley 400 of 1977, Cale Yarborough became the first driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race on his birthday. Neil Bonnett beat Yarborough for the pole, but in the race Yarborough led 320 laps on the way to his birthday victory. Only the top three, Yarborough, Richard Petty and Benny Parsons finished on the lead lap.\n\nIn the Wilkes 400 of 1978, Darrell Waltrip won the pole in his No. 88 Gatorade DiGard team Chevrolet. Waltrip led the first 381 laps of the 400-lap race. But with 19 laps remaining, Cale Yarborough passed Waltrip and took the win. Yarborough and Waltrip were the only drivers to finish on the lead lap in the 27-car field. This ninth win of the season for Yarborough virtually locked his third straight NASCAR Cup Series championship driving for car owner Junior Johnson.\n\nIn the Northwestern Bank 400 of 1979, Benny Parsons won the pole. Richard Petty led the most laps with 211, but it was Bobby Allison who passed Petty and led the final 47 laps. The suspension on Allison's No. 15 Ford collapsed as he crossed the finish line on the final lap of the race, leading to a smokey victory lap as the car threw sparks. But by that time he had already won and was headed to Victory Lane. Dale Earnhardt tied for fourth, his best finish at that point in his career. He won his first race in the very next event at Bristol.\n\nThe Holly Farms 400 in 1979 was the first time the fall race had a sponsor. Holly Farms would be the name of the track's fall races from this event until the track's final race in 1996. The race was scheduled to be run September 30, but heavy rains and worms seeping onto the track surface plagued the entire weekend. So the race was rescheduled for the next available weekend, October 14. Dale Earnhardt broke the 20-second barrier during qualifying and claimed the pole position. With a new asphalt surface on the track, 14 drivers ended up topping the previous qualifying record. Bobby Allison led the most laps in the race with 175, and Darrell Waltrip led 104. After Waltrip bumped Allison out of the lead, Waltrip was wrecked on Lap 311, when Allison put him into the wall. Waltrip began crowding out Allison under the caution before officials black-flagged him. Wilkes County local, Benny Parsons, ended the day in Victory Lane after leading the final 92 laps. It was Parsons' first and only win at his hometown track.\n\nDuring the 1980s the track was noticeably lagging behind other speedways on the NASCAR circuit, but the fans were more interested in the great racing action between the legendary drivers. Enoch's focus was more on the fans' enjoyment rather than on building large suites and new facilities. Attendance and total purse for races at the track were the lowest in NASCAR, but the events continued to sell out and attract more fans each year.\n\nIn the 1981 Northwestern Bank 400, Dave Marcis, driving an unpainted car, won the pole with a lap record of 19.483 sec / 115.485 mph on the newly repaved track. The lap was 0.241 seconds faster than the previous record set by Dale Earnhardt one year earlier. A 22-year-old newcomer, Mark Martin, made his NASCAR Cup Series debut with a quick qualifying run, starting fifth. But he ended up dropping out 166 laps into the race with rear end problems and finished 27th. Bobby Allison was up front, leading the most laps with 186. Marcis stayed up front and led 123 laps but fell off the pace late in the race when his tires wore out. Richard Petty took the lead and led the final 62 laps for his 194th career win. This was Petty's 15th and final win at North Wilkesboro, the most Cup wins at the track. It was also Petty's 107th and final win on a short track. The top five finishers behind Petty were Allison, Darrell Waltrip, Marcis, and Harry Gant.\n\nDarrell Waltrip dominated the Holly Farms 400 of 1981. He started on the pole, leading 318. He lapped the field on the way to the win, beginning a streak of five straight wins at the track. Bobby Allison finished second, one lap down after leading 76 laps. Other leaders in the race were Jody Ridley leading four laps, Dave Marcis with one lap, and Richard Petty with one.\n\nThe Northwestern Bank 400 of 1982 was ESPN's first broadcast at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Bob Jenkins and Ned Jarrett called the race, with Ron Kendrick as the pit reporter. They broadcast every North Wilkesboro race afterward until the final race there in the fall of 1996. Bobby Hillin Jr., at 17 years old, made his first career start and set the record for the youngest driver (A 1998 rule change raised the minimum age in NASCAR to 18, meaning this record is unlikely to be broken) to start a NASCAR Winston Cup race. Darrell Waltrip won the race from the pole, leading 345 laps.\n\nThe 1982 Holly Farms 400 was a total domination by Darrell Waltrip and the Junior Johnson team. Waltrip started the weekend by gaining his third straight pole at the track with a qualifying lap of 19.761 sec / 113.860 mph. He led 329 laps in the race. Bobby Allison was the only driver who could stay close to the No. 11 team. As the only other leader in the race, Allison led 71 laps but was forced out by engine problems after 141 laps. Only Waltrip and Harry Gant finished the race on the lead lap. It was Waltrip's third straight NASCAR Cup Series win at North Wilkesboro.\n\nIn the spring of 1983, NASCAR ran its first Busch race at North Wilkesboro. Tommy Ellis won the pole with a qualifying speed of 116.692 mph. Ellis led the first 15 laps before being passed by Butch Lindley. Sam Ard got the lead from Lindley on Lap 34 and led the rest of the 200-lap race. Only ten of the 23 cars finished the race. That fall, Phil Parsons won the pole for the second Busch race. Jack Ingram led a race-high 126 laps, but Tommy Ellis took the win. Only one event was held in 1984, with Sam Ard winning his final Busch race. Tommy Houston won the pole in 1985 for the last Busch race, with Jack Ingram taking the win.\n\nDarrell Waltrip and Junior Johnson enjoyed a big win in the 1983 Holly Farms 400. It was Waltrip's fifth straight win at the track and Johnson's 100th career NASCAR Cup Series win as an owner, which just happened to take place at his home track within ten miles of his home and farm. Waltrip got the pole and led 252 laps on the way to victory. Dale Earnhardt was runner-up in the race with 134 laps out front.\n\nThe Northwestern Bank 400 of 1984 was dominated by Ricky Rudd, who got the pole and led 290 laps. But at the end of the race, Tim Richmond had a better pit stop to beat Ricky Rudd out of the win. Richmond's victory broke Darrell Waltrip's five-race winning streak at North Wilkesboro.\n\nIn the 1986 First Union 400, Geoffrey Bodine started on the pole. On Lap 85, Trevor Boys crashed out of the race and blocked the entrance to Pit Road, but no caution flag was thrown. Instead, a wrecker was sent out on the bottom of the track to haul Boys out of the way under green-flag conditions. Dale Earnhardt won the race and led 195 laps, followed by Ricky Rudd in second place with 102.\n\nThe Holly Farms 400 of 1988 was a rough race. Ricky Rudd led 154 laps, and Dale Earnhardt led 107. A beating and banging match started between them, and NASCAR sent them both to the rear of the field with less than 40 laps to go. For the remainder of the race they continued to beat and bang on each other. On the last lap, Geoffrey Bodine gave Rusty Wallace a shot and drove around him in Turn One. But when the two got around to Turn Three, Wallace returned the shot and passed Bodine for the win.\n\nThe 1989 First Union 400 was the first NASCAR Cup Series race for Goodyear radial tires. Dale Earnhardt won the race on the Goodyear tires after Rusty Wallace grabbed the pole on Hoosier bias ply tires. Earnhardt led 296 out of 400 laps. In the end, Earnhardt and Alan Kulwicki battled it out hard for the last couple of laps until Kulwicki ran up the track trying to pass Earnhardt on the outside with four laps left.\n\nIn the 1989 Holly Farms 400, Dale Earnhardt entered the race only 35 points behind Rusty Wallace for the NASCAR Cup Series championship with four races left. The race was originally scheduled for October 1, but rain caused a two-week postponement. Earnhardt got the pole position because inclement weather had washed out the qualifying runs. This is the only Cup race at North Wilkesboro to start without qualifiers. Earnhardt dominated the race, leading 343 laps. On the final restart on Lap 398, Earnhardt led Ricky Rudd, Geoff Bodine, Terry Labonte, and Mark Martin. Rudd was in pursuit of Earnhardt on the last lap going into the first turn. He went low, and Earnhardt tried to keep a tight line through the corner to hold the lead. They made contact and both cars went spinning, as Geoff Bodine went around to gap the win by leading only the last lap in the race. The last-lap contact also produced some of the most memorable broadcasting quotes in NASCAR history. After the race, Dick Berggren asked Earnhardt, \"How will this affect your championship? You've got three more to go.\" Earnhardt responded, \"What do ya think? They oughta fine that son of a bitch and make him sit out the rest of the year, I dunno.\" Earnhardt ended up losing the championship by 12 points to Wallace.\n\nBy the 1990s, North Wilkesboro was like a part of the past. Enoch had always had the fans' interests at heart, and he was reluctant to raise ticket and concession prices or charge spectators additional fees to make facility improvements. Track amenities were seen as out-of-date and lagging behind the other more modern facilities. Parking was overcrowded and tight, traffic jams plagued the two-lane roads leading to the facility, and hotel and motel rooms were hard to find in the area. NASCAR crowds and TV contracts had outgrown the Speedway. NASCAR had continued to expand and grow more in the economy. Bigger TV deals and larger coverage of the races and new, bigger sponsors were growing in the sport, as North Wilkesboro races continued with the lowest crowd capacity, 60,000 in its best years, in all of the Winston Cup Series. Winners purses were normally still under $100,000.\n\nControversy erupted at the end of the 1990 First Union 400. Mark Martin had started the race from the pole, and Darrell Waltrip was in the lead when a caution came out late for Kenny Wallace right as the last round of green flag pit stops was completed. Brett Bodine was on the tail-end of the lead lap. Since NASCAR didn't have electronic scoring until 1993, the pace car picked Brett Bodine up as the leader. The next 17 laps were run under the yellow, while the officials checked the lap charts and tried to sort everything out. By the time NASCAR realized its mistake and waved the rest of the field around the pace car to fall in behind race leader Bodine, Bodine had already pitted and gotten four fresh tires under yellow during all the confusion. Bodine was able to stay out front with the freshest tires. He led the rest of the race after the green came back out and picked up the win. Darrell Waltrip was very upset after the race and protested Bodine's win, but NASCAR declined the protest and Bodine keep the win. It turned out to be Bodine's only career win and Larry McReynolds' first oval track win as a crew chief after two road course victories with Ricky Rudd in the late 1980s. It was also the last Winston Cup Series win for Buick.\n\nDale Earnhardt dominated the 1990 Tyson Holly Farms 400, leading 291 laps. At one point, Earnhardt even passed Mark Martin for the lead down Pit Road to beat him out of the pits. No Pit Road speed limit was in place at the time. Kyle Petty had won the pole and led 64 laps early in the race. But in the end, Martin made a key adjustment on his last pit stop. He took off and ran away to gain the victory. Just hours after the race, rookie Rob Moroso was killed in a highway crash on the way home. Moroso became the only rookie to win the Winston Cup Series Rookie of the Year honors posthumously.\n\nIn the 1991 First Union 400, Brett Bodine beat Alan Kulwicki for the pole. This was the first Winston Cup race held with a Pit Road speed limit. Dale Earnhardt spun early due to contact from Ricky Rudd, but he was able to make his way back to the front. Brett Bodine ran a very strong race and looked to be in contention for a second consecutive First Union 400 until he was spun in Turn Three by Ricky Rudd. Geoff Bodine was black-flagged for making contact with Davey Allison after the two had spun in Turn Four. Allison had escaped without damage in the first incident, but contact from Bodine after the caution damaged his right front fender. Jimmy Spencer seemed to have the car to beat, at one point leading 70 laps. Darrell Waltrip ended the long day in Victory Lane, winning his first race as a driver/owner since his early days in the 1970s. It was his 80th career win. This race had the record for most cautions in a Cup race at North Wilkesboro Speedway, with 17 cautions.\n\nHarry Gant was looking to make history in the 1991 Tyson Holly Farms 400. After winning four straight Cup wins at Darlington, Richmond, Dover, and Martinsville, a win at North Wilkesboro would be a modern-era record of five straight wins in the Winston Cup Series. He had also won both Busch races that he had run in that period. Gant beat Davey Allison for the pole and also had a chance to earn the Unocal bonus, totaling $144,400, if he could win from the pole. Gant looked like he would get the record all day, staying out front and leading 350 laps until late in the race when he began experiencing brake problems. With nine laps to go, Dale Earnhardt passed Gant on the high side and went on to take the checkered flag. Gant still held on to a second-place finish, but his chance at making history was over.\n\nIn the 1992 First Union 400, Davey Allison beat Rusty Wallace and drove to victory with broken ribs. He had broken his ribs in a hard crash at Bristol the week before. Alan Kulwicki won the pole and led the most laps with 182. Davey Allison maintained his early Winston Cup Series season points lead.\n\nThe 1992 Tyson Holly Farms 400 was the last time a Winston Cup Series race went without a single caution flag on a track less than one mile in length. It was the last caution-free race until 1997 at Talladega. The race was run on a Monday after rain showers had postponed it on Sunday. Alan Kulwicki won the pole again, sweeping both poles at the track for the season. Geoffrey Bodine won the race that ended with only two drivers on the lead lap, Bodine and Terry Labonte. Bodine led 312 laps in the race driving the Number 15 Bud Moore Ford.\n\nIn the First Union 400 in 1994, Terry Labonte got his first Winston Cup Series win since 1989 and his first win driving for Rick Hendrick in the Number Five Kellogg Chevy. Ernie Irvan started from the pole with a track record speed of 119.016 mph and dominated most of the day, leading 320 laps in the 400-lap race before a pit stop miscue cost him the win. He was only able to make it back up to third position, and Labonte beat Rusty Wallace for the win.\n\nThe Tyson Holly Farms 400 that fall was a runaway for Geoffrey Bodine, who is the last Winston Cup Series driver to win by lapping the entire field. Jimmy Spencer started on the pole and led the first five laps. Bodine started 18th and cut through the field and into the Top Ten by Lap Five. Bodine led 334 out of 400 laps. This was the last win for Hoosier's Tire in the Winston Cup Series; they withdrew from the series after NASCAR made new rules for the 1995 season with more requirements from tire companies.\n\nEnoch Staley died of a stroke on May 22, 1995. Less than one month later, Speedway Motorsports, Inc. CEO Bruton Smith purchased fifty percent of the shares of the speedway from the Combs family. Smith had approached the Staley family prior to and after the death of Enoch in 1995. The family declined to sell to him because Enoch had distrusted Smith and had instructed the family never to sell the track to him. After this, it was decided that Smith and Mike Staley, Enoch's son, would have equal representation on the track. Mike Staley was installed as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Speedway for a one-year term.\n\nThe 1995 fall race weekend included the first NASCAR Supertrack race at the track and the return of Ernie Irvan to the Cup racing. Irvan had not raced since his near fatal crash at Michigan in 1994. He made his first start in a truck on Saturday, starting on the outside front row. He led 24 laps before suspension problems forced him to pull out of the race just after the halfway break. Kenny Wallace, Jack Sprague, and Geoff Bodine all ran strong up front at some point, but Mike Bliss went on to score his first-ever truck win. On Sunday in the Tyson Holly Farms 400, Irvan, driving a Number 88 Robert Yates Racing Ford, started seventh and finished sixth with a 31-lap lead. Mark Martin picked up his second win at the track. This was the first Winston Cup Series race since 1959 with all the cars running at the finish. There were 28 lead changes in this race, a record for North Wilkesboro Cup races.\n\nOn January 1, 1996, the fifty-percent interest in North Wilkesboro Speedway owned by the Staley family was sold to racetrack developer and promoter Bob Bahre, owner of New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Mike Staley said that selling the track was very painful, but it was the only choice he had. Both Bahre and Bruton Smith already owned several NASCAR circuits. They announced their intent to use the spring and fall race dates for their own tracks, citing North Wilkesboro Speedway's age and lack of modern amenities. They said, \"cash rules everything around us.\"\n\nIn the 1996 First Union 400, Terry Labonte won the pole, led the most laps, and won the race while tying Richard Petty's Iron-man streak of 513 consecutive starts. He also collected a bonus of $129,200 from the Unocal 76 Challenge Award for the race by winning from the pole. His car was painted silver to commemorate his record streak. The race attracted over 60,000 race fans. Many of them thought this would be the last race held at the Speedway since Bahre had enough time to organize a race at his New Hampshire International Speedway.\n\nThe 1996 Tyson Holly Farms 400 was the last Winston Cup Series race held at the track. Junior Johnson refused to attend the last race weekend stating \"I'm not going. It would be more of a sad deal for me to go out and just stand around and look at something disappear, something I can remember almost since I've been around.\" Bruton Smith needed extra security for the weekend for own protection. Most of the hostile race fans viewed him as the reason for the track's closure. Ted Musgrave got the last pole with a lap speed of 118.054 mph. This was the last Cup race to have fewer than 40 cars start until the 2016 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta, where only 39 cars showed up. Eight drivers led laps in the race, with Jeff Gordon leading most of the event with 207 laps up front. Gordon won the race in front of a record crowd over runner-up Dale Earnhardt. Every car that started this race was running at the finish. Most of the fans remained in the stands long after the race was over, holding on to memories of the track.\n\nThe track was closed after the fall race of 1996. North Wilkesboro's spring date was moved to Smith's new Texas Motor Speedway. The fall date was taken over by Bahre's New Hampshire track and moved to early September as part of a schedule realignment. Since the sale to Bahre and Smith, there have been attempts to buy the track and reopen it. Some long-time fans still meet at the track on former race weekends to reminisce and renew old acquaintances.\n\nIn early 2003, Junior Johnson and a group of investors considered purchasing the speedway. Johnson speculated that the track could be used for all levels of NASCAR minor-league racing series. A driving school and a test track for the Cup series were others proposed uses for the track. However, in 2004 due to disputes between the two owners, numerous repairs needed, and economic obstacles, Johnson deemed any track purchase highly unlikely.\n\nIn October 2003, local realtor Robert Glen started a petition to return racing to North Wilkesboro Speedway. Glen asserted that the speedway's absence was hurting the local economy. \"People are losing their jobs, and they're losing their homes. You mention the speedway, and you see a glimmer of hope in their eyes. That racetrack is a crown jewel of Wilkes County . . . . this as a catalyst for bringing in new business and jobs to Wilkes.\" The petition asked county commissioners to condemn the Speedway and, through power of eminent domain, sell to an investor that would repurpose the facility for auto racing. There were 3,313 signatures on the petition. However, county officials decided condemnation of the property was not the best option.\n\nDuring the fall of 2004, Roush Racing had its \"Race for the Ride\" testing session for its \"\" television show. Twenty-six drivers, including Justin Allgaier, Erik Darnell, Matt McCall, Danny O'Quinn, and David Ragan, competed for a chance to earn a ride in the 2005 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. The Roush Racing team asserted that North Wilkesboro Speedway would be a great place for testing young talent because \"it's a driver's track\" and because none of the drivers had ever raced there, everyone would have an equal shot.\n\nSTS Motorsports, Inc., a group founded in 2005 by Rob Marsden, has been trying to bring racing back to North Wilkesboro Speedway. The group began a petition and caught the attention of current owners, Smith and Bahre. The track was valued by county tax assessors at $4.83 million. The owners eventually agreed to sell for $12 million. No sale was made.\n\nSave the Speedway spent the fall and winter of 2005 attempting to find a buyer or buyers for the track as well as proving that there was still interest in racing at the facility. Over a dozen touring series had written letters of intent to hold events should the Speedway be reopened. Three driving schools and several NASCAR teams showed interest in using the facility for testing.\n\nIn 2006 Save The Speedway worked with a New York real estate developer in an attempt to rally investors, but parted ways when neither party could come to an agreement. As of 2007, the group had not yet found investors to purchase the track.\n\nIn January 2007 during the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Media Tour, Bruton Smith announced that he and co-owner Bob Bahre had agreed to let a real estate company attempt to sell the track for the asking price of $12 million. On September 28, 2007, Worth Mitchell, a land developer, announced plans to purchase the speedway. However, Worth Mitchell estimated his odds at 50–50 of completing the deal, and since that time there has been no further information. Speedway Motorsports officials had no comment on the negotiations.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, Bahre sold his share of North Wilkesboro Speedway to Smith as part of Smith's deal to buy Bahre's New Hampshire Motor Speedway.\n\nSave the Speedway applied for a highway history marker. It was approved at the May meeting of the NC Highway Historical Marker Advisory Committee. North Carolina Office of Archives and History dedicated the placement of the marker on May 24, 2008 at 2:00 pm. The plaque reads:\n\nNORTH WILKESBORO SPEEDWAY\n\nPioneer NASCAR dirt track. Built 1946; paved in 1958. Hosted sanctioned events, 1949-96. 5/8 mile oval . W.\n\nOn October 31, 2009, Jayski.com announced that the USAR ProCup Series would host an event at North Wilkesboro Speedway on October 3, 2010. Also in 2010, the track hosted the ASA Late Model Series for the King's Ransom 300 and the PASS Late Models. In 2009 it was announced that Save The Speedway would partner with Speedway Associates to work on the speedway during their lease. On January 7, 2010, the track announced that there would be a PASS Super Late Models race April 7–9, 2011, which would be a 300-lap race for $153,000 in winnings. They also announced that the Buck Baker Driving School would be the official driving school of NWS. The track announced sponsorship from Goodyear.\n\nAt the Labor Day Classic 200 on September 4, 2010 Chase Elliott, son of Bill Elliott, won his second PASS victory of his career. This was the first race at the track since 1996. Chase led twice for a total of 69 laps in the 200-lap green flag event. Donnie and Bobby Allison returned to the track as Grand Marshalls for the event, which also held races for Stadium Stock, Limited Late Models, and Allison Legacy.\n\nThe Brushy Mountain 250 was the 12th USAR Pro Cup event of the 2010 season. The race was ran on October 3, 2010. Jeff Agnew won the pole with a 110.996 mph lap. 20 cars started the event that was the first major race held at North Wilkesboro since the track was dropped from the Cup schedule after 1996. Jeff Agnew led 104 of the 250 laps and won the race over runner up Clay Rogers by 0.775 of a second. A modified race was also ran at the event with Jason Myers winning.\n\nThe ASA Late Model Series ran the King's Ransom 300 on October 31, 2010. Jeff Choquette won the pole, but Kyle Beattie started on the pole for the 150-lap Kings Ransom event after a full-field inversion to start the race. Brian Ortiz beat Beattie to the lead and led the first 11 laps until Brent Downey caught and passed him on Lap 12. Choquette had flown through the field and eventually passed Downey for the lead on Lap 20. Choquette held the lead until the halfway break. Drivers came down Pit Road for a ten-minute break to make adjustments and get new tires for the second half of the race. The lineup for the second segment of the race had the top six cars inverted, putting Ortiz as the leader for the start of the second half. Ortiz led until Lap 107, when Choquette ran back up through the field and took the lead. Choquette led the rest of the way to the victory, as Sean Bass and Tanner Berryhill came in second and third respectively. This was Choquette's third win in the last four Sunoco National Tour races. In the other races, Becca Kasten was black-flagged for jumping the final restart, giving the win to Matt McCall in the 150-lap Late Model Stock race. Justin Sorrow held off Gary Davis in a thrilling photo finish to win the 100-lap Limited Late Model race, and Wayne Harrington won the UCAR 40-lap race. The Short Track Shootout was held the day before with Cale Gale winning the Rolling Thunder Modifieds Series race. Alan Carter won the USST Super Trucks Series race, and Tyler Hill won the Allison Legacy Series race.\n\nThe 2011 season-opener, the Pro All Stars Series (PASS) South, presented by J. E. Pistons and Roush Yates Performance Products, \"The Race\" was the country's richest short-track race ever. Seventy-seven drivers showed up to try to make the 44-car field and try to win the $75,000 winner's purse. It was the first-ever race held under the lights at the track, but severe storms forced postponement of the race, which resulted in the race not ending under the lights.\n\nQualifying, heat races, and a couple of last chance events were used to set the 44-car field. Drivers from 21 states and five Canadian provinces had showed up to try to make the field. On Friday, Stephen Nasse won the fast time with a new track record of 18.700 seconds. The fastest 15 during qualifying locked themselves into the field. The top ten drivers then had to redraw for their starting positions in the race. Five 25-lap heat races were run that evening, with the top three drivers in each race transferring into the race. On Saturday, two 40-lap last chance races were run, with only the winners transferring into the race. Ten provisionals were given from the PASS series, and Geoff Bodine and Sterling Marlin were added to the field as North Wilkesboro Speedway track provisionals.\n\nBefore \"The Race,\" a 100-lap modified race was run. Jimmy Zacharias dominated the first half of the event. Zacharias had a half-lap lead over the field by the first yellow flag on Lap 16. Jason Myers moved up and challenged Zacharias hard for the lead before the competition caution flew at halfway. After the teams made adjustments during the break, Zacharias and Jason Myers led the field to the green, when Zacharias again took off with the lead. On Lap 75, the yellow flag flew again, and all the leaders pitted to make final adjustments and set up for a 25-lap dash to the finish. Randy Butner and Gary Putnam led the field on the restart with Zacharias in the back after his pit stop. Junior Miller would soon take over the lead as Zacharias' car appeared to be losing grip after running hard to charge back up to the front. After a yellow on Lap 90, Zacharias and Jason Myers pitted for more adjustments. Miller took the restart and never looked back, taking the 100-lap Modified victory.\n\nThe main race started with Johnny Clark and Jay Fogleman on the front row. Clark was able get out front and lead the first lap of the race. Andy Loden, Augie Grill, Bubba Pollard, and Jody Lavender led in the first segment of the race. An eight-minute break was given for teams to work on their cars and change four tires to prep them for the second segment. Pollard took the lead on the restart and continued to lead until just prior to the Lap 200 end-of-segment break, when Chris Eggleston worked his way to the lead. At the break, team once again put four new tires on and made adjustments for the last segment. Pollard jumped to the lead quickly at the start the last segment. With 50 laps remaining, Pollard and Eggleston ran hard-nose to tail through lapped traffic. On Lap 276, Pollard appeared to try to get under Clark off Turn Four and got sideways, allowing Eggleston to drive around on the high side and take the lead. Over the final laps of the caution-free segment, Eggleston was able to pull away from Pollard. At the end of 300 laps of racing, Eggleston took the checkered flag to win the historic event. Pollard had finished runner-up but was disqualified after post race technical inspection. Jeff Choquette was bumped up to second place, with T.J. Reaid, Ben Rowe, and Andy Loden filling out the top five. Other notable drivers in the field were Ryan Blaney (sixth), Ross Kenseth (seventh), Cale Gale (12th), Erik Darnell (18th), Geoff Bodine (36th), Kenzie Ruston (37th), Gray Gaulding (39th), and Sterling Marlin (43rd). However, after the April 2011 race at the Speedway, Save The Speedway said it would cease working with Speedway Associates and would no longer assist with the Speedway.\n\nIn April 2020, NASCAR and iRacing announced that by June, they will recreate the North Wilkesboro Speedway track for iRacing. Rumors surfaced in early May that the track could be ready for use by the eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series prior to its official release date, with confirmation coming during the Fox broadcast of the Pro Invitational event on Dover International Speedway. Due to popular demand, the track was made available to the public on May 11, 2020.\n\nNorth Wilkesboro Speedway has been featured in several NASCAR-related video games, including \"NASCAR Racing\", \"NASCAR Racing 2\", \"NASCAR Racing 3\", \"NASCAR Racing 4\", \"NASCAR Racing 2003 Season,\" and \"NASCAR Heat\" \"as an add-on track that can be downloaded.\" It has also been featured in \"GeneRally and\" \"Top Gear\" (BBC) Series 16 Special Episode, \"East Coast Road Trip\". North Wilkesboro Speedway, along with other dirt tracks such as Occoneechee Speedway, is one of the inspirations for the Thomasville Speedway in the Pixar movie \"Cars 3\". North Wilkesboro Speedway was featured as the backdrop and story line on Travel Channel's Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern in the episode entitled North Carolina's Moonshine Highway.\n\n\n\n"}

Howard\n\nRowland Stuart Howard (24 October 1959 – 30 December 2009) was an Australian rock musician, guitarist and songwriter, best known for his work with the post-punk group The Birthday Party and his subsequent solo career.\n\nRowland Stuart Howard was born on 24 October 1959 in Melbourne, to John Stanton Howard and Lorraine (née Stuart) and the second of three children. His sister Angela and musician Harry Howard. In a 2016 interview, his brother Harry Howard stated the family is of paternal English descent from Bolton, Lancashire and maternal Scottish descent.\n\nRowland Stuart Howard wrote \"Shivers\" at the age of 16 while in the band The Young Charlatans. Howard gained acclaim after joining Melbourne-based band The Boys Next Door, when the song was released as a single. The band changed their name to The Birthday Party and Howard's discordant guitar remained a major factor in their sound. The Birthday Party relocated from Australia to London in 1980 and subsequently to West Berlin.\n\nThe Birthday Party's early records were released by Missing Link Records in Australia and 4AD Records in the UK. They later became associated with Mute Records in Europe. Howard and singer Nick Cave suffered 'creative differences', and Howard left the Birthday Party as they transformed into The Bad Seeds. He soon became a member of Crime & the City Solution, a band led by Simon Bonney. Later he formed These Immortal Souls with girlfriend Genevieve McGuckin, brother, Harry Howard, and Epic Soundtracks.\n\nHoward also collaborated with Lydia Lunch, Nikki Sudden, ex-Barracudas singer Jeremy Gluck, guitarist Gavin Poolman, French electro group KaS Product, Barry Adamson, Einstürzende Neubauten, guitarist Chris Haskett, The Gun Club singer and songwriter Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Fad Gadget, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Henry Rollins, and A.C. Marias.\n\nLydia Lunch and Thurston Moore recorded a version of Howard's song \"Still Burning\" for Lunch's \"In Limbo\" (1984). \"Still Burning\" had previously been recorded as a bass-heavy track with Howard on vocals, during the \"Honeymoon In Red\" recording sessions (1983–1987).\n\nThese Immortal Souls released their first album \"Get Lost, (Don't Lie!)\" in 1987 and played shows in Europe and America, returning to Australia for a short tour in 1988.\n\nAfter the release of These Immortal Souls' second album, \"I'm Never Gonna Die Again\", (1992) and another Howard/Lunch collaboration \"Shotgun Wedding\", Howard, Lunch and members of The Beasts Of Bourbon performed live on tour in Australia and Europe. \"Shotgun Wedding\" was re-released with a second compact disc of live recordings. \"Shotgun Wedding\" featured cover versions of \"In My Time of Dying\" and Alice Cooper's \"Black Juju\".\n\nHoward sang backing vocals on the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album \"Let Love In\" (1994). In 1995 These Immortal Souls contributed their version of \"You Can't Unring a Bell\" to a Tom Waits tribute album \"Step Right Up\".\n\nHe left London to return to Melbourne in 1995.\n\nPaul Godfrey a.k.a. Epic Soundtracks, the UK drummer for These Immortal Souls, was found dead in his London apartment on 5 November 1997. These Immortal Souls played their last show, at the Greyhound Hotel in St Kilda, with Lydia Lunch in 1998.\n\nHoward lamented in a 1999 television interview (\"Studio 22\", ABCTV) with Clinton Walker that people still asked him about \"Shivers\", a song he wrote when he was sixteen years old which first became well known when it was sung by Nick Cave.\n\nHoward released a solo album called \"Teenage Snuff Film\" in Australia in 1999.\n\nThe Birthday Party song \"Release the Bats\" was used in the true crime film \"Chopper\" (2000).\n\nAn unofficial Rowland S. Howard fan website was established as the amount of Rowland S. Howard related information and file swapping grew steadily on the internet from the mid-1990s.\n\nHoward made a cameo appearance in the 2002 vampire movie \"Queen of the Damned\" as a musician in a vampire club band.\n\nIn August 2005, Howard performed at the premiere party for Scott Crary's film Kill Your Idols in Melbourne, Australia, along with the band HTRK.\n\nFrench label Stagger Records released a double CD tribute album to Howard in 2007 featuring Mick Harvey, The Drones, The Holy Soul, Penny Ikinger, Loene Carmen, Nikki Sudden, Noah Taylor and many more.\n\nIn September 2007, Howard joined with Magic Dirt and Beasts of Bourbon for a tour of the east coast of Australia. Howard appeared at the All Tomorrows Parties rock festival in Australia in January 2009, curated by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He was backed by Mick Harvey on drums, and JP Shilo on bass. Howard's second solo album, \"Pop Crimes\", was released in October 2009 to acclaim from the musician Robert Forster. He appeared on the Magic Dirt EP \"White Boy\" playing guitar and supplying vocals on the track \"Summer High\".\n\nHoward suffered from chronic Hepatitis C virus and had been told in 2003, when he was 44, that his liver was stricken with end-stage cirrhosis. Doctors compared it to the liver of a 74-year-old alcoholic. In an October 2009 interview, Howard said that the forthcoming album he was working on (\"Pop Crimes\") was recorded quickly: \"I contracted liver disease a while back and I've basically got liver cancer, I'm waiting for a transplant, if I don't get it things might not go so well...so...\" . He died of hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to liver cirrhosis on 30 December 2009. Howard was 50 years old. His funeral was held at Sacred Heart Church, St Kilda, Melbourne on 7 January 2010.\n\nHis Birthday Party bandmates reflected upon his death: Nick Cave told WENN, \"This is very sad news. Rowland was Australia's most unique, gifted and uncompromising guitarist. He was also a good friend. He will be missed by many\". Mick Harvey remarked, \"Sometimes people are ready to go because they have been sick for a long time, but Rowland really wanted to live. Things were going well for him outside his health and he wanted to take advantage of that, and he was very disappointed that he wasn't well enough to do so\".\n\nIn October 2011, filmmaker Richard Lowenstein (\"Dogs in Space\") and Lynn-Maree Milburn (\"We're Living on Dogfood\" – documentary maker), released a 110-minute documentary film on the life of Rowland S. Howard titled \"Autoluminescent: Rowland S. Howard\" which had a limited release for cinema. On 24 April 2013, Port Phillip Council approved a proposal to name a St Kilda laneway Rowland S. Howard Lane to honour Howard's contribution to the St Kilda music scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentaries:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970281", "title": "Bevel", "text": "Bevel\n\nA bevelled edge (UK) or beveled edge (US) is an edge of a structure that is not perpendicular to the faces of the piece. The words bevel and chamfer overlap in usage; in general usage they are often interchanged, while in technical usage they may sometimes be differentiated as shown in the image at right. A bevel is typically used to soften the edge of a piece for the sake of safety, wear resistance, or aesthetics; or to facilitate mating with another piece.\n\nMost cutting tools have a bevelled edge which is apparent when one examines the grind.\n\nBevel angles can be duplicated using a sliding T bevel.\n\nTypographic bevels are shading and artificial shadows that emulate the appearance of a 3-dimensional letter. The bevel is a relatively common effect in graphic editors such as Photoshop. As such, it is in widespread use in mainstream logos and other design elements.\n\nBevelled edges are a common aesthetic nicety added to window panes and mirrors.\n\nGeologists refer to any slope of land into a stratum of different elevation as a bevel.\n\nIn waterskiing, a bevel is the transition area between the side of the ski and the bottom of the ski. Beginners tend to prefer sharp bevels, which allow the ski to glide on the water surface.\n\nIn Disc Golf, the 'beveled edge' was patented in 1983 by Dave Dunipace who founded Innova Champion Discs. This element transformed the Frisbee into the farther flying golf discs the sport uses today.\n\nWith a deck of cards, the top portion can be slid back so that the back of the deck is at an angle, a technique used in card tricks.\n\nIn the semiconductor industry, wafers have two typical edge types: a slanted beveled shape or a rounded bullet shape. The edges on the beveled types are called the bevel region, and they are typically ground at a 22 degree angle.\n\nBeveling and chamfering (along with other profiles) are applied to thicker pieces of metal prior to welding, see Welding_joint#V-joints. The bevel provides a smooth clean edge to the plate or pipe and allows a weld of the correct shape (to prevent center-line cracking) to join the separate pieces of metal. \n\nSimple bevels can be used with a backup strip (thin removable sheet behind the plate joint) with chamfers (and a small land) being used on open root welds. Particularly thick plate will have a \"J\" shaped chamfer or \"U\" shaped groove to reduce the amount of welding filler metal used.\n\nCruciform joint preparation can involve a double bevel to permit full penetration of each weld to the other, removing a possible void space in the center.\n\n"}

The Law Center is part of Touro College and University System, a private, not-for-profit, coeducational institution based in New York City.\n\nTouro Law Center has 36 full-time faculty members and 58 teaching adjunct faculty. Of the Touro graduates who took the New York bar for the first time in July 2019, 63.4% passed, vs. a statewide average of 86% for ABA-approved law schools.\n\nTouro Law Center is the only law school in Suffolk County, New York. After briefly beginning operations in Manhattan, the Law Center's first campus was established in the town of Huntington, which is located in northwestern Suffolk County. In 2007, the Law Center moved to its current campus in Central Islip. The Central Islip campus, consisting of a four-story, 180,000-square-foot building, is located within walking distance of both The Alfonse M. D’Amato United States Courthouse and the John P. Cohalan State Court Complex, in which the Suffolk County District and Family Courts and the New York State Supreme Court sit.\n\nStudents may enroll in either a program to earn a Juris Doctor (JD) degree or a Master of Laws (LLM) degree. Both full-time and part-time programs are available to students in the JD program.\n\nTouro Law Center is one of several law schools in New York State to offer a two-year accelerated JD program, in which accepted students fulfill their credit-requirements of study within 24 months, beginning with the summer of their first year, and sit for a Bar Examination 26 months after they begin their law school studies. In addition, Touro Law Center offers an accelerated JD program, referred to as a \"three-plus-three\" (BA/JD) program, with the University of Central Florida, and an accelerated JD Program which allows graduates of foreign law schools to earn a J.D. degree in two years.\n\nTouro Law Center offers four concentrations for J.D. candidates, an L.L.M program for U.S. law school graduates and a Master of Laws in U.S. Legal Studies for foreign law graduates, and joint J.D./M.B.A, J.D./M.P.A., and J.D./M.S.W. programs with Touro College, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and LIU-Post.\n\nTouro Law Center has at times offered summer programs in Vietnam, Germany, Croatia, China, and Israel. Only the Vietnam program was offered for the summer of 2018. In 2011, when the Vietnam program was first offered, Touro Law Center was the only law school to offer such a program within the borders of Vietnam.\n\nIn September 2013, Touro Law Center joined the Educating Tomorrow's Lawyers Consortium, which consisted of 31 ABA-accredited law schools that have demonstrated a commitment to innovation in legal education and offer a number of law school courses \"that implement a student-centered approach to legal education\". The consortium was dissolved in 2017. In 2013, PreLaw Magazine recognized Touro Law Center as one of six law school schools in the nation offering innovative clinical and experiential learning opportunities, highlighting the law school's ProBono Uncontested Divorce Project. Touro Law Center is also a member of the Alliance for Experiential Learning in Law, an alliance that currently has 113 law school and legal service organization members, which was established in 2011 with the goal of integrating experience-based education into the traditional law school curriculum.\n\nIn Fall 2006, the Law Center began a pilot program that required all first year students to observe courtroom practice in both the federal Alfonse M. D’Amato United States Courthouse and the John P. Cohalan State Court Complex. In 2009, the Center for Court Innovation issued a report on its three-year study of the pilot program; the report concluded that consideration should be given to expanding the program either through increased observation opportunities or participation of students beyond their first year of law school. As of 2011, the program is a graduation requirement in which all first year students must participate, and upper-level students have the option of continuing the curriculum through coursework and court externships, clerkships, or pro bono projects.\n\nTouro Law Center's clinical program consists of legal clinics that specialize in the areas of:\n\nTouro Law Center also hosts the following Institutes and Centers:\n\nThe International Justice Center for Post–Graduate Development serves as a national clearinghouse for the law-school based incubator movement. Led by Fred Rooney, the Center launched Touro's Community Justice Center in 2013, housing eight-ten start-up law firms owned by Touro alumni.\n\nThe William Randolph Hearst William Randolph Hearst Public Advocacy Center (PAC), established in 2007, has 14 offices and houses on-campus non-profit legal service providers such as the Nassau/Suffolk Law Services Committee, Inc. (grant recipient of the Legal Services Corporation), New York Civil Liberties Union, and the Empire Justice Center (member of the Consumer Federation of America); there are also additional off-campus member affiliates. Thomas Maligno has served as the Executive Director of the Public Advocacy Center since it opened.\n\nTouro Law Center was established and admitted its first class in the Fall of 1980. The first class graduated in Spring 1983, and in that same year, the Law Center was provisionally accredited by the American Bar Association. It began operations in a building located at 30 West 44th Street in Manhattan, New York City, which is now the home of the Penn Club of New York. In 1982, the law school moved to the town of Huntington in Suffolk County, New York and the building it occupied for twenty years, formerly Toaz Junior High School. At the time of its move to Huntington, Touro Law Center was the only law school on Long Island to offer a part-time program to students. In April 1986, the Law Center was officially named the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center, in honor of Judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg, who served as an associate judge of the New York State Court of Appeals from 1975 to 1983. Judge Fuchsberg began serving on the Board of Trustees of Touro College at the time it was established in the 1970s, and during his tenure on the Board, he advocated for the establishment, accreditation, and growth of the Law Center. The Law Center achieved full accreditation by the American Bar Association in 1989.\n\nJohn S. Bainbridge was the dean of the law school from 1982 to 1985. During his tenure, Bainbridge recruited the founding faculty and administrators and guided the school through the first American Bar Association inspection that led to its provisional national accreditation. Howard A. Glickstein served as the dean of the Law Center from 1986 to 2004. During Glickstein's tenure, the Law Center was accepted as a member of the American Association of Law Schools, which occurred in 1994. During his eighteen-year tenure, Glickstein also oversaw the initial plans for the Central Islip, New York campus and the development of the construction project. Construction on the new campus began in March 2005, shortly after Glickstein's tenure ended. From 2004 to 2012, Lawrence Raful served as dean. During Raful's tenure, the construction of the Central Islip campus took place, opening in 2007. In 2012, Patricia Salkin was appointed the dean of the law school. She served until 2016, when she was promoted to the position of provost of graduate and professional studies for the Touro College and University system. Harry Ballan, senior counsel at Davis Polk & Wardwell, LLP was subsequently appointed to the position. In June 2019, Elena B. Langan was announced as the new dean of the law school, having previously served as dean of Concordia Law School and interim dean of Nova Southeastern University's Shepard Broad College of Law.<ref>\n"}
{"id": "1970288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970288", "title": "Shade avoidance", "text": "Shade avoidance\n\nShade avoidance is a set of responses that plants display when they are subjected to the shade of another plant. It often includes elongation, altered flowering time, increased apical dominance and altered partitioning of resources. This set of responses is collectively called the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS).\n\nShade responses display varying strength along a continuum. Most plants are neither extreme shade avoiders or tolerators, but possess a combination of the two strategies; this helps adapt them to their environment. However, the ability to perceive and respond to shade plays a very important role in all plants: they are sessile by nature and access to photosynthetically active radiation is essential for plant nutrition and growth. In addition, the time at which a plant starts to flower is affected by the amount of light that is available.\n\nOver the past few decades, major increases in grain yield have come largely through increasing planting densities. As planting densities increase so does the proportion of far red light in the canopy. Thus, it is likely that plant breeders have selected for lines with reduced SAS in their efforts to produce high yields at high density.\n\nPlants can tell the difference between the shade of an inanimate object (e.g. a rock) and the shade of another plant, as well as the presence of nearby plants that may compete with and shade it in the future. In the shade of a plant, far red light is present in a higher irradiance than red light, as a result of the absorption of the red light by the pigments involved in photosynthesis, while a nearby plant forms an intermediate ratio. This is known as far red enrichment. Phytochrome can be used to measure the ratio of far red to red light, and thus to detect whether the plant is in the shade of another plant, so it can alter its growth strategy accordingly (photomorphogenesis). In Arabidopsis, phytochrome B is the predominant photoreceptor that regulates SAS. Phytochromes exist in two forms: P and P. It is synthesised as P, but red light triggers a conformational change, producing P. Far red light causes the phytochrome to be converted back into P. For a given red:far red light ratio, there will be a dynamic equilibrium in the relative quantities of P and P present. Far red enrichment causes a build-up of P. If P is present above a species-specific threshold, shade avoidance signal transduction pathways will be activated.\n\nSeedling response is the most well understood factor of shade avoidance. In the model organism \"Arabidopsis thaliana\", the shade avoidance response varies at different points in the life cycle. Dry, dormant seeds will not germinate if they are in the shade. Once dormancy has been broken and they have imbibed water, the seeds are committed to germination. Water-imbibed seeds display hypocotyl elongation; if the shade were caused by excessive soil depth, this would help the seedling grow vertically very quickly and push up and out of the ground. If an \"Arabidopsis\" seedling becomes shaded, its petioles and internodes elongate. It may even lose rosette morphology.\n\nStudies using \"Brassica rapa\" indicate that the light quality and ratio available to seedlings is sensed in the cotyledons, which upregulates the production of auxin. \"Arabidopsis\" was used to demonstrate PIF (Phytochrome Interacting Factor) involvement in auxin production. PIFs are transcription factors that regulate thousands of genes related to germination repression and shade avoidance, and PIF4, PIF5, and PIF7 directly regulate genes that code for the enzymes required in auxin synthesis. Other PIF proteins are thought to be involved in regulating auxin and the plant's response. In shade conditions, P induces the dephosphorylation of PIF proteins, which strengthens their ability to bind DNA and promote transcription of genes involved in shade avoidance response, including in the production of auxin and its receptors. Auxin is transported to the hypocotyl to promote elongation, although the mechanism it uses to do so remains unclear.\n\nShade avoidance response in adult plants is less commonly studied than it is in seedlings, though adult \"Arabidopsis\" show more complex response patterns than seedlings. Shaded adults have elongated petioles at the rosette, smaller leaf blades, and suppressed axillary bud growth. By elongating the petiole sideways, the plant repositions its leaves away from shading plants to absorb more red light, though there is a trade off in leaf size. The leaves can also bend upwards towards potential light sources as a result of higher growth on the underside of the petiole than the top, a process called hyponasty. Flattening of leaves in plants with normally curled leaves also increases surface area for light absorption.\n\nIf a mature plant becomes shaded, shade avoidance also often prompts changes in reproductive strategies. Plants may flower early, as it is unlikely that growing more structures will result in profitable nutrient gain in the short term. In \"Arabidopsis\", early flowering is linked to overall lower reproductive success due to lower seed production, smaller fruit, and lower germination rate of seeds, although germination success is also dependent on genetic variation between individuals.\n\nLike seedlings, adult plant shade avoidance involves several mechanisms acting together. Petiole elongation is both a result of cell expansion and cell division, though not at the same stage in petiole and leaf formation. In newly growing leaves, cell division is the primary factor, while fully formed leaves and petioles rely on cell expansion. Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a family of cell wall modifying proteins. In shade conditions, the genes coding for XTH9, XTH15/XTR7, XTH16, XTH17, and XTH19 are up-regulated and these proteins act to hydrolyze and weaken the cell wall, allowing for expansion of the petiole cells.\nLike in seedlings, PIF7 is involved in the regulation of petiole and leaf growth due to low R:FR, by up-regulating auxin-related and brassinosteroid-response genes which promote growth. Auxin signalling is also essential to hyponasty, though its role is not yet fully understood.\nLeaf curling is primarily a response to phytochrome B converting to P in shade conditions, which promotes unequal proliferation and growth of cells on the upper and lower leaf sides. Two redundant genes, \"ATHB4\" and \"HAT3\", code for transcription factors that regulate leaf curling, with loss of function mutants having plants with leaves that curl downwards, and plants with over-expressive copies of these genes having leaves that curl strongly upwards. By changing expression of these genes, plants can straighten their leaves in response to shade.\n"}

{"id": "1970304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970304", "title": "Charmbracelet", "text": "Charmbracelet\n\nCharmbracelet is the ninth studio album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, released on December 3, 2002, through MonarC Entertainment and Island Records. The album was her first release since her breakdown following the release of her film \"Glitter\" (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack album. Critics described \"Charmbracelet\" as one of her most personal records, following 1997's \"Butterfly\". Throughout the project, Carey collaborated with several musicians, including Jermaine Dupri, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, 7 Aurelius and Dre & Vidal.\n\nAccording to Carey, love is the album's main theme, and the songs combine introspective and personal themes with celebration and fun. The album contains a mixture of R&B beats, and the songs incorporate elements of other genres, such as gospel and soul. Compared to \"Glitter\", which featured a variety of sampled melodies from the 1980s, \"Charmbracelet\" has a softer hip hop and R&B sound to it. Cam'ron, Jay-Z and Freeway also appear on the album.\n\n\"Charmbracelet\" debuted at number three on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and sold 241,000 copies in its first week. The album peaked within the top 40 in seven countries, including top ten positions in Japan and Switzerland, and sold an estimated three million copies worldwide. Three singles were released to promote the album. The lead single, \"Through the Rain\" reached the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy and the United Kingdom. In the US, it topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart, but stalled at number 81 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Carey embarked on the , and performed 69 shows in over eight months. She also performed on televised shows such as the 30th annual American Music Awards, \"Today\" and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nBefore the release of \"Charmbracelet\", Carey experienced a year of critical, commercial and personal struggles, following the poor reception of her debut film \"Glitter\" (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack, as well as her subsequent hospitalization. After divorcing her husband, Tommy Mottola, Carey released \"Butterfly\" (1997). With her next release, \"Rainbow\" (1999), Carey incorporated elements of R&B and hip hop into her music, particularly on the lead single \"Heartbreaker\". According to \"The Sacramento Bee\", she attempted to sound more \"ghetto\". She stopped working with longtime pop producers such as Babyface and Walter Afanasieff, in order to pursue a new sound and audience, and worked with writers Sean Combs and Jermaine Dupri. Following the worldwide success of \"Rainbow\", Carey left Columbia Records. Controversially, Mottola and executive Benny Medina in 1999 used several songs Carey had written and co-written for Jennifer Lopez. Carey's 2001 film debut \"Glitter\" was panned by movie critics, and earned less than eight million dollars at the box office.\n\nCarey's $100 million recording contract was bought out by Virgin Records for $28 million. Carey checked into a hospital in Connecticut, following a controversial appearance on \"Total Request Live\", in which she gave ice cream to fans, left troubling messages on her website and demonstrated what was considered by the media as \"erratic behavior\". Carey said she had an \"emotional and physical breakdown.\" After a fortnight's hospitalization, Carey flew to Capri, Italy, where she stayed for five months and began writing and producing material for a new studio album about her recent troubles. She was signed by Island Records, and started her own imprint, MonarC Entertainment, for her intended \"comeback\" release, \"Charmbracelet\".\n\nCarey started writing songs for the album in early 2002, before she signed the record deal. She decided to rest, traveled to Capri and moved into a recording studio where she could focus on writing and recording without distractions. Most of the album was recorded in Capri, although she traveled to Atlanta, New York and Philadelphia to record some tracks. That year, Carey claimed \"Charmbracelet\" to be the \"most personal album\" she had ever made. She worked with longtime collaborators Jermaine Dupri, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Randy Jackson and other songwriters and producers 7 Aurelius, Just Blaze, Damizza and Dre & Vidal. The opening track and the first track to be written for the album, \"Through the Rain\", was written by Carey and Lionel Cole, was inspired Carey's recent experiences, and was co-produced by Jam and Lewis. It was released as the lead single from the album.\n\nJam, Lewis and Carey also worked \"Yours\", which Jam said contains \"probably one of the best hooks [ever]\", and likened it to one of trio's previous collaborations, \"Thank God I Found You\" (2000). Initially, the song was recorded as duet with pop singer Justin Timberlake. However, due to contractual complications, it was never released and a solo version was featured on the album. Jam and Lewis produced two more songs, \"Wedding Song\" and \"Satisfy\"the latter featuring background vocals from Michael Jacksonwhich were not released on the album.\n\nCarey decided to work with Just Blaze after she heard the song \"Oh Boy\", which he produced for Cam'ron. Just Blaze and Carey produced \"Boy (I Need You)\", a remake of \"Oh Boy\", and \"You Got Me\". Carey said \"Boy (I Need You)\" was one of her favorites on the album. \"You Got Me\" features rap verses from Jay-Z and Freeway, was noted by Carey as a \"signature Just Blaze track\". Jay-Z was in Capri on vacation, and went to the studio to hear the song and said that he wanted to contribute to it and added rap verses of his own. Dupri produced \"The One\" and \"You Had Your Chance\". He said that they wanted to stick to the \"same familiar sound\" from his previous collaborations with Carey. Carey said \"The One\" was a personal song, which was about being hurt in past relationships and the uncertainty about forming new ones. Carey decided to experiment with a live band for the album. In April 2002, she met 7 Aurelius and asked him to produce songs for the album. They flew to Nassau, Bahamas and recorded a mixture of mid-tempo and up-tempo tracks and ballads with a live band. 7 Aurelius said that Carey was \"an amazing writer\" and described the process of recording:\nWe did three or four songs in three or four days. The way we was doing it, I had [a horn section] down there along with me. We had the whole room set up with candles, some nice wine[it was] a very good vibe. It was completely stripped down, like 'Mariah Carey Unplugged'. She stripped herself down to her talent. She was really trusting of me and my vision, and I was trusting of who she was.\n\nRandy Jackson contributed to four tracks on the album, and said it was \"the most real and honest record she's made. She didn't care what anyone thought of the lyrics. They were only important to her.\" Carey included a cover of Def Leppard's song \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\". During the photo shoot for \"Charmbracelet\" at Capri, Carey happened to listen to Def Leppard's greatest hits album \"\" (1995), which contains the song, and decided to cover it. In an interview with \"Billboard\", Carey said that the song is \"an example of her musical diversity\". Jackson also worked on \"My Saving Grace\", which Carey said describes her thoughts about the writing, recording and mastering process. While working in Capri, Carey's father became ill with cancer and she returned to New York to spend some time with him; he died soon after. In his memory, Carey wrote and produced the song \"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy\". Carey said that the song represents \"his side of the family and is kind of hard to talk about.\" The song proved to be \"very emotional\" for Carey, and she sang it only once in the studio. DJ Quik also produced songs for the album, but none of them were included.\n\nCarey attempted to make a musical comeback with \"Charmbracelet\", which focused on bringing Carey back to her R&B and soul roots in an attempt to recapture her audience. Critics both praised and criticized the condition of Carey's voice on the album; many called the songs average, and felt that most lacked sufficient hooks. The album's lead single, and Carey's boldest attempt at recreating the ballads from the early years of her career, was \"Through the Rain\", which was produced by Carey, and was described by one critic as \"the sort of self-help ballad Ms. Carey was singing a decade ago\". The songs on the album are a mixture of several genres.\n\nCarey's cover of \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\", was recorded using live instrumentation, and was the album's third single. It begins as a \"piano-driven slow jam\", which is followed by a \"dramatic chord progression\" after the second chorus, and Carey's \"precise and fluttery voice reaches incredible heights\" as it \"turns the power ballad into something more delicate.\" Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called \"Yours\"\"a delectable combination of breathy vocals and playful rhythms.\" Barry Walters from \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that on \"Yours\", \"Carey's lead vocals blend into choruses of overdubbed Mariah's cooing overlapping phrases. Circling these are choirs of more Mariahs singing harmonies and countermelodies. Topping it off are generous sprinklings of the singer's patented birdcalls, wails, sighs and whispers.\"\n\nCritics considered \"Subtle Invitation\" to be one of the album's strongest songs because of its \"well executed\" jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from \"The Boston Herald\" described it as fascinating and wrote, \"it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice.\" \"Clown\" drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said \"Clown\" was \"languidly sinister\", with lyrics such as, \"I should've left it at 'I like your music too' ... You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other.\" Critics compared \"I Only Wanted\" with \"My All\"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, \"Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil\". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.\n\n\"Sunflowers for Alfred Roy\", one of the album's most personal songs, is named after Carey's father; she makes direct reference to him and a moment they shared at his death bed. The song is backed with a simple piano accompaniment, and Carey recounts a visit with her father in his hospital room: \"Strange to feel that proud, strong man / Grip tightly to my hand.\"\n\nFour singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"Through the Rain\" was released on September 24, 2002. It received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom said it was too similar to her earlier ballads, such as \"Hero\" and \"Outside\", while others praised Carey's vocals in the song. It was one of Carey's poorest-selling US singles, reaching number 81 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. However, it topped the Hot Dance Club Play charts and reached the top twenty of the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside the US, the single performed moderately, peaking within the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy and the UK, and within the top 20 in Ireland, Australia, Norway and Denmark. The music video of \"Through the Rain\", directed by Daver Meyers, is based on the courtship and eloping of Carey's parents. Scenes of Carey singing in a street when rain starts to fall are juxtaposed with the story of a mixed-race couple who run away from their families, who oppose their relationship.\n\n\"Boy (I Need You)\", which was released as the second single on November 26, 2002, received mixed reviews from critics. The single failed to make much impact on charts worldwide; it reached number 68 on the US \"Billboard\" Hip-Hop/R&B Songs chart and number 57 on the US Hot Singles Sales chart. Elsewhere, the song reached number 17 in the UK, and peaked within the top 40 in Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand. The music video for \"Boy (I Need You)\" was directed by Joseph Kahn and was filmed at Shibuya and Los Angeles. Initially, \"The One\" was scheduled to be released as the second single and the music video was shot for that song. However, halfway through the filming, the single was changed to \"Boy (I Need You)\". Described as \"Speed Racer meets Hello Kitty meets me and Cam'ron\" by Carey, the video incorporates elements of Japanese culture and features Carey's alter-ego Bianca.\n\nThe third single from the album was Carey's cover version of \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\", released on November 25, 2003. Though it gained mostly positive reviews, it failed to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but reached number five on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Outside the US, the song saw its highest peak in Switzerland, reaching number 28 and staying on the charts for eight weeks. It also charted in Austria and the Wallonia region of Belgium. The music video for the song was directed by Sanaa Hamri. Another cut from the album, \"Irresistible (Westside Connection)\" charted at number 81 on the US \"Billboard\" Hip-Hop/R&B Songs.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Through the Rain\", Carey embarked on several US and international promotional tours in support of \"Charmbracelet\" and its accompanying singles. Promotion for \"Through the Rain\" began at the 2002 NRJ Awards, where Carey performed wearing a long black skirt and denim blazer. Three days before the album's US release, a one-hour program titled \"Mariah Carey: Shining Through the Rain\", in which Carey was interviewed and sang several songs from \"Charmbracelet\" and her back catalog, aired on MTV. Carey addressed rumors of her breakdown and its cause, and spoke about the album and its inspiration, and conducted a question and answer session with fans. During the first month after the album's release, Carey appeared on several television talk shows. She launched her promotional tour on \"Today\", where she performed four songs at Mall of America for a crowd of over 10,000. On December 2, Carey traveled to Brazil for South American promotion of \"Charmbracelet\", appearing on the popular television program \"Fantástico\". She sang \"My All\", and performed \"Through the Rain\" and \"I Only Wanted\" wearing a long pink gown. She also made a surprise appearance on \"Show da Virada\", singing \"Through the Rain\" and \"My All\", while wearing a short silver dress. On December 3, 2002, Carey appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", where she performed \"Through the Rain\" and \"My Saving Grace\", and gave a highly publicized interview about her hospitalization. Before her breakdown, Carey had been booked for a private interview with ABC's Barbara Walters, executive producer of \"The View\", following \"Glitter\"s release. Instead of giving Walters the full-coverage interview following Carey's return to the public eye, Island decided \"Oprah\" was more appropriate, and changed the appearance. Carey's interview with Matt Lauer on \"Dateline NBC\" aired the same evening.\n\nOn December 17, Carey performed \"I Only Wanted\" on \"The View\" after guest co-hosting the program. One month later, Carey was one of the headlining performers at the 30th annual American Music Awards, held on January 13, 2003. She performed \"Through the Rain\" alongside a live gospel choir, and wore a long black evening gown. During the performance, images of newspaper headlines reporting Carey's breakdown were projected on a large curtain behind her, with one reading, \"When you fall down, you get back up.\" Carey received a standing ovation. In mid-February, Carey was the headline performer at the NBA all-star game, which was Michael Jordan's last game. She wore a long, purple, skin-tight Washington Wizards' dress, and performed \"Boy (I Need You)\", \"My Saving Grace\" and \"Hero\", which received a standing ovation and brought Jordan to tears. On March 1, 2003, Carey performed at the Soul Train Music Awards, sporting a retro-curled hairstyle and wearing a burgundy evening gown. She performed \"My Saving Grace\", and as at the American Music Awards, images of newspaper headlines and inspirational photographs were projected onto a large screen. Following the performance, Carey was awarded a lifetime achievement award for her contribution to music. Towards the end of March, \"Charmbracelet\" was released in Europe and Carey appeared on several television programs to promotion the album. She performed the album's leading two singles on the British music chart show, \"Top of the Pops\", and a similar set on \"The Graham Norton Show\" and \"Fame Academy\". On the latter program, Carey was joined on stage by the show's finalists, who sang the climax on \"Through the Rain\" alongside her.\n\nTo promote the album, Carey announced a world tour in April 2003. , \"\" was her most extensive tour, lasting over eight months and performing sixty-nine shows in venues worldwide. Before tickets went on sale in the US, venues were switched from large arenas to smaller, more intimate theater shows. According to Carey, the change was made in order to give fans a more intimate show, and something more Broadway-influenced. She said, \"It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me.\" However, while smaller productions were booked for the US leg of the tour, Carey performed at stadia and arenas in Asia and Europe, and performed for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China. In the UK, it was Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London; she performed in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.\n\n\"Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey\" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and audiences, many of whom complimented the quality of Carey's live vocals and the production of the shows. Fans were given the opportunity to request songs from Carey's catalog, which added to its positive reception. At her concert in Manila, Rito P. Asilo from \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" wrote, \"I didn't expect her voice to be that crystal clear!\" He added, \"After 15 songs, we couldn't seem to get enough of Mariahand we became a believer!\".\n\nUpon its release, \"Charmbracelet\" was released to mixed critical reception. Aggregator website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score, gave \"Charmbracelet\" a score of 43/100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated the album two out of five stars, and criticized its production and the condition of Carey's voice. He wrote, \"Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record ... Her voice is damaged, and there's not a moment where it sounds strong or inviting.\" Tom Sinclair of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said she was \"in fine voice\". He wrote that \"Through the Rain\" sinks in its own sodden sentimentality, as do by-the-numbers efforts like 'Yours' and 'I Only Wanted'\", and added that \"Clown' is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal, while 'Sunflowers for Alfred Roy' is a short, sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment\". He finished by saying that \"too much of \"Charmbracelet\" is mired in middle-of-the-road muck.\"\n\n\"Billboard\" editor Michael Paoletta praised Carey's return to her core audience. He said that although Carey might have alienated her hip hop followers from her previous three albums, her older fans from the 1990s would be more receptive to the material and her new image. Kelefa Sanneh from \"The New York Times\" wrote that the album \"is generally pleasant, although it's not always exciting, and a few of the collaborations go awry\". He called Carey's voice \"invariably astonishing\", and said that \"she can hit high notes that barely sound human\", praised her versatility, and wrote that she \"also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine.\" Ethan Browne of \"New York\" slated the album's whimsical chimes and tinkling keyboards, and wrote, \"Was \"Charmbracelet\" recorded in a Casio shop? This instrument needs to be stopped.\"\n\nRating \"Charmbracelet\" two out of five stars, Barry Walters from \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that none of the songs were bold, that the lack of hooks made the album weak, and said, \"Carey needs bold songs that help her use the power and range for which she is famous. \"Charmbracelet\" is like a stream of watercolors that bleed into a puddle of brown.\" Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented Carey's mixture of pop and hip hop melodies, and wrote, \"Though there's nothing as immediate as 'Fantasy' or 'My All' here, Charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than 1999's \"Rainbow\" and almost as creatively liberating as \"Butterfly\". British columnist Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK called the songs on \"Charmbracelet\" forgettable, and wrote, \"She used to take risks, but \"Charmbracelet\" is conservative, unadventurous and uninspiring; and, while it's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts, it's impossible to admire Mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit.\" John Mulvey from \"NME\" criticized its content, writing, \"Nominally, \"Charmbracelet\" is R&B, much like Tony Blair is nominally a socialist ... Tragedies, all told, have been worse\"\n\nAt the 17th Japan Gold Disc Award in 2003, the album was nominated in the category of Rock and Pop Album of the Year (International).\n\n\"Charmbracelet\" was initially slated for release in the US on December 10, 2002.

Nintendo Switch version was released in 2018.\n\nA bonus scoring system was added that allows the player to be rewarded depending on how many enemies are killed in the time allotted. The time allotted is determined from the type of emblem that is picked up. A time meter will appear on the top of the screen, and if the player lives through the end of the level, they will be awarded bonus points for badges that represent feats accomplished.

With Tarma Roving and Eri Kasamoto unable to help out due to their own assignments in the matter, Marco Rossi and Fiolina Germi are called in to investigate the situation and are joined by two newcomers, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey. In their investigation, the group discovers that a rich terrorist organization known as the Amadeus Syndicate is behind the nefarious plot and has allied with General Morden's Rebel Army. They head into battle against Amadeus' forces, hoping to destroy the cyber virus before it gets the chance to wipe out the entire world's military computer system.\n\nHalfway through the game's story mode, the player is confronted by who they presume to be General Morden. However in the final stage, they find an underground facility where android doubles of Morden are being manufactured. Allen O' Neil (who has appeared numerous times throughout the series) fights the player in this stage for the very last time and is also revealed to be a machine replica. Finally, the player confronts the leader of the syndicate, Dr. Amadeus himself, who attacks with a series of powerful robots, but he is defeated and is trapped in his own devices as the base self-destructs, presumably killing him. If the player safely escapes the base's bonus explosion stage, the credits will show the main cast eating a feast of food, but if the player gets caught in the explosion, the player character(s) will appear in the hospital, bandaged and bed-ridden, being brought get-well gifts of food from both Tarma and Eri. After the credits, a single computer monitor is seen transmitting data to an unknown location before shutting down.\n\n\n\n\"Metal Slug 4\" was mixed to positive received by players with users scores of 7.8 for PS2, 7.3 for Xbox, 8.1 for Neo Geo and 8.3 for the arcade versions.

Five residents of an Ohio prison, which included two adherents of Asatru, a minister of the white supremacist Church of Jesus Christ Christian, a Wiccan and a Satanist filed suit. The men stated in federal district court that prison officials violated RLUIPA by failing to accommodate the inmates' exercise of their \"nonmainstream\" religions.

Havertown's ZIP Code is 19083 and \"Havertown\" is a postal address. The name \"Havertown\" does not appear until the advent of the ZIP Code in the early 1960s. Prior to the ZIP Code's introduction, each constituent community was known by its local name: Bon Air, Brookline, Penfield, Beechwood, Llanerch, Manoa, Oakmont, Coopertown, Ardmore. Under William Penn's land divisions these communities were part of the Welsh Tract and comprised the area known as Harford, a Welsh contraction of Haverford.\n\nHaverford Township was founded by Welsh Quakers in 1681 on land purchased from William Penn. The settlers named their new home after Haverfordwest, Wales, UK. The township is home to many historic sites. The Grange Estate, entertained the Revolutionary War figures George Washington and General Lafayette. Nitre Hall, along Karakung (Cobb's) Creek, supplied the United States with over 800,000 pounds of gunpowder during the War of 1812. Leedom Hall was the probable home to William Howell the founder of Haverford Mills which date from 1688. Other Havertown sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Federal School and Lawrence Cabin. Coopertown, appears as early as 1848 as the first community and the earliest post office is found at the Spread Eagle Tavern at the junction of the present Eagle and Manoa Roads. Historic Roads\n\nThe Haverford Road is one of the earliest roads laid out by civil ordinance. Dates for its layout and completion vary from 1687 to 1703. Darby Road, known earlier as Coopertown Road dates from 1687. Records show its extension to Radnor the “principal market for corn,” ordered in 1696. Mill Road, at one time called Dickinson Mill Road, may be one of the earliest roads of popular use. Its zig-zag pattern illustrates the indirect path required by horse and cart going up or down hill. Eagle Road which takes its present name from the Spread Eagle Tavern c.1814 led Quaker settlers to the Haverford Meeting House\n\nThe Railroads and Planned Communities\nPrior to the First World War Haverford was a township of extensive farms. Property maps in 1862 indicate that the landowners were descendants of the same families that arrived with William Penn: among them, the Lawrences, the Ellis’, the Humphreys and the Lewis’. In 1895 The Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company begins service between 69th Street and West Chester with a major junction at Llanerch. By 1902 the maps indicate a significant change in land ownership. Most of the old family names no longer appear. In that same year on May 29, the trolley line opened the branch from Llanerch to Ardmore. Llanerch first appears as a small community with numbered streets. Darby Road is called Coopertown Road. A commercial rail line, now removed, served Boyle Fuel, Lobb Lumber and the Swell Bubble Gum factory up until the 1960s. (See Map)\n\nLlanerch\n\nLlanerch situated at the intersection of West Chester Pike and Darby Road was the first planned community of Haverford Township. Like many other suburban communities Llanerch was the child of the railroad companies. The railroad built houses for commuters and the commuters bought tickets for the rail lines. In 1897 the community was composed of twelve houses and Saint Andrew's Church. These houses and the church were designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Allison Hayes (1866–1930).https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/22160 Llanerch's first school followed in 1905. The present school structure, no longer functioning as a school, dates from 1913.\n\nBrookline\n\nBrookline, while not the first planned community, was the most fully executed. The Mueller Atlas of Delaware County, 1909, shows the initial layout for Brookline. At that time Darby Road between Eagle Road and Llanerch was called Haverford Road. Some construction began around that year, but it was not until after the First World War that the Manor Real Estate Company, a subsidiary of the railroads set out a plan for a housing development that offered every service, amenity and community need: “Brookline Manor.” (See Map) As in the 1909 plan we find an arrangement of regular streets divided by a broad “Boulevard.” The Boulevard intersected at a “T” juncture with the major township thoroughfare, Darby Road. The “Boulevard” would be home to commercial, religious and educational services. At the upper end of the “Boulevard” mercantile stores provided shoe makers, tap rooms, florists, bakery, barbers, a Five and Ten, the Quaker Store, the A&P grocery store and the \"Boulevard\" movie theater. (See Image) Along the length of the Boulevard the community found their religious houses of worship: The Methodist Church, Saint Faith Episcopal Church, The Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Temple Lutheran. On Earlington Road, to the side of the Boulevard's far end The Brookline School (1913) met educational needs.\n\nReturning to the intersection of the Boulevard with Darby Road we follow Darby Road west. Just beyond the intersection we find the Brookline Fire Company (1916). The Brookline Library (1938) and the Haverford High School (1923) are on Darby Road just beyond the Brookline Fire Company. In the early days the Brookline County Club and the Brookline airport were situated just behind Haverford High School. (See Image) Returning to the intersection of Brookline Boulevard and Darby Road at the corner of Manoa Road were the Police Station on the west side and Shearer's greenhouse and nursery on the east side.\n\nThe railroad company attended to their needs to sell tickets as well as to that of Brookline Manor for transportation. The Red Arrow Trolley line #103 ran from Ardmore down Darby Road then on to West Chester Pike to 69th and Market Streets, thus offering commuters quick access to the city. (See Image) The tracks which divided Darby Road were lined with fences of early blooming red roses. A bus line ran from Ardmore to 69th and Market by way of Brookline Boulevard and Earlington Road. The junction of the two lines was at the intersection of Darby Road and Brookline Boulevard. At the far end of Brookline Boulevard commuters found the services of the P&W, The Philadelphia and Western high-speed line. An electric train system that even today is one of the most rapid. With trolley lines at one end, the P&W at the other and a bus that ran between the two transportation to Philadelphia could not have been more convenient. The electric trolley lines were shortsightedly dismantled in 1966 in favor of gasoline operated buses.\n\nThe Irish in Havertown\n\nThe arrival of the Irish in Haverford Township occurs in three phases: the 19th century mill era, the early 20th century railroad communities and the post World War II suburban housing tracts. Born in Ireland in 1779, Dennis Kelly arrived in Philadelphia in 1806. After several years of manual labor Kelly became the prosperous owner of the complex of mills along Karakung Creek. Kelly and his mills attracted the first Irish Catholics to the otherwise Protestant community. 1860 census records attest to the Irish presence and their occupations in the mills. In 1822, mindful of duty to community and faith, Kelly bought and donated land opposite the Friends’ Meeting House on the hilltop above the mills for the construction of the first Catholic Church. The second and more significant arrival of the Irish comes with the planned community of Brookline c.1925 and portions of Manoa and Oakmont. In 1927 the Church of the Annunciation and The Church of the Sacred Heart together with their schools assured Catholics seeking life in the suburbs of a religious home. The third and largest phase of the Irish move comes with the large brick house tract developments of Beechwood, Chatham Park and Manoa. Today according to the 2000 US Census, Haverford Twp. ranks in the top 60 of census-recognized municipalities nationwide in percentage of population with Irish ancestry.\n\nBubble Gum\n\nHavertown is the birthplace of Swell Bubble Gum, founded 1947, which closed in late 2004 and was demolished in 2011. In 2013, the site became the home of the new Haverford Area YMCA.\n\nHavertown is home to over 30 outdoor parks and playing fields. The town also provides other recreation facilities, including the Haverford Township Free Library, and the Haverford Township Skatium, a multi-use ice rink for Havertown residents.\n\nParks in Havertown include:\n\nLlanerch Park\n\nKarakung Field/Drive\n\nChatham Glen\n\nThe Grange Field\n\nHaverford Reserve/Freedom Playground\n\nThe concept for the Haverford Music Festival was introduced by the Haverford Township Civic Council (HTCC), a private, non-profit organization that funds historic, environmental, business, and community initiatives in Haverford Township. Inspired by the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Bethlehem Musikfest and other music festivals in the area, the all-day, family-oriented Haverford Music Festival has taken place annually in the Oakmont Business District of Havertown since 2011. In 2012, the festival attracted more than 15,000 people, who enjoyed over 30 bands on three stages. HTCC benefits from festival proceeds and uses to fund community-based programs within Haverford Township. Proceeds from the 2011 Music Festival were given to the Haverford Partnership for Economic Development (HPED) for Oakmont Business District Beautification.\n\nHavertown is served by the School District of Haverford Township, which has one high school, one middle school, and five elementary schools. A newly refurbished elementary school, Chestnutwold Elementary, re-opened its doors in early September 2008. It replaced Oakmont Elementary, which became home to the district offices. In 2009, Manoa Elementary School moved from Manoa Road to the intersection of Manoa and Eagle Roads, taking part of the field that had been there for many years. The Haverford High School sports teams are called the \"Fords,\" and have a Model T Ford as mascot.\n\nHaverford High School had the honor of being the only high school in the Philadelphia area to host the One Book, One Philadelphia author Julie Otsuka. Otsuka's \"The Buddha in the Attic\" is a recent PEN/Faulkner Award-winning work of historical fiction and a National Book Award finalist.\n\nCardinal John Foley Regional School is the area Catholic school. It formed in 2012 from a merger of Annunciation B.V.M. and St. Denis Catholic schools.\n\nThe town is protected by the Haverford Township Police Department and five volunteer fire companies that make up the Haverford Township Bureau of Fire:\n\nHavertown has a Superfund site caused by the National Wood Preservers wood treatment facility, which was in operation from 1947 to 1991. The chemical used to treat wood at this site was dumped into the ground. The Environmental Protection Agency began remediating the site in 1976, and they completed construction of the cleanup site on September 16, 2010. The groundwater continues to be extracted and treated on a continuous basis. Although approximately 26,000 people live within a mile of the site, there are no known users of the groundwater within a one-mile radius of the site. The nearby population is on the public water supply.\n\n\n"}

He joined forces with drummer Mike Gröger (Collapse 7, Bloo Vodoo, Only Attitude Counts, Mudbreed). At the urging of A.B.M.S. members, Martin Schirenc anonymously included two Vuzem tracks on self-produced compilation Norici Obscura Pars.\n\nFollowing favorable reviews and multiple requests, Martin decided to release a full-length recording of Vuzem's music. Other commitments, however, delayed the realization of this endeavor until late 1998, when unfinished material was brought to the attention of Napalm Records. Shortly thereafter, Vuzem signed to the label, releasing critically acclaimed debut Domus Mundi in 1999 under the Hollenthon banner.\n\nIn June 2001, Hollenthon released \"With Vilest of Worms to Dwell\". Not unlike its predecessor, it boasted a superb soundtrack-like production, as well as a fierce and wicked atmosphere created by a perfect symbiosis of heavy guitars, symphonic interludes, thrilling choirs, and bewitching melodies with samples from classical composers like i.e. Sergei Prokofiev (\"Montagues and Capulets\" from \"Romeo and Juliet\" in \"Lords of Bedlam\").\n\nThe album was promoted with a European tour together with Eisregen (GER) and Siebenbürgen (SWE). The live line up was completed with Mike's bandmates Mario Klausner (Collapse 7, Ex-Pungent Stench, Ex-Belphegor) and Werner Freinbichler (Collapse 7). The following years saw Martin concentrating on Pungent Stench although the writing of new material was never stopped. 2007 Hollenthon intended to return and continue to walk the chosen path. Wanting a real band and not just additional live musicians Martin and Mike chose to recruit Gregor Marboe, who Martin shared stages with since early 2006 in Pungent Stench on bass and backing vocals and who has been active in the Austrian scene for years in his bands Defender Kfs and Vargsriket. In need of a second guitarist Martin Arzberger (Molokh, Defender Kfs) was introduced to the band.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970391", "title": "Company B (band)", "text": "Company B (band)\n\nCompany B is an American Latin freestyle trio formed in 1986 by Cuban-American producer Ish \"Angel\" Ledesma (Foxy, Oxo), featuring members Lori L. (Ledesma), Charlotte McKinnon and Susan (Gonzalez) Johnson. Before the group's self-titled album was released, Charlotte McKinnon left and was replaced by Lezlee Livrano. After the group’s self-titled debut album, Susan Johnson left and was replaced by Sheena. For the group's second album, 1989's \"Gotta Dance\", Sheena and Lezlee Livrano both left the group and were replaced by Donna Huntley and Julie Marie (who also was a rotating performer with Exposé).\n\nCompany B resulted from the music trend of producer-driven girl groups in the late 1980s and early 1990s, most successfully the group Exposé. Company B's first single \"Fascinated\" was released in 1986 on the independent label The Summer. The song created so much buzz in clubs around Miami that it soon made its way to local radio stations. This in turn led to its being picked up and re-released by Atlantic records. With a much wider distribution due to major label (Atlantic Records) backing, \"Fascinated\" received significant radio and club airplay in all major cities throughout the U.S. It reached number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart and crossed over to pop radio, peaking at number 21 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Today, it is regarded as a freestyle classic. The trio was best known for this single, as well as the platinum wigs that were initially a part of the group's image. The single did so well that the group was signed to do a full-length album. The album was released in 1987 on Atlantic Records. Although subsequent releases \"Full Circle,\" \"Perfect Lover,\" and \"Signed in Your Book of Love\" received club play and led to appearances on such programs as \"Showtime at the Apollo\", the songs received little airplay on American radio.\n\nIn 1989, Company B released its follow-up album \"Gotta Dance\", sporting a revamped image: gone were the platinum wigs. Also seemingly gone were the Latin-flavored rhythms of the previous album. Singles culled from the album included the house-influenced \"You Stole My Heart,\" \"Gotta Dance,\" and a cover of the Andrews Sisters song \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" (the song that served as inspiration of the group's name). Despite music videos for \"You Stole My Heart\" and \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\" the group did not attain the same success as they did with their debut effort. A third album recycled a few songs from the first album, including the track \"Jam on Me,\" which included additional lyrics.\n\nIn 2006, Company B regrouped, with original lead vocalist Charlotte McKinnon and original member Susan (Gonzalez) Johnson, joined by newest member Rachel Leslie. They had been performing extensively over the past few years and released new material.\n\nIn 2014, original member Susan (Johnson) Gonzalez purchased the Trademark, Company B and is registered with the USPTO.\n\nIn 2016 Susan (Johnson) Gonzalez hired Gail Smith Hoyer to manage the group. Gail assisted Susan in branding the name, hire new member Siddy Betancourt, update costumes, choreography, and music. In 2017 they did a remake of \"Cruel Summer\" by Bananarama. Gail took advantage of Social media and came up with the idea of an online show \"In the Kitchen\" with Company B and together with Susan they put it into action. Later that year Company B parted ways with Gail and hired new manager Roy Bermingham (Roy B). In 2019 present members include original member Susan (Johnson) Gonzalez, Dalia Chirinos, and Siddy Benancourt. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970395", "title": "Enigmosaurus", "text": "Enigmosaurus\n\nEnigmosaurus (meaning \"Enigma lizard\" or \"Enigmatic lizard\") is a genus of therizinosaur theropod dinosaur that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period. It was a medium-sized, ground-dwelling, bipedal herbivorous that represents the third therizinosaur taxon from the Bayan Shireh Formation, although it is known from the lower part. The genus is monotypic, including only the type species \"E. mongoliensis\", known from a well preserved pelvis and other tentative body remains.\n\nThe holotype, IGM 100/84, was discovered at the Khara Khutul locality in the Bayan Shireh Formation (sometimes called Baynshire Formation or the Baynshirenskaya Svita), southeastern Mongolia, dating from the Late Cretaceous period, and first reported in 1979 on a pelvic comparison with other theropod dinosaurs. At the time, little was known about therizinosaurs. In 1980, it was mentioned again, this time in the new infraorder created by the mongolian paleontologists Rinchen Barsbold and Altangerel Perle: Segnosauria. Nicknamed as the \"Dinosaur from Khara Khutul\", it was shortly described and included into the Segnosauria.\n\nThree years later, the type species, \"Enigmosaurus mongoliensis\", was named and described in 1983 by Barsbold. The preserved elements consist of a partial skeleton, lacking the skull, that includes a well preserved pelvic girdle with other postcrania. The generic name, \"Enigmosaurus\", was stated to be derived from Greek αίνιγμα (aínigma, meaning enigma) and σαῦρος (sauros, meaning lizard), in reference to the aberratic and unusual shape of its pelvis. The specific name, \"mongoliensis\", refers to the country of its discovery, Mongolia. Some therizinosaur fossil findings at the Iren Dabasu Formation were first thought to be referable to \"Enigmosaurus\".\n\nSome paleontologists proposed that \"Enigmosaurus\" was likely the same animal as \"Erlikosaurus\", since both were found in the same geologic formation, \"Enigmosaurus\" is known from pelvic remains, whereas the pelvis of \"Erlikosaurus\" is unknown and distinguishing traits between them were absent; if proven, this would make \"Enigmosaurus\" a junior synonym of \"Erlikosaurus\". However, the \"Enigmosaurus\" pelvis doesn't resemble that of \"Segnosaurus\" as would be expected for the connection with \"Erlikosaurus\", and there is a huge size difference. In addition, both genera are known from different strata (lower and upper), and they are considered to be distinct animals by most authors.\n\nThe holotype pelvis is in relatively good preservation, compromising the sacral vertebrae, partial illium, right and left pubis and the left ischium. The pelvis is somewhat large as a whole and opisthopubic. The illium is widely positioned and turned externally; it preserves a large cubic process in the posterodorsal area. Elongated pubic peduncles are present in the illium; the ischial peduncles are more reduced though. The distal end of the pubis is elongated, recurved and stocky. The ischium, is slightly shorter than the pubis and parallel to it, with a narrow shaft. The obturator process on the front edge of the ischium is horizontally elongated and low. Open edges are appreciable on the large trochanteric fossa. Apparently, the sacrum preserves six vertebrae, with elongated transverse processes. For instance, its pelvis is very particular compared to other therizinosaur relatives, featuring areas of bone resorption and bone remodeling on the illium. These specific traits may indicate the advanced age of the individual, if true, the fusion of the obturator process and pubic body could be discarded as an authentic autapomorphy for the species. Zanno noted that more analyses are required to settle this enigma.\n\n\"Enigmosaurus\" was a relatively large-bodied therizinosaur, with an estimated length of and a weight between . Although it is commonly known from the pelvis, several remains not mentioned in the original description of the holotype were labelled under the same specimen number (IGM 100/84). These elements are in poor condition compared to the pelvis, and they were not measured and illustrated: proximal end of a femur; large femoral shaft, might be a tibial shaft; some ribs; distal end of a humerus; a tentative radius and the proximal end of an ulna. The femur however, was not found in association with the holotype individual, therefore it should be assigned to \"therizinosauria incertae sedis\"; the other remains might pertain to the holotype. A very large left femur, measuring long, was labelled with the same specimen number too, however, it was not associated with the holotype due to its large size (larger than the pelvis itself). Nevertheless, it seems to approach the size of the closer \"Segnosaurus\".\n\nAs noted by Barsbold in the original description of \"Enigmosaurus\", it can recognised by the following characteristics: the pubis and ischium are short; elongated margin in the anterior presymphyseal region of the distal pubis. However, in the revised diagnosis by Zanno et al. 2010, there are even more specific traits for \"Enigmosaurus\" that were not pointed out/analyzed before: prominent cranial and caudal processes on the dorsoventrally somewhat flattened pubic boot; the pubic feet are fused, being medially elongated, a medial expansion forms a V-shaped structure; the medial fusion of the obturator process and pubic body, forms a tetraradiate process.\n\n\"Enigmosaurus\" was by the describers assigned to a separate Enigmosauridae (now obsolete) due to its aberrant pelvis, but later considered a member of the Segnosauridae which are today called the Therizinosauridae. Lindsay Zanno in 2010 recovered a position more basal in the Therizinosauroidea.\n\nBelow are the results of the recently performed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria by Hartman et al. 2019, in which \"Enigmosaurus\" is recovered in a basal position.\n\nThe remains of \"Enigmosaurus\" were found in sediments that were deposited during the Late Cretaceous period on the Bayan Shireh Formation, Khara Khutul locality, about 95.9 ± 6.0 million to 89.6 ± 4.0 million years ago, Cenomanian-Santonian ages. Being a therizinosaur, it was likely a slow herbivore and/or omnivore, as suggested by most authors all over the time. The biodiversity across the formation was characterized by therizinosaurs, as seen on the remains of \"Enigmosaurus\", \"Erlikosaurus\" and \"Segnosaurus\". The holotype location, Khara Khutul, has also yielded the contemporary \"Segnosaurus\" and an unnamed velociraptorine. Most of the remaining paleofauna from this formation is known from Uppper strata, whereas \"Enigmosaurus\" is known from Lower strata.\n\nAt the locality, diverse paleoflora has been discovered, such as Cornaceae reported with \"Bothrocaryum gobience\" and \"Nyssoidea mongolica\" as fine representatives. Numerous fossil fruits findings at the locality reflect the large presence of angiosperm plants on the formation. The unearthed fruits bear some resemblance with \"Abelmoschus esculentus\", however, definitive taxonomic affinities are quite unclear.\n\n"}
{"id": "1970401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970401", "title": "Antonio Lauro", "text": "Antonio Lauro\n\nAntonio Lauro (August 3, 1917 – April 18, 1986) was a Venezuelan musician, considered to be one of the foremost South American composers for the guitar in the 20th century.\n\nAntonio Lauro was born in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela. His father Antonio Lauro Ventura, an Italian immigrant, was a barber who could sing and play the guitar so he taught his son what he could, but died when Antonio was still a child. After the family moved to Caracas, Lauro pursued formal musical study (piano, composition) at the \"Academia de Música y Declamación\", where the composer Vicente Emilio Sojo (1887–1974) was one of his teachers. A 1932 concert performed in Caracas by Agustín Barrios, the Paraguayan guitarist and composer, so much impressed the young Lauro (already an accomplished folk guitarist) that he was persuaded to abandon piano and violin in favor of the guitar. From 1933, Lauro studied with Raúl Borges (1888–1967), and was introduced to the classical guitar repertoire. In the next decade, Borges' pupils would also include Rodrigo Riera, José Rafael Cisneros, and Alirio Díaz. These colleagues, especially Díaz, were later responsible for unveiling Lauro's works to an international audience, introducing these unheard works to, among others, Andrés Segovia, Leo Brouwer and John Williams.\n\nLike many South Americans of his generation, Lauro was a fervent cultural nationalist, determined to rescue and celebrate his nation's musical heritage. As a member of the \"Trio Cantores del Trópico\" in 1935–1943 (Lauro sang bass and played both guitar and \"cuatro\"), he toured nearby countries to introduce them to Venezuelan music. Lauro was particularly attracted to the myriad colonial parlour \"valses venezolanos\" (Venezuelan waltzes) created in the previous century by accomplished national composers such as Ramón Delgado Palacios (1867–1902). Unfailingly melodic and characterized by a distinctive syncopation (created by a hemiola in which two measures of 3/4 become a single measure of 3/2), such music was precisely the sort of folkloric raw material which Smetana, Bartók or Granados had elevated to the category of national art in Europe.\n\nA concert whose programme consisted entirely of such \"valses venezolanos\" (Venezuelan waltzes) by the distinguished Venezuelan pianist Evencio Castellanos (1914–1984) convinced Lauro that the guitar, too, should have comparable pieces in its repertory. Among his first efforts in this genre were the pieces later known as Tatiana, Andreína, and Natalia, composed sometime between 1938 and 1940; their instant popularity inspired still others. In addition to his guitar pieces, Lauro composed dozens of works for orchestra, choir, piano and voice; many of which remain unpublished. He occasionally experimented with modern compositional techniques, but most of his guitar music remains essentially on the \"Calle Real\" or \"main street,\" an expression used by musicians of Lauro's generation to refer to a straight and direct route, without distracting harmonic detours.\n\nIn 1948, the military \"junta\" of General Marcos Pérez Jiménez imprisoned Lauro for his principled belief in democracy. Lauro later shrugged off the experience, telling his friends that prison was a normal part of life for the Venezuelan man of his generation. He had continued composing even in prison, and after his release immediately returned to performing with a pioneering professional classical guitar trio, the freshly formed Trio Raúl Borges. In the following decades Lauro's compositions were published, recorded and performed throughout the world, and his contributions to his nation's musical life were recognized and acknowledged. Lauro was appointed professor of guitar at several distinguished schools including the \"Juan José Landaeta Conservatory\", and was named president of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra where he played the horn. In spite of his modest insistence that he was a composer rather than a performer, he was persuaded by his friends to embark upon a solo concert tour, which began in Venezuela and culminated in a triumphant 1980 performance at London's Wigmore Hall. Shortly before his death at Caracas in 1986, he was presented with the \"Premio Nacional de Música\", his country's highest artistic award.\n\n\nThe works of Antonio Lauro have long been very popular with guitarists worldwide, yet there have been few recordings devoted exclusively to him. However, several recordings by Adam Holzman, John Williams (guitarist) and David Russell have been issued. John Williams is quoted as having referred to Antonio Lauro as being the \"Strauss of the guitar\".\nAnother recording worth mentioning, \"A Tribute to Antonio Lauro\" by Thomas Cronin (guitarist), recorded initially for Irish National Radio on the RTE label, gained great appeal with Venezuelans worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, Lauro's masterpieces have been the core of studies, workshops and Masters in universities all around the World.\n\nSeries of articles published in CLASSICAL GUITAR MAGAZINE Magazine.

Thus, redistributions were not predictable and occurred only when consensus in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick demanded it. Throughout most of New Brunswick's early history redistribution was a result of the addition of new counties, upon which the districts were based, which expanded from seven in 1785 to fifteen in 1874.\n\nStarting in 2005-2006, electoral distributions were undertaken under statutory requirements first immediately thereafter and initially after every decennial Canadian census starting in 2011, however the Act was later amendment to hold them after every two general elections.\n\n\nFrom the founding of New Brunswick until 1995, no electoral district crossed a county line. All districts through this time period can be traced back to one of New Brunswick's original 8 counties. From the 1973 redistribution until the abolishment of these districts at the 1995 election, all districts had 1 member.\n"}

He fought during the Hunnish invasion of 376, engaged in war with Rome from 376 to 383, and incursions into the Balkans in 387. He is most famous for his participation at the Battle of Adrianople in 378.\n\nAfter the death of the Gothic King Vithimiris while fighting against the Huns in 376, Alatheus became, with Saphrax, co-regent and guardian of Vithericus, infant son of Vithimiris. He helped in the leadership of the great Gothic migration before the Hun onslaught, he crossed the Danube while Rome was busy with Thervingi refugees in that year. He soon allied himself with the Thervingi leaders Fritigern and Alavivus against Rome.\nAlatheus eluded the Romans and rampaged through Thrace and Moesia in 377–378. He marched to Fritigern's aid against Emperor Valens at the battle of Adrianople in 378, in which Valens was killed when Alatheus' forces were victorious. He continued to raid Thrace and northern Greece, but was defeated by Theodosius the Great's general Promotus, and he settled on the north side of the Danube. He appeared on its banks again in 386, with the intention of invading the Roman provinces again. His forces were, however, repulsed, and Alatheus was slain.\n\nSaphrax (died 400) was a Greuthungi chieftain, who led the tribe along with Alatheus. Both names appear to have been Alanic; they may have been Sarmatian/Alan. After the death of the King Vithimiris while fighting against the Huns in 376, Alatheus and Saphrax became regents and guardians of Vithericus, infant son of Vithimiris. He and Alatheus commanded the Greuthungi, while Fritigern commanded the Thervingi, numbering an army of 10,000 (according to contemporary Ammianus Marcellinus) in the Battle of Adrianople in 378 against the Roman Empire. It is theorized that Saphrax led a Hun-Alan contingent. Ending in defeat for Rome, many of their followers rampaged through the Eastern Empire until they were settled years after by Theodosius treaties in Pannonia Prima. Remnants were recruited into the Roman army.\n\n"}
{"id": "1970438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970438", "title": "Ian Hancock", "text": "Ian Hancock\n\nIan Francis Hancock (Romani: Yanko le Redžosko; born 29 August 1942) is a linguist, Romani scholar and political advocate. He was born and raised in England and is one of the main contributors in the field of Romani studies.\n\nHe is director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at The University of Texas at Austin, where he has been a professor of English, linguistics and Asian studies since 1972. He has represented the Romani people at the United Nations and served as a member of the US Holocaust Memorial Council under President Bill Clinton, who, Hancock claims, has Romani ancestry. He also represented the Romani people at the 1997 Rafto Prize award.\n\nHancock was born in London in 1942. His mother, Kitty, is Romanichal; his father, Reginald (Redžo), was part Romungro, the descendant of a Hungarian speaker of North Central Romani named Imre Benczi. He acquired the surname Hancock by Imre's daughter, Maria, who married a member of an English West Country showman family of that name.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he became a Romani rights activist after reading reports about anti-Romani discrimination in Britain. In particular, he took up the cause of Romani rights after reading about an incident in which three Romani children were killed in a fire caused by a lamp after police officers, who had arrested their parents, attempted to use a bulldozer to forcibly remove their caravan while they were still inside. In 1971, he graduated with a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of London.\n\nHancock has published more than 300 books and articles on the Romani people and language (particularly the Vlax dialect). These works analyse the Romani people through not only Romani linguistics but also history, anthropology, and genetics. He has also appeared in the documentary \"American Gypsy.\" He is currently writing a book called \"On Romani Origins and Identity\".\n\nHancock supports some of Ralph Lilley Turner's views on Romani history based on the Romani language. In particular, Hancock agrees that the Dom left India much earlier than the Romani people ie before 1000 AD. In fact, he claims that the Indian musicians mentioned in the \"Shah-Nameh\" and the \"atsingani\" mentioned in \"The Life of St. George the Anchorite\", both of which were previously believed to be ancestors of the Romani people, may have been the ancestors of the Domari people but not of the Romani people. He considers it possible that the Lom split off from the Romani people on reaching Armenia.\n\nContrary to the popular view that the Romani people are descended from low-caste Indians who brought their occupations to Europe, he argues that the Romani people are descended from Indian prisoners of war of Mahmud of Ghazni. As evidence, he points to the presence of Indic words specifically of military origin and to a Banjara oral legend telling of Rajputs who left India through the Himalayas during the Ghaznavid invasions and never returned.\n\nHe also believes that the Romani language originates in a koine language, which he calls \"Rajputic,\" between the many Indian languages spoken by the prisoners of war. He finds it thus similar to several other Indian languages, especially Hindustani.\n\nAs for Romani history, he points out a \"Pariah syndrome\" throughout time and space, culminating in the attempted genocide at the hands of Nazi authorities that was simultaneous to that of the Jews and part of the same \"Final Solution of the Jewish and Gypsy Problem\" project.\n\nHancock is as well known in the field of linguistics, particularly in the area of pidgin and creole languages, as he is in the world of Romani studies and Romani social activism. In addition to his research on the Krio language of Sierra Leone, he has studied the Gullah language, of coastal South Carolina and Georgia, and the Afro-Seminole Creole language, spoken by a community of Black Seminole descendants in Brackettville, Texas. Hancock was the first scholar to report Afro-Seminole Creole. He later identified another variety of that language spoken among Black Seminole descendants in the village of in the Mexican state of Coahuila, where their ancestors had settled in 1850. He maintains that Afro-Seminole Creole and Gullah are closely related languages, as Black Seminoles were descended primarily from Gullah people of the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nHancock is recognised as one of the founders of the field of pidgin and creole linguistics. He has also done extensive research on the English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the West Indies. He is known especially for his views on the historical development of these languages. He maintains that all the English-based pidgins and creoles spoken in the Atlantic basin region, both in West Africa and in the Caribbean, belong to a single language family, which he calls the \"English-based Atlantic Creoles.\" He argues that all of them can be traced back to what he calls Guinea Coast Creole English, which arose along the West African Coast in the 17th and 18th centuries, as a language of commerce in the Atlantic slave trade. He says that Guinea Coast Creole English was spoken in coastal slave trading bases such as James Island, Bunce Island, and Elmina Castle, where the offspring of British slave traders and their African wives used it as their native language.\n\nHancock says that Guinea Coast Creole English ultimately gave rise to the pidgin and creole languages spoken in West Africa today, such as the Aku language in the Gambia, Sierra Leone Krio, Nigerian Pidgin English and Cameroonian Pidgin English. He also maintains that some of the Africans taken as slaves to the New World already spoke Guinea Coast Creole English in Africa. Their creole speech influenced the development of creole languages spoken today on the American side of the Atlantic, such as Gullah, Afro-Seminole Creole, Bahamian Dialect, Jamaican Creole, Belizean Kriol, Guyanese Creole, and Sranan Tongo in Suriname.\n\nHancock's views on the connections among the Atlantic creole languages is controversial. The strong similarities among these languages are undeniable, but many linguists prefer to explain the similarities by convergence rather than historical relationships. Other scholars argue that both factors played a role in the formation of the languages. Another group of linguists subscribes to a theory that attributes creole similarities (which extend to Indian Ocean creoles and Hawaiian Creole) to an innate \"bioprogram\" for language that emerges under the conditions common to most creole communities.\n\n"}

Following Allman's death in 1971, Betts assumed sole lead guitar duties during the peak of the group's commercial success in the mid-1970s. \n\nBetts was the writer and singer on the Allmans' only big hit single, \"Ramblin' Man\". He also gained renown for his ability to compose instrumentals, with one appearing on most Allman Brothers albums; the two most known being \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\" and \"Jessica\". \n\nHe was inducted with the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and also won a best rock performance Grammy Award with the band for \"Jessica\" in 1996. \nBetts was ranked No. 58 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in 2003, and #61 on the list published in 2011. \nBetts departed the Allman Brothers Band in 2000 under acrimonious circumstances and performed and recorded on his own. \n\nBorn in West Palm Beach on December 12, 1943 and raised in Bradenton, Florida, Betts grew up in a musical family listening to traditional bluegrass, country music and Western swing. He started playing ukulele at five and, as his hands got bigger, moved on to mandolin, banjo, and guitar. At sixteen and feeling the need for something \"a little faster,\" he played in a series of rock bands on the Florida circuit, up the East Coast and into the Midwest before forming Second Coming with Berry Oakley in 1967. According to Rick Derringer, the \"group called the Jokers\" referenced in \"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo\" was one of Betts' early groups.\n\nIn 1969, Duane Allman had parlayed success as a session player into a contract with Southern soul impresario Phil Walden, who planned to back a power trio featuring Allman. The ensuing Allman Brothers Band eventually grew to six members, including Duane's brother Gregg, Betts, and Oakley.\n\nAfter the death of Duane Allman in late 1971, Betts became the band's sole guitarist and also took on a greater singing and leadership role. Betts, over the course of one night's traveling, practiced slide guitar intensively in order to cover the majority of Duane's parts. He went on to write \"Jessica\" and the Allmans' biggest commercial hit, \"Ramblin' Man\". \"Jessica\" was inspired by his daughter of the same name.\n\nBetts's first solo album, \"Highway Call\", was released in 1974, and featured fiddle player Vassar Clements. After the Allman Brothers fell apart in 1976, Betts released more albums, starting with \"Dickey Betts & Great Southern\" in 1977, which included the song \"Bougainvillea\", co-written with future Hollywood star Don Johnson. In 1978 he released an album, \"Atlanta's Burning Down\".\n\nThe Allman Brothers reformed in 1979 for the album \"Enlightened Rogues\" with two members of Great Southern replacing Allman Brothers members unwilling to participate in the reunion: guitar player Dan Toler (for pianist Chuck Leavell) and bassist David “Rook” Goldflies (for bassist Lamar Williams). Several albums would follow with various personnel changes until steadily declining record and concert ticket sales and tensions around management issues led the group to again disband in 1982.\n\nBetts returned to his solo career, performing live at smaller venues and releasing the album Pattern Disruptive in 1989. When a one-off reunion tour was proposed in support of the Allman Brothers' \"Dreams\" box set released in 1989 to commemorate the band's 20th anniversary, Betts's solo band again supplied the Allman Brothers' other guitarist, slide guitarist Warren Haynes. The one-off tour's success resulted in a permanent reunion which absorbed Betts's energies for the remainder of the 1990s. This band lineup went on to release three acclaimed studio albums between 1990 and 1994.\n\nBetts was replaced on numerous Allman Brothers tour dates throughout the mid-to-late 1990s for what were reported in the media as \"personal reasons\". While remaining active as a touring band, they failed to release an album of new studio material after 1994's \"Where It All Begins\" until 2003's \"Hittin' the Note\". Haynes and Allman Brothers bassist Allen Woody formed Gov't Mule with former Dickey Betts Band drummer Matt Abts as a side project in 1994 and left the Allman Brothers for Gov't Mule full-time in 1997. Betts' last show with the Allman Brothers was at the Music Midtown Festival in Atlanta, Georgia on May 7, 2000.\n\nThings reached a breaking point when the remaining original Allman Brothers members – Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe – suspended Betts (reportedly via fax) before the launch of the band's Summer Campaign Tour 2000. According to Betts, the band told him in the fax to get clean (presumably from alcohol and/or drugs). Betts was subsequently ordered out of the band after the dispute went to arbitration.\n\nBetts was temporarily replaced for the 2000 tour by Jimmy Herring, formerly of the Aquarium Rescue Unit. When Betts filed suit against the other three original Allmans the separation turned into a permanent divorce. Although, separated personally and as musical band mates for over 15 years, Betts and Gregg Allman did reconcile before Allmans death in 2017 Betts re-formed the Dickey Betts Band in 2000 and toured that summer. The band reassumed the name Dickey Betts & Great Southern and added Betts' son Duane (named after Duane Allman) on lead guitar. In 2005 Betts released the DVD \"Live from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\".\n\nBetts married his fifth wife, Donna, in 1989. He has four children: Kimberly, Christy, Jessica, and Duane. Christy is married to Frank Hannon of the band Tesla. Duane, named for Betts' former bandmate Duane Allman, is also a musician who has performed and recorded with his father.\n\nIn August 2018, Betts suffered a mild stroke and had to cancel upcoming tour dates with his Dickey Betts Band. He was in critical yet stable condition at a Florida hospital following an accident at his Sarasota home. Surgery was planned for September 20, 2018. He successfully underwent surgery to relieve swelling on his brain. A statement posted on his website says Betts and his family said the \"outpouring of support from all over the world has been overwhelming and amazing. We are so appreciative.\"\n\nAlthough he briefly resided in Georgia during the formative years of the Allman Brothers Band, he has lived in the Sarasota metropolitan area for most of his life.\n\nBetts' name has been styled in several different ways on recordings throughout his career:\n\n\n"}

It is filled through a wider opening at the opposite end, rolled or twisted closed, and then squeezed to extrude its contents.\n\nThough a circular nozzle is quite useful for making round shapes and for filling pastries such as profiteroles, many differently shaped nozzles are commonly used to produce star, leaf, and flower-petal shapes.\n\nAside from icing, pastry bags are commonly used to shape meringue and whipped cream, and to fill doughnuts with jelly or custard. They are used to form cream puffs, éclairs, and ladyfingers. When presentation is especially important, fluted tips can be used to shape savory foods such as filling for deviled eggs, whipped butter, and mashed potatoes (especially for \"Pommes duchesse\").\n\nA high-quality reusable bag is often made from tightly woven nylon, polyester, rubber or waterproofed (plastic-coated) cotton. Medium quality bags are similar, except they are not so tightly woven and may let some contents seep through the weave or the seams. After use, a reusable bag is washed by hand and hung open to dry. A high-quality bag may last for many years.\n\nPastry bag users who do not have a dishwashing machine may prefer to use disposable bags, and thus avoid hand-washing messy bags. Disposable bags are ready-made in inexpensive plastic. A plastic food storage bag is also commonly used as a pastry bag. For small quantities and fine piping, a pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted chocolate, since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.\n\nTips come in sets of interchangeable pieces; expensive tips can be purchased one at a time. They may be chrome-plated or stainless steel, or plastic. Each tip is cone-shaped, with a base too large to fit through the small opening in the bag; they are to be inserted through the larger opening before food is spooned in. Tips can be used with pairs of adapter rings: an inner ring is dropped inside the bag and pushed part way out the hole, a tip is slipped over the ring, then an outer ring is slipped over the tip and screwed onto the inner ring. This permits the tip to be changed without emptying the bag. Some inexpensive sets are of disposable plastic film with a drop-in ring and screw-on plastic tips (see image above). Many foods (including frosting and pressurized \"spray can\" whipped cream) can be purchased in disposable packaging designed to serve the function of a pastry bag.\n\n"}

The strike began on August 12, 1994, and resulted in the remainder of that season being cancelled, including the postseason and, for the first time since 1904, the World Series. The strike was suspended on April 2, 1995, after 232 days, making it the longest such stoppage in MLB history and the longest work stoppage in major league professional sports at the time (breaking the record set by the 1981 strike); its length would be surpassed by the 2004–05 NHL lockout, which ran for 310 days and caused the cancellation of that league's entire 2004–05 season. 948 games were cancelled in all, and MLB became the first major professional sports league to lose an entire postseason due to labor struggles. Due to the strike, both the 1994 and 1995 seasons were not played to a complete 162 games; the strike was called after most teams had played at least 113 games in 1994. Each team played 144 games in 1995.\n\nIn response to a worsening financial situation in baseball, the owners of Major League Baseball teams collectively proposed a salary cap to their players. Ownership claimed that small-market clubs would fall by the wayside unless teams agreed to share local broadcasting revenues (to increase equity among the teams) and enact a salary cap, a proposal that the players adamantly opposed. On January 18, 1994, the owners approved a new revenue-sharing plan keyed to a salary cap, which required the players' approval. The following day, the owners amended the Major League agreement by giving complete power to the commissioner on labor negotiations.\n\nThe dispute was played out with a backdrop of years of hostility and mistrust between the two sides. What arguably stood in the way of a compromise settlement was the absence of an official commissioner ever since the owners forced Fay Vincent to resign in September 1992. Vincent said the owners had colluded in the signing of free agents, which led to \"a $280 million theft\" by Bud Selig and Jerry Reinsdorf, which \"polluted labor relations in baseball\" and left Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, with \"no trust in Selig.\" On February 11, 1994, the owners greatly reduced the commissioner's power to act in \"the best interests of baseball.\"\n\nOwner representative Richard Ravitch officially unveiled the ownership proposal on June 14, 1994. The proposal would guarantee a record $1 billion in salary and benefits. But the ownership proposal also would have forced clubs to fit their payrolls into a more evenly based structure. Salary arbitration would have been eliminated, free agency would begin after four years rather than six, and owners would have retained the right to keep a four- or five-year player by matching his best offer. Owners claimed that their proposal would raise average salaries from $1.2 million in 1994 to $2.6 million by 2001.\n\nFehr rejected the offer from the owners on July 18. He believed a salary cap was simply a way for owners to clean up their own disparity problems with no benefit to the players.\n\nOn July 13, 1994, Fehr said if serious negotiations between the players and the owners did not begin soon, the players could go out on strike in September of that year, threatening the postseason. On December 31, 1993, Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement ran out with no new agreement yet signed.\n\nAs negotiations continued to heat up, the owners decided to withhold $7.8 million that they were required to pay per previous agreement into the players' pension and benefit plans. The final straw came on June 23 when the Senate Judiciary Committee failed to approve an antitrust legislation by a vote of 10–7. According to Fehr, the action left the players with little choice but to strike. \"We felt in '94 we were pushed into it,\" he said. \"I still think that's a justified conclusion.\"\n\nOn July 28, the Players Association executive board set August 12, 1994, as a strike date. When that day came, the players went ahead with their threat to walk off the job. The last games of that baseball season were played on August 11, 1994.\n\nOn August 31, three-and-a-half hours of negotiations with federal mediators produced no progress in the strike, and no further talks were scheduled as the strike went into its 4th week. According to then-acting commissioner Bud Selig, September 9 was the tentative deadline for canceling the rest of the season if no agreement was reached between the owners and players. The MLBPA offered a counterproposal to ownership on September 8 calling for a two-percent tax on the 16 franchises with the highest payrolls to be divided among the other 12 clubs. Teams in both leagues would share 25% of all gate receipts under the MLBPA's plan. The owners responded by claiming that the measures wouldn't meet the cost.\n\nThe rest of the season, including the World Series, was called off by Bud Selig on September 14. Selig acknowledged that the strike had torn an irreparable hole in the game's fabric. The move to cancel the rest of the season meant the loss of $580 million in ownership revenue and $230 million in player salaries. In 1994, the average MLB salary was an estimated $1.2 million.\n\nThe Montreal Expos' best season in their history was stopped by the strike. They had the best record in baseball, 74–40, and were six games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East despite having the second-lowest payroll in MLB. Most baseball writers considered the Expos to be World Series contenders. Coincidentally, the only time that the Expos actually made it to the postseason was in 1981, the last time that there was a significant players' strike in Major League Baseball. That season, Montreal qualified by winning the 2nd half of the 1981 season.\n\nChicago White Sox star Frank Thomas, who wound up winning the American League's Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award for the second year in a row in 1994, said \"I've had a career year, but I'm not going to finish it.\" Tony Gwynn had a chance to be the first to finish a season over .400 since Ted Williams, as he was batting .394 at the time of the strike. The strike also cost Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants a chance to beat Roger Maris' single season home run record. When the strike forced the cancellation of the remaining 47 games of the season, Williams had already hit 43 home runs, on pace to match Maris' single season record of 61 home runs. Cleveland Indians second baseman Carlos Baerga was unable to extend his record two-year streak of 20 home runs, 200 hits, and 100 RBI by a second baseman because of the strike. Seattle Mariners star Ken Griffey, Jr., who led the American League with 40 home runs at the time of the strike, summed it up by saying, \"We picked a bad season to have a good year.\" Kevin Mitchell of the Cincinnati Reds, Julio Franco of the Chicago White Sox, and Shane Mack of the Minnesota Twins, all .325 hitters in 1994, opted during the strike to play in Japan in 1995.\n\nBy the third day of the strike, Cleveland Indians owner Richard Jacobs directed that all souvenirs being sold at the Indians' gift shop carrying the words \"inaugural season at Jacobs Field\" be sold at half price.\n\nThe Colorado Rockies were completing their last season at Mile High Stadium with an attendance of 3,281,511 through 57 home games for an average of 57,570 per game. At that pace, the team would have had a good chance of drawing over 4.6 million fans in their 81 home games if the season had continued. This would have eclipsed the major league season attendance record of 4,483,350 fans set by the Rockies only the season before.\n\nOne of the few positive notes was that fans were spared from witnessing one of the worst division races in history. The Texas Rangers were leading the newly reformed AL West despite being 10 games under .500. The last-place California Angels were only games out despite having the second-worst record in the majors at 21 games under .500—on pace for 96 losses. In fact, the two last place teams in the other American League divisions (namely, the Detroit Tigers of the AL East and Milwaukee Brewers of the AL Central) had better records than the Rangers.\n\nThe National League's MVP award was given to Jeff Bagwell. His hand was broken by a pitch on August 10, just before the players' strike began; had the season continued, he would likely have missed the remainder of the year and might not have won the MVP. But because of the timing of his \"lucky break\", Bagwell became just the fourth player in National League history to win the award unanimously.\n\nThe strike also led to an absurdity. The Minnesota Twins traded Dave Winfield to the Cleveland Indians for a player to be named later. Since the strike led to the season being cancelled, no further transactions could be made until it was settled. The Twins would officially be listed as having sold Winfield to the Indians, but the actual transaction was conducted much differently. Instead of the Indians buying the contract outright, team management went out for a meal with Twins management and the Indians paid the tab; this essentially meant that Winfield had been traded for dinner.\n\nArguably, the biggest storyline of the strike was the New York Yankees. In having the best record in the American League, which was also the second-best record in baseball, 70–43, and a game lead over the Baltimore Orioles in the AL East, the largest division lead of any division leader, the strike cost their captain, Don Mattingly, his best chance at his postseason debut in his 13-year career. The Yankees had not been in the postseason since 1981. Because the Yankees' prior postseason chances had also been cut short by a strike, news media reported on the parallels between the two Yankee teams (1981 and 1994), both of which had division leads taken away by strike actions. Mattingly would reach the playoffs for the first and only time in his playing career the following year, being defeated at the hands of the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS in five games.\n\nOn December 5, it was announced Richard Ravitch would step down as negotiator for the owners on December 31, 1994. Ravitch instead resigned on December 6, 1994. On December 14, labor talks headed by federal mediator William Usery broke down. The next day, the owners approved a salary cap plan by a vote of 25–3, but agreed to delay implementing it so that another round of talks with the players could be held. On December 23, with negotiations at a standstill, the owners unilaterally implemented a salary cap.\n\nOn January 4, 1995, five bills aimed at ending the baseball strike were introduced into Congress. The next day, Fehr declared all 895 unsigned Major League players to be free agents in response to unilateral contract changes made by the owners. On January 10, arbitrator Thomas Roberts awarded 11 players a total of almost $10 million as a result of collusion charges brought against the owners. On January 26, both players and owners were ordered by President Bill Clinton to resume bargaining and reach an agreement by February 6. Unfortunately, President Clinton's deadline came and went with no resolution of the strike. Just five days earlier, the owners agreed to revoke the salary cap and return to the old agreement.\n\nAfter the deadline passed with no compromises, the use of replacement players for spring training and regular season games was approved by baseball's executive council on January 13. Replacement players were reportedly guaranteed US$5,000 for reporting to spring training and another $5,000 if they made the Opening Day roster. Selig declared that, \"We are committed to playing the 1995 season and will do so with the best players willing to play.\"\n\nOn March 14, the players' union announced that it would not settle the strike if replacement players were used in regular season games, and if results were not voided. Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson was put on an involuntary leave of absence as he refused to manage replacement players.\n\nReplacement players created major issues for two American League teams. The Toronto Blue Jays would be unable to play games with replacement players or umpires in Ontario, due to labour code amendments passed by the Ontario NDP that prohibited replacement workers. This would be confirmed in a March 28, 1994 Ontario Labour Board hearing. Manager Cito Gaston and his coaching staff were sent to work with minor league players, and the team would announce that games featuring replacement workers would be played at their Spring training facility in Dunedin, Florida. The Baltimore Orioles, owned by prominent union lawyer Peter Angelos, announced they would also not be using replacement players. On March 20, Angelos's Orioles canceled the remainder of their spring training games. The next day, the Maryland House of Delegates approved legislation to bar teams playing at Camden Yards from using replacement players.\n\nOn March 26, the MLB announced that the 1995 season would be reduced from 162 games per team to 144 games per team as a result of the use of replacement players.\n\nFollowing the end of the 1993 season, CBS Sports lost the rights to broadcast baseball games on television. Production of nationally televised games was taken over by MLB itself, which sold the games as brokered programming to ABC and NBC as part of a joint venture that was referred to as The Baseball Network. Originally, the idea was for ABC and NBC to share a slate of games aired in prime time during the week, with the two networks alternating coverage of the All-Star Game and World Series and splitting the Division and League Championship Series between them. The agreement was to run for six seasons and end in 1999, with ABC and NBC airing the World Series and All-Star Game three times each.\n\nThe strike, however, resulted in ABC losing out on two weeks of coverage and the World Series and NBC losing out on all of its allotted regular season games. MLB and the local NBC and ABC stations lost a combined $595 million in advertising revenue, and both networks announced that they would be opting out of the deal after the shortened 1995 season; the Fox network became the new broadcast partner for MLB in 1996, and has remained as such since, although NBC stayed on and broadcast only the postseason until the 2000 season.\n\nOn March 28, 1995, the players voted to return to work if a U.S. District Court judge supported the National Labor Relations Board's unfair labor practices complaint against the owners (which was filed on March 27). By a vote of 27–3, owners supported the use of replacement players. The strike ended when Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction against the owners on March 31. On April 2, 1995, the day before the season was scheduled to start with the replacement players, the strike came to an official end at 232 days. Judge Sotomayor's decision received support from a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.\n\nAs part of the terms of the injunction, the players and owners were to be bound to the terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement until a new one could be reached and the start of the season would be postponed three weeks, with teams playing an abbreviated 144-game season instead of a 162-game season.\n\nDuring the first days of the 1995 season, some fans remained irate at both players and owners. Attendance at the games plummeted, as did television ratings, to a greater extent than during the last significant players strike in 1981.\n\nWhile a total of 50,010,016 fans had attended the 1,600 MLB regular season games played in 1994, averaging 31,256 per game, a total of 50,416,880 fans attended the 2,016 games of the 1995 MLB regular season, for an average attendance of just 25,008 per game. This represented a decline in average attendance of 20% from 1994 to 1995.\n\nA few of the fans who showed up demonstrated their frustration, and booed the players; the strike was seen as the worst work stoppage in sports history, leaving the game in crisis and some fans shaken and angry.\n\nAmong the major examples of fan protests:\n\nThe opening games were played with replacement umpires, the first time since Opening Day 1991 that replacement umpires were used.\n\nOn August 3, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a bill calling for the partial repeal of baseball's antitrust exemption to the full Senate. The vote was just 9–8. On August 9, George Nicolau, baseball's impartial arbitrator since 1986, was fired by Major League owners. On September 29, 1995, a three-judge panel in New York voted unanimously to uphold the injunction that brought the end to the strike in April 1995. The owners had appealed the injunction issued on March 31, but the panel said the Players Relations Committee had illegally attempted to eliminate free agency and salary arbitration.\n\nWhile replacement players from the 1995 spring training were allowed to play on postseason teams, these players were not allowed to have their names or likenesses on any commemorative merchandise; furthermore, they could not be featured in video games or tabletop games, and were instead replaced by placeholder players. The affected players include Shane Spencer of the 1998, 1999 and 2000 New York Yankees, Damian Miller of the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, Brendan Donnelly of the 2002 Anaheim Angels, Kevin Millar of the 2004 Boston Red Sox, and Jamie Walker of the 2006 Detroit Tigers.\n\nArguably the largest impact was to the Montreal Expos. The strike was considered to be start of the franchise's downfall in Montreal, eventually leading to their becoming the Washington Nationals. Not only did their dream season (first in MLB, six games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East) end abruptly, they were forced to lower payroll and sell off their four highest paid stars (Marquis Grissom, Ken Hill, Larry Walker, and John Wetteland) in the span of less than a week in spring training. With the strike negatively affecting its fan base, the Expos would never recover from the incident. Despite respectable performances in 1996, 2002 and 2003, the team never came close to contending again; the team was purchased by Major League Baseball after the 2001 season, and would become the focus of contraction rumors until the team was moved to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals after the 2004 season. The franchise won its first World Series in 2019, as the Nationals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970478", "title": "Fundulea", "text": "Fundulea\n\nFundulea is an agricultural town in Călărași County, Muntenia, Romania. It is on the Bărăgan Plain, approximately 30 km east of the capital Bucharest, in the historical region of Wallachia. It has a population of 6,217. The A2 freeway and Mostiștea River pass through its vicinity. Two villages are administered by the town: Alexandru Ioan Cuza and Gostilele.\n\nHistorically, Fundulea's outskirts housed a military base maintained by the Romanian Army. The town is home to an agricultural institute, the National Agricultural Research and Development Institute (, INCDA). A reservoir known as Lake Fundulea, fed by water from the Mostiștea, is a popular spot for sport fishing.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the village of Fundulea housed the \"Sionu\" estate of writer Gheorghe Sion, which, through the 1923 marriage of his daughter Marica, became the property of eccentric novelist, poet, and heraldist Mateiu Caragiale. Caragiale intended to turn it into a private domain, and reportedly flew an ensign he had created for himself.\n\nThe INCDA was created in 1962, during the Communist period, through the merger between the Research Institute for Maize Cultivation (\"Institutul de Cercetări pentru Cultura Porumbului\") and the Field Cultivation Department (\"Departamentul Culturilor de Câmp\") of the Romanian Agronomic Institute. \n\nFundulea is also the birthplace of novelist Mircea Nedelciu (1950-1999), in whose honor a local primary school was named in 2002.\n"}
{"id": "1970484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970484", "title": "Congregation of Christian Brothers", "text": "Congregation of Christian Brothers\n\nThe Congregation of Christian Brothers (officially, in Latin: \"Congregatio Fratrum Christianorum\"; members of the order use the post-nominal \"CFC\") is a worldwide religious community within the Catholic Church, founded by Edmund Rice (later beatified). Their first school was opened in Waterford, Ireland, in 1802. At the time of its foundation, though much relieved from the harshest of the Penal Laws by the Irish Parliament's Relief Acts, much discrimination against Catholics remained throughout the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland pending full Catholic Emancipation in 1829.\n\nThis congregation is sometimes confused with the De La Salle Brothers – also known as the Christian Brothers, Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools and Lasallians – founded in France by Jean-Baptiste de la Salle (later canonised). Rice's congregation is sometimes called the Irish Christian Brothers or the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers to differentiate the two teaching orders.\n\nSince the Second Vatican Council, the reputation of the congregation has been marred by widespread sexual abuse cases.\n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century, Waterford merchant Edmund Rice considered travelling to Rome to join a religious institute, possibly the Augustinians. Instead, with the support of The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Hussey, Lord Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, he decided to found a religious community dedicated to teaching disadvantaged youth.\n\nThe first school, on Waterford's New Street, was a converted stable and opened in 1802, with a second school opening in Stephen Street soon after to cater for increasing enrollment. Two men from his hometown of Callan, Thomas Grosvenor and Patrick Finn, soon arrived to aid Rice in his makeshift schools, with the intention of living the life of lay brothers. In the same year, Rice used proceeds from the sale of his victualling business to begin building a community house and school on land provided by the diocese. Bishop Hussey opened the new complex, christened “Mount Sion” on June 7, 1803, and pupils were transferred to the new school building the following year. The reputation of the school spread and across the next few years several men sought to become “Michaels”.\n\nOn 15 August 1808 seven men, including Edmund Rice, took religious promises under Bishop John Power of Waterford. Following the example of Nano Nagle's Presentation Sisters, they were called \"Presentation Brothers\". This was one of the first congregations of men to be founded in Ireland and one of the few founded in the Church by a layman.\n\nHouses were soon opened in Carrick-on-Suir, Dungarvan, and in 1811, in Cork. In 1812 the Archbishop of Dublin established a community in the nation's capital and by 1907 there were ten communities in Dublin, with pupils in excess of 6,000. The schools included primary, secondary and technical schools, along with orphanages and a school for the deaf. A community was founded in Limerick in 1816, followed by establishments in several of Ireland's principal towns.\n\nThe Holy See formally established the congregation in 1820. This, too, was an unusual event, since the Christian Brothers were the first Irish congregation of men approved by a charter from Rome.\n\nSome brothers in Cork chose to remain under the original Presentation rule and continued to be known as Presentation Brothers, a separate congregation but also recognising Edmund Rice as its Founder.\n\nThe congregation of Irish Christian Brothers spread to Liverpool and other parts of England. These new ventures were not always immediately successful. Two brothers had been sent to Gibraltar to establish an institute in 1835. However, despite initial successes they left in August 1837 on account of disagreements with the local priests. In 1878 the Brothers returned to the then Crown colony of Gibraltar. The school eventually flourished supplying education to the twentieth century. The \"Line Wall College\" was noted in 1930 for the education that it supplied to \"well to do\" children.\n\nSimilarly, a mission to Sydney, Australia, in 1842 failed within a couple of years. Brother Ambrose Treacy established a presence in Melbourne, Australia, in 1868, in 1875 in Brisbane, Australia, and in 1876 a school was commenced in Dunedin, New Zealand. In 1875 a school was opened in St. John’s, Newfoundland. In 1886 the Pope requested that they consider setting up in India, and a province of the congregation was established there.\n\nIn 1900 came the invitation to establish houses in Rome, and in 1906 schools were established in New York City. In 1940 Iona College was founded in New York, as a Higher Education College, facilitating poorer high school graduates to progress to a College education.\n\nIn 1925 the brother's bought St. Helen's, Booterstown which became their administrative headquarters and novitiate. Around 1968 land to the south was used to build two new schools Coláiste Eoin and Coláiste Íosagáin. St. Helen's was sold in 1988.\n\nIn 1955 Stella Maris College (Montevideo) in Uruguay was established. In 1972 the alumnus rugby team was travelling in Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 when it crashed in the Andes, stranding survivors in freezing conditions with little food and no heat for 72 days; 16 of the 45 people on the aircraft survived.\n\nIn 1967, the Christian Brothers had a membership of about 5,000, teaching in around 600 schools.\n\nThe Christian Brothers teacher training centre has become the Marino Institute for Education which has trained lay teachers since 1972 and has offered degrees validated by the University of Dublin since 1974. In 2012 Trinity College Dublin became a co-trustee with the Brothers of the Institute.\n\nThe Brothers' schools include primary, secondary and technical schools, orphanages and schools for the deaf. A number of these technical schools originally taught poor children trades such as carpentry and building skills for which they could progress to gain apprenticeships and employment. As the National School system and vocational schools developed in the Irish Republic, the Irish Christian Brothers became more concentrated on secondary education.\n\nAs of 2013, the Christian Brothers were living in 280 houses. \n\nIn 2008 it was reported that not more than ten Christian Brothers were teaching in Irish schools, with the expectation that there would soon be none. This was contrasted with the mid-1960s, when over 1,000 Brothers worked in schools, with no shortage of new recruits.\n\nGeographically, the Christian Brothers are divided into several provinces that encompass every inhabited continent. The brothers within each province work under the direction of a Province Leadership Team. In turn, the entire Congregation operates under the leadership of a Congregation Leadership Team that is based in Rome (and led by the Congregation Leader). These provincial and congregational teams are elected on a six-year basis at Congregation chapters.\n\nRestructuring has taken place in the congregation to account for the changing needs, in particular the declining number of brothers in the developed world. The three provinces of North America (Canada, Eastern American, and Western American Province) restructured into the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers North America on 1 July 2005. The provinces that cover Ireland, England and the Congregational Leadership Team in Rome combined into a single European province on May 5, 2007, while the five provinces covering Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea combined into one Oceania province on October 1, 2007, The English Province is a registered charity. The Dublin Headquarters are in the grounds of Marino Institute of Education, Claremont, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, Ireland.\n\nA special community within this new European province will be based in Geneva, Switzerland, working to establish an NGO known as Edmund Rice International. The purpose of such an organisation is to gain what is known as a \"general consultative status\" with the United Nations. \"This position allows groups the opportunity to challenge systemic injustice and to engage in advocacy work with policy makers on behalf of people who are made poor.\" As well as including Christian Brothers from provinces all over the world, members of the Presentation Brothers will also have a presence within this community.\n\nEdmund Rice Development is a faith-based non-governmental organisation with charity status in Ireland. Based in Dublin, Edmund Rice Development was established in 2009, to formalise the fundraising efforts of the developing world projects for the Christian Brothers globally and received its charitable status in 2009. Funding raised by the charity is directed mainly to nine countries in Africa, where The Christian Brothers work on mission in development: Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Additional funds are also raised for similar work in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay) and India.\n\nThe following is a list of the Superiors General of the Congregation of Christian Brothers. In recent times, \"Congregational Leader\" has been the title used.\n\nThe Irish Christian Brothers were strong supporters of Irish nationalism, the Irish language revival and Irish sports. In most of their schools in Ireland Gaelic football and hurling were encouraged as opposed to foreign sports and there were even examples of boys being punished for playing soccer. Conor Cruise O'Brien called them \"the most indefatigable and explicit carriers\" of the Catholic nation idea.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century many cases were exposed of emotional, physical and sexual abuse of children in the Christian Brothers' care over a number of decades. Cases emerged in Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse documented Christian Brothers activities in Australia and in particular in Ballarat. 22% of Christian Brothers across Australia have been alleged sexual predators since 1950, according to the royal commission. The commissioners concluded that the Christian Brothers \"completely failed... to protect the most vulnerable children in their care\" and that senior brothers–including Brother Paul Nangle, Ballarat's highest Brother in the 1970s–had deliberately misled police in more recent statements about their knowledge of abuse.\n\nThere were allegations that during the 1970s sexual abuses took place at the junior campus of St Patrick's College and St Alipius Primary School in Ballarat, Victoria. After investigation, Brothers Robert Best, Edward Dowlan and Stephen Francis Farrell were all convicted of sex crimes. Dowlan and Best were later transferred to the senior campus, and continued to offend. \"Four of the school's brothers and their chaplain, Gerald Ridsdale, were accused of sexually assaulting children — all but one, who died before charges could be laid, have been convicted.\"\n\nIn December 2014, a royal commission found that \"Christian Brothers leaders knew of allegations of sexual abuse of children at four Western Australian orphanages and failed to manage the homes to prevent the systemic ill-treatment for decades.\" During the 2016 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Ballarat, it was found that 853 children, average age 13, had been sexually abused by one or more Christian Brothers. Child abuse complaints had been made against 281 Christian Brothers, and the Congregation had paid A$37.3 million in compensation. \n\nThe Royal Commissions final report of Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat was released on 6 December. The report found that 56 Christian Brothers had claims of sexual abuse made against them in Ballarat and that there “was a complete failure by the Christian Brothers to protect the most vulnerable children in their care”. \n\nThe response to complaints of sexual abuse was \"grossly inadequate\": most often Christian Brothers were moved to a new location after an allegation had been made.\n\nThe Report found: \"Often, the Christian Brother in question was allowed to remain in the position he held where the allegations arose, with continuing access to children,\" and \"On many occasions, the Brother was moved to a new location after a complaint or allegation was made about his conduct. In some cases, the reason given for the move was to conceal the true reason for it and to protect the reputation of the Christian Brothers and avoid scandal and embarrassment.\"\n\nIn February 2020, Rex Francis Elmer pleaded guilty to two charges of indecently assaulting boys at St Vincent’s Boys’ Orphanage in South Melbourne. He was removed from St Vincent’s in 1976 after a welfare officer who inspected the orphanage complained that he had “interfered with” boys who lived at the home. He was appointed headmaster of a Melbourne Catholic boys school a few years after the religious order became aware of his abuse.\n\nIn December 2012, the Christian Brothers school St Ambrose College, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was implicated in a child sex abuse case. A former lay teacher was convicted of nineteen counts of sexual assault occurring between 1972 and 1991.\n\nThe Congregation of the Christian Brothers published full-page advertisements in newspapers in Ireland in March 1998, apologizing to former pupils who had been ill-treated whilst in their care. This advertising campaign expressed \"deep regret\" on behalf of the Christian Brothers and listed telephone lines which former pupils could ring if they needed help. In 2003 the Congregation brought a case against the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse seeking to prevent the Commission from naming brothers accused of child abuse. Justice Seán Ryan declared that individual alleged perpetrators of abuse would not be named unless they had already been convicted \n\nIn May 2009 a report was issued by an independent government commission on child abuse committed on thousands of children in residential care institutions run by various religious institutes for the Irish state. This report found that sexual abuse of boys in institutions run by the Brothers was common. In response, the Irish ecclesiastical province issued a pledge to pay 161 million euros toward a fund set up to compensate male and female victims of such abuse in both their institutions and those run by other religious institutes. the Christian Brothers in Ireland continued to seek out-of-court settlement for historical claims initiated by survivors of sexual assault by Brothers committed in day schools managed by the order in Ireland. Towards Healing was set up by CORI to offer therapy to survivors of clerical abuse; it is a Catholic organisation about whose independence there has been controversy. The Christian brothers in Ireland used the services of the L&P group to set up an education trust.\n\nIn late November 2009 the organization announced they would supply a €161 million (£145 million sterling) package as part of reparations for child abuse in Ireland. This includes a donation of €30 million to a government trust and €4 million donated to provide counselling services. Playing fields owned by the organisation and valued at €127 million would be transferred to joint ownership of the government and the trust that runs former Christian Brothers schools.\n\nIn 2016 Fr. John Farrell, Retired priest of the Diocese of Motherwell, the last Head teacher at St Ninian's Falkland, Fife, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. His colleague Paul Kelly, a retired teacher from Portsmouth, was given ten years, both were convicted of the physical and sexual abuse of boys between the years 1979 and 1983. More than 100 charges involving 35 boys were made. The school closed in 1983.\n\nIn 1987 men came forward to say that when they were being raised in Mount Cashel Orphanage in St. John's Newfoundland, from the 1950s until the 1970s, they had suffered physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and that when the Archdiocese became aware of the abuse, it removed brothers who were guilty of these acts, but took no other immediate action. Both the St. John's Archdiocese through the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as the Congregation of Christian Brothers have since enacted policies aimed at the prevention of child sexual abuse.\n\nChristian Brother Robert Brouillette, who had taught at St. Laurence High School, was arrested in April 1998 in Joliet, Illinois, for indecent solicitation of a child. He was convicted in March 2000 of 10 charges related to child pornography. In 2002 a civil lawsuit was filed in Cook County, Illinois, against Brouillette for sexual assault against a 21-year-old man.\n\nIn 2013 the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers North American Province, known as Irish Christian Brothers, paid US$16.5 million to 400 victims of child sexual abuse across the US, and agreed to enforce a zero-tolerance policy for brothers accused of abuse. This followed the Brothers filing for bankruptcy in April 2011 following rising legal costs, leading to a reorganization settlement between creditors and the order according to the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy code.\n\nThe Christian brothers composed and published a number of text books on several subjects, many in the Irish language, which were used by their schools.\n\n\n\"Our Boys\" was a magazine for boys by Christian Brothers and the Educational Company of Ireland, published from September 1914 until the 1990s. It was based on British \"Boys Own\" adventure comics, with illustrated strips and adventure stories in English and Irish. It had an overt Catholic and Irish Nationalist outlook, featuring Irish Legends, GAA figures, the Missions and Catholic juvenile organisations. Illustrator Gerrit van Gelderen contributed to the magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970496", "title": "Lead paint", "text": "Lead paint\n\nLead paint or lead-based paint is paint containing lead. As pigment, lead(II) chromate (PbCrO, \"chrome yellow\"), Lead(II,IV) oxide, (PbO, \"red lead\"), and lead(II) carbonate (PbCO, \"white lead\") are the most common forms. Lead is added to paint to accelerate drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. It is one of the main health and environmental hazards associated with paint. In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use, whereas countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.\n\nLead white was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described by Pliny the Elder, Vitruvius and the ancient Greek author Theophrastus.\n\nThe traditional method of making the pigment was called the stack process. Hundreds or thousands of earthenware pots containing vinegar and lead were embedded in a layer of either tan bark or cow dung. The pots were designed so that the vinegar and lead were in separate compartments, but the lead was in contact with the vapor of the vinegar. The lead was usually coiled into a spiral, and placed on a ledge inside the pot. The pot was loosely covered with a grid of lead, which allowed the carbon dioxide formed by the fermentation of the tan bark or the dung to circulate in the pot. Each layer of pots was covered by a new layer of tan, then another layer of pots. The heat created by the fermentation, acetic acid vapor and carbon dioxide within the stack did their work, and within a month the lead coils were covered with a crust of white lead. This crust was separated from the lead, washed and ground for pigment. This was an extremely dangerous process for the workmen. Medieval texts warned of the danger of \"apoplexy, epilepsy, and paralysis\" from working with lead white.\n\nDespite the risks, the pigment was very popular with artists because of its density and opacity; a small amount could cover a large surface. It was widely used by artists until the 19th century, when it was replaced by zinc white and titanium white.\n\nThe dangers of lead paint were considered well-established by the beginning of the 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, Sherwin-Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint \"poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors\". As early as 1886, German health laws prohibited women and children from working in factories processing lead paint and lead sugar. In 1786, Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter warning a friend about the hazards of lead and lead paint, which he considered well-established.\n\nThe League of Nations began efforts to ban lead paint in 1921.\n\nLead paint is hazardous. It can cause nervous system damage, stunted growth, kidney damage, and delayed development. It is dangerous to children because it tastes sweet, therefore encouraging children to put lead chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths. Lead paint is dangerous to adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women. Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted. Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen. High levels may result in death.\n\nLead paint is banned in the European Union by the 2003 Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), which forbids hazardous substances in consumer goods, including paint. This act superseded and harmonized existing laws of the member states, many of which had banned lead paint years before.\n\nTo protect the painters' health, France had already passed in 1909 a law banning the use of paints containing lead for the painting of the interior and exterior of all buildings. \n\nIn Canada, regulations were first enacted under the Hazardous Products Act in 1976 that limited lead content of paints and other liquid coatings on furniture, household products, children's products, and exterior and interior surfaces of any building frequented by children to 0.5% by weight. New regulations on surface coating materials, which came into force in 2005, further limit lead to its background level for both interior and exterior paints sold to consumers. Canadian paint manufacturers have been conforming to this background level in their interior and exterior consumer paints since 1991. Nevertheless, a Canadian company, Dominion Colour Corporation, is \"the largest manufacturer of lead-based paint pigments in the world\" and has faced public criticism for obtaining permission from the European Chemicals Agency to continue to export lead chromate paints from its Dutch subsidiary to countries where its uses are not tightly regulated.<\n\nThe United States' Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned lead paint in 1977 in residential properties and public buildings (16 CFR 1303), along with toys and furniture containing lead paint. The cited reason was \"to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings\". For manufacturers, the CPSC instituted the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which changed the cap on lead content in paint from 0.06% to 0.009% starting August 14, 2009. In 2018 the State of Delaware banned the use of lead paint on outdoor structures. Also, the Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act (AKA the \"Lead Paint Act\") was created in order to ensure that the disclosure of any lead-based hazards in a building be discussed with potential buyers or renters of units.\n\nIn April 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency required that all renovators working in homes built before 1978 and disturbing more than six square feet of lead paint inside the home or 20 square feet outside the home be certified. EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule) lowers the risk of lead contamination from home renovation activities. It requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities and pre-schools (any child occupied facility) built before 1978 be certified by EPA and use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices.\n\nAs of 2018, there are an estimated 37 million homes and apartments with lead paint in the United States.\n\nThe Philippines banned lead paint in 2013, but in 2017, 15% of the paint still was not certified. The EcoWaste Coalition and the Philippine Association of Paint Manufacturers declared on January 1, 2020 that the Philippines has phased-out lead paint following the implementation of Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Administrative Order 2013–24, or the Chemical Control Order for Lead and Lead Compounds, which directed manufacturers of lead-containing paints for industrial uses to phase out such paints by December 31, 2019.\n\nLead paint is not prohibited in India. A 2015 study found that over 31% of household paints in India had lead concentration above 10,000 parts per million (ppm), which far exceeds the BIS standard of 90 ppm for lead in paint.\n\nIn South Africa, the Hazardous Substances Act of 2009 classifies lead as a hazardous substance and limits its use in paint to 600 parts per million (ppm). A proposed amendment will modify this to 90 ppm, thereby almost completely eradicating lead from paint. The amendment would also include all industrial paints, which were previously excluded.\n\nIn art, white lead paint is known as \"flake white\" or \"Cremnitz white\". It is valued for the ease of handling and resilience the lead confers to oil paints. Lead white paint dries relatively quickly to form a strong, flexible paint film. Lead-based white is one of the oldest manufactured pigments. It was the only white pigment available to artists in appreciable quantities until the twentieth century, when zinc white and titanium white became available. Industrially produced lead white, the typical pigment from the 19th century until its ban, was thought to be inferior to traditionally fabricated forms, which had larger \"flake\" particles that conferred ease of handling.\n\nTitanium and zinc whites are far less toxic than lead white and have largely supplanted it in most fine arts applications. Safety regulations have also made lead white more expensive and difficult to obtain in some regions, such as the EU. Lead white oil paints are still produced and in use by artists who prefer their unique handling, mixing, and structural qualities.\n\nFlake white has various drawbacks, including a tendency to become transparent over time. It also blackens in the presence of certain atmospheric pollutants, although this can be reversed.\n\nLead is not a traditional pigment in water media, as zinc is superior for works on paper, as is calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) for frescos. Lead-based paints, when used on paper, often cause the work to become discolored after long periods; the paint's lead carbonate reacts with hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, which often come from fingerprints.\n\nPaint manufacturers have replaced white lead with a less toxic substitute, titanium white (based on the pigment titanium dioxide), which was first used in paints in the 19th century. Titanium dioxide is considered safe enough to use as a food coloring and in toothpaste. It is also a common ingredient in sunscreen. When used in paints today, it is often coated with silicon or aluminium oxides for durability. Titanium white has far greater opacity and tinting strength than lead white, and it can easily overpower most other pigments if not mixed carefully. Titanium white has been criticized for leading to \"chalkiness\" in mixtures, and for allegedly decreasing the permanence of organic pigments mixed with it due to its high refractive index.\n\nZinc white is less opaque and weaker in tinting strength than either titanium white or lead white. It is commonly used to lighten mixtures subtly while maintaining transparency. Although zinc white is the standard white in watercolors, its structural soundness in oils has been debated. Zinc white dries slowly and creates a relatively inflexible paint film. Critics of the pigment argue that its use leads to excessive cracking and delamination, even when used sparingly.\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the French grands établissements.\n\nOriginally a department of the École pratique des hautes études, an institution created in 1868 with the purpose of training academic researchers, the EHESS became an independent institution in 1975. Today its research covers the fields of Economics and Finance (through the Paris School of Economics), Cognitive Sciences, Humanities, Political Sciences, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Development studies, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Musicology, and Philosophy of social science.\n\nThe institution is concentrated on scholarly research and some of its faculty (known as \"directeurs d'études\") have achieved international recognition in different areas: in economics, Thomas Piketty and Nobel laureate Jean Tirole; historians such as Fernand Braudel and Lucien Febvre; anthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro and Marcel Mauss, sociologists such as Pierre Bourdieu, Edgar Morin and Alain Touraine; philosophers such as Jacques Derrida, and interdisciplinary scholars such as Marcel Mauss and Raymond Aron. As a higher education institution under the jurisdiction of the French Ministry of Education, the EHESS trains academic researchers and professors specialised in the social sciences. It awards graduate degrees, such as the master of research and the doctorate, as well as a school diploma. Some of them are awarded conjointly with institutions such as the École Normale Supérieure, the École Polytechnique, the École pratique des hautes études, and some of the universities of Paris.\n\nThe EHESS is a grande école and, as such, is not part of the mainstream university system. It evaluates students through a selection process based on the research project of the applicants. The scholars in training are free to choose their own curriculum among the large quantity of seminars offered by the school. The école has a small student-faculty ratio (830 researchers for 3000 students). Most faculty belong to other institutions, mostly within the CNRS but also other schools of Université PSL such as the ENS, the EPHE and the ENC, schools of Université Paris-Saclay such as Télécom ParisTech and the ENSAE, and some of the universities of Paris.\n\nOriginally part of the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) as its \"VI Section: Sciences économiques et sociales\", the EHESS gained autonomy as an independent higher education institution on 23 January 1975. The creation of a dedicated branch for social science research within the EPHE was catalyzed by the \"Annales\" historical school and was supported by several academic initiatives of the Rockefeller Foundation, dating to the 1920s. After WWII, the Rockefeller Foundation invested more funds in French institutions, seeking to encourage non-Marxist sociological studies.\n\nThe VIth section was created in 1947, and Lucien Febvre took its head. Soon after its creation (1947), the \"VI Section\", later EHESS, became one of the most influential shapers of contemporary historiography, area studies and social sciences methodology, thanks to the contribution of eminent scholars such as Fernand Braudel, Jacques Le Goff and François Furet. F. Braudel succeeded L. Febvre in 1956. He concentrated the various study groups at the well-known building on boulevard Raspail (area of allée Claude-Cahun-Marcel-Moore), in part by financing from the Ford Foundation.\n\nToday, the EHESS is one of France's \"Grands établissements\". It functions as a research, teaching, and degree-granting institution. It offers advanced students high-level programs intended to lead to research careers. Students are admitted on the relevance of their research project and undertake at the EHESS master programs and doctoral studies. The main areas of specialization include: history, literary theory, linguistics, philosophy, philology, sociology, anthropology, economics, cognitive science, demographics, geography, archaeology, psychology, law, and mathematics. The institution's focus is on interdisciplinary research within these fields. The EHESS has more than 40 research centers (among which are several joint research units with the CNRS) and 22 doctoral programs, 13 of which are in partnership with other French Universities and \"Grandes écoles\".\n\nThe school is a constituent college of the federal PSL Research University. Other institutions include the College de France, the École Normale Supérieure, the École pratique des hautes études, Chimie ParisTech, ESPCI ParisTech, the École des mines, and Paris Dauphine University.\n\nLucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel were members of the École des Annales, the dominant school of historical analysis in France during the interwar period. However, this school of thought was contested by the growing importance of the social sciences and the beginning of structuralism. Under pressure from Claude Lévi-Strauss, in particular, they integrated new contributions from the fields of sociology and ethnography to event-based historical analysis, a concept put forward by the Annales school, to advocate for the concept of \"a nearly imperceptible passage of history\". They were reproached, along with the structuralists, for ignoring politics and the individual's influence over his fate during a period in which the colonial wars of liberation were taking place.\n\nThe work of Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie and other historians working under their influence greatly affected the research and official teaching of history in France beginning in the 1960s. The work of Jean-Marie Pesez renewed interest in the issue of methodology in medieval archeology and created the idea of \"material culture\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, EHESS became the center of New History under the influence of Jacques Le Goff and Pierre Nora. During this period, a generation of ethnologists working under the ideas of Georges Balandier and Marc Augé were critical of the French colonial tradition and applied modern sociological concepts to third world countries.\n\nIn 2019, held the New Polish School of Holocaust Scholarship conference. The conference was disrupted by Polish nationalists. EHSSS President, Christophe Prochasson, said he could not recall such a violent disturbance at any scientific conference. Minister Frédérique Vidal condemned Polish authorities.\n\nPierre Bourdieu, Luc Boltanski, Alain Touraine, Jean-Claude Passeron have all been associated with EHESS.\n\nEHESS has always been a central place for economic debate in Europe. In France this debate is also enabled by the proximity of the researchers in Paris with national economic institutions: In this sense EHESS's advisors who have been drawn from economic professors have enjoyed a large media audience (a case example was Jean Fourastié). The diversity of viewpoints has been a priority, and liberal and Marxist economists have had the chance to debate in EHESS. Since the 1970s and 1980s EHESS has focused on quantitative economics, with classes led by well-known professors such as Louis-André Gérard-Varet, Jean-Jacques Laffont, François Bourguignon and Roger Guesnerie. They initiated not only the Paris School of Economics but the Toulouse School of Economics and Grequam (Aix-Marseille).\n\nMore than 50% of the student body comes from countries other than France.\n\nThe school is a founding member of the Paris School of Economics, Toulouse School of Economics, and Aix-Marseille School of Economics, the three French leading centers in Quantitative Economics. Since 2014 it is an associated member of the Paris Research University (PSL). \n\nEHESS has exchange programs with universities such as Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, Yale, Berkeley, Columbia and Michigan State in the United States, Heidelberg in Germany, Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan, Peking in China, the European University Institute in Florence, etc. Also, it has many relations and exchange programs with universities in Asia and the Middle-East; it holds research centers on Asian Studies and Islamic Studies.\n\n\nPast and present faculty (including EPHE's VI Section):\n\n\n"}

Originally a teacher, he was an entrepreneur who built political contacts along with a business empire, leading to various government and political positions at the state (State of Mexico) and national level. He was prevented from seeking the presidency due to laws requiring both parents to be Mexicans by birth; his father was German. He became a main powerbroker of then ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and was regarded as \"the most powerful fixture in Mexican politics for 30 years because his influence extended beyond the length of any one presidential term.\" \n\nCarlos Hank González was born in Santiago Tianguistenco in the State of Mexico. He graduated from the Escuela Nacional de Toluca as a primary education teacher and from the Normal Superior (Teacher's College) de México as a professor of history and biology. From 1947 to 1951 he was a teacher at the Secundaria Federal de Atlacomulco. To supplement his income, he sold candy on the side. He grew and exchanged his small businesses into larger ones, along the way adding names of prominent politicians to his list of contacts. He founded a business empire of banking and transportation interests, including the foundation of airline Taesa. In 1999, Forbes estimated his wealth at about US$1.3 billion but other sources say that figure should be much higher.\n\nHe married Guadalupe Rhon, with whom he had five children, 3 boys and 2 girls. He is the father of Carlos Hank Rhon, Cuauhtemoc Hank Rhon, and Jorge Hank Rhon and grandfather of Carlos Hank González who now heads the company called Grupo Financiero Interacciones.\n\nHank González's political career began when he moved from Atlacomulco to Toluca to take charge of the State of Mexico's Departmento de Escuelas Secundarias y Profesionales (Department of Professional and Secondary Schools) as well as the Oficina de Juntas de Mejoramiento Moral, Cívico y Material (Office of Committees for Moral, Civic and Material Improvement) between 1952 and 1953. The following year he was in charge of the treasury for the municipality of Toluca. From 1955 to 1957 he was the president of the ayuntamiento of Toluca.\n\nHis federal service began in 1961 when he became a congressman (diputado federal) for the XLIV Legislature. However, at the height of his political career, he served as the governor of the State of Mexico from 1969 to 1975 and was appointed \"regent\"(similar to mayor) of Mexico City in 1976. Federally, he served as Secretary of Tourism from 1988 to 1990 when he was then named as Secretary of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources.\n\nHe was considered one of the leaders of the old guard wing of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) He began as chief of the Delegación del Sector Popular at district, state and national conventions of the PRI, then was a delegate for the party for the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche and Quintana Roo. He worked his way up to be a member of the Comisión Pólitica del Comité Ejecutivo Nacional, advising presidents of the party. His death not only left a vacant place in the party structure of the PRI but it also signaled the end of a cycle in Mexican politics where the PRI dominated everything.\n\nConstitutionally barred from running for the Mexican presidency by a provision then in force which excluded those with a foreign-born parent from holding the office. His father, Jorge Hank Weber, was German and a colonel in both the German and Mexican armies. However, Carlos Hank had great influence in the PRI party, culminating in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Other evidence of his wide-ranging connections came in the form of his birthday celebration every year on August 28, when \"The professor\" would have a grand party at his ranch called \"Don Catarino\" in Santiago Tianguistenco with thousands of invited guests.\n\nAs mayor of Mexico City, he built the Eje vial system of roads and other projects designed to make the city more car-friendly.\n\nIn 1997, Carlos Hank González suffered an embolism and died in 2001 of cancer, spending the last few years of his life in the United States for treatment.\n\nAccording to a report by the U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) nicknamed Operation White Tiger, he -and now his two sons- are so involved in drug trafficking and money laundering that they \"pose a significant criminal threat to the United States.\" While U.S. law enforcement officials have spent years investigating Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his sons Carlos Hank Rhon and Jorge Hank Rhon, the assessment by several agencies marks the first time that all three have been linked directly to the operations of major Mexican drug organizations. The report drew on information from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Customs Service, CIA, Interpol and others. The report says intelligence agencies had intercepted conversations of the Hank family coordinating drug shipments. The document concludes that the Hank family has laundered money on a massive scale, assisted drug trafficking organizations in transporting drug shipments, and is engaged in large-scale public corruption, and was closely associated with the late Juárez Cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes. A report by the World Policy Institute presented to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, described Carlos Hank as the \"primary intermediary between the multinational drug trafficking enterprises and the Mexican political system\".\n\nFollowing the media revelations about Operation White Tiger, the Hank family, which has denied it is linked to or protecting top Mexican narcotraffickers, lobbied the U.S. Justice Department. With the assistance of Republican former U.S. senator Warren Rudman, whom Carlos Hank Rhon hired to represent his interests in Washington, Hank secured from Reno a letter contradicting the NDIC analysis. The attorney general's retraction of an intelligence analysis based on dozens of past investigations on the Hank family and on new lines of inquiry came as a bitter disappointment to members of the San Diego-based Operation White Tiger Task Force. The Hanks and their supporters insist that Reno's intervention was just and that they have been victims of innuendo spread by their political and business rivals.\n\nFrom the start, agents involved in the probe feared that Washington would conclude that Operation White Tiger was too controversial and potentially too disruptive to Mexican-American relations for it to continue. They suspected it would be blocked, as previous investigations of top Mexican politicians.\n\n"}

It is made from lime plaster, which is rammed, polished, and treated with soap to make it waterproof and water-repellant. \"Tadelakt\" is labour-intensive to install, but durable. Since it is applied as a paste, tadelakt has a soft, undulating character, it can form curves, and it is seamless. Pigment can be added to give it any colour, but deep red is traditional. It may have a shiny or matte finish.\n\nThe term \"tadelakt\", meaning \"to rub in\", is an Amazighified expression from the Arabic word \"tadleek\" meaning \"to rub or massage.\"\n\n\"Tadelakt\" is thought to have evolved from \"qadad\", a similar plaster used in Yemen for millennia that is treated with calcium hydroxide and oils and fats instead of soaps.\n\nThe basic constituents of \"tadelakt\" plaster are:\n\nThe soap chemically reacts with the lime plaster, forming lime (calcium) soaps.

This was Grant's and Bergman's second film together, after Alfred Hitchcock's \"Notorious\" (1946), and was one of the first films to popularise artistic use of the technique of split screens. The film was remade for television in 1988 starring Robert Wagner and Lesley-Anne Down.\n\nAnna Kalman (Ingrid Bergman) is an accomplished London-based theatre actress who has given up her hopes of finding the man of her dreams. Through her brother-in-law, Alfred Munson (Cecil Parker), she meets a handsome economist, Philip Adams (Cary Grant). She is instantly captivated by him and expresses visible interest in him.\n\nAt the end of their first meeting, she makes a pass at him to go on a date sometime later to which he politely states that he is married. He further adds that he is separated and unable to get a divorce from his wife. Anna is seemingly unperturbed by the fact and still asks him out whereupon he agrees.\n\nThey hit it off on their first date and continue seeing each other frequently. Soon after, they fall in love. Anna is then cautioned by her sister Margaret (Phyllis Calvert) about the affair but she rebuffs her approach.\n\nAs their romance continues to blossom, Philip receives a temporary transfer notice to New York for his work at NATO which greatly distresses Anna as it will keep them apart for possibly five months.\n\nOn the day before Philip's scheduled sail, Alfred tells Philip that he knows Philip is a bachelor from Scotland Yard investigations and asks him the reason for this secret. Philip reveals that he is unenthusiastic about the idea of marriage but can't give up on women which led him to develop this white lie. However, he assures Alfred that he sincerely loves Anna. He also tells that he plans to surprise Anna on her birthday the next day by delaying his departure by a few days and visiting her at midnight.\n\nAnna informs Alfred and Margaret that she plans to go to New York to surprise Philip. To discourage her Alfred unwillingly discloses Philip's plan. Margaret further worsens the situation by stating that Philip is actually unmarried. Anna becomes furious upon learning this as she takes this as an insult to her dignity. She decides to go on as if nothing happened but secretly concocts a plan to get even with him.\n\nShe arranges an elaborate ruse where it will appear that she was having an affair with David, an old flame, when Philip comes to visit her at midnight on her birthday. But it does not go as planned when David meets an accident and she is informed that he can't come. She tries to solve it by making her elderly caretaker Carl (David Kossoff) play the part of David. Despite this, her plan goes haywire when Philip comes and actually proposes marriage to her and leaves when he mistakes Carl for David. She is absolutely distraught by this but luckily, Philip returns and she is able to clear up the confusion. She tells him that she is happy the way things are. But now Philip is adamant about getting married and tells her so. Hearing this, Anna becomes extremely happy and the film ends with the couple embracing each other.\n\n\nNo film studio sought the rights to the play \"Kind Sir\" so Norman Krasna's co-producers - Joshua Logan, Mary Martin, and Charles Boyer - agreed to Krasna's offer to buy the rights himself for $10,000. Krasna did not tell his fellow producers he had lined up Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman to star in a film.\n\nIn March 1955 United Artists announced Krasna would direct a film version for that studio. It was originally announced that the film would be made with either Marilyn Monroe or Jayne Mansfield, and with Clark Gable as the male star.\n\nKrasna asked Stanley Donen if he wanted to direct while the latter was making \"Kiss Them for Me\" with Grant. Donen agreed \"but only with Cary\". Grant agreed but only if his co-star was Ingrid Bergman (the two had last acted together in \"Notorious\" [1946]). Bergman agreed provided the film could be shot in England, as she had a theatre commitment in Paris. Krasna agreed to make the changes from the play. Donen and Grant formed a company together to make the film. In September 1957 Bergman announced she and Grant would star in the film for Warners.\n\nThe film ranked in the top 10 British box office hits in terms of gross profits in 1958. \"Kinematograph Weekly\" listed it as being \"in the money\" at the British box office in 1958.\n\nIt was popular and well reviewed. Logan saw the movie expecting to find it different from the play and was surprised to find it \"verbatim\" like \"Kind Sir\". \"Krasna's writing and my taste were more than vindicated,\" said Logan. \"Had I been well [directing the play] it would have been another story.\"\n\n\"Indiscreet\" was nominated for three Golden Globes, two BAFTAs and one Writers Guild of America award, but failed to win any of them.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film was remade as a 1988 television movie. It was announced in March 1987 as a vehicle for Robert Wagner. Wagner pitched the idea to CBS because he loved the original. Lesley Ann Downe's casting was announced in February 1988. Filming was supposed to start in February 1988 but was pushed back to mid April. Filming finished by May.\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote: \"Leslie-Anne Down obviously is no Bergman... Wagner is no Grant, try as he may... \"Indiscreet\" is more flimsy than brittle, filled with lighter-than-air dialogue and the old hiding-out-on-window- ledges and falling-out-of-rowboat gambits. On the up side there is Down, who at times looks positively Ava Gardnerian, whether parading around in backless dresses or demonstrating a very special talent for saucily closing doors with her tush.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" said: \"The vapidity of both [lead] performances is magnified by come-hither camera shots that linger too long on their empty faces... Down has a little more flounce to the ounce, but the best she can do as a woman deceived is to fly into a deep snit. Production values evoke the silky-bland noblesse oblige that has been canonized for TV by \"Dynasty\" and \"Knots Landing.\"\"\n\n\"Go out and rent the original on video cassette,\" said \"The New York Times\".\n\n"}

It is part of Tacoma Public Schools, or Tacoma School District No. 10 and is located in the Stadium District, near downtown Tacoma. The original building was severely damaged by a fire in 1898 while it was still a partially-constructed hotel designed by Hewitt & Hewitt being used for storage. It was reconstructed for use as a school beginning in 1906 according to designs by Frederick Heath, and a \"bowl\" stadium was added later in 1910.\n\nThe main building was constructed by architects Hewitt and Hewitt for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Tacoma Land Company at what was then known as Blackwell Point. Construction began in 1891 with the intention of building a luxury hotel resembling a French château. The Panic of 1893, however, brought construction to an abrupt halt when the Northern Pacific was faced with financial disaster. The unfinished building became a storage facility, with much of the building materials still inside. On October 11, 1898, the building was gutted by a massive fire. The walls remained standing, and the Northern Pacific began to dismantle the structure, removing some 40,000 of the unique Roman bricks manufactured by Gladding, McBean that would be used to construct still-existing train stations in Missoula, Montana, and Wallace, Idaho.\n\nThe Tacoma School District purchased the gutted building on February 19, 1904, with the intent of turning it into a high school. The redesign and later renovations were planned by the school's architect, Frederick Heath. It was repaired and renovated into a school. Despite its extraordinary locale and design, on the inside it looks, feels, and operates like a typical American high school.\n\nThe reconstructed building opened on September 10, 1906, as Tacoma High School. Seven years later, the name was changed to reference the adjacent Stadium Bowl. Later additions included a circular lunchroom, an underground swimming pool, a science and industrial arts complex, a gymnasium, and a multi-story parking lot structure with tennis courts on the roof.\n\nThe stadium, also designed by Frederick Heath, dates from 1910 and is in a location once known as Old Woman's Gulch. It was originally much grander than it is today, with a seating capacity of 32,000. Among those who spoke there were Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, William Jennings Bryan, and Billy Sunday.\n\nThe stadium was originally built in 1909–1910 using steam shovels and sluicing to move more than down the edges of the gulch to create a flat playing field of . Wooden molds were built to cast concrete for 31 rows of stadium seating surrounding the playfield.\n\nThe original structure exceeded what the soil could support. A restoration project in the 1970s had to sacrifice roughly half of the seating capacity because of instability. In 1981 a burst storm drain washed away the scoreboard and the bayward end zone of the football field. This was followed by a further restoration allowing the stadium to reopen in 1985.\n\nThe school was the filming location for many of the scenes of the 1999 movie \"10 Things I Hate About You\".\n\nIn 2005-2006 the school underwent a major renovation, seismic upgrade, historical restoration, and expansion. Bassetti Architects were the design architects, and Merrit Pardini Architects (later Krei Architecture) were the architects of record for this work. During the renovation, students were temporarily relocated to the old site of Mount Tahoma High School in the south end, just over away.\n\nThe centennial celebration of Stadium High School was held on September 16, 2006. The celebration was attended by 3299 alumni, setting a Guinness World Record for the largest recorded school reunion.\n\n\n"}

Specifically it is used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Kaposi's sarcoma. It is used by injection into a vein. A liposomal formulation known as liposomal daunorubicin also exists.\nCommon side effects include hair loss, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and inflammation of the inside of the mouth. Other severe side effects include heart disease and tissue death at the site of injection. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. Daunorubicin is in the anthracycline family of medication. It works in part by blocking the function of topoisomerase II.\nDaunorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1979. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 5.79 to 37.18 USD for a 20 mg vial. This amount in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 55.00 pounds. It was originally isolated from bacteria of the \"Streptomyces\" type.\n\nIt slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in the body. Treatment is usually performed together with other chemotherapy drugs (such as cytarabine), and its administration depends on the type of tumor and the degree of response.\n\nIn addition to its major use in treating AML, daunorubicin is also used to treat neuroblastoma. Daunorubicin has been used with other chemotherapy agents to treat the blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n\nDaunorubicin is also used as the starting material for semi-synthetic manufacturing of doxorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin.\n\nSimilar to doxorubicin, daunorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Daunorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication.\nOn binding to DNA, daunomycin intercalates, with its daunosamine residue directed toward the minor groove. It has the highest preference for two adjacent G/C base pairs flanked on the 5' side by an A/T base pair. Crystallography shows that daunomycin induces a local unwinding angle of 8°, and other conformational disturbances of adjacent and second-neighbour base pairs.\nIt can also induce histone eviction from chromatin upon intercalation.\n\nIn the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to isolate anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle in Apulia. A new strain of \"Streptomyces peucetius\" which produced a red pigment was isolated, and an antibiotic was produced from this bacterium that was found to have good activity against murine tumors. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name \"Dauni\", a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, \"rubis\", describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug saw success in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nHowever, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.\n\nIn 2015-16, a team at Ohio State University \"showed that, by carefully manipulating strands of viral DNA, an origami structure with complex folds can be created in just 10 minutes. Incredibly, these structures are only 100 nanometers across – that’s 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Small volumes of daunorubicin can be wrapped up in these minuscule pods, which can then be released into a leukemia cell-filled environment.\"\n\nDaunorubicin should only be administered in a rapid intravenous infusion. It should not be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, since it may cause extensive tissue necrosis.\nIt should also never be administered intrathecally (into the spinal canal), as this will cause extensive damage to the nervous system and may lead to death. Daunorubicin has been used intravitreally (inside the eye) for the purposes of preventing proliferative vitreoretinopathy, a common complication following retinal detachment surgery, but has not been found to be effective and is not used for any other ophthalmic purposes at this time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970544", "title": "Pyramid of Menkaure", "text": "Pyramid of Menkaure\n\nThe Pyramid of Menkaure is the smallest of the three main Pyramids of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau in the southwestern outskirts of Cairo, Egypt. It is thought to have been built to serve as the tomb of the fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Menkaure.\n\nMenkaure's pyramid had an original height of 65.5 meters (215  feet) and was the smallest of the three major pyramids at the Giza Necropolis. It now stands at 61 m (204 ft) tall with a base of 108.5 m (356 ft). Its angle of incline is approximately 51°20′25″. It was constructed of limestone and Aswan granite. The first sixteen courses of the exterior were made of the red granite. The upper portion was cased in the normal manner with Tura limestone. Part of the granite was left in the rough. Incomplete projects such as this pyramid help archaeologists understand the methods used to build pyramids and temples. South of the pyramid of Menkaure are three satellite pyramids, with each accompanied by a temple and substructure. The easternmost is the largest and a true pyramid. Its casing is partly of granite, like the main pyramid, and is believed to have been completed due to the limestone pyramidion found close by. Neither of the other two progressed beyond the construction of the inner core.\n\nIn the mortuary temple the foundations and the inner core were made of limestone. The floors were begun with granite and granite facings were added to some of the walls. The foundations of the valley temple were made of stone. However both temples were finished with crude bricks. Reisner estimated that some of the blocks of local stone in the walls of the mortuary temple weighed as much as 220 tons, while the heaviest granite ashlars imported from Aswan weighed more than 30 tons. It was not unusual for a son or successor to complete a temple when a Pharaoh died, so it is not unreasonable to assume that Shepseskaf finished the temples with crude brick. There was an inscription in the mortuary temple that said he \"made it (the temple) as his monument for his father, the king of upper and lower Egypt.\" During excavations of the temples Reisner found a large number of statues mostly of Menkaure alone and as a member of a group. These were all carved in the naturalistic style of the old kingdom with a high degree of detail evident.\n\nThe pyramid's date of construction is unknown, because Menkaure's reign has not been accurately defined, but it was probably completed in the 26th century BC. It lies a few hundred yards southwest of its larger neighbours, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu in the Giza necropolis.\n\nRichard Vyse, who first visited Egypt in 1835, discovered on 28 July 1837 in the upper antechamber the remains of a wooden anthropoid coffin inscribed with Menkaure's name and containing human bones. This is now considered to be a substitute coffin from the Saite period. Radiocarbon dating on the bones determined them to be less than 2,000 years old, suggesting either an all-too-common bungled handling of remains from another site, or access to the pyramid during Roman times. Deeper into the pyramid, Vyse came upon a basalt sarcophagus, described as beautiful and rich in detail with a bold projecting cornice, which contained the bones of a young woman. Unfortunately, this sarcophagus now lies at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, having sunk on October 13, 1838, with the ship \"Beatrice\", as she made her way between Malta and Cartagena, on the way to Great Britain.\nIt was one of only a handful of Old Kingdom sarcophagi to survive into the modern period. The lid from the anthropoid coffin mentioned above was successfully transported to England and may be seen today at the British Museum.\n\nAt the end of the twelfth century al-Malek al-Aziz Othman ben Yusuf, Saladin's son and heir, attempted to demolish the pyramids, starting with that of Menkaure. Workmen recruited to demolish the pyramid stayed at their job for eight months, but found it almost as expensive to destroy as to build. They could only remove one or two stones each day. Some used wedges and levers to move the stones, while others used ropes to pull them down. When a stone fell, it would bury itself in the sand, requiring extraordinary efforts to free it. Wedges were used to split the stones into several pieces, and a cart was used to carry it to the foot of the escarpment, where it was left. Despite their efforts, workmen were only able to damage the pyramid to the extent of leaving a large vertical gash at its northern face.\n\n\n"}

The original numbering plan area (NPA) was split twice: in 1957 to create area code 819, and in 1998 to create area code 450. In November 2006, the entire remaining area area 514 was assigned the second area code, 438, making ten-digit dialing mandatory in the Montreal area.\n\nThe incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) in the service area is Bell Canada. The major competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC's) are Vidéotron, Telus, Rogers.\n\nMontreal's local calls were originally handled manually by operators; a called party was requested by name before the first (four-digit) local numbers were assigned in July 1881. In 1898, exchange names (\"Main\", \"Westmount\", \"Uptown\" or \"East\") were added before the number. The initial rotary dial exchange, \"Lancaster\", was deployed April 25, 1925. Subscribers dialled two letters of an exchange name and four digits (2L+4N), so \"Lancaster 1234\" became LA-1234 (or 52-1234).\n\nThe initial area codes were created in 1947 as routing codes for operator-assisted calls. Québec and Ontario were the only provinces that received multiple area codes. Quebec was split between area codes 514 and 418. 514 was originally assigned to the entire western half of Quebec, from the Canada–US border to the Hudson Strait. This area nominally included several remote areas in the far northern portion of the province which, at the time, did not have telephone service. When the Bell System implemented direct distance dialing (DDD) for content-wide service using a seven-digit local telephone number, prefixed by a three-digit area code, Montreal and Toronto, the largest Canadian cities, were still using six digits (2L-4N) numbering plans. Between 1951 and 1958, telephone numbers were lengthened by adding one digit (3L-4N) to be compatible. Numbering plan area 514 was split in 1957 to create area code 819 for most of western Quebec, from Estrie (Sherbrooke) to the Ontario border, with the then-unserved far northern portion nominally added to 418 (and later moved to 819). 514 was reduced to the region surrounding Montreal.\n\nThis configuration remained unchanged for 41 years. In 1998, the off-island suburbs (Laval, Montérégie, etc.) received area code 450, which now completely surrounds 514. This left 514 as the Island of Montreal and a few surrounding smaller islands, making it one of the six pairs of \"doughnut area codes\" in the numbering plan, and the only one in Canada.\n\nThe 1998 split was intended as a long-term solution to a shortage of available numbers in Canada's second-largest toll-free calling zone. However, within less than a decade, 514 was close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of computer, pager, and cell phone technologies, a problem exacerbated by the proliferation Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. Unlike the United States, Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure. Every competing carrier is assigned blocks of 10,000 telephone numbers, corresponding to a single central office prefix, in every rate centre where it plans to offer service. Once a telephone number is allocated to a carrier and rate centre, it cannot be reused elsewhere, even when a rate centre has more than enough numbers to serve it. This resulted in thousands of wasted telephone numbers. Many larger cities have multiple rate centres which have never been amalgamated. Montreal is an exception; it is Canada's second-largest rate centre.\n\nThe number allocation problem was not as severe in Montreal as in other areas of Canada, since numbers tend to be used up fairly quickly. However, it was apparent that the area needed another area code. On November 4, 2006; Numbering plan area 514 was overlaid with area code 438. This required ten-digit dialing for all subscribers in the Montreal area, even for local calls. By this time, overlays had become the preferred relief measure in Canada, as they affect existing subscribers the least and provide a workaround for the number allocation problem. No area codes have been split in Canada since 1999. \n\nAlthough the number allocation problem has never been addressed, under current projections, Montreal will not need another area code until 2023. Despite Montreal's continued growth, 514/438 is nowhere near exhaustion.\n\nArea code 438 was considered for overlaying 450 as well, but a later decision determined that 579 would be the overlay code for that area.\n\nAs of February 2017, Area code 263 is reserved for a third area code in the region.\n\n\nA few western on-island suburbs (the \"West Island\") were never combined into the main Montreal rate centre and therefore have a reduced subset of the Montreal local calling area. In some cases, the corresponding municipality disappeared in the 2002-06 forced amalgamation, but the restricted local calling area remains. These arbitrary boundaries do not necessarily correspond in any way to the original boroughs, the \"une île, une ville\" municipal amalgamation or the subsequent de-fusion of areas like Westmount.\n\n\nDue to Canada's number allocation system, when a CLEC reserves one prefix for each of the island's six rate centres (including Montreal), it has the effect of reserving 60,000 numbers before enrolling its first subscriber.\n\n"}

{"id": "1970574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970574", "title": "Potato ricer", "text": "Potato ricer\n\nA potato ricer (also called a ricer) is a kitchen implement used to process potatoes or other food by forcing it through a sheet of small holes, which are typically about the diameter of a grain of rice.\n\nA common variety of potato ricer resembles a large garlic press. It has two long handles, one with a perforated basket at the end, the other with a flat surface that fits into the basket. The food is placed in the basket, then the flat surface is pushed down into the basket by pressing the handles together, forcing the food through the holes.\n\nAnother form, sometimes called a rotary ricer, is cone-shaped with small perforations all around the cone. It comes with a wooden pestle that is used to push the food through the holes.\n\nA food mill can be used as a substitute for a ricer.\n\nThis tool is commonly used to rice potatoes, a process that forces cooked potatoes through the ricer and turns the potatoes into fine, thin shreds. The resulting potatoes are lighter and fluffier. The process allows the full starch cells of high-starch potatoes to maintain their integrity and stay separate, giving the potatoes a fluffy, full texture. At this point, milk, butter, and other additives can easily be blended to maintain the starch structure, the result being consistent mashed potatoes. The process works since uniform texture is created due to the passing of potatoes through evenly sized holes, which ensures that the potatoes are smashed only once. With this method, the cell walls are much less likely to break open.\n\nPressing cooked vegetables and fruits through the small holes produces a puree comparable to using a drum sieve. Many foods can now be pureed more easily in a food processor; however, a manual method such as ricing is best for potatoes, which are starchy and become glutinous when over-processed. Ricers are often used to puree food for babies.\n\nA ricer can be used to remove excess water from foods such as cooked greens that are to be added to quiche, thawed frozen spinach, and sliced or grated potatoes to improve the quality of potato chips or hash browns made from them.\n\nRicers are also used to make \"Mont Blanc\" (a dessert of chestnut puree), \"lefse\" (a Norwegian) flatbread, spätzle (German noodles), \"passatelli\" (a type of Italian pasta), and process ice cream when making the German dish \"spaghettieis\".\n\nPotters and ceramicists use ricers to extrude \"hair\" for human heads or animal sculptures such as sheep.\n\n"}

He succeeded his half-brother, Yeonsangun, because of the latter's tyrannical misrule, which culminated in a coup placing Jungjong on the throne.\n\nOn the day Yeonsangun was deposed, soldiers belonging to the coup leaders surrounded the house of his half-brother Grand Prince Jinseong. He was about to kill himself, thinking that Yeonsangun was finally going to kill him; but, dissuaded by his wife later known as Queen Dangyeong, Grand Prince Jinseong found himself becoming the eleventh king of Joseon Dynasty, or King Jungjong.\nJungjong worked hard to wipe out the remnants of the Yeonsangun era by reopening the Seonggyungwan, royal university, and Office of Censors, which criticizes inappropriate actions of the king. However, during the early days of his reign, Jungjong could not exert regal authority freely because those who put him on the throne exercised immense power. When the three main leaders of coup died of old age and natural causes eight years later, Jungjong began to assert his authority and carried out a large-scale reformation of the government with help of Jo Gwang-jo and other Sarim scholars.\n\nJo Gwang-jo strengthened local autonomy by establishing a self-governing system called Hyang'yak, promoted Confucian writings by translating them into Korean hangul and distributing them widely, pursued a land reform that would distribute land more equally between the rich and poor, and introduced a supplementary system for recruiting talents to the government. He also believed that any talented people, including slaves, should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. As Inspector General, he enforced the laws strictly so that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the local populace during this time according to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nHowever, the reforms faced much opposition from conservative nobles who led the coup in 1506 that placed Jungjong in power. After four years of reformist agenda, Jungjong abruptly abandoned Jo Gwang-jo's programs because he either lost confidence in Jo's programs or feared that Jo was becoming too powerful. While Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo shared the reformist agenda, Jungjong was also chiefly interested in solidifying royal authority whereas the latter was more concerned with neo-Confucian ideology, according to which those who rule must be a virtuous example to the rest. Finally in November 1519, when conservative officials slandered Jo Gwang-jo to be disloyal by writing \"Jo will become the king\" () with honey on leaves so that caterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation, Jungjong executed Jo Gwang-jo on charge of factionalism and exiled many of his followers, abruptly abandoning his reforms. This incident is known as the Third Literati Purge of 1519 or Gimyo massacre of scholars.\n\nAfter Jo Gwang-jo's fall, King Jungjong never had the chance to rule on his own. His reign was marked by tumultuous struggle among various conservative factions, each of them backed by one of the King's queens or concubines. In 1524 the conservative factions collided with each other, one faction deposing the corrupt official Kim Anro. Kim Anro's followers took their revenge in 1527 by intriguing against Consort Park, one of the King's concubines, which led to her execution along with her son Prince Bokseong. Kim Anro came back to power and took revenge on his enemies until he was removed from government and then executed by the new queen's brothers, Yun Wonro and Yun Wonhyeong. However, Yun Im, ally of Kim Anro, was able to keep his nephew as crown prince since the new queen, Queen Munjeong, did not have a son until later. Injong would later be declared the crown prince. His uncle Yun Im competed for power with the Queen Munjeong 's brothers, Yun Won-hyeong and Yun Won-ro. Many officials and scholars gathered around the two centers of power and each group developed into separate political factions. Yun Im's faction became known as ‘Greater Yun’ and the Yun brothers' faction as ‘Lesser Yun’. Their conflict led to the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545 after Jungjong's death.\n\nAs the dynasty weakened as a consequence of the continual internal conflict, foreign powers driven away by earlier monarchs returned with much greater effect. Wokou pirates and privateers often plundered southern coastal regions, while the Jurchens attacked the northern frontier numerous times, bleeding the army dry.\n\nJungjong was a good and able administrator especially during the reform period led by Jo Gwang-jo. However, historians judge that he was a fundamentally weak king due to circumstances of his ascension to throne, too easily swayed by both Jo Gwang-jo and conservative ministers who placed him on the throne. Sometimes he was seen as a tragic figure who never wanted to be a king but was forced to become one and depose his loving queen under the pressure of the coup leaders, who killed her father during the coup. More recently, some historians have suggested that Jungjong was not actually manipulated by his ministers and in-laws, but rather used them to get rid of one another to strengthen regal authority albeit not so successfully. In either case, his reign was marred by much confusion, violence, corruption, and court intrigues. He has been especially criticized for allowing the Third Literati Purge of 1519 and executing Jo Gwang-jo and others on framed charges.\n\nIn the early days of reform, Jungjong encouraged the publishing of many books; but publications declined dramatically after the literati purge in 1519. He also tried to improve self-government of local areas and succeeded in reforming the civil service examination. In the latter days of his reign, he realized the importance of defense and encouraged military service.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In young adulthood, he formed a local branch of the Sich Society, an organization that promoted physical education and national consciousness. He formed the Bukovynian section of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. Under this party, he ran in the Bukovynian Diet in 1911.\n\nKoreichuk emigrated to Canada, apparently in the spring of 1913.

He batted and threw right-handed. Cuddyer was a two-time MLB All-Star, and won a Silver Slugger Award in 2013, when he led the National League in batting average. Cuddyer announced his retirement after the 2015 season. He was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame on August 19, 2017.\n\nCuddyer was born in Norfolk, Virginia and is a 1997 graduate of Great Bridge High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he was a standout athlete in baseball, basketball, and football as well as student body president and National Honor Society member. In 1997, he was named to the All-America First Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings. Cuddyer was named Virginia's Player of the Year and Gatorade National baseball Player of the Year in 1997. He was also a member of \"USA Today\"s All-Star and the USA Junior National teams in 1997.\n\nDuring his high school career, he played American Legion Baseball and was named the 2014 American Legion Graduate of the Year.\n\nCuddyer has given back to his hometown and high school many times during his career.\n\nCuddyer was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 1st round (9th pick) of the 1997 amateur draft, but did not sign until August. Cuddyer initially committed to play college baseball at Florida State but waited for the Twins' signing bonus offer to increase from $700,000 to $1.3 million before deciding to go professional. Consequently, he did not make his professional debut until 1998 when he was assigned to the Fort Wayne Wizards in the single-A Midwest League. Showing the tools that made him a first round draft pick and regularly named to the Baseball America's top minor league prospects, Cuddyer made steady progress through the Twins' minor league system and made his Major League Baseball debut on September 23, 2001 after hitting .301 with 30 home runs and 87 RBI in 141 games at AA New Britain. After hitting .309 with 20 home runs in 86 games at AAA Edmonton, Cuddyer would be called back up with the Twins for the 2002 stretch drive and would be named to the post-season roster where he would hit over .300 against the Oakland A's and the Anaheim Angels.\nDespite playing over half of his 676 minor league games at third base and another 166 games at second, prior to the 2004 season Cuddyer got most of his playing time as an occasional fill-in in the outfield. During 2004, Cuddyer started to see more time in the majors in the infield, playing second and third base. After the departure of veteran Twins third baseman Corey Koskie to the Toronto Blue Jays by way of free agency in 2005, Cuddyer became the Twins' starting third baseman. However, he struggled at third base and was relegated to a reserve role for much of 2005, although he did hit .263 with 12 home runs for the second season in a row.\n\nCuddyer underwent surgery to repair a tear in his right lateral meniscus in October 2005. The Twins then extended his contract on January 21, 2006, giving him a one-year deal worth $1.3 million. After beginning the 2006 season on the bench, Cuddyer emerged as a regular in right field and in the cleanup spot of the Twins batting order. He finished second to Justin Morneau in RBI for the Twins in 2006.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Cuddyer re-signed with the Twins with a three-year $24 million contract, with a $10.5 million club option for 2011.\n\nOn April 4, 2008, Cuddyer suffered a dislocated right index finger after sliding headfirst into third base. He also suffered a laceration on the knuckle after getting stepped on by Kansas City Royals third baseman Alex Gordon. He was put on the 15-day disabled list and was activated on April 25 against the Texas Rangers. On his second game after being activated, Cuddyer hit a three-run home run off Rangers' Scott Feldman, his first of the 2008 season.\n\nOn May 22, 2009 Cuddyer hit for the cycle in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Three months later, on August 23, 2009, Cuddyer hit two home runs in the same inning, the seventh inning of the Twins' game against the Kansas City Royals, becoming the 53rd player in Major League Baseball to accomplish this feat. He is the only player in major league history to have performed both offensive rarities in the same baseball season. During September and October 2009, Cuddyer moved back into the infield playing first base filling in for Justin Morneau. Cuddyer returned to the outfield at the start of the 2010 season, but also found playing time at first and third base.\n\nOn July 3, 2011, Cuddyer was named an All-Star for the first time as a managers' pick. On July 25, Cuddyer became the first Twins position player to pitch in a game in 21 years when he was inserted in the eighth inning of a Twins loss against the Texas Rangers, in which they lost 20–6. The right-hander gave up a double to Mike Napoli, a bloop single to Mitch Moreland, and walked Ian Kinsler with one out to load the bases. Cuddyer then retired Elvis Andrus on a fly ball and David Murphy on a pop-up for a scoreless inning.\nThe last Twins position player to pitch was outfielder John Moses against the California Angels on July 31, 1990.\n\nOn December 16, 2011, Cuddyer signed a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the Colorado Rockies. He chose to wear number 3 in order to honor Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, with whom he had grown close within the Twins organization before Killebrew's death.\n\nIn 2013, Cuddyer set a personal best with a 27-game hitting streak, the longest in Rockies history to that point. Cuddyer was also named an All-Star for the second time in his career. Cuddyer finished the 2013 regular season with a .331 batting average to win the batting title by 10 points over Atlanta's Chris Johnson. It was the 34-year-old outfielder's first batting title as the highest Cuddyer had hit in a season before 2013 was .285.\nOn August 17, 2014, Cuddyer again hit for the cycle, becoming the 30th player to hit for the cycle more than once and just the third player in history, after John Olerud and Bob Watson, to hit for the cycle in both the American and National Leagues. Cuddyer was the only player to hit for the cycle during the 2014 season.\n\nCuddyer signed a two-year contract with the New York Mets on November 10, 2014 worth $21 million. On July 24, 2015 Cuddyer was put on the 15 day disabled list due to a bone bruise in his left knee. With the Mets in 2015, Cuddyer appeared in the first World Series of his career, but the team would lose the series four games to one to the Kansas City Royals.\n\nOn December 11, 2015, Cuddyer announced his retirement via an article on \"The Players' Tribune\" titled \"Play Hard and Dream Big\".\n\nIn 1536 games over 15 seasons, Cuddyer posted a .277 batting average (1522-for-5488) with 809 runs, 333 doubles, 42 triples, 197 home runs, 794 RBI, 75 stolen bases, 527 bases on balls, .344 on-base percentage and .461 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage plying at all three outfield positions and first, second and third base. In 28 postseason games, he hit .306 (26-for-85) with 5 runs, 2 home runs and 8 RBI.\n\nMichael is the son of Henry Cuddyer and Marcia Harris. He has a younger sister named Katie. He married Claudia Rente, an English teacher, on November 11, 2006. She has worked for both Hickory High School and Great Bridge High School. Son, Casey Jonathan, was born on June 20, 2008, and fraternal twin daughters, Chloe and Madeline, were born on December 6, 2011.\n\nDue to a childhood virus, Cuddyer has been deaf in his left ear since he was eleven years old. However, he insists that his partial deafness has never interfered with his ability to hear teammates on the field and he does not view himself as hearing impaired.\n\n\n"}

Starting in 2016, it joined in a strategic alliance with Ithaka Harbors, which currently operates the services JSTOR, Portico, and Ithaka S+R.\n\nIn the late 1990s, as universities and libraries began to convert their slide libraries into local digital image databases, Artstor was created to address the growing need for a shared online image library that would be accessible to educational institutions worldwide. The Artstor Digital Library is intended to reduce redundant efforts of scanning and cataloging thousands of the same images from multiple repositories, and also to enable new digital image collections to be shared for teaching and research. The initiative paired innovative digital image and online technologies with Mellon Foundation’s ongoing mission to support higher education, museums, the arts, and art conservation to “bring about a substantial transformation in art-related teaching, learning, and research.”\n\nArtstor's primary goals as an organization are: to assemble image collections from across many time periods and cultures; to create an organized, central, and reliable digital resource that supports strictly non-commercial use of images for research, teaching and learning; and to work with the arts and educational communities to develop collective solutions for building, managing and sharing digital images for educational use. Like many non-profits, Artstor has a mixed business model; some services are provided on a fee basis (geared toward the size of the subscribing institution) and others are provided free of charge to the community.\n\nThe Artstor Digital Library includes a set of software tools to view, present, and manage images for research and teaching purposes. There are currently more than 1,500 Artstor institutional subscribers in over 45 countries, including colleges and universities, museums, libraries, primary and secondary schools, and other non-profit organizations.\nThe Artstor Digital Library offers a wide range of images needed for interdisciplinary teaching and research, including contributions from the leading museums, photo archives, libraries, scholars, photographers, artists, and artists’ estates. These diverse collections include: Magnum Photos, Carnegie Arts of the United States, The Illustrated Bartsch, the Mellon International Dunhuang Archive, The Huntington Archive of Asian Art, and The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Architecture and Design Collection, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bodleian Library, and more.\n\nThe Digital Library comprises more than one million images from hundreds of collections worldwide. The Digital Library is continually expanded by new contributions such as: Mark Rothko Estate; Latin American Art (Cisneros Collection); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA); Christopher Roy: African Art and Architecture; Berlin State Museums; the Gernsheim Corpus of Master Drawings (185,000 images of old master drawings); Larry Qualls Archive (100,000 images documenting 30 years of New York City gallery exhibitions); architectural photography from Esto, Canyonlights and ART on FILE; university collections from Harvard and Yale; and historical photo archives such as the National Gallery of Art and Frick Art Reference Library, among many others.\n\nTools and features\n\nArtstor users have the ability to search, organize, present, upload, and share images. In addition to keyword and advanced searching, users may browse works by geography, classification, or collection name. Users can zoom in on high-resolution images in the image viewer and review related information in image data records. They can also export images for use in classroom presentations and other non-commercial, educational uses, either as JPEGs, or presentations for PowerPoint 2007. Artstor has also developed the Offline Image Viewer (OIV), an alternative tool for giving offline classroom presentations. OIV allows users to download much larger images from Artstor, combine Artstor images with their own content to create digital slide show presentations that feature side-by-side comparisons, zooming and panning, and the ability to customize text on the slides. OIV enables instructors to give reliable classroom presentations using both high-resolution Artstor images and local content without being connected to the Internet. The Artstor Digital Library is accessible through Apple iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android-powered devices, providing read-only features such as searching and browsing, zooming, and viewing saved image groups.\n\nArtstor also provides Shared Shelf, a Web-based cataloging and digital media management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections. Shared Shelf was launched in 2011. Artstor worked with ten institutional partners to develop this service: Bard College, Colby College, Cornell University, Harvard University, Middlebury College, New York University, Society of Architectural Historians, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Miami, and Yale University.\n\nAs part of Artstor's mission of using digital technologies to further education, scholarship, and research worldwide, the organization collaborates with other institutions in the community to offer a number of services, many of them free.\n\nDigital Public Library of America (DPLA)\n\nThrough a collaboration with Artstor, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is providing free access to more than 10,000 high-quality images and data records from six leading museums: the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Samuel H. Kress Collection at the National Gallery of Art, the Walters Art Museum, the Yale Center for British Art and the Yale University Art Gallery.\n\nImages for Academic Publishing (IAP)\n\nArtstor’s Images for Academic Publishing (IAP) program makes available publication-quality images for use in scholarly publications free of charge. The IAP program was initiated by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2007 and is now available as an optional service to all museums who contribute images to the Artstor Digital Library. Scholars can access these images through the Artstor Digital Library at subscribing institutions or can request free access to IAP by contacting Artstor.\n\nCurrent IAP contributors include Frank Cancian (University of California, Irvine) (forthcoming), Dallas Museum of Art, Getty Research Institute, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Mellink Archive (Bryn Mawr College), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Northwestern University Library, Princeton University Art Museum (forthcoming), the Walters Art Museum, and the Yale University Art Gallery.\n\nBuilt Works Registry (BWR)\n\nArtstor and the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University are collaborating on the creation of the Built Works Registry (BWR), a community-generated data resource for architectural works and the built environment. The BWR’s goal is to create the system and tools to enable the gathering and widespread dissemination of a large and growing body of built works information. It will serve scholars, students, educators, librarians, and catalogers from academic and cultural heritage organizations worldwide, and will be openly accessible to the general public. The project is supported by a three-year National Leadership grant awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).\n\nThe Getty Research Institute (GRI), nine other institutions, and an international advisory board will also participate throughout the three-year project development cycle.

{"id": "1970631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970631", "title": "Infante Carlos, Count of Molina", "text": "Infante Carlos, Count of Molina\n\nCarlos de Borbón (29 March 178810 March 1855) was an Infante of Spain and the second surviving son of King Charles IV of Spain and of his wife, Maria Luisa of Parma. As Charles V, he was the first of the Carlist claimants to the throne of Spain. He is often referred to simply as 'Don Carlos'. He was a reactionary who stridently opposed liberalism in Spain and the assaults on the Catholic Church. He claimed the throne of Spain after the death of his older brother King Ferdinand VII in 1833. His claim was contested by liberal forces loyal to the dead king's infant daughter. The result was the bloody First Carlist War (1833–1840). Don Carlos had support from Basque provinces and much of Catalonia, but lost the war and never became king. His heirs continued the arch-conservative cause, fought two more Carlist wars and were active into the mid-20th century, but never obtained the throne.\n\nCarlos was born on 29 March 1788 at the Palacio Real de Aranjuez in Aranjuez, Community of Madrid. In 1808, Napoleon captured Madrid in the Battle of Somosierra, and he induced Carlos's father Charles IV and Carlos' older brother Ferdinand VII to renounce their rights to the throne of Spain. But Carlos, who was heir presumptive to his brother, refused to renounce his rights to the throne, which he considered to have been given to him by God. From 1808 until 1814, he and his brothers were prisoners of Napoleon at the palace of Valençay in France.\n\nIn 1814, Carlos and the rest of the Spanish royal family returned to Madrid. In September 1816, he married his niece Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal (1800–1834), daughter of King John VI of Portugal and Carlos' sister Carlota Joaquina. Francisca was also sister of the second wife of Carlos' brother, Ferdinand VII. The couple had three sons:\n\n\nApart from several formal offices, Carlos took no significant part in the government of Spain. Ferdinand VII had found it necessary to cooperate with the moderate liberals and to sign a Constitution. Carlos, however, was known for his firm belief in the divine right of kings to govern absolutely, the rigid orthodoxy of his religious opinions, and the piety of his life.\n\nDuring the revolutionary troubles of 1820–1823 (the \"liberal triennium\"), Carlos was threatened by the extreme radicals, but no attack was made on him. While there were certain conservatives in Spain who wanted to put Carlos on the throne immediately, Carlos himself was a firm believer in the legitimate succession and would never have taken up arms against his brother.\n\nIn May 1830, Ferdinand VII published the Pragmatic Sanction, again allowing daughters to succeed to the Spanish throne as well as sons. This decree had originally been approved by the Cortes in 1789, but it had never been officially promulgated. On 10 October 1830, Ferdinand's wife gave birth to a daughter Isabella, who thereupon displaced her uncle in the line of succession.\n\nThe clerical party (called in Spanish 'apostólicos') continued to support the rights of Carlos to the throne. They considered the Pragmatic Sanction not only impractical but also illegal. They intrigued in favour of Carlos, but he himself would do no more than assert his rights in words. His wife and her sister, Maria Teresa (1793–1874), the princess of Beira, on the other hand, were actively engaged in intrigues with the apostólicos.\n\nIn March 1833, Ferdinand 'authorised' Carlos to go to Portugal with his wife and sister-in-law. The 'authorisation' was in fact an order to remove Carlos and his adherents from Spain.\n\nIn April 1833, Ferdinand called upon Carlos to take an oath of allegiance to Isabella as Princess of Asturias, the title traditionally used by the first in line to the throne. In respectful but firm terms, Carlos refused. He had no personal desire for the throne, but he was adamant that he could not renounce what he considered to be his God-given rights and responsibilities.\n\nFerdinand VII died on 29 September 1833. In Madrid, his widow declared herself regent for their daughter. On 1 October, Carlos issued a manifesto declaring his own accession to the throne. He informed the members of Maria Cristina's government that they were confirmed in their posts, and proceeded to the Portuguese-Spanish border. There, he was met by forces loyal to Maria Cristina and Isabella, who threatened to arrest him. Carlos remained in Portugal, which itself was in a state of civil war between the adherents of Carlos' nephew and brother-in-law Miguel and his grand-niece, Miguel's niece Maria II. In Spain, there were various risings which developed into the First Carlist War.\n\nWhen the Miguelist party was finally beaten in Portugal in 1834, Carlos escaped to England, where the government offered to grant him an annual pension of 30,000 pounds if he would renounce his claims and never return to Spain or Portugal. Carlos refused absolutely. In July, he passed over to France, where he was actively aided by the legitimist party. He soon joined his adherents at Elizondo in the western Pyrenees of Spain. In October 1834, his sister-in-law Cristina issued a decree depriving him of his rights as an Infante of Spain; this was confirmed by the Cortes in 1837.\n\nCarlos remained in Spain for five years. During these years, he accompanied his armies, without displaying any of the qualities of a general or even much personal courage. But he endured a good deal of hardship, and was often compelled to take to hiding in the hills. On these occasions, he was often carried over difficult places on the back of a stout guide commonly known as the \"royal jackass\" (\"burro real\").\n\nThe semblance of a court which Carlos maintained was torn by incessant personal intrigues. While some of his adherents supported him because they believed in his hereditary rights to the throne, others were more concerned to preserve home rule in the Basque districts. There were ongoing conflicts between Carlos' military staff and the clergy who exercised significant influence over him.\n\nIn the first few years of the war, there were several moments when victory was within Carlos' grasp. The last of these was the so-called Royal Expedition of the summer of 1837, when Carlos himself accompanied his army from Navarre to the outskirts of Madrid. Carlos hoped to enter the city without any significant bloodshed, but when it became clear that only a battle would win the city, Carlos vacillated. After several days, Carlos himself decided to withdraw; his army melted away and was reduced to a third of its former strength.\n\nHis first wife having died in England in 1834, Carlos married her elder sister, his own niece Maria Teresa of Portugal, Princess of Beira in Biscay in October 1837.\n\nIn June 1838, Carlos appointed Rafael Maroto as his commander-in-chief. In February 1839, Maroto had four Carlist generals shot and issued a proclamation criticizing Carlos' court. When Carlos removed him from office, Maroto marched to Tolosa where Carlos was living and made him a virtual prisoner. Maroto was re-appointed commander-in-chief, and his opponents in Carlos' court were dismissed. Maroto then began private negotiations with Cristina's commander-in-chief, and in August 1839 abandoned Carlos completely.\n\nIn September 1839, Carlos left Spain for France, where he was briefly imprisoned. For almost another year, some of his commanders continued to fight on his behalf, especially in Catalonia. However, by July 1840, almost all resistance was concluded.\n\nIn May 1845, Carlos renounced his rights to the throne of Spain in favour of his eldest son, Carlos Luis. Subsequently, he used the title 'count of Molina'. On 10 March 1855, he died at Trieste (then in the Austrian Empire), where he is buried in the chapel of Saint Charles Borromeo in the cathedral of San Giusto.\n\nIn midst of the first Carlist War, on 15 January 1837, the Cortes passed a law, ratified by royal decree of Regent María Cristina, which excluded Don Carlos and several of his named allies from the succession to the Spanish crown and declared them stripped of their Spanish titles. These were: Carlos himself, his descendants, his ally and future wife Teresa of Portugal, Teresa's son Sebastian (1811–1875), and Carlos's nephew Miguel I of Portugal (1802–1866), the other absolutist rival monarch in another country. They were so deprived as \"rebels\".\n\n\n"}

The film's initial German title was Der ewige Jude, the German term for the character of the \"Wandering Jew\" in medieval folklore. The film was directed by Fritz Hippler at the insistence of Nazi Germany's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. \n\nWith a screenplay credited to Eberhard Taubert and narrated by Harry Giese, the film consists of feature and documentary footage combined with materials filmed shortly after the Nazi occupation of Poland. At this time, Poland's Jewish population was about three million, roughly ten percent of the total population.\n\nHitler and Goebbels believed that film was a vital tool for molding public opinion. The Nazis first established a film department in 1930 and Goebbels had taken a personal interest in the use of film to promote the Nazi philosophy and agenda. Soon after the Nazi takeover, Goebbels insisted in speeches that the role of the German cinema was to serve as the \"vanguard of the Nazi military\".\n\nThe Goebbels film appears to have been intended as a violently antisemitic version of the British film \"The Wandering Jew\", which argued that Jews were victims of relentless persecution throughout history. Saul Friedländer suggests that Goebbels' intent was to counter three films: \"Jew Süss\", \"The House of Rothschild\", and \"The Wandering Jew\". These three films, all released in 1933–34, showed that Jews were persecuted throughout history; the Goebbels films presented the opposite message.\n\nIn 1937, a special wing of the Propaganda Ministry put on an art exhibition in Munich titled \"Der ewige Jude\". It followed this up with the publication of a book of the same title, consisting of 265 photographs, each with a derogatory caption asserting the degeneracy of the Jewish race.\n\nIn November 1938, Goebbels made a series of attacks against the Jews in the German media that were a factor which resulted in the pogrom known as Kristallnacht. Despite the emotional satisfaction afforded the Nazis by carrying out their antisemitism with direct violence, Kristallnacht was considered by Hitler to have been a political disaster both within Germany and internationally. Not only did the brutality indirectly caused by Goebbels evoke harsh criticism internationally, the mixed reaction in the German media showed a lack of broad-based support among Germans for antisemitism and violence.\n\nHitler expressed his frustration and anger at the mixed response from the German media and insisted that, instead of openly calling for violence against the Jews as Goebbels had in instigating the pogrom, Nazi propaganda should \"elucidate events of foreign policy\" in such a way that the German people themselves would call for violence against the Jews.\n\nIn response to Hitler's harsh reprimand, Goebbels launched a campaign to promote the antisemitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. In the case of \"The Eternal Jew\", Goebbels conceived of a film that would communicate to the German people the same antisemitic message that had been the theme of the 1937 Munich exhibition. Hitler preferred films such as \"The Eternal Jew\" which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straightforward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal. The film \"Jud Süß\" is an example of Goebbels' preferred approach.\n\nAlthough Goebbels did not generally take an active role in the production of particular films, he elected to do so in the case of major propaganda films such as \"The Eternal Jew\". The film was in production for over a year. Throughout the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, Goebbels devoted \"constant attention\" to the production of what he referred to as \"the Jew film\".\nAs early as 1938, Goebbels had wanted to have a film crew travel to Poland to shoot the ghetto scenes; however, he was unable to gain permission from the Polish government. In October and November 1939, almost immediately after the German/Soviet invasion of Poland, he instructed Hippler to send camera crews to Łódź, Warsaw, Cracow and Lublin to shoot footage of Polish Jews. \n\nThe footage that Hippler shot in the Jewish ghettos of those cities in German occupied Poland was the only footage shot specifically for the purpose of the film. At the beginning of the film, animated text informs the audience that this \"documentary footage\" shows Jews in their original state \"before they put on the mask of civilized Europeans.\" In the Nazi press, Hippler expanded on this claim, asserting that his filming techniques captured Jews \"in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings.\"\n\nAlthough Hippler advertised the film as being a factual documentary consisting of pictures of real Jews with nothing faked or simulated, his claims were complete falsehoods. In reality, the film was an exercise in manipulation for the purposes of propaganda. In shooting his footage, Hippler did in fact simulate scenes and use actors who were performing under duress and without knowledge of how the footage would be employed. For example, in order to get shots of Jewish worship services, Hippler and Goebbels assembled the congregation of the Vilker synagogue, ordered them to wear the \"tallithim\" and \"tefillin\" and hold a full-scale service. When the Germans ordered the Torah reader to read from the Torah, he started by saying on camera \"Today is Tuesday\" signalling that his reading of the Torah was coerced since it was not customary to read the Torah on Tuesdays.\n\nAside from the footage shot in Poland, the rest of the film consisted of stills and archival footage from feature films (often without permission) that the film presented as if they were documentary footage.\n\nThe movie was produced in a documentary format and, like other Hippler films, relied heavily on narration.\n\nThe film can be roughly divided into four thematic areas:\n\nRichard Barsam writes the film's \"essential contrast is between myths and stereotypes of Jews and the Nazi ideal of a 'master race,' between the alleged inferiority of the Jews and the superiority of the Germans.\" According to Stephen Fritz, Goebbels' intent was to create a film that would serve as \"both a demonstration of the parasitical nature of the Jews and a justification for drastic measures against them.\" Maria Tatar writes that the Nazis were able to use Hippler's film to \"position the victims of their genocidal project as dangerous aggressors who had to be exterminated.\" Similarly, Barsam describes the film as arguing that \"Jews are criminals;... they have no soul;... they are different in every way;... killing them is not a crime, but a necessity—just as killing rats is a necessity to preserve health and cleanliness.\"\n\n\"Unser Wille und Weg\" (Our Will and Way), a Nazi Party monthly publication aimed at propagandists, provides a rationale for why \"The Eternal Jew\" was made. The author of the essay \"The Film of a 2000-Year Rat Migration,\" who remains anonymous, believes the film shows \"a full picture of Jewry\" and provides \"the best treatment of this parasitic race.\" The author connects the Jews' migration from the Middle East to Egypt and their following of German colonists to rats traveling as a group, who \"even then displayed the same criminal traits that they still displayed\". The film is complimented for \"its portrayal of the Jews' vulgar methods and the brutality and all-devouring hatred they exhibit when they reach their goal and control finance.\" The slaughtering method causes the author to question the \"so-called Jewish religion\", as butchers do their work with grins on their face. In closing, the author states the film will be a valuable tool in the struggle to break the Jews' \"power over us. We are the initiators of the fight against world Jewry, which now directs its hate, its brutal greed and destructive will toward us. We must win this battle for ourselves, for Europe, for the world.\"\n\nRichard Taylor describes the basic tenet of the film as arguing that \"the Jew is an oriental barbarian who has insinuated himself cleverly into European society, and now exploits it parasitically.\" This point is emphasized throughout the film, starting from the very opening lines of the film's commentary:\nThe \"civilized\" Jews that we know in Germany give us only an incomplete picture of their racial character. This film shows genuine shots of the Polish ghettos. It shows the Jews as they really are, before they conceal themselves behind the mask of the civilized European.\nFollowing this commentary, the film provides a succession of scenes in which Jews are portrayed as an uncivilized, parasitic people with low social standing. The images were mostly shot on site in the Warsaw Ghetto and other Polish ghettos, showing subjects who were deliberately chosen to be poorly dressed, dirty and who had partially toothless grins. The locations shown are dirty and infested by vermin. Robert Reimer asserts that a central theme of the film is the assertion that \"Jews have always lived in the ghettos and in fact they \"choose\" to live this way.\" According to Reimer, the film asserts that ghettos are \"ordinary [and] normal\" aspects of Jewish life. Reimer charges that what the film is actually showing is not the normal life of Polish Jewry but rather the \"effect of the Nazi administration and the disruption of the lives of millions of Polish Jews.\" Erik Barnouw describes the Warsaw Ghetto after the Nazi conquest as a place where \"hundreds of thousands of Jews were herded by the Nazi conquerors into pockets of indescribable misery.\" He describes footage shot there as showing \"half-starved, unshaven creatures caught in pathetic acts of barter – a pair of socks for a scrap of food.\" It is scenes such as these that the film presents as showing Jews \"in their natural state.\"\n\nThe film utilizes a montage that juxtaposes these images of ghetto Jews with images of rats to draw an analogy between the migration of Jews from Eastern Europe with the migration of rats. For example, one of the shots shows a pack of rats emerging from a sewer, followed by a shot of a crowd of Jews in a bustling street of the Łódź Ghetto. Close-ups of those in the crowd reveal sickly, malformed facial features. The narrator states that, as rats are the vermin of the animal kingdom, Jews are the vermin of the human race and similarly spread disease and corruption. Unlike rats, however, the narrator continues, Jews have the uncanny ability to change their appearance and blend into their \"human hosts.\" A scene depicts four bearded men in traditional religious Jewish clothing, then shows them shaved and in modern business suits, while the narrator explains that only a \"trained eye\" can distinguish their Jewish features.\n\"Where rats appear, they bring ruin by destroying mankind's goods and foodstuffs. In this way, they spread disease, plague, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and so on. They are cunning, cowardly and cruel and are found mostly in large packs. Among the animals, they represent the rudiment of an insidious, underground destruction – just like the Jews among human beings.\"\nThe film also claims that:\n\n[Jewish people] need other people because they need the goods with which to carry on business. The things that are valued by the creative \"Aryan\" peoples have been reduced by the Jew to the level of a mere piece of merchandise, which he buys and sells but cannot produce himself. He leaves production to the labourers and peasants of the people upon whom he has imposed his presence. The Jews are a race without farmers and without manual labourers, a race of parasites.\n\nAccording to \"Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany\":\nBy showing the way in which Jews allegedly insinuate themselves from small-scale to large-scale operations by preying on others, the film returns to its original image of the Jew concealing himself 'behind the mask of the civilised European'. [...] According to the film, the Jew presents an insidious, because concealed, threat, and one that is growing and must be brought under control. The message of this part of the commentary is that Jews will always be Jews, and that the 'civilised European' Jew is only a guise for a new and more dangerous forms of parasitic exploitation.\n\nThe film also claims that the Jewish people ... \n...change their outward appearances when they leave their Polish nests and go out into the rich world. [...] When he appears without them, then it is only the keen-eyed amongst us who recognise his racial origins. [...] It is true that their fathers and grandfathers still lived in ghettoes, but there is no trace left now in their external appearance. Here in the second and third generation, the Aryanisation has reached its zenith. [...] And people lacking in intuition allow themselves to be deceived by this mimicry and regard them as being in truth their equals. Therein lies the dreadful danger, for even these 'civilised' Jews remain foreign bodies in the organism of their hosts, no matter how much their outward appearance may correspond to that of their hosts.\n\nThe film claims:\n\"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews sit at the junction of the world financial markets. They are an international power. Only one percent of the world's population, with the help of their capital they terrorize the world stock exchanges, world opinion, and world politics.\"\nThe movie blamed Jews for inflation and unemployment in Germany. It charged that they had crept into all professions through usury, racketeering and crimes against German assets.\n\"Out of a thousand workers in Berlin, only two were Jews. For the start of 1933, out of one hundred prosecutors in Berlin 15 were Jews. Out of a hundred judges were 23 Jews. Out of a hundred lawyers 49 Jews. 52 Jews out of a hundred doctors. And out of every hundred of businessmen 60 Jews. The average wealth of Germans was 810 marks each. The average wealth of each Jew amounted to 10,000 marks.\"\nThe evidence for these assertions is unstated in the film. The occupational information is found in Germany's June 1933 census, which proves the claims made in the movie to be greatly exaggerated.\n\nIn 1933, 5,600 Jewish doctors and 3,030 Jewish lawyers were practicing in Germany, corresponding to 11 percent of doctors and 16 percent of lawyers. Still, an exceptionally large number of successful lawsuits over equal citizenship and rights had been filed in the Weimar Republic, most of them by Jewish lawyers. The Nuremberg Laws specifically forbade German judges from citing any precedents by Jewish jurists and cut off Jewish doctors from reimbursement under public health care insurance.\n\nIn contrast, during the economic crisis between the end of World War I and the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were disproportionately likely to be laid off from the labor market, to the point that 1 out of every 4 Jews had been laid off by 1935. The original set of layoffs also had the effect of concentrating Jewish employment during this period into the professional and self-employed sectors, while post-1933 delicensing and other Nuremberg legislation gradually pushed Jews completely out of professional occupations and into positions such as street peddlers.\n\nThe reference to average wealth probably used the wealth of the Jewish Rothschild family as the basis for its calculation. The Rothschild banking family is still believed to have had the largest private fortune in the world during the 19th century, as well as the largest fortune in modern world history. Although the Creditanstalt debts were assumed in part by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, its bankruptcy was later used by Hitler as an example of how the Jews were responsible for all the economic and social troubles of Germany and the world.\n\nThe movie goes on to assert that: \"The most common expressions in the jargon of international gangsters and criminals stem from Hebrew and Yiddish words.\" According to the movie, Jews are likewise disproportionately plentiful in organized crime, where they represent 82% of international crime organizations, and 98% of international prostitution. This Jewish influence is seen as well in the international language used by criminals (see also \"Rotwelsch\"). The evidence for these blatant assertions is nowhere produced. Insofar as \"organized crime\" represents lawbreaking other than that forced by the Nuremberg Laws, it has not been corroborated by subsequent research.\n\nThe film also claims that the Jewish people have some kind of \"genetic predisposition towards barter and haggling\", saying that \"[Jewish people] rush into trade\" because it is fitting \"with their character and inclination\", and that \"For the Jew, there is but one object of value – money. How he earns it is a matter of complete indifference to him.\" It also accuses Jews of passing corruption on to their children by religious means, saying that:\n\nThese children see no ideals before them like our own. The egoism of the individual is not used in the service of higher common goals. On the contrary, Jewish racial morality claims, in contrast to \"Aryan\" morality, that the unrestrained egoism of each Jew is a divine law. His religion makes a duty out of treachery and usury.\n\nIn a long sequence of images, the film provides examples to illustrate its claims that Aryan/European culture had been corrupted by Jews.\nThis sequence includes footage of notable figures who had earned Adolf Hitler's wrath, such as physicist and Nobel laureate Albert Einstein and Spartacist uprising leader Rosa Luxemburg (erroneously named as one and the same person as anarchist Emma Goldman) as representatives of so-called \"international Jewry\". Einstein's image was juxtaposed with a series of images about the supposed Jewish control of the pornography industry. Einstein was characterized as \"the relativity Jew, who masks his hatred of Germany behind his obscure pseudo-sciences\".\nOther film clips presented Jewish (or supposedly Jewish) actors from the Weimar era such as Curt Bois, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Ernst Lubitsch. Charlie Chaplin was also included in this sequence and inaccurately identified as Jewish, possibly as a consequence of his role as the Jewish barber in \"The Great Dictator\".\n\nThe film includes two scenes from the Hollywood film \"The House of Rothschild\" (1934). The first clip shows Mayer Rothschild, a rich man, hiding money and putting on old, shabby clothes in order to fool a corrupt tax collector. And the second shows him speaking to his sons, encouraging them to start an international banking business to take advantage of nations' misfortunes in times of war. The clips were used without permission.\n\nThe film's narrator asserts that: \"the Jew is instinctively interested in everything abnormal and depraved.\" To illustrate this point, Hippler included a scene from Fritz Lang's film \"M\" in which the child murderer Beckert (played by Peter Lorre) makes an impassioned plea to the \"jury\" of criminals, begging for his life and disclaiming responsibility for his crimes on account of insanity. Beckert shrieks, \"... it burns within me. I must go the way I am driven. Who knows what is going on inside me? How I must – not want, must!\" According to Sharon Packer, Hitler used this scene to assert that \"Jews transmit inheritable criminality and therefore deserve to die.\"\n\nThe film proceeds to suggest that pictorial art and music have degenerated under Jewish influence, with many spurious examples given. Degenerate art included works of abstract art as well as those from specific individuals such as George Grosz and Emil Nolde, while degenerate music included jazz and so-called \"Negermusik\", although here the connection to Jewry is absent.\n\nAfter showing how Jews have supposedly been responsible for the decline of Western music, science, art, and commerce, the film presents a scene of a cow being slaughtered for meat by a \"shochet\" (Jewish ritual slaughterer). The scene is prefaced by a warning similar to the one in \"Frankenstein\", warning the squeamish about what is coming next. This long sequence, lasting several minutes, shows cows and sheep in their death throes as they bleed to death. The producers apparently filmed this scene because of Hitler's opposition to cruelty to animals. He had banned kosher slaughter of animals in Germany and felt that such footage would shock the German public.\n\nThis scene was cut from the version intended for young audiences.\n\nThe film concludes with footage of Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech in which he proclaims:\n\n\"If international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, the result will not be Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!\"\nThe film ends with images of brownshirted SA troops on parade.\n\nIn and of itself, the movie did not have much impact on the German public. The film suffered from being released after \"Jud Süß\", which had been wildly popular, perhaps because the antisemitic message was secondary to an engaging period drama. The actors in \"Jud Süß\" were leading German actors of the time. In contrast, \"Der ewige Jude\" only original footage was of Jews in the Polish ghetto and animated maps. All the other footage consisted of stills and archive film clips.\n\nThus, unlike \"Jud Süß\", which was a box-office smash success, \"Der ewige Jude\" was a commercial flop. David Culbert asserts that it is unlikely that there were more than one million paid admissions compared to over 20 million paid admissions to \"Jud Süß\". The film was more known by word-of-mouth descriptions than from people actually viewing it. Some Germans were quoted as saying \"We've already seen enough Jewish filth. We don't need to see any more.\"\n\nThe film was chiefly screened by party supporters and Nazi organizations like the Hitler Youth and the SS. Its themes and content made it a topic of discussion by a wider audience that never saw it. Himmler invited to screen it for SS troops headed for the Eastern Front to carry out the \"Final Solution\".\n\nIn 1946, Fritz Hippler was tried for directing \"Der ewige Jude\" but was not found guilty. Hippler contended Joseph Goebbels was the true creator of \"The Eternal Jew\" with Hitler's close supervision. He claimed that Goebbels gave Hippler credit as a reward \"for his excellent work in the newsreel department\".\n\nFranz Hippler was interviewed in the Emmy Award-winning program \"The Propaganda Battle\" in the PBS series \"Walk Through the Twentieth Century\" (1983–1984). In this interview he stated that he regretted being listed as the director of \"The Eternal Jew\" because it resulted in being interrogated by the Allies after the war. He thought this was unfair because, in his opinion, he had nothing to do with the killing of Jews. In an interview shown in the German documentary series \"Holocaust\" (2000), the 90-year-old Hippler described the film as \"the most disgraceful example of antisemitism.\" The film's narrator, Harry Giese, went on to narrate other films, but he was associated with this film and other films by the Third Reich and he found less work in the Postwar German cinema of the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe public distribution and exhibition of the film is prohibited in Germany. The only exception is for use in college classrooms and other academic purposes; however, exhibitors must have formal education in \"media science and the history of the Holocaust\", and it can only be screened in a censored version with annotations.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Among the activities the organization is involved in is educating Russian civil society on the rule of law in relation to service in the military, as well as informing society about what the armed forces should look like in a democratic society. The organization also provides free legal advice to soldiers and their families about their rights and conscription laws, as well as intervening on behalf of soldiers who are facing abuse and hazing from their superiors and other more senior soldiers (\"dedovshchina\").\n\nIn August 2014 one of the members of the organisation stated that 100 wounded Russian soldiers who might have been injured fighting in Ukraine were taken to hospitals in Saint Petersburg. The Russian government labelled the organisation a \"foreign agent\", a move which members of the organization see as retaliation on the part of the authorities. According to \"The Moscow Times\" some considered this labeling of the group as punishment for their statements. The organization has not received any funding from foreign (non-Russian sources) since May 2014. On 18 October 2014, Russian police detained the head of local Committee of Soldiers' Mothers in Budennovsk, (73-year-old) Lyudmila Bogatenkova, on suspicion of fraud; the local Committee of Soldiers' Mothers in Saint Petersburg labelled this arrest \"an act of intimidation in connection with her activities\".\n\nThe Committee was awarded the Rafto Prize in 1995 and the Right Livelihood Award in 1996.\n\n"}
{"id": "1970676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970676", "title": "Crax", "text": "Crax\n\nCrax is a genus of curassows in the order Galliformes, a clade of large, heavy-bodied, ground-feeding birds. They are known from tropical South America with one species, the great curassow, ranging northwards through Central America as far as Mexico. The curassows in this genus are noted for their sexual dimorphism; males are more boldly coloured than females and have facial ornamentation such as knobs and wattles. They are also characterised by curly crests and contrastingly-coloured crissums (the area around the cloaca). \"Crax\" curassows probably originated as a distinct lineage during the Late Miocene. During the Messinian, the ancestral Crax split into two lineages separated by the Colombian Andes and the Cordillera de Mérida which uplifted at that time. The northern lineage radiated into the great, blue-billed, and yellow-knobbed curassows, while the four southern species evolved as they became separated by the uplifting of various mountain ranges.\n\nThe variety of male bill ornament shapes and colors is typical for this genus, as is a curly crest and a contrasting white or rufous crissum. \"Crax\" species, even distantly related, readily hybridize, with fertile offspring theoretically possible in all possible mating combinations\n\nSpecies are:\nThis genus forms one of the two major lineages of curassows. It is distinguishable from its relatives by its pronounced sexual dimorphism (with the exception of the black curassow). In other genera sexual dimorphism is rarely exhibited or of minor appearance (\"Nothocrax\" and \"Pauxi\"), or manifest by size only (\"Mitu\").\n\n\"Crax\" curassows probably originated as a distinct lineage during the Tortonian (Late Miocene), some 10-9 mya, in the western or northwestern Amazonas basin, as indicated by mt and nDNA sequence data calibrated against geological events (Pereira & Baker 2004, Pereira \"et al.\" 2002). Some 6 mya during the Messinian, the ancestral \"Crax\" split into two lineages which are separated by the Colombian Andes and the Cordillera de Mérida which were uplifted around that time, and the Orinoco which consequently assumed its present-day basin.\n\nThe northern lineage quite soon thereafter radiated into the ancestors of the great, blue-billed, and yellow-knobbed curassows, which were isolated from each other by the uplift of the northern Cordillera Occidental, and the Serranía del Perijá, respectively; it is fairly certain that these lineages were well distinct by the end of the Miocene. (Pereira & Baker 2004)\n\nThe evolution of the 4 southern species was somewhat more complex. In the Messinian, about 6–5.5 mya, the ancestors of the wattled curassow became isolated in the western Amazonas basin. With increasing aridification of southeastern Brazil, the ancestors of the red-billed curassow found refuge in the mountain ranges between the Brazilian Highlands and the Atlantic during the mid-Zanclean, some 4.5-4 mya. The divergence between the bare-faced and black curassow lineages apparently took place around the Uquian–Ensenadan boundary, some 1.5 mya. This which coincides with one or several period(s) of elevated sea levels during which the lower Amazonas basin was a brackish lagoon which offered little curassow habitat. Their present ranges are consequently still separated by the Amazonas river. (Pereira & Baker 2004)\n\n"}

{"id": "1970691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970691", "title": "Aptamer", "text": "Aptamer\n\nAptamers (from the Latin \"aptus\" – fit, and Greek \"meros\" – part) are oligonucleotide or peptide molecules that bind to a specific target molecule. Aptamers are usually created by selecting them from a large random sequence pool, but natural aptamers also exist in riboswitches. Aptamers can be used for both basic research and clinical purposes as macromolecular drugs. Aptamers can be combined with ribozymes to self-cleave in the presence of their target molecule. These compound molecules have additional research, industrial and clinical applications.\n\nMore specifically, aptamers can be classified as\n\n\nNucleic acid aptamers are nucleic acid species (\"next-gen antibody mimics\") having selectivity at par of antibodies for a given target generated via in-vitro selection or equivalently, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) ranging from small entities such as heavy metal ions to large entities like cells. On the molecular level, aptamers bind to its cognate target through various non-covalent interactions viz., electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and induced fitting. Aptamers are useful in biotechnological and therapeutic applications as they offer molecular recognition properties that rival that of the commonly used biomolecule, antibodies. In addition to their discriminate recognition, aptamers offer advantages over antibodies as they can be engineered completely in a test tube, are readily produced by chemical synthesis, possess desirable storage properties, and elicit little or no immunogenicity in therapeutic applications .\n\nIn 1990, two labs independently developed the technique of selection: the Gold lab, using the term SELEX for their process of selecting RNA ligands against T4 DNA polymerase; and the Szostak lab, coining the term \"in vitro selection\", selecting RNA ligands against various organic dyes. The Szostak lab also coined the term aptamer (from the Latin, \"apto\", meaning 'to fit') for these nucleic acid-based ligands. Two years later, the Szostak lab and Gilead Sciences, independent of one another, used \"in vitro selection\" schemes to evolve single stranded DNA ligands for organic dyes and human coagulant, thrombin (see anti-thrombin aptamers), respectively. There does not appear to be any systematic differences between RNA and DNA aptamers, save the greater intrinsic chemical stability of DNA.\n\nThe notion of selection \"in vitro\" was preceded twenty-plus years prior when Sol Spiegelman used a Qbeta replication system as a way to evolve a self-replicating molecule. In addition, a year before the publishing of \"in vitro selection\" and SELEX, Gerald Joyce used a system that he termed 'directed evolution' to alter the cleavage activity of a ribozyme.\n\nSince the discovery of aptamers, many researchers have used aptamer selection as a means for application and discovery. In 2001, the process of \"in vitro selection\" was automated by J. Colin Cox in the Ellington lab at the University of Texas at Austin, reducing the duration of a selection experiment from six weeks to three days.\n\nWhile the process of artificial engineering of nucleic acid ligands is highly interesting to biology and biotechnology, the notion of aptamers in the natural world had yet to be uncovered until 2002 when two groups led by Ronald Breaker and Evgeny Nudler discovered a nucleic acid-based genetic regulatory element (which was named riboswitch) that possesses similar molecular recognition properties to the artificially made aptamers. In addition to the discovery of a new mode of genetic regulation, this adds further credence to the notion of an 'RNA World', a postulated stage in time in the origins of life on Earth.\n\nBoth DNA and RNA aptamers show robust binding affinities for various targets. DNA and RNA aptamers have been selected for the same target. These targets include lysozyme, thrombin, human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting responsive element (HIV TAR), hemin, interferon γ, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prostate specific antigen (PSA), dopamine, and the non-classical oncogene, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). In the case of lysozyme, HIV TAR, VEGF and dopamine the DNA aptamer is the analog of the RNA aptamer, with thymine replacing uracil. The hemin, thrombin, and interferon γ, DNA and RNA aptamers were selected through independent selections and have unique sequences. Considering that not all DNA analogs of RNA aptamers show functionality, the correlation between DNA and RNA sequence and their structure and function requires further investigation.\n\nLately, a concept of smart aptamers, and smart ligands in general, has been introduced. It describes aptamers that are selected with pre-defined equilibrium , rate constants and thermodynamic (ΔH, ΔS) parameters of aptamer-target interaction. Kinetic capillary electrophoresis is the technology used for the selection of smart aptamers. It obtains aptamers in a few rounds of selection.\n\nRecent developments in aptamer-based therapeutics have been rewarded in the form of the first aptamer-based drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), called Macugen offered by OSI Pharmaceuticals. In addition, the company NeoVentures Biotechnology Inc. has successfully commercialized the first aptamer based diagnostic platform for analysis of mycotoxins in grain. Many contract companies develop aptamers and aptabodies to replace antibodies in research, diagnostic platforms, drug discovery, and therapeutics.\n\nNon-modified aptamers are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream, with a half-life of minutes to hours, mainly due to nuclease degradation and clearance from the body by the kidneys, a result of the aptamer's inherently low molecular weight. Unmodified aptamer applications currently focus on treating transient conditions such as blood clotting, or treating organs such as the eye where local delivery is possible. This rapid clearance can be an advantage in applications such as \"in vivo\" diagnostic imaging. An example is a tenascin-binding aptamer under development by Schering AG for cancer imaging. Several modifications, such as 2'-fluorine-substituted pyrimidines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkage, etc. (both of which are used in Macugen, an FDA-approved aptamer) are available to scientists with which to increase the serum half-life of aptamers easily to the day or even week time scale.\n\nAnother approach to increase the nuclease resistance of aptamers is to develop Spiegelmers, which are composed entirely of an unnatural L-ribonucleic acid backbone. A Spiegelmer of the same sequence has the same binding properties of the corresponding RNA aptamer, except it binds to the mirror image of its target molecule.\n\nIn addition to the development of aptamer-based therapeutics, many researchers such as the Ellington lab have been developing diagnostic techniques for aptamer based plasma protein profiling called aptamer plasma proteomics. This technology will enable future multi-biomarker protein measurements that can aid diagnostic distinction of disease versus healthy states.\n\nFurthermore, the Hirao lab applied a genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair to SELEX and achieved the generation of high affinity DNA aptamers. Only few hydrophobic unnatural base as a fifth base significantly augment the aptamer affinity to target proteins.\n\nAs a resource for all \"in vitro selection\" and SELEX experiments, the Ellington lab has developed the Aptamer Database cataloging all published experiments.\n\nPeptide aptamers are artificial proteins selected or engineered to bind specific target molecules. These proteins consist of one or more peptide loops of variable sequence displayed by a protein scaffold. They are typically isolated from combinatorial libraries and often subsequently improved by directed mutation or rounds of variable region mutagenesis and selection. \"In vivo\", peptide aptamers can bind cellular protein targets and exert biological effects, including interference with the normal protein interactions of their targeted molecules with other proteins. Libraries of peptide aptamers have been used as \"mutagens\", in studies in which an investigator introduces a library that expresses different peptide aptamers into a cell population, selects for a desired phenotype, and identifies those aptamers that cause the phenotype. The investigator then uses those aptamers as baits, for example in yeast two-hybrid screens to identify the cellular proteins targeted by those aptamers. Such experiments identify particular proteins bound by the aptamers, and protein interactions that the aptamers disrupt, to cause the phenotype. In addition, peptide aptamers derivatized with appropriate functional moieties can cause specific postranslational modification of their target proteins, or change the subcellular localization of the targets.\n\nPeptide aptamers can also recognize targets \"in vitro\". They have found use in lieu of antibodies in biosensors and used to detect active isoforms of proteins from populations containing both inactive and active protein forms. Derivatives known as tadpoles, in which peptide aptamer \"heads\" are covalently linked to unique sequence double-stranded DNA \"tails\", allow quantification of scarce target molecules in mixtures by PCR (using, for example, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) of their DNA tails.\n\nThe peptides that form the aptamer variable regions are synthesized as part of the same polypeptide chain as the scaffold and are constrained at their N and C termini by linkage to it. This double structural constraint decreases the diversity of the conformations that the variable regions can adopt, and this reduction in conformational diversity lowers the entropic cost of molecular binding when interaction with the target causes the variable regions to adopt a single conformation. As a consequence, peptide aptamers can bind their targets tightly, with binding affinities comparable to those shown by antibodies (nanomolar range).\n\nPeptide aptamer scaffolds are typically small, ordered, soluble proteins. The first scaffold, which is still widely used, is Escherichia coli thioredoxin, the \"trxA\" gene product (TrxA). In these molecules, a single peptide of variable sequence is displayed instead of the Gly-Pro motif in the TrxA -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- active site loop. Improvements to TrxA include substitution of serines for the flanking cysteines, which prevents possible formation of a disulfide bond at the base of the loop, introduction of a D26A substitution to reduce oligomerization, and optimization of codons for expression in human cells. Reviews in 2015 have reported studies using 12 and 20 other scaffolds.\n\nPeptide aptamer selection can be made using different systems, but the most used is currently the yeast two-hybrid system. Peptide aptamers can also be selected from combinatorial peptide libraries constructed by phage display and other surface display technologies such as mRNA display, ribosome display, bacterial display and yeast display. These experimental procedures are also known as biopannings. Among peptides obtained from biopannings, mimotopes can be considered as a kind of peptide aptamers. All the peptides panned from combinatorial peptide libraries have been stored in a special database with the name MimoDB.\n\nSelection of Ligand Regulated Peptide Aptamers (LiRPAs) has been demonstrated. By displaying 7 amino acid peptides from a novel scaffold protein based on the trimeric FKBP-rapamycin-FRB structure, interaction between the randomized peptide and target molecule can be controlled by the small molecule Rapamycin or non-immunosuppressive analogs.\n\nThe Affimer protein, an evolution of peptide aptamers, is a small, highly stable protein engineered to display peptide loops which provides a high affinity binding surface for a specific target protein. It is a protein of low molecular weight, 12–14 kDa, derived from the cysteine protease inhibitor family of cystatins.\n\nThe Affimer scaffold is a stable protein based on the cystatin protein fold. It displays two peptide loops and an N-terminal sequence that can be randomised to bind different target proteins with high affinity and specificity similar to antibodies. Stabilisation of the peptide upon the protein scaffold constrains the possible conformations which the peptide may take, thus increasing the binding affinity and specificity compared to libraries of free peptides.\n\nThe Affimer protein scaffold was developed initially at the MRC Cancer Cell Unit in Cambridge then across two laboratories at the University of Leeds. Affimer technology has been commercialised and developed by Avacta Life Sciences, who are developing it as reagents for research and therapeutic applications.\n\nX-Aptamers are a new generation of aptamers designed to improve on the binding and versatility of regular DNA/RNA- based aptamers. X-Aptamers are engineered with a combination of natural and chemically-modified DNA or RNA nucleotides. Base modifications allow incorporation of various functional groups/small molecules into X-aptamers, opening a wide range of uses and a higher likelihood of binding success compared to standard aptamers. Thiophosphate backbone modifications at selected positions enhance nuclease stability and binding affinity without sacrificing specificity. \n\nX-Aptamers are able to explore new features by utilizing a new selection process. Unlike SELEX, X-Aptamer selection does not rely on multiple repeated rounds of PCR amplification but rather involves a two-step bead-based discovery process. In the primary selection process, combinatorial libraries are created where each bead will carry approximately 10^12 copies of a single sequence. The beads operate as carriers, where the bound sequences will ultimately be detached into solution. In the secondary solution pull-down process, each target will be used to individually pull down the binding sequences from solution. The binding sequences are amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. Sequences that are enriched for each target can then be synthesized and characterized.\n\nAptaBiD or Aptamer-Facilitated Biomarker Discovery is a technology for biomarker discovery. AptaBiD is based on multi-round generation of an aptamer or a pool of aptamers for differential molecular targets on the cells which facilitates exponential detection of biomarkers. It involves three major stages: (i) differential multi-round selection of aptamers for biomarker of target cells; (ii) aptamer-based isolation of biomarkers from target cells; and (iii) mass spectrometry identification of biomarkers. The important feature of the AptaBiD technology is that it produces synthetic affinity probes (aptamers) simultaneously with biomarker discovery. In AptaBiD, aptamers are developed for cell surface biomarkers in their native state and conformation. In addition to facilitating biomarker identification, such aptamers can be directly used for cell isolation, cell visualization, and tracking cells \"in vivo\". They can also be used to modulate activities of cell receptors and deliver different agents (e.g., siRNA and drugs) into the cells.\n\nAptamers can be used in:\n\nAptamers have also been against several pathogens both bacterial & viruses including influenza A and B viruses, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in various experimental settings.\n\nAptamers have an innate ability to bind to any molecule they're targeted at, including cancer cells and bacteria. Bound to a target, aptamers inhibit its activity. Aptamers suffer from two issues that limit their effectiveness. Firstly, the bonds they form with target molecules are usually too weak to be effective, and second, they're easily digested by enzymes.\n\nAdding an unnatural base to a standard aptamer can increase its ability bind to target molecules. A second addition in the form of a \"mini hairpin DNA\" gives the aptamer a stable and compact structure that is resistant to digestion, extending its life from hours to days.\n\nAptamers are less likely to provoke undesirable immune responses than antibodies.\n\nThe ability of aptamers to reversibly bind molecules such as proteins has generated increasing interest in using them to facilitate controlled release of therapeutic biomolecules, such as growth factors. This can be accomplished by tuning the affinity strength to passively release the growth factors, along with active release via mechanisms such as hybridization of the aptamer with complementary oligonucleotides or unfolding of the aptamer due to cellular traction forces.\n\nAptamers have been used to create hot start functions in PCR enzymes to prevent non-specific amplification during the setup and initial phases of PCR reactions.\n\n"}

She was born at St Pancras London on 14 May 1827, the second surviving daughter of John Worrell and Henrietta Ann (\"née\" Austin). Her claim of a first marriage at 14 does not fit with her official marriage in 1848 to a merchant navy officer J. A. Davies, with whom she came to Australia in 1852. After Davies' death she married ship's captain William Dugdale in Melbourne in March 1853. They settled at Queenscliff where sons Einnim, Carl and Austin were born.\n\nAfter separating from William Dugdale in the late 1860s, she moved to the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell where she remained until a few years before her death on 17 June 1918 at Point Lonsdale. Her third husband Frederick Johnson, whom she married in 1903, predeceased her.\n\nHer campaign for 'equal justice for women' began with a letter to Melbourne's \"Argus\" newspaper in April 1869. It peaked during the 1880s in radical public debate as a member of Melbourne's Eclectic Society and the Australasian Secular Association, through her utopian allegory \"A Few Hours in a Far-Off Age\" and in the formation in May 1884 of the Victorian Women's Suffrage Society, the first of its kind in Australia. That same year, Henrietta wrote a scathing judgement of the Victorian courts, and their inability to protect women from violent crimes. Published in the \"Melbourne Herald\", her words cut straight to the core of the issue: 'Women's anger,' she wrote, 'was compounded by the fact that those who inflicted violence upon women had a share in making the laws while their victims did not.'\n\nShe was acknowledged as a suffrage pioneer when Australian women attained the vote and the associated right to stand for federal parliament in June 1902 (a world first) and when the State of Victoria belatedly followed suit in December 1908. Dugdale died on 17 June 1918 in Point Lonsdale, Australia.\n\nA street in the Canberra suburb of Cook is named for her.\n\nIn 2013, she was nationally recognised as a critical first-wave Australian feminist, and The Dugdale Trust for Women & Girls, is named in honour of her life's work. Dugdale was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001. The Dugdale Trust for Women & Girls is a national harm-prevention institution for which The Victorian Women's Trust operates as trustee.\n\n\n"}

It has been observed in bacteria, plants and fungi. A chemical gradient can influence the growth of the organism in a positive or negative way. Positive growth is characterized by growing towards a stimulus and negative growth is growing away from the stimulus.\n\nChemotropism is slightly different from Chemotaxis, the major difference being that chemotropism is related to growth, while chemotaxis is related to locomotion.\n\nOne prime example of chemotropism is seen in plant fertilization and pollen tube elongation of angiosperms, flowering plants. Unlike animals, plants cannot move, and therefore needs a delivery mechanism for sexual reproduction. Pollen, which contains the male gametophyte is transferred to another plant via insects or wind. If the pollen is compatible it will germinate and begin to grow. The ovary releases chemicals that stimulates a positive chemotropic response from the developing pollen tube. In response the tube develops a defined tip growth area that promotes directional growth and elongation of the pollen tube due to a calcium gradient. The steep calcium gradient is localized in the tip and promotes elongation and orientation of the growth. This calcium gradient is essential for the growth to occur; it has been shown that inhibiting the formation of the gradient results in no growth. As the pollen tube continues to grow towards the ovules, the male sperm remains in the apical region and is transported to the female ovule. The pollen tube elongates at a rate comparable to neurite development\n\nAn example of positive and negative chemotropism is shown by a plant's roots; the roots grow towards useful minerals displaying positive chemotropism, and grow away from harmful acids displaying negative chemotropism.\n\nIn more complex organisms an example of chemotropic movement includes the growth of individual neuronal cell axons in response to extracellular signals. Secreted protein can either repel or attract specific neurons. Some signal proteins such as netrins, semaphorins, neurotrophins and fibroblast growth factors have been identified in aiding neuronal growth. These signals guide the developing axon to innervate the correct target tissue. The neuronal growth cones are guided by gradients of chemoattractant molecules released from their intermediate or final targets. There is evidence that the axons of peripheral neurons are guided by chemotropism and the directed growth of some central axons is also a chemotropic response, it remains to be determined whether chemotropism also operates in the central nervous system. Evidence has also been noted in neuronal regeneration, where chemotropic substances guide the ganglionic neurites towards the degenerated neuronal stump.\n\nFungal chemotropism was first reported over 100 years ago by Anton de Bary. One example of fungi using chemotropism is seen in Yeast.Yeast release chemical pheromones in order to attract mates. Each haploid yeast cells express specific haploid genes; haploid α-cells express α-genes and haploid a-cells express a-genes. Each cell type releases a unique pheromone: a- or α-factor. By secreting these factors a chemical gradient is formed that attracts the other type of yeast cell during mating. In order for the yeast to sense the gradient they have to have proper receptors that bind a- or α-factor: Ste3 and Ste2 respectively. The receptors to detect the pheromones are seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Once activated, there is a signaling cascade that results in the activation of transcription factors for mating-specific genes such as those involved in cell cycle arrest, directional polarization towards the chemical gradient, and sexual hyphae formation. When the cells get two Yeast cells are close enough their fungal hyphae merge to form a diploid zygote.\n\nOther examples of Chemotropism\n\nThe addition of atmospheric nitrogen, also called nitrogen fixation, is an example of chemotropism.\n\n"}
{"id": "1970724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970724", "title": "Dried cranberry", "text": "Dried cranberry\n\nDried cranberries are made by partially dehydrating fresh cranberries, a process similar to making grapes into raisins. They are popular in trail mix, salads, breads, with cereals, or eaten on their own. Dried cranberries are sometimes referred to as craisins due to the name's similarity to raisins, though the word \"Craisin\" is a registered trademark of Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. and cannot be officially applied to dried cranberries from other manufacturers.\n\nMost commercially produced dried cranberries contain added sugar, and they may also be coated in very small quantities of vegetable oil to keep them from sticking together.\n\nMany home recipes for dried cranberries involve allowing the cranberries to sit overnight in a water and sugar solution, prior to freeze-drying or air-drying. This can deprive the cranberries of some natural nutrients that would be contained in fresh cranberries.\n\nDried cranberries contain the same nutrients as fresh cranberries (notably dietary fiber and antioxidants). However, commercial drying processes substantially reduce the vitamin A and vitamin C content. The nutrient density is also reduced if sugar is added.\n\nThe nutrition facts for dried cranberries vary significantly depending on the brand.\nNutrition facts for 1/3 cup (40 g) of Ocean Spray dried cranberries are as follows:\n\n\nDried cranberries contain no cholesterol, or saturated or trans fats. Consuming dried cranberries will supply very little amounts of an individual's daily requirement for vitamins and minerals. The most substantial daily amount supplied is the mineral manganese, at 5% of the daily recommended intake. Having 1/4 cup of dried cranberries will supply one serving of fruits and vegetables, 25% of the daily recommendation from the USDA. The Canadian food guide recommends 7–10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily to reduce stroke, heart disease, and cancer risks. In Canada, Ocean Spray Craisins are given the Health Check symbol. This symbol is only given to food products that meet the registered dieticians' nutrient requirements. In the United States and Canada, Craisins are also considered to be a nut free product.\n\nCranberries with minimal processing contain the highest amount of antioxidants, although dried cranberries retain some antioxidants.\n\nSome antioxidants include phenolic acids, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanin. It is the anthocyanin that provides pigment to supply cranberries with their robust red color.\n\nThe added sugar can be a drawback for this product. Essentially, the sugar is added to improve texture and water content, and to reduce tartness.\n\nDried cranberries made with less sugar may be helpful for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes. Because less sugar is added, there is a lower glycemic index and thus less of an insulin response occurs. However, this has not been the case in recent studies of participants with higher response times on glycemic intake/glucose output testing batteries.\n\nDried cranberries can be used as an addition in various foods including salads, oatmeal, cookies, muffins, loaves, breads and trail mix. They can act as a direct replacement for raisins or any dried fruit.\nBecause dried cranberries are a dried fruit, spoilage is less of a concern than for fresh fruit. Dried cranberries can be a useful product to carry while traveling because of their extended shelf life.\n\nDried cranberries are sometimes packaged with other flavorings. Dried cranberries can also come covered in chocolate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1970741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970741", "title": "National Bank Note", "text": "National Bank Note\n\nNational Bank Notes were United States currency banknotes issued by National banks chartered by the United States Government. The notes were usually backed by United States bonds the bank deposited with the United States Treasury. In addition, banks were required to maintain a redemption fund amounting to five percent of any outstanding note balance, in gold or \"lawful money\".\n\nPrior to the American Civil War, state banks issued their own banknotes and chartered private banks to issue banknotes as well. Privately issued banknotes were nominally backed by specie (hard money) or financial securities held by the banks but oversight of issuing banks often was lax and encouraged wildcat banking, in which fraudulent institutions issued worthless banknotes. During the Civil War, in 1863, the National Banking Act established a system of National Banks which were empowered to issue National Bank Notes subject to federal oversight. The chartering of banks and administrative control over the issuance of National Bank Notes were the responsibility of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. A 2 percent tax on state bank notes was authorized in 1864 to speed conversion to the new system, only to be increased the next year to 10 percent, then 20 percent.\n\nFrom 1863 to 1935, National Bank Notes were issued by banks throughout the country and in US territories. Banks with a federal charter would deposit bonds in the US Treasury. The banks then could issue banknotes worth up to 90 percent of the value of the bonds. The federal government would back the value of the notes—the issuance of which created a demand for the government bonds needed to back them.\n\nThe program was a form of monetization of the Federal debt. Bonds eligible as collateral for posting to the Treasury were said to have the \"circulation privilege\" and the interest they bore provided seigniorage to the National Banks.\n\nEach National Bank Note bore the issuing bank's national charter number as well as the serial number assigned to the note by that bank. Low serial-numbered notes were often withdrawn as souvenirs by the bank officers who signed them.\n\nExcept for the last few years of issue, all of the National Bank Notes were large-sized.\n\nThrough much of their earlier history of issue, national banknotes used designs in which the issuing bank's name was prominently displayed, rather than \"The United States Of America\". One design used for many years featured a portrait on the obverse, near the left edge, and the bank's name printed in prominent shaded type in the middle. The historical figures seen on these notes usually were different from those on the same denominations of paper currency today.\n\nLarge-size notes bore two serial numbers. The Treasury serial number indicated the total number of notes of that series and denomination issued by all banks. The bank serial number indicated the number of notes of that series and denomination issued only by that bank. Large size notes also bore four signatures. Two signatures were those of the Register of the Treasury and Treasurer of the United States and were printed as part of the note's design. The other two signatures were those of the bank's cashier and president, and were individually signed by those officers prior to issuing the note. Notes were sent to the bank by the Treasury and typically signed as uncut sheets, so that the top edge of some notes show the lower part of a signature (such as the descender of a \"y\" or \"j\") from the note above it. Notes were often cut apart with scissors, so that the top and bottom edges of notes can be uneven and cut into the borders of the design.\n\nMost, but not all, large size national banknotes showed the charter number of the issuing bank on the obverse. In some cases the charter number was printed once, but typically the charter number appeared twice. The issuing bank's charter number was carefully positioned inside the engraved border, as well as overprinted elsewhere on the obverse. To aid Treasury workers in sorting banknotes, later large size notes also showed a letter to indicate the region of the country in which the issuing bank was located—\"N\" for New England, \"E\" for East, \"S\" for South, \"M\" for Mid-West, \"W\" for West, and \"P\" for Pacific coast.\n\nWith the advent of small-size banknotes came significant design changes for all types of paper currency including National Bank Notes. As a result of the changes, each denomination now had the same portrait and, except for minor variations, the same decorative features that would characterize all types of United States currency from the late 1920s to the early 1990s. The elaborate rendition of the bank's name was omitted from engraved design, but was now simply over-stamped in black ink, just above the engraved lettering of the promise-to-pay. Similarly, the issuing bank's charter number was omitted from the engraved border, and now simply overprinted in dark ink. In the case of the last issues of small size National Bank Notes, referred to as Type 2 notes, the charter number also appeared twice in brown ink in line with the note's serial numbers.\n\nSmall size National Bank Notes look very similar to, but are distinctly different from, the emergency 1933 issue of the Federal Reserve Bank Notes. These were printed using National Bank Note plates with slight design changes. Both say \"National Currency\", but have different issuers.\n\nNational Bank Notes were retired as a currency type by the U.S. government in the 1930s during the great depression as currency in the U.S. was consolidated into Federal Reserve Notes, United States Notes, and silver certificates; privately issued banknotes were eliminated. The passage of the Gold Reserve Act created an accounting gain for the Treasury, part of which was used to provide funds to retire all bonds against which National Banks Notes could be issued.\n\nSometimes these notes are called \"hometown\" notes, with their popularity deriving from the wide range of towns and cities that issued them. Among paper money hobbyists, especially in the U.S., these notes are avidly studied and collected. Some were issued in large numbers and remain inexpensive to collectors today. Others associated with rare banks, towns, states and combinations thereof and are quite valuable. A note from Walla Walla, in what was then Washington Territory, sold for $161,000 in a June 2010 sale at Heritage Auctions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970744", "title": "Oscar Brown", "text": "Oscar Brown\n\nOscar Brown Jr. (October 10, 1926May 29, 2005) was an American singer, songwriter, playwright, poet, civil rights activist, and actor. Aside from his career, Brown ran unsuccessfully for office in both the Illinois state legislature and the U.S. Congress. Brown wrote many songs (125 have been published), 12 albums, and more than a dozen musical plays.\n\nBrown was born in Chicago, Illinois to Oscar Brown Sr. and Helen (née Clark). Brown's father was an attorney and real estate broker. Brown's first acting debut was on the radio show \"Secret City\" at the age of 15. For high school, Brown attended Englewood Technical Prep Academy (then known as Englewood High School). After high school, Brown attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Lincoln University but later dropped out. He also served a stint in the U.S. Army.\n\nBrown's father intended for him to follow in his footsteps and become a practicing lawyer. While he did help his father at his practice, he ventured off into other careers such as advertising and served in the army in the mid-1950s. He also wrote songs. \n\nWhen Mahalia Jackson recorded one of his songs, \"Brown Baby,\" he began to focus on a career as a songwriter. His first major contribution to a recorded work was a collaboration with Max Roach, \"We Insist!\", which was an early record celebrating the black freedom movement in the United States. Columbia Records signed Brown as a solo artist, who was by now in his mid-thirties and married with five children.\n\nIn 1960, Brown released his first LP, \"Sin & Soul\", recorded from June 20 to October 23, 1960. Printed on the cover of the album were personal reviews by well-known celebrities and jazz musicians of the time, including Steve Allen, Lorraine Hansberry, Nat Hentoff, Dorothy Killgallen, Max Roach and Nina Simone (Simone would later cover his \"Work Song\" and Steve Allen would later hire him for his \"Jazz Scene USA\" television program). The album is regarded as a \"true classic\" for openly tackling the experiences of African Americans with songs such as \"Bid 'Em In\" and \"Afro Blue\". \"Sin & Soul\" is also significant because Brown took several popular jazz instrumentals and combined them with self-penned lyrics on songs such as \"Dat Dere\", \"Afro Blue\" and \"Work Song\". This began a trend that would continue with several other major jazz vocalists. Several of the tracks from \"Sin & Soul\" were embraced by the 1960s Mod movement, such as \"Humdrum Blues\", \"Work Song\" and \"Watermelon Man\". \"Sin & Soul\" was followed by \"Between Heaven and Hell\" (1962). The success of \"Sin & Soul\" meant that much more money was spent on production and Quincy Jones and Ralph Burns were bought in to handle the arrangements.\n\nHowever, Brown was soon to fall down the pecking order at Columbia following a rearrangement of the management at the company. His third album was notable for the lack of any self-composed songs, and Columbia was having a hard time packaging him as an artist. They were unsure whether Brown was suited to middle-of-the-road/easy listening nightclubs or alternatively should be presented as a jazz artist. Brown was given much more creative freedom for his fourth album, \"Tells It Like It Is\" (1963), and he was back to his creative best, composing songs such as \"The Snake\", which became a Northern Soul classic when it was covered by Al Wilson, and has featured on several adverts. Despite this return to form, and having been told by the new head of Columbia, that he was high on the company's priorities, his contract at Columbia was not renewed.\n\nHe attempted to mount a major musical stage show in New York City called \"Kicks & Co.\" in 1961. Host Dave Garroway turned over an entire broadcast of the \"Today\" show to Brown to perform numbers from the show and try to raise the necessary funds to launch it on the stage. \"Kicks & Co.\" is set on an all-African-American college campus in the American South during the early days of attempted desegregation. The character Mr. Kicks is an emissary of Satan, sent to try to derail these efforts in which the play's protagonist, Ernest Black, has become involved. This was the first of several theatrical endeavors by Brown, and like all of them, the public was not won over sufficiently to allow financial success, despite acclaim by some critics. His longest-running relative success, thanks to the participation of Muhammad Ali, was \"Big-Time Buck White\". Another notable musical show, \"Joy\", saw two incarnations (in 1966 and 1969) and again addressed social issues. Appearing with Brown were his wife, Jean Pace, and the Brazilian singer/accordionist Sivuca. RCA released the original cast recording around 1970; it is long out of print. In 1962, he worked on the Westinghouse syndicated television program \"Jazz Scene USA\", produced by Steve Allen. Brown was the show's presenter and it featured a new musical guest each week.\n\nBrown was married to Jean Pace, the older sister of actress Judy Pace. He was the father of seven children. His son, Oscar \"BoBo\" Brown III was a bassist and musical arranger who died in a car crash in August 1996. His daughter Maggie is a singer. A Chicago musical review referred to the trio as \"The First Family of Swing.\" They were joined by the youngest daughter, Africa Pace Brown, in an effort to popularize his music. Brown's first son, Napoleon \"David\" Brown, inspired the song \"Brown Baby\" and helped his father promotional appearances and business. The remaining family members consist of Donna Brown Kane, Joan Olivia Brown, and Iantha Brown Casen, who participated in some of her father's production. On May 29, 2005, Oscar Brown died in his hometown of Chicago from osteomyelitis at the age of 78.\n\nBrown founded the Oscar Brown Jr. H.I.P. Legacy Foundation to continue his humanitarian work. He participated in an anti-apartheid protest rally in Compton College in 1976.\n\nBrown wrote the vocalese lyrics to the Duke Pearson melody \"Jeannine\" as sung by Eddie Jefferson on the album \"The Main Main\" recorded in October 1974 and covered by The Manhattan Transfer on their 1984 album \"Bop Doo-Wopp\". \"Somebody Buy Me a Drink\", a track from \"Sin & Soul\", was covered by David Johansen and the Harry Smiths on their eponymous first album. \"Hymn to Friday\" from \"Between Heaven and Hell\" is played on jazz radio stations such as WDCB. Pianist Wynton Kelly recorded \"Strongman\" with his trio in the late 1950s. Nina Simone popularized Brown's lyrics to \"Work Song\", \"Afro Blue\", and \"Bid 'Em In.\" Brown's lyrics to \"Afro Blue\" have been performed by Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Lizz Wright. Vocalist Karrin Allyson cited Brown as an inspiration and has performed his compositions on several of her albums. Brown was scheduled to contribute lyrics to Allyson's 2006 album \"Footprints\" before his death; instead she recorded his songs \"A Tree and Me\" and \"But I Was Cool\" as a tribute. Brown was the subject of a tribute album by cabaret singer Linda Kosut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the younger brother of Divitiacus, the Aedui druid and statesman. The Aedui were allies of Rome, but Dumnorix was a leader of the tribe’s anti-Roman faction, who “...thought it better to be dominated by their fellow Gauls... rather than the Romans.”\n\nIn the years preceding Julius Caesar’s governorship of Transalpine Gaul the Helvetii tribe planned an invasion of western Gaul. Orgetorix, a prominent Helvetii chieftain, conspired with Dumnorix, and Casticus of the Sequani to make themselves kings in their own tribes. Then by their combined power rule all of Gaul in a Gallic version of the triumvirate. To strengthen the alliance Orgetorix married his daughter to Dumnorix. However, the conspiracy was discovered and Orgetorix died a short time after amid rumours of suicide. Dumnorix used his influence to persuade the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to migrate through their territory.\n\nUpon arriving in Gaul in 58 BC Caesar opposed the migration militarily. He built fortifications at Lake Geneva and either requested or demanded that the Aedui, who had been named friend and ally of Rome, supply his soldiers with grain. Dumnorix was very popular and had a large contingent of person retainers. He used his influence to delay the grain supply. Caesar forced the Helvetii to take an alternate path, then inflicted a devastating defeat on the tribe at the Battle of the Arar.\n\nCaesar pursued the Helvetii, using the Gallic cavalry to screen his advance. Dumnorix’ personal retainers made up a sizeable contingent of the Gallic auxiliary. Dumnorix colluded with the Helvetii and at a key moment in an engagement withdrew his unit, giving the Helvetii the victory.\n\nWith his grain supply desperate, Caesar summoned the leaders of his Gallic allies. Liscus, the chief magistrate or \"Vergobretus\" of the Aedui, revealed to Caesar that Dumnorix was responsible for withholding the supplies and had also been in command of the unit whose flight had cost him the cavalry engagement. Dumnorix was spared any serious retribution at the intervention of his brother Diviciacus, who had good relations with Caesar and the Romans. Caesar agreed instead to place Dumnorix under surveillance.\n\nDumnorix continued to be troublesome, and in 54 BC was one of the Gaulish leaders Caesar proposed to take with him as hostages on his second expedition to Britain, fearing that they might cause trouble in his absence. Dumnorix pleaded his fear of the sea and religious obligations in an attempt to get Caesar to leave him behind. When this failed, he claimed that Caesar intended to have them all killed out of sight of their people. Finally, he attempted to escape from Caesar's camp along with the Aeduan cavalry. Caesar sent the rest of the cavalry after him, and Dumnorix was killed, shouting that he was \"a free man and a citizen of a free state\". The rest of the Aeduan cavalry returned to Caesar's service.\n\nHis name, like other Gaulish language names (Ambiorix, Orgetorix, Vercingetorix) contains a -\"rix\" suffix which is etymologically related to the Latin \"rex\", Gaelic \"rí\", Sanskrit \"rāja-\" and German \"Reich\", indicating kingship or rule; it is probably an aristocratic suffix. \"Dumno-\" is etymologically related to the Gaelic \"domhan\" \"world\", indicating that the name may be translated as \"king of the world\".\n\n\n"}

Most of the standing structures have been built, over many years, by the industrious Hakka Chinese, upon marshy and reclaimed low-lying land. Over the past several decades, it has served as the location of Calcutta's Chinatown. This is not a coincidence; the Hakka Chinese of Calcutta have gradually turned this part of the Kolkata into an important destination for sourcing finished and semi-finished leather. The Hakka Chinese specialized in the manufacture of leather and turned it into one of the major industries of West Bengal, providing employment to tens of thousands of local inhabitants. In addition to the huge volume of exports to the developing and developed countries, finished leather is supplied to the major shoe and leather goods manufacturers all over the country. Many made-to-order shoe shops in Kolkata are also run by entrepreneurs from this community.\n\nAmidst the Chinese establishments and restaurants, there is a very old and auspicious 'Kali Mondir'. The temple is situated near Kim Fa restaurant and Relax Foreign Liquor Shop. This temple is visited by both Chinese and Hindu devotees. One needs to be there to experience the spectacle of two cultures harmoniously doing business generation after generation.\n\nFood from Tangra is a distinct variety of traditional Hakka Chinese cuisine adapted to Indian ingredients and the Bengali palate. This has spread to the rest of India, along with the recipes earlier unique to Tangra. Tangra is now the most popular destination for Chinese food. Chinese food sold in Tangra restaurants are now known all over the world as \"Hakka Style\" Chinese food.\n\nKolkata Chinatown is changing rapidly. The population is no longer renewed by waves of migration and many traditional professions such as dentistry, laundry and tannery are no longer the preserve of the Chinese. The West Bengal government, under direction from the Supreme Court, recently moved all tanneries to Bantala, a suburb in the east of Kolkata. However, Tangra has been an integral part of the culture of the Chinese community in India.\n\nThe success of \"Hakka style\" Chinese food in the rest of India encouraged a migration of many Chinese families to other cities as the economic fortunes of Tangra decayed. Many landmark Chinese eateries, including Nanking, Waldorf, Peiping and Fat Mama have closed or changed hands and fortunes. The once prosperous Calcutta Chinese community is now clearly in decline. However, a boom in Tangra's unique Indian-Chinese food is attracting a lot of attention these days and the cuisine will probably live on in Kolkata and in the global Indian Diaspora.\n\nThe Cha Project, is designed to preserve Tiretti Bazaar and develop Tangra.\n\nThe East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as \"Dihi Panchannagram\" and Tangra was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.\n\nIn the eastern fringes of Kolkata, the neighbourhoods such as Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia and Dhapa, were populated largely with people who migrated from poverty-ridden and caste-ridden villages, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They came with dreams of a better life but landed in the slums with open drains, pigsties, factory chimneys and pungent chemicals. They found work in the tanneries and factories, and also engaged in menial work. A big proportion of them were Chamars, but there also were Doms, Dosads, Mehtars and Kahars. They were all Harijans and they formed a majority. They escaped from the petty persecution they faced in their villages but were far removed from the mainstream of urban life and culture. They have been here, living in depressing conditions, for more than a century.\n\nTangra police station is in the Eastern Suburban division of Kolkata Police. It is located at 15, Gobinda Chandra Khatik Road, Kolkata-700015.\n\nUltadanga Women police station covers all police districts under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Suburban division i.e. Beliaghata, Entally, Manicktolla, Narkeldanga, Ultadanga, Tangra and Phoolbagan.\n\n\nPark Circus railway station on Sealdah South lines is the nearest railway station.\n\n"}

Nathan plays Harry Schechter, heir to a Hollywood studio forced to make a musical comedy porno in order to stave off bankruptcy. The movie features a series of farcical lewd musical numbers in the style of classical Hollywood musical comedies including: \"Orgasm\", \"Lesbian Butch Dyke\", and \"Dancing Dildos.\" The movie has a low-budget feel, with a \"musical-within-a-movie\" theme in the tradition of \"Singin' in the Rain\", but with satirical sexual humor.\n\nAn early staple of Cinemax, it has become a cult film since its initial release and was released on DVD in 2001 and is currently available on Blu-ray on Kritzerland. It was one of several farcical musical-comedy collaborations between Kimmel (who also co-starred in the movie) and Williams, along with \"The Creature Wasn't Nice\" in 1981. Originally distributed by Paramount Pictures in 1976, it was picked up by World-Northal in 1977 and re-released to great acclaim, first in New York, where it played for three months exclusively at the 68th Street Playhouse before gaining wider distribution.\n\nThe film received polarizing reviews.

Murphy of \"Variety\" wrote, \"A few clever bits are downed in a larger sea of silliness, forced gags and predictable cliche.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film half of one star out of four, calling it \"juvenile\" and \"flaccid.\" Alan M. Kriegsman of \"The Washington Post\" panned the film for \"crude photography, bad editing, sophomoric story and forgettable music.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was more positive, writing, \"Silly, sophomoric, at times downright inept, this little low-budget venture picked up by Paramount is more often than not hilarious, offering good, tonic laughter to those not offended by nudity and blunt language.\" Leonard Maltin's film guide gave it two stars out of four and noted, \"Basically a one-joke idea that wears thin despite an air of amiability.\"\n\n"}

They had the same value as other kinds of notes of similar value. Federal Reserve Bank Notes are different from Federal Reserve Notes in that they are backed by one of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, rather than by all collectively. They were backed in a similar way to National Bank Notes, using U.S. bonds, but issued by Federal Reserve banks instead of by chartered National banks. Federal Reserve Bank Notes are no longer issued; the only U.S. banknotes still in production since 1971 are the Federal Reserve Notes.\n\nLarge size Federal Reserve Bank Notes were first issued in 1915 in denominations of $5, $10, and $20, using a design that shared elements with both the National Bank Notes and the Federal Reserve Notes of the time. Additional denominations of $1, $2, and $50 were issued in 1918.\n\nSmall size Federal Reserve Bank Notes were printed as an emergency issue in 1933 using the same paper stock as National Bank Notes. They were printed in denominations of $5 through $100. A National Bank Note has a line for the signature of the president of the national bank. The small size Federal Reserve Bank Note printed a bar over the label for this line, since Federal Reserve Banks had governors, not presidents. The wording was also changed to add, \"Or by like deposit of other securities\" after the phrase, \"Secured by United States bonds deposited with the Treasurer of the United States of America\". The twelve Federal Reserve Districts also appear on the bills as black alphabetically sequenced letters, from \"A\" to \"L\", a system essentially followed today on the $1 and $2 bills.\n\nThis emergency issue of notes was prompted by the public hoarding of cash due to many bank failures happening at the time. This also limited the ability of the National Banks to issue notes of their own. Small size Federal Reserve Bank Notes were discontinued in 1934 and have been no longer available from banks since 1945. As small size notes, they have brown seals and serial numbers, as do National Bank Notes of the era. But while they look very similar, and both have the words, \"National Currency\" across the top of the obverse, they had different issuers and are considered to be distinctly different types of bills.\n"}

It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 105th Precinct.\n\nLaurelton derives its name from the Laurelton station on the Long Island Rail Road, which was named for the laurels that grew there over 100 years ago. It was modeled after an English village, with stately Tudor-style homes, both attached and detached. A few co-ops exist in a former garden apartment complex, there has been some new construction but no high-rise buildings, which has enabled Laurelton to keep its small town feel. The area of Laurelton closest to Rosedale and Cambria Heights consists primarily of single-family homes whereas the area abutting Springfield Gardens contains more multi family homes. The area south of Merrick Boulevard contains many large, individually designed houses, while certain blocks to the north, running eastward from Francis Lewis Boulevard, have attached, Tudor-style rowhouses. Laurelton also has a series of streets with planted center malls.\n\nIn the 1930s through 1970s, Laurelton was home to many Jewish-American families but succeeding generations have included various Afrodescended groups, including African-Americans, Caribbean/West Indians and West Africans, many of whom were attracted to Laurelton's more suburban-like environment. \n\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Laurelton was 24,453, a decrease of 1,922 (7.3%) from the 26,375 in 2000.

As a graduate student of Nagasaki University, he started from drawing his own dōjinshi, based on video games that were famous at that time (somewhere in the 1980s). With that dōjinshi, he practiced and improved his drawing skills day by day. Yoshizaki said that his experience in drawing dōjinshi was the most priceless experience that he ever had. According to him, making dōjinshi gave him the opportunity to seek through the world of the manga industry, with all aspects from drawing to producing (meeting with printers, editing process etc.). This allows him to do all the work, rather working in a big-scale production company that lets him work in one particular branch.\n\nYoshizaki later worked as an assistant to manga artist Katsu Aki. His first publication was featured in a compilation book published by Shogakukan in 1989.\n\nHe is best known for his manga \"Keroro Gunso\", published as \"Sgt.

The action takes place in contemporary Macau. The film made its premiere at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, and was in competition for the Golden Lion.\n\nIn 1998 Macau, former mobster Wo (Nick Cheung) lives quietly with his wife, Jin (Josie Ho), and his newborn child in a nondescript apartment, having turned over a new leaf. But vengeful mob boss Fay (Simon Yam)—whom Wo once tried to assassinate—has dispatched a pair of ageing hitmen to cut that peaceful existence short. Once arrived, killers Blaze (Anthony Wong) and Fat (Lam Suet) find a second pair of hitmen, Tai (Francis Ng) and Cat (Roy Cheung), who are determined to protect Wo. After a brief showdown, the whole group comes to an uneasy truce, lay their weapons down and bond over dinner— after all, these men grew up together in the same gang. Reunited and hungry for another score, they visit a fixer called Jeff (Cheung Siu-fai), who gives the gang the job of killing a rival boss, Boss Keung (Gordon Lam), as well as telling them about the location of a large quantity of gold being transported for a corrupt official. Wo makes the gang promise that if anything happens to him, his wife and son will be looked after.\n\nLater that night the friends find Boss Keung in a restaurant; however, Boss Fay, wanting to take over the other boss's territory, interrupts the meeting. Boss Fay recognising Blaze sitting in the restaurant, openly chastises and humiliates him for not killing Wo, culminating in Fay shooting Blaze. However unbeknownst to Fay, Blaze is wearing a bulletproof vest and survives. Wo, seeing this, opens fire before Fay can finish Blaze off. A gunfight erupts in the restaurant with Fay being shot in the leg and Keung in the arm. The two bosses come to an agreement to share territory and profits, further agreeing to kill the gang of friends. Having narrowly escaped the restaurant shootout the friends decide to take a severely shot Wo to an underground clinic for medical assistance. After negotiating a price, the doctor operates removing the bullets from Wo. However, as he is sewing up Wo's wound, there is a loud banging at the door. Having heard this the remainder of the waiting friends hide in the doctor's flat. The door is answered and both Fay and Keung burst in seeking help for their injuries sustained in the restaurant shootout. Fay pushes a still unconscious Wo out of the way and orders the doctor to tend to his wound first. Meanwhile, Keung takes a look around the flat and comes across a hiding Fat. Realizing that they have been found, the gang begin to dispatch the bosses' henchmen. Meanwhile, Wo wakes up and slowly gets to his feet to escape before collapsing. The rest of the friends not knowing where Wo has got to, make an exit down the back of the apartment. However whilst escaping across the back courtyard, Boss Fay throws Wo from a high window and pins down Wo's friends preventing any rescue attempt. The gang desperately try to retrieve their critically injured but still alive friend but Fay still shoots at them and even manages to shoot Wo. Quick thinking Fat seeing that his friend has come to rest on some tarpaulin pulls Wo to safety and the gang escape. Now in the car Wo knowing he is near death, asks to be taken back to his wife and son. Wo dies shortly after.\n\nHanding Wo's body over to his wife, Jin, she demands to know what has happened and in her grief opens fire on Blaze and Tai who run away. Jin contemplates killing herself and her son but thinks better of it. She instead smashes up the furniture in the house and makes a funeral pyre for Wo. She then sets fire to Wo and the flat and leaves with her son. The reduced gang leave the city in search of the gold. After coming across the heavily guarded convoy carrying the gold, they flip a coin to decide whether to hijack it or not. The coin comes up tails meaning they will not proceed with the robbery. After carrying on down the road however the come across the convoy being ambushed by another gang. They witness all the police officers bar one crack-shot being killed. The friends decide to help the officer (Richie Jen) by dispatching the rest of the gang. The friends appreciating the policeman's sharp shooting decide to split the gold with him and drive off to a hidden dock to transport the gold to the mainland and a new life. Meanwhile, back in the city, Jin still furious about the death of her husband goes looking for the friends, asking many people until she is recognised by the fixer Jeff who in turn contacts his boss, Boss Fay.\n\nFay with a captured Jin calls a gloating Blaze, who is then informed of the situation. He is told to meet Fay at midnight otherwise Jin and her son will be killed. Determined to protect Jin after Wo's death, the friends agree and leave the officer at the dock with the gold telling him they will return by dawn. Once at the meeting place the four friends are confronted by Jin, whom Fay allows to shoot Blaze in revenge. However Blaze is again hit in the chest, surviving due to his bullet proof vest. Tai steps in, throwing a bag of gold at Fay's feet telling him that he can have it all if Fay lets them all go. Fay agrees, but tells them Blaze must stay to face the consequences of not following orders. Blaze agrees to this deal and the remainder of the friends leave with Jin. However, as they leave, Tai informs Jin of the boat and the policeman and tells her to drive there. With Jin safe the greatly outnumbered friends open fire. In the resulting gunfight all are killed including Boss Fay and Boss Keung. As the friends lie dying they all smile knowing they have kept their promise to Wo.\n\n\n\"Exiled\" was shown in Competition at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival, 2007 8th Jeonju International Film Festival, 2008 Midnight Sun Film Festival and the 2007 Seattle International Film Festival.\n\nThe film was awarded a Category III rating (18+ restriction), particularly for one scene showing Simon Yam's character shaking hands with another gangster with their left hands turned around, making a triads agreement handshake. The scene is present on the Mega-Star uncut Limited Edition DVD. However, only the Category IIB cut version was released in Hong Kong theatrically.\n\n\"Exiled\" was released in Hong Kong on 19 October. The film, on opening weekend, grossed a total of US$47,533. The film's total HK box-office take was US$687,434.\n\nIt was later released in the United States with an R-rating by the MPAA \"for strong violence and some sexual content.\" Following its limited released in the United States, \"Exiled\" grossed US$20,351 on opening weekend. The film's total gross was US$49,413.\n\nMagnolia Pictures acquired the North American rights of \"Exiled\" and the film was given a limited release as of 31 August 2007. The North American DVD version of the film was released on 11 January 2008.\n\n\"Exiled\" received fairly good reviews in the United States. The film is currently one of the highest-rated limited-release films of 2007 on Rotten Tomatoes at 82%. Critics often made comparisons to the early spaghetti western pictures made by filmmakers such as Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, hailing the film for its action sequences and dark humour. Newsweek Magazine even awarded the film at number 4 as one of 2007's \"Best Action Movie Scenes\"\nSome critics, however, were less enthusiastic by the film. Film critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", awarded the film a 2.5 star rating, writing:\n\nHong Kong film distributor Media Asia Group has announced a remake of \"Exiled\". The company brokered a deal with film producer Samuel Hadida, who is attached as a producer.\n\nThe Indian Malayalam film \"Bachelor Party\", released on 15 June 2012, is an uncredited remake of the film \"Exiled\".\n\n\n"}

Note that formula_4 is isomorphic to formula_5. Geometrically, the principal homogeneous spaces coming from elements of the Selmer group have \"K\"-rational points for all places \"v\" of \"K\". The Selmer group is finite. This implies that the part of the Tate–Shafarevich group killed by \"f\" is finite due to the following exact sequence\n\nThe Selmer group in the middle of this exact sequence is finite and effectively computable. This implies the weak Mordell–Weil theorem that its subgroup \"B\"(\"K\")/\"f\"(\"A\"(\"K\")) is finite. There is a notorious problem about whether this subgroup can be effectively computed: there is a procedure for computing it that will terminate with the correct answer if there is some prime \"p\" such that the \"p\"-component of the Tate–Shafarevich group is finite. It is conjectured that the Tate–Shafarevich group is in fact finite, in which case any prime \"p\" would work. However, if (as seems unlikely) the Tate–Shafarevich group has an infinite \"p\"-component for every prime \"p\", then the procedure may never terminate.\n\nIn some important cases, A = B = E, an elliptic curve (or A = E and B = E', two elliptic curves), and the map f = [m], is the \"multiply by m ∈ ℤ+\" map which is an isogeny (the other isogenies are complex multiplication). The image of the map mE covers E but it isn't quite the same thing, so E/mE isn't 0. There is a SES and a corresponding LES via coker and cohomology &c. We can extract an SES from the LES, this SES can be denoted (in general) by 0->U->V->W->0, then U injects into V and U is the ker(V->W), a general fact. This is why the Selmer group is expressed as a kernel. In this case V and W are cohomology groups from the LES. There are other details best explained via Homogeneous Spaces and Cohomology, see Silverman \n\nThis matters because the Hasse principle is decisive for Quadratic Forms (2nd order), but the Hasse principle often fails for Elliptic Curves (3rd order). The Selmer group represents the hypothesis of the Hasse principle and the Shaw group Ш represents the failure of the conclusion of the Hasse principle. The Hasse principle is based on the fact that a point in ℚ will, necessarily be a point in ℝ and in ℚ. (Here ℚ, or ℚ, is the p-adic completion of ℚ. The general case is for a valuation v and a number field K.) In the case of quadratic forms the Hasse principle is also sufficient, but (again) the Hasse principle can often fail for Elliptic Curves. The Hasse principle is also known as the Hasse Local/Global principle.\n\nMore generally one can define the Selmer group of a finite Galois module \"M\" (such as the kernel of an isogeny) as the elements of \"H\"(\"G\",\"M\") that have images inside certain given subgroups of \"H\"(\"G\",\"M\").\n\n"}

It has unlimited jurisdiction within the territory in civil matters, and hears the most serious criminal matters. It is around the middle of the Australian court hierarchy.\n\nShortly after the first settlement at Palmerston, Port Darwin in 1869–70, pressure was placed upon the South Australian government to establish a superior court in the then Northern Territory of South Australia. Although such a court was mooted, it was decided to send judges to Palmerston on circuit. The first circuit court was held in February 1875.\n\nThereafter, from 1875 to 1884, the government appointed persons as commissioners (usually the Government Resident) to exercise the power of a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia in all but trials of capital offences.\n\nFrom 1884 to 1911, a resident judge, with the title \"Judge of the Northern Territory\" exercised the full powers of the Supreme Court of South Australia under the Northern Territory Justice Act.\n\nThe court was established on 30 May 1911, shortly after South Australia surrendered the territory to the Commonwealth. The first judge of the court was Samuel James Mitchell. The only person to hold the office of Chief Judge, which was created in 1975, was Sir William Forster who held the position from 1977-1979. The position title was changed to Chief Justice in 1979, and Forster was the first Chief Justice from 1979-1985. There have been 6 Chief Justices since 1979 . There are currently six resident judges (including the Chief Justice) and two additional judges and two acting judges, making a total of ten Supreme Court justices. \n\nIn 1927, when the \"Northern Australia 1926 Act (Cth)\" came into force, the Northern Territory was divided into two territories; North Australia and Central Australia. The Supreme Court was not abolished, but continued to exist as the Supreme Court of North Australia and the Supreme Court of Central Australia. After the Northern Territory Act was repealed in 1931, the Northern Territory was reconstituted as a single Territory of the Commonwealth. The Supreme Court of Central Australia was abolished and the Supreme Court of North Australia continued as the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory.\n\nIn 1935 the Court began its first sittings on circuit in Alice Springs , a practice which still continues today. Circuit sittings in Katherine were also introduced in 1996.\n\nWhen a new Supreme Court complex was built, Indigenous artist Norah Nelson Napaljarri was chosen to design a mosaic for its forecourt.\nThe design concept of the Supreme Court, as requested by the client the Northern Territory Government, was to reflect the elements of the \"Greek Revival\" Hong Kong Shanghai Bank constructed in Hong Kong in the 1800s viz: the colonnade around the building, the mansard roof and the portico entrance as well as giving reference to its tropical location and its colonial past.\nThe collaborating architects were Peter Doig, Ron Findlay and Roger Linklater: the interior was designed by Susie Cole.\nThe architectural style is best described as Neo-colonial.\n\nThe Supreme Court occasionally sits in other locations in the Northern Territory, including Katherine, Tennant Creek and Nhulunbuy. The Supreme Court has also on occasion sat at remote aboriginal communities.\n\nThe Supreme Court includes the Court of Appeal, Court of Criminal Appeal, Civil and Criminal Trials and Appeals from the Northern Territory Magistrates Court. \n\nJudgments from Supreme Court trials are available to the public , as are the sentencing remarks , unless a suppression order has been taken preventing these being released (for example, involving juveniles, public figures or in some controversial matters).\n\nAs at November 2019 (appointment date in brackets):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970900", "title": "Waterloo–Reading line", "text": "Waterloo–Reading line\n\nThe Waterloo–Reading line (also known in the rail industry as the Windsor Lines) is a National Rail electric railway line between London Waterloo and Reading. The line runs west through a series of South West London suburbs to Reading, in central Berkshire. Its passenger operation is by South Western Railway (SWR), which also manage its stations.\n\nThe Waterloo–Reading line is the core of a group of lines and branches heading generally westwards from Waterloo, providing predominantly passenger services into London. All of the branches and connecting lines have direct services into a dedicated group of platforms at Waterloo, so most of the services using the line do not run the whole length of the line. After leaving Waterloo, the line runs parallel to the South West Main Line before diverging at Clapham Junction and heading westwards. Within Greater London, the Hounslow Loop Line diverges at Barnes and reconnects again near Feltham, whilst the Kingston Loop Line diverges at Twickenham to join up with the South West Main Line at New Malden. At Staines, the original route carries onto Windsor, whilst the 1853 route to Reading diverges to run via Egham. At Virginia Water, the Chertsey Branch Line provides another connection to the South West Main Line whilst at Ascot, the Ascot–Guildford line heads southwards towards Aldershot and Farnham. At Wokingham, the line is synonymous with the west end of the North Downs Line leading into Reading, to terminate in platforms 4, 5 and 6. The line also sees some freight services and special charters, which use the connecting line at Reading to join the Great Western Main Line or the Chertsey Loop/Branch Line to connect to the South West Main Line.\n\nDue to the large swathes of suburbs served along the line and the drop from four to two tracks west of Barnes, services between Reading and London Waterloo are relatively slow compared to the two fast tracks between Reading and London Paddington. The line is predominantly used for commuter traffic into London with most of the traffic being generated by intermediate stations. To ease over-crowding, a roll-out is underway of 8-car trains being extended to 10 coaches and there have been calls to change the service patterns to provide some additional and faster services, cutting out some of the intermediate stops.\n\nThe London and Southampton Railway opened the first stretch of railway between Nine Elms and Woking Common on 12 May 1838, and renamed itself as the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR) one month later. As the L&SWR continued extending its railway towards Southampton, the first branch was opened by the Richmond and West End Railway (R&WER) to Richmond on 27 July 1846. This branch line started at what is now Clapham Junction, although the station itself did not open until 2 March 1863. The terminus at Nine Elms was replaced on 11 July 1848 with a new station at Waterloo, originally named as Waterloo Bridge. The Richmond branch was extended further west by the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway (WS&SWR) opening as far as Datchet on 22 August 1848 and to Windsor on 1 December 1849. Both the R&WER and WS&SWR were purchased by the L&SWR before their respective lines had been completed.\n\nThe South Eastern Railway (SER) opened its line from Wokingham to Reading on 15 October 1849 under the auspices of the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&RR), which was then taken over by the SER in 1852. This was part of the SER line from London to Reading via Guidlford and terminated at Reading Southern railway station, which was adjacent to, but separate from the Great Western Railway station at Reading.\n\nThe line linking Staines with Wokingham was authorised in 1853 and built by the Staines, Wokingham and Woking Junction Railway, opening from Staines to Ascot on 4 June 1856 and onwards to Wokingham on 9 July 1856. Initial services on the line was 6 trains a day between Waterloo and Reading (2 on Sundays), building up to 14 trains a day (7 on Sunday) by 1928.The line was operated by the L&SWR from the outset, who leased it from the owning company in 1858 for 50% of the gross profits, before purchasing it outright in 1878.\n\nThere were now three competing routes to Reading: the GWR from Paddington at 36 miles; the LSWR from Waterloo at 43.5 miles and the SER from Charing Cross at 69 miles. Despite the disparity, the GWR was not the obvious choice due to relative position of Paddington station, west of the City of London. This allowed intense competition between the three companies until in 1858 a new agreement between the three companies was made to fix prices and share fares. The agreement led to a connecting spur between the SER and GWR railways in Reading being opened for goods traffic on 1 December 1858 and to passenger traffic on 17 January 1859. A better placed link was opened on 17 December 1899, and a third link on 1 June 1941. The link is today used by special services such as luxury steam services.\n\nThe line was electrified on the DC third rail system, initially at 660 volts, in sections:\n\nEarly on Sunday 15 November 2009 the bridge carrying the line over the River Crane, London, partly collapsed leading to service suspension. Services were restored eight days later on a temporary diversionary line with a 20 mph speed limit laid across the site of the disused Feltham Marshalling yard. The defective bridge was demolished and rebuilt.\n\nIn the current timetable, there are two trains per hour between Waterloo and Reading, every day of the week; the Reading service only calls at major stations Clapham Junction, Richmond, Twickenham, Feltham (with a short bus link to Heathrow Airport), Staines and then all stations to Reading. During peak hours, additional trains are run which skip Winnersh, Winnersh Triangle and Earley, and add stops at Vauxhall and Ashford (Surrey). \n\nConnecting lines add additional services on this line -\n\nServices are mainly formed of Class 458/5s, but a few 450s also work the line.\n\nDue to high demand and overcrowding for a considerable part of many services enhancements are underway. The stations between Waterloo and Staines, unless prohibited by bridges, are having platforms lengthened for 10-coach trains, which use converted Class 458 units. Platform 20 at the former Waterloo International Terminal re-entered service in October 2013. Additional trains were purchased in the early 2010s. On 20 November 2014, Network Rail published a plan, the Wessex Route Study, for wide consultation; its recommendations are to abolish the running of trains shorter than 10 coaches to Reading except in very low usage hours and to open more of the platforms at the former London Waterloo International with a suggested target date of 2019.\n\nIn March 2014, the Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership published a report showing the economic benefits of improvements to the Waterloo to Reading line. This looked at the economic benefits of increasing services, speeding up services (timetabling more semi-fast and fast services to improve access to major stops from London and from Reading) and adding access to Heathrow Airport, and concluded that the benefits exceeded the costs of such improvements.\n"}

{"id": "1970906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970906", "title": "White Riot", "text": "White Riot\n\n\"White Riot\" is a song by English punk rock band The Clash, released as the band's first single in March 1977 and also included on their self-titled debut album.\n\nThere are two versions of the song: the single version (also appearing on the US version of the album released in 1979), was one of the first songs they recorded at CBS Studio 3 on Whitfield Street in Central London, after signing with CBS Records. However, when they were recording the debut album, they decided to use a demo version of the song that they had recorded earlier in 1976 at Beaconsfield Studios in Buckinghamshire with Julien Temple. The rest of the demo tracks would eventually be released on the \"Sound System\" compilation album.\n\nThe album version has a running time of 1:58 and starts with Mick Jones counting off \"1-2-3-4\". The single version begins with the sound of a police siren and has a running time of 1:55.\n\nThe song is short and intense, in the typical punk style of three chords played very fast.\n\nLyrically, the song is about class economics and race and thus proved controversial, some people thought it was advocating a kind of race war.\n\nThe song was written after Joe Strummer and bassist Paul Simonon were involved in the riots at the Notting Hill Carnival of 1976.\n\nThe single's cover photograph was taken by Caroline Coon on 5 November 1976 at the band's rehearsal studio in Camden Town. The photo was inspired by real-life events where youths were randomly stopped and searched by police in the street. The original shot featured the phrase \"Hate and War\" on the back of Strummer's boiler suit, which was airbrushed for the released version and replaced with \"1977\".\n\n\"White Riot\" is considered a classic in The Clash canon, although as the band matured, Mick Jones would at times refuse to play it, considering it crude and musically inept. Over two decades later, Joe Strummer would perform it with his band the Mescaleros. The B-side of the single was \"1977\", a non-album track. This song was along similar lines to \"White Riot\", suggesting that the music of Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones was no longer relevant. Writing for Melody Maker in November 1976, Caroline Coon described the song as \"played with the force of an acetylene torch\". Billboard described it as \"the most controversial song The Clash ever did\".\n\nIn March 2005, \"Q\" magazine placed \"White Riot\" at number 34 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n\nThe song is featured in the soundtrack for the game \"Tony Hawk's Underground\".\n\nThe song was covered by Clash contemporaries Sham 69. The punk rock/Oi! band Cock Sparrer also did a live cover version of the song, which even appeared on their \"The Best of Cock Sparrer\" and \"England Belongs to Me\" albums. The Mekons' first single, \"Never Been in a Riot\" was a response to \"White Riot\".\n\nThe song has been covered by, among others, hip-hop/punk rock band The Transplants, rock/folk/carnival band Camper Van Beethoven, punk rock band Anti-Flag, Rise Against, Cracker, The Bad Shepherds alternative rock band Audioslave, and the Angelic Upstarts. The American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys have covered the song live, one recording of which is on their \"The Singles Collection: Volume One\" album. It was also performed by Rage Against the Machine at their free concert in Finsbury Park and at Download Festival in June 2010.\n\nPunk rock band Rise Against covered the song during their shows at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2011 after vocalist Tim McIlrath made a speech about the London riots of 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1970935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970935", "title": "Airs above the ground", "text": "Airs above the ground\n\nThe airs above the ground or school jumps are a series of higher-level, Haute ecole, classical dressage movements in which the horse leaves the ground. They include the capriole, the courbette, the mezair, the croupade and the levade. None are typically seen in modern competitive dressage. They are performed by horses of various riding academies such as the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and the Cadre Noir in Saumur, and may be seen in other dressage performances. The levade and courbette are a particular feature of the Doma Menorquina, the riding tradition of the island of Menorca. Horses such as the Andalusian, Lusitano, Lipizzan and Menorquín are the breeds most often trained to perform the airs today, in part due to their powerfully conformed hindquarters, which allow them the strength to perform these difficult movements. There were originally seven airs, many of which were used to build into the movements performed today.\n\nThere is a popular conception that these movements were originally taught to horses for military purposes, and indeed both the Spanish Riding School and the Cadre Noir are military foundations. However, while agility was necessary on the battlefield, most of the airs as performed today would have exposed the vulnerable underbelly of the horse to the weapons of foot soldiers. It is therefore more likely that the airs were exercises to develop the military horse and rider, rather than to be employed in combat.\n\nHorses are usually taught each air on the long rein without a rider, which is less strenuous for the animal. However, each movement is meant to eventually be performed under a rider.\n\nThe pesade and levade are the first airs taught to the High School horse, and it is from these that all other airs are taught. In the pesade, the horse raises its forehand off the ground and tucks the forelegs evenly, carrying all weight on the hindquarters, to form a 45 degree angle with the ground.\n\nThe levade was first taught at the beginning of the 20th century, asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30–35 degrees from the ground. Unlike the pesade, which is more of a test of balance, the decreased angle makes the levade an extremely strenuous position to hold, and requires a greater effort from the horse. Therefore, many horses are not capable of a good-quality levade. The levade is also a transition movement between work on the ground and the airs above the ground. Neither of these movements are equivalent to rearing, as they require precise control, excellent balance, and a great deal of strength, and are the product of correct training, rather than resistance from the horse.\n\nThe horse is asked to enter the pesade or levade from the piaffe, which asks the horse to increasingly engage its hindquarters, lowering them toward the ground and bringing the hind legs more toward its center of gravity. This gives the viewer the impression that the horse appears to sink down in back and rise in front. The position is held for a number of seconds, and then the horse quietly puts the forelegs back on the ground and proceeds at the walk, or stands at the halt. The levade is considered to be pinnacle of collection, as the horse carries all weight on the back legs, and has an extreme tucking of the hindquarters and coiling of the loins.\n\nIn the capriole (meaning \"leap of a goat\"), the horse jumps from a raised position of the forehand straight up into the air, kicks out with the hind legs, and lands more or less on all four legs at the same time. It requires an enormously powerful horse to perform correctly, and is considered the most difficult of all the airs above the ground. It is first introduced with the croupade, in which the horse does not kick out at the height of elevation, but keeps the hind legs tucked tightly under, and remains \"parallel\" to the ground. The horse is then taught the ballotade. In this movement, the horse's hind hooves are positioned so one can see its shoes if watching from behind, but the horse is not asked to kick out. When the horse demonstrates proficiency in the ballotade, the capriole is introduced.\n\nIn the courbette, the horse raises its forehand off the ground, tucks up forelegs evenly, and then jumps forward, never allowing the forelegs to touch down, in a series of \"hops\". Extremely strong and talented horses can perform five or more leaps forward before having to touch down with the forelegs, although it is more usual to see a series of three or four leaps. The courbette, like the capriole, is first introduced through the easier croupade.\n\nIn the mezair, the horse rears up and strikes out with its forelegs. It is similar to a series of levades with a forward motion (not in place), with the horse gradually bringing its legs further under himself in each successive movement and lightly touching the ground with the front legs before pushing up again. The mezair was originally called the courbette by the old dressage masters. It is no longer practiced at the Spanish Riding School.\n"}

It has unlimited jurisdiction within the territory in civil matters and hears the most serious criminal matters.\n\nThe Court has the jurisdictional power to hear matters that relate to the Jervis Bay Territory, the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Heard and McDonald Islands Territory, although it has never exercised that power. It also hears matters on appeal from the Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nWhilst the Supreme Court is the highest Australian Capital Territory court in the Australian court hierarchy, an appeal by special leave can be made to the High Court of Australia. Matters of appeal can also be submitted to the ACT Court of Appeal, which is constituted by members of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court consists of 5 permanent judges, including the Chief Justice of the Australian Capital Territory, presently Helen Murrell, 1 associate judge, 11 additional judges and 4 acting judges. The court has three main administrative units: Registry, Sheriff's Office and the Russell Fox Library.\n\nThe court is located on Knowles Place near London Circuit at Civic, in Canberra, in the new ACT Law Courts building that it shares with the Magistrates Court.\n\nWhen the Federal Capital Territory was created in 1911, all existing laws applicable in New South Wales applied equally to the new Territory. The Commonwealth soon began the implementation of a series of ordinances for the Territory's governance.\n\nIn the early years, Territory justice was enacted through the provisions of the \"Seat of Government Acceptance Act of 1909\". Territory officials relied on the Queanbeyan, Goulburn and Cooma courts. On 12 December 1925, the Federal Capital Commission wrote to the Department of Home Affairs and Territories about developing a system for the administration of justice in the Territory. It would be another five years, however, before any decisive action was taken, with the establishment of a Court of Petty Sessions in 1930.\n\nIn November 1932, Cabinet considered a report dealing with contemporary arrangements involving Territory courts. The report noted the High Court and Court of Petty Sessions, and that there had been a recent trial use of a visiting judge to hear criminal and civil matters. What was needed, the report said, was for the Territory to have its own Supreme Court. This would relieve the High Court of its jurisdiction in respect of the Territory and provide an intermediate court of appeal between the High Court and Court of Petty Sessions. Cabinet approved the recommendation on 7 December 1932.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Federal Capital Territory was established on 1 January 1934 by the .\n\nThe first judge of the Supreme Court was Lionel Lukin, who served from 1934 to 1943, and the court's first sitting was on 12 February 1934 at Acton House (the building was demolished in 1940). The court moved to the Hotel Acton in early 1935, then to the new Patent Office in Barton in 1941, and then to the Law Courts Building on the western side of City Hill, on 8 May 1963.\n\nFollowing the establishment of self-government in 1989, the court remained under Commonwealth administration until its transfer to the ACT Government on 1 July 1992, when the came into effect.\n\nBy 2006, the Supreme Court comprised a Chief Justice, three resident judges and (since 1958) additional judges otherwise appointed to the Federal Court of Australia as well as a Master of the Court.\n\nIn 2015, the title of the office of Master of the Supreme Court was changed to Associate Judge.\n\nIt was announced in 2017 that the ACT Law Courts building would be expanded as the Supreme Court was experience capacity issues. In 2019, stage one of the renovations were completed. Not only did the renovations bring the Magistrates Court and the Supreme Court into the same building, it added several new courtrooms and modernised facilities. Stage two and the renovations of the original ACT Law Courts building is due to be completed in coming years.\n\nIn addition to possessing jurisdictional power with respect to matters in the Australian Capital Territory, the Court also has the jurisdictional power to hear matters that relate to the Jervis Bay Territory, the Australian Antarctic Territory and the Heard and McDonald Islands Territory, although it has never exercised that power. It also hears matters on appeal from the Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nIt is the Territory's superior court with civil, criminal and appellate jurisdiction. It also covers matters relating to corporation law, adoptions and probate. The court also conducted divorce proceedings, but only until 1975, when the Family Court of Australia assumed responsibility for this function.\n\nThe court can be constituted by a single judge alone or with a jury. An appeal from the associate judge or from a single judge is heard by the court sitting as the ACT Court of Appeal constituted by three judges. An appeal from the Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory is heard by a single judge.\n\nPermanent judges are appointed by the executive. Additional judges are judges of other superior Australian courts (usually the Federal Court of Australia) that have been appointed as an additional judge of the Supreme Court.

The Chief Justice is responsible for the prompt discharge of the court’s business, and may in consultation with a judge, decide the types of cases which a magistrate will hear.\n\nCivil matters may be commenced by the filing of an originating application or originating process.\n\nCriminal matters are commenced when they persons are committed to trial or sentence by the Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nAppeals to the court may come from several sources including the Magistrates Court and the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal.\n\n"}
{"id": "1970945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970945", "title": "Freedom of contract", "text": "Freedom of contract\n\nFreedom of contract is the freedom of individuals and groups to form contracts without government restrictions. This is opposed to government regulations such as minimum-wage laws, competition laws, economic sanctions, restrictions on price fixing, or restrictions on contracting with undocumented workers. The freedom to contract is the underpinning of \"laissez-faire\" economics and is a cornerstone of free-market libertarianism. Through freedom of contract, individuals possess a general freedom to choose with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract.\n\nHenry James Sumner Maine proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from social status to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by Robert Nozick, sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a \"minimal state.\"\n\nIn 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to \"due process.\" Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the Supreme Court used the due process clause to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. Rufus Wheeler Peckham wrote for the majority: \"Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment.\"\n\nWriting in dissent, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. accused the majority of basing its decision on laissez-faire ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that \"Liberty of Contract\" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution.\n\nIn his \"Liberty of Contract\" (1909), Roscoe Pound critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were \"simply wrong\" from the standpoint of common law and \"even from that of a sane individualism\" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of usury and that the two were \"of the same type\" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such \"academic\" and \"artificial\" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a \"lost respect for the courts\" but predicted a \"bright\" future for labor legislation (486-487).\n\nThe Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\". In that case the court upheld a Washington state law setting a minimum wage.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused \"freedom of contract\" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in \"Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson\" by Sir George Jessel MR. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In \"George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd\", Lord Denning MR compared \"freedom of contract\" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.\n\nIn economics, the freedom of contract has been studied in the field of contract theory. According to the Coase Theorem, the freedom of contract is beneficial in the absence of transaction costs. When two rational parties voluntarily enter into a contract, they must be (at least weakly) better off than in the absence of the contract. The parties will agree on a contract that maximizes the total surplus that they can generate. Hence, restrictions on the class of enforceable contracts can only reduce the total surplus. Yet, prohibiting certain contracts can be beneficial when there are transaction costs. For example, Spier and Whinston (1995) have shown that not enforcing a contract between two parties can be desirable when the contract has negative external effects on a third party (which does not participate in the contract due to transaction costs). It has also been argued that the presence of asymmetric information can make restrictions on the freedom of contract desirable, since such restrictions can prevent inefficient distortions due to signalling and screening. Similarly, when there are transaction costs due to moral hazard problems, restrictions on the freedom of contract can be welfare-enhancing. Furthermore, it can be desirable not to enforce certain contracts when agents are susceptible to cognitive biases. Finally, an important problem is whether contractual parties should have the freedom to restrict their own freedom to modify their contract in the future. Schmitz (2005) and Davis (2006) argue that it can be beneficial not to enforce non-renegotiation clauses in contracts.\n\n\n\n"}

Two species are currently recognized, C. dilophidus in the Southeastern US and C. ohioensis in the rest of its range. C. leiseyorum was previously described from the Irvingtonian of Florida, but is now regarded as an invalid name. All species previously described as C. leiseyorum are considered to belong to C. dilophidus. \n\nSpecies of \"Castoroides\" were much larger than modern beavers. Their average length was approximately , and they could grow as large as . The weight of the giant beaver could vary from to . This makes it the largest known rodent in North America during the Pleistocene and the largest known beaver. However recent analyses suggest that they weighed some , but this is disputable.\n\nThe hind feet of the giant beaver were much larger than in modern beavers, while the hind legs were shorter. The tail was longer and possibly was not paddle-shaped as in modern beavers . It can only be assumed that its feet were webbed as in modern species. The skull structure of the giant beaver shows that it presumably participated in extended underwater activity, thanks to the ability to take in more oxygen into its lungs.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of the giant beaver was their incisors, which differ in size and shape from those of modern beavers. Modern beavers have incisor teeth with smooth enamel, while the teeth of the giant beaver were much larger up to long, with a striated, textured enamel surface.\n\nOne other major difference between the giant beaver and the modern beaver is that the size of its brain was proportionally smaller. As a result, the giant beaver may have had inferior interactions in its environment, as well as less complex patterns of thoughts and behavior.\n\nThere are two known species:\n\nThese two species of giant beaver (genus \"Castoroides\") are not close relatives to modern beavers (genus \"Castor\").\n\nThis genus typifies the extinct subfamily \"Castoroidinae\", which forms a North American lineage beginning with the Hemingfordian genus \"Monosaulax\", followed by \"Eucastor\", \"Dipoides\", and \"Procastoroides\", to finally culminate and go extinct with \"Castoroides\".\n\nThe \"Castoroides\" fossils were discovered in 1837 in a peat bog in Ohio, hence its species epithet \"ohioensis\". Catalogue no.1195, Mus. North. Ind. Hist. Soc. Well- preserved skull of \"Castoroides ohioensis\" but with the mandibles lost, both zygomatic arches missing, and the facial portions of the maxillae broken away; dental series complete and in good condition. \"Castoroides\" had cutting teeth up to 15 cm-long with prominently-ridged outer surfaces. These strong enamel ridges would have acted as girders to support such long teeth. Further, the deep masseteric fossa of the lower jaw suggests a very powerful bite. Perhaps their teeth could have acted as both wood-cutters and gouges. There is no clear evidence that the giant beaver felled trees or built dams, but a possible lodge was discovered near New Knoxville, Ohio around 1912. Part of a giant beaver skull and the lodge were located in a peaty layer surrounded by loam. In Ohio, there have been claims of a possible giant beaver lodge four feet high and eight feet in diameter, formed from small saplings. The recent discovery of clear evidence for lodge building in the related genus \"Dipoides\" indicates that the giant beaver probably also built lodges. Remains of the giant beaver, along with Paleo Indian artifacts and the remains of the flat-headed peccary, giant short-faced bear, and the stag moose were found in the Sheriden Cave in Wyandot County, Ohio.\nFossils of \"Castoroides\" are concentrated around the midwestern United States in states near the Great Lakes, particularly Illinois and Indiana, but specimens are recorded from Alaska and Canada to Florida. In Canada, fossils of this species are commonly found in the Old Crow Basin, Yukon, and single specimens are known from Toronto, Ontario and Indian Island, New Brunswick. A hitherto overlooked 1891 record of a \"Castoroides\" skull from near Highgate, Ontario is the earliest for Canada. In Old Crow region, \"Castoroides\" fossils occur in deposits of the Sangamonian interglacial.\n\nThe discovery of giant beaver remains in New Brunswick adds significantly to the Quaternary terrestrial mammal fauna of New Brunswick, and suggests that the terrestrial fauna was probably richer than earlier evidence indicated. The known North American distribution of giant beaver is not significantly changed by this occurrence. Specimens from the southeastern US have been placed in a separate species, \"Castoroides dilophidus\", based on differences in premolar and molar features. Martin (1969) considered it a suspecies, but new research by Hulbert et al. place them in their own species, \"Castoroides dilophidus.\", It is recorded from more than 25 Pleistocene localities in Florida, 23 of Rancholabrean age, one possibly of Irvingtonian age, and one of late Blancan age. \n\n\"Castoroides dilophidus\" specimens have been unearthed in Florida and South Carolina. The latter site (Cooper River) was dated at 1.8 million—11,000 years ago. The \"Castoroides leiseyorum\" was named by S. Morgan and J. A. White in 1995 for the Leisey shell pit .. Specimens were found in Leisey Shell Pit 1A and 3B, Hillsborough County, Florida, in paleontological sites about 2.1 Mya. These specimens are now considered to belong to C. dilophidus, C. leiseyorum is no longer a valid species name. Specimens were also found at the Strawberry Hill site, (Cooper River dredging) Charleston County, South Carolina from about 1.8 Mya to 11,000 years ago.\n\nFossils of the southeastern species, \"C. dilophidus\", and of \"C. ohioensis\" have been dated from 11,000 years to about 1.4 Mya. Specimens from Toronto, Ontario, and the Old Crow Basin, Yukon Territory, are 130,000 years old (with an occurrence of 60,000 years ago,) but \"Castoroides\" died out about 10,000 years ago, along with several other American species, such as mammoths, mastodons, and ice-age horses. No Alaska and Yukon Territory (AK–YT) fossils of the \"Castoroides\" have been recorded after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) about 18,000 years BP.\n\nThe extinction of the giant beaver may have been caused by ecological restructuring at the end of the Pleistocene. The arrival of humans in the Americas could have been a factor, but there is no evidence that humans hunted the giant beaver. It was one of the abundant Pleistocene megafauna—a wide variety of very large mammals that lived during the Pleistocene.\n\nEvidence from the lower Hudson Valley of New York shows that megafaunal populations collapsed many centuries in advance of the extinction event. At four localities (Otisville, Hyde Park, Binnewater Pond, and Pawelski Farm), the onset of the megafaunal population decline predates the Younger Dryas (at 12.9 cal ka BP). However, extinct megafauna (e.g., Castoroides) are securely dated to the very latest Pleistocene in nearby localities, indicating that population collapse preceded the actual extinction event. The timing of the population decline is of particular interest in that it predates a number of possible extinction mechanisms, including Younger Dryas climate change, the Clovis people and preexisting populations of indigenous peoples in North America, and the proposed extraterrestrial impact event. Sporormiella records from a sediment core recovered from Appleman Lake, Indiana show a pronounced decline in megafaunal populations during the Bølling–Allerød interstadial from 14.8 to 13.7 cal ka BP. Once again, this decline precedes the extinction for many taxa, indicating a population collapse well before the extinction event. A nutrient decelerating model suggests that as forage quality declines, herbivores must preferentially rely on those species with the highest nitrogen concentrations. Preferential feeding on plants with higher nitrogen concentrations tends to reduce plant litter quality, further limiting nitrogen availability in the soil. Over time, these feedback mechanisms decrease nitrogen availability, resulting in reduced forage production, decreased nitrogen concentrations, and reduced mammalian herbivore biomass.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1970966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970966", "title": "Christoph Schlingensief", "text": "Christoph Schlingensief\n\nChristoph Maria Schlingensief (24 October 1960 – 21 August 2010) was a German theatre director, performance artist and filmmaker. Starting as an independent underground filmmaker, Schlingensief later staged productions for theatres and festivals, often accompanied by public controversies. In the final years before his death, he staged Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival and worked at several opera houses, establishing himself as a \"Regietheater\" artist. He posthumously won the Golden Lion for Germany in 2011 at the Venice Biennale for the best national pavilion, which was turned into an installative replica of the stage design for his autobiographical play \"A Church of Fear VS. the Alien Within\", alluding to his cancer illness.\n\nSchlingensief was born on 24 October 1960 in Oberhausen. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a pediatric nurse. As a child, he worked as an altar server and already made short films with a hand-held camera.\n\nHaving passed his \"Abitur\" exams, he twice failed to gain admission to the University of Television and Film Munich. From 1981 he studied German language and literature, philosophy and art history at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, but also dabbled as a musician and finally dropped out in 1983 to work as an assistant to the experimental filmmaker Werner Nekes. After working as a teacher at Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach am Main and Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, he became a production manager on Hans W. Geißendörfer's TV series \"Lindenstraße\".\n\nAlready as a young man Schlingensief had organized art events in the cellar of his parents' house, and local artists such as Helge Schneider or Theo Jörgensmann performed in his early short films. He considered himself a 'provocatively thoughtful' artist. He created numerous controversial and provocative theatre pieces as well as films, his former mentor being filmmaker and media artist Werner Nekes.\n\nAlready Schlingensief's debut feature film, the surreal, absurd experimental \"Tunguska – Die Kisten sind da!\" (\"Tunguska – The Crates Are Delivered!\", 1984) was well received by critics. Growing up in the shadow of the New German Cinema, Schlingensief was deeply influenced by the likes of Rainer Werner Fassbinder—many members of whose stock company of actors such as Udo Kier, Margit Carstensen, Irm Hermann or Volker Spengler became regulars in Schlingensief's films—or Alexander Kluge, with whom he collaborated on numerous occasions. To said period of film, Schlingensief delivered both a heartfelt homage as well as the final coup de grâce with \"The 120 Days of Bottrop\"—starring Helmut Berger, playing an inept director's effort to remake Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" (1975)—in much the same way he dealt with German avant-garde cinema 15 years earlier with his first feature film \"Tunguska – The Crates Are Delivered\" starring . Drawing parallels to the work of British filmmaker Derek Jarman, \"Egomania – Island without Hope\" (1986) starred Kier and Tilda Swinton. Other influences include Luis Buñuel, Werner Schroeter or Herbert Achternbusch—and Schlingensief's filmic works have been compared to just as wide a range of filmmakers, from Jean-Luc Godard to Russ Meyer.\n\nWith his \"Germany Trilogy\", consisting of \"100 Years of Adolf Hitler – The Last Hour in the Führerbunker\", \"The German Chainsaw Massacre – The First Hour of the Reunification\" and \"Terror 2000 – Germany out of Control\", Schlingensief came to prominence. Since then he shaped the cultural and political discourse in Germany for more than two decades and established himself as one of the country's most important and versatile artists. The \"Germany Trilogy\" deals with three turning points in 20th-century German history: the first movie \"Hundert Jahre Adolf Hitler\" (\"A Hundred Years of Adolf Hitler\", 1989) covers the last hours of Adolf Hitler, the second \"The German Chainsaw Massacre\" (1990), depicts the German reunification of 1990 and shows a group of East Germans who cross the border to visit West Germany and get slaughtered by a psychopathic West German family with chainsaws, and the third \"Terror 2000\" (1992) focuses on xenophobic violence after the reunification process.\n\nOne of Schlingensief's central tactics was to call politicians' bluff in an attempt to reveal the inanities of their \"responsible\" discourse, a tactic he called \"playing something through to its end\". This strategy was most notable in his work \"Please Love Austria\" (alternately named \"Foreigners out! Schlingensiefs Container\") at the time of the FPÖ and ÖVP coalition in Austria, a work which attracted international support, a media frenzy and countless debates about art practice.\n\nIn 2009, he joined the jury of the Berlin International Film Festival under Tilda Swinton.\n\nSchlingensief soon became a figure of considerable celebrity and notoriety in Germany, thanks to several popular television projects. Broadcast in 1997, \"Talk 2000\" was a talk show with celebrity guests in which Schlingensief sometimes interrupted interviews to discuss his own personal problems. In \"U3000\" (2000), he and his crew were filmed acting crazily on platforms and in cars of the Berlin subway system; the program aired on MTV Germany. In \"Freakstars 3000\" (2003), a six-part \"American Idol\"-style parody, two dozen people from an assisted-living home for the mentally disabled competed for spots in a new band.\n\nIn 1997, Schlingesief staged an art action at the documenta X exhibition in Kassel as part of the performance space \"Hybrid WorkSpace,\" which was curated by Klaus Biesenbach, Nancy Spector and Hans-Ulrich Obrist. During the performance, Schlingensief was arrested for carrying a placard with the words \"Kill Helmut Kohl!\". In November 1999, invited by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center and organized by Klaus Biesenbach, Schlingensief carried out a performance at the Statue of Liberty in New York City, where, kneeling down at the foot of the statue, he handed Germany over to globalization.\n\nHis exhibition \"The Last Hour\", with its twisted metalwork from a crashed car, footage of a long tunnel and paparazzi pictures of Princess Diana, was in 2006 rejected by the Frieze Art Fair in London's Regent's Park and instead ended up in a little-known gallery space in Bethnal Green. He later joined the Hauser & Wirth gallery. In 2007, the Haus der Kunst, Munich, mounted an exhibition of Schlingensief's work; it presented \"African Twin Towers\" and short films that have been shot while the artist directed \"The Flying Dutchman\" at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil.\n\nIn the 1990s, Schlingensief directed a series of chaotic, satirical productions at the Volksbühne theatre in Berlin. He also directed a version of \"Hamlet\", subtitled, \"This is your Family, Nazi~Line\", which premiered in Switzerland, the so-called neutral territory equated with the Denmark of the opening line in Shakespeare's play where there is something foul afoot. Events around the piece questioned and attacked Switzerland's 'neutrality' in the face of growing racism and extreme right wing movements. The artist duo Ubermorgen provided the Internet platform \"Nazi~Line\" for the project, where former members of Neo Nazi groups were sought and then cast as actors to play characters in the drama on stage as a way of re-integrating the ex-Neo-Nazis with the common workforce of the theatre.\n\nSchlingensief's work covered a variety of media, including installation and the ubiquitous 'talk show' and has in many cases led to audience members leaving the theatre space with Schlingensief and his colleagues to take part in events such as \"Passion Impossible, Wake Up Call for Germany\" 1997 or \"Chance 2000, Vote for Yourself\" in which he formed the \"Last Chance Party\" where anyone could become a candidate themselves in the run up to the federal election of 1998 in Germany. The same year he made a performance project for an Austrian Festival for new art Steirischer Herbst called \"Chance 2000 for Graz\": eight pillars were built at the central Marienplatz square, where homeless people were invited to sit on, and the deal was that the one who sat there longest could win 7,000 shillings, plus every day the artist threw 20,000 shillings on passers-by in front of the eyes of those who sat on the pillars. The project was interrupted with help of the right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, that collected 10,000 signatures against it.\n\nWith his demands for people to \"prove they exist\" in an age of total TV coverage and \"act, act, act\" in the sense of becoming active not 'actors', his work could be considered a direct legacy of Bertolt Brecht, as it demands involvement as opposed to passivity and merely looking on as is the case in traditional text-based theatre. In an age of extreme media fatigue, his was a fresh voice albeit and undisputedly containing echoes of the past, often humorous and subversive yet never cynical. His influences included Joseph Beuys and his idea of social sculpture, and artists Allan Kaprow and Dieter Roth. At the time of his death, he was involved in productions for the Ruhrtriennale and for the Berlin Staatsoper's \"Metanoia\".\n\nIn 2004, at the invitation of Wolfgang and Katharina Wagner and to rave reviews, he staged Richard Wagner's \"Parsifal\" for the Bayreuth Festival. When he accepted the Wagner family's invitation, it caused surprise because of his iconoclasm and his well-known aversion to all things tainted by association with Hitler; however, he had been invited to the festival before in 1991. Film clips and costumes focused the action on the conflict between Christianity and Islam. The production, in the first years conducted by Pierre Boulez, was revived in 2005 and 2006, but unlike other Bayreuth Festival stagings it was not filmed. Christian Kracht would later describe \"the likes of Wolfgang Wagner\" as \"bourgeois & enemy to Christoph Schlingensief.\"\n\nIn his last productions, such as the fluxus oratorio \"Church of Fear\" and the ready made opera \"Mea culpa\", he staged his own cancer experience, and related it to his first 'stage experience' as a young altar boy.\n\nSchlingensief's commitment to developing nations later took him to Burkina Faso, where he was awarded a concession to build an opera house, arguably his most ambitious project. The project, which received funding from the German government, was also to include a theater and film school, and an infirmary. Construction began in January 2010, near Ouagadougou, and was later continued under the guidance of Schlingensief's wife and long-time assistant Aino Laberenz, whom he married in 2009. In 2012, numerous internationally renowned artists have donated works for a fundraising auction at the Hamburger Bahnhof, among them Marina Abramović, Pipilotti Rist, Georg Baselitz, Christo, Olafur Eliasson, Andreas Gursky, Wolfgang Tillmans and Günther Uecker. Patti Smith, a friend of Schlingensief for many years, contributed a drawing that she made in the summer of 2010 during a joint exhibition in Munich.\n\nAfter learning he had lung cancer in early 2008, Schlingensief wrote about his illness and in 2009 published \"Heaven Could Not Be as Beautiful as Here: A Cancer Diary.\" Also, he already organised part of his estate and entrusted it for archiving to the Berlin Academy of the Arts. He died on August 21, 2010 in Berlin, Germany at age 49.\nIn a note to his death in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Literature Nobel Prize Laureate Elfriede Jelinek wrote:\n\n\"Schlingensief was one of the greatest artists who ever lived. I always thought one like him cannot die. It is as if life itself had died. He was not really a stage director (in spite of Bayreuth and Parsifal), he was everything: he was the artist as such. He has coined a new genre that has been removed from each classification. There will be nobody like him.\"\n\nIn 2011, the jury of the 54th Venice Biennale awarded the international exhibition's highest honor, the \"Golden Lion for best national pavilion\", to Germany for its display of work by Christoph Schlingensief. Organized by curator Susanne Gaensheimer, who completed the exhibition after Schlingensief's death, the German pavilion was transformed into a replica of the church where the artist spent his teenage years as an altar boy in order to present \"Fluxus Oratorio,\" the second of his three-part final work, created after he had undergone surgery to remove a lung. The exhibition presented multimedia documents—from videos to x-rays—relating to his battle with terminal cancer. A side room showed footage and a maquette made as part of Schlingensief's project to build an opera house in Burkina Faso, while another wing displayed a selection of films from throughout his career. In an interview with Berliner Zeitung, artist Gerhard Richter had previously criticised Schlingensief's appointment as \"a scandal\", associating the selection of the multitasking director with \"the decline of painting.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Sir Lancelot played a major role in popularizing calypso in North America, and Harry Belafonte has acknowledged him as an inspiration and major influence.\n\nPinard was born in Cumuto, Trinidad. His father, Donald Pinard, was a wealthy government official and Anglophile. Pinard attended exclusive parochial schools and his family regularly attended the opera (which gave him an informal musical education). He began singing traditional German lieder and Italian arias. He studied to be a pharmacist as a young man, and his family sent him to New York City to study medicine. After hearing a concert by the African-American lyric tenor Roland Hayes he gave up his medical education to study singing and music, and soon was performing classical works. He began including calypso in his performances, and eventually became a full-time calypso singer. About this time, he met the Trinidadian band leader Gerald Clark, perhaps the most significant promoter of calypso in New York City. Clark asked him to record some calypso songs, and Pinard agreed. He made his debut as Sir Lancelot in 1940 at New York City's Village Vanguard nightclub. He was a close friend of the photographer Seema Aissen Weatherwax, who took some of his first publicity photos.\n\nSir Lancelot became a regular at the Village Vanguard, and by the 1940s \"was widely considered the hottest calypsonian in the city.\" His trademark became the tuxedo he wore in nearly every concert, and his popularity was nationwide for two decades. In the 1940s he returned home for the first time but was largely disowned by his family, which felt that his calypso singing had shamed them. Sir Lancelot wrote the calypso song \"Shame & Scandal\" (also known as \"Fort Holland\") in response.\n\nSir Lancelot toured with Lionel Belasco in California and Oregon in 1941. After a show in Los Angeles, he was offered a minor singing role in the picture \"Two Yanks in Trinidad\" (Columbia Pictures, 1942). His appearance was made possible by the Oscar-winning performance of Hattie McDaniel in \"Gone with the Wind\" just two years earlier. He made more than 15 films, and his significant film appearances include:\n\nIn the 1940s, Sir Lancelot made numerous records (signing with Apollo Records), and sang in commercials. He also composed a score for the 1948 motion picture, \"Tarzan and the Mermaids\". He allegedly made millions of dollars selling calypso records, and spent most of it.\n\nSir Lancelot was politically active for much of his life. After hearing Henry A. Wallace's \"century of the common man\" speech on May 8, 1942, Sir Lancelot composed the \"Common Man\" calypso song. Wallace later wrote him a long letter of thanks. He composed several popular calypso songs with left-wing lyrics in the 1940s, including \"Defenders of Stalingrad\" and \"Walk in Peace\" (1946). His stand on war and peace issues was so well known that a cartoon version of him appeared in Columbia Pictures' 1944 animated short film, \"The Disillusioned Bluebird\" (in which the calypso-singing character tells a bluebird that the world will not always be at war). According to Pete Seeger, the 1948 Lead Belly song \"Equality for Negroes\" was inspired by a Sir Lancelot song. Sir Lancelot became a U.S. citizen in 1960.\n\nSir Lancelot spent six years touring in Europe in the 1950s, which negatively impacted his career in the U.S. Sir Lancelot's last film appearance was in 1958 (with Yul Brynner in \"The Buccaneer\"), although he made a noted appearance in an episode of \"The Andy Griffith Show\" in 1967. Through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, he recorded several \"Gospel calypso\" songs. He was widely popular in Europe into the late 1960s. His popularity in the U.S. at the time was still strong enough that Sherwood Schwartz used Sir Lancelot's musical style as inspiration for the original theme song to the television program \"Gilligan's Island\" and nearly had Sir Lancelot sing the theme. His music, too, endured, with Lord Melody covering \"Shame and Scandal\" in the 1960s. He continued to work as a musician until at least 1973, briefly coming out of retirement in the 1980s to perform at McCabe's Guitar Shop (Los Angeles) with Van Dyke Parks, Ry Cooder and other musicians. He also performed and recorded with Steven Springer, Arizona-based band Sanctuary, and his nephew Brian Pinard, recording his last album under the name \"Knights of the Holy Trinity,\" with his last recording being \"Pinardhymns – Religious Calypso.\" \n\nSir Lancelot was a Roman Catholic who married and had three daughters. He spent his last years in Australia with his nephew, Brian Pinard.\n\nSir Lancelot died of natural causes in Anaheim, California and is buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\n\n"}

They briefly served as part of the Alliance government, alongside the Liberal Party and Residents Rally.\n\nWhen the 1989 election was held, the No Self-Government Party emerged as the larger of the two anti-self-government groups in the Assembly, electing three members, Craig Duby, Carmel Maher and David Prowse. However, unlike Dennis Stevenson's Abolish Self-Government Coalition, the No Self-Government Party's focus soon began to change from their original single-issue basis.\n\nThe first vote of the new Assembly saw Prowse voted in as the Speaker by the members. In late 1989, Residents Rally, who were supporting the Follett Labor government, began discussions aimed at forming a coalition government with the Liberals. They then turned to the No Self-Government Party, who accepted the offer. However, as opposition to self-government itself was a core basis of their party, and it would have been seen as somewhat odd for them to then join a government, Duby, and Maher disbanded the party, and reformed as the Independents Group. Prowse joined the Liberal party in July 1990. The new party then became the third member of the Alliance government, and Duby, the old party's former leader, became Minister for Urban Services. Prowse retained his position as Speaker.\n\nWhilst Duby was a vocal member of the government, and was often heard in the Assembly and media, Maher tended to be a less significant player in ACT politics. Nevertheless, the party were vital in sustaining the Alliance government for its eighteen-month lifespan. As long as the Alliance survived, however, they nevertheless maintained influence in decision-making. This was to end when the Liberal Party and Residents Rally fell out in late 1991, causing Residents Rally to move a no-confidence motion in the government. The Follett Labor government with Residents Rally and independents support returned to power. Prowse retained the Speakership.\n\nSoon after, on November 19, realising that the Independents Group was effectively dead, Duby quit the party to form the Hare-Clark Independent Party. With her influence in the Assembly reduced to practically nil, Maher continued under the Independents Group until the 1992 election. Both Maher and Prowse retired at the election, and though Duby contested the election with his new party, he lost his seat. By the 1995 election, the Independents Group was entirely dead, with none its members playing any further role in ACT politics.\n"}

A painter also named \"Giovanni da Udine\" was exiled from his native city in 1472.\nAs a student and assistant of Raphael, he was responsible for most of the \"decorative\" (i.e. non-narrative) elements of the major Raphaellesque projects in Rome, and he was a specialist in fresco and stucco grotesque decorations. These included the stucco work in the Loggia di Raffaello (Vatican, 1517–1519) and the heavy fruit-laden wreaths in the \"loggia di psiche\" in the Villa Farnesina. He also assisted in the construction of a few monumental fountains, which are now destroyed. He is also known for his drawings of birds and fruit.\n\nOne of his well-known discoveries is the art of Stucco, that Giovanni was the \"new-founder\" of after antiquity: occasioned by the discovery of the \"Domus Aurea\", Nero's residence near the Colosseum: in the first year of the 16th century Raphael and his students went down \"\"Mons Coelius\"\" into tunnels that were formed to explore that area. With candles and torches they explored the caves and looked at the walls onto which were painted little heavy coloured figures that were named \"\"grottesche (pl.), grottesca (s.)\"\" because in the darkness, these images seemed like paint in ancient caves that in Italian was -and is- said like above. There was a strange \"pictorial relief\" onto which some of this \"grottesche\" were realised: it was Roman stucco, an important technique that the ancient Romans utilised to reproduce a marble effect, real marble was already too expensive by that time even for the Imperator (we have to think that there were all a \"\"Domus\"\" in marble, for a size as like as a range of KM 1.5 - 2 around Colosseum, it was the most famous residence of the Roman Empire).\n\nAfter the death of Raphael, da Udine continued to work on projects initiated by his master, namely the Villa Madama in Rome.

Entering service in 1943, the ship saw action during World War II, participating in the Battle of Tarawa. Following the war the destroyer was placed in reserve, remaining in this state until 1972. She was sold for scrap in 1974.\n\n\"Schroeder\" was laid down on 25 June 1942 by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 11 November 1942, sponsored by Miss Grace Wainwright Schroeder. The destroyer was commissioned on 1 January 1943, Commander J. T. Bowers in command.\n\n\"Schroeder\" provided escort for two separate aircraft carriers making shakedown cruises to the Caribbean and a convoy of merchant ships bound for Casablanca before steaming to the Pacific.\n\nAfter an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, she steamed west and joined Destroyer Squadron 25 (DesRon 25) at Pearl Harbor on 28 July 1943. \"Schroeder\" assisted in screening the carrier task force which attacked Marcus Island on 1 September. While bombarding Wake Island early the next month, she was taken under fire for the first time but suffered no casualties.\n\nAfter the Wake Island bombardment, \"Schroeder\" sailed to the New Hebrides Islands for training with amphibious forces. In early November, she joined the Gilbert Islands invasion force. On the morning of 20 November, \"Schroeder\" was in the bombardment group that shelled the eastern coast of Tarawa Atoll. She entered the lagoon early the next morning to provide fire support for the Marines landing on Tarawa. In addition to fire support, the destroyer also acted as a first aid ship for wounded Marines. \"Schroeder\" departed Tarawa on 24 November for Pearl Harbor for repairs, as she had damaged her screws on a coral reef in the lagoon.\n\n\"Schroeder\" was back with her division, on 1 February 1944, when it screened transports and provided fire support for the assault on Kwajalein Island. She remained in the Marshalls for several weeks and, from 20 to 24 February, bombarded Maloelap and Wotje Atolls. On 1 March, she sailed to the New Hebrides Islands where she participated in more training exercises.\n\nOn 20 March, \"Schroeder\" and her division bombarded Japanese coast defenses at Kavieng, New Ireland, with nearly 900 rounds of ammunition; departing for Efate in the evening.\n\n\"Schroeder\" loaded ammunition at Espiritu Santo and on 1 April, escorted \"Pocomoke\" and SS \"Red Rover\" to Guadalcanal; joined a merchant convoy there, and escorted it to Milne Bay, New Guinea. Later in the month, she participated in the bombardment of enemy positions at Hollandia; and, then screened transports and LSTs at Humboldt Bay. She performed fighter director duties until 30 April when she departed with a convoy for Cape Sudest and, later, to Buna.\n\n\"Schroeder\" operated in the Purvis Bay-Guadalcanal area until she departed for Kwajalein, on 4 June, as a unit of Task Group 53.1 (TG 53.1). The TG was at Eniwetok on 28 June where \"Schroeder\" underwent a period of upkeep and logistics.\n\nOn 11 July the DD and her division departed for the Mariana Islands. From 16 to 20 July, the division bombarded the Tumon area of Guam. \"Schroeder\" then served on picket duty until 4 August when she escorted a convoy back to Eniwetok. After returning to Espiritu Santo for a period of upkeep and logistics, she sailed for Humboldt Bay on 22 August.\n\n\"Schroeder\" was assigned to TG 77.5 which sortied, on 13 September, for the invasion of Morotai, Netherlands East Indies. She screened LSTs in their approach to Pitoe Bay and then served on picket duty until departing for Humboldt Bay on 21 September.\n\nThe destroyer sailed, on 13 October, with TF 78 for Panoan Island, P.I. She entered Leyte Gulf at midnight, 19 October, with a group of transports, and, the next morning, began performing ASW and fighter director duties. On 25 October, she withdrew from the area and sailed for San Francisco. She arrived there on 23 November and underwent a period of overhaul and availability.\n\nOn 11 January 1945, \"Schroeder\" moved down the coast to San Diego. Departing there on 20 January, the veteran destroyer was back in Ulithi on 7 February where she joined TF 58, the Fast Carrier Task Force. The task force sortied on 10 February. On 16 and 17 February, the carriers launched attacks against airfields, aircraft factories, and shipping in the Tokyo area. The next day, the flattops launched strikes against the Volcano Islands in preparation for the forthcoming assault against that Japanese bastion.\n\n\"Schroeder\" returned to Ulithi in early March, but, by 23 March, was again operating off the Japanese home islands. Detached from the task group on 31 March, she and proceeded to Ulithi. She sailed from there on 10 April as a unit of TG 50.8, which was proceeding to Okinawa to support the landings there. On 16 April, the destroyer, supporting the landing on Ie Shima, was at general quarters nine different times to repel enemy air attacks. Five days later, \"Schroeder\" with DesDiv 49, bombarded the western side of Minami Daito Shima. The bombardment caused many fires ashore but brought no return gunfire from the enemy positions.\n\n\"Schroeder\" returned to Ulithi, from 27 April to 9 May, for a period of upkeep, replenishment, and recreation. She rejoined the fast carriers three days later as they conducted bombing and photographic missions over Kyūshū. Four days later, they supported the troops on southern Okinawa.\n\nTask Force 58 entered San Pedro Bay, on 13 June for an upkeep period. It sortied on 1 July, and, on 10 July, the carriers launched sustained strikes against Tokyo. On 17–18 July, strikes were launched against targets in the Tokyo-Yokohama area. On 31 July \"Schroeder\" shelled Shimizu, Honshū Island.\n\nOn 6 September, with hostilities ended, the task force entered Tokyo Bay and dissolved its units. \"Schroeder\" was ordered to join TF 11 at Okinawa and proceed to Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 1 October, with orders assigning her to the east coast. On 2 November 1945, the destroyer entered the Charleston Navy Yard, South Carolina, and prepared for deactivation.\n\n\"Schroeder\" was decommissioned on 29 April 1946 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained in reserve until 1 October 1972 when she was struck from the Navy List. \"Schroeder\" was sold to Southern Materials Co., Ltd., New Orleans, Louisiana, on 1 January 1974.\n\"Schroeder\" received 10 battle stars for World War II service.\n\n"}

{"id": "1971055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971055", "title": "Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality", "text": "Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality\n\nCaptain Comic II: Fractured Reality is the 1990 sequel to the 1988 MS-DOS platform game, \"The Adventures of Captain Comic\". The game was created by the same author as the original, Michael Denio, working at Color Dreams and was published by ComputerEasy.\n\nThe game was not as successful as its predecessor, despite containing numerous improvements and new features:\n\nUnlike the original (which was shareware), the game was sold commercially.\n\nCaptain Comic II is a platform game and like its predecessor has the concepts of shield points (health), lives, a score, items, enemies, zones and objectives.\n\nThe primary health indicator is the shield. Once the shield points are exhausted by coming into contact with enemy units and then he is struck again (or if he is hit for more damage than his remaining shields), Comic loses a life. Additionally, if Comic falls off the bottom of a screen a life is lost. If Comic finds a bonus shield it will restore the points to maximum, or add the shield to his inventory for later use if already at full. The game is over when Comic loses all of his lives (or completes the main objective of the game).\n\nBonus items can generally be found in strategic locations or inside boxes or crates that need to be opened up or destroyed by use of the pick-axe tool (one of the first goals of the game should therefore be to obtain the pick-axe). Items range from gems (points), shields (health), mini-Comics (bonus lives), to tools that can be used for other purposes. A notable addition is the magic wand which can turn some useless items into useful items, ranging from powerups to keys. Generally, items also add to the game score when collected. One new feature in this version of the game is the ability to change \"active\" it (perhaps a requirement since there are now many more items to collect and use). For example, the primary item in use is the firing weapon, but when it is time to use the pick-axe tool (or key, or screwdriver, etc.), Comic can select that item from his inventory.\n\nComic must also avoid or destroy various enemies in the game, primarily by use of his firepower which he obtains by collecting Blastola Cola (again, one of the first goals early in the game should be to acquire this item - of which there are 6 in total). Enemies range from simple units on pre-set paths to more difficult combatants that follow Comic or seek him out directly. Some enemies move faster than others, and most are restricted to their domain (fish enemies in water, for example). All enemies have the same general property in that when they come in contact with Comic they are destroyed, but reduce his shield points accordingly (from one to four shield points depending on the enemy, as opposed to two regardless of type in Captain Comic). Destroying enemy units by shooting them also increases the game score (100 to 400 points, depending on how many shield points would normally be deducted - note that some enemies cannot be destroyed by shooting them). Coming into contact with one of the temple masters also results in death.\n\nThe game is divided into major areas, each with smaller zones. Passing from one zone or area into another marks a safe point (although this version of the game also has a save-game feature). Typically areas are identified by the presence of doorways, which require the correct key (in the previous Episode one key opened all doors; in this Episode there are multiple keys denoted by color or design).\n\nComic can complete the main objective in the game, by successfully navigating areas and obtaining items (particularly tools) in what can be viewed as smaller objectives. For example, Comic must find the local leader to get the storyline, but also direction on obtaining the 'Temple Key' as a first objective. But there is also the side effect of learning where to acquire the pick-axe (from the guys working on the Escape Pods). As Comic works his way through the stages of the game, he collects more and better items to help with the increasingly difficult areas (particularly with regard to the enemies he must face).\n\nThe game opens with this screen of text:\n\nIn the game, Comic must find a machine which allows him to travel to six different realities, in which he must collect the six crystals to save the planet and its inhabitants from evil aliens known as the \"Skrejgib\" (which, backwards, reads \"Big Jerks\").\n"}

Laycock was thus a half-brother of the 7th ; their sister Josephine (died 1958) married Edward Greenall, 2nd Lord Daresbury, and is grandmother of the present Baron. Through his father's relationship with the married Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, issue occurring before and during his marriage with Kitty, Robert Laycock was half-brother to the Countess of Warwick's son Maynard Greville (1898-1960), and daughter, Mercy Greville (1904-1968).\n\nLaycock was educated at Lockers Park School and Eton College, followed by officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he emerged as a well-read young man with a scientific bent. He also briefly worked in a factory.\n\nIn 1927, he was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards. He served in the Second World War as a lieutenant-colonel with the commandos in North Africa, Crete, Sicily and Italy before being promoted to major-general and becoming Chief of Combined Operations in 1943. He held that position until 1947.\nSee Layforce\n\nIn 1954, his old friend, Anthony Head, now Secretary of State for War appointed Laycock to the position of Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta. This was during a period of tensions surrounding a drive for independence, with Prime Minister Dom Mintoff leading a campaign for \"Integration (with Britain) or Self-Determination\", and the Nationalist Party looking for a \"Quasi-Dominion Status. Prior to his assuming the position of Governor, Queen Elizabeth knighted Laycock in the drawing room of Sledmere House, Yorkshire whilst staying as fellow house guests of Sir Richard Sykes, Baronet. Laycock served until 1959, having had his term extended twice.\n\nLaycock suffered from severe circulatory problems, which meant constant pain in one leg. \n\nHe was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in 1962. \n\nA noted horseman, yachtsman and historical book collector, his interests made him a man who could enjoy life. It was said by many he had no enemies. \n\nWhile walking back from Sunday church services on 10 March 1968, Laycock suffered a massive heart attack and died. \n\nHis estate was probated at £279,910.\n\nLaycock was married in 1935 to Claire Angela Louise Dudley Ward (1916–1999) younger daughter of the Right Honourable William Dudley Ward, Liberal MP for Southampton by his wife Freda Dudley Ward née Winifred May Birkin, granddaughter of Sir Thomas Isaac Birkin, 1st Baronet.

It is primarily used to treat atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and psoriasis in both adults and children. It has a fairly good safety profile and is available as a cream, ointment, lotion, and as a foam under the tradename Verdeso Foam. Other trade names for creams, lotions, and ointments include Tridesilon, DesOwen, Desonate. It is a group VI corticosteroid under US classification, the second least potent group.\n\nDesonide is a prescription topical treatment for redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort of various skin conditions. Regardless of the vehicle used, desonide is applied 2 to 3 times a day, at the same times each day. Skin conditions typically improve in the first two weeks of treatment. Patients are instructed to use desonide for the minimum amount of time necessary for conditions to improve.\n\nThe safety of desonide has not been determined beyond 4 weeks of use. Patients with allergies to corticosteroids (like hydrocortisone or prednisone) should use caution when taking desonide. Pharmacists and prescribing physicians should be aware that this medication may contain inactive ingredients than can cause allergic reactions.\n\nDesonide should not be used if there is an infection or open wound in the treatment area.\n\nSystemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce adverse effects. Indication of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria have been observed in some patients receiving treatment. After stopping treatment, reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency is possible. The cosyntropin (ACTH1-24) laboratory test can evaluate patients for HPA axis suppression. HPA function can be reversed after the cessation of treatment or replacement with another less potent corticosteroid. If glucocorticosteroid insufficiency occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be required.\n\nSide effects of desonide requiring immediate contact with the prescribing physician:\n\nSide effects that may go away as the body adjusts to the medication:\n\nThe FDA has labeled desonide as pregnancy category C. Desonide should only be used during pregnancy when absolutely necessary.\n\nIt is currently unknown whether topical application of Desonide can pass into breast milk. Similar drugs taken orally have been seen to pass into breast milk. The prescribing doctor should be consulted prior to breast-feeding.\n\nDesonide is a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid; topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of these properties, however, is unclear for the dermal route of administration. Following absorption through the skin, corticosteroids follow pharmacokinetic pathways similarly to intravenously administered corticosteroids. The mechanism of corticosteroids is thought to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Lipocortins control the biosynthesis of inflammation mediators, like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Lipocortins can inhibit the common precursor of inflammation mediators, arachidonic acid.\n\nCommon medications causing a minor negative drug interaction include: Insulin and Metformin. Common medications checked in combination, but that are not known to create a negative drug interaction, include: Aspirin, Cymbalta (duloxetine), Fish Oil, Acetaminophen, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Zyrtec.\n\nDesonide was first introduced in the United States under the trade name Tridesilon by Dome Laboratories in 1970. Since the discovery in the United States, several other countries have introduced different brand names of desonide, including Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Germany. The FDA first approved Connetics Corporation’s Verdeso Foam®\non September 16, 2006. Just shortly after, the FDA approved SkinMedica Inc.’s\nDesonate® hydrogel delivery vehicle on October 20, 2006.\n\nDesonate® gel is currently manufactured by Bayer HealthCare\nPharmaceuticals Inc. in Whippany, NJ. DesOwen® creams, ointments, and lotions\nare currently manufactured by DPT Laboratories, Ltd. in San Antonio Texas and\nis marketed by Galderma Laboratories. Other suppliers for the generic desonide\ninclude Rebel Distributors Corp and Perrigo New York Inc.\n\nDesonate was approved by the FDA following two major clinical trials in 2006. Each randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 582 pediatric patients (between the ages of 3 months and 18 years). The patient was topically administered the drug or placebo two times a day for four weeks. Using the Investigator’s Global Severity Score (IGSS), the treatment was considered successful if at Week 4 there was at least a two (2) point decrease from the patient’s baseline IGSS. In clinical trial 1, 44% of patients succeeded successful treatment of Desonate versus 14% treated with the placebo. In clinical trial 2, 28% of patients succeeded successful treatment of Desonate versus 6% treated with the placebo.\n\nThe FDA approved Tridesilon for the following treatments: Contact Dermatitis, Rhus Dermatitis, Eczema, Dermatitis, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, Granuloma Annulare, Seborrheic Dermatitis, Polymorphous Light Eruption, Pruritus, Psoriasis, Lichen Simplex, Atopic Dermatitis, Lichen Planus, Xerosis, Exfoliative Dermatitis.\n\nRecently, in late 2014, phase 3 clinical trials were completed to evaluate treatments using Desonide cream versus amino acid moisturizing cream. Patients with eczema or atopic dermatitis could be enrolled in this study, both male and female, over the age of 18. The randomized, double-blind, active control, 5-week study compared the effects of treatment of both creams through twice-a-day application. The clinical trial is sponsored by NeoStrata Company, Inc.\n\nNo research has been completed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photoco-carcinogenic potential of desonide. Additionally, no research has been completed to determine the effect on fertility. These are current opportunities for improvement to learn more about the risks and benefits associated with desonide.\n\nThe first US. patent for desonide was US4185100A was granted on January 22, 1980. The patent was for topical anti-inflammatory treatment using desonide. The patent defends the suitability of the anti-inflammatory for the treatment of cutaneous disorders or disruptions characterized by skin inflammation and/or hyperproliferative activity in the epidermis. Side effects and the mechanism of action are both disclosed. This patent is currently expired.\n\nDesonide topical cream and ointment is sold in 15g and 60g tubes of %0.05 gel, and desonide lotion is sold in 2 fluid ounce bottles.

{"id": "1971075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971075", "title": "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld", "text": "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld\n\nWesley Newcomb Hohfeld (9 August 1879, Oakland, California21 October 1918, Alameda, California) was an American jurist. He was the author of the seminal \"Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays\" (1919).\n\nDuring his life he published only a handful of law journal articles. After his death the material forming the basis of \"Fundamental Legal Conceptions\" was derived from two articles in the \"Yale Law Journal\" (1913) and (1917) that had been partially revised with a view to publication. Editorial work was undertaken to complete the revisions and the book was published with the inclusion of the manuscript notes that Hohfeld had left, plus seven other essays.\n\nThe work remains a powerful contribution to modern understanding of the nature of rights and the implications of liberty. To reflect Hohfeld's continuing importance, a chair at Yale University is named after him. The chair is currently occupied by Gideon Yaffe as of 2019 and was last held by Jules Coleman, who retired in 2012.\n\nWesley Newcomb Hohfeld was born in California in 1879. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1901. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he served as editor of the \"Harvard Law Review\", and graduated in 1904 with honors.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1913 Hohfeld taught at Stanford Law School. He then moved to Yale Law School, where he taught until his death in 1918.\n\nJurisprudence is the branch of philosophy which deals with principles of law and the legal systems through which the law is applied. Hohfeld's contribution was to simplify; he created a very precise analysis which distinguished between fundamental legal concepts and then identified the framework of relationships between them. His work offers a sophisticated method for deconstructing broad legal principles into their component elements. By showing how legal relationships are connected to each other, the resulting analysis illuminates policy implications and identifies the issues which arise in practical decision making.\n\nHohfeld noticed that even respected jurists conflate various meanings of the term \"right\", sometimes switching senses of the word several times in a single sentence. He wrote that such imprecision of language indicated a concomitant imprecision of thought, and thus also of the resulting legal conclusions. In order to both facilitate reasoning and clarify rulings, he attempted to disambiguate the term \"rights\" by breaking it into eight distinct concepts. To eliminate ambiguity, he defined these terms relative to one another, grouping them into four pairs of Jural Opposites and four pairs of Jural Correlatives.\n\nThis use of the words \"right\" and \"privilege\" correspond respectively to the concepts of claim rights and liberty rights.\n\nHohfeld argued that right and duty are correlative concepts, i.e. the one must always be matched by a claim about the other. If A has a right against B, this is equivalent to B having a duty to honor A's right. If B has no duty, that means that B has a privilege, i.e. B can do whatever he or she pleases because B has no duty to refrain from doing it. Each individual is located within a matrix of relationships with other individuals. By summing the rights held and duties owed across all these relationships, the analyst can identify both the degree of liberty — A would have perfect liberty if A has no duty to refrain from acting and others have a duty never to interfere with A's actions — and whether the concept of liberty is comprised by commonly followed practices, thereby establishing general moral principles and civil rights.\n\nHohfeld defines the correlatives in terms of the relationships between two individuals. In the theory of \"in rem rights\", there is a direct relationship between a person and a thing. Real rights are in this respect unlike claim rights or \"rights in personam\", which by nature must be exercised against a person, the best example being when someone is owed money by another. Hohfeld demonstrates that this way of understanding rights in general is wrong. In particular, Hohfeld demonstrates that there is no such thing as a legal relation between a person and a thing, since a legal relation always operates between two people. As the legal relations between any two people are complex, it is helpful to break them down into their simplest forms. Legal rights do not correspond to single Hohfeldian relations, but are compounds of them. A right can be defined as an aggregate of the Hohfeldian relations with other people.\n\nHohfeld replaces the concept of \"right in personam\" by \"paucital right\" and \"right in rem\" by a compound or aggregate of \"multital rights\". Rights held by a person against one or a few definite persons are paucital (or \"in personam\"), and rights held by a person against a large indefinite class of people are multital (or \"in rem\"). A contract right is paucital (or \"in personam\") because it can be enforced only against the specific parties to the contract. A property right is multital (or \"in rem\") because a landowner has the right to exclude not only specific people from his land but the \"whole world\". The landowner has many rights, privileges, powers, and immunities; his multital rights are composed of many paucital rights. For example, the owner has a right that others do not step on his land but there is not just one such right against a mass of persons (the community), but many separate although usually identical paucital rights with this content (as many instances as there are people in the community). This is what Hohfeld calls \"multital\" rights.\n\nConsider also the definition of liberty. In Hohfeldian analysis, liberty is defined by an absence both of a duty and of a right. B is free because he has no duty to refrain from acting and because A has no right that he not act. That does not deny that B might decide to do what A wants because that is the essence of liberty. Nor does it deny the possibility that B might accept a duty to A to give a benefit to C. In that situation, C would have no right and would have to rely on A to enforce the duty. The truth is that liberty is significant from both a legal and a moral point of view because only liberty ensures that an individual has control over his or her choices on whether and how to act. If something interferes with this choice, the natural reaction is to resent it and to seek a remedy. The correlative between right and duty inevitably describes the way in which two people are limited in their choices to act, and the outside observer cannot capture the legal and moral implications without examining the nature of the right held by A. Hence, this relationship is qualitatively different. An interference with liberty would be considered wrongful without having to ask for detailed evidence. Yet whether A's relationship with B is morally suspect could only be determined by evaluating evidence on precisely what B's duty requires B to do or not to do.\n\n\n\n"}

The nearby mountain, at the western end of the Black Mountain, is named after the village, and has a large area of common land.\n\nThe name 'Betws' is generally thought to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon 'bed-hus' - a house of prayer, or oratory, and means \"chapel\" in the Welsh language. Until the 19th century, when Ammanford developed extensively, Betws was the largest village in the area.\n\nUntil the 13th century, Betws was part of Gower, which is now known as the county of Swansea but the old commote border of the rivers Amman and Loughor moved south and Betws has since the Acts of Union been part of Welsh-speaking Carmarthenshire.\n\nUntil 1817, when a road was built along the Amman valley, Betws was only accessible by roads crossing the mountain from Neath and Swansea. This inaccessibility is commemorated in a local saying, which refers to the division between \"Betws a'r Byd\" (Betws and the world). There was a sign on the Amman bridge to this effect: Betws this way, the rest of the world that way.\n\nThe people of Betws like to make the distinction between themselves and those over the river in Ammanford.\n\nThe road bridge between Betws and Ammanford on Park Street was completed in 1892 and rebuilt in 1990 by T Richard Jones (Betws) Ltd. T. Richard Jones (Betws) Ltd. ('TRJ') is a major building contractor, originally based in the village but now located on the Ammanford side of the river.\n\nThe land for Betws Park was given to Ammanford district Council by Lord Dynevor in 1903, but the council used it as a rubbish dump until the early 1930s. After this, it was properly developed by local volunteers as a park with tennis courts. On 23 June 2007, a new 'Memorial and Sensory Garden' was opened in the park.\n\nBetws Park Workshops are a collection of industrial units rented by various businesses. The workshops were opened in 1991, having previously been a screw manufacturing factory (1970-1981) and a lightbulb factory (1983-1986).\n\nThe parish church in the village is dedicated to St David. It dates to the 14th century but was renovated in 1872.\n\nBetws Primary School was built before 1846, extended in 1928 and refurbished in 1988.\n\nThe Caemawr housing estate was built in 1947, and the Bwtrimawr estate in 1976.\n\nAmmanford No. 1 (1890-1925) and No. 2 (1891-1976) Collieries were at the north end of Betws. The Tycoch nightclub now occupies some Ammanford No. 1 buildings. Betws drift coal mine opened in 1976 and closed in 2003 and the land is being redeveloped as housing and industrial units, including LBS Builders Merchants.\n\nThere are plans to build a wind farm on Betws Common.\n\n75.1% of residents of Betws and Pontamman said they had 'knowledge of Welsh language' compared to 63.6% in Carmarthenshire and 28.4% in Wales.\n\nAs of May 1, 2008, the Betws ward electorate was 1,450 and the County Councillor is Audrey Jones (Independent), replacing John Dorian Evans (Labour).\n\nThe community is bordered by the communities of: Llanedi; Ammanford; Llandybie; and Cwmamman, all being in Carmarthenshire; and by Mawr in the City and County of Swansea.\n\nBetws Rugby Club currently fields two rugby union teams: The first team finished 1st in WRU League Five South West in 2007-8 season and the second team finished bottom of Llanelli District Division 1.\n\nAmmanford football club have a ground at Rice Street, Betws, which is currently being reconstructed.\n\n\nA wide variety of birds can be seen around Betws: Red kites, ravens, buzzards, kestrels and sparrowhawks on the mountain; kingfishers, dippers and cormorants on the river; jays and woodpeckers in the woods.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1971101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971101", "title": "Mafia Commission Trial", "text": "Mafia Commission Trial\n\nThe Mafia Commission Trial (in full, United States v. Anthony Salerno, et al) was a criminal trial in New York City, United States, that lasted from February 25, 1985, until November 19, 1986. Using evidence obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 11 organized crime figures, including the heads of New York's so-called \"Five Families,\" were indicted by United States Attorney Rudolph Giuliani under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) on charges including extortion, labor racketeering, and murder. Eight of them were convicted under RICO, and most of them were sentenced to 100 years in prison on January 13, 1987, the maximum possible sentence under that law.\n\nThe case struck a blow against \"The Commission,\" a ruling committee consisting of the New York Five Families bosses that meet to resolve disputes or discuss criminal activities. \"Time\" magazine called this \"Case of Cases\" possibly \"the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943,\" and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: \"Our approach... is to wipe out the five families.\"\n\nIn 1983, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded several wire tapped conversations of Ralph Scopo extorting money from contractors. Scopo was the president of the Cement and Concrete Workers District Council of the Laborers' International Union of North America from 1977 to April 1985. During this time, Scopo used his position to extort money from cement contractors in New York in return for large construction contracts and labor peace. Contracts between $2 million and $15 million were reserved for a club of contractors called the \"Concrete Club\", which were selected by The Commission. In return, the contractors gave a two percent kickback of the contract value to The Commission. \n\nGennaro Langella supervised various labor rackets for the Colombo crime family, including their stake in \"Concrete Club\", and exerted control over various labor unions, including Cement and Concrete Workers District Council, Local 6A. Anthony Salerno also had hidden controlling interests in S & A Concrete Co. and Transit-Mix Concrete Corp.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Anthony Corallo unwittingly provided the government with evidence that would all but end his career. Over the years, Corallo and Salvatore Avellino established a stranglehold on the waste hauling business on Long Island. To gather evidence against Avellino, members of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force (OCTF) used undercover informant Robert Kubecka, the owner of a Suffolk County, New York garbage hauling business. Since the 1970s, Kubecka had refused to participate with the mob control of the waste hauling business and had suffered extensive harassment as a result. In 1982, Kubecka agreed to wear a surveillance device during meetings with the mobsters. Although Kubecka was unable to get close to Avellino himself, the information Kubecka gathered eventually persuaded a judge to allow a wire tap on Avellino's home phone in Nissequogue, New York. The home phone tap was also disappointing to the agents; however, it did reveal that Avellino was driving Corallo around all day in Avellino's car.\n\nIn 1983, members of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force (OCTF) installed an electronic surveillance device inside the dashboard on Avellino's Jaguar while he and his wife were at a dinner dance. Agents then listened to many conversations between Corallo, Avellino, and other mobsters as they drove around the city. From these recorded conversations, OCTF learned the Commission's internal structure, history, and relations with other crime families. These conversations were shared with federal prosecutors and provided them with invaluable evidence against Corallo and other family bosses in the Mafia Commission Trial.\n\nThe indictments and arrests on February 25, 1985, included nine defendants:\n\nas well as their subordinates,\n\nAdded shortly after:\n\nOn February 25, 1985, nine New York Mafia leaders were indicted for narcotics trafficking, loansharking, gambling, labor racketeering and extortion against construction companies. On July 1, 1985, the original nine men, with the addition of two more New York Mafia leaders, pleaded not guilty to a second set of racketeering charges as part of the trial. Prosecutors aimed to strike at all the crime families at once using their involvement in the Commission. On December 2, 1985, Dellacroce died of cancer. Castellano was later murdered on December 16, 1985. \n\nAccording to Colombo hitman and FBI informant Gregory Scarpa, Persico and Gambino boss John Gotti backed a plan to kill the lead prosecutor, and future New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani in late 1986, but it was rejected by the rest of the Commission.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Bonanno family were kicked off the Commission due to the Donnie Brasco infiltration, and although Rastelli was one of the men initially indicted, this removal from the Commission actually allowed Rastelli to be removed from the Commission Trial as he was later indicted on separate labor racketeering charges. Having previously lost their seat on the Commission, the Bonannos suffered less exposure than the other families in this case. \n\nWhen the lawyers for the accused mafiosi reviewed the evidence, they realized their clients' chances at trial were slim. However, when they sounded out possible plea bargain terms, Giuliani demanded that the defendants plead guilty to the stiffest charges in the indictment, which carried sentences that would have all but assured they would die in prison. The seven defense lawyers, as well as Persico's legal adviser (Persico was acting as his own lawyer) then decided to admit that the Mafia and the Commission existed, but argue that membership in the Mafia or being a boss were not in and of themselves evidence of criminal activity. The mafiosi initially balked, believing that it would amount to a violation of the code of omertà. However, the lawyers impressed upon their clients that they could not credibly deny the existence of the Mafia in the face of their own recorded references to it. Ultimately, the mafiosi agreed to this strategy as long as they did not have to personally admit the Mafia existed.\n\nHence, during his opening statement, Santoro's lawyer, Samuel Dawson, told the jury that there was no question that \"the Mafia exists and has members,\" but asked, \"Can you accept that just because a person is a member of the Mafia that doesn't mean he committed the crimes charged in this case?\" It was the first admission in open court that the Mafia existed.\n\nEight defendants were convicted of racketeering on November 19, 1986, with the exception of Indelicato who was convicted of murder, and were sentenced on January 13, 1987, as follows:\n\nSalerno had initially been billed as the boss of the Genovese family. However, shortly after the trial, Salerno's longtime right-hand man, Vincent \"The Fish\" Cafaro, turned informant, and told the FBI that Salerno had been a front for the real boss, Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante. Cafaro also revealed that the Genovese family had been keeping up this ruse since 1969. However, according to \"New York Times\" organized crime reporter Selwyn Raab, this would not have jeopardized Salerno's conviction at the Commission Trial or his 100-year sentence. In his book, \"Five Families,\" Raab noted that Salerno had been tried and convicted for specific criminal acts, not for being the Genovese boss.\n\n\n"}

It can vary from 5 mm in length when hatched to approximately in mature adults. \n\nThe New Zealand flatworm is considered an invasive species in parts of Europe.\n\nThe ventral surface of the flatworm is a pale buff colour while the dorsal surface is dark brown. Young flatworms vary in colour from white to pale orange and develop their adult colouration as they grow.\n\nDuring the day, flatworms can be found resting on the surface of soil underneath objects in close contact with the ground. They may also be found beneath the soil surface hunting for earthworms.\n\nReproduction involves the production of egg capsules of about 8 mm in length. The capsules are shiny, flexible and cherry red in colour at first and later darken to black after several days. After an unknown incubation period, several pale, tiny flatworms hatch out of the brittle capsule. One egg capsule is produced at a time with the bulge clearly visible in the dorsum of the adult worm.\n\nWhen at rest, \"A. triangulatus\" rolls itself up and can appear like a very tiny Swiss roll. When it starts to move, it uncurls, at the same time as the circular muscles beneath the epidermal cells at the anterior end contract. The paler head-end extends forward, becoming as thin as the lead in a pencil. During movement it is repeatedly raised a couple of millimetres from the substratum before being lowered again.\nAs movement continues, circular, diagonal and longitudinal muscles in the rest of the body contract. Friction between the ventral surface and the substratum is reduced by mucus produced by the ciliated epidermal cells. \"A. triangulatus\" can achieve speeds of up to 17 m per hour.\n\nThe New Zealand flatworm is an invasive species in Europe, feeding there almost exclusively on earthworms. This degrades soil quality. European earthworm predators are reluctant to eat it although cases of frogs and beetle larvae consuming flatworms have been recorded. It has been seen in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Faroe Islands. It might have arrived in the early 1960s, being first recorded in Belfast in 1963. The New Zealand flatworm is easily transported accidentally in plant pots in adult or egg form. They tend to be common in garden centres and may have arrived in the UK with exotic plants.\n\nIt has been suggested that they might thrive in parts of western Norway, southern Sweden, Denmark, Germany and northern parts of Poland, if they invade these regions.\n\nSimilar invasions of other terrestrial planarians are occurring in many other parts of the world. For example, planarians of the genus \"Bipalium\" are widely distributed in North America, and planarians of the genus \"Platydemus\" on many islands in the Pacific. \"Platydemus manokwari\" has recently (2013) been found in Europe.\n\n\n"}

The francophones of France generally use Metropolitan French (spoken in Paris and considered standard) although some also use regional dialects or varieties such as Meridional French. In Europe outside France there are Belgian French, Swiss French, and in Italy Aostan French. In Canada, French is an official language along with English; the two main dialects of French in Canada are Quebec French and Acadian French, but also another dialect commonly grouped as Canadian French, used by Anglophones speaking French as a second language or by Francophones in Canada using a different dialect. In Lebanon, French was an official language until 1941 and the main dialect spoken there is Lebanese French or Levantine French. Note that the discussion here refers to varieties of the French language, not to the Romance sister languages (sometimes considered dialects) of French spoken in France (e.g. Picard, Limousin, Gascon, etc.; for these languages see: Langues d'oïl, Francoprovençal, Occitan and languages of France). See also French-based creole languages, which are also considered separate languages.\n\nFrench is an administrative language and is commonly but unofficially used in the Maghreb states, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. As of 2006, an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 African countries can speak French either as a first or second language, making Africa the continent with the most French speakers in the world. While there are many varieties of African French, common features include the use of an alveolar trill and use of borrowed words from local languages.\n\nAcadian French is a variant of French spoken by francophone Acadians in the Canadian Maritime provinces, the Saint John River Valley in the northern part of the U.S. state of Maine, the Magdalen Islands and Havre-Saint-Pierre, along the St. Lawrence's north shore. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian dialects have some difficulty understanding Acadian French.\n\nNotable features include and becoming and and becoming before front vowels and the use of some archaic words.\n\nChiac is a dialect of combined Acadian French and English and is spoken mainly around Moncton, New Brunswick. The pronunciation of French words is very different from other dialects and resembles English pronunciation. Chiac cannot be identified solely on its frequent use of English words since many other French dialects use many English words as well, but Chiac has an unusual amount of English. Chiac French has developed through proximity to English-speakers who settled nearby during the colonial period. Sounds that are characteristic of Chiac are the different use of the letters \"d\", \"t\", \"r\", and \"c\" (such as the word \"bec\", normally spoken in French with a softer \"c\" sound but spoken as \"beck\" with a hard \"c\" as in the English pronunciation). Other differences include the use of vowel sounds such as \"ea\", \"eo\", \"on\", \"an\", and \"oi\". Such English-stylized pronunciations are different from other dialects of North American French such as Québécois and Brayon. Some forms of Chiac deviate from the original language to the extent that it is nearly incomprehensible to the larger francophone community. Chiac is perhaps best categorized as a creole language alongside Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole, French dialects that incorporate Indigenous, African, and other European languages, as opposed to dialects such as Québécois and Brayon that deviate slightly from Metropolitan French but are nonetheless derived primarily from earlier dialects of French with little contribution from other source languages.\n\nNewfoundland French is a regional dialect of French that was once spoken by settlers in the French colony of Newfoundland.\n\nQuebec French is the dominant and most prevalent regional variety of French found in Canada. Although Quebec French constitutes a coherent and standard system, it has no objective norm since the very organization mandated to establish it, the \"Office québécois de la langue française\", believes that objectively standardizing Quebec French would lead to reduced interintelligibility with other French communities around the world.\n\nOntario French is often divided into two categories: North and South. The further north the more French is spoken and the closer the dialect and culture is to Quebec French. The further south, the French becomes a more pronounced French with a more English cultural influence as well as a Parisian grammar and dialect structure, as both Parisian and Canadian French are taught in the French immersion schools.\n\nNotable features include , , and as allophones of , , and in closed syllables and affrication of and to and before and (the word \"tu\" is pronounced ).\n\nLong vowels are generally diphthongized in closed syllables (the word \"fête\" is pronounced ).\n\nSeveral varieties of French emerged in the United States: Louisiana French, New England French and the nearly-extinct Frenchville French, Missouri French, Muskrat French and Métis French.\n\nLouisiana French, the largest of the groupings, is spoken mostly in Louisiana and derives from the forms of the language spoken by the colonists of lower French Louisiana. Louisiana French is traditionally into three dialects: Colonial French, Modern Louisiana French or \"Acadian\" French, and Louisiana Creole French. Colonial French was originally the dialect spoken by the land-holding educated classes. Acadian, the dialect of the Acadians who came to French Louisiana in droves following their expulsion from Acadia during the French and Indian War, was spoken largely by the white lower classes. Louisiana Creole, a creole that developed long before Haitian immigrants arrived in Louisiana, largely developed as the tongue of the Louisiana Creole community and a significant portion of self-identified Cajuns. However, linguists now believe that the Colonial and Acadian dialects have largely merged into modern Louisiana French but remain distinct from Louisiana Creole.\n\nFrench has gained co-official status with English in Louisiana, and there is both a thriving multi-generational base of speakers as well as a growing network of French immersion schools across the state in order to preserve the language. Louisiana also has a French-language society called CODOFIL (Conseil pour le développement du français en Louisiane).\n\nMissouri French is now spoken by a handful of people in the Midwestern United States, primarily in Missouri. It is the last remnant of the form of French once spoken widely in the region known as the Illinois Country, which was colonized as part of French Louisiana. It is considered very moribund, with only a few elderly speakers still fluent.\n\nNew England French is the local name for Canadian French as it is spoken in New England, except in the Saint John Valley of northern Aroostook County, Maine, where Acadian French predominates.\n\nHaitian French is the variety of French spoken in Haiti. The main difference between Haitian French and the Metropolitan French is in the Haitian speaker's intonation, a rather subtle creole-based tone being used. Importantly, differences are not enough to cause problems between both speakers.\n\nCambodian French is the French of Cambodia. It dates back to the French colonization of Indochina in 1863. Colonists taught French to the local inhabitants, especially the Khmer and Chinese. The locals also taught the colonists Khmer and some Chinese spoken variants, such as Teochew and Cantonese. Cambodian French was influenced by Khmer and Chinese spoken variants, and it was spoken by children of French men married to Khmer or ethnic Chinese women.\n\nCambodian French is still used as a second language in some schools, universities and government offices, but most of the younger generations and members of the business world choose to learn English. Mostly, only older natives still speak French. Since the 1990s, there has been a small revival of French in Cambodia with French-language schools and centres opening. Many Cambodian students travel to France to receive studies as well as French-language media. Nevertheless, Cambodia still has the smallest Francophone population of the three French-speaking Asian countries, the others being Vietnam and Laos.\n\nIndian French is the French spoken by Indians in the former colonies of Pondichéry, Chandannagar, Karaikal, Mahé and Yanam. There is a considerable influence from Dravidian languages like Tamil (Puducherry Tamil dialect), Telugu (Yanam Telugu dialect) and Malayalam (Mahé Malayalam dialect).\n\nLao French is spoken in Laos. It goes back to the French colonization of Indochina despite a decline in the language after the country's independence and the communist takeover. A revival has now raised the number of students learning French to 35%. In addition, the Laotian élite and the elderly population speak French, which is the diplomatic language of Laos.\n\nVietnamese French is spoken in Vietnam, which has the largest Francophone population in Asia. Over 5% of the population learn the language or speak it well. French is also spoken among the elderly in Vietnam as a legacy of the colonial French era and also by the country's élite. A French pidgin, Tây Bồi, was spoken by Vietnamese servants in French households during the colonial era. Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the number of French-speakers in Vietnam and the number of students taking the language have declined, but French remains taught as an optional foreign language in higher education.\n\nAostan French (French: \"français valdôtain\") is the variety of French spoken in the Aosta Valley of Italy, where there is a significant trilingual francophone population. Some expressions, words and phrases are different from Standard French, some of them are similar to Swiss French and some reflecting the influence of Piedmontese language or Italian. Both French and Italian overlay the indigenous local language continuum of Aosta Valley, called \"Valdôtain\" (locally, \"patois\"), which is Franco-Provençal in type.\n\nBelgian French (French: \"français de Belgique\") is the variety of French spoken mainly in the French Community of Belgium, alongside related minority regional languages such as Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Gaumais. Belgian French and the French of northern France are almost identical.\n\nNotable features include a strong distinction between long and short vowels, the lack of the approximant , and the use of certain Belgicisms.\n\nJersey Legal French is the official dialect of French used administratively in Jersey. Notable features include some archaic word choices and the words \"septante\" and \"nonante\" for \"seventy\" and \"ninety\" respectively.\n\nMeridional French (French: \"français méridional\") is the regional variant of the French spoken in Occitania. It is strongly influenced by Occitan.\n\nSwiss French () is the variety of French spoken in the French-speaking area of Switzerland known as Romandy. The differences between Swiss French and Parisian French are minor and mostly lexical.\n\n"}
