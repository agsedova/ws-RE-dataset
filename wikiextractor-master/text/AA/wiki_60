{"id": "1863264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863264", "title": "Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius", "text": "Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\n\nWritten in Syriac in the late seventh century, the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius shaped and influenced Christian eschatological thinking in the Middle Ages. Falsely attributed to Methodius of Olympus, a fourth century Church Father, the work attempts to make sense of the Islamic conquest of the Near East. The \"Apocalypse\" is noted for incorporating numerous aspects of Christian eschatology such as the invasion of Gog and Magog, the rise of the Antichrist, and the tribulations that precede the end of the world.\n\nThe \"Apocalypse\", however, adds a new element to Christian eschatology: the rise of a messianic Roman emperor. This element would remain in Christian apocalyptic literature until the end of the medieval period. Translations into Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Arabic, and other languages from the early eighth century onwards would facilitate the \"Apocalypse\"’s influence.\n\nThe \"Apocalypse\" is attributed to Methodius of Olympus in the Syriac text, of Patara in the Greek, both of whom lived in the fourth century. In all likelihood, however, the text was written in the seventh century by an unnamed Christian cleric, hence the moniker of Pseudo-Methodius, who was most likely of the Jacobite, Chalcedonian, or Melkite branch of Christianity. Scholars have argued that the work was written as a contemporary to the Arab Conquests in response to the hardships faced by Christians and widespread apostasy to avoid taxations. As well, the author sees the invasion occurring as punishment from God. The text, therefore, employs historiography, geography, and apocalyptic prophecy.\n\nThe text was originally written in Syriac in Northern Syria. Early scholarship, however, lacked the original Syrian text, and so relied heavily on Greek, Latin, and Slavonic texts for study. In 1897, the scholar V. Istrin relied heavily on the Greek text and at the same time, and independently, Sackur studied the oldest Latin translations. Both of these studies ushered in the scholarly study of the \"Apocalypse\", but it was not until 1931 that the original Syriac manuscript was discovered. With this find, Michael Kmosko was able to ascertain that original \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\" to have been written in the Syriac language.\n\nThe manuscript begins with a history of the world, starting with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, through to the Muslim conquests, and into the end-times. One notable feature about the work is the presence of sexuality with regards to Christian behavior in the end days—specifically discussing swinging, homosexuality, and cross-dressing as indicators of a sinful society. It is only then that the text says the “sons of Ishmael”, that is Muslims, will emerge from the desert of Ethribus to inflict God’s punishment upon the Christians who “slipped into depravity”. The \"Apocalypse\" also recounts the events that took place at the hands of Muslims in the previous decades. In invoking figures in other Christian eschatological literature, such as Gog and Magog, Pseudo-Methodius attempts to legitimize his place as a fourth century Church Father. The manuscript also notes the rise of an Emperor-Saviour figure, echoing the fourth century AD prophecy contributed to the legendary Tiburtine Sibyl. This Roman emperor will save the Christian lands from “the sons of Ishmael”, place his crown upon the cross “for the sake of the common salvation of all” thereby saving Christendom as a whole. The work is notable for its vivid description and brutality. Descriptions of drinking the blood of cattle, stabbing pregnant women, and feeding babies to animals permeate throughout the author’s work.\n\nBallard notes, however, that Pseudo-Methodius deviates from previous eschatological literature, such as \"Revelation\", in that the \"Apocalypse\" utilizes Roman emperors as agents of change. For this reason, Griffith notes, the \"Apocalypse\" marks the end of the antique era and the dawn of the Middle Ages. Guenther also notes that Pseudo-Methodius was influenced by the books \"Revelation\" and \"Daniel\", maintaining the lineage of Christian literature. This is an important feature as it shows the author was most likely a Christian cleric and was familiar with past Christian writings. By introducing new features into Christian literature while keeping core Christian beliefs and teachings intact helped to make the \"Apocalypse\" accessible to the laity, as well. Part of the \"Apocalypse\"’s influence is attributed to its ability to reflect the beliefs of Eastern Roman citizens; they are merely acting out foretold events, and mankind is bound with the fate of the empire and the capital. This, again, helped to endear the piece to a widespread Byzantine audience.\n\nRome and Sassanid Persia had been at war with one another for much of the first quarter of the seventh century. With both empires still feeling the effects of such a long series of battles, an Arab threat took advantage of the weakening empires. The Persians faced defeat west of the Euphrates in Qadisiyya in what Griffith calls “the beginning of the demise of both Roman and Persian rule for good”. This demise would continue throughout the 630s and 640s, as the Arabs conquered much of the Middle East and the Mediterranean world. In 635, Damascus fell, Jerusalem and Antioch followed in 637, Edessa in 640, Alexandria in 642, and Seleucia/Ctesiphon in 645. Three out of the five patriarchates of Roman Christendom were under Arab Muslim rule. In 674, the Ummayad Caliph Muawiyah launched a land and sea assault on Constantinople. Within three years he was defeated and turned his attention on the rest of the surviving Roman Empire, namely the Middle East, Greece, and the Balkans. As Ballard notes, Constantinople was “reduced to a small Christian enclave within an ocean of Islam.”\n\nA campaign by the new Muslim rulers was set in place in order to remove any public display of Christian symbolism through building Islamic-styled buildings and issuing coins declaring an Islamic triumph. The most dramatic of such constructions was the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. The inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock are taken from the Quran and “proclaim the arrival of a powerful empire that was founded on pure monotheist belief.” This, as Ballard and Griffith both note, was in response to Christians believing in the trinity, and their supposed worship of the Virgin Mary and the Saints something that Muslims saw as polytheistic.\n\nTo defend themselves and without any real power or authority, Christians turned to writing. The hardships Christians faced in a Muslim territory caused a “literary awakening”, and the earliest of these texts were written in Syriac, Greek, and Arabic. Syriac writers in particular reacted to their world in apocalyptic terms – the fall of their Christian empire was continuing with each Muslim conquest and Syriac writers saw these conquests as a punishment from God. The most well-known of these texts was the \"Apocalypse\" attributed to Pseudo-Methodius.\n\nThe \"Apocalypse\" marks the end of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages because of its style and influence. The document was frequently copied and readapted in order to fit the cataclysmic events that occurred in a particular area. By the early 8th century, the work was translated into Greek and then Latin and other languages. The Apocalypse was most likely translated into Latin by Petrus Monachus in Francia. The spread and influence of the \"Apocalypse\" was so far reaching that during the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, Russian Christians invoked the work of Pseudo-Methodius in order to explain the onslaught by using the historical and geographical explanations found within the text. As well, Christians believed Pseudo-Methodius had predicted the Mongols’ arrival because of their lifestyle, dietary habits, and activities. However, Pelle notes the \"Apocalypse\" was not popular in England before the Norman Conquests, despite the popularity of other eschatological literature. Of the almost twenty-four pre-twelfth century Latin manuscripts, only two were in English and none were from before 1075. With the invasion of England by the Normans, however, one of the earliest English texts to explain the invasion of “heathens” on a Christian land included the \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\". The \"Apocalypse\" was invoked by Christians throughout the centuries in order to explain the turmoil they faced in their respective time and place. As well, it shaped Western Christendom’s view of Islam through the Middle Ages because of various re-adaptions and translations. With the fall of more Christian cities from the fourteenth century onwards, along with Constantinople in 1453, the \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\" was invoked once again.\n\nGriffith notes, because of questions surrounding the historicity of the \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\", it is easy to dismiss the piece outright. However, for the historian the \"Apocalypse\" sheds a light on the environment of the age and therefore the literature is still relevant. Furthermore, the literature is important because of the anonymity of its author. In a sense, this anonymity lends a sense of “underground literature”. Furthermore, the \"Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius\" allowed the population, regardless of locale, to maintain a “sense of seemingly rightful superiority” despite evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n"}

Attending Merton College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar he received his D. Phil in 1949.\n\nAfter completing his residency, Feindel was in neurosurgical practice for two years with Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute. In 1955 he founded the Neurosurgical Department at the University Hospital in Saskatoon.\n\nIn 1959 Feindel re-joined the Montreal Neurological Institute where he founded the William Cone Laboratory for Neurosurgical Research and became the first William Cone Professor of Neurosurgery and then Director of the MNI from 1972 to 1984. During this tenure he led a clinical neuroscience team to acquire the first CAT and combined MRI/S units in Canada and to develop the world's first PET system utilizing a prototype Japanese \"Baby\" cyclotron and the MNI-designed BGO crystal PET scanner for detecting brain tumours and stroke. He integrated these systems into a Brain Imaging Center (BIC), within a major extension of the MNI, opened in 1984 and since then recognized as a leading world center for clinical diagnosis, teaching and research in neuro-imaging.\n\nIn the early 1950s, during brain mapping studies with Penfield and Jasper, Feindel discovered the role of the amygdala in patients with temporal lobe seizures, which, with related studies at the MNI, led to the operation of antero-mesial temporal lobe resection often referred to as \"the Montreal procedure\", an operation adopted worldwide for the surgical cure of many thousands of patients with epilepsy.\n\nFeindel was curator of the Wilder Penfield Archive. He was the Chancellor of Acadia University from 1991 to 1996 and then Honorary Governor. In 1998 he was elected Honorary Osler Librarian by the Board of Curators of the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at McGill University. At the 2005 Neuro Convocation, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award of the Montreal Neurological Institute. He was Senior Consultant in Neurosurgery and Professor of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill University and Director of the Neuro-History Project at the Montreal Neurological Institute.\n\nHe died at the Montreal Neurological Institute after a brief illness.\n\n"}

Those with the disorder usually have suffered from a right hemisphere frontal or temporal brain lesion typically affecting the cortical areas, basal ganglia or limbic structures. These people develop a new, post-injury passion for gourmet food.\n\nThere are two main aspects of gourmand syndrome: first, the fine dining habits and changes to taste, and second, the obsessive component, which may result in craving and preservation. Gourmand syndrome can be related to, and shares biological features with, addictive and obsessive disorders. The syndrome was first characterised in 1997.\n\n\nIt is believed that the frontotemporal circuits, normally involved in healthy eating, can, when injured, cause gourmand syndrome in patients.\n\nOnly 36 people had been diagnosed with gourmand syndrome as of 2001. In many of these cases, the patient did not have any interest in food beforehand nor had any family history with eating disorders.\n\nThe first, most famous case was seen in 1997 by Regard and Landis in the journal \"Neurology\": after a Swiss stroke patient was released from the hospital, he immediately quit his job as a political journalist and took up the profession of food critic. Regard and Landis also observed an athletic businessman with this condition whose family was shocked to see such a sudden, drastic change in his diet. \n\nOnly one case of gourmand syndrome has been reported in a child. He was born with issues with his right temporal lobe; at eight years old he began to experience seizures, within the year of the seizures beginning, his behavior began to change to the symptoms of gourmand syndrome.\n\nIn 2014, a man that was once interested in marathon running now was only interested in gastronomy, traveling hundreds or thousands of miles to eat gourmet food. He became a famous gastronomic critic and gained 50 kg (110 pounds).\n\n"}

She began training with The Fabulous Moolah right after finishing high school. In the 1980s, as part of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection, a storyline that combined wrestling and music, Kai defeated Wendi Richter to become the Women's Champion. Kai, however, lost the title at the inaugural WrestleMania event. She was later paired with Judy Martin, in a tag team that would become known as The Glamour Girls. The team held the Women's Tag Team Championship twice (managed by \"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart) and the LPWA Tag Team Championship once. In her later career, Kai returned briefly to the WWF in 1994, challenging for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania X. She also wrestled for World Championship Wrestling under the name Patty Stonegrinder and held the NWA World Women's Championship.\n\nSeymour was trained by The Fabulous Moolah in 1975 right after she finished high school. She was originally from Florida, but because Moolah thought she looked a little bit Hawaiian, Seymour was given the ring name Leilani Kai. Her fellow wrestlers also bestowed upon her the nickname \"The Hawaiian Princess\" during her early career. Four weeks after beginning her training, Moolah sent her on a two-week tour of Alaska. Over the next few years she worked for promotions throughout the United States, including in Oklahoma, Minnesota, California, and New York. It was in 1979 in North Carolina, that Kai first began working with Judy Martin, who would be her future tag team partner.\n\nOn July 23, 1984, Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah at MTV's \"The Brawl to End it All\" for the WWF Women's Championship, ending what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign, though in reality she had won and lost the title on numerous occasions and Richter actually ended a 7-year reign). As a result, in early 1985, Kai—who had been trained by Moolah—wrestled Richter and defeated her for the title at \"The War to Settle the Score\", with Moolah in her corner and singer Cyndi Lauper in Richter's corner. Richter, however, regained the title at the first-ever WrestleMania one month later. These matches were part of the WWF's \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling.\n\nKai was then paired with Judy Martin, and the duo won the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship from the champions Velvet McIntyre and Desiree Petersen in Egypt in August 1985, although this match's existence has been disputed. Meanwhile, in August 1986, Kai traveled to Japan where she won All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling's All Pacific Championship from Chigusa Nagayo, whom she also lost the title to in April 1987.\n\nIn November 1987, Kai and Martin became known as The Glamour Girls, and she underwent an image change that involved bleaching her dark hair platinum blonde at the suggestion of their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face the Fabulous Moolah's team. Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women's Tag Team Championship. The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988, with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold. Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women's division.\n\nThe Glamour Girls then surfaced in the newly formed Ladies Professional Wrestling Association (LPWA), managed by Adnan El Kassey. In February 1991, they won the LPWA Tag Team Championship from the team of Misty Blue and Heidi Lee Morgan. Leilani Kai appeared on the November 10, 1991 episode of \"WCW Main Event\", losing to Madusa. They retained the Tag Team Championship against Malia Hosaka and Bambi at the only LPWA pay per view Superladies Showdown in 1992. The title was abandoned when the promotion closed.\n\nKai returned to the WWF on March 20, 1994 at WrestleMania X to unsuccessfully challenge Alundra Blayze in a Women's Championship match. In the mid-to-late 1990s, Kai wrestled in World Championship Wrestling under the name Patty Stonegrinder, usually wrestling against Madusa.\n\nKai traded the NWA Mid-Atlantic Women's Championship with Strawberry Fields in 2000, holding the belt a total of three times. In the summer of 2002, Kai challenged Lexie Fyfe for the Professional Girl Wrestling Association's (PGWA) championship in Branson, Missouri and won the belt. In 2002, however, Pippa L'Vinn defeated her for the title.\n\nOn March 12, 2003, she defeated Madison to win the NWA World Women's Championship in a dark match on a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view. She defended the belt at the NWA 55th Anniversary Show against AJ Sparx in October 2003. She was later stripped of the title by NWA President Bill Behrens on June 19, 2004 after Kai no-showed several events.\n\nAfter becoming less active in the ring, she also began training female wrestlers, including Amber O'Neal. She also served as a trainer for the California-based Women of Wrestling.\n\nOn September 5, 2013 it was announced that Kai will debut at Pro Wrestling Syndicate Bombshells against Sumie Sakai on September 28 in Iselin, NJ.\n\nOn May 31, 2014 Kai appeared on West Coast Wrestling Connection, slapping Kylie Sutton for allegedly implying that she was old. The following week, Kai was scheduled to face Sutton in a match. After refusing to participate, she forced her manager Jonny Fairplay to take her place. Sutton won the match by DQ after Kai entered the ring and attacked her, before referees pulled her off.\n\nIn addition to wrestling, Seymour has trained with nunchucks for at least two years. She also rides motorcycles, deep sea fishes, and hunts wild boar. Seymour previously owned an apartment in Hawaii.\n\n\n\n"}

She was the first woman and the youngest person to hold the position. Swinson served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Dunbartonshire from 2005 to 2015 and 2017 to 2019.\n\nSwinson studied at the London School of Economics, and briefly worked in public relations, before being elected to the House of Commons, becoming the youngest MP at the time. She served as a Liberal Democrat Spokesperson covering various portfolios, including Scotland, Women and Equalities, Communities and Local Government, and Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.\n\nIn 2010, after the Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition government with the Conservative Party, Swinson served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, and was later appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs. She lost her seat in the 2015 election, but regained it in the snap election held two years later. Shortly after returning to Parliament, she was elected unopposed as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats. In July 2019, after the retirement of Vince Cable, Swinson defeated Ed Davey in a leadership election to become Leader of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nSwinson led her party through the 2019 general election shortly afterwards, suggesting she could lead a Liberal Democrat majority government which would revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit. Instead, Swinson lost her seat to the Scottish National Party and was disqualified from continuing as party leader. Leader of the party for four and a half months, Swinson’s tenure as Leader was the shortest in the Liberal Democrats' history.\n\nSwinson was born in Glasgow on 5 February 1980, the daughter of Peter and Annette Swinson. She was educated at Douglas Academy, a mixed state school in the town of Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire in western Scotland, followed by the London School of Economics, where she studied Management, gaining a first-class Bachelor of Science degree in 2000. She signed up as an active member of the Liberal Democrats at the age of 17.\n\nAfter graduating from the London School of Economics, Swinson moved to Yorkshire and worked for Ace Visual and Sound Systems in Thorne, before becoming a marketing and public relations manager for Hull-based commercial radio station Viking FM from December 2000, and media company Space and People.\n\nAt the age of 21, Swinson stood unsuccessfully in the Kingston upon Hull East constituency in the 2001 general election, but gained a 6% swing from John Prescott, then the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In 2003, she unsuccessfully contested Strathkelvin and Bearsden seat in the Scottish Parliament election, finishing third with 14% of the vote.\n\nSwinson was elected to the House of Commons as the MP for East Dunbartonshire at the 2005 general election. She defeated John Lyons of Labour by 4,061 votes, and was the first ever Member of Parliament born in the 1980s. As the youngest MP she replaced fellow Lib Dem MP Sarah Teather as the \"Baby of the House\". This lasted until 2009, when Conservative MP Chloe Smith was elected at the Norwich North by-election.\n\nSwinson was vocal in her opposition to the Iraq War and the Labour government's proposals for national identity cards. She has supported measures both by individuals and government to tackle climate change such as conserving energy in the home and the Liberal Democrat policy of introducing green taxes while reducing income tax to offset the burden. She supports reducing the voting age to 16 as one way of engaging young people in politics. She believes more women should be involved in politics but that encouragement is better than affirmative action in achieving this. She opposes positive discrimination to address gender imbalance, and led the argument against positive discrimination to select her party's candidates at their national party conference in 2002, wearing a pink T-shirt inscribed with the slogan, \"I am not a token woman\".\n\nSwinson has also called for a \"wellbeing index\" to be introduced, to be compared against GDP, and tabled an early day motion on the issue in 2008, gaining 50 signatures. She found support from MPs such as Vince Cable and Angela Eagle. Swinson cited the fact that although standard of living had increased, people's level of wellbeing had been virtually static for some time, according to polls.\n\nSwinson believed that new prisons ought not to be built and had campaigned vocally, but without success, against the rebuilding of a prison at Bishopbriggs within the constituency. She had said that if a prison was built it must not be built cheaply, and that it must not be named after the town in which is to be sited. The campaign to give the prison its original name was ultimately successful, as the replacement prison will retain its original name, Lowmoss Prison.\n\nShe is an active campaigner against excessive packaging of chocolate Easter eggs. Each year from 2007 saw Swinson attack confectionery manufacturers for wasteful use of non-recyclable materials in packaging of the seasonal goods. She has named Guylian as the worst offender, followed by Lindt, Baileys and Cadbury.\n\nSwinson successfully held her seat of East Dunbartonshire in the 2010 general election, although with a slightly decreased majority. Her party, the Liberal Democrats, subsequently entered into a coalition with the Conservative Party.\n\nIn November 2010, Swinson was made Parliamentary Private Secretary to then Business Secretary Vince Cable.\n\nIn December 2010, she was one of 27 Liberal Democrat MPs who voted in favour of allowing universities to raise tuition fees up to £9,000 per year.\n\nIn February 2012, Swinson replaced Norman Lamb as Parliamentary Private Secretary to then Liberal Democrat Leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, holding this position until her promotion to government minister later that year.\n\nIn September 2012, Swinson was appointed Under Secretary of State for Employment Relations and Consumer Affairs in a reshuffle by then Prime Minister David Cameron. She maintained this role for the remainder of the Cameron-Clegg coalition, except for several months of maternity leave between 2013 and 2014.\n\nSwinson initially focused efforts on scrapping the 1871 Pedlars Act, which prevents pedlars (travelling salesmen) and street traders from trading without first acquiring a certificate from the police. In November 2012, Swinson said that the proposed deregulation would help “eliminate barriers to street traders and pedlars by making it easier to trade, boosting retail and helping small traders – including many young entrepreneurs – to expand and grow”. The proposal was criticised by the Local Government Association, which claimed that it would lead to a 'free for all' of pedlars targeting vulnerable people. By 2014, however, Swinson announced she would seek to amend rather than repeal the laws.\n\nSwinson opposed forcing companies to adopt gender quotas, stating that such a move would \"negatively affect\" the performance of businesses. She instead promoted voluntary solutions, telling an event organised by the British Chambers of Commerce, \"What women need is confidence, not quotas. So rather than telling companies what to do, we’re encouraging them to see the real business benefits of taking voluntary action.\"\n\nFrom 2013, Swinson sought to promote fathers' rights in regard to parental leave, bringing forth new legislation which allowed parents to divide parental leave between themselves with an aim to encourage fathers to spend more time with their newborn infants.\n\nIn October 2013, controversy emerged after MPs in the House of Commons allowed Swinson, then pregnant, to stand for 20 minutes without offering her a seat. This led to political debate and comment about whether or not it was sexist to give up a seat for a pregnant woman, with Prime Minister David Cameron wading into the row to say that offering pregnant women seats was the right thing to do. Swinson herself later commented that it was not sexist to offer a pregnant woman a seat, and that it was \"great for people to offer, and part of life's little courtesies.\"\n\nIn the area of employment, she was supportive of both zero hours contracts and flexible working, seeking to promote the latter especially. On minimum wage, in February 2013 Swinson joined calls by other ministers to warn that \"caution\" was required when increasing it any further amid claims that minimum wage could be cut or frozen if it began costing jobs. Swinson pledged £80,000 of government financial support for the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, an initiative led by corporations including Aviva Investors and Calvert which measures and ranks performance of global companies in regard to human rights.\n\nSwinson was keen to promote employee ownership, such as employee ownership of shares, through the establishment of a FTSE-compliant UK Employee Ownership Index, supporting measures to reduce regulations for companies choosing to adopt employee ownership practices, and a scheme allowing companies to contractually offer employees £2,000 to £50,000 worth of shares (which would be exempted from capital gains tax) in exchange for waiving certain employee rights. Swinson traced employee ownership back to the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, and claimed such ownership models improve productivity and lower absenteeism in staff.\n\nBy 2014, it was being reported that Swinson was tipped to replace Alistair Carmichael as Scottish Secretary and enter the Cabinet in a potential reshuffle, which at the time would have made her the youngest female Cabinet member ever and the first Cabinet member to be born in the 1980s. At the same time, however, electoral projections for the 2015 general election showed Swinson was under serious risk of losing her East Dunbartonshire seat to a surge of Scottish National Party support.\n\nShortly before the 2015 general election, \"The Times\" and \"Financial Times\" reported that Swinson was one of a number of prominent 'right-leaning' Liberal Democrat MPs, aligned to then Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, deliberately excluded from campaign funding by former leading Liberal Democrat peer and donor Matthew Lord Oakeshott even though their seats, including Swinson's, were vulnerable marginals.\n\nSwinson was featured in the 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 editions of the ‘London's 1000 most influential people’ list by the \"Evening Standard\".\n\nSwinson lost her parliamentary seat in the 2015 general election to Scottish National Party candidate John Nicolson by 2,167 votes (4.0%). She stood again for her former seat during the 2017 general election and won with a lead of 5,339 votes (10.3%) over Nicolson. During this time, she wrote her book \"Equal Power: And How You Can Make It Happen\".\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, Swinson received political funding from Mark Petterson, the director of Warwick Energy Ltd, which has fracking licences across England. She has also voted against plans to ban fracking in the UK.\n\nAfter the resignation of Tim Farron as Liberal Democrat leader on 14 June 2017, Swinson was named by the BBC as one of the possible contenders for the leadership along with Norman Lamb and Vince Cable. She later announced that she would not seek the leadership; instead, she became Deputy Leader after being the only candidate at the close of nominations.\n\nAs of October 2017, she was her party's Spokesperson for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.\n\nAt the Liberal Democrat autumn conference of 2017, Swinson drew media attention for using the phrase \"Faragey, Trumpy, angry, arsey, shouty slogans\" in criticising populism. In the same speech she called for the state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to be cancelled, warned about Brexit, and condemned Venezuela's Maduro government as well as Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn for his stance on the Venezuelan protests.\n\nIn February 2018, Swinson's first book \"Equal Power: And How You Can Make It Happen\" was published by Atlantic Books. Discussing her book, Swinson explained that government has \"limitations\" when addressing gender inequality, so her book instead mainly suggests ideas for people to make changes in their own homes and workplaces. \"The Irish Times\" likened \"Equal Power\" to the \"corporate feminism\" of Sheryl Sandberg's \"Lean In\", while \"The Herald\" also noted \"A read of \"Equal Power\" makes it apparent that Swinson is a fan of Sheryl Sandberg's \"Lean In\".\" Swinson's book was featured at the Aye Write! literary festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn a March 2018 article for \"The Mail on Sunday,\" Swinson came out in favour of erecting a statue of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Parliament Square. She justified her position on feminist grounds and claimed that Thatcher was able to \"single-handedly transform the fortunes of women\", accusing opponents of the Thatcher statue as being \"pretty sexist\". Swinson praised Thatcher for her skills in negotiating the UK rebate and for taking the UK into the single market, but was also critical of Thatcher for the poll tax and stressed she did not consider herself a Thatcherite. In addition, she wrote that there should be a statue of the first female First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon in time, though she disagrees with Scottish independence.\n\nIn July 2018, Swinson was absent for key votes on the Brexit negotiations, having been on maternity leave following the birth of her second son. Despite this, she still attended an anti-Trump protest. Fellow MP, Labour's Kate Hoey, criticised this behaviour in a tweet. Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis had formally agreed not to vote, so that Swinson's absence would not affect the result. Lewis voted with the government nonetheless, leading Swinson to accuse the government of resorting to \"desperate stuff\" and a \"calculated, deliberate breaking of trust\". Lewis apologised, alongside Cabinet Office minister David Lidington and government chief whip Julian Smith. Apologising on Twitter, Lewis said that it was an \"honest mistake made by the whips in fast-moving circumstances.\"\n\nIn May 2019, Vince Cable announced he would relinquish his role as leader of the Liberal Democrats in July, triggering a leadership election. Subsequently, while appearing on the 30 May edition of the BBC political discussion programme \"Question Time\", Swinson confirmed that she would put her name forward in the forthcoming contest.\n\nOn 22 July 2019, Swinson was elected the first-ever female leader of the Liberal Democrats, with 47,997 (62.8%) votes, gaining a clear victory over Sir Ed Davey, with 28,021 votes. She was the first leader of a major British political party born in the 1980s. Under her leadership, the party's candidate and Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds won the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, following a \"remain alliance\" in which Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party agreed not to stand candidates. The party's membership also rose to a record 115,000+ members, with many party supporters attributing this rise to what they called \"the Swinson surge\".\n\nIn her first Leader's Speech to the Liberal Democrat Federal Conference, on 17 September 2019, Swinson said that Boris Johnson \"claims he can negotiate a Brexit deal in a month. I wouldn't hold out much hope: yesterday he couldn't negotiate where to have a press conference\".\n\nSwinson campaigned on a platform of revoking Article 50 if the Liberal Democrats formed the government. Swinson launched her campaign by declaring that she was \"a candidate to be prime minister\", and suggesting her party could win a majority. However poll ratings for the party were poor and Swinson's personal ratings declined throughout the campaign.\n\nDuring the campaign, Swinson clashed with Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland on the subject of nuclear weapons. Asked if she would be prepared to use nuclear weapons, Swinson replied simply \"yes\". Sturgeon commented that \"It's sickening to hear this question asked and answered as if it's some kind of virility test and without any context... Using nuclear weapons would mean killing millions of people.\"\n\nSwinson ceased to be leader on 13 December 2019, when in the general election she lost her own seat in parliament to the SNP. The party's rules disqualified her from continuing as its leader. She had led the party for 144 days. As well as losing seats, the Liberal Democrats failed to make predicted gains. An internal party review said that their election campaign was worsened by \"an inexperienced inner circle\" around Swinson. It said that voters who were neither fervently leave or remain were \"effectively ignored\" by her promise to revoke Article 50.\n\nOn 13 May 2011, Swinson married then fellow Liberal Democrat MP Duncan Hames, in a humanist ceremony. The couple's first child was born in December 2013. A second son was born in June 2018.\n\nSwinson completed the Loch Ness Marathon in 2007, the 2011 London Marathon and the inaugural Stirling Scottish Marathon in 2017. Through this, she has raised money for the Anaphylaxis Campaign and Bloodwise. She ran the London Landmarks Half Marathon in March 2019 in memory of her father, who had died of blood cancer the previous year.\n\nHaving a peanut allergy, Swinson sustained anaphylactic shock in May 2013 after eating a biscuit containing nuts in Glasgow. She collapsed with breathing difficulty, recovering on administration of adrenaline, and an overnight stay in hospital.\n\nSwinson was made a CBE in the 2018 New Year Honours for political and public service. On receiving the honour, Swinson said she was privileged \"to be listed among so many remarkable people from all walks of life, making amazing contributions right across our country\".\n\nSwinson is a humanist. She is a member of the humanist charity Humanists UK.\n\n"}

{"id": "1863306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863306", "title": "John Moffat (physicist)", "text": "John Moffat (physicist)\n\nJohn W. Moffat (born 24 May 1932) is a Danish-born British-Canadian physicist. He is currently Professor Emeritus in physics at the University of Toronto and is also an adjunct Professor in physics at the University of Waterloo and a resident affiliate member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics.\n\nMoffat is best known for his work on gravity and cosmology, culminating in his nonsymmetric gravitational theory and scalar–tensor–vector gravity (now called MOG), and summarized in his 2008 book for general readers, \"Reinventing Gravity\". His theory explains galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter. He proposes a variable speed of light approach to cosmological problems. The speed of light \"c\" may have been more than 30 orders of magnitude higher during the early moments of the Big Bang. His recent work on inhomogeneous cosmological models purports to explain certain anomalous effects in the CMB data, and to account for the recently discovered acceleration of the expansion of the universe.\n\nMoffat has proposed a new nonlocal variant of quantum field theory, that is finite at all orders and hence dispenses with renormalization. It also generates mass without a Higgs mechanism.\n\nMoffat was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, the son of a Scottish father, George Moffat, and Danish mother, Esther (\"née\" Winther). His father, a musician from Glasgow, was performing in a night club in Copenhagen when he met Esther, a dancer. They married three weeks later.\n\nIn 1938, on the eve of the Second World War, John's father moved the family to London, correctly predicting that Denmark would be invaded by Germany. In later 1939, during the Blitz, the 7-year-old John was evacuated to Glasgow to live with his grandparents. But he failed to thrive in Glasgow, struggling academically, so after a year he returned to his parents, and all three moved to Bristol, where his father got a job searching ships for German spies.\n\nIn Bristol, they lived close to the factory that manufactured the Bristol F2 Fighters. Air raids were frequent as the Battle of Britain intensified in 1940. One day, they went to the boardwalk at Weston-super-Mare to escape the raids in Bristol, only to have German planes appear overhead. As Moffat recalled in his memoir, \"Einstein Wrote Back\":\n\"I heard the shriek of the whistling bombs as they fell, and then the hollow booms as they detonated deep inside the mud of the beach... The blast blew my parents and me across the road adjacent to the boardwalk. I landed in a garden on my back, opened my eyes and stared at the blue sky, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. The blood was pouring out of my nose, and I felt a terrible tightness and pain in my chest... In a daze, I got up, and soon discovered my parents in the same garden, on all fours, attempting to stand up, also suffering from nosebleeds and chest pains.\"\n\nThe trauma from the bombing and the air-raids stayed with him for a lifetime, Moffat wrote: \n\n\"At the time, I was somehow able to suppress the horror of our experiences during the war, and carry on day by day. However, about a year after the bombings in Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, I began suffering from what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. I began getting severe nightmares and panic attacks. Even today I still occasionally experience panic attacks, generally when I am visiting Europe.\"\n\nWhen John was 7 or 8, his father took him to a psychiatrist in London because he insisted on reading sentences and clocks backward. The psychiatrist told his father that he was a genius. John, overhearing, did not think the word meant much for his future.\n\nAfter the war, the family moved back to Denmark, where John's father started an import-export business. He contracted tuberculosis from one of his employees and became seriously ill for a year, and the family struggled to get by.\n\nAs a teenager, Moffat quit school at 16 to become an artist. He gave up after living for a time in Paris with no income. Upon returning to Copenhagen, he became interested in the cosmos and began teaching himself mathematics and physics. The University of Copenhagen allowed anyone to check out books from its libraries, and he made such quick progress that within a year he began working on problems of general relativity and unified field theory.\n\nWhen Moffat was about 20 years old, he wrote a letter to Albert Einstein, informing the great physicist that he was working on one of his theories. \"Dear Professor . . . I would be eternally indebted if you could find time to read my work,\" he began.\n\"In 1953 Einstein sent me a reply, from Princeton, New Jersey, but it was written in German. So I ran down to my barber shop (in Copenhagen) to have my barber translate it for me. Through that summer and fall, we exchanged about a half dozen letters. The local press picked up on these stories which then caught the attention of physicist Niels Bohr and others. Suddenly doors of opportunity were swinging open for me\". (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, 2005)\n\nEinstein's initial reply:\n\n\"Most honorable Mr. Moffat: Our situation is the following. We are standing in front of a closed box which we cannot open, and we try hard to discuss what is inside and what is not,\" Einstein replied.\nMoffat's correspondence with Einstein and meeting with Bohr drew the attention of officials at the British consulate in Copenhagen, and he was invited to study at Cambridge. In 1958, he was awarded a PhD without a first degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was supervised by Fred Hoyle and Abdus Salam.\n\nIn 1992, John Moffat proposed that the speed of light was much larger in the early universe, in which the speed of light had a value of more than 10 km/s. He published his \"variable speed of light\" (VSL) theory in two places—on the Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) online archive, 16 Nov. 1992, and in a 1993 edition of \"International Journal of Modern Physics D\".\n\nThe scientific community mostly ignored VSL theory until in 2001, University of New South Wales astronomer John Webb and peers detected experimental evidence from telescopic observations that the cosmological fine structure constant—which contains the speed of light—may have been different than its present value in the very early Universe.\n\nThe observations supported Moffat's VSL theory—and started a race for primacy that began in 1998.\n\nThat year, five years after Moffat had published his VSL papers, João Magueijo of Imperial College in London, and collaborators Andrew Albrecht of the University of California at Davis and John D. Barrow of Cambridge University, published a strikingly similar idea in the more prestigious journal, \"Physical Review D\", which had rejected Moffat's paper years earlier.\n\nInformed of the omission, Magueijo credited Moffat with an entire chapter in Magueijo's 2002 book, \"Faster Than the Speed of Light: The story of a scientific speculation.\"\n\nThe controversy reignited, however, when during a worldwide publicity tour for Magueijo's book, the author neither credited Moffat nor corrected numerous erroneous press accounts—in such magazines as \"Discover\", \"Publisher's Weekly\", \"Seed Magazine\" and the \"Christian Science Monitor\". In efforts to portray Magueijo as a \"brash, young scientific upstart,\" dozens of publications attributed VSL theory entirely to Magueijo and his co-authors, leaving Moffat—in his late sixties by this time—out. Moffat expressed displeasure about the re-emergent omissions, urging reporters to check their facts, but to no avail.\n\nStories emerged about the book tour media omissions in March and July 2003, written by a science journalist, Michael Martin, who had earlier attributed VSL theory to Moffat in a 2001 UPI article about Webb's astronomical discoveries. \"Discover Magazine\" writer Tim Folger acknowledged the omissions in his story and apologized. In response to a reader letter from Henry van Driel of the University of Toronto Department of Physics, Folger wrote, \"Professor van Driel is absolutely right—John Moffat did develop a varying speed of light theory several years before João Magueijo, and I regret not including that information in my story.\"\n\nMonths later, as other reports picked up on the reignited dispute, Magueijo reiterated Moffat's primacy in VSL theory. In September 2004, Discover Magazine's Tim Folger followed through on a promise he had made during the controversy to \"write a story about John Moffat.\"\n\nThe two physicists became friends, publishing a joint paper in 2007 in the journal \"General Relativity and Gravitation\".\n\nContinuing Einstein's search for a unified field theory, Moffat proposed a nonsymmetric gravitational theory that, like Einstein's unified field, incorporated a symmetric field (gravity) and an antisymmetric field. Unlike Einstein, however, Moffat made no attempt to identify the latter with electromagnetism, instead proposing that the antisymmetric component is another manifestation of gravity. As investigation progressed, the theory evolved in a variety of ways; most notably, Moffat postulated that the antisymmetric field may be massive.\n\nThe current version of his modified gravity (MOG) theory, which grew out of this investigation, modifies Einstein's gravity with the addition of a vector field, while also promoting the constants of the theory to scalar fields. The combined effect of these fields modifies the strength of gravity at large distances when large masses are involved, successfully accounting for a range of astronomical and cosmological observations. The resulting theory describes well, without invoking dark matter, the rotation curves of galaxies and the mass profiles of X-ray galaxy clusters.\n\nIn 1990, Moffat proposed a finite, non-local quantum field theory. The theory was developed extensively by Evens, Moffat, Kleppe and Woodard in 1991. In subsequent work, Moffat proposed this theory as an alternative to the standard electroweak unification of electromagnetism and the weak nuclear interactions. Moffat's theory is a quantum field theory with a non-local term in the field Lagrangian. The theory is gauge invariant and it is finite to all orders of perturbation theory. For the standard model it can solve the Higgs boson mass hierarchy naturalness problem. It also leads to a finite quantum gravity theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Toronto press releases re Moffat:\n"}

{"id": "1863317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863317", "title": "Mandø", "text": "Mandø\n\nMandø is one of the Danish Wadden Sea islands off the southwest coast of Jutland, Denmark in the Wadden Sea, part of the North Sea. The island covers an area of and had 40 inhabitants in January 2018. The island is part of Esbjerg Municipality and is situated approximately southwest of the ancient town of Ribe.\n\nMandø is barely accessible at high tide over an unpaved surface level causeway of about four kilometers in length that connects the island to the mainland. Extensive mudflats and tidal marshes encircle the island and provide breeding areas to multitudes of birds and other organisms. In the past centuries a large earthen dike has been constructed around the perimeter of the island, although substantially set back from the shoreline. This artifice has allowed conventional farming in the form of grain growing and sheep grazing. Mandø is technically a hallig, although it is far from the ten German islands commonly described by that term. The name was formerly often spelled Manø.\n\nConventional motor vehicles can access Mandø Island via a causeway unpaved roadway, although this route is compromised in storms at high tide. The nearest village on the mainland which is the gateway to Mandø Island is Vester Vedsted. This simple causeway road is no more than copious gravel laid down on an immense mudflat, with required frequent periodic maintenance of added gravels. Alternatively many visitors reach the island by way of a specially designed tractor pulled bus with greatly oversized tires. This vehicle is capable of traversing some of the firmer mudflats, but only at the lowest tides. In any case private vehicles or the \"Mandø bus\" leave the mainland at the point of the Wadden Sea Centre, which offers nature information and boasts a small museum devoted to the natural history of Mandø. Mandø is located midway between the two larger islands Fanø and Rømø which are connected to the mainland by a ferry and a road running across a causeway, respectively.\n\nMandø is geographically one of the northernmost islands among the North Frisian Islands off the southwestern Danish and northwestern German coast. The Frisian Islands are generally the line of demarcation separating the North Sea from the Wadden Sea, which is a shallow sea of approximately 5000 square kilometers in size, riddled with small islands and tidal flats. The entire Wadden Sea area was formed by intervening riverine depositional periods between Ice Age glacier movements.\n\nThe principal ecosystems on this island are: tidal marsh; mudflat; littoral zone; and upland grassland. In fact, there is about as much land area in mudflat as the considerable arable land of the island. Mandø Island is known for its extensive birdlife. Breeding birds consist of terns, sandpipers, many waders and ducks including eiders. Mudflats and marshes afford birds a safe and undisturbed location for feeding, resting and breeding.\n\nThere are also a variety of insects, marine organisms and small mammals that find habitat on this island. Many grasses and wildflowers populate the upland portion of the island, in addition to marsh grasses in the intertidal zone. Besides the indigenous wildlife there are sheep which are grazed on the island and along part of the causeway.\n\nThe first written record of Mandø dates from 1231. The meaning of the original name \"Mannæø\" or \"Mannø\" is disputed. According to one interpretation the name means the Isle of Men. It has also been interpreted as relating to a burial site for victims of shipwrecks. A number of islands in Sweden have similar names with this meaning. A third interpretation explains it as derived from the name \"Manni\".\n\nA local record, \"Avia Ripensis\" (), mentions the existence of a local church in 1340. The current building dates from 1727. The island belonged to the royal demesne until 1741 when the islanders purchased it at auction. Mandø remains sparsely populated compared to the neighbouring islands, Fanø and Rømø. The census of 1890 records the island's population as 262, a number which has now dwindled to c. 70.\n\nThe island has been hit by storm floods on several occasions. A dyke known as \"Bydiget\" ('village dyke') was constructed in 1887 east of the main settlement. A second one, \"Havnediget\" ('harbour dyke'), was constructed in 1937 protecting the northern part of the island, \"Gammel Mandø\" ('Old Mandø'). Both dykes were breached in a flood in 1981.\n\nLife on the island was first supported by a combination of agriculture and fishing. Fishing was the responsibility of the island's men and agriculture was managed by the women. The island was later associated with seafaring. In the 20th century, agriculture became the dominant activity. At its peak, the number of farms was 25, a number dwindling to a single one by 1997.\n\nEugenius Warming (1841-1924), recognized as a major founding figure of the scientific discipline of Ecology, was born and lived until about the age of three on the island.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863320", "title": "Tilaka", "text": "Tilaka\n\nIn Hinduism, the tilaka () is a mark worn usually on the forehead, sometimes other parts of the body such as neck, hand or chest. Tilaka may be worn daily or for rites of passage or special religious occasions only, depending on regional customs.\n\nThe term also refers to the Hindu ritual of marking someone's forehead with a fragrant paste, such as of sandalwood or vermilion, as a welcome and expression of honour when they arrive.\n\nThe tilaka is a mark created by the application of powder or paste on the forehead. Tilakas are vertical markings worn by Vaishnavites. The Vaishnava tilaka consists of a long vertical marking starting from just below the hairline to almost the end of one's nose tip, and they are also known as Urdhva Pundra. It is intercepted in the middle by an elongated U. There may be two marks on the temples as well. This tilaka is traditionally made with sandalwood paste.\n\nThe other major tilaka variant is often worn by the followers of Shiva, known by the names of Rudra-tilaka and Tripundra. It consists of three horizontal bands across the forehead with a single vertical band or circle in the middle. This is traditionally done with sacred ash from fire sacrifices. This variant is the more ancient of the two and shares many common aspects with similar markings worn across the world.\n\nShaktas, worshippers of the various forms of the Goddess (Devi), wear a large red dot of kumkum (vermillion or red turmeric) on the forehead.\n\nChapter 2 of the \"Kalagni Rudra Upanishad\", a Shaiva traditional text, explains the three lines of a Tilaka as a reminder of various triads: three sacred fires, three syllables in Om, three \"gunas\", three worlds, three types of \"atman\" (self), three powers in oneself, first three Vedas, three times of extraction of the Vedic drink Soma.\n\n\nThese lines, states Antonio Rigopoulos, represent Shiva’s threefold power of will (icchāśakti), knowledge (jñānaśakti), and action (kriyāśakti). The Tripuṇḍra described in this and other Shaiva texts also symbolises Shiva’s trident (triśūla) and the divine triad of Brahmā, Vishnu, and Shiva.\n\nThe Vasudeva Upanishad, a Vaishnava tradition text, similarly explains the significance of three vertical lines in \"Urdhva Pundra\" Tilaka to be a reminder of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva; the Vedic scriptures – Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda; three worlds Bhu, Bhuva, Svar; the three syllables of Om – A, U, M; three states of consciousness – awake, dream sleep, deep sleep; three realities – Maya, Brahman and Atman; the three bodies – Sthula, Sukshma, and Karana.\n\nDifferent Hindu traditions use different materials and shapes to make the tilaka.\n\n\n\nThe choice of style is not mandated in Hindu texts, and it is left to the individual and the regional culture, leading to many versions. The known styles include Vijayshree – white tilaka \"urdhwapundra\" with a white line in the middle, founded by Swami Balanand of Jaipur; Bendi tilaka – white tilak \"urdhwapundra\" with a white round mark in the middle, founded by Swami Ramprasad Acharya of Badasthan Ayodhya; and Chaturbhuji tilaka – white tilak \"urdhwapundra\" with the upper portion turned 90 degrees in the opposite direction, no \"shri\" in the middle, founded by Narayandasji of Bihar, ascetics of Swarg Dwar of Ayodhya follow it. Sharma has named additional styles as, Vallabh Sampraday Tilak, Sri Tilaka of Rewasa Gaddi, Ramacharandas Tilaka, Srijiwarama ka Tilaka, Sri Janakraja Kishori Sharan Rasik Aliji ka Tilaka, Sri Rupkalajee ka Tilaka, Rupsarasji ka Tilaka, Ramasakheeji ka Tilaka, Kamanendu Mani ka Tilaka, Karunasindhuji ka Tilaka, Swaminarayana Tilaka, Nimbarka ka Tilaka and Madhwa ka Tilaka.\n\nThe terms tilaka and bindi overlap somewhat, but are not synonymous. Among the differences:\n\nIt is also called tikli or sheether harr in Bengali, tika, or tilakam or tilak in Hindi; ; )\n\nIn Nepal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and other regions, the tilakam is called a \"tikā\"/\"teeka\" (टिका ), and is a mixture of \"sindoor\", a red powder, yoghurt, and grains of rice. The most common tikkas are red powder applied with the thumb, or sandalwood (\"chandan\") paste, in a single upward stroke.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to reports, Nancy Weiler was \"beaten almost beyond recognition\" by Davis with a .357 Magnum, and hit more than 25 times in the face and head. He was also convicted of killing Nancy Weiler's two daughters, Kristina, age 10, who was shot twice in the face, and Katherine, age 5, who was shot as she tried to run away and then had her skull beaten in with the gun. Davis was on parole for armed robbery at the time of the murders. He was executed on July 8, 1999.\n\nFor his last meal, Davis requested and received a dinner consisting of one lobster tail, fried potatoes, a half pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clams, half a loaf of garlic bread, and 32 ounces of Barq's Root Beer.\n\nDavis's execution drew nationwide media attention after he bled profusely from the nose while being electrocuted. Also during his time in the electric chair, Davis suffered burns to his head, leg, and groin area. A subsequent investigation concluded that Davis had begun bleeding before the first jolt of electricity was applied. He had been taking blood thinning medication for an unrelated health problem. It was concluded that the electric chair had functioned as designed and the Florida Supreme Court upheld electrocution as a means of capital punishment. However, a dissenting justice published photos of the aftermath of the incident in an attempt to argue that the practice of capital punishment by electrocution was outdated, and that any future executions should be carried out through lethal injection. In 1999, the state of Florida heard a petition from Thomas Harrison Provenzano, another death row inmate, that argued that the electric chair was a \"cruel and unusual punishment\". As of 2018, Davis was the last Florida inmate executed by electric chair. Since 2000, all subsequent executions were by lethal injection. Inmates, however, may still choose electrocution. As of 2019, only Wayne C. Doty has opted for death by electrocution.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863341", "title": "Singapore American School", "text": "Singapore American School\n\nSingapore American School (SAS) is a non-profit, independent, co-educational day school located in the Woodlands area of Singapore. It offers an American-based curriculum for students in preschool through high school. One of Singapore's first international schools, SAS was founded in 1956 and started with a hundred students in a colonial house. It has since developed into a school of over 4,000 students on a 36-acre campus. SAS is accredited by the US-based Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).\n\nThe SAS student body is made up of over 60 nationalities, with over half of the students being United States citizens. Singaporean student numbers are limited as Singapore government regulations prevent most local students from attending international schools within the country. The majority of the teachers come from the US, and staff members from twenty other countries also work at SAS. Most are hired overseas, and 80% hold master's degrees. The maximum number of students per class in preschool and pre-kindergarten is 16, while for kindergarten through grade 12 it is 22.\n\nSAS offers classes in the standard academic subjects as well as foreign languages, music, art, physical education, dance, sports, and technology. The high school offers over 20 AP courses, including the AP Capstone program. The campus has both air-conditioned and open-air spaces. Facilities include gyms, cafeterias, libraries, and theaters, as well as courtyards, playgrounds, playing fields, swimming pools, tennis courts, a rainforest, and an eco-garden.\n\nSingapore American School was established by the American Association of Malaya in January 1956. It was originally intended as a school for the children of American executives, missionaries, and diplomats who did not want to follow the British practice of sending school-aged children home to boarding schools. In the beginning, around a hundred elementary and junior-high students attended classes in a colonial house on Rochalie Drive, on the edge of downtown Singapore. High school classes were soon added, and the school grew quickly, attracting students from a wide variety of backgrounds.\n\nOver the next half-century, the school moved several times:\n\nBy the late 1980s, SAS again faced space constraints, as enrollment continued to outstrip capacity at both the King's Road and Ulu Pandan campuses. In addition, the Ulu Pandan lease would soon expire, and the Singapore government wanted the school to accommodate more students, as part of its push to attract foreign talent to help develop new industries. While SAS opened the temporary Baytree campus as a short-term solution, the government offered three sites for a brand-new campus, and the school selected a large plot in the developing Woodlands neighborhood. The school received a 90-year lease, with the stipulation that the new campus be able to accommodate 3,700 students. The site was developed at the cost of $150 million, and the Woodlands campus opened in the fall of 1996. To the surprise of many in the American community, enrollment quickly rose to capacity, and the western end of the campus had to be redeveloped into a new high school and early learning center, which opened in 2004.\n\nSAS is a non-profit, member-based independent school. It is incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and recognized under the Singapore Charities Act. Parents, guardians, teachers and administrators are members of the school unless they opt out; currently there are over 4,900 members. All members are invited to the annual general meeting (AGM) in October, at which the superintendent reviews the school's progress and finances. Members participate in school governance by electing the board of governors. These twelve parents of enrolled students serve in a volunteer capacity for terms of three years. The board is responsible for hiring the superintendent and providing strategic oversight for the school, while the superintendent and administrative team are responsible for the school's day-to-day operations.\n\nThe school's finances are managed by the chief operating officer under the guidance of the superintendent and board. An independent financial audit is conducted annually and presented at the AGM. The school maintains financial reserves and an endowment to ensure long-term financial stability. An investment advisory committee supports the board in managing these funds. Two philanthropic organizations support educational programs, operations, and capital initiatives at SAS. These are the SAS Foundation Limited (Singapore), and the Singapore American School Foundation (United States). The SAS Annual Fund solicits donations to these foundations from current and former parents and employees, as well as from SAS alumni and friends of the school. Foundations funds make possible special opportunities for students, as well as providing for the long-term financial health of the school.\n\nSAS is organized into three divisions: The elementary school (including the early learning center) for preschool through grade 5; the middle school for grades 6–8; and the high school for grades 9–12. The primary school, which included grades preschool-2, and the intermediate school, which included grades 3–5, were combined into the elementary school in 2014 to minimize transitions for students, support research and development work, and promote better co-ordination across divisions. A principal and deputy principals guide each division.\n\nThe SAS ELC (Early Learning Center) serves three- and four-year-old students in a self-contained set of learning hubs, activity spaces, and playgrounds adjacent to the high school. Students in preschool and pre-K have a shorter school day than those in the rest of the school. The ELC program is inspired by the Reggio Emilia schools in Italy. Two classes of 16 students each are combined to form a hub, and each hub is guided by two teachers and two teaching aides. Parent volunteers often help with classroom activities and projects.\n\nBesides spending time in their individual classrooms, students have two recesses every day, which take place on the two ELC playgrounds and in the large central hall. They also have a separate Chinese class and a perceptual motor class in the Move and Groove Room. Once a week students have library time in the ELC's own library corner. Students also have \"buddy time\" with older students, counseling lessons to develop social skills, and special celebrations. They eat in the high school cafeteria at a designated ELC-only lunchtime.\n\nStudents in the elementary school are organized into classes with a maximum of 22 students. Teachers are supported by instructional aides. Students receive instruction in reading, writing, math, social studies, and science in their classrooms. The elementary school’s literacy program is based on the Columbia Teachers’ College program, and students use the enVision math common core program. Outside their home classrooms, students attend their choice of daily Spanish or Chinese language classes. A Chinese-immersion program started in Kindergarten in August 2017. Art, music, and PE classes occur in a three-day rotational schedule, with library, science laboratory, technology, and counseling lessons at longer intervals.\n\nA 1:1 iPad program ensures that each K-5 student uses technology to support learning, and students have service learning opportunities based on grade-level themes. Special events include United Nations Day, PTA Book Fair, Halloween parties, winter holiday parties, Chinese New Year celebrations, and an end-of-year Play Day. Students in grades 3–5 may participate in the science fair. In each grade students go on several field trips. Destinations include the Singapore Zoo, Little India, the Asian Civilizations Museum, Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve, and various plays and theatre offerings. Parents are welcome to help in classrooms, as field trip chaperones, and with parties and special events throughout the year.\n\nThe elementary school occupies the eastern end of the SAS campus, and includes its own language, art, music, and science classrooms, as well as a library, an auditorium/theater, two pools, two gyms (one with a climbing wall), two cafeterias, and several playgrounds.\n\nThe SAS middle school offers a foundation of academic classes complemented by elective courses and after-school activities. “Homebase” meets every morning, giving each group of a dozen students a daily connection with one teacher. With over 900 students, the middle school is organized into teams, called A Side, B Side, and C Side, each supported by a set of teachers. These smaller groups within the large middle school are intended to help meet students’ social, emotional, and academic needs. Besides the required courses (reading and language arts, math, science, social studies, and PE/health) students may take Chinese, French, or Spanish, strings, band, or choir, or a selection of electives including drama, art, technology, and cooking.\n\nStudent learning is supported in a number of ways in the middle school. A 1:1 laptop program was implemented in 2013–14. \"Classroom Without Walls\" takes each grade level to a regional destination for several days in the first month of school, and students develop relationships with peers and staff. Learning support teachers, school counselors and the school psychologist work with small groups and individuals needing specialized support. The school uses a standards-based grading protocol.\n\nThe middle school occupies the central area of the SAS campus. Core classes are taught in classrooms grouped around large-group activity areas. Art, band, orchestra, choir, technology, cooking, health and dance occupy specially designed rooms. The middle school has its own playing field and library/media centre. Students share a 25-meter pool, gymnasiums, and fields with the high school, and eat in the open-air elementary-middle school cafeteria.\n\nThe SAS high school offers a foundation of academic classes complemented by elective courses and after-school activities. Like many US college preparatory schools, course requirements ensure a comprehensive liberal arts education. The “international perspective” central to the school's mission statement is reflected in academic offerings, service opportunities, and extracurricular activities. Students with different learning styles, interests, and skills are accommodated. In recent years, the high school has launched several programs to ensure student wellbeing and foster community spirit. These include the advisory program, the house system, and the reorganization of the counseling department into two offices: one for social, emotional, and academic counseling and one for college counseling.\n\nThe high school offers 180 course options, and class size averages 17.1 students. Required credits include English, math, science, social studies, visual and performing arts, physical education, and health education. American citizens must earn one credit in American Studies or US History. All students must take two years of a foreign language (Chinese, French, Japanese or Spanish) or demonstrate proficiency in another language. Students also participate in a weeklong \"Interim Semester\" every year. This is a required off-campus experience that provides high school students with experiences beyond the traditional classroom. Beginning with the class of 2018, all students must complete a Catalyst Project. Elective options include classes in technology, engineering and robotics, journalism and media, and independent studies. Students may also take specialist courses through the Global Online Academy; may enroll in SAS's Summer Semester program; may enroll as seniors in the yearlong, nontraditional Quest program, and may study abroad in China, France, Italy, or Spain through School Year Abroad.\n\nSAS currently offers 26 AP courses. Most SAS high school students participate in the program, with 92% of 2017 graduates having taken at least one AP exam. In May 2017, SAS students took 1,761 AP exams, with 93% receiving a score of 3 or higher, and 76% receiving a score of 4 or 5. SAS was selected as one of only twelve international schools to pilot the AP Capstone program during the 2014–15 school year. The high school also offers Advanced Topic (AT) courses. Developed by SAS teachers working with university professors, these courses meet college-level standards of rigor and depth while focussing on skill development, deep exploration, project based learning, and real-world applications.\n\nApproximately 395 faculty members work full-time at SAS. These teachers come from 21 different countries, with 59% being American and 13% Canadian. Other countries of origin include Australia, China, the United Kingdom, Singapore, New Zealand, and Spain. Eighty percent of SAS teachers have a master's degree in addition to a bachelor's degree, and 18 teachers hold a PhD. Teachers tend to be experienced, with over 70% having at least six years of teaching experience before arriving at SAS. SAS teachers' average stay at the school is 8.4 years. Currently, 60% of SAS teachers have over five years' tenure at the school, including 34% who have stayed a decade or more. The student-teacher ratio is 10.2:1, and class sizes are limited to 16 in the ELC and, with few exceptions, 22 for grades K–12.\n\nAll curriculum at SAS is standards-based and aligned to current recommendations of US professional associations. Faculty are organized into professional learning communities (PLCs) that set essential learning targets and develop common assessments. PLCs also refine academic offerings to ensure that all students are appropriately challenged and supported in their learning.\n\nSAS has identified seven critical skills it believes students need to be prepared for academic, professional, and interpersonal success in the twenty-first century. These seven \"desired student learning outcomes,\" or DSLOs, include content knowledge, cultural competence, character, collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creativity. Five \"core values\" are instilled in SAS students through programs, practices, and adult modeling. They include compassion, fairness, honesty, respect, and responsibility.\n\nSAS student test scores consistently show a high level of academic achievement. Students in grades 3 through 9 take the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessments in math, reading, and language use twice yearly. SAS students' average MAP scores are higher than average scores of students in the US and comparable regional international schools.\n\nSAS began offering Advanced Placement courses in 1968, and over the years it has developed an extensive AP program. Today, over 90% of high school students take at least one AP exam during their time at SAS. Offering around 25 AP courses each year, SAS has one of the largest AP programs of any school outside the US in the spring of 2017, SAS students took 1,761 AP exams, with 93% receiving a score of 3 or higher, and 76% receiving a score of 4 or 5. 337 SAS students received an AP Scholar award from the College Board. This award recognizes students who score 3 or higher on at least 3 AP exams.\n\nStudents graduating from SAS overwhelmingly go on to college or university, and the application process is supported by a comprehensive college counseling program. Of the class of 2017, 89% went directly on to college or university, with 8% completing Singapore's National Service requirement (applicable to male Singaporean citizens or permanent residents) and 3% taking a gap year. Of those going directly on to college, 85% chose a US institution, 6% went to Canada, and the remainder attended British, Australian, and Asian universities.\n\nSAS offers physical education classes across all divisions, starting with perceptual motor classes in the early grades. Younger students may participate in after-school sports through the Elementary Activities and Athletics (EAA) program, which offers weekday, pay-as-you-go classes such as soccer, baseball, and karate.\n\nMiddle school students have PE (including health lessons) every second day. The all-inclusive MS after-school program includes many sports opportunities. Representative teams in soccer, cross-country, rugby, badminton, basketball, volleyball, track and field, tennis and swimming require try-outs and compete against other teams in the Athletic Conference of Singapore International Schools (ACSIS), of which SAS is a founding member. Clubs and intramural teams offer climbing, ultimate frisbee, soccer, lacrosse, table-tennis, dodgeball, basketball, volleyball, and cricket.\n\nHigh school athletes try out for boys’ and girls’ freshman/reserve, junior varsity, and varsity teams, depending on age and ability. Sports include cross-country, soccer, volleyball, basketball, rugby, touch rugby, swimming, tennis, badminton, golf, softball, and track and field. Teams compete against ACSIS teams, teams from local schools, community teams, and sometimes teams from other international schools in the region. Besides playing locally, varsity teams participate in the Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asia (IASAS). This organization, composed of six international schools with similar histories, was founded in 1982 to provide an organized, co-ordinated athletic conference for international competitions. Besides SAS, IASAS includes the International School of Kuala Lumpur, the International School of Bangkok, the Intercultural School of Jakarta, the International School of Manila, and Taipei American School. Each sport's season culminates with a competitive final tournament at one of the IASAS schools, hosted on a rotating schedule. Students stay with host school families, and develop both rivalries and friendships with the competition.\n\nSAS students have many other sporting options. The SAS Community Sports and Activities (CSA) program offers sports such as baseball, swimming, volleyball, and soccer after school and on weekends. American football enthusiasts can play in the Singapore American Football League (SAFL), organized by the Singapore American Community Action Council (SACAC). Many SAS students participate in local teams and leagues, or take lessons from private coaches or through Singapore social clubs such as the American Club.\n\nStudents in the elementary school have a range of after-school options available to them through the EAA program. This provides pay-as-you-go participation in a number of extra classes in areas such as music, arts and crafts, and cooking.\n\nMiddle school students participate in teacher-led after-school activities at no extra cost. These include activities such as Caring for Cambodia, National History Day Club, Chess Club, Spanish Language Club, and Junior Model United Nations. Middle school students may also audition for the annual fall dance show and the annual spring play or musical. SAS National History Day Club students won prizes in the Junior Group Project division at the National History Day competitions in 2015 and 2016.\n\nHigh school students run and participate in more than ninety clubs, organizations, and activities. These span a wide variety of interests and talents, and include athletic clubs, academic honor societies, academic interest clubs, environmental clubs, fine arts activities, language and cultural clubs, media and publications, music, dance, and theatre performances, service clubs, social clubs, and student government. SAS high school students participate in Model United Nations and compete in a variety of math competitions as well as Knowledge Bowl and Academic Quiz Club. Students compete in debate and forensics in the annual IASAS Cultural Conventions, which also include dance, drama, art and music. Student editors of \"The Eye\" school newspaper won the Straits Times National Youth Media Competition in 2014. In June 2017, six SAS high school students were the first in Singapore to send a science experiment to the International Space Station.\n\nCommunity service has been part of the SAS experience since students began volunteering at a local hospital in the 1960s. Currently, the emphasis at all levels is for students to have hands-on service experiences. Elementary students participate in local charities’ efforts by visiting local schools and care homes and conducting fund-raisers like walkathons and readathons. Middle school students support causes they learn about in social studies and science classes, and also design independent service projects. Over half the high school extracurricular organizations are service clubs, such as Migrant Workers Outreach Program, Leprosy Home, Blue Planet Initiative, Medical Explorers Club, Global Issues Network, and Youth for Girls. Elected high school students make up the Executive Service Council, an umbrella organization providing logistical and funding support for service clubs. Student fundraisers, parent organizations, and philanthropic donors also provide funding for service club efforts.\n\nSAS incorporates environmental initiatives in its facilities planning and classroom activities. Sustainability measures include a large photovoltaic array, the conversion of a formerly air-conditioned cafeteria to an open-air space, enhancements to the school's rain forest and eco-garden, and the installation of low-flow faucets, more efficient chillers, and \"green walls.\" The school's one-megawatt solar photovoltaic system includes nearly 3,500 panels on the school's rooftops, and earned the school a 2013 Solar Pioneer Award from Singapore's Economic Development Board. Singapore's Building and Construction Association awarded SAS a Green Mark \"Gold\" Award for sustainability in 2013. Student participation in the school's sustainability includes science projects studying how to cut down on paper-towel usage, student clubs running recycling efforts, and students helping with island-wide efforts such as the annual Coastal Cleanup Day.\n\nSAS students eat in three cafeterias: the elementary school cafeteria for grades K-2; the elementary-middle school cafeteria for grades 3–8; and the high school cafeteria, where the early learning centre children also eat in a designated area. Food provider Hoe Brothers Catering has been working with the school since the 1960s, and alumni remember signature dishes with fondness. High school students also have the choice of purchasing food from on-campus outlets such as Subway and Baja Fresh.\n\nThe SAS cafeterias provide a variety of meals, including Asian, Western, and vegetarian options. Younger students buy set meals, while older students can choose from set meals or a la carte items. SAS works with a school nutritionist, and in recent years has moved toward alignment with USDA standards for school meals and snacks. Healthy changes include increasing amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in meals, using healthier oils and less sugar and salt, and eliminating sodas and sugary drinks from campus. In 2014, these changes were featured in an episode of MediaCorp Channel 5's TV show \"The Food Detectives\".\n\nThe PTA was founded in the same year as the school, and continues to encourage community participation in school events and support student learning opportunities. It is a separate legal entity with an elected board, and membership is automatic for school families and faculty members. The PTA organizes classroom holiday parties, field trip chaperones, and special community events such as the Open House Ice Cream Social, the International Fair, and informative parent coffees. Volunteers also run the on-campus uniform store. Funds raised by the PTA support visiting authors and artists, library acquisitions, and scholarships.\n\nThe SAS Eagles Booster Club is a parent organization that supports SAS high school students. It started in 1985 to support student athletic teams, and quickly expanded its mission to include boosting school spirit and promoting teamwork and sportsmanship. Volunteers run the Booster Booth, which sells high school uniforms, spirit items, and school supplies. They also organize barbecues, spirit events, scholar luncheons, and the annual Trivia Night. Funds raised by the Boosters are used to support student clubs, productions, and teams, recognize academic achievements, and provide scholarships.\n\nSAS occupies a 36-acre parcel of land near Singapore's northern coast. Opened in 1996 and expanded in 2004, the Woodlands campus is divided into three divisions: the elementary school for preschool through grade 5; the middle school for grades 6–8; and the high school for grades 9–12. School facilities include air-conditioned classrooms and purpose-designed spaces for science, language, music, drama, dance, art and cooking classes. The campus is about a 25-minute drive from downtown Singapore.\n\nOther facilities of note include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863343", "title": "Florence Knoll", "text": "Florence Knoll\n\nFlorence Marguerite Knoll Bassett (née Schust; May 24, 1917 – January 25, 2019) was an American architect, interior designer, furniture designer, and entrepreneur who has been credited with revolutionizing office design and bringing modernist design to office interiors. Knoll and her husband, Hans Knoll, built Knoll Associates into a leader in the fields of furniture and interior design. She worked to professionalize the field of interior design, fighting against gendered stereotypes of the decorator. She is known for her open office designs, populated with modernist furniture and organized rationally for the needs of office workers. Her modernist aesthetic was known for clean lines and clear geometries that were humanized with textures, organic shapes, and color.\n\nFlorence Marguerite Schust was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Frederick Emanuel (1881–1923) and Mina Matilda (Haist) Schust (1884–1931), and was known in familiar circles as \"Shu\". Frederick Schust was born about 1882 in either Switzerland or Germany, was a native German speaker, and the 1920 United States Federal Census describes him as the superintendent of a commercial bakery. Mina was born about 1887 in Michigan, and her parents had been born in Canada. Knoll was orphaned at a young age, her father died when she was 5, her mother died when she was 12. She was placed under the care of Emile Tessin, who had been designated by Mina Schust as Knoll's legal guardian in the event of her death. Tessin made arrangements for Knoll to attend boarding school. After visiting, Knoll recalls feeling the Cranbrook educational community was the right place for her. \n\nKnoll attended Kingswood School for Girls (1932-1934), part of the Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. There she was mentored by Rachel de Wolfe Raseman, the art director at Kingswood. Together they designed a home which integrated interior and exterior, sparking her interest in architecture and bringing her to the attention of Eliel Saarinen, the Cranbrook Academy of Art President. Eliel and Loja Saarinen practically adopted Knoll; she spent summers with the family in Finland and befriended their son, Eero Saarinen who even gave her impromptu architectural history lessons. She attended the architecture department at Cranbrook Academy of Art for one year in 1934–35, In 1935, she studied town planning at the School of Architecture at Columbia University. She returned to Michigan in 1936 to undergo surgery and enrolled in the architecture department at Cranbrook again. From 1936-37, she explored furniture-making with Eero Saarinen and Charles Eames. In the summer of 1938 she met Alvar Aalto, who praised Architectural Association in London as a \"terrific school,\" Knoll went on to attended from 1938-1939. There she enjoyed the focus on studio work and was influenced by Le Corbusier's International style. She left as World War II was spreading.\n\nFrom 1940-1941, Knoll furthered her architectural educations under leading figures of the Bauhaus movement. In 1940, she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and worked briefly as an unpaid apprentice for Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Though her studies had been repeatedly interrupted by ill health and international events, Knoll was determined to finish her degree. She enrolled at the Chicago Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in fall 1940. She went to specifically study under Mies van der Rohe and received a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1941. Knoll's design approach was profoundly influenced by Mies, resulting in clarified designs with rigorous geometries.\n\nAfter graduating Knoll moved to New York in 1941, taking jobs with several New York architects, including Harrison & Abramovitz. \"Being a woman, I was given interiors,\" Knoll stated about her time at Harrison & Abramovitz. While there, she worked with Hans Knoll to design an office for Harry Stimson. Afterwards she continued the partnership, moonlighting as a designer for the Hans G. Knoll Furniture Company, which included designing their showroom. In 1943, she joined the Hans Knoll's company and founded their interior design service, the Knoll Planning Unit. She and Hans Knoll were married in 1946, when she became a full business partner and the company became known Knoll Associates, Inc.\n\nThe pairing led to success as Florence Knoll helped Hans Knoll turn what was a small furniture company into an international powerhouse. Florence Knoll was the design force and Hans Knoll was entrepreneurial and charismatic. A new furniture factory was established in East Greenville, Pennsylvania, and dealers of Knoll's furniture were carefully added over the next several years. Knoll Showrooms and retailers expanded internationally, by 1960 the company was doing $15 million dollars of business annually. The Knoll showrooms embodied their humanized modern designs, showing customers how to use their new furniture. Their first showroom was opened in 1948 in New York City followed by those in Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris, Los Angeles, Southfield, Michigan and other cities. The company expanded internationally forming Knoll International in 1951, as well as moved into textiles, forming Knoll Textiles.\n\nKnoll felt architects should contribute their design ability to furniture as well, and she brought her international connections, designer friends, and former teachers to Knoll. She managed to get architects including Eero Saarinen, Marcel Breuer, Pierre Jeanneret and Hans Bellman to design furniture for Knoll. Famously, Knoll asked Saarinen to design a chair that was \"like a great big basket of pillows that I can curl up in,\" resulting in his classic Womb chair. Knoll and Saarinen had to work with a fiberglass boat builder in order to manufacture the chair. Knoll persuaded her former teacher, Mies van der Rohe, to give Knoll the rights to the Barcelona Chair which he had designed with Lilly Reich in 1929. Knoll also tapped artists to create furniture, such as Isamu Noguchi, whose cyclone table (1950) became a Knoll replica. Knoll had the sculptor, Harry Bertoia spend two years in his studio to see if he could translate his metal work into furniture resulting in his well known wire chairs. She managed to attract Knoll's considerable stable of designer talent by paying commissions and royalties and ensuring credit for designs.\n\nWhen Hans Knoll died in a car accident in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as president of all three Knoll companies (Knoll Associates, Knoll Textiles, and Knoll International). She sold the companies to Art Metal Construction Company in 1959, though continued on as president of all three companies until 1960. In 1960, she moved to Florida with her second husband, Harry Hood Bassett. However, she stayed in charge of design for all of Knoll until 1965. In the ten years since she had taken primary responsibility for Knoll, she had doubled the size of the company, making into one of the most influential design companies in the world.\n\nFlorence Knoll created the interior design service of Knoll Associates (The Knoll Planning Unit) in 1943 and directed its activities until 1965, the unit closed down 1971. The Planning Unit at first designed Knoll Showrooms, arranging furniture and accessories to showcase the firm's designs and demonstrate how to use the furniture, Knoll Showrooms became an essential part in convincing clients to adopt Knoll's modernist aesthetic. During the post-war period, the United States experienced an office building boom, and the Knoll Planning Unit was well positioned to take advantage as it began offering innovative full-service design solutions for office interiors including everything from space planning to furniture selection. Knoll also advanced the science of office design, not just decorating the space, but analyzing the client's work requirements and designing functional spaces that would meet these needs. Knoll conducted interviews to identify clients' work needs through interviews. The Unit completed over 70 office interiors, including the offices of major American companies such as IBM, GM, Look magazine, Seagram, Heinz, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, and CBS. The Unit's breakthrough came from designing for the CBS president, Frank Stanton, who had been impressed by the Knoll Showrooms. Stanton promoted Knoll design to his contacts, and Knoll shrewdly promoted their work for CBS through architecture and design magazines. The Planning Unit typically ran on a very small team, typically only 8 designers and 2 drafters on staff, and even as the volume of projects dramatically increased, the staff only grew to around 20 employees. Knoll provided extensive education and mentoring to the designers that worked under her, and many of the Knoll Planning Unit designers went on to found interior divisions at architectural firms such as SOM. The preparation and training of interior designers earned the Planning Unit the moniker \"Shu U\" after Knoll's nickname.\n\nKnoll and her Knoll Planning Unit has been credited with revolutionizing office design and environments, replacing antique styles and haphazard arrangements with the signature \"Knoll Look,\" marked by rationalized space plans, modern furniture, sleek geometries, and an integration of structure, color, and texture. In the 1940s office decoration had been dominated by antique and period styles. Offices typically had traditional, heavy, carved, mahogany desks placed diagonally in the corner of a room, another diagonal table behind it, chairs scattered, and a glassed-in bookcase. Knoll replaced the old executive desk with light and sleek modern designs, as well as straightening its diagonal positioning. Work spaces were made to be more open with sitting areas for informal discussion. She redesigned conference tables into a boat-shape so that people could see one another to accommodate group discussions. She often employed floating open-riser staircases and multilevel interiors, drawing on her architectural background. \n\nKnoll radically transformed interior space planning creating a \"total design\" or \"Bauhaus approach\" where interior architecture, furniture, lighting, textiles, and art were integrated. The unit created some of the most innovative design for office interiors during the post-war period, largely due to Knoll's design aesthetic of humanized modernism, in which Knoll brought color and texture to interiors inspired by modernism, making them more comfortable for everyday use. This \"softer modernism\" with color and organic shapes, which was also practiced by Charles and Ray Eames as well as Eero Saarinen, was more appealing to a general public. Knoll brought in architecture, ergonomics, efficiency, and space planning to her comprehensive interior designs. The NY Times critic, Paul Goldberger, said she “probably did more than any other single figure to create the modern, sleek, postwar American office, introducing contemporary furniture and a sense of open planning into the work environment.” In 1957, Architectural Forum said \"the Knoll interior is as much a symbol of modem architecture as Tiffany glass was a symbol of the architecture of Art Nouveau.\" \n\nOne of Knoll's main challenges was convincing executives and the public to adopt a modernist aesthetic. Knoll Showrooms played a key room in selling the public on modernist design, but Knoll was also gifted at convincing executives to hire Knoll to transform their offices. Knoll was renowned for her how she communicated and presented the designs of the Knoll Planning Unit through what she referred to as \"paste-ups\". A \"paste-up\" was a general graphic-arts term for any draft or finished mechanical flat art, traditionally using an adhesive commonly used in fashion and set design. Knoll was the first to use the method for interior design presentation. Her paste-ups were small representational plans of the space with fabric swatches, wood chips and finishes attached to represent furniture and other details. Knoll used the paste-ups to convey the feeling and experience of the space, in the pictured example the color and texture of the materials used better represented the humanized modernism that was essential to Knoll's designs. The paste-ups were essential in overcoming resistance to change, they gave executives something they could identify with, making them feel comfortable in adopting Knoll's new aesthetics. \n\nKnoll designed furniture when the existing pieces in the Knoll collection didn't meet her needs. She described her pieces as the \"meat and potatoes,\" the filler among the flashier pieces in the Knoll collection. Knoll stated that she was not a furniture designer, perhaps because she didn't want her furniture pieces to be viewed on their own but rather as an element of her holistic interior design. Nonetheless, almost half of the furniture pieces in the Knoll collection were her designs including tables, desks, chairs, sofas, benches and stools.\n\nShe designed furniture not only to be functional but also to designate the functions of interior space as well as relate to the architecture of the space and its overall composition. The distinctive features of Knoll's furniture designs were their sleek silhouettes and clear geometries, reflecting her architectural training and interests. Her furniture was designed with the notion of transforming architecture into furniture, which she achieved by translating the structure and language of the modern building into a human-scaled object.\n\nBefore Knoll's influence Interior decoration was mostly a non-professional pursuit, typically practiced by hobbyists. It had previously only been applied to the home, spaces like offices were not typically professionally planned or designed. Knoll saw an opportunity, when she realized that most office spaces were not professionally designed:In those days the boss usually had a decorator. They did his office and maybe some of the other senior executives, but the people further down the line had offices designed by the purchasing agent, who ordered furniture out of a catalog. So when I came along with my questionnaire, I wanted to know what they needed. It was kind of a radical ideal, but it was also logical and obvious.With her Knoll Planning Unit, Knoll radically shifted interior design to be a professional endeavor. Knoll fused decoration with architecture and industrial design ad applied it to commercial office space, this fusion has continued to be at the core of modern professional interior design. Knoll was aware of the shift she was creating, in an interview with the \"New York Times\" in 1964, Knoll state \"I am not a decorator... the only place I decorate is my own house.\" She took this stance to differentiate the titles of an interior decorator and an interior designer. Knoll was one of the first to make this differentiation, frustrated at the title of interior decorator especially in its gendered connotation and concomitant lack of status and respect. She felt expertise in furniture design and architecture exceed the common skill of an interior decorator.\n\nIn 1961 she became the first woman to receive the Gold Medal for Industrial Design from the American Institute of Architects. In 1983 she won the Athena Award of the Rhode Island School of Design. She was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame in 1985. In 2003, President George W. Bush presented her with the nation's highest award for artistic excellence, the National Medal of Arts. In 2004 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Vermont.\n\nShe married Hans Knoll in 1946; he died in a car crash in 1955. In 1958 she married Harry Hood Bassett, the son of Harry H. Bassett. On 25 January 2019, Florence Marguerite Knoll Bassett died at age 101 in Coral Gables, Florida.\n\n"}

As the daughter of Aurelian \"Grizzly\" Smith, she is a second-generation wrestler. Her brother Sam Houston and half-brother Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts are also wrestlers. Smith worked for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the 1980s. She held the WWF Women's Championship from October 1988 until it was retired in 1990. She then worked on the independent circuit.\n\nSmith grew up in a wrestling family and enjoyed going to wrestling shows, where she claims she and her siblings were treated like celebrities. Smith later decided to become a professional wrestler and trained, along with her sister-in-law Nickla Roberts (known by her ring name Baby Doll), under Nelson Royal. During 1987, Smith competed as Rockin' Robin in Wild West Wrestling, where she feuded with Debbie Combs and Sue Green. When the WWF decided to restart their women's division in the late 1980s, both women tried out for the company, but the role ultimately went to Smith. Smith, as Rockin' Robin, debuted in the WWF in late 1987. She competed at the first Survivor Series as a member of The Fabulous Moolah's team. Throughout 1988, she feuded with Sensational Sherri for the WWF Women's Championship.\n\nOn October 7, 1988, she defeated Sensational Sherri, who had held the title for fifteen months prior, for the Women's Championship in Paris. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, she defended the title against Judy Martin. Smith defended the belt against Martin for the first six months of 1989. In the meantime, at WrestleMania V, she sang \"America the Beautiful\" to open the show. Smith continued to defend the Women's title against Martin throughout the summer of 1989. She held the championship until 1990, when she left the company. At that time, the title was retired by the WWF due to inactivity. Smith is still in possession of the title belt. The title remained inactive until 1993.\n\nUnlike some former WWF wrestlers, Smith was able to continue using her ring name after leaving the company because she owned the rights to it. In 1990, wrestler Hiro Matsuda, who had feuded with her father in the 1960s, picked Smith to tour for All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling. In Japan, Smith teamed with Luna Vachon. The Japanese bookers gave the girls a positive review for their work with the company.\n\nIn the United States, Smith defeated Peggy Lee Leather for the Ladies Major League Wrestling's International Championship. She still occasionally defended the WWF Women's Championship, even though the title was officially declared vacant by the World Wrestling Federation. In May 1991 she defended the WWF Women's Championship against \"Japanese Women's Champion\" Madusa Miceli on a Great Lakes Wrestling Association event. On June 9, 1991, she defeated Candi Devine in Herb Abrams's Universal Wrestling Federation to become the first UWF Women's Champion at UWF Beach Brawl. She also competed in the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association (LPWA), forming a tag team with Wendi Richter. She competed at LPWA's only pay-per-view, LPWA Super Ladies Showdown.\n\nSmith and her brother Sam Houston are the children of Aurelian \"Grizzly\" Smith and were born after his first marriage dissolved. Her half-brother is Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, who was born during their father's first marriage. Robin and her brothers all wrestled in the WWF at the same time in the 1980s, but their relationship was never mentioned on-screen at the request of Robin. Author and former National Wrestling Alliance president Howard Brody alleges in his book \"Swimming with Piranhas\" that Robin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her father. According to Brody, Robin was removed from her father's care when her mother discovered what had been happening.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF in 1990, Smith was married to a man named Harvey Zitron. Zitron was sentenced to 81 months in federal prison for 10 counts of filing false tax returns, identity theft and access device fraud. After divorcing, she moved to Louisiana and opened a telemarketing company that sold industrial chemicals and precious metals. Later, she opened a real estate appraisal business. During this time, Smith had a drinking problem but eventually was able to quit altogether.\n\nIn 2005, Smith's home and all of her belongings were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. During the aftermath of the hurricane, she stayed with family in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She now runs a real estate appraisal business in Hammond, Louisiana.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863355", "title": "Monarch's Way", "text": "Monarch's Way\n\nThe Monarch's Way is a long-distance footpath in England that approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated in the Battle of Worcester. It runs from Worcester via Bristol and Yeovil to Brighton.\nAll of the footpath is waymarked. The waymark is yellow and shows a picture of the ship \"Surprise\" above the Prince of Wales three-point feathered crown which is superimposed on a Royal Oak tree (which is at Boscobel House) in black.\n\nThis route is shown as a series of green diamonds on the Ordnance Survey (larger scale) 1:25000 maps and of red diamonds on its 1:50000 maps.\n\nFrom its starting point at Worcester the route travels north to Boscobel and then south to Stratford upon Avon. It then continues south to Stow on the Wold before turning south west towards Bristol via Cirencester.\n\nSouth of Bristol the route is almost directly south across the Mendip Hills to Wells, continues through Somerset almost to Yeovil and then south west to Charmouth in Dorset. There is then a short section along the Dorset coast before turning north again to Yeovil, before turning east and following much of the escarpment of Cranborne Chase, the Hampshire Downs and South Downs to Shoreham-by-Sea where it has a short extension to neighbouring Brighton and Hove, being its historic port and today a main yachting centre in Sussex.\n\nThe Monarch's Way is an approximation of the King's route using available public rights of way and visiting places noted in the historic records. Most of the route has been radically changed in the intervening centuries by enclosure, mining, urbanisation and the building of roads, canals and railways. Use of canals and disused railways allows a more pleasant walk than taking to the public highway and provides an insight into industrial history particularly of the Black Country.\n\nA memorial near Powick Bridge commemorates the thousands of Scots who perished in the Royalist cause at the Battle of Worcester. Powick Bridge saw both the first and last engagements of the English Civil War. From here the footpath follows the banks of the River Teme and River Severn across the battlefield to enter the 'Faithful City' of Worcester . The King watched the battle unfold from the tower of the cathedral before fleeing with Colonel Charles Giffard of Chillington and others.\n\nThe Monarch's Way leaves the city past the Commandery, now a museum, on the towpath of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal then crossing to the Droitwich Canal, to Droitwich. Heading north it passes Chaddesley Corbett and Hagley on its way to Stourbridge. Here it joins the towpath of the Stourbridge Canal negotiating the four locks at Stourton to join the Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal. Continuing north along the canal to the Bratch Locks at Wombourne to pick up the trackbed of the former Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway now the South Staffordshire Railway Walk to Oaken. Leaving the railway the northerly route continues passing Pendrell Hall and Boscobel to White Ladies Priory. The King was hidden overnight in the house by Richard Pendrell.\n\nThe next part of the route traces the King's unsuccessful attempt to cross the River Severn to escape into Wales. Leaving White Ladies and the nearby Pendrell home at Hubbal Grange the route turns west via Tong to Evelith Mill and Kemberton. Reaching Madeley it became apparent that the river crossings were well guarded and the King spent a night in the 'Royal Barn' before beating a hasty retreat. Retracing the route through Norton and Beckbury to Boscobel House where the King hid in an oak tree to avoid capture. A descendant of the Royal Oak stands in the grounds of the English Heritage property.\n\nAn alternative plan was hatched for the King's escape and the path now heads east. Crossing the grounds of Chillington Hall and using sections of the Shropshire Union Canal and Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal it reaches Moseley Old Hall, now a National Trust property, where the King was hidden in a 'Priest hole'. From Moseley Old Hall the King left in the night for Bentley Hall with Colonel Lane. The Monarch's Way passes Northycote Farm and Essington before entering the fringe of the urban West Midlands. The route follows the Wyrley & Essington Canal the 'Curly Wyrley' and the ancient forest at Rough Wood to reach Bentley Hall at Bentley, West Midlands.\nThe Monarch's Way picks up the closed Anson Branch Canal. This section of the Monarch's Way follows the canal system through the heart of the Black Country using Walsall Canal, Wednesbury Old Canal, Netherton Tunnel and Dudley Canal to Halesowen.\n\nBromsgrove, Headless Cross, Alcester, Wootton Wawen, Snitterfield, Welcombe Hills Country Park\n\nFinally following the canal until it joins the River Avon in the centre of Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon is the start of this leg of the Monarch's Way. Following the west bank of the River Avon south and passing Holy Trinity Church, with its connections to William Shakespeare. Crossing both the River Avon then the River Stour near to Stratford racecourse. The path then follows the route of the Honeybourne Line to Long Marston. Leaving east on the route of the Heart of England Way and passing through Lower Quinton and Upper Quinton to meet with the Centenary Way which it follows east round Meon Hill at the start of the Cotswolds. Leaving the Centenary Way in a south westerly direction it enters Gloucestershire and passes Hidcote Manor Garden, owned by the National Trust, before rejoining the Heart of England Way. The path crosses Campden Tunnel on the Cotswold railway line and enters the market town of Chipping Campden.\n\nMoreton-in-Marsh, Stow-on-the-Wold, Northleach, Cirencester, Tetbury, Chipping Sodbury, Wick.\nThe Monarch's Way enters Somerset, having crossed the River Avon at Keynsham, where it diverts from the route taken by Charles II into Bristol and instead runs alongside the River Chew, where it shares the route with the Two Rivers Way, through the Chew Valley to Chewton Keynsham, Compton Dando and Woollard. It then crosses the river at Pensford and turns north to Norton Malreward, skirting the prehistoric henge monument of Stanton Drew stone circles, the second largest stone circle in Britain, and travels along Dundry Down to the village of Dundry. From Dundry there is a northerly loop to Leigh Court at Abbots Leigh where Charles II stayed on the night of 12 September 1651. The path then returns to Dundry and heads turns south to Winford and passes Regil before passing between Chew Valley Lake and Blagdon Lake to Compton Martin, where it climbs up into the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, passing East Harptree before entering the Forestry Commission plantation Stock Hill. On leaving the woods the path skirts the Priddy Mineries and Priddy Pools Site of Special Scientific Interest and continues south to Wookey Hole before entering the city of Wells, where it passes the Cathedral and Bishop's Palace.\n\nSouth of Wells the Monarch's Way crosses the River Sheppey and passes through Twinhills Woods and Meadows before entering North Wootton, continuing across the Somerset Levels and the A361 and A37 roads, through East Pennard, to Hornblotton. It then crosses the River Alham and travels east crossing the River Brue and the A371 before entering Castle Cary.\n\nSouth Cadbury, Trent, Dorset\n\nThe King was sheltered by Colonel Wyndham at Trent Manor House. The next part of the journey leads down to the Dorset coast where a ship had been found to take the King to France.\nAt Montacute the Monarch's Way passes in front of the Grade I listed Abbey Farmhouse, which incorporates the gateway of the medieval Montacute Priory.\n\nHam Hill, Crewkerne, Drimpton, Hawkchurch, Charmouth The King stayed overnight on 22 September 1651 at the Queen's Armes before taking passage. Unfortunately the plan fell through and the King beat a hasty retreat inland returning to Trent.\n\nFrom Charmouth the Monarch's Way follows the South West Coast Path east along the Jurassic Coast of Dorset past St Gabriel's Mouth, over Golden Cap, the highest point on the south coast, through Seatown, over Thorncombe Beacon and past Eype's Mouth to West Bay. From here it heads north up the River Brit to Bridport, swinging west and north to Pilsdon Pen, briefly joining the Wessex Ridgeway eastwards before reaching Broadwindsor. The King hid overnight in the George Inn, Broadwindsor on 23 September 1651.\n\nFrom here it continues eastwards to the north of Beaminster, before zig-zagging north and east to Winyard's Gap near Chedington, where it meets the head of the River Parrett Trail. Continuing north the path enters Somerset and passes Hardington Marsh, swinging east from Hardington Mandeville to East Coker and then north through Yeovil and Mudford.\n\nCrossing the River Yeo and back into Dorset, the path returns like the King to Trent. The King stayed here before setting out for the south coast and exile in France.\n\nSkirting north of Sherborne to Sandford Orcas then re-entering Somerset the path passes to the south of Corton Denham to Charlton Horethorne and South Cheriton, then north to pass under the A303 to Wincanton. From here it continues north-east to Penselwood.\n\nAfter crossing the Stour Valley Way and River Stour, the path enters Wiltshire at Zeals. From here it crosses the A303 dual carriageway and passes Zeals House before reaching Mere, passing West Knoyle and climbing Cleeve Hill. Crossing the A350, the path continues east to Hindon, Berwick St. Leonard, Fonthill Bishop and through part of Grovely Wood to reach Great Wishford. Here it crosses the River Wylye to Stoford before heading north and east near Stapleford to cross the A360, dropping down into the valley of the Avon at Middle Woodford before crossing at Lower Woodford. Traversing the country to the north of Salisbury, the path next crosses the A345 and the River Bourne at Winterbourne Dauntsey. After passing Figsbury Ring the path crosses the A30, to follow the course of the former Roman road from Winchester to Old Sarum. As it approaches Middle Winterslow, the path is joined by the Clarendon Way, the two paths following the Roman road over the county boundary.\n\nEntering Hampshire, the Monarch's Way and Clarendon Way continue to run together over the chalk through Broughton, crossing the River Test at Houghton. East of the Test the Clarendon Way continues east towards King's Somborne, whilst the Monarch's Way joins the Test Way, heading south down the Test Valley along the bed of the former Sprat and Winkle Line past Horsebridge. The two paths re-cross the Test to Mottisfont, heading south to cross the River Dun at Kimbridge, where the Test Way continues south and the Monarch's Way heads east to cross the Test again to the \"Bear & Ragged Staff\" and climbs to Michelmersh. From here eastwards for many miles the route skirts the northern rim of the Tertiary sediments of the Hampshire Basin, alternating between chalk downs to the north and heaths and woodland to the south. From Braishfield, the route crosses the wet clay of Ampfield Wood, passing through the hamlet of Knapp to the north of Ampfield, before heading for Hursley. The path continues east through the hamlets of Bunstead and Silkstead, passing under the M3 and passing the station at Shawford. Here the path crosses the Itchen Way before crossing the River Itchen to Twyford. West of Twyford the path crosses more chalk downs, now part of the South Downs, to Owslebury, before using short sections of Roman road in places to reach Upham. East of Upham the path heads northward for some miles, before joining the South Downs Way (and briefly the Wayfarers Walk) heading east. At Beacon Hill, the Monarch's Way takes a route north of the hill to Warnford, whilst the South Downs Way splits into alternative routes to Warnford or Exton. After crossing the River Meon and A32 the two routes rejoin further east before climbing Old Winchester Hill. To the east the routes diverge, with the South Downs Way continuing eastwards and the Monarch's Way heading south to the Bat & Ball Inn, Clanfield, then west past Broadhalfpenny Down towards Hambledon, before again striking east to Horndean. After crossing the town and A3(M), the path crosses The Holt to Rowland's Castle, where it passes the station.\nEntering West Sussex with the Sussex Border Path at Stansted Park, the Monarch's Way passes through Walderton and Stoughton, crossing Stoughton Down to West Dean. Here it crosses the A286 and River Lavant before climbing to the Trundle, on top of St Roche's Hill. Continuing east along a ridge the path passes Goodwood Racecourse and Goodwood Country Park. East of Goodwood the route diverts briefly north towards East Dean before heading south-east to Eartham. Here the path heads north-east along a section of Stane Street through Eartham Wood, before passing through the neolithic camp below Glatting Beacon and heading east down to the River Arun at Houghton. Remaining west of the river past South Stoke, it heads south through the park of Arundel Castle to the town of Arundel, where it crosses the Arun to Warningcamp. From here it continues east across the parish of Patching to Findon, passing near Cissbury Ring and climbing to meet the South Downs Way above Steyning for a short distance. Passing to the south of Steyning it crosses the River Adur at Bramber to Upper Beeding. After crossing Beeding Hill and Thundersbarrow Hill the path approaches the northern edge of the built-up area near Mile Oak, before doubling sharply back to the north of the A27 to continue east across the downs, before heading south down the former route of the Devil's Dyke railway towards West Blatchington. Crossing the built-up area south-eastwards towards Hove, it crosses Hove Park near Brighton & Hove Greyhound Stadium, before zig-zagging through the streets of Brighton to Brighton Pier. From here it runs westwards along the sea-front through Hove and Portslade, to Shoreham-by-Sea.\n\n\n\n"}

After beginning her career in 1980, she wrestled in American independent promotions before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). She had rivalries with both The Fabulous Moolah and Sherri Martel and held the WWF Women's Championship and WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. After the WWF's women's division went on hiatus in the 1990s, McIntyre wrestled in several Canadian promotions, holding several championships.\n\nMcIntyre wore wrestling boots for the first four years of her career, but later wrestled barefoot when someone took one of her boots as a joke and she was forced to wrestle without them. Wrestling barefoot subsequently became one of her trademarks, as well as her high flying wrestling maneuvers.\n\nGrowing up in Ireland, McIntyre had three brothers with whom she wrestled. After finishing high school, she moved to Oregon in 1980 to train with Sandy Barr, under whom she trained with her future opponent and tag team partner, Princess Victoria. McIntyre made her professional wrestling debut in Idaho in 1980, but she did not begin wrestling full-time until three months later. She then joined Vancouver's in 1981, where she feuded with Princess Victoria. She continued to feud with Victoria for the remainder of the year in both singles and tag team matches in Vancouver and the NWA Pacific Northwest under promoter Don Owen.\n\nIn 1982, however, she joined the World Wrestling Federation, where she began teaming with Princess Victoria, and in March, the duo lost a series of matches against the team of The Fabulous Moolah and Wendi Richter. McIntyre, however, defeated Richter in two separate matches in Bill Watts's Mid-South Wrestling Association. In November and December 1982, McIntyre worked for Stampede Wrestling, where she teamed with Judy Martin against Richter and Joyce Grable; the feud between the two teams resumed in April 1983 in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association.\n\nIn May 1983, McIntyre returned to Stampede Wrestling, where she continued her rivalry with Richter and Grable; this time, however, she teamed once again with Princess Victoria. Victoria and McIntyre won the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship on May 13 in Calgary.\n\nIn 1983, the World Wrestling Federation withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance, and when McIntyre and Victoria rejoined the promotion in 1984, they were immediately recognized as holding the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. The duo defended the championship against the team of Wendi Richter and Peggy Lee. Desiree Petersen later replaced Victoria in the team, and the new duo lost the title in August 1985 to Judy Martin and Leilani Kai (known as The Glamour Girls) in Egypt.\n\nMcIntyre then began wrestling as a singles wrestler, immediately feuding with The Fabulous Moolah, unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 (the referee counted the pin on McIntyre despite her left leg being draped over the bottom rope which should have stopped the count). She won the WWF Women's Championship on July 3, 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF's 1986 Australian tour, but Moolah regained the title six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (the only two times the WWF Women's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere). Years later, Moolah called McIntyre the best female wrestler in Canada. In 1987, McIntyre consistently lost matches to Moolah and Sherri Martel. She also competed at the Survivor Series, teaming with Moolah, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels against Martel, Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie. By 1990, however, the women's division in the WWF was again on hiatus.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, McIntyre continued to wrestle sporadically on the independent circuit. At that time, there were not many opportunities for females in the business. She competed in the Women's Pro Wrestling organization in the early 1990s. In November 1993, she won the Canadian Wrestling Alliance's Women's Championship from Iron Maiden, but lost it to Iron Maiden again in January 1994. They continued to feud into 1996, when the two women joined Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling, where the two traded the Women's Championship, which McIntyre held for two months. In September, they competed in a strap match—a match where the wrestlers must compete while connected via a leather strap—in which McIntyre was victorious.\n\nIn November 1997, as a part of the International Championship Wrestling, she won the WWWA Women's Championship from Bertha Faye. She also held the ICW Women's Championship, which she lost in July 1998.\n\nIt is a common misconception that McIntyre is the daughter of professional wrestler Stan Mykietowich.\n\nMcIntyre retired from wrestling in 1998 after discovering she was pregnant, and she later gave birth to twins. In her spare time, she makes and sells crafts.\n\n\n"}

The octogenarian writer has declared “as a man gets older, his sex instincts travel from his middle to his head.”\n\nThis Mohan Kumar as a student in the U.S., Mohan has \"lost his virginity\" at Princeton University to Jessica Brown, a beautiful black lady. Their relationship looked like a honeymoon without wedding. While still in the US, Ms Yasmeen, a Pakistani, revealed to Mohan Kumar the heady passion of a woman older than her male counterpart.\n\nAfter Mohan gets back to India and settles in married life, his passion for women continues undiminished. He feels highly relieved after being divorced by his \"nagging and ill-tempered\" wife. But Mohan was an unfaithful husband. His sex escapades, before the divorce and post divorce were unusual and varied, including his repeated relations with his ever-obliging maid, Dhanno, with her practiced charm on the bed.\n\nAnother woman in Kumar's life was Tamilian Marry Joseph, described by the author as “a dark, plump woman in her thirties.” She worked as a nurse to Kumar's son. She has been described almost inviting Shakti Kumar tacitly with these words, “Saar, one life to live, not to waste it on a drunkard husband. You agree?” Kumar has agreed.\nThe book describes Kumar's rendezvous with madam Sarojini Bhardwaj, a Professor of English. And, when it came to sex, the lady professor proved that she was stronger than many men. Another lady appearing in the sex life of Kumar was Molly Gomes, who was “not only as an incarnation of sensual impulse, but also as a mistress of sexuality.” Likewise, Susanthika, \"the small wonderful bird\", from Sri Lanka was really active on bed.\n\nThe basic theme of the book is the relationship between men and women, who has been depicted in countless works, in innumerable ways and styles, including literary texts and poetry, mediums like paintings, stone carvings, folksongs and folklores. This has been described in the book in the form of a series of events in the life of the lead character, Mohan Kumar. A series of sequences unfold in the book in the form of Mohan Kumar's association and rendezvous with a number of women.\n\nIn brief, The Company of Women celebrates the universal and the eternal story of man's relationship with woman: the relationship of love, sex, and passion. The book presents this relationship in a very unusual and original style, which is not only uninhibited and erotic, but also enormously enchanting and engrossing. However, the story also serves as a sort of modern-day morality tale, with Mohan Kumar committing suicide as he realizes he has AIDS, in effect, paying for his promiscuity.\nThis book is translated into Kannada by Ravi Belagere\n"}

Delfino,\" 35 Cal.4th 180 (2005) is a California Supreme Court opinion by then-Associate Justice Janice R. Brown interpreting the state's SLAPP statute. Specifically, the case holds that an appeal from a denial of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all trial court proceedings: \"The perfecting of an appeal from the denial of a special motion to strike automatically stays all further trial court proceedings on the merits upon the causes of action affected by the motion...you have a right not to be dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights.\"\n\nIn this case involving the arcana of appellate procedure, research scientists Michelangelo Delfino, Ph.D. and Mary E. Day filed an appeal from a $775,000 defamation judgment for tens of thousands of postings they made on their Website and on various Internet message boards criticizing their former employer, Varian Associates, renamed Varian Medical Systems in April 1999; two senior Varian Associates' executives, George A. Zdasiuk and Susan B. Felch; and a 1999 Varian Associates' spin off, Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, a high-tech corporation headquartered in Gloucester, Massachusetts. The judgment against Delfino and Day included a broad injunction ordering them not to \"publish, post, or otherwise disseminate, directly or indirectly, on the Internet or elsewhere\" 23 categories of statements that the trial court judge Jack Komar, and not the jury, found \"untrue\" and \"false and defamatory.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2001 prior to the Santa Clara County Superior Court trial, Delfino and Day filed a special motion to strike Varian's complaint under California's Anti-SLAPP statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The trial court denied the motion and Delfino and Day appealed from that denial, but the trial court and California Courts of Appeal refused to stay the trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 916 while the anti-SLAPP appeal was pending. At the conclusion of a seven-week jury trial the anti-SLAPP appeal was dismissed as moot.\n\nOn appeal to the California Sixth District Court of Appeal, in November 2003 a three-judge panel rejected the argument that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to conduct the trial because of Delfino and Days' pending appeal from the denial of their anti-SLAPP motion. On March 3, 2004, the California Supreme Court granted review to resolve the jurisdictional question: Does an appeal from the denial of a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute effect an automatic stay of the trial court proceedings? Three weeks after review was granted the Supreme Court stayed all of the plaintiffs' attempts to collect on the judgment and no compensation were ever collected from Delfino and Day.\n\nOn March 3, 2005, the Supreme Court held by a 7-0 vote that under Code of Civil Procedure section 916, \"all of the matters on trial were embraced in and affected by defendants' appeal from the denial of that motion and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over those matters.\" By a 6-1 vote, Chief Justice Ronald M. George dissenting, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, finding that the lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the trial court rendered the resulting trial completely void. The Supreme Court found that Delfino and Day's postings were simply \"derogatory\" and remanded the case back to the Santa Clara County Superior Court for a new trial where Komar was quickly disqualified as trial judge and replaced by the Honorable Jamie A. Jacobs-May. On the eve of a second jury trial, in March 2006 with Jacobs-May presiding and with Delfino and Day in pro per, the case settled amicably and more than seven years of remarkably acrimonious litigation ended.\n\nAmicus curiae briefs in support of Delfino and Day were filed in the Supreme Court by the California Attorney General, the California Newspaper Publishers Association with the Los Angeles Times, Oakland Tribune and San Francisco Chronicle, and the ACLU. All four Varian plaintiffs represented by the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm and the Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP failed to receive any amicus support.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863423", "title": "Bayesian game", "text": "Bayesian game\n\nIn game theory, a Bayesian game is a game in which players have incomplete information about the other players. For example, a player may not know the exact payoff functions of the other players, but instead have beliefs about these payoff functions. These beliefs are represented by a probability distribution over the possible payoff functions. \n\nJohn C. Harsanyi describes a Bayesian game in the following way. Each player in the game is associated with a set of types, with each type in the set corresponding to a possible payoff function for that player. In addition to the actual players in the game, there is a special player called Nature. Nature randomly \"chooses\" a type for each player according to a probability distribution across the players' type spaces. This probability distribution is known by all players (the \"common prior assumption\"). This modeling approach transforms games of incomplete information into games of imperfect information (in which the history of play within the game is not known to all players). \n\nIncompleteness of information means that at least one player is unsure of the type (and therefore the payoff function) of another player. Such games are called \"Bayesian\" because players are typically assumed to update their beliefs according to Bayes' rule. In particular, the belief a player holds about another player's type might change according to his own type. \n\nIn a Bayesian game, one has to specify type spaces, strategy spaces, payoff functions and prior beliefs. A strategy for a player is a complete plan of action that covers every contingency that might arise for every type that player might be. A type space for a player is just the set of all possible \"types\" of that player. The beliefs of a player describe the uncertainty of that player about the types of the other players. Each belief is the probability of the other players having particular types, given the type of the player with that belief. A payoff function is a function of strategy profiles and types.\n\nFormally, such a game is given by:\nformula_1, where\n\n\nA pure strategy for player formula_5 is a function formula_16. A mixed strategy for player formula_5 is a function formula_18, where formula_19 is the set of all probability distributions on formula_4. Note that a strategy for any given player only depends on his own type. \n\nA strategy profile formula_21 is a strategy for each player. A strategy profile determines expected payoffs for each player, where the expectation is taken over both the set of states of nature (and hence profiles of types) with respect to beliefs formula_13, and the randomization over actions implied by any mixed strategies in the profile formula_21.\n\nIn a non-Bayesian game, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if every strategy in that profile is a best response to every other strategy in the profile; i.e., there is no strategy that a player could play that would yield a higher payoff, given all the strategies played by the other players. \n\nAn analogous concept can be defined for a Bayesian game, the difference being that every player's strategy maximizes his expected payoff given his beliefs about the state of nature. A player's beliefs about the state of nature are formed by conditioning the prior probabilities formula_13 on his own type according to Bayes' rule.\n\nA \"Bayesian Nash equilibrium\" is defined as a strategy profile that maximizes the expected payoff for each player given their beliefs and given the strategies played by the other players. That is, a strategy profile formula_21 is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium if and only if for every player formula_26 keeping the strategies of every other player fixed, strategy formula_27 maximizes the expected payoff of player formula_5 according to his beliefs.\n\nBayesian Nash equilibrium can result in implausible equilibria in dynamic games, where players move sequentially rather than simultaneously. As in games of complete information, these can arise via non-credible strategies off the equilibrium path. In games of incomplete information there is also the additional possibility of non-credible beliefs.\n\nTo deal with these issues, Perfect Bayesian equilibrium, in the spirit of subgame perfect equilibrium requires that, starting from any information set, subsequent play be optimal. Furthermore, it requires that beliefs be updated consistently with Bayes' rule on every path of play that occurs with positive probability.\n\nThe definition of Bayesian games has been combined with stochastic games to allow for environment states (e.g. physical world states) and stochastic transitions between states. The resulting \"stochastic Bayesian game\" model is solved via a recursive combination of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the Bellman optimality equation.\n\nThe definition of Bayesian games and Bayesian equilibrium has been extended to deal with collective agency. One approach is to continue to treat individual players as reasoning in isolation, but to allow them, with some probability, to reason from the perspective of a collective. Another approach is to assume that players within any collective agent know that the agent exists, but that other players do not know this, although they suspect it with some probability. For example, Alice and Bob may sometimes optimize as individuals and sometimes collude as a team, depending on the state of nature, but other players may not know which of these is the case.\n\nA sheriff faces an armed suspect. Both must simultaneously decide whether to shoot the other or not.\n\nThe suspect can either be of type \"criminal\" or type \"civilian\". The sheriff has only one type. The suspect knows its type and the Sheriff's type, but the Sheriff does not know the suspect's type. Thus, there is incomplete information (because the suspect has private information), making it a Bayesian game. There is a probability \"p\" that the suspect is a criminal, and a probability \"1-p\" that the suspect is a civilian; both players are aware of this probability (common prior assumption, which can be converted into a complete-information game with imperfect information).\n\nThe sheriff would rather defend himself and shoot if the suspect shoots, or not shoot if the suspect does not (even if the suspect is a criminal). The suspect would rather shoot if he is a criminal, even if the sheriff does not shoot, but would rather not shoot if he is a civilian, even if the sheriff shoots. Thus, the payoff matrix of this Normal-form game for both players depends on the type of the suspect. It is assumed that payoffs are given as follows:\nIf both players are rational and both know that both players are rational and everything that is known by any player is known to be known by every player (i.e. player 1 knows player 2 knows that player 1 is rational and player 2 knows this, etc. \"ad infinitum\" – common knowledge), play in the game will be as follows according to perfect Bayesian equilibrium:\n\nWhen the type is \"civilian\", the dominant strategy for the suspect is not to shoot, and when the type is \"criminal\", the dominant strategy for the suspect is to shoot; alternative strictly dominated strategy can thus be removed. Given this, if the sheriff shoots, he will have a payoff of 0 with probability p and a payoff of -1 with probability 1-p, i.e. an expected payoff of p-1; if the sheriff does not shoot, he will have a payoff of -2 with probability p and a payoff of 0 with probability 1-p, i.e. an expected payoff of -2p. Thus, the Sheriff will always shoot if p-1 > -2p, i.e. when p > 1/3.\n\n\n"}

The Krewe of Orpheus was founded by Harry Connick Jr., his father Harry Connick Sr., Sonny Borey, and others. When the krewe had their first parade on February 14, 1994, there was a record high 700 riders on their parade, and they had then already established themselves as a super krewe.\n\nThe Krewe of Orpheus derives its name from the mortal Orpheus, son of the god Apollo and the muse Calliope. The story of Orpheus illustrates the power of music in both this world and the next. Legend is that Apollo presented Orpheus with a lyre, which he played with perfection. The music of Orpheus was so beautiful that wild animals ceased their hunting, mountains bowed, seas stopped spraying and trees bent near to listen when he sang. His music was celebrated and cherished by all who heard it. His melodies inspired the noblest love. When Orpheus sang every heart was opened.\n\nOrpheus accompanied Jason and the Argonauts on their adventures. During one voyage a storm arose, and Orpheus began to play his lyre. Immediately, the sea calmed and the storm ended. When his fellow sailors were bewitched by the enchanted song of the Sirens, Orpheus took up his lyre and began to sing. The Sirens' song lost all its power, and the women were changed into rocks. However, Orpheus' greatest feat involved his beautiful wife, Eurydice.\n\nShortly after their marriage, Eurydice was pursued by Aristaeus, who was overwhelmed by her beauty. When fleeing his advances, Eurydice stepped on a snake, which bit her foot, and she died. Overcome with grief, Orpheus vowed to rescue her from the regions of the dead.\n\nOrpheus gained entry to the Underworld by using his music to charm Charon, the ferryman and Cerberus, the three headed dog that guarded the gates of Hell. He passed through crowds of ghosts, and presented himself before Hades and Persephone. Orpheus strummed his lyre as he implored them to return Eurydice to the realm of the living. As he sang, the ghosts wept and the cheeks of the Furies became wet with tears. The yearning notes from Orpheus' lyre had kindled their memories of the sweet secrets of life's pleasures. At last, Eurydice was called forth. Orpheus was permitted to take her away, on condition that he should not turn to look at her until they both reached the surface.\n\nThey traveled through dark waters and passages, in silence. They had nearly reached the surface and shafts of sunlight began to illuminate the cavern. In a moment of longing, Orpheus cast a glance behind him. But Eurydice was still in darkness, and she was instantly carried away. They reached for one another, but only grasped the air. Eurydice was lost to Orpheus forever.\n\nTouched by the charm and power of the music of Orpheus, Zeus turned his lyre into a constellation. Thus, Orpheus still inspires lovers, at night, as they gaze upon his stars.\n\nThe Krewe accepts members of either gender and any race or ethnicity, and quickly became one of New Orleans' largest, after it was founded in 1993. Ridership is open to dues paid members. Krewe of Orpheus was the first super krewe to include both men and women.\n\nThe Krewe of Orpheus parades on St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street on Lundi Gras (Fat Monday) - the day before Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday). The parade ends inside the Convention Center where Orpheuscapade begins.\n\nKrewe of Orpheus utilize flambeaux to light the parade route.\n\nPer 2008, the krewe has 36 floats.\nHarry Connick, Jr. wrote and recorded a song for his 1994 album \"She\", called \"Here Comes the Big Parade\". The song's music video shows clips from floats in the parade. The floats have a large amount of flowers, gilding and gold leaf. The flowers are made out of cardboard, wire, paint, gold leafing, some of paper-mâché, etc.\n\n\nTrinkets, collectables, masks, and beads tossed by hand from riders of the floats are called throws. Collectible throws from Orpheus include the Orpheus emblem beads, stuffed animals, signature beads, light-up Orpheus medallion beads, custom print go-cups, three different types of doubloons, masks, and 4-foot-long stuffed dragons.\n\nThe Orpheus parade ends inside the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center where Orpheuscapade begins. Orpheuscapade is a post-parade black-tie party that includes live music, food, and dancing. It is open to the public by paid admission. It is estimated Orpheuscapade draws a crowd of over 5000 people each year.\n\n\n"}

These routes are often unsurfaced, typically having the appearance of 'green lanes'. Despite this, it is legal (but may not be physically possible) to drive any type of vehicle along certain byways, the same as any ordinary tarmac road. \n\nIn 2000 the legal term 'restricted byway' was introduced to cover rights of way along which it is legal to travel by any mode (including on foot, bicycle, horse-drawn carriage etc.) but excluding 'mechanically propelled vehicles'.\n\nIn England & Wales, a byway open to all traffic (BOAT) is a highway over which the public have a right of way for vehicular and all other kinds of traffic but which is used by the public mainly for the purposes for which footpaths and bridleways are used (i.e. walking, cycling or horse riding (United Kingdom Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, section 15(9)(c), as amended by Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Act 1991, Schedule 1).

The latter can often be seen to bend and change width at the parish boundary: this reflects the work of the different surveyors who had each built a road from a village to its boundary. If the roads did not meet up exactly, which was quite common, a sharp double bend would result.\n\nMany British byways are sinuous, as the poet G. K.

The recordings reflect the wide variety of music that could be heard in Memphis at the time: blues, rhythm & blues, gospel, country & western, hillbilly, rockabilly and bluegrass. Because of the recordings' historical significance in the foundation of rock and roll music, they were inducted into the U.S. Congress's National Recording Registry in 2002.\n\nOf the 24 known taped songs, 22 survive. Ten were released by Sun as Elvis's first five singles between 1954 and 1955. With the exception of the first four songs, which were demos recorded at Presley's expense, all of the songs were produced by Sam Phillips and featured Scotty Moore on guitar and Bill Black on bass.\n\nA year after Presley joined RCA Victor, he had a spontaneous informal session with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis when visiting the Sun studio. This meeting was recorded on December 4, 1956, and dubbed the Million Dollar Quartet by the local newspaper the next day. These sessions are not generally included when reference is made to \"Elvis's Sun Sessions\", however.\n\nOn July 18, 1953, Presley first went to the Memphis Recording Service at the Sun Record Company, now commonly known as Sun Studio. He paid $3.98 to record the first of two double-sided demo acetates, \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\". Presley reportedly gave the acetate to his mother as a much-belated extra birthday present, although many biographers suggest that Presley simply wanted to get noticed by Sun owner Sam Phillips. These suggestions are strengthened by the fact that the Presleys did not own a record player at the time.\nThat one-off acetate has since been valued at $500,000 by \"Record Collector\" magazine. Returning to Sun Studios on January 4, 1954, he recorded a second acetate, \"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" / \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\".\n\nPhillips had already cut the first records by blues artists such as Howlin' Wolf and Junior Parker. He thought a combination of black blues and boogie-woogie music would be very popular among white people, if presented in the right way. In the spring, Presley auditioned for an amateur gospel quartet called The Songfellows, as one of the group was leaving and they were seeking a replacement. However, following Presley's audition, the original group member decided to stay. In May, Presley auditioned at the Hi-Hat in Memphis as a vocalist for a band. Eddie Bond, the owner of the Hi-Hat, turned him down.\n\nWhen Phillips acquired a demo recording of \"Without You\" and was unable to identify the vocalist, his assistant, Marion Keisker, reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him on May 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (the original acetate of the song that Phillips presented to Elvis resides in the Memphis State University collection), but Phillips asked him to perform some of the many other songs he knew. After running through a few songs, Presley expressed an interest in finding a band to play with, and Phillips invited local Western swing musicians Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore (electric guitar) and Bill Black (slap bass) to audition Presley. They did so on Sunday, July 4, 1954, at Moore's house. Neither musician was overly impressed, but they agreed a studio session would be useful to explore his potential.\n\nOn July 5, 1954, the trio met at Sun studios to rehearse and record a handful of songs. According to Moore, the first song they recorded was \"I Love You Because\", but, after a few other country-oriented songs that weren't all that impressive, they decided to take a break. During the break, Presley began \"acting the fool\" with Arthur Crudup's \"That's All Right (Mama)\", a blues song. When the other two musicians joined in, Phillips got them to restart and began taping. This was the bright, upbeat sound he had been looking for. Black remarked, \"Damn. Get that on the radio and they'll run us out of town.\" The group recorded four songs during that session, including bluegrass musician Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", which he had written and recorded as a slow waltz. Sources credit Bill Black with initiating the song, with Presley and Moore joining in. They ended up with a fast version of the song in 4/4 time. After an early take, Phillips can be heard on tape saying: \"Fine, man. Hell, that's different—that's a pop song now, nearly 'bout.\"\n\nTo gauge professional and public reaction, Phillips took several acetates of the session to DJ Dewey Phillips (no relation) of Memphis radio station WHBQ's \"Red, Hot and Blue\" show. \"That's All Right\" subsequently received its first play on July 8, 1954. A week later, Sun had received some 6,000 advanced orders for \"That's All Right\" / \"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\" which was released on July 19, 1954. From August 18 through December 8, \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" was consistently higher on the charts, and then both sides began to chart across the South.\n\nAfter several performances with other bands, Presley arranged for Moore and Black to be his regular back-up group, giving them each 25% of the takings. Moore and Black were originally members of their own band, The Starlight Wranglers, but after the success of \"That's All Right\", jealousy within the group forced them to split.\n\nOver the next 15 months, the trio would release five singles, tour extensively across the South, and appear regularly on the Louisiana Hayride; it was the biggest rival to the Grand Ole Opry at the time. They had originally auditioned for the Opry in October 1954, but they failed to impress the people in charge, or the audience, and were not invited back. Several biographers cite Jim Denny, talent agent at the Opry, as the man who told Presley that he should \"go back to driving a truck\".\n\nThe trio would record at Sun together until November 1955, when Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA Victor for $40,000; it was, at the time, the highest sum ever paid for a recording contract. Sun had permission to keep pressing the singles until January 1, 1956, and RCA Victor released Presley's first five Sun singles nationally. In January 1956, Presley recorded \"Heartbreak Hotel\", his first RCA Victor single. He would return to Sun studios regularly over the next few months, visiting with Phillips and meeting many of the label's new artists.\n\nAlthough Presley never officially recorded for Sun again, he was caught on tape during an impromptu jamming session on December 4, 1956. Presley had arrived during a Carl Perkins recording session, which also featured a young Jerry Lee Lewis on piano, and a new artist named Johnny Cash watching on. During a break in recording, Presley sat at the piano and began to sing along with Perkins, Lewis and Cash. Phillips kept his tape recorder running, and, seeing an opportunity to promote another of his new acts, he arranged for a reporter to cover the event. The recordings would eventually be known as \"The Million Dollar Quartet\".\n\nDuring Presley's tenure at Sun Records, he recorded two demo recordings in Lubbock, Texas: \"Fool, Fool, Fool\" and \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", which were released for the first time by RCA in the 1990s. These are not considered Sun recordings.\n\nListed are the 24 titles from 1953–55, ordered by their recording date. A take is any later version; the best take would be used to create a master to be issued.\n\nMy Happiness was recorded as a self-financed demo. \n\nThe original is by Borney Bergantine (the melody existed in 1933), and Betty Peterson Blasco; published in 1948.\n\nThat's When Your Heartaches Begin was recorded as a self-financed demo. \nThe original is from 1937 by William Raskin, Fred Fisher and George Brown, and recorded by The Ink Spots in 1941.\n\nI'll Never Stand in Your Way, by Hy Heath, is another self-financed recording.\n\nIt Wouldn't Be the Same Without You is the fourth and final self-financed demo Elvis recorded. The song is by Fred Rose.\n\nI Love You Because is a song by Leon Payne, original probably 1949, Capitol; Eddie Fisher (1950, RCA Victor)\n\nThat's All Right (Mama) was written and recorded by Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup (1947, RCA Victor). Crudup's original title is \"That's All Right (Mama)\"; on the Sun label, and many later releases, '(Mama)' is omitted: \"That's All Right\".\n\nElvis's recording of \"That's All Right (Mama)\" is mentioned as one of the beginning of rock and roll, though the first rock and roll records predate it.\n\nHugh Williams - Jimmy Kennedy. Original: possibly Harry Owens and His Royal Hawaiians.\n\nThe 4-CD boxed set \"Today, Tomorrow and Forever\" contains an alternate version (take three).\n\nBlue Moon of Kentucky is a bluegrass song by Bill Monroe, originally recorded by \"Bill Monroe and His Bluegrass Boys\" (1947, Columbia).\n\nThe 1992 album \"\" contains a fragment (1:03) of an alternate take in a slower, more country style. This take was originally released on bootleg in 1974, having been located at Sun Records many years after Presley left for RCA.\n\nR. Rodgers - L. Hart.\nOriginal: Ted Fio Rito & His Orchestra (Brunswick LA231=C 11/19/1934) \nAlso: Connie Boswell (Brunswick 16642, 1/15/1935) \n\nSam Coslow - Will Grosz. Original: Lonnie Johnson (1948, King)\n\nJimmy Wakely. Original: Jimmy Wakely (1943, Decca)\n\nM. David. Original probably Patti Page (1950, Mercury)\n\nThe Dean Martin version was probably Elvis' inspiration.\n\nSydney Robin - Bob Shelton - Joe Shelton. Original: The Shelton Brothers (1942, Decca)\nRecorded 1933\n\nAlso; Lonestar Cowboys, 1933 on RCA (Victor), Nelstone's Hawaiians: Victor V40273 (1929).\nThe song was also recorded by Frank Yankovic and was responsible for his band being rated the #13 band \"on the Nation's Juke Boxes\" in 1948. \n\nRoy Brown. Original Roy Brown (1947, DeLuxe); also Wynonie \"Mr. Blues\" Harris (1948, King)\n\nKokomo Arnold. Original probably Kokomo Arnold (1935, Decca)\nOther releases: Johnny Lee Wills (1941, Decca); Moon Mullican (1946, King); Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys as \"Brain Cloudy Blues\", (1946, Columbia)\n\nJack Sallee\n\nArthur Gunter. Original: Arthur Gunter (1954, Excello)\n\nIn 1951 Eddy Arnold recorded a song titled “I Want to Play House with You” \n\nRay Charles\n\nRose Marie McCoy - Charles Singleton. Original: The Eagles (1954, Mercury)\n\nIn 2002, RCA included information in the liner notes of \"Sunrise\" as to Presley recording this song while simultaneously playing the piano, and not aided by his rhythm guitar, as previously believed. Because the piano was not directly miked, it can only be heard faintly in the background.\n\nStan Kesler - William Taylor\n\nStan Kesler - Charlie Feathers\n\nJunior Parker - Sam Phillips. Original: Little Junior's Blue Flames (1953, Sun)\n\nWilliam R. Emerson. Original: Billy Emerson (1955, Sun)\n\nOn December 4, 1956, a year after Elvis had left Sun for RCA, he revisited Sun Studio. The afternoon became a jam session with Carl Perkins (then already famous for his \"Blue Suede Shoes\"), Jerry Lee Lewis (relatively unknown at the time), and Johnny Cash (not heard on the tapes, although he does appear on the cover photo). The taping was largely unintended by the quartet; they were just singing the songs they had in mind. About 40 titles are recorded, most of them incomplete. Elvis is caught telling about a singer he saw in Las Vegas, doing his version of \"Don't Be Cruel\", and they're enjoying \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\" from Chuck Berry.\n\nOver the decades, several additional recordings have been claimed as having been recorded by Elvis at Sun Records. The reference work \"Elvis: The Illustrated Record\" by Roy Carr and Mick Farren lists the following songs that were, as of 1982, believed to have been recorded by Elvis at Sun Records but as of 2009 remain unreleased and unaccounted for in the official record:\n\nMost of the tapes, including the private single, the Million Dollar Quartet and alternate takes have been released.\n\nTen songs, making five singles, were originally released on the Sun label. These records (in both 45 RPM and 78 RPM formats) are among the most valuable of Elvis's output, fetching four figures in excellent condition:\n\nAfter signing with RCA, the same songs, in the same b/w combination, were re-released by RCA (December 1955). The songs were available on 78 RPM and 45 RPM, which explains the two ordering-numbers 20/47, respectively:\n\nThe same pairings were later reissued as part of RCA's Gold Standard series in five different label formats: Black label with dog at top (September 1958), black label with dog on left side (September 1965), orange label (November 1968), red label (September 1970), and black label with dog in upper right hand corner (September 1976)\n\nOn January 27, 1956, the first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\" b/w \"I Was the One\" was released, giving Elvis a nationwide breakthrough. His reputation as a performer on stage was already growing in the same dimensions.\n\nOn March 23, 1956, the first album, \"Elvis Presley\", was released (RCA 1254). At that moment, \"Heartbreak Hotel\" was climbing the lists, but as Rock'n'Roll was largely bought by teenagers at the time, and teenagers usually bought singles, albums were seen as less important for the genre; as such, \"Heartbreak Hotel\" is not on this album. RCA, however, put five unreleased Sun recordings on this album:\n\nThese two albums were released during Elvis's hitch in the Army, consisting of tracks previously released only as singles or on EPs, including all but one of the ten commercially released Sun tracks. Four were included on \"For LP Fans Only\"...\n\n...with five featured on \"A Date with Elvis\":\n\nThe remaining commercial release, \"I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine\", would not appear on LP until the 1976 compilation \"The Sun Sessions\".\n\n\nOn March 22, 1976, the album \"The Sun Sessions\" was released, with 16 out of the 24 known Sun titles:\nMissing:\n\nAlthough the title suggests more, only 18 out of the 24 known Sun songs are here. The album does contain several takes from \"I Love You Because\", and \"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\".\nMissing:\n\nThe recordings have been released in 1989 as a CD, titled, \"Elvis Presley - The Million Dollar Quartet\" (RCA CD # 2023-2-R)\n\nNearly every song Elvis recorded at Sun is present here (although \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\" is hidden on CD number 5; the rest is on CD 1). \nMissing:\n\nAnother delving in the Sun Records vaults is the most complete collection of Elvis's recordings from that time. All the masters, some demos and alternate recordings, and a few early live-recorded tracks.\nMissing:\n\nThe current (as of mid-2006) version of the Sun recordings. Contains the five singles (\"That's All Right\" / \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\"; \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" / \"I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine\"; \"Milkcow Blues Boogie\" / \"You're a Heartbreaker\"; \"Baby Let's Play House\" / \"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\"; \"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\" / \"Mystery Train\") plus \"Harbor Lights\", \"I Love You Because\" (alternate take 2), \"Tomorrow Night\", \"I'll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin')\", \"Just Because\", \"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\" (slow version), \"Tryin' to Get to You\", and \"When It Rains, It Really Pours\".\n\nMissing:\n\nA limited-edition 3-CD box set released in June 2012 by RCA/Sony collectors' label Follow That Dream (FTD) Records, as a companion piece to a book by Ernst Mikael Jørgensen, also entitled \"A Boy from Tupelo\". The book chronicles Presley's day-to-day life from July 4, 1954 (the day when he first rehearsed with guitarist Scotty Moore) to December 31, 1955, including many previously unpublished testimonies, accounts and details on every single show performed by Presley during the period (the book is, indeed, mainly intended as a complete concertography and tourography of Elvis Presley's early career). The first two of the three discs released in conjunction with the book feature, as the title specifies, all the material recorded by Presley from 1953 to 1955, including all of the alternate takes and all of the recordings which were missing from previous releases, with the exception of \"Satisfied\" and \"I Got a Woman\"; the latter two recordings are stated by Jørgensen himself, in the book, to be actually lost. However, a live rendition from March 19, 1955 of \"I Got a Woman\" is featured on the third disc of the package, along with 31 more live recordings from the era, 27 of which are previously unreleased. The \"A Boy from Tupelo\" book + CDs package, which was printed as a strictly limited run of 3,000 copies (each including a gift pack consisting in five 45-RPM reproductions of Presley's original Sun singles) is, as of September 2012, sold out and not scheduled to be reprinted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863453", "title": "California State Route 17", "text": "California State Route 17\n\nState Route 17 (SR 17) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs from State Route 1 in Santa Cruz to Interstates 280 and 880 in San Jose. SR 17, a freeway and expressway, carries substantial commuter and vacation traffic between Santa Cruz and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFrom its southern terminus with SR 1 in Santa Cruz, Route 17 begins as a five-lane freeway (narrows to four lanes after Pasatiempo Drive). From there, it proceeds through Scotts Valley. At the north end of Scotts Valley, it becomes a four-lane divided highway, with access at various points without interchanges, and begins a winding ascent of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The road crosses the Santa Clara/Santa Cruz county line through the Patchen Pass, commonly referred to as \"The Summit\", at an elevation of 1,800 feet (549 m), where there is an interchange with SR 35. Just north of the summit, a winding descent of the mountains begins, again with access at various points, mostly without grade separations, as far as Los Gatos. At Los Gatos, SR 17 becomes a freeway again. It expands to six lanes after an interchange with SR 85. This interchange has three levels; in a similar fashion to SR 99 at U.S. 50 in Sacramento, SR 17 is at-grade, with the other levels below-grade. The number of lanes later expands to eight shortly before reaching its northern terminus at Interstate 280, where it continues as Interstate 880.\n\nSR 17 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 17 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.\n\nSR 17's combination of narrow shoulders, dense traffic, sharp turns, blind curves, wandering fauna such as deer and mountain lions, and sudden changes in traffic speeds have led to driving conditions that result in a number of collisions and fatalities, leading to the reputation of SR 17 as one of the most dangerous highways in the state. In the winter months, because SR 17 crosses a high precipitation area in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the roadway can become slippery from rain, snow or ice, especially at the summit.\n\nDespite having fewer curves than in Santa Cruz County, certain sections of SR 17 in Santa Clara County are so dangerous that they have been nicknamed. The first long sweeping turn North of Summit Road with its sharp angle and steep entering downhill slope is called \"The Valley Surprise\" for the fact that so many strike the median shortly after having entered the Santa Clara Valley. The most infamous is called \"Big Moody Curve\". This curve is named after Big Moody Creek below, slightly greater than a 180 degree turn, and bracketed by additional 90 degree turns. The inside surfaces of the median barriers in both of these turns are normally chipped up and black with tire rubber.\n\nEfforts to improve safety have included adding electronic speed monitoring signs and warnings lights on curves, removing trees to improve visibility around blind curves, and increased patrol and enforcement of traffic laws. The portion between Los Gatos and Scotts Valley has been designated the Highway 17 Safety Corridor by Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol. In addition, barbed wired fencing and retaining walls were added after the route suffered landslides in the Loma Prieta Earthquake. The route has seen recent repaving work in 2010, 2014, and 2019-2020.\n\nGillian Cichowski Memorial Overcrossing Bridge, over SR 17 near Los Gatos at Lexington Reservoir, was named by California Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, Chapt. 70 in 1994. Gillian Cichowski was killed in an accident at this location in 1992. This is one of the few highway constructions in California named for a woman. The overpass was in response to a campaign by friends of Gillian Cichowski to make the intersection (with Bear Creek Road) safer. The overpass was open to northbound traffic July 18, 1996 and opened to southbound traffic August 29, 1996. Margaret Green of Sunnyvale, California died in a similar accident near the same location during overpass construction.\nSR 17 in Santa Cruz County is named after California Highway Patrol Lieutenant Michael Walker. Walker was setting flares to direct traffic around an auto accident on New Year's Eve 2005 when he was struck and killed. Partly in response to this accident near the Glenwood Road intersection, Caltrans began work in 2008 to widen the shoulder to eight feet.\n\nIn 1934, the State of California began signing its routes. The route which in subsequent years corresponded with State Route 17 was signed as State Route 13, and described as \"Santa Cruz to Jct. US 101 at San Rafael, via San Jose, Mt. Eden, and Oakland.\" The route taken between Oakland and San Rafael is not described.\n\nIn the 1920s, the segment from San Jose northward had been signed as US 101-E (\"east\"), branching off from US 101-W in San Jose.\n\nThe earliest connection between Santa Cruz and San Jose was an old Native American foot trail. The first road that could be navigated by a wagon was a dirt toll road built by Charlie McKiernan, known as \"Mountain Charlie\" by locals, some time around 1853. Portions of this road still exist as Mountain Charlie Road, to the west of Highway 17 and south of Summit Road. Several other stage lines were built as competitors, such as the San Jose Turnpike (1863), which follows the approximate route of present-day Soquel San Jose Road. After realignment to increase the road width; many sections of the original stage route were cut off. These sections became side streets named with variations containing Old Turnpike. Some of these now dead end streets have retained the look of narrow stage coach roads.\n\nSR 17 was opened in 1940, replacing several other modes of transportation, including the old Glenwood Highway from 1919 (which still exists in Glenwood), and the railroad which went all the way from Santa Cruz to San Francisco and Oakland. The railroad stopped operating in 1940 and the tunnels that it passed through were sealed soon after. Nearly all the tunnel entrances still exist, but are unusable as the tunnels themselves are collapsed. The rise in the use of automobiles made the railroads unprofitable. The city of Glenwood, founded by Charles C. Martin in 1851, gained notoriety for hot springs in the area. The Glenwood Highway, which passed through town, was deserted when the \"New 17\" was built, and the town became a ghost of its former self. The town has but one resident left, Mrs. Ed C. Koch, who is the great-granddaughter of the founder.\n\nParts of the original SR 17 lie underwater in Lexington Reservoir. When the reservoir was built, the highway was rerouted to higher ground, and the two towns along its path (Alma and Lexington) were abandoned. When the reservoir levels are extremely low, the old highway pavement is visible as well as some stone and concrete foundations of buildings.\n\nSR 17 first appeared along the east shore of San Francisco Bay in the mid-1930s. The original route between San Jose and Oakland ran along the Old Oakland Road, Main Street (Milpitas) and Warm Springs Boulevard (southern Fremont) proceeding along what is now Fremont Boulevard, which becomes Alvarado Boulevard in Northern Fremont, before entering Union City. From there, the route proceeded along Hesperian Boulevard in Hayward, then into San Leandro via East 14th Street to Davis. It then went west on Davis to Maitland Drive along the southern edge of the Oakland Municipal Airport and across Bay Farm Island to the Bay Farm Island Bridge into Alameda. In Alameda it went via Clay, High, Santa Clara, and Webster to the Posey Tube. SR 17 went through the Posey Tube into Oakland along Harrison Street to 14th, and west on 14th to Broadway where it terminated at a junction with US 40 and SR 24.\n\nFollowing the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in late 1936, SR 17 was re-routed. Instead of turning west at Davis Street in San Leandro, it was continued along East 14th Street into Oakland. At 44th Avenue it turned west, leading to a new diagonal connection to East 12th Street. SR 17 then followed East 12th northward to 14th Avenue, then one block on 14th to East 8th Street, becoming 8th Street into downtown Oakland. It continued west on 8th, picking up a concurrency with Business Route US 50 at Broadway. Both routes continued on 8th to Cypress Street which became an elevated viaduct entering the Bay Bridge Distribution Structure (\"The Maze\"). SR 17 terminated here at its junction with US 40 (Eastshore Highway) and US 50 (38th Street).\n\nIn 1947, work began on a new freeway through Oakland to replace the street routing of SR 17. It was finished in segments, finishing in 1958 with the completion of the double-decked Cypress Structure leading into the MacArthur Maze. The new freeway was called the \"Eastshore Freeway\", continuous with a planned new freeway north of the Maze to replace the old Eastshore Highway. In 1958, the freeway south of the Maze was re-named the \"Nimitz Freeway\", in honor of WWII Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.\n\nWith the completion of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge in 1956, as well as the first segment of the Eastshore Freeway north of the Maze, SR 17 was extended northward along the new freeway in a concurrency with US 40. SR 17 left the freeway at the Hoffman Blvd. exit (thereafter popularly called the \"Hoffman Split\") and proceeded along city streets through Richmond to the San Rafael bridge. It went via Hoffman, Cutting, and Standard Avenue up to the bridge. It crossed the bridge into San Rafael, terminating at a junction with US 101.\n\nIn 1984 the segment of SR 17 from Interstate 280 in San Jose to the Maze (by then known as the \"MacArthur Maze\") in Oakland was renumbered as I-880, and the portion of SR 17 from the MacArthur Maze to San Rafael was renumbered as part of I-580. SR 17 was thereby reduced to its current length.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863469", "title": "Corbeil Bus Corporation", "text": "Corbeil Bus Corporation\n\nCorbeil is a defunct trade name that has been used in bus manufacturing. From 1936 to 1975, J.H. Corbeil was a manufacturer of bus bodies; Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil was a body manufacturer that specialized primarily in school buses, opened from 1985 to 2007. In 2007, the company was acquired out of bankruptcy by Collins Industries and renamed Corbeil Bus Corporation. Serving as the Canadian equivalent of Collins Bus Corporation, manufacturing was shifted from Quebec to Hutchinson, Kansas. \n\nPrior to its 2007 shift to Kansas, Corbeil manufacturing was located in Saint-Lin–Laurentides, Quebec, Canada. \n\nFollowing the 2013 discontinuation of manufacturer Mid Bus, Collins ended the use of the Corbeil name after 2015 in favor of using its namesake brand on its vehicles across North America. \n\nCorbeil traces its roots to 1936, when Joseph Henri Corbeil founded J.H. Corbeil. Located in St-Lin-Laurentides, the company was a manufacturer of bodies for trucks and buses, shifting to bus body production in 1956. Following the 1960 death of Joseph Corbeil, control of J.H. Corbeil shifted to his sons, including Michel Corbeil. During the late 1960s, the company held nearly two-thirds market share of bus body production in Quebec and eastern Canadian provinces.\n\nTo accommodate increased demand, J.H. Corbeil introduced a larger manufacturing facility in St-Lin-Laurentides (next door to the first factory). After the 1975 sale of J.H. Corbeil, the company ended operations in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1985, with several business partners in St-Lin-Laurentides, Michel Corbeil founded Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil, Inc. restarting production in the 7,000 square-foot factory founded by his father in 1936. For the first time, Corbeil produced school bus bodies, specializing in bodies for single rear-wheel cutaway van chassis. By the end of 1985, the company produced 77 bus bodies. \n\nBy the end of the 1980s, production of Corbeil buses expanded, with the company replacing its 1930s facility with a 130,000 square-foot factory to accommodate demand. In 1990, the company added bodies for dual rear-wheel van chassis for the first time. \n\nIn the early 1990s, the company introduced its first full-size buses, the EMC 1st Premier conventional (EMC=Enterprises Michel Corbeil), using an International 3800 chassis (with Ford B800 as an option). In 1993, the EMC3900 was introduced; sharing its International 3900 chassis with the AmTran Genesis, the EMC3900 was a front-engine transit-style bus. For the United States bus market, Corbeil concentrated on its small bus offerings, not selling the 1st Premier or the EMC3900 outside of Canada. For 1994, Corbeil entered a joint venture with Indiana-based manufacturer Carpenter, manufacturing single rear-wheel buses marketed through its deal network (similar to a joint venture between Blue Bird and Girardin); the joint venture lasted through 1998. \n\nIn 1995, Corbeil changed its company emblem, shifting from a vertical EMC to a large smiley face on the roofline of the bus, with the design becoming one of the most widely recognized manufacturer emblems in the transportation industry. WIth the addition of the \"smiley face\", the EMC 1st Premier was renamed the Corbeil Conventional. \n\nIn 2000, Corbeil produced a rear-engine transit-style bus using an International 3000 chassis. Similar in configuration to the AmTran RE, very few examples of the Corbeil Rear Engine were produced; all were sold in Canada. \n\nIn 2001, Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil underwent several major changes. Following poor sales, the Corbeil Rear Engine was withdrawn, alongside the EMC3900 front-engine bus. The body of Corbeil minibuses and conventionals underwent several revisions, largely distinguished by the warning light surrounds. \n\nDuring the early 2000s, Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil struggled to compete. In 1999, Carpenter shifted exclusively towards production of full-size buses, effectively ending its joint distribution agreement with Corbeil (before closing its operations forever in 2001). In the mid-2000s, IC Corporation (the successor to AmTran/Ward) commenced sales of full-size buses in Canada, largely taking the place of the discontinued Corbeil Conventional and EMC3900. \n\nIn September 2007, after 22 years of assembly, Corbeil shut down its operations. \n\nIn late 2007, Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil was acquired by Collins Bus Corporation, with Collins purchasing the assets, designs, naming rights and warranties of Corbeil. In a major change, Corbeil transitioned from a stand-alone manufacturer to a regional product line of Collins Bus Corporation, consolidating headquarters from Quebec to the Hutchinson, Kansas facility of Collins. The parent company of Mid Bus, in 2007, Collins consolidated production of all three bus product ranges in its Kansas facility, with the first American-produced Corbeils assembled before 2008. As the company restarted bus production, Corbeil offered the Collins Bantam product line under the Corbeil Quantum nomenclature. \n\nTo minimize internal competition, Collins marketed itself, Mid Bus, and Corbeil in different regions of North America. As before, Corbeil production was marketed primarily in Canada (Quebec and Ontario) and New England. In 2012, the Quantum naming scheme was retired as Collins introduced the NexBus bodyshell for all three of its brands (shifting towards a naming scheme naming buses by function). \n\nDuring the 2010s, Collins has consolidated from three vehicle brands to one. In 2013, Mid Bus (the final remaining entity of the bus manufacturer Superior) was withdrawn. In 2016, Collins ended the use of the Corbeil brand in Canada in favor of using the Collins brand across North America.\n\n\n"}

In 1621, he became a hegumen at Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery. In January 1627, Joasaphus was appointed archbishop of Pskov and Velikiye Luki. He is known for his protection of Pskov's trade privileges and resistance to pretensions of the German merchants, for which he would be punished by the patriarch.\n\nUpon Philaret's death in 1634, Joasaphus was appointed his successor, upon his recommendation. His selection to the role of Patriarch was held in the traditional way: The Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church (knowing in advance the will of Mikhaill Romanov) pointed to three candidates, of whom the Tsar could choose. Enthronement of the new Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church was held, also in keeping with tradition, the council of the Dormition of the Mother of God in the Kremlin in Moscow on 6 February 1634.\n\nOne of Joasaphus' first deeds was severe punishment of Joseph Kurtsevich, Archbishop of Suzdal, for his indecent behaviour. He took part in reviving Moscow's printing activities. They published 23 ecclesiastic books under his supervision. In 1636, Joasaphus wrote \"Память\" (Pamyat, or memo), in which he urged Russian clergymen to settle all the discords between themselves. He also published a piece called \"Лестница властям\" (Lestnitsa vlastyam, or Hierarchy of power), in which he explained the hierarchy of clergymen during divine services and sobors. Also, Joasaphus published the so-called \"Требник\" (Trebnik, or book of prayers) with a supplement of Philaret's resolutions and decrees.\n\nAs Patriarch, he did not interfere in affairs of state policy and refused to even granting the tsar advice in this regard, thereby the strengthening process the position of the Patriarchate in the country declined. He focused instead on efforts to moral renewal of society. He aimed for the effective implementation of the provisions of the Council of the Hundred Chapters in terms of arrangement of worship, opposed the custom of simultaneous execution of several passages of worship at the same time and false jurodiwych.\nJoasaphus I is buried in the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin.\n\nMost historians assess Josaphus as a colorless figure. According to the historian Parsley such determination activities of the patriarch is unfair, because the lack of interest of Josaphus for state affairs did not mean lack of involvement in the problems of the Orthodox Church, where the latter showed the energy and determination. Parsley also points out that the relatively short period of office of the patriarch by Joazafa results in the obfuscation of its achievements and the personalities of the two other seventeenth-century Russian Orthodox Church superiors: Filaret and Nikon. At the same time the authors of works devoted to Josaphus give it a raw ascetic, pious and humble man.\n"}

The term commonly indicates that an external agent, such as a merchant or the government, has set a price level, which may not be changed for individual sales. In the case of governments, this may be due to price controls.\n\nBargaining is very common in many parts of the world outside of retail stores in Europe or North America or Japan, making fixed prices an exception from the general norm of pricing in these areas.\n\nA fixed-price contract is a contract where the contract payment does not depend on the amount of resources or time expended by the contractor, as opposed to cost-plus contracts. These contracts are often used in military and government contractors to put the risk on the side of the vendor and control costs.\n\nHistorically, when fixed-price contracts are used for new projects with untested or developmental technologies, the programs may fail if unforeseen costs exceed the ability of the contractor to absorb the overruns. In spite of this, such contracts continue to be popular. Fixed-price contracts tend to work when costs are well known in advance. \n\n"}

Krapf played an important role in exploring East Africa with Johannes Rebmann. They were the first Europeans to see Mount Kenya with the help of Kikuyus who dwelled at its slopes and Kilimanjaro. Krapf also played a key role in exploring the East African coastline.\n\nKrapf was born into a Lutheran family of farmers in southwest Germany. From his school days onward he developed his gift for languages. He initially studied Latin, Greek, French and Italian. Other more languages were to follow throughout his life. After finishing school he joined the Basel Mission Seminary at age 17 but discontinued his studies as he had doubts about his missionary vocation. He read theology at University of Tübingen and graduated in 1834. While working as an assistant village pastor, he met a Basel missionary who encouraged him to resume his missionary vocation.\n\nIn 1836 he was invited by the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) to join their work in Ethiopia. Basel Mission seconded him to the Anglicans and from 1837-1842 he worked in this ancient Christian land. He prepared himself by learning ancient Ge'ez and the Amharic language of the highlands. Landing at Tadjura, Krapf followed the trade route to Shewa where he presented himself to its ruler, Meridazmach Sahle Selassie, and later accompanied the Meridazmach on a military campaign in southern Shewa. Krapf's pietist background did not help him much to understand and appreciate traditional Ethiopian Christianity, especially their emphasis on saints, liturgy and use of Ge'ez, a language no longer spoken. When he departed Shewa in 1842, he found his way to Gondar blocked by the aftermath of the Battle of Debre Tabor, retraced his steps to the court of Adara Bille, a chieftain of the Wollo Amhara who then robbed him. Krapf managed to effect his escape with his servants, and made his way to Massawa supported by the reluctant charity of the local inhabitants.\n\nThus he centered his interest on the Oromo people of southern Ethiopia, in his time known as the Galla, who then were largely believers in a traditional religion. He learned their language and started translating parts of the New Testament into it. While 1842 saw Krapf receive a doctorate from University of Tübingen for his research into the Ethiopian languages, it also witnessed the expulsion of all Western missionaries from Ethiopia, which ended his work there. In association with his colleague, Carl Wilhelm Isenberg, he published a memoir of his time in Ethiopia, \"Journals of Isenberg and Krapf\" in 1843. He revised Abu Rumi's Bible translations into Amharic for BFBS.\n\nKrapf spent some time in Alexandria, Egypt, where he married. From there he set off for East Africa hoping to reach the Oromo from what is now the Kenyan coast. Most of the East African coastline was then part of the Zanzibar sultanate. Sultan Sayyid Said gave him a permit to start a missionary station at the coastal city of Mombasa. Krapf started again by learning the languages of the local Mijikenda people and also Swahili which is an East African lingua franca language of communication.\n\nSoon after arrival in Mombasa his wife and young daughter suffered and died from malaria. Krapf moved to the higher grounds of Rabai on the coastal hills and started his station New Rabai. Here he wrote the first dictionary and grammar of the Swahili language. He also started studying other African languages, drafting dictionaries and translating sections of the Bible. Working with a Muslim judge named Ali bin Modehin, he translated Genesis. He went on to translate the New Testament, as well as the Book of Common Prayer. However, most of this was unpublished, though it was later used in revising a translation in a more southern version of Swahili.\n\nIn 1846 he was joined by Johannes Rebmann, another southwest German Lutheran who was in the service of the CMS. Krapf and Rebmann set off to explore the interior of East Africa and they were the first Europeans to see the snowcapped mountains of Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. They sent reports about them to Europe which were ridiculed by the experts.\n\nKrapf's deteriorating health forced him to return to Germany in 1853. He brought with him several old Swahili manuscripts, including copies of the \"Book of the Battle of Tambuka\", the earliest Swahili manuscript. In Korntal he continued his linguistic studies and advisory work for the Christian missions.\n\n\n• Vocabulary of the Galla Language, London 1842.\n• Vocabulary of six East African languages.

The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust was responsible for the delivery of the programme. At the end of the status there were nearly 3,000 specialist schools, which was fully 88% of the state-funded secondary schools in England.\nWhen the new Coalition government took power in May 2010 the scheme was ended and funding was absorbed into general school budgets.\n\nThe Education Reform Act 1988 introduced a new compulsory subject of Technology, but there were insufficient funds to equip all schools to teach the subject.\nA first attempt at developing centres of excellence, the City Technology College programme between 1988 and 1993, had produced only 15 schools.\nIn 1994, the Conservative government, at the urging of Sir Cyril Taylor, designated 35 grant-maintained and voluntary aided schools as Technology Colleges.\nThe schools were required to arrange private sponsorship of £100,000, and would then receive a matching government capital grant and increased recurrent funding.\nThe following year the programme was opened to all maintained schools, and specialism in Languages was added.\nSpecialisms in Arts and Sport were added in 1996.\n\nAs specialism implied diversity of schools, it was opposed by many supporters of comprehensive schools, including many in the Labour Party.\nNevertheless, in 1997 the new Labour government, also encouraged by Sir Cyril Taylor, adopted the embryonic programme, and the number of specialist schools continued to grow.\nThe School Standards and Framework Act 1998 made it possible for specialist schools to select up to 10% of their intake on aptitude in the existing specialisms in sport, the arts, modern languages and technology, though new selection for aptitude in technology was prohibited in 2008.\nHowever few have taken up this option.\n\nThe 2001 white paper \"Schools Achieving Success\" envisaged expansion of the programme to 50% of secondary schools by 2005, and introduced new specialisms in Business and Enterprise, Engineering, Mathematics and Computing and Science.\nThe emphasis was shifting from centres of excellence to a means of driving up standards in most schools.\nThe required amount of private sponsorship was halved, and could be made up of goods and services in lieu of cash.\nSoftware donations had been ineligible due to the difficulty in evaluating the true value of something that has no manufacturing cost and can simply be given away as a form of collateral, but this changed when Oracle and then Microsoft were allowed to sponsor the programme with \"in kind\" donations.\nIn 2002 the government introduced the Partnership Fund, funded at £3 million per annum, to make up the shortfall for schools that were unable to raise the required £50,000 of private sponsorship.\nSpecialisms in Humanities and Music were added in 2004.\nBy 2008 approximately 90% of maintained secondary schools had become specialist schools.\n\nExtension of the specialist programme to primary schools is being trialled at 34 schools in England, starting in 2007.\nThe specialisms involved in the pilot are Arts, Music, Languages, Science and Physical Education/Sport.\nA specialist schools programme has been trialled by the Department of Education of Northern Ireland from 2006, with 44 schools being awarded the status by September 2009.\n\nTo apply for specialist school status, a school must demonstrate reasonable standards of achievement, and produce a four-year development plan with quantified targets related to learning outcomes. The school must also raise £50,000 in private sector sponsorship.\nPrivate sector sponsorship includes charitable trusts, internal fund raising and donations from private companies. In some cases donations can be made in cash from entities in the private sector such as Arcadia and HSBC, but may also be donations \"in kind\" of goods or services. The total sponsorship to date is of the order of £100m.\n\nA school may specialise in any of the following fields, or combine specialisms in two of them (at the same level of funding):\n\nSpecialist schools must still meet the full requirements of the English national curriculum, so the specialism is seen as adding value to the existing statutory provision rather than being a radical departure from it. The important aspect in the eyes of the government is the focus that the specialism provides for providing leadership in the quest for whole school improvement.\n\nThe reward for achieving specialist status is a government grant of £100,000 to go with the £50,000 in sponsorship for a capital project related to the specialism and an extra £129 per pupil per year for four years to support the development plan. This is normally targeted on additional staffing and professional development, though up to 30% may be spent on equipment.\n\nSchools that make a good attempt at achieving their targets over the 4 year development plan period normally have their grants renewed at 3-year intervals with no further need to raise sponsorship. However since 2008, the government has sought to encourage long-term relationships with business partners by offering a matching grant to redesignating specialist schools that are able to raise a further £25,000 in private sponsorship.\n\nSome schools that demonstrated that they were achieving significantly higher results than other schools were invited to apply to be designated as High Performing Specialist Schools. This typically allowed the school to apply for a further specialism, which brought with it additional funding so that the school could develop that further specialism.\nBy 2009 some 900 schools (30% of specialist schools) had achieved this status.\n\nDavid Jesson of the University of York published a series of annual studies of the results of the specialist schools program, on behalf of the SSAT.\nThese studies reported that non-selective specialist schools achieved significantly higher results at GCSE results than non-specialist comprehensive schools, that they achieved higher 'added value' when prior achievement was taken into account, and that the gains had increased with the length of time the school had been specialist.\nJesson's statistical methodology was criticised, and others pointed out that early specialist schools were chosen for the programme because they were already successful.\nOther studies found that specialist schools performed slightly better at GCSE, particularly benefitting more able pupils and narrowing the gap between boys and girls.\nSubsequent studies attributed the increase to the additional funding, and reported that the effect was diminishing as a greater proportion of schools become specialist.\n\nSpecialist schools and academies were promoted, notably by Estelle Morris (Education Secretary 2001–2002), as part of an attempt to improve standards by 'increasing diversity' in secondary schools.\nLeft wing commentators had criticised this move away from the comprehensive ideal.\nThe two biggest UK teaching unions had opposed the programme because they said that it created a two-tier education system, made up of specialist schools with extra funding and non-specialist schools which could not have benefited from any extra money.\n\nThere was also evidence that specialist schools took fewer children from poorer families than non-specialist schools.\nOne possible cause was that it may have been easier for middle-class parents to raise the necessary sponsorship.\n\n"}

It was the first album after the band reformed in 1975 and was recorded after a European tour.\n\nAs the first self-produced album by the band, it featured a tighter, more pared-down sound than the band's earlier recordings with producer John Anthony. Hammill said \"we did not want to make 'Son of \"Pawn Hearts\"' with a big long side two and lots of studio experiments\". Van der Graaf Generator would never work with an outside producer from this point forward. Hammill made extensive use of the Hohner Clavinet D6 keyboard, which he had first using on his previous solo album, \"Nadir's Big Chance\" (1975).\n\nThe first release of the record in the United States was on Mercury Records. The 2005 reissue added live performances by the band of two songs from Peter Hammill's album \"The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage\" (1974), recorded at a concert at L'Altro Mondo, Rimini, Italy.\n\n\"Godbluff\"s album cover was minimal, consisting of a band logo and \"stamped\" red album title on an otherwise black sleeve. The band logo that first appeared here was designed by John Pasche; it would also be used on the next two albums, \"Still Life\" (April 1976) and \"World Record\" (October 1976). \"Godbluff\"s sleeve design was later parodied on the cover of \"Fall Heads Roll\" by The Fall.\n\nIn \"Melody Maker\", the reviewer said that \"in a very real sense, [\"Godbluff\"] is the sound of the mid-seventies: uncomfortable, coherent, unremitting, courageous.\" Geoff Barton of \"Sounds\" deemed \"Godbluff\" \"simply, an essential buy.\" A negative review appeared in the \"Lancashire Evening Post\" in November 1975, in which Bob Papworth wrote that \"\"Godbluff\" is a lengthy exhibition of the type of studiously avant-garde rock which so many other groups play infinitely better.\" Papworth added that \"Guy Evans couldn't drum his way out of a paper bag and David Jackson's saxes and flutes are a little too simplistic to be credible.\"\n\nIn his 2011 AllMusic review, Steve McDonald wrote: \".. the album opened with daring quietness, with David Jackson's flute echoing across the stereo space, joined by Hammill's voice as he whispered the opening lines. There was sturm und drang to come, but the music had been opened up and the lyrics had developed more focus, often abandoning metaphor in favor of statement. \"Godbluff\" was a bravura comeback - only four cuts, but all were classics.\"\n\nIn a May 2002 review in \"Mojo\" magazine, Julian Cope said of the album: \"It was the best re-formation ever. \"Godbluff\" was every inch a classic. It conjured up vast tracts of heathland, the burning huts of herdsmen, hordes of chariot maniacs trashing farmsteads, heads on javelins stuck in. And Hammill standing amidst all this, Zoroaster-like and mystified, searching desperately and eloquently for some semblance of moral where there was none.\"\n\nAll tracks written by Peter Hammill, except where indicated.\n\n\n\n"}

The production, largely a police procedural, features Humphrey Bogart and is based on the Murder, Inc. trials.\n\nThe action is set in an unnamed American city and is told mainly in flashback, and flashbacks within flashbacks.\n\nUnder heavy police protection, gangster Joe Rico (Ted de Corsia) arrives late at night at the courthouse to testify against crime lord Albert Mendoza (Everett Sloane). There have been several attempts on Rico's life and he is a bag of nerves, but lead prosecutor ADA Martin Ferguson (Humphrey Bogart) reminds him that he himself faces plenty of charges that could \"burn you a dozen times\". Ferguson is bound and determined to get Mendoza \"in the electric chair\" and stresses to Rico that Mendoza will \"die, he's got to die, and you're going to kill him.\"\n\nAfter yet another attempt on his life, Rico gives his bodyguards the slip and tries to escape by reaching the fire escape on the eighth floor of the building, but he falls off the ledge and is killed on impact when he hits the courtyard.\n\nRico was the only evidence Ferguson had against Mendoza, who will walk away in the morning as a free man. However, he believes that something else came up in the course of the investigation that might make the case—if only he could remember it. He and police Capt. Nelson (Roy Roberts) decide to go through the evidence hoping that something will come up.\n\nThe case began when a distraught man named James \"Duke\" Malloy (Michael Tolan), a small-time gangster and strongarm-man, burst into a police station and claimed to have killed his girlfriend, under pressure from others. At the crime scene, which is out in the countryside, the police find an empty grave. Malloy, overcome with grief, bitterly explains that his girlfriend was a \"contract\" and a \"hit\", terms which mean nothing to the officers. He later commits suicide in his cell.\n\nFerguson, the ADA in charge of homicide, is brought in on the case. Malloy only had convictions for petty crimes, not murder, but a check of his associates leads the investigators to \"Big Babe\" Lazick (Zero Mostel). Lazick refuses to talk, but when Ferguson threatens to jail his wife and put his little son into foster care, Lazick confesses that he is part of a \"troop\" (a group of killers) operating under the orders of Joe Rico who gets requests to commit murders over the telephone from a third party. The gang uses terms like \"contract\" (a request to commit murder) and \"hit\" (the actual killing) in case others—mainly the cops—are listening in. The killers get a regular salary (even if they go to jail), their families are looked after if anything goes wrong and bonuses are paid for actual killings. Only Rico knows who the top boss is.\n\nThe killers carry out murders for profit, the idea being that they are hired to kill someone at the request of someone else (the person's spouse or business partner, for example). The killer will have no motive for committing the crime and thus will not be suspected by the police, while the client with the motive will have a perfect alibi. Furthermore, the client has to keep contributing money in case of exposure.\n\nLazick leads the police to the body of Nina Lombardo, Malloy's girlfriend whose murder started the investigation. It emerges that she was a contract whom Malloy was supposed to kill, but he instead fell in love with her. He tried to cover it up but his associates caught up with them and forced him to kill her. Nina's roommate, Teresa Davis (Patricia Joiner) tells the detectives that Nina's real name was Angela Vetto and that she was in hiding since her father's death. Ten years beforehand Angela and her father, a cab driver, witnessed the murder of John Webb, a café owner.\n\nThe police eventually find a mass grave filled with dozens of bodies. As the authorities close in on them, the gang begins to break up. Some go into hiding, fearing for their lives as others are killed by other members from out of town. Rico himself is hiding on a farm with his last remaining accomplices. He calls his boss, whose answers do not reassure him. Rico pretends to go to town for a contract but instead parks his car behind some bushes. He later witnesses his accomplices being murdered by a pair of hired killers sent by his boss to silence everyone—including Rico.\n\nRico contacts Ferguson. In return for being spared the death penalty, he offers to testify against his boss, Mendoza. Rico first met Mendoza when the latter tried to interfere in a bookmaking racket run by Rico's previous employer. Impressed by the beating he got from Rico, Mendoza took him to a café and explained the concept of his new business: murder for profit. To prove his point he killed the café owner, John Webb, for which he received $500. However, the killing was witnessed by Tony Vetto (Tito Vuolo) and his daughter. Mendoza and Rico got away, but years later Vetto recognized Mendoza as a cab fare and was murdered by Rico, on orders from Mendoza, before he could go to the police.\n\nWith Rico now dead, Mendoza will walk. Frustrated, Ferguson goes to Mendoza's cell and leaves him with photos of his victims, warning him of the nightmares that they will give him. He then returns to the evidence room and listens to a tape made of Rico's confession — which is not admissible in court. In it, Rico describes Vetto's daughter as having \"big blue eyes\"; Ferguson remembered that Nina Lombardo (assumed to be Angela Vetto) had brown eyes. On the other hand, her roommate, Teresa Davis, did have blue eyes. Ferguson concludes that Nina was pointed out as Duke's contract by mistake. Teresa told the police that Nina was Angela Vetto as a hint: to get them on the trail of the killers without getting involved herself; she even tried to leave town, but Ferguson warned her against it.\n\nHowever, from Nina's photo, Mendoza has come to the same conclusion and, through his attorney, sends two of his remaining men after the real Angela Vetto. Ferguson and Nelson arrive at her house to learn that she has gone shopping. The streets are too crowded for them to find her, so Ferguson uses a music store's sidewalk loudspeakers to warn her that her life is in danger and to contact him at the store. Angela does so and Ferguson sets off to meet her, followed by the killers. In the subsequent shootout, Ferguson kills one of the gangsters and the other is arrested. He then escorts Angela Vetto to testify against Mendoza and put him in the chair.\n\n\nDirector Bretaigne Windust, an accomplished Broadway director, fell seriously ill during the beginning of shooting, so Raoul Walsh was brought in to finish the film. Walsh refused to take the credit, calling it Windust's work.\n\nThis was Bogart's last film for Warner Bros., the studio that had made him a star. Warner only distributed the film. It was produced by United States Pictures, and is now owned by Republic Pictures, a division of Paramount Pictures.\n\nAlthough largely fictional, the film is based on the real-life investigation into a group of hired killers dubbed by the press as \"Murder, Inc.\" (the film was released under that title in the United Kingdom). It was during this investigation, and the Kefauver hearings, that terms like \"contract\" (a deal to commit a murder) and \"hit\" (the actual killing itself) first came into the public knowledge. The gangsters used such codes in case of eavesdroppers or phone tappings by the police.\n\nBogart's ADA Martin Ferguson is based on Burton Turkus, who led the prosecutions of several members of the Murder, Inc. gang. His book on the case was published at about the same time the film was released.\n\nTed de Corsia's Joe Rico was probably inspired by Abe Reles. Like Rico, Reles was about to testify against a major crime lord but, although under heavy police guard, was found dead after falling out of the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island on November 12, 1941. It has never been established for sure if Reles' death was murder, accident or suicide.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,584,000 domestically and $1,289,000 foreign.\nWhen the film was released the staff at \"Variety\" magazine praised director Windust, writing, \"The film plays fast and excitingly in dealing with Humphrey Bogart’s efforts to bring the head of a gang of killers to justice. The script uses the flashback technique to get the story on film, but it is wisely used so as not to tip the ending and spoil suspense ... Bretaigne Windust’s direction is thorough, never missing an opportunity to sharpen suspense values, and the tension builds constantly.\"\n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz questioned if the film should be labeled as film noir, writing, \"The crime film tells for the first time in film how a mob works and its use of terms such as 'contract', 'hit', and 'finger man.' It is shot in a semi-documentary style and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film critics have classified it under.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1863525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863525", "title": "The Firm (rock band)", "text": "The Firm (rock band)\n\nThe Firm were a British rock supergroup formed in 1984, featuring singer Paul Rodgers (Free and Bad Company), guitarist Jimmy Page (The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin), drummer Chris Slade (Manfred Mann's Earth Band, Uriah Heep and AC/DC) and bass player Tony Franklin.\n\n\"Jimmy was at a bit of a loose end,\" recalled Rodgers of the band's formation. \"He'd come round and check out my home studio and we ended up writing songs, but without any definite plans. Jimmy was very keen to get on the road, so we put a band together… The first thing I knew was that he had to be writing songs again. I'd already seen one of my friends going down that road in Koss, and it wasn't going to happen again.\"\n\nPage and Rodgers refused to play material by their former bands and instead opted for a selection of Firm songs plus tracks from their solo albums; however, at least one performance of \"Midnight Moonlight\" featured sections of \"White Summer\" and \"Kashmir\", originally recorded by Page's former bands The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin, respectively. The new songs were heavily infused with a soulful and commercially accessible sound, courtesy of Franklin's fretless bass guitar underpinning an understated song structure. Despite refusing to play old material, the last track from \"The Firm\", \"Midnight Moonlight\", was originally an unreleased Led Zeppelin song entitled \"Swan Song\". This caused some critics to claim that Page had begun to run out of ideas. \n\nIn subsequent interviews, Page indicated that the band was never meant to last more than two albums. After the band split, Page and Rodgers returned to solo work while Chris Slade joined AC/DC in 1989 and Franklin teamed up with guitarist John Sykes and drummer Carmine Appice in Blue Murder.\n\n\n\nThe band played only two UK concerts on this tour: one at Middlesbrough Town Hall, and one at the London Hammersmith Odeon. In addition to Firm songs, the band played solo material by Rodgers and Page. This included Paul Rodgers singing \"Live in Peace\" from his earlier solo album. \n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1934 and includes savannah, montane and swamp habitats. The park is named for the Kagera River which flows along its eastern boundary feeding into Lake Ihema and several smaller lakes. The complex system of lakes and linking papyrus swamps makes up over a third of the park, which is the largest protected wetland in Eastern-Central Africa.\n\nAkagera National Park was founded in 1934 by the Belgian government, which at the time occupied Rwanda. The park was large and was known for its biodiversity.\n\nAkagera used to have a large population of African wild dogs. At one point, it was known as the 'Parc aux Lycaons' and wild dogs were so abundant, that the Belgian government considered them a pest. However, a disease epidemic diminished the population and the last wild dogs were seen in 1984.\n\nIn 1957, black rhinos were introduced from Tanzania. In the 1970s, more than 50 black rhinos lived in the savannah-habitat of the park. Due to widespread poaching, the population declined over the following decades, and the last confirmed sighting was in 2007. In 1986, Masai giraffes were introduced from Kenya. Their population has grown to over 80 individuals in recent years.\nAround 1990, Akagera was known to have a population of 250 to 300 lions. In the years following the Rwandan Civil War, the entire population was killed by farmers who returned to Rwanda after the War and settled in the park.\n\nIn 2009 the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and the African Parks Network entered into a 20-year renewable agreement for the joint management of Akagera. The Akagera Management Company was formed in 2010 as the joint management body for Akagera National Park. Over the next 5 years a $10 million expenditure was carried out in the national park area, with financial help from the Howard Buffett Foundation. The aim was to increase the security of the national park and to reintroduce locally extinct species. Security measures that were taken include: the construction of a western boundary fence which measures , deploying an air surveillance helicopter, training of an expert rhino tracking and protection team and a canine anti-poaching unit.\n\nIn July 2015, seven lions from South Africa were introduced and released in the park, making them the first lions in Rwanda for 15 years. \"AndBeyond\" donated five lionesses from Phinda Private Game Reserve. and Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu-Natal donated two male lions. This effort was described by African Parks as \"a ground-breaking conservation effort for both the park and the country\" as part of a project aimed at reversing the local extinction of the species in Akagera National Park. Since 2015, the population has grown to almost 40 animals and it keeps growing.\n\nIn May 2017, a joint operation between the Rwanda Development Board and African Parks saw the reintroduction of around 20 Eastern black rhinoceroses from South Africa, which had been absent for 10 years. With the reintroduction of black rhinos and lions, the national park is now home to all of Africa's \"big five\": lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros, and buffalo.\n\nDuring June 2019, Akagera received a further 5 Eastern black rhinoceros from 3 different zoos in 3 different countries located across Europe. The zoos includes Dvur Kralove zoo from the Czech Republic, Flamingo Land from the UK and Ree Park Safari from Denmark. This relocation is the first of its kind, as something like this between Europe and Africa never happened before. The 2 males and 3 females were safely delivered to the park after a 30 hour journey. These mammals are direct descendants from rhinos taken from Africa during the colonial days.\n\nThe large mammal population has increased since 2010, from 4000 animals in 2010 to over 13,500 in 2018.\n\nSince African Parks assumed management, in partnership with the Rwanda Development Board, of the park in 2010, tourism has dramatically increased. In 2010, 8,000 people visited the park. This number rose to 44,000 by 2018. This increase has allowed Akagera to become 80% self-sustaining and therefore less reliant on donors. \n\n"}

He was born Étienne Nicolas Marie Béchet, Sieur de Rochefontaine.\n\nBorn in Ay, Marne France, Rochefontaine came to America in 1778 after failing to gain a position in the French Royal Corps of Engineers. He volunteered in General Washington's Continental Army on May 15, 1778 and was appointed captain in the Corps of Engineers on September 18, 1778. For his distinguished services at the siege of Yorktown, Rochefontaine was given the brevet rank of major by Congress, November 16, 1781.\n\nHe returned to France in 1783 and served as an infantry officer, reaching the rank of colonel in the French Army. He came back to the United States in 1792 and anglicized his first name to Stephen. President Washington appointed him a civilian engineer to fortify the New England coast, in 1794.\n\nAfter the new Corps of Artillerists and Engineers was organized, Washington made Rochefontaine a lieutenant colonel and commandant of the new Corps on February 26, 1795. Rochefontaine started a military school at West Point in 1795, but the building and all his equipment were burned the following year. He left the Army on May 7, 1798, and lived in New York City, where he died January 30, 1814.

He served as United States Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan from 1985 to 1989. He is a professor at Harvard Law School and has been a visiting professor at Columbia Law School. He also serves on the board of the nonpartisan group, the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nFried is the author of nine books and over 30 journal articles, and his work has appeared in over a dozen collections.\n\nFried was born in 1935 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where his father was an important industrialist and Czech patriot. The Frieds left Czechoslovakia in 1939 to escape the anticipated Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews, lived in England for almost two years and came to the United States in 1941 via Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He and his parents became United States citizens in 1948, after the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. After graduating from the Lawrenceville School in 1952, he attended Princeton University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1956. Fried then attended the University of Oxford, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degree in Jurisprudence, in 1958 and 1960, respectively, and was awarded the Ordronnaux Prize in Law (1958). In 1960, Fried received his Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from Columbia Law School, where he was a Stone Scholar. Subsequently, he served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II.\n\nFried is admitted to the bars of the United States Supreme Court, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and numerous U.S. courts of appeals. He argued 25 cases in front of the Supreme Court while in the Solicitor General's office. He has served as counsel to a number of major law firms and clients, and in that capacity argued several major cases, perhaps the most important being Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, both in the Supreme Court and in the Ninth Circuit on remand.\n\nFried's government service includes a year as Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States (1984–85) and a consulting relationship to that office (1983), as well as advisory roles with the Department of Transportation (1981–83) and President Ronald Reagan (1982). In October 1985, Reagan appointed Fried as Solicitor General of the United States. Fried had previously served as Deputy Solicitor General and Acting Solicitor General. As Solicitor General, he represented the Reagan Administration before the Supreme Court in 25 cases. In 1989, when Reagan left office, Fried returned to Harvard Law School.\n\nFrom September 1995 until June 1999, Fried served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, while teaching constitutional law at Harvard Law School as a Distinguished Lecturer. Prior to joining the court, Fried held the chair of Carter Professor of General Jurisprudence at Harvard Law School. On July 1, 1999, he returned to Harvard Law School as a full-time member of the faculty and Beneficial Professor of Law. He has served on the Harvard Law School faculty since 1961, teaching courses on appellate advocacy, commercial law, constitutional law, contracts, criminal law, federal courts, labor law, torts, legal philosophy, and medical ethics.\nFried has published extensively. He is the author of nine books and over 30 journal articles, and his work has appeared in over a dozen collections. Unusually for a law professor without a graduate degree in philosophy, he has published significant work in moral and political theory only indirectly related to the law; \"Right and Wrong\", for instance is an impressive general statement of a Kantian position in ethics with affinities with the work of Thomas Nagel, John Rawls, and Robert Nozick. On September 27, 2010, he and Gregory Fried discussed their book \"Because It Is Wrong: Torture, Privacy, and Presidential Power in the Age of Terror\" at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. To see the discussion, click the link below. Fried has been Orgain Lecturer at the University of Texas (1982), Tanner Lecturer on Human Values at Stanford University (1981), and Harris Lecturer on Medical Ethics at the Harvard Medical School (1974–75). He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1971–72. Fried is a member of the National Academy of Sciences's Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Law Institute.\n\nIn September 2005, Fried testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the nomination of John Roberts to become Chief Justice of the United States. After the nomination of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, Fried praised Alito as an outstanding judge but dismissed claims that Alito is radical, saying, \"He is conservative, yes, but he is not radically conservative like Scalia.\" Fried testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and wrote a \"New York Times\" op-ed in support of Alito, who had served under him in the Solicitor General's office.\n\nOn October 24, 2008, despite his previous support for the presidential aspirations of Senator John McCain, Fried announced that he had voted for Senator Barack Obama for President by absentee ballot. Fried cited Senator McCain's selection of Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate as the principal reason for his decision to vote for Senator Obama. As president of the \"Harvard Law Review\" in 1990, Obama had published an article Fried wrote criticizing the effects of race-based affirmative action. Fried later told \"The Wall Street Journal\":\n\nI admire Senator McCain and was glad to help in his campaign, and to be listed as doing so; but when I concluded that I must vote for Obama for the reason stated in my letter, I felt it wrong to appear to be recommending to others a vote that I was not prepared to cast myself. So it was more of an erasure than a public affirmation—although obviously my vote meant that I thought that Obama was preferable to McCain-Palin. I do not consider abstention a proper option.\n\nIn February 2011, Fried testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of President Obama's health care reform law. When asked by Illinois Senator Richard Durbin to respond to critics of the law's individual mandate who ask: \"[I]f the government can require me to buy health insurance, can it require me to have a membership in a gym, or eat vegetables?,\" Fried replied:\n\nYes. We hear that quite a lot. It was put by Judge Vinson, and I think it was put by Professor Barnett in terms of eating your vegetables, and for reasons I set out in my testimony, that would be a violation of the 5th and the 14th Amendment, to force you to eat something. But to force you to pay for something? I don't see why not. It may not be a good idea, but I don't see why it's unconstitutional.\n\nFried is an adviser to the Harvard chapter of the Federalist Society. Having supported John Huntsman for the Republican nomination in 2012 and Governor John Kasich for the Republican nomination in 2016 Fried opposed the election of Donald Trump and voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863543", "title": "Atlantic Station", "text": "Atlantic Station\n\nAtlantic Station is a neighborhood on the northwestern edge of Midtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States comprising a retail district, office space, condominiums, townhomes and apartment buildings. First planned in the mid-1990s and officially opened in 2005, the neighborhood's 138 acres (558,000 m²) are located on the former brownfield site of the Atlantic Steel mill.\n\nAtlantic Station is located on the site of the Atlantic Steel mill, which opened in 1901. The steel mill was nearly closed in the mid-1970s, but it remained nominally operational primarily to avoid the huge costs it would have required to remediate the soil contamination present after years of operation.\n\nDeveloper Jim Jacoby, who also redeveloped Florida's Marineland, began putting the project together in 1997 when his company became the property contractor of the land. The redevelopment of the land into what is now Atlantic Station was financed largely by private investment, but was heavily supplemented by a special tax district to pay for city tax bonds for public utilities (streets, sidewalks, and sewers). The development was originally planned to include of retail, office, residential space as well as of public parks. Its size encouraged the Postal Service to award the neighborhood its own ZIP code: 30363.\n\nAtlantic Station was designed with energy efficiency in mind and many of the buildings are LEED certified. Additionally, the project was developed to help mitigate urban sprawl and reduce air pollution by allowing many more people to live and work within walking distance of most everyday things they need, with many alternative transportation options nearby. The proposed BeltLine transit/greenway project is expected to pass within a few miles of the development.\n\nIn October 2003, the very first residents moved into the development. The 17th Street bridge was completed in January 2004 and the first round of retail establishments opened in October 2005. Atlantic Station received the EPA's 2004 Phoenix Award as the Best National Brownfield Redevelopment, as well as the Sierra Club's 2005 America's Best New Development Projects listing.\n\nIn July 2005, a pre-dawn fire completely destroyed a large wood-frame residential building under construction. Two days later, it was ruled arson after a major investigation. In addition to the destruction of the 65-unit Element building, which was only framed-in at the time, another 80 inhabited units at the Art Foundry across Mecaslin Street had damage to the facade, including scorching, broken windows, and melted miniblinds. At least five million dollars of damage was done to the buildings, 18 cars parked on the street were destroyed and another 7 were seriously damaged from the intense heat.\n\nIn a joint venture, North American Properties Atlanta, founded by Mark Toro, and CB Richard Ellis Investors closed on the purchase of Atlantic Station's retail component on December 31, 2010. Toro and the NAP management launched a social media blitz, attended community meetings and real estate symposiums to openly discuss challenges, such as crime, and invite feedback. Toro's vision to transform Atlantic Station included new retail, new restaurants, better parking and a renewed effort to make Atlantic Station a destination for in-town residents.\n\nOn October 1, 2015, Atlantic Station's retail core was officially sold to Hines Interest Limited Partnership with an unnamed joint financial partner.\n\nAtlantic Station comprises three distinct areas that are lined along 17th Street between the Downtown Connector and Northside Drive, the District, the Commons, and the Village.\n\nThe District is where most of Atlantic Station's retail and office space is located. Opened on October 21, 2005, it was constructed in the style of an outdoor mall, with choices of shopping, dining, and a 16-screen Regal movie theater. Above the retail levels is an additional two to three stories of condominiums. With the 7,200-space parking garage underneath, the shopping area is pedestrian-friendly and many of the surface level streets are often closed off for special events. The southwest corner of The District is home to the 26-story, TWELVE Hotel and Residences Atlantic Station, which was completed in December 2005. In addition, townhomes constructed in 2004 line 16th Street one block south of The District.\n\nThe District's office space is located along the six-lane 17th Street Corridor, and is home to the 22-story tall 171 17th Street, known as the Wells Fargo Building and completed in 2004, and the 17-story 201 17th Street, completed in 2007. Developed by AIG Global Real Estate, 171 17th Street was awarded the silver certificate in the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Core and Shell Development program. 171 17th Street became the first-ever LEED Silver-Core and Shell certified high-rise office building, and the first high-rise office building in Georgia to receive any LEED certification. The 25-story BB&T Tower at 271 17th Street was completed in 2009, becoming Atlantic Station's tallest office tower. 271 was designed by tvsdesign and built by Brasfield & Gorrie.\n\nThe Commons is home to many low-rise condominiums, apartments, townhomes, and a large man-made stormwater retention pond that is located within the median of 17th Street. The Village is located on the westernmost portion of Atlantic Station, along 16th Street, and comprises an IKEA store that opened in 2005, as well as two apartment complexes.\n\nCurrent tenants include Athleta, The Athlete's Foot, Atlanta Falcons Official Team Store, Atlanta United Official Team Store, AT&T, Banana Republic, Bath & Body Works, Cellairis, Dermalogica, Dillard's, DSW, Earth and Sky Creations, Express, The Eye Gallery, Fab'rik, Francesca's, Gap, H&M, Icing, Ikea, It'Sugar, Jos A. Bank, Journey's, Kate's, Kinnucan's, LA Fitness, Loft, Lush Nail Bar, Old Navy, Publix, Regal Cinemas, Target, Tervis, Victoria's Secret, West Elm, and Z Gallerie.\n\nCurrent restaurant tenants include Atlantic Grill, BGR The Burger Joint, , California Pizza Kitchen, Chick-A-Biddy, Great American Cookies, Kilwins Chocolates & Ice Cream, Land of A Thousand Hills, NaanStop, The Pig & the Pearl, Subway, Yard House, Atlanta's first Salata, Gyu Kaku, Poke Bar, and Allora.\n\nThe Premier Exhibition Center at Atlantic Station is currently home to the exhibit \"\".\n\nAdjacent to the Commons pond is the Millennium Gate, an $18 million arch intended to celebrate peaceful accomplishment, with special attention paid to Georgia's rich history and people. The Millennium Gate opened July 4, 2008. As of 2008, it is the largest classical monument to have been dedicated since completion of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.. Hugh Petter of ADAM Architecture was commissioned by the National Monuments Foundation to work alongside National Monuments director, Rodney Cook Jr., to develop the initial concepts into the final architectural design. The design is embellished with a sculptural allegory by Alexander Stoddart, telling the story of peaceful accomplishment over the last 2000 years.\n\nIt houses of gallery space, featuring traditional and modern exhibits. Collections of artifacts and family histories contribute to exhibits showcasing the pioneering and philanthropic spirit behind the development of Atlanta. Other exhibits include a recreation of the 1928 Rhodes-Robinson House foyer located on West Paces Ferry Road and a recreation of Thomas K. Glenn's office. Mr. Glenn, the late chairman of Trust Company bank, in the 1930s ran Atlantic Steel, previous owner of the land that is now Atlantic Station. Glenn's family is among the project's supporters.\n\nThe Millennium Gate has been greeted with puzzlement regarding its purpose, and it has been criticized by Modernists for its historic references. To this, New York sculptor George Kelly responds that \"People are more drawn to tradition. It's the scale of it, it's the warmth of it. The word is beauty.\" Because of its proximity to the IKEA furniture store, some observers have given it the nickname \"Arc d’Ikea.\"\n\nThe Gate's exhibits are open to the public. The rooftop penthouse, Foyer gallery, and Oval Lawn are available for weddings, conferences, and other events by booking only. The Millennium Gate also serves as a museum, but is only open to the public by appointment.\n\nThe primary roadway access to and through Atlantic Station is an extension of 17th Street constructed by the developers. As part of the project, the Georgia Department of Transportation erected the yellow 17th Street bridge over the I-75/85 Downtown Connector expressway that separated Atlantic Station and the Home Park residential neighborhood from the rest of Midtown.\n\nControversy developed at the time of construction not only because of the bridge's unusual yellow color, but also for GDOT's insistence that the bridge and street meet suburban highway standards. Indeed, the bridge is eight lanes wide, and the enormous right-of-way afforded to 17th Street east of the bridge lacks street parking and utilizes an unusual arrangement of placing street trees and lamps at the edge of the adjacent buildings' property lines instead of against the street.

He set up his own workshop in the Sixties. He is well known for his book \"Cabinetmaking - a professional approach\" (re-published in 2009) and his revision (for the fourth edition) of Ernest Joyce's \"The Technique of Furniture Making\".\n\nIn 1990 he was awarded the OBE for his services to furniture and in 1998 he moved to Minehead in West Somerset. He was a main exponent of the seventies British Craft Revival. His work is rooted in tradition and shows a deep understanding and respect for his material wood. In 2009 fellow furniture designer maker Jeremy Broun made a film and wrote a book called \"Alan Peters - The Makers' Maker\". To a generation of British woodworkers in the seventies and eighties he is considered to be the greatest British furniture designer maker. He died on 11 October 2009 aged 76.\n\nHe is known for his particularly elegant furniture work, such as an adzed, fan-like table and a tabletop with a bowl carved into it. Although his work was influenced by Japanese woodworking, he rejected Japanese tools after experimenting with them. He is famed among other woodworkers and furniture makers for his use of the No. 7 plane - a particularly large and heavy one - for nearly everything.\nSince 2010 The Alan Peters Award for Excellence has been run as an annual award, established by Jason Heap, a designer maker and director of The Celebration of Craftsmanship and Design exhibitions. The award open to furniture makers under 30 years of age was set up to continue the important legacy of Alan Peters.\n\n"}

As an English major at Harvard University, he worked on the staff of the \"Harvard Lampoon\". He graduated in 1961 and moved to New York City to pursue a journalism career. He was an associate editor of \"Esquire\" from 1961 to 1969, editor of \"New York\" magazine from 1977 to 1979 and a columnist for \"Esquire\" from 1982 to 1994.\n\nBerendt published \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" in 1994 and became an overnight success; the book spent a record-breaking 216 weeks on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list — still, to this day, the longest standing best seller of the \"Times\". The story, unsettling and real, broke down the idea of the quintessential phenomenon of a true American city—only to reveal its quirks: its man walking an invisible dog; its voice of the drag queen; a high-society man in its elite community—all that somehow, unravels a murder mystery. Virtually seeming like a novel and reading like a tale, the non-fictional story is about the real-life events surrounding the murder trial of Jim Williams in Savannah, Georgia. Berendt acknowledged that he fabricated some scenes and changed the sequence of some events. The book was adapted into a 1997 film directed by Clint Eastwood. John Cusack plays a character loosely based on Berendt.\n\nBerendt's second book, \"The City of Falling Angels\", was published in September 2005. It chronicles interwoven lives in Venice in the aftermath of the fire that destroyed the La Fenice opera house. According to Kirkus Reviews, \"Berendt does great justice to an exalted city that has rightly fascinated the likes of Henry James, Robert Browning, and many filmmakers throughout the world.\" (August 1, 2005)\n\n"}

{"id": "1863563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863563", "title": "Pawn Hearts", "text": "Pawn Hearts\n\nPawn Hearts is the fourth album by English progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator, released in October 1971 on Charisma Records. The original album features just three tracks, including the side-long suite \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\". The album was not commercially successful in the UK, but reached number one in Italy. It has since seen retrospective critical praise and was reissued on CD in 2005 with extra material.\n\nThe songs for the album were worked out while on tour in 1971, with further development and arranging at manager Tony Stratton-Smith's house in Crowborough, Sussex over a two-month period. The original plan had been to release more material, making up a double album, but Charisma vetoed the idea. A non-album single, \"Theme One\" was included on some releases in the US and Canada. The album's strong commercial showing in Italy resulted in a number of lucrative promotional tours there, but the resulting pressure led to the band's split in August 1972.\n\nBy 1971, Van der Graaf Generator's line-up had stabilised as frontman and songwriter Peter Hammill, saxophonist David Jackson, organist and bassist Hugh Banton and drummer Guy Evans. The group had been gigging extensively and became close friends after a particularly gruelling tour of Germany. Hammill wrote \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" during the tour, and the group began performing \"Man-Erg\" towards its end. To alleviate the tedium of touring, the group invented games including \"Crowborough Tennis\" which involved bouncing a ball off a table, a photograph of which was eventually used as the inner sleeve for the album.\n\nFollowing the tour and in preparation for the album, Hammill invited producer John Anthony to his home, where Hammill played songs intended for the album unaccompanied on acoustic guitar and piano, allowing Anthony to take recording notes. \"Man Erg\" was written about the conflict between good and evil, represented as \"angels\" and \"killers\" in the song. \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" was inspired by Hammill's fascination with the sea, and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps seeing people die offshore. He feels guilty about not being able to help, and the song's ending is left open, leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace. Banton was against putting \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" on the album, wanting more commercial material such as the previous album \"H to He, Who Am the Only One's\" \"Killer\", but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement. The group moved to manager Tony Stratton-Smith's house, Luxford House, Crowborough, Sussex for two months in summer 1971 to rehearse material.\n\nRecording ran from July to September 1971 in Trident Studios. In addition to the band and Anthony, Robin Cable, David Hentschel and Ken Scott helped with engineering. The first tracks to be recorded were \"Theme One\", a cover of the George Martin composition used as the original closing theme to BBC Radio 1, and \"W\", which was ultimately left off the album. The music, particularly \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" was recorded in short sections between two and five minutes, which were later edited together. In addition to Hammill's original suite, Banton contributed the \"Pictures/Lighthouse\" section, an Olivier Messiaen-influenced organ piece, Evans wrote \"Kosmos Tours\" around a short piano riff, and Jackson wrote the music to the closing theme, \"We Go Now\". The piece was edited together by Banton and Anthony towards the end of the session. Banton used an effect called a \"psychedelic razor\", a customised tape recorder that could rewind and record simultaneously. The device appealed to the band's sense of humour. At one stage, every tape machine in the studio had to be used for mixing.\n\nThe album was originally conceived as a double album similar to Pink Floyd's \"Ummagumma\" (1969). The first half was made up of the album as released, while the second was to be divided between personal projects and live-in-studio versions of older Van der Graaf Generator songs such as \"Killer\" and \"Octopus\". Evans contributed an avant-garde piece, \"Angle of Incidents\" which featured drums being recorded backwards and the sound of a fluorescent lighting tube being dropped down the studio's stairs. Jackson recorded \"Ponker's Theme'\", a short jazz piece, and a longer piece, \"Archimedes Agnostic\", with Latin lyrics written by Hammill. Charisma ultimately felt that the group should simply release a single album, and vetoed the live and solo recordings.\n\nThe album's title came from a spoonerism by Jackson, who once said, \"I'll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn harts\", meaning \"horn parts\". The cover was designed by regular Charisma album artist Paul Whitehead, who was told by Hammill, \"no matter if you're a king, a pauper or whatever – you're a pawn\" which led to a design containing the earth and a curtain. The inner gatefold picture was taken by Keith Morris and featured the band playing Crowborough Tennis while appearing to give Nazi salutes to each other, though Banton later said this was simply the band attempting to look ridiculous in the vein of Monty Python.\n\nThe album was originally released in October 1971 on Charisma Records. In the US and Canada, the album was distributed via Buddah Records and contained \"Theme One\" as an extra track between \"Lemmings\" and \"Man-Erg\", which was done without the band's approval. In Europe, where \"Pawn Hearts\" only contained the three tracks, \"Theme One\" was released as a single in February 1972, with \"W\" as its B-side.\n\nWhen the Van der Graaf Generator catalogue was remastered for reissue in 2005, several of the tracks from the missing half of the album were found and added as bonus tracks. A live, in-studio version of \"Squid/Octopus\" was added to the \"H to He, Who Am the Only One\" reissue, while the \"Pawn Hearts\" reissue added \"Angle of Incidents\", \"Ponker's Theme\", and \"Diminutions\". The CD also contained the original mix of \"Theme One\", which is different to the one released as a single, and an earlier take of \"W\". \"Theme One\" was also released on the 2003 compilation CD \"The Best Prog Rock Album in the World... Ever.\"\n\nThe album was not commercially successful in the UK. A \"Record Mirror\" review said \"I have to confess complete ignorance of precisely what Van der Graaf Generator are trying to achieve\", though \"Melody Maker\" were more enthusiastic, saying \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" is one of the most fascinating and dramatic items I've ever heard\". However, the album reached number one on the Italian album charts.\nThe group toured Italy to promote the album, where they were treated like superstars and surrounded by army vehicles and riot police. They followed this with a short European tour, during which they filmed a live version of \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\" for Belgian television. The production took two hours to film as the band had not intended to perform the song live and had forgotten it. The resulting film shows Hammill singing the song while reading a lyric sheet. Regular tours of Europe followed over the next four months, but the strain of the workload became too much for the band, and they split up in August 1972.\n\nRetrospective reviews have been favourable. \"Q magazine\" called the album a \"misunderstood masterpiece\" while \"Mojo\" said it was \"one of the most extraordinary albums of its era\". Singer-songwriter Fish is a fan of the album, particularly of \"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\". Julian Cope has called the album \"a masterpiece\". Hammill has said, \"although a fairly extreme musical statement, [the album] contains some of our most cohesive work\".\n\nThough \"Theme One\" did not chart as a single in the UK, John Peel replaced Martin's original orchestral version with the group's before closing down Radio 1 each night. The BBC subsequently carried on using Van der Graaf Generator's version. Martin enjoyed the group's cover, calling it \"a powerful recording that respected the original\".\n\nTracks on 2005 reissue\nVan der Graaf Generator\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nTechnical\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

Murray considered missions to be \"the chief end of the church\".\n\nAndrew Murray was the second child of Andrew Murray Sr. (1794–1866), a Dutch Reformed Church missionary sent from Scotland to South Africa. He was born in Graaff Reinet, South Africa. His mother, Maria Susanna Stegmann, was of French Huguenot and German Lutheran descent.\n\nMurray was sent to the University of Aberdeen in Scotland for his initial education, together with his elder brother, John. Both remained there until they obtained their master's degrees in 1845. From there, they both went to the University of Utrecht where they studied theology. The two brothers became members of Het Réveil, a religious revival movement opposed to the rationalism which was in vogue in the Netherlands at that time. Both brothers were ordained by the Hague Committee of the Dutch Reformed Church on 9 May 1848 and returned to the Cape.\n\nMurray married Emma Rutherford in Cape Town, South Africa, on 2 July 1856. They had eight children together (four boys and four girls).\n\nIn 1846 they lived in the Minrebroederstraat (number unknown).\n\nFrom 1847-1848 they lived at the Zadelstraat 39.\n\nMurray pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860.\n\nIn 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission's name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with Serving In Mission (SIM) in 1998 and continues to this day. \n\nThrough his writings, Murray was also a key \"Inner Life\" or \"Higher Life\" or Keswick leader, and his theology of faith healing and belief in the continuation of the apostolic gifts made him a significant forerunner of the Pentecostal movement.\n\nIn 1894, Murray was visited by John McNeill and Rev. J Gelson Gregson, the ex-British Army Chaplain and Keswick convention speaker. \n\nMurray died on 18 January 1917, four months before his 89th birthday. He was so influenced by Johann Christoph Blumhardt's Möttlingen revival that he included a portion of Friedrich Zündel's biography at the end of With Christ in the School of Prayer.\n\nA bibliography compiled by D. S. B. Joubert estimates that Murray published over 240 books and tracts; this number includes about 50 books, many of them authored in both Dutch and English, including:\n\n"}

Several thousand species are placed in this family, many of which are well known for being serious plant pests. They are also the family of insects containing most plant virus vectors (around 200 known) with the green peach aphid (\"Myzus persicae\") being one of the most prevalent and indiscriminate carriers.\nAphids originated in the late Cretaceous about (Mya), but the Aphidinae which comprises about half of the 4700 described species and genera of aphids alive today come from their most recent radiation which occurred in the late Tertiary less than 10 Mya.\n\nMembers of the Aphididae are soft-bodied, pear-shaped insects called aphids, as are other members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Most of them have a pair of little tubes, called cornicles, projecting dorsally from the posterior of their abdomens. The cornicles have been variously interpreted in the past, either as organs of excretion, or for the production of honeydew, but in fact their only confirmed function to date is that they produce fatty alarm pheromones when the insects are attacked by predators.\n\nWhen wings are present they occur only on particular morphs called \"alates\", and wingless morphs are said to be \"apterous\". The forewing (mesothoracic wing) of the alate in the Aphididae has four to six veins attached to a major vein-like structure that has been interpreted as the combined stems of all the other major wing veins. That structure ends in a stigma, a solid spot on the anterior margin of the forewing. The rear (metathoracic) wings have a similar scheme, but simpler in structure, with no stigma The rear wing however, does bear a hamulus, a small hook that, when in flight, engages the claval fold of the forewing, keeping the wing beats in synchrony.\n\nAll aphids have very small eyes, sucking mouthparts in the form of a relatively long, segmented rostrum, and fairly long antennae.\n\nThese insects are so small (a few millimeters in length), that winds can transport them for fairly long distances. They are often green, but might be red or brown, as well. They move quite slowly and cannot jump or hop. Aphids excrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, because the plant sap from which they feed contains excess carbohydrates relative to its low protein content. To satisfy their protein needs, they absorb large amounts of sap and excrete the excess carbohydrates. Honeydew is used as food by ants, honeybees, and many other insects.\n\nThere are an extremely large number of aphid genera which are dealt with under each subfamily.

Bennett (August 12, 1918 – July 2, 2015) was an American songwriter known for the songs he wrote with Sid Tepper, which spawned several hits for Elvis Presley. Between 1945 and 1970, Tepper and Bennett published over 300 songs.\n\nBorn as Israel Brodsky into an Eastern European immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York, as a young boy he befriended a newly arrived neighbor by the name of Sid Tepper. Their mutual interest in music led to a highly successful music collaboration that spanned more than twenty-five years.\n\nBennett graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn, then he studied music at City College of New York. Although blessed with a good singing voice he chose to pursue his lifelong interest in writing words and music. His career plans were interrupted by World War II, however, when he served with the United States Army Air Forces. After the war he joined ASCAP and worked as a staff writer for Mills Music Inc. (now EMI Mills Music Inc.)\n\nPartnered with Tepper, between 1945 and 1970 Bennett had close to three hundred musical compositions published. In 1948 they wrote \"Red Roses for a Blue Lady\". Actor-singer John Laurenz (1909–1958) first recorded the song for Mercury Records in 1948. The original 78rpm single was issued on Mercury 5201.\n\nOn December 22, 1948 Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians recorded the song for Decca Records (#24549 A). Vocalist Vaughn Monroe had the best selling version of the song in 1949 for RCA Records. \nHis version was a No.3 hit single. The song has been recorded by others such as Wayne Newton, Vic Dana, Eddy Arnold, Johnny Tillotson and Andy Williams. Bennett and Tepper scored big again in 1951 when Rosemary Clooney recorded their composition \"Suzy Snowflake.\"\n\nIn 1955, their 1954 composition of \"Naughty Lady of Shady Lane\" was a top-10 hit for both Dean Martin and the Ames Brothers and the novelty song \"Nuttin' for Christmas\" by the Art Mooney band and singer Barry Gordon went to No. 6 on the music charts and was recorded by four other singers. In 1958, the popular singer and TV variety show host Perry Como had a top-10 hit with their \"Kewpie Doll.\"\n\nOther successful artists who recorded Bennett & Tepper songs include The Beatles (\"Glad All Over\" which appears on \"The Beatles At The BBC\"), Connie Francis, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Robert Goulet, Dinah Shore, Burl Ives, Eartha Kitt, Les Paul & Mary Ford, Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Marty Robbins, Jo Stafford, Wayne Newton, and Sarah Vaughan. While these songs were very important in the music world, they prospered significantly with the onset of rock and roll music. They wrote fifteen songs for British superstar Cliff Richard, including his biggest selling single ever, \"The Young Ones\" which was also used in Richard's 1961 motion picture of the same name and two decades later in the 1982–84 UK television series with the same title, \"The Young Ones\". In 2002, Mr. Bennett was invited to England to meet Cliff Richard and sang \"The Young Ones\" with him before an audience of 12,000 people in Birmingham.\n\nMost significant in his career are the forty-two songs recorded by Elvis Presley. These songs, co-written with Tepper, appear on a number of Presley's music albums and film soundtracks.\n\nTheir collaboration ended in the 1970s when Tepper suffered a heart attack and retired to Florida. Bennett remained active, and published the \"Choral Singer's Handbook\" which is still in print today. Fascinated by the desktop computer, he created a software program called PowerMacros for WordPerfect.\n\nIn 2002 Bennett and Tepper were honored at ceremonies in Memphis, Tennessee by Lisa Marie Presley for their contribution to her father's success. They were also honored for having written almost half the album in Presley fans favorite, \"Blue Hawaii\".

History and literature have ensured that most people are familiar with the islands of Elba and Montecristo.\n\nLegends says the archipelago originates from a necklace that Venus, the Roman goddess of beauty and sensuality, lost while emerging from the Tyrrhenian sea. The seven islands are in fact seven pearls the goddess was unable to retrieve.\n\nThe Tuscan Archipelago lies between Corsica and the Tuscan coast and contains seven major islands (Capraia, Elba, Giannutri, Giglio, Gorgona, Montecristo and Pianosa); all are protected as part of the Arcipelago Toscano National Park. The Archipelago extends from the northernmost island (Gorgona) to the southernmost (Giannutri) and from the westernmost (Capraia) to the Tuscan coast.\n\nMain Islands (from north to south):\nThere are several islets in the archipelago including: \n\n\nand skerries as: \n\n\nOthers islets and skerries that are not part of the archipelago:\n\nThe Tuscan Archipelago represents a region of correlation between the Sardinia-Corsica block and the Italian Peninsula; it is formed by seven islands and several islets and skerries which have different geological provenance as magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The origin of the archipelago dates to the Triassic period according to the type of the rocks.\n\nIn the Quaternary the archipelago was related to the sea level fluctuations due to the glacial and interglacial periods; in the last glaciation the sea level fell , and Elba became a peninsula joined to the continent and to Pianosa. The Würm glaciation was followed by a warming phase, and the sea rose slowly to reach its current level.\n\nThe archipelago is distinguished by some endemic taxa which are protected in order to avoid the loss of the biodiversity of fauna and flora. The most important are \"Oxychilus pilula\" of Capraia; and \"Oxychilus gorgonianus\" of Gorgona; \"Coenonympha corinna\", \"Podarcis muralis colosi\" and \"Vipera aspis francisciredi\" of Elba; and \"Vipera aspis montecristi\" of Montecristo. 31 species of mammals, several introduced, are known from the Tuscan archipelago, with the greatest diversity on Elba, with 24 species. The introduction of the wild boar to Elba several years ago has caused problems regarding the conservation of some plant species.\n\nAll the islands of the Tuscan Archipelago are a place where the migrant birds take a stop along their seasonal movement from north to south and vice versa; the favourite places are Gorgona, Palmaiola, Cerboli and Montecristo. The \"Falco peregrinus brookei\" nests on Elba and Capraia, the shearwater and the rare Audouin's gull are common on all the islands.\n\nThe rich productivity of the coastal waters provides habitats for various marine life, even dolphins and whales, including fin and sperm whales.\n\nThe archipelago is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with high insolation all year round. The archipelago's flora differs from island to island; the smaller have a vegetation similar each other of \"macchia mediterranea\" and garrigue formed by evergreen plants. Elba has a complex orography including the mountain Mount Capanne which favoured the preservation of the chestnut, the holm oak and the black alder mostly on the northern side.\n\nThe main plant formations are those of shrubs of Erica, strawberry tree, Genisteae, mastic, Mediterranean buckthorn, myrtus and Phoenician juniper; On Elba and Capraia the cork oak is present, while the Aleppo pine and the maritime pine are widely spread on Elba and Gorgona.\n\nThe endemic species of the archipelago are \"Centaurea aetalieae\" (eastern Elba), \"Centaurea gymnocarpa\" (Capraia), \"Centaurea ilvensis\" (western Elba), \"Crocus ilvensis\" (western Elba), \"Limonium doriae\" (Formica Grande), \"Limonium gorgonae\" (Gorgona), \"Limonium ilvae\" (Elba), \"Limonium planesiae\" (Pianosa), \"Limonium sommerierianum\" (Giglio, Giannutri and Montecristo), \"Linaria capraria\" (all main islands except for Giannutri), \"Romulea insularis\" (Capraia) and \"Silene capraria\" (Capraia). Endemic taxa of lower rank are \"Biscutella pichiana\" subsp. \"ilvensis\" (Elba), \"Festuca gamisansii\" subsp. \"aethaliae\" (Elba), \"Mentha requienii\" subsp. \"bistaminata\" (Montecristo and Capraia) and \"Viola corsica\" subsp. \"ilvensis\" (Elba).\n\nElba is a Mediterranean island in Tuscany, Italy, from the coastal town of Piombino. The largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago, Elba is also part of the Arcipelago Toscano National Park and the third largest island in Italy, after Sicily and Sardinia. It is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea, about east of the French island of Corsica.\n\nIsola del Giglio is an Italian island and comune situated in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the coast of Tuscany, and is part of the Province of Grosseto. The island is one of seven that form the Tuscan Archipelago, lying within the Arcipelago Toscano National Park. \"Giglio\" means \"lily\" in Italian, and though the name would appear consistent with the insignia of Medici Florence, it derives from \"Aegilium\", \"Goat Island\", a Latin transliteration of the Greek word for \"little goat\" (Ancient greek: \"Aigýllion\", \"Αιγύλλιον\").\n\nCapraia is an Italian island, is the north-westernmost of the seven islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, and the third largest after Elba and Giglio; it is also a \"comune\" (municipality) belonging to the Province of Livorno. The island has a population of about 400.\n\nMontecristo is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea and part of the Tuscan Archipelago. Administratively it belongs to the municipality of Portoferraio in the province of Livorno, Italy. The island has an area of and is approximately wide at its widest point; the coasts are steep, and extend for . The island is a state nature reserve and forms part of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park.\n\nThe small island of Pianosa, about in area, has a coastal perimeter of , forms part of Italy's Tuscan Archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nGorgona is the northernmost island in the Tuscan Archipelago. Between Corsica and Livorno, this diminutive island has been valued most for its wildlife, especially marine birds, and its isolation. The latter quality resulted in the foundation of Gorgona Abbey in the Middle Ages. After its closure, the monastery grounds and buildings were appropriated in 1869, at the foundation of an agricultural penal colony, which is currently in use.\n\nGiannutri is a small island in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the coast of Tuscany, Italy; it is the southernmost island of the Tuscan Archipelago and it is a \"frazione\" of the \"comune\" of Isola del Giglio in the Province of Grosseto.\n\nThe Formiche di Grosseto (\"Ants of Grosseto\") is a group of islets which emerge sharply in the Tuscan Archipelago. They are located in open sea among the coast of the Natural Park of Maremma and Pianosa, approximately from Porto Santo Stefano on Monte Argentario and from Marina di Grosseto; they are part of the \"comune\" of Grosseto and are placed in a nature reserve which makes part of a special protection area.\n\nPalmaiola is an islet placed in the middle of Piombino Channel, at from Elba and from Piombino; it is part of the comune of Rio Marina.\n\nMeloria is a rocky skerry, surrounded by a shoal, off the Tuscan coast, in the Ligurian sea, north-west of Livorno.\n\nScoglietto di Portoferraio is a rocky skerry without vegetation placed in front of Portoferraio. It is a marine protected area since 1971, and from January 2014 it is a Site of Community Importance. The skerry is long and wide and it is placed at from \"Punta Capo Bianco\" and from \"Punta Falconaia\". On the islet is an active lighthouse.\n\nScoglio d'Africa (or Scoglio d'Affrica), also named Formica di Monte Cristo (\"Monte Cristo's Ant\"), is a solitary small skerry belonging to the Tuscan Archipelago located in open sea between Tyrrhenian Sea and Corsica Channel. It is located west of the Island of Montecristo, south of Pianosa Island and east of Corsica. Administratively it belongs to the municipality of Campo nell'Elba. It is also part of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park.\n\n\n"}

Its author, Aleister Crowley, described it as \"the Word of the Aeon, which signifieth The Great Work accomplished.\" This is in reference to his belief that the writing of \"Liber Legis\" (another name for \"The Book of the Law\") heralded a new Aeon for mankind that was ruled by the god Ra-Hoor-Khuit (a form of Horus). Abrahadabra is, therefore, the \"magical formula\" of this new age. It is not to be confused with the Word of the Law of the Aeon, which is \"Thelema\", meaning \"Will\".\n\nCrowley replaced the 'C' in \"Abracadabra\" with an 'H', which the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in their Neophyte ritual linked with Breath and Life as well as with the god Horus. Aleister Crowley had taken the place of Horus or the Hierus officer in the Golden Dawn's Neophyte ritual, which means that he personally gave the response explaining the meaning of the letter 'H'.\n\nCrowley explains in his essay \"Gematria\" that he changed the magick word to include 'H' because of qabalistic methods. He appears to say that this happened before his January 1901 meeting with Oscar Eckenstein, one of his teachers. At this meeting, Eckenstein ordered Crowley to put aside magick for the moment, and to practice meditation or concentration. In \"Gematria\", Crowley says he took great interest in Abrahadabra, and its qabalistic number 418, at the time someone ordered him to \"abandon the study of magic and the Qabalah\". In the Book of Thoth, Crowley refers to Abrahadabra as a 'cypher' of the Great Work.\n\nThe word \"Abrahadabra\" appears repeatedly in the 1904 invocation of Horus that preceded the writing of \"Liber Legis\" and led to the founding of Thelema. It also appears in a May 1901 diary that Crowley published in \"The Equinox\".\n\nThe essay \"Gematria\" gives Hindu, Christian, and \"Unsectarian\" versions of the problem that Crowley intended this magick word to answer. He also gives a qabalistic equivalent for each phrasing, and a brief symbolic answer for each. The unsectarian version reads, \"I am the finite square; I wish to be one with the infinite circle.\" Its equivalent refers to \"the Cross of Extension\" and \"the infinite Rose.\" Crowley's numerological explanation of \"ABRAHADABRA\" focuses mainly on this last formulation and the answer to it.\n\n\"Abrahadabra\" is also referred to as the \"Word of Double Power\". More specifically, it represents the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm—represented by the pentagram and the hexagram, the rose and the cross, the circle and the square, the 5 and the 6 (etc.), as also called the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of one's Holy Guardian Angel. In \"Commentaries\" (1996), Crowley says that the word is a symbol of the \"establishment of the pillar or phallus of the Macrocosm...in the void of the Microcosm.\"\n\nAs with most things found in the mystical works of Aleister Crowley, the word \"Abrahadabra\" can be examined using the qabalistic method of gematria, which is a form of numerology, whereby correspondences are made based on numerical values.\n\n\nWhere AbraCadabra means “I create as I speak”, abraHaDabra, roughly speaking, means “I create the speech”, in Aramaic.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863612", "title": "Normal-form game", "text": "Normal-form game\n\nIn game theory, normal form is a description of a \"game\". Unlike extensive form, normal-form representations are not graphical \"per se\", but rather represent the game by way of a matrix. While this approach can be of greater use in identifying strictly dominated strategies and Nash equilibria, some information is lost as compared to extensive-form representations. The normal-form representation of a game includes all perceptible and conceivable strategies, and their corresponding payoffs, for each player.\n\nIn static games of complete, perfect information, a normal-form representation of a game is a specification of players' strategy spaces and payoff functions. A strategy space for a player is the set of all strategies available to that player, whereas a strategy is a complete plan of action for every stage of the game, regardless of whether that stage actually arises in play. A payoff function for a player is a mapping from the cross-product of players' strategy spaces to that player's set of payoffs (normally the set of real numbers, where the number represents a cardinal or ordinal utility—often cardinal in the normal-form representation) of a player, i.e. the payoff function of a player takes as its input a strategy profile (that is a specification of strategies for every player) and yields a representation of payoff as its output.\n\nThe matrix provided is a normal-form representation of a game in which players move simultaneously (or at least do not observe the other player's move before making their own) and receive the payoffs as specified for the combinations of actions played. For example, if player 1 plays top and player 2 plays left, player 1 receives 4 and player 2 receives 3. In each cell, the first number represents the payoff to the row player (in this case player 1), and the second number represents the payoff to the column player (in this case player 2).\n\nOften, symmetric games (where the payoffs do not depend on which player chooses each action) are represented with only one payoff. This is the payoff for the row player. For example, the payoff matrices on the right and left below represent the same game.\n\nThe topological space of games with related payoff matrices can also be mapped, with adjacent games having the most similar matrices. This shows how incremental incentive changes can change the game.\n\nThe payoff matrix facilitates elimination of dominated strategies, and it is usually used to illustrate this concept. For example, in the prisoner's dilemma, we can see that each prisoner can either \"cooperate\" or \"defect\". If exactly one prisoner defects, he gets off easily and the other prisoner is locked up for a long time. However, if they both defect, they will both be locked up for a shorter time. One can determine that \"Cooperate\" is strictly dominated by \"Defect\". One must compare the first numbers in each column, in this case 0 > −1 and −2 > −5. This shows that no matter what the column player chooses, the row player does better by choosing \"Defect\". Similarly, one compares the second payoff in each row; again 0 > −1 and −2 > −5. This shows that no matter what row does, column does better by choosing \"Defect\". This demonstrates the unique Nash equilibrium of this game is (\"Defect\", \"Defect\").\n\nThese matrices only represent games in which moves are simultaneous (or, more generally, information is imperfect). The above matrix does not represent the game in which player 1 moves first, observed by player 2, and then player 2 moves, because it does not specify each of player 2's strategies in this case. In order to represent this sequential game we must specify all of player 2's actions, even in contingencies that can never arise in the course of the game. In this game, player 2 has actions, as before, \"Left\" and \"Right\". Unlike before he has four strategies, contingent on player 1's actions. The strategies are:\nOn the right is the normal-form representation of this game.\n\nIn order for a game to be in normal form, we are provided with the following data:\n\n\nA is an association of strategies to players, that is an \"m\"-tuple\n\nsuch that\n\nA is a function\n\nwhose intended interpretation is the award given to a single player at the outcome of the game. Accordingly, to completely specify a game, the payoff function has to be specified for each player in the player set \"P\"= {1, 2, ..., \"m\"}.\n\nDefinition: A \"game in normal form\" is a structure\n\nwhere:\n\nis a set of players,\n\nis an \"m\"-tuple of pure strategy sets, one for each player, and\n\nis an \"m\"-tuple of payoff functions.\n\n"}

It was released in 1970 on Charisma Records.\n\nThe band recorded the album in several stages throughout mid-1970 in Trident Studios with producer John Anthony. The songs mentioned a killer shark in \"Killer\", lost love in \"Lost\" and science fiction material in \"Pioneers Over c\". Bassist Nic Potter left the group in August partway through recording, with organist Hugh Banton covering on bass guitar in the studio and playing bass pedals in concert. King Crimson's Robert Fripp made a guest appearance on guitar, and the cover was the first of several by the band to feature the artwork of Paul Whitehead.\n\nThe album did not chart in the UK, and contemporary reviews were mixed, but it has since been regarded as a good example of progressive rock albums by critics. \"Killer\" has been singled out for praise as a fan favourite.\n\nThe group's previous album, \"The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other\" (February 1970) had achieved a small amount of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film \"Eyewitness\", but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from \"Melody Maker\"s Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.\n\nThe first song to be attempted was \"Killer\", which came out of a rehearsal that attempted to join fragments of songs together in a deliberate attempt to create something that would be commercially successful. The track was a composite of a basic song structure written by group leader Peter Hammill in 1968, an old song written by founding member Judge Smith called \"A Cloud as Big as a Man's Hand\", and a rock riff composed by organist Hugh Banton that he later said was influenced by The Move's \"Brontosaurus\". The lyrics referred to a shark in the ocean, who becomes lonely through killing everything. \"Killer\" quickly became a live favourite with fans, and the group's signature track.\n\nHammill wrote \"The Emperor in His War Room\" about a tyrant who tortures people indiscriminately but is ultimately haunted by those he has tormented. The music joined together two different sections, a sombre opening and closing combined with a bass-driven rock section in the middle. \"Lost\" was, uncharacteristically for the band, a straightforward song about lost love and the group added several different instrumental sections into the basic structure.\n\"Pioneers Over c\" was co-written by Hammill and saxophonist David Jackson. The song had a strong science fiction element and was about a group of astronauts who managed to travel faster than the speed of light (hence the \"c\" in the title). As a result, they go into a time warp, experiencing a \"living death\" where time passes in a nonlinear fashion, and are unable to return to Earth. The whole band helped with the arrangement, coming up with musical themes to match the lyrical theme of isolation and fear.\n\nThe last track to be written for the album was \"House with No Door\". Hammill wrote the song on piano, which was about someone who had difficulty forming friendships and was unable to have meaningful contact with other people. The song is one of several by Hammill to use a house as a metaphor, which would be revisited in subsequent solo work.\nAs with previous Van der Graaf Generator albums, the band collaborated with producer John Anthony at Trident Studios, who had established a good working relationship with the band. However, recording for \"H to He\" was sporadic, and occurred intermittently between gigs throughout 1970.\n\nHammill wanted King Crimson's guitarist and bandleader Robert Fripp to play on \"The Emperor In His War Room\". Fripp had never played as a session musician at that point, but had enjoyed listening to \"The Least We Can Do ...\" and was persuaded to take part by Anthony. Jackson recalled that Fripp \"set up all of his stuff, put his headphones on, and started searing away.\" Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording. Fripp has subsequently introduced Anthony as \"the guy who gave me my first session\" at events. Fripp would collaborate again with Van der Graaf Generator on their next album, \"Pawn Hearts\", released the following year.\n\nThe group took a break from recording to play several festivals throughout the summer of 1970. In July, they played at the Munich and Aachen Festivals with Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath and Fairport Convention. In August, the group played a show as part of BBC Radio 1's \"In Concert\" series, which included \"Killer\", and performed at the 10th National Jazz and Blues Festival at Plumpton on 9 August.\n\nImmediately after the show, bassist Nic Potter quit the band, before the album was completed (he played on the already recorded tracks \"Killer\", \"The Emperor in His War Room\" and \"Lost\"). The group quickly auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz who knew Van der Graaf Generator socially, but the group struggled during rehearsals to form a cohesive sound. As an alternative, Banton, who had a background in classical and church organ music, suggested he could simply play all the bass parts on bass pedals instead, purchasing a Hammond organ to augment his existing Farfisa. Anderson was retained as a roadie. To further expand the sound, Jackson started working with electric saxophones, playing them through effects boxes including a wah-wah.\n\nBanton decided to play bass guitar as well as organ for the remaining studio sessions, being familiar with the instrument. \"Pioneers Over c\" was recorded in sections in the studio, then edited together, making it impossible to perform live in concert. Banton used an oscillator as a musical device to complement that track's lyrical theme. By contrast, \"House with No Door\" was mostly put down live. The group found the sessions enjoyable despite some of the downbeat themes present on the album, and all found fun in some of the esoteric sounds they were creating.\n\nTo promote the album, the band went on Charisma's \"Six Bob Tour\" with Genesis and Lindisfarne. As Van der Graaf Generator had been signed to Charisma the longest, they were the headline act.\n\nThe cover was drawn by Paul Whitehead, and was inspired by \"Pioneers Over c\". The front cover was a painting he had already completed, called \"Birthday\", which showed a beam of light focusing on London, illustrating Whitehead's birth. The inner gatefold picture was called \"Checkmate\". \"H to He\" in the title refers to the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form helium nuclei, a basic exothermic reaction between the sun and stars.\n\nThe first U.S. issue of the album was on the Dunhill Records division of ABC Records. It featured a revised cover with a white background instead of purple. The mid-priced \"Charisma Classics\" re-issue from the early 1980s had a blue cover. A re-mastered version of this album added bonus tracks and was released in 2005. One of the additions is a studio version of \"Squid / Octopus\", a song that had been a staple of early Van der Graaf Generator concerts.\n\nWhitehead would go on to draw several other covers for the band, and for other Charisma artists, including Genesis. He became something of a \"house artist\" for the label in the early 1970s.\n\nThe album was released in December 1970, but did not sell as well as \"The Least We Can Do\", and did not reach the album charts in the UK. Charisma hoped the group could produce another single like \"Refugees\", released earlier in the year. There was some interest in releasing \"Killer\" as a single, but the band rejected this as they might have been pigeonholed as a hard rock band. The group felt there was some conflict of interest by having Tony Stratton-Smith both as manager and record company owner.\n\nContemporary reviews of the album were mainly positive to mixed. \"Melody Maker\" praised \"the brilliance of the songs\", \"Sounds\" enjoyed Jackson's sax playing, and \"Record Mirror\" thought the band would be \"one of the groups most likely to succeed in 1971\". \"Disc & Music Echo\" were less favourable, complaining that the group's sound was \"distinctive but somehow mainly boring\".\n\nRetrospective reviews have been positive. In 2000, \"Q Magazine\" listed the album as one of the best progressive rock albums of all time, saying \"texturally, they were unmistakable. No guitars, just thick dark layers of organ and saxophone.\" AllMusic's Mike DeGagne rated the album 4 out of 5, noting that \"the brooding tones of synthesizer and oscillator along with Peter Hammill's distinct and overly ominous voice make it one of this British band's best efforts.\" Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson and Blur's Graham Coxon have both spoken favourably about the album.\n\nTaken from the sleeve notes\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

He had by then hurriedly published an \"abstract\" of this work as \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, and following the immediate reaction to Darwin's theory his earlier work included demonstrating the utility of the flowers of Orchids in directing insect pollination to achieve cross fertilisation, and a summing up of thirteen years of experiments in \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication\" which went on sale on 30 January 1868. He now published his ideas on human evolution and on how beautiful but apparently impractical features could have evolved in \"The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex\". After revising \"The Origin of Species\" as the definitive 6th edition, his major works on species culminated in \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\". This period was followed by extensive work on insectivorous plants and research into worms.\n\nDespite Darwin's concerns that his children were weakened as his wife Emma Darwin was his cousin or had inherited his own illness, around early 1868 his sons had successes with William Darwin doing well as a bank manager, Leonard Darwin coming second in the entrance exam for the Royal Military Academy and George coming runner-up in his mathematics degree class at the University of Cambridge, getting offered a science mastership at Eton College but choosing to make his career in law.\n\nDarwin turned his attention to sexual selection, writing to scientist friends for information. He got commercial breeders to experiment with altering the appearance of their stock and recording the subject's sexual prowess. He thought that exotic creatures like hummingbirds and peacocks owed their appearance, not to divine design to please man, but to the cumulative effect of the female preferring minute differences in choosing a mate, writing that \"A girl sees a handsome man, and without observing whether his nose or whiskers are the tenth of an inch longer or shorter than in some other man, admires his appearance and says she will marry him. So, I suppose, with the pea-hen.\"\n\nTo meet a lack of books supporting the \"Origin\" on natural selection, Darwin arranged with John Murray to publish a translation of \"Für Darwin\", written by Fritz Müller exiled in Brazil. Darwin provided £100 subsidy and arranged the translator, and \"Facts and Arguments for Darwin\". sold well.\n\nIn the spring of 1868 Darwin got information on newts from St George Mivart, a brilliant anatomist and one of Huxley's protégés who had dropped law for zoology after hearing Owen lecture. He assured Darwin that \"As to \"natural selection\" I accepted it completely\" but added that he had \"doubts & difficulties.. first excited by attending Prof. Huxley's lectures\".\n\nThe book \"The Reign of Law\" by the Duke of Argyll argued that beauty with no obvious utility, such as exotic birds' plumage, proved divine design. Darwin had to show how this was explained by his theory of sexual selection, and was now working to include this with ape ancestry and evolution of morality and religion in a new book which he now decided to call \"The Descent of Man\".\n\nDarwin found many ideas in the quality magazines. Wallace argued that group co-operation increased fitness for survival. Darwin's cousin Francis Galton wrote \"Hereditary Talent and Character\" for \"Macmillan's Magazine\" emphasising the inheritance of traits, and their extension to races and classes, and calling for better breeding to ensure that the \"nobler varieties of mankind\" prevailed, with civilisation being saved from \"intellectual anarchy\" by scientific \"master minds\" rising to power. These views were shared by Darwin's old friend W. R. Greg whose \"Fraser's Magazine\" article about natural selection in society raised fears of the \"unfit\" and of the prudent middle classes being out-bred by the idle rich and the feckless poor.\n\nThese ideas raised a dilemma, of evolution working against progress. Darwin found help in Walter Bagehot's essays on \"Physics and Politics\" in the \"Fortnightly Review\" which argued that progress depended on the command structure of society. Civilisation came from obedience, respect for law and a \"military bond\". Through tribal and imperial battles new racial and national types would emerge, selected as \"The characters which do win in war are the characters which we should wish to win in war\". Darwin added his comment \"nations which wander & cross would be most likely to vary\" in the face of wider competition, and commended to Hooker Bagehot's analysis of \"prehistoric politics\".\n\nHooker became the first Darwinian to become president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. While Hooker was working on his initial address, Darwin with his wife Emma and daughter Henrietta went on holiday to the Isle of Wight on 16 July 1868, and rented a cottage from the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron who took Darwin's portrait. Hooker joined them and the Irish poet William Allingham described \"Dr. Hooker in lower room writing away at his Address... Upstairs Mrs. Darwin, Miss D. and Mr. Charles Darwin himself–, yellow, sickly, very quiet. He has his meals at his own times, sees people or not as he chooses, has invalid's privileges in full, a great help to a studious man.\"\n\nHooker's address to the Norwich British Association was a great success for the X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary \"new reformation\" in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, John Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode). Darwin arrived home on 21 August with a clutch of the day's newspapers carrying the address and editorial comments. \"The Guardian\" said Darwinism's \"reign was triumphant\", and it was generally said that the disciples were \"ready to push their consequences more fearlessly than the master himself\". Darwin enjoyed John Tyndall's lecture in which the physicist widened the application of his theory.\n\nErnst Haeckel's \"Darwinismus\" was even more universal, incorporating life, mind, society, politics and knowledge itself, though Darwin had struggled with reading his book and his efforts to get it translated were thwarted as the book proved too controversial. Haeckel, the \"indomitable worker\", quickly produced his \"History of Creation\". An impressed Huxley adopted Haeckel's approach, and did what he had told Darwin was impossible and wrong, drawing up a genealogical tree for the ancestry of partridges and pigeons which traced them back to the dinosaurs. Huxley also arranged audiences for Germans arriving to pay their \"devotions at the shrine of Mr. Darwin\".\n\nThat autumn, the botanist Asa Gray came to England with his wife for a long rest from \"drudgery\" at Harvard. He spent the time with Hooker at Kew, visiting the Darwins at weekends. There were many other visitors at this time, including Gray's friend Charles Eliot Norton who brought his wife and her sister Sara Sedgwick, who caught William Darwin's eye. Gray was theologically uncomfortable with the implications of \"Variation\", and returned home wanting to avoid further \"Darwinian discussions\" or become \"mixed up\" with the Huxley set.\n\nEver since moving to Downe, Darwin had supported the parish church's work and had been a friend of the Revd. John Innes since he had taken over in 1846. Darwin continued to help, though he stopped attending church after his daughter Annie died in 1851. By 1864 Innes had retired to a property he had inherited in the Scottish Highlands, changing his name to Brodie Innes and leaving the parish in the dubious hands of his curate, the Revd. Stevens, while still remaining the patron. The meagre \"living\" and lack of a vicarage made it hard to attract a priest of quality. Innes made Darwin treasurer of Downe village school and they continued to correspond, with Innes seeking help and advice on parish matters. The Revd. Stevens proved lax, and departed in 1867. His successors were worse, one absconding with the school's funds after Darwin mistakenly shared the treasurer's duties with him. The next was rumoured to have disgraced himself by \"walking with girls at night\". Darwin now became involved in helping Innes with detective work, subsequently advising him that the gossip that had reached Innes was not backed up by any reliable evidence.\n\nConcerned about Thomson's calculations giving a young age for the earth, Darwin asked his mathematical son George to check the figures, disbelieving the \"brevity of the world... else my views would be wrong, which is impossible – Q.E.D.\". Darwin modified the 5th edition of the \"Origin\", speeding up the process of variation and reviving the Lamarckian \"useful inheritance\" notion. In February 1869 Huxley at the Geological Society argued that '\" Biology takes her time from geology...[even] if the geological clock is wrong, all the naturalist will have to do is to modify his notions of the rapidity of change accordingly\".\n\nHuxley was charged with heresy after giving a Sunday \"lay sermon\" in Edinburgh \"on the physical basis of life\". In April the \"Metaphysical Society\", a group of liberal churchmen of all denominations and even atheists, attempted to reach a consensus and Huxley coined a new label for his position – agnostic. Wallace was now arguing that human brains were an over-endowment created by \"spiritual forces\" rather than natural selection, leading Darwin to write \"I differ grievously from you, and I am very sorry for it\".\n\nMivart gained his Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 June with Huxley's help, then surprised him by announcing that he was going to publish his objections to Darwinian views of human nature and morality. Mivart placed anonymous articles criticising natural selection in the Catholic \"Month\". The Duke of Argyll published his \"Primeval Man\" arguing that man could not rise unaided from \"utter barbarism\", and that \"savages\" were degenerates forced out by fitter races. Argyll claimed that \"Man must have had the human proportions of mind before he could afford to lose bestial proportions of body\", contrasting a gorilla with an elder of the British Association, but Darwin noted that without remains of ancestors there was no evidence for this, and that man's vulnerability would have encouraged social cohesion and moral sense.\n\nOn 10 June \"his ladies\" took Darwin away on holiday to Caerdon in the Barmouth valley, but he was depressed to be barely able to walk half a mile. On one walk the feminist Frances Power Cobbe caught up with him and tried to persuade him that John Stuart Mill's book \"The Subjection of Women\" was an ideal source for his study of man's origins and sexual selection. When Darwin, who had read Cobbe's review of Mill, answered that Mill '\"could learn some things\" from biology, and that the \"struggle for existence\" produced man's special \"vigour and courage\" from battling \"for the possession of women\", she offered him a copy of Kant on the \"moral sense\" to sort out his ethical problems, but he declined. He did ask his son William to read Mill and tell him what to think. On 16 July, Darwin started to work out a strategy to \"trump\" Cobbe, and wrote down his notes that men were superior to women because they had been \"defending the tribe & hunting\" for many generations and that Mill didn't think of sexual selection. When he returned home, Darwin added his notes to \"Descent\", commenting that women seemed to show \"greater tenderness and less selfishness\", suggesting that this came from maternal instincts in contrast to male competitiveness. He wrote that \"It is generally admitted that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man; but some, at least, of these faculties are characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation.\" His views supported Victorian stereotypes.\n\nIn November the founding of \"Nature\" gave the X Club an outlet for their views. As well as Hooker and Huxley, it featured Darwin's cousin Francis Galton.\n\nDarwin continued to slog away at the \"Descent of Man\", feeling \"as dull as a duck\". He dreaded publication, telling Mivart that \"I can see that I shall meet with universal disapprobation, if not execution\". As he wrote, he posted chapters to his daughter Henrietta at Cannes, for editing to ensure that damaging inferences could not be drawn. He thought he was getting rather evangelical, writing \"Who would ever have thought I should turn parson!\"\n\nEmma also advised, writing that the treatment of morals and religion might be \"very interesting\", but she would still \"dislike it very much as again putting God further off\". They took a break in mid May 1870 along with Henrietta and Bessy to visit Cambridge where Horace had started and Frank was graduating with a good mathematics degree. Charles was haunted by the absence of \"Dear Henslow\", but on the last day met Sedgwick who was overjoyed to see him with his \"dear family party\". They had a long chat, with Sedgwick not mentioning the \"Origin\", possibly from tact though Darwin thought his brain \"enfeebled\". Late in the day Sedgwick insisted on showing Charles round his new geological museum, by the end of which Darwin was \"utterly prostrated\". As Darwin on struggled to get to the train the next day he remarked on the humiliation of being \"thus killed by a man of eighty-six, who evidently never dreamed that he was thus killing me?\".\n\nThe South American Missionary Society had converted and clothed the natives of Tierra del Fuego that Darwin thought were untameable, and after Bartholomew Sulivan sent a photograph of Jemmy Button's son as evidence, Darwin made donations for several years. Darwin was proud to become an honorary member, but warned Sulivan that he would shortly publish \"another book partly on man, which I dare say many will decry as very wicked\".\n\nDarwin's neighbour Lubbock had been elected Member of Parliament for Maidstone in February 1870 and Darwin lobbied him to get a question added to the census to find if married cousins had as many surviving children as unrelated parents, but when it came up in July, Lubbock's amendment caused furious debate and was heavily defeated. As the Franco-Prussian war got under way, Darwin pressed on to finish the manuscript while worrying about how it would affect his German allies. When the French surrendered at Sedan in November he wrote that \"I have not met a soul in England who does not rejoice in the splendid triumph of Germany over France... It is a most just retribution against that vainglorious, war-liking nation.\" An \"ailing and grumbling\" Darwin worked on with his corrections, and the proofs were sent off on 15 January 1871 with him doubting that the book was \"worth publishing\". He promptly started on his next book, using left over material on emotional expressions.\n\nWithin a week Mivart had published \"On the Genesis of Species\", the cleverest and most devastating critique of natural selection in Darwin's lifetime. Mivart wrote expressing \"sympathy and esteem\" for Darwin, blaming \"irreligious deductions\" on overzealous supporters and adding \"God grant that we in England may not be approaching a religious decay at all similar to that of the middle of the 18th century in France which Frenchmen are now paying for in blood & tears!\" As Paris suffered under siege, Darwin sent out review copies of his book, expecting a backlash.\n\nJust at this point parish affairs intruded. The Revd. Henry Powell had now taken over, but the two previous curates got together to sue Darwin for defamatory remarks about the first absconding with the school's cash. Darwin wrote to Brodie Innes that \"being examined in court could half-kill me, but was assured that the case would never come to court.\n\nThe two 450-page volumes of \"The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex\" went on sale at twenty-four shillings, with a publication date of 24 February 1871. Within three weeks a reprint had been ordered, and 4,500 copies were in print by the end of March 1871, netting Darwin almost £1,500. Darwin's name created demand for the book, but the ideas were old news. \"Everybody is talking about it without being shocked\" which he found \"proof of the increasing liberality of England\". To critics, the book was \"raising a storm of mingled wrath, wonder and admiration\", though they denied that \"spiritual powers\" had evolved from brutes in case earnest men gave up \"those motives by which they have attempted to live noble and virtuous lives\".\n\nThe Prussians had been defeated, but 26 March an insurrection led by socialists and republicans took over Paris and set up the Paris Commune, which was then besieged by French troops. \"The Times\" condemned the Communards, and accused Darwin of undermining authority and principles of morality, opening the way to \"the most murderous revolutions\". A \"man incurs a grave responsibility when, with the authority of a well-earned reputation, he advances at such a time the disintegrating speculations of this book.\" Darwin was able to shrug this off as from a \"windbag full of metaphysics and classics\". When his Tory friend Brodie Innes taunted him that God's scheme, before being thwarted by interfering radicals, was that \"Man was made a man..[split] into niggers who must be made to work [and] better men able to make them\", Darwin responded that \"I consider myself a good way ahead of you, as far as this goes.\"\n\nHe dismissed the objections raised in Wallace's review in the \"Academy\" as \"almost stereotyped\", but to his brother Erasmus Alvey Darwin the generous and polite exchanges formed a \"perfectly beautiful\" controversy, and thought that \"In future histories of science the Wallace-Darwin episode will form one of the few bright points.\"\n\nMivart wrote wishing \"with all my heart that we did not differ so widely\", but challenging Darwin to debate the basic metaphysics underlying science, from his Roman Catholic position writing that \"while combatting (as duty compels me to do) positions you adopt, I am not so much combatting you as others to whose view your scientific labours give additional currency.\" Darwin took this personally, feeling that Mivart's \"Genesis of Species\" was \"producing a great effect against Natural Selection, and more especially against me.\" After completing a rough draft of \"Expressions\" in April 1871 he set it aside and turned to revising the \"Origin\" to meet Mivart's arguments and counter the claim that some divine inner force was driving evolution. Darwin told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the 5th edition at fifteen shillings, and he wanted a new cheap edition to make it more widely available.\n\nIn June Edward L. Youmans, over from the United States to seek authors for his \"International Scientific Series\", told Darwin about lecturing on the \"Descent of Man\" to a \"clerical club\" in Brooklyn. Darwin burst out \"What! Clergymen of different denominations all together? How they would fight if you should get them together here!\" He was cheered by a damning analysis of Mivart's \"Genesis of Species\" by Chauncey Wright (one of Gray's students) for the \"North American Review\", and thought of importing it, but Wallace thought it too heavy and obscure.\n\nNext Mivart's anonymous \"Quarterly Review\" article claimed that the \"Descent of Man\" would unsettle \"our half educated classes\" and talked of people doing as they pleased, breaking laws and customs. The author was obvious to a furious Darwin who thought \"I shall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men\". He wrote to ask Wright for permission to reprint his article as a pamphlet, then feeling \"giddy and bad\" was taken by Emma to recuperate at the nearby hamlet of Albury. His head remained \"rocky and wretched\" and for two months he suffered giddiness and inability to work. They returned for Henrietta's marriage after a whirlwind courtship to Richard Litchfield. She departed, leaving behind her fox terrier \"Polly\" who now became Darwin's dog.\n\nMurray sent out copies of Wright's pamphlet in September 1871. Only fourteen sold, but by then Huxley had already written a cutting review of Mivart's book and article. A relieved Darwin told him \"How you do smash Mivart's theology... He may write his worst & he will never mortify me again\". Hooker thought he surely would not be the happier for Mivart's humiliation, but an unrepentant Darwin responded that '\"I am not so good a Christian as you think me, for I did enjoy my revenge\".\n\nIn December Darwin completed extensive revisions of the \"Origin\", using the word \"evolution\" for the first time and adding a new chapter to refute Mivart's guided jumps, tackling the argument of uselessness of part-evolved organs with myriad examples of gradual development or organs changing function. As 1872 began, Mivart politely inflamed the argument again, writing \"wishing you very sincerely a happy new year\" while wanting a disclaimer of the \"fundamental intellectual errors\" in the \"Descent of Man\". This time Darwin ended the correspondence.\n\nDarwin reacted positively to a tract by the American Francis Abbott proposing \"the extinction of faith in the Christian Confession\" and a new humanist \"Free Religion\" for the \"spiritual perfection of the individual and the spiritual unity of the race\". He subscribed to Abbott's weekly \"The Index\" and allowed it to print his endorsement of the tract's \"truths\", \"I admire them from my inmost heart & I agree to almost every word\".\n\nDarwin told Haeckel \"I doubt whether my strength will last for much more serious work. I shall continue to work for as long as I can, but it does not much signify when I stop, as there are so many good men fully as capable, perhaps more capable than myself, of carrying on our work; and of these you rank as the first.\" With \"the little strength left in me\" he reopened his enquiries into earthworms, requesting information from correspondents.\n\nThe 6th edition of \"Origin of Species\" was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 at a price kept down to 7s. 6d. by using minute print, and sales increased from 60 to 250 a month.\n\nThrough the spring Darwin pressed on with \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\", pointing to shared evolution in contrast to Charles Bell's \"Anatomy and Physiology of Expression\" which claimed divinely created muscles to express man's exquisite feelings. Darwin drew on worldwide responses to his questionnaires, hundreds of photographs of actors, babies and \"imbeciles\" in an asylum, as well as his own observations, with particular empathy for the grief following a family death. The proofs, tackled by Henrietta and Leo, needed major revision which made him \"sick of the subject, and myself, and the world\". It was to be one of the first books with photographs, with seven heliotype plates, and Murray warned that this \"would poke a terrible hole in the profits\".\n\nIn May 1872 Darwin became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nWallace wrote in August, enthusing about H. Charlton Bastian's \"The Beginnings of Life\" claiming the spontaneous generation of life, but Darwin told him that \"I have taken up old botanical work, and have given up all theories\". By the end of September he was again near collapse, but Emma arranged three weeks away to rest, which worked well though he was still \"growing old and weak\".\n\nHooker's collections at Kew were threatened with government cuts under Acton Smee Ayrton. The X Club petitioned Gladstone. When Richard Owen was found to be involved, possibly trying to bring Kew under his British Museum, Darwin commented that \"I used to be ashamed of hating him so much, but now I will carefully cherish my hatred & contempt to the last days of my life\". In October Hooker sent sun-dews and Venus fly-traps for Darwin's experiments, then was devastated when his bedridden mother died. In his hot-house Darwin experimented, giving such plants from around the world a variety of foods and poisons, and began writing \"insectivorous Plants\".\n\n\"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\" proved very popular, selling over 5,000 copies, but an exhausted Darwin became a \"confirmed invalid\" and at his brother Eramus's over Christmas 1872 sat drawing up his will.\n\nDarwin recovered and pressed on with several projects. He subsequently tackled a new edition of the \"Descent of Man\", incorporating ideas from Galton and new anecdotes. The manuscript was completed in April 1874, and the new edition was published on 13 November.\n\nDarwin continued his work following this period.\n\n\n"}

The school's history dates to the 1860s when it was begun as an elementary school serving the African-American population under the then-segregated education system. It now serves secondary students (grades 9-12) within the Duval County Public Schools of Duval County, Florida. The school offers special curricula which include Honors courses, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate courses. In 2005, the Advanced Placement Report to the Nation officially recognized Stanton College Preparatory School as the best large size high school for Advanced Placement European History and Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition in the world.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Stanton College Prep was ranked first in \"Newsweek\" magazine's list of the top 1,000 public schools in the United States, and is the only school in the nation to have been in the top 5 every year from 2000-2011. \"US News and World Report\" ranked Stanton at ninth place on its 2008 list of America's Best High Schools. It has frequently ranked first in the US in the number of International Baccalaureate diplomas awarded. Stanton perennially leads the Jacksonville metropolitan area in the number of National Merit Scholarship recipients, and consistently ranks in the top three in the state. The school has been named a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. As of August 2014, Stanton is rated number 12 of the top high schools in the nation by \"US News\" and number 10 by \"Newsweek\".\n\nStanton was called \"one of the premier IB and AP public schools in the country\" by Jay Mathews in his 2005 book \"Supertest: How the International Baccalaureate Can Strengthen Our Schools\". To many students, Stanton is known for its challenging academics and rigorous standards. Most Stanton students attend some form of college after graduation, whether four-year or two-year institutions, local, national, or international. In 2014, the \"Washington Post\" ranked the school as the 4th most challenging high school in the Southern United States.\n\nShortly after the end of the Civil War, a group of African Americans from Jacksonville organized the Education Society, and, in 1868, purchased the property on which the Old Stanton School was built. It was their intent to erect a school to be called the Florida Institute. Financial problems, however, delayed progress on the building until December of that year, when the school was built and incorporated through the aid of the Freedmen's Bureau. This wooden structure was named in honor of Edwin McMasters Stanton, President Abraham Lincoln's second Secretary of War. He was an ardent champion of human rights and an advocate of free school education for Negro boys and girls. It was the second school for black children in the state of Florida (the first, from 1866, was the predecessor of Edward Waters College).\n\nFor a number of years, the Freedmen's Bureau ran the school. Northern white teachers were employed until the county leased the property for the purpose of opening a public school. The first building was destroyed by fire in 1882. Another building constructed the same year was also destroyed by fire on May 3, 1901, a fire that destroyed much of Jacksonville. A new school was constructed in 1902 and remained in operation until 1917.\n\nOriginally the school mascot had been the Blue Devil. Because the school had burned and been rebuilt twice, \"the Phoenix rising from ashes\" would eventually be adopted as a second mascot. Today both mascots are used, with the Blue Devil used as the mascot for sports and other activities, and the Phoenix used as a symbol of the school itself, along with the most current logo, a royal blue Superman \"S\" symbol.\n\nOn May 23, 1914, the Circuit Court of Duval County appointed nine trustees to manage the school and its property. They were Robert B. Archibald, S. H. Hart, A. L. Lewis, J. W. Floyd, W. L. Girardeau, I. L. Purcell, B. C. Vanderhorst, J. E. Spearing, and W.H. H. Styles. Archibaid and Hart resigned and were replaced by J. M. Baker and L. H. Myers.\n\nThe deteriorating and unsafe condition of the poorly-constructed school building prompted the Board of Public Instruction, the Stanton School trustees, and interested citizens of Jacksonville to jointly agree to replace the wooden structure with a fire-proof building. In 1917 the building, which still stands at Ashley, Broad, Beaver, and Clay Streets, was completed. Stanton became the main focus for the education of black children in Duval County and surrounding areas. The Edwin M. Stanton School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nAn equally impressive record of academic expansion has accomplished the physical growth of Stanton. Beginning as an elementary school with six grades, under the administration of J. C. Waters as the first principal and D. W. Gulp who followed as principal, Stanton gradually became known throughout the state for the high educational standards which it still maintains today. The eighth grade was added under the leadership of Principal W. M. Artrell. Principal James Weldon Johnson, an alumnus, started the move toward a high school department. The addition of the twelfth grade made Stanton a comprehensive school.\n\nStanton continued as a school for all grades through the administrations of I. A. Blocker, G. M. Sampson, and J. N. Wilson. In 1938, with F. J. Anderson as principal, Stanton became a senior high school exclusively. J. L. Terry served as the last principal of Stanton Senior High School.\n\nIn 1953, the Stanton Senior School name was transferred to a new facility on 13th Street and was renamed New Stanton Senior High School. Charles D. Brooks was the first principal of the new school. Under his leadership, Stanton continued to foster the same traditionally high standards which befit its rich heritage, and flourished as the oldest and most important high school for blacks in Jacksonville.\n\nBeginning in 1953, the Broad and Ashley Street facility became known as the \"Old\" Stanton. The building was used as a junior high school in 1953-1954. In August 1954, it was converted into the Stanton Vocational High School and functioned as a vocational training center, adjusting its curriculum to train and graduate African-American students in technical skills. At night, it became a center for the Adult and Veterans Education Program.\n\nFrom 1969-1971, the focus of New Stanton Senior High School began to change from academic to vocational under the leadership of Principal Ben Durham, the former principal of Stanton Vocational High School. In 1971, the Old Stanton High School building was again placed under control of the trustees of Stanton and the student body was transferred to New Stanton Senior High School where the revised curriculum now provided for both the academic and the vocational interests of the students\n\nIn 1981, Stanton College Preparatory School became the Duval County School System's first magnet school. Beginning with grades 7-10, and adding one grade level each succeeding year, the first senior class of 54 students graduated in 1984. Stanton College Preparatory School now serves secondary students living within the of the Duval County school district and leads the Duval County Public Schools in academic achievement.\n\nIn March 2017, the school received international criticism for verbiage on flyers hung around campus presenting both acceptable and unacceptable attire for the school prom. Students found the use of \"good girl\" to praise those with attire deemed appropriate to be demeaning, and took to social media with the hashtag #scpgoodgirl. The principal quickly issued an apology.\n\nStanton has many honor societies that support students in multiple fields. Honor societies include:\n\nStanton competes in the Gateway Conference, a collaboration between most public high schools in Duval County. As of the 2018-2019 school year, Stanton's athletic director is Christopher Crider. Stanton's campus has a limited number of athletic facilities due to its urban environment, but includes a football field, a rubber track, a softball field, and two hard surface tennis courts. Because Stanton doesn't have a baseball field, the baseball team practices at J. P. Small Memorial Stadium. Similarly, Stanton's cross country and track & field teams used to practice at Mallison Park before Stanton's rubber track was built. Stanton's sports include cross country, basketball, football, wrestling, weightlifting, flag football, soccer, track and field, swimming and diving, lacrosse, bowling, volleyball, tennis, baseball, softball, golf, and competitive cheerleading.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863662", "title": "Gisenyi", "text": "Gisenyi\n\nGisenyi is a city in Rubavu district in Rwanda's Western Province. Gisenyi is contiguous with Goma, the city across the border in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe city features a resort on the shores of Lake Kivu, with several hotels and three sandy beaches. The area is also known for water sports. The northern shore of the lake on which Goma and Gisenyi lie is a flat plain featuring lava formations from the eruptions of nearby Mount Nyiragongo.\n\nIn contrast to Goma, Gisenyi escaped the lava flows of both the 1977 and the 2002 eruptions, which destroyed between 15 and 40% of the former. The centre of Gisenyi lies by foothills at the northeast corner of the lake, and low-density expansion is taking place in the hills, which are expected to be safe from future eruptions.\nGisenyi is also home to Bralirwa, the only brewery in Rwanda, which manufactures various local beers — Primus, Mützig, Amstel and Guinness — as well as a range of Coca-Cola–branded soft drinks. Gisenyi is a small town compared to neighbouring Goma in the DRC, though Gisenyi is growing quickly. In 2011, a new multistorey shopping mall began construction over an old bus station. As of 2011, the main roads of the town are paved, and sidewalks are nearing completion for most of them as well.\n\nGisenyi has two borders with Goma, the \"Petite Barrière\" and the \"Grand Barrière\". These names are a little misleading because the Petite Barrière is physically larger and features much higher traffic volumes. About 6,000 people crossed the Petite Barrière daily during 2011. On the Gisenyi side, a large customs and immigration office was built with a large capacity, not yet matched by the Congolese facilities. Similarly, the road to the Petite Barrière is paved on the Rwandan side but not on the Congolese side. The Grande Barrière is paved on both sides and receives more of the heavy truck traffic. It is also a diplomatic border.\n\nDuring the Rwandan genocide, the provisional government was based in the city. Gisenyi is the city where Laurent Nkunda — accused by the United Nations of having led an army that illegally recruited Congolese child soldiers — is being held, pending a determination on the DRC's extradition request.\n\nGisenyi's campus of Kigali Independent University had an enrolment of 3413 students in the 2012-2013 academic year. The students were pursuing programs in the faculties of Economics and Business Studies, Social Sciences, and Law. Rwanda Tourism University College (RTUC) also has a Gisenyi campus. The town has about 30 public and private schools, including nursery, primary and secondary schools.\n"}

The transient flow of groundwater is described by a form of the diffusion equation, similar to that used in heat transfer to describe the flow of heat in a solid (heat conduction). The steady-state flow of groundwater is described by a form of the Laplace equation, which is a form of potential flow and has analogs in numerous fields.\n\nThe groundwater flow equation is often derived for a small representative elemental volume (REV), where the properties of the medium are assumed to be effectively constant. A mass balance is done on the water flowing in and out of this small volume, the flux terms in the relationship being expressed in terms of head by using the constituitive equation called Darcy's law, which requires that the flow is laminar. Other approaches are based on Agent Based Models to incorporate the effect of complex aquifers such as karstic or fractured rocks (i.e. volcanic) \n\nA mass balance must be performed, and used along with Darcy's law, to arrive at the transient groundwater flow equation. This balance is analogous to the energy balance used in heat transfer to arrive at the heat equation. It is simply a statement of accounting, that for a given control volume, aside from sources or sinks, mass cannot be created or destroyed. The conservation of mass states that, for a given increment of time (\"Δt\"), the difference between the mass flowing in across the boundaries, the mass flowing out across the boundaries, and the sources within the volume, is the change in storage.\n\nMass can be represented as density times volume, and under most conditions, water can be considered incompressible (density does not depend on pressure). The mass fluxes across the boundaries then become volume fluxes (as are found in Darcy's law). Using Taylor series to represent the in and out flux terms across the boundaries of the control volume, and using the divergence theorem to turn the flux across the boundary into a flux over the entire volume, the final form of the groundwater flow equation (in differential form) is:\n\nThis is known in other fields as the diffusion equation or heat equation, it is a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). This mathematical statement indicates that the change in hydraulic head with time (left hand side) equals the negative divergence of the flux (\"q\") and the source terms (\"G\"). This equation has both head and flux as unknowns, but Darcy's law relates flux to hydraulic heads, so substituting it in for the flux (\"q\") leads to\n\nNow if hydraulic conductivity (\"K\") is spatially uniform and isotropic (rather than a tensor), it can be taken out of the spatial derivative, simplifying them to the Laplacian, this makes the equation\n\nDividing through by the specific storage (\"S\"), puts hydraulic diffusivity (\"α\" = \"K/S\" or equivalently, \"α\" = \"T/S\") on the right hand side. The hydraulic diffusivity is proportional to the speed at which a finite pressure pulse will propagate through the system (large values of \"α\" lead to fast propagation of signals). The groundwater flow equation then becomes\n\nWhere the sink/source term, \"G\", now has the same units but is divided by the appropriate storage term (as defined by the hydraulic diffusivity substitution).\n\nEspecially when using rectangular grid finite-difference models (\"e.g.\" MODFLOW, made by the USGS), we deal with Cartesian coordinates. In these coordinates the general Laplacian operator becomes (for three-dimensional flow) specifically\n\nMODFLOW code discretizes and simulates an orthogonal 3-D form of the governing groundwater flow equation. However, it has an option to run in a \"quasi-3D\" mode if the user wishes to do so; in this case the model deals with the vertically averaged \"T\" and \"S\", rather than \"k\" and \"S\". In the quasi-3D mode, flow is calculated between 2D horizontal layers using the concept of leakage.\n\nAnother useful coordinate system is 3D cylindrical coordinates (typically where a pumping well is a line source located at the origin — parallel to the \"z\" axis — causing converging radial flow). Under these conditions the above equation becomes (\"r\" being radial distance and \"θ\" being angle),\n\nThis equation represents flow to a pumping well (a sink of strength \"G\"), located at the origin. Both this equation and the Cartesian version above are the fundamental equation in groundwater flow, but to arrive at this point requires considerable simplification. Some of the main assumptions which went into both these equations are:\n\n\nDespite these large assumptions, the groundwater flow equation does a good job of representing the distribution of heads in aquifers due to a transient distribution of sources and sinks.\n\nIf the aquifer has recharging boundary conditions a steady-state may be reached (or it may be used as an approximation in many cases), and the diffusion equation (above) simplifies to the Laplace equation.\n\nThis equation states that hydraulic head is a harmonic function, and has many analogs in other fields. The Laplace equation can be solved using techniques, using similar assumptions stated above, but with the additional requirements of a steady-state flow field.\n\nA common method for solution of this equations in civil engineering and soil mechanics is to use the graphical technique of drawing flownets; where contour lines of hydraulic head and the stream function make a curvilinear grid, allowing complex geometries to be solved approximately.\n\nSteady-state flow to a pumping well (which never truly occurs, but is sometimes a useful approximation) is commonly called the Thiem solution.\n\nThe above groundwater flow equations are valid for three dimensional flow. In unconfined aquifers, the solution to the 3D form of the equation is complicated by the presence of a free surface water table boundary condition: in addition to solving for the spatial distribution of heads, the location of this surface is also an unknown. This is a non-linear problem, even though the governing equation is linear.\n\nAn alternative formulation of the groundwater flow equation may be obtained by invoking the Dupuit–Forchheimer assumption, where it is assumed that heads do not vary in the vertical direction (i.e., formula_9). A horizontal water balance is applied to a long vertical column with area formula_10 extending from the aquifer base to the unsaturated surface. This distance is referred to as the saturated thickness, \"b\". In a confined aquifer, the saturated thickness is determined by the height of the aquifer, \"H\", and the pressure head is non-zero everywhere. In an unconfined aquifer, the saturated thickness is defined as the vertical distance between the water table surface and the aquifer base. If formula_9, and the aquifer base is at the zero datum, then the unconfined saturated thickness is equal to the head, i.e., \"b=h\".\n\nAssuming both the hydraulic conductivity and the horizontal components of flow are uniform along the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer (i.e., formula_12 and formula_13), we can express Darcy's law in terms of integrated groundwater discharges, \"Q\" and \"Q\":\n\nInserting these into our mass balance expression, we obtain the general 2D governing equation for incompressible saturated groundwater flow:\n\nWhere \"n\" is the aquifer porosity. The source term, \"N\" (length per time), represents the addition of water in the vertical direction (e.g., recharge). By incorporating the correct definitions for saturated thickness, specific storage, and specific yield, we can transform this into two unique governing equations for confined and unconfined conditions:\n\n(confined), where \"S=Sb\" is the aquifer storativity and\n\n(unconfined), where \"S\" is the specific yield of the aquifer.\n\nNote that the partial differential equation in the unconfined case is non-linear, whereas it is linear in the confined case. For unconfined steady-state flow, this non-linearity may be removed by expressing the PDE in terms of the head squared:\n\nOr, for homogeneous aquifers,\n\nThis formulation allows us to apply standard methods for solving linear PDEs in the case of unconfined flow. For heterogeneous aquifers with no recharge, Potential flow methods may be applied for mixed confined/unconfined cases.\n\n\n\n"}

Its thermic effect or specific dynamic action—the caloric \"cost\" of digesting the food—would be greater than its food energy content. Despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides, there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative. While some chilled beverages are calorically negative, the effect is minimal and requires drinking large amounts of water, which can be dangerous, as it can cause water intoxication.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to show that any of these foods have a negative calorific impact. Foods claimed to be negative in calories are mostly low-calorie fruits and vegetables such as celery, grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple, lettuce, broccoli, and cabbage. However, celery has a thermic effect of around 8%, much less than the 100% or more required for a food to have \"negative calories\". \n\nDiets based on negative-calorie food do not work as advertised but can lead to weight loss because they satisfy hunger by filling the stomach with food that is not calorically dense. A 2005 study based on a low-fat plant-based diet found that the average participant lost over fourteen weeks, and attributed the weight loss to the reduced energy density of the foods resulting from their low fat content and high fiber content, and the increased thermic effect. Nevertheless, these diets are not \"negative-calorie\" since they bear energy. Another study demonstrated that negative-calorie diets (NCDs) have the same efficacy to low-calorie diets (LCDs) in inducing weight loss when both of these diets are combined with exercise.\n\nChewing gum was once speculated as \"negative-calorie food,\" however a study on chewing gum reported mastication burns roughly per hour. Therefore, one stick of gum which contains around 10 kcal would require being chewed for one or more hours to reach \"negative-calorie\".\n\n"}

Later on in his career he played for Carlton, Forest Green Rovers, Aberystwyth Town, Weston-super-Mare and Wivenhoe Town.\n\nSlater joined West Ham as an apprentice in 1986 and after a tough first year, he became a star of the youth team. He made his first appearance for West Ham, still an apprentice, when he came on as substitute for Ray Stewart in the Division One home game against Derby County in October 1987. He was offered a professional contract in April 1988 just after his seventeenth birthday and made a second appearance in the 1987–88 season when he came on as substitute in the home game against Coventry City in the same month.\n\nHe made his first start for West Ham against Southampton in August 1988, when a clash of heads with Russell Osman led to him being taken off in the first minute. He recovered to win the Man of the Match award in his next two games, against Charlton and Newcastle United, and scored his first goal for the club in a F.A. Cup 5th round tie against Charlton in February 1989. Playing in Division Two in 1989–90, he scored nine goals in 50 league and cup appearances as West Ham reached the semi-final of the League Cup, and made three substitute appearances for the England Under 21 team in 1990.\n\nManager Billy Bonds switched him to the left wing towards the end of the 1989–90 season where he excelled to the extent that after a 5–0 home defeat of Sheffield United in March 1990, the Sheffield United defender, Chris Wilder, shook Slater's hand, saying, \"\"That's the closest I've been to you all evening.\"\" A similar performance came against Everton in the sixth-round of the FA Cup in March 1991, when he also scored West Ham's second goal from 20 yards, as West Ham won 2–1 to reach the semi-finals. West Ham returned to Division One in 1991–92 but, troubled by an Achilles injury, Slater failed to score a goal in 51 appearances. He turned down the offer of a new contract and left the club in August 1992 for Celtic.\n\nFormer West Ham teammate, Liam Brady, then manager of Celtic, took Slater to Glasgow in a £1.5 million deal in August 1992. Slater made his debut in the same month, coming on as a substitute in a 1–1 away draw against Rangers, but did not make an impression at Celtic and thirteen months later he returned south to Ipswich Town, having scored three goals in 43 appearances.\n\nHe joined Ipswich Town in a £750,000 deal in September 1993, where he linked up again with his former manager at West Ham, John Lyall, in the Premier League. He stayed at Ipswich for three seasons scoring four goals in 84 appearances before leaving on a free transfer.\n\nAfter a short spell on trial at Leicester City, Slater joined Watford. Injuries limited him to only 35 league appearances for the Watford in almost three years and he eventually moved to Australia, joining NSL club, Carlton S.C., in August 1999.\n\nSlater returned to England a year later to join Football Conference club Forest Green Rovers in October 2000, for whom he made 24 league and cup appearances in the 2000–01 season and played in the FA Trophy final at Villa Park in May 2001, when Rovers were beaten 1–0 by Canvey Island.\n\nHe was unable to agree a new contract with Rovers and followed manager Frank Gregan to League of Wales side Aberystwyth Town in July 2001. Poor results in the first months of the 2001–02 season saw Frank Gregan depart and Slater follow him to Southern League club, Weston-super-Mare, in December 2001, where he stayed for the next three years, helping Weston-super-Mare to promotion to the Southern League Premier Division in 2003.\n\nHe played his final game for Weston-super-Mare in a 1–1 draw, in which he scored, at Bishop Stortford in October 2004. In January 2009, Slater joined Wivenhoe Town, managed by his former West Ham teammate, Julian Dicks, but never made an appearance for the team.\n\nSlater became football coach having achieved the UEFA 'B' licence and has been a coach/manager at the Youth Academy of West Ham United and remains a club ambassador at 1st team games to this day. He also has many years experience as a secondary school P.E. Teacher at Kings Langley School.\n\nSlater later oversaw a full-time squad of under-19 Apprentices at Chelmsford City along with former Southend United and Colchester United player Kirk Game. The club has partnered Chelmsford College and formed a football programme called SOCA (Soccer Opportunities and Coaching Academy) that helps develop talented young footballers and coaches, giving them a chance to develop their skills at recognised clubs and organisations whilst also gaining top coaching and educational qualifications.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n"}

He brought academic rigour to an area that had been marked by nationalistic and religious biases. His work was part of the marked changes to Quebec society during the Quiet Revolution. Trudel's work has been honoured with major awards, including the Governor General's Literary Award for French Non-Fiction in 1966, and a second nomination for the award in 1987.\n\nMarcel Trudel was born in Saint-Narcisse-de-Champlain, Quebec, northeast of Trois-Rivières, the son of Hermyle Trudel and Antoinette Cossette, the ninth of eleven children. Orphaned at the age of five, he was adopted by a local couple in his extended family, Théodore Baril and Mary Trépanier.\n\nHe showed great academic progress and spent some months at a seminary at Trois-Rivières, but concluded that the priesthood was not for him. Rather, he had a particular interest in literature and hoped to make his living as a writer. He earned a \"licence ès lettres (cum laude)\" in 1941 and a \"Doctorat ès lettres (magna cum laude)\" in 1945, both from Université Laval. He then had two years of post-doctoral studies at Harvard University before returning to Laval to teach history.\n\nIn 1947, Trudeal was the first professor of history in Laval's newly founded Institute of History. He went on to become head of the History department. From 1955 to 1960, he published on many subjects that the Catholic hierarchy controlling the university found scandalous, such as: \"Chiniquy\" (the first French Catholic priest who became a Presbyterian minister), \"The Canadian Catholic Church under the English Military Government, in 1759-1764\", and \"The Slaves in New France\" (most of them being Amerindian and belonging even to the Catholic Church masters). As of 1962, Trudel was also president of the \"For Laïcité Movement\" in Quebec City. It was too much: in 1962, under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church, Laval University demoted him from his position as head of the History department.\n\nIn 1961, Laval University Press joined with the University of Toronto Press in establishing the Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCB). Trudel served as the Associate General Editor from 1961 to 1965, working with the General Editor, George Williams Brown, a historian at the University of Toronto. They collaborated both in organizing the over-all project, which has published 15 volumes and is on-going, and in editing the first volume, which covered the period from 1000-1700 and was published in 1966. The DCB is published simultaneously in English and French and has been widely recognized as one of the most important scholarly undertakings in Canada.\n\nIn 1965, Trudel left Laval University and Quebec City to live near Ottawa and taught at Carleton University. The next year, he began teaching at the University of Ottawa after the Ontario government took over the university from the Catholic Oblate Fathers. Having reached age 65 in 1982, he was relieved of his lecturing duties, but he continued to write from his home near Montreal until the year he died; half of his books were published in retirement. In 1993, he also began lecturing at a university to seniors' groups.\n\nTrudel's life's work was the history of New France, in particular his monumental and authoritative \"Histoire de la Nouvelle-France\". Planned to be ten volumes in collaboration with another Quebec historian, Guy Frégault, Trudel wrote six volumes in the series, published between 1963 to 1999. Trudel meticulously reviewed the primary sources and criticized previous accounts in his effort to tell the colony's story without what he viewed as pious or nationalist bias.\n\nIn 1942, Trudel married Anne Chrétien, with whom he had three children. He married again in 1970, to Micheline D'Allaire, who was also a professor of history at the University of Ottawa.\n\nTrudel died at the age of 93 on January 11, 2011, of generalized cancer. He left his three children, plus six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\n\nTrudel was a prolific author. He worked primarily in French, but some of his works also appeared in English, via translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - French language article on \n\n\n"}

It is part of the Campbell Union High School District, (CUHSD), the other schools in which are Branham, Leigh, Prospect, and Westmont. Most of Del Mar’s students come from the Campbell Union School District’s Monroe Middle School. The school serves both San Jose and Campbell, in addition to some unincorporated pockets of Santa Clara County. In 2016, Del Mar became an International Baccalaureate school. The first class who started the diploma, was the class of 2018.\n\nThe school mascot of Del Mar is \"The Don,\" and the colors are black, gold, and, officially, white. As of 2012 the school principal is Larry Lopez. In recent years, the school's academic scores have risen significantly, most notably by reaching an API (Academic Performance Index) score of 720 in 2011, a jump of 122 points since 2004. In 2007, it was officially deemed a “California Distinguished School.” \n\nThe CUHSD began construction on the Del Mar campus in 1957; it was established in 1959. The first school year began in September 1959 with the first class graduating in June 1960. Del Mar was the first complete four year high school in California to be constructed by the state's aid building fund, at a cost of $3 million. The dedication of the new school was attended by California Governor Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown.\n\nThe school was also the first of any high school in the state to boast a sunken football stadium; the stadium came about as part of an agreement between the school district and Count Allesandro Dandini, the owner of a brick-making plant which was adjacent to the football field. The stadium area was cleared out in exchange for the clay which was excavated. In 2007, the grass field and dirt track were replaced with an artificial turf field and tartan track in time for football season.\n\nThe superintendent of the CUHSD at the time of the school's construction in 1957, Larry Hill, made a deal to get the 'clinker' bricks from the yard at a discount, to use in the schools the district was building at the time. As a result, all of Del Mar's original buildings have a great deal of brick in them.\n\nDel Mar’s main athletic rivals are often Branham, Westmont or Leigh, since they are sister schools in the Campbell Union High School District. This varies between sports and changes from year to year, however.\n\nDel Mar sports teams compete in the Blossom Valley Athletic League, divisions of which are ‘A league’: Mount Hamilton Division, ‘B league’: Santa Teresa Division, and ‘C league’: West Valley Division. BVAL falls in California’s Central Coast Section, known as CCS. The school's sport program includes football, soccer, basketball, cross country, volleyball, field hockey, tennis, golf, wrestling, baseball, softball, badminton, swimming & diving, and track & field.\n\nDel Mar sports teams have won many League and CCS championships over the course of the school's history - the banners commemorating those titles hang in the school's big gym. In the 2005-2006 school year, several teams won the title of League Champions, including football, JV boys' soccer, badminton, and girls' swimming. The 2006-2007 season was no different, as boys' basketball won the league, as did the ladies soccer team, who went on to CCS. In the spring of 2007, the track & field team sent the first relay team to CCS in 10 years, but fell short of winning league to Andrew Hill. Field hockey has won league titles in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009, 2009-2010, 2010-2011. In fall 2007, the football team made history by going 10-0, a feat that has never accomplished in the school's history, and also was able to host the first round of CCS Playoffs at home for the first time in 11 years. In 2007-2008 Del Mar's track team won the League championship going a perfect 7-0 in League. In 2009, the girls basketball team won a school-record 21 games and made it to the second round of CCS playoffs.\n\nDel Mar's Football team won the 2010 league championship with a 7-3 record, which was a huge turn around from the 1-9 record the previous season. Del Mar repeated as the 2011 West Valley Division Football Champs with a league record of 7-3. This was the first time Del Mar won back to back league championships in football since the 90-91 teams.\nDel Mar’s marching band is officially named the Del Mar High School Marching Band. In the fall, they host the annual Feste Del Mar Band Review, which holds competitions for Concert, Jazz, and Marching bands, and is known in the NCBA (Northern California Band Association) circuit for its hospitality. Del Mar routinely sends musicians to the Northern California Honor Band, and the All-State Honor Band. Fall season Marching Band was a class until 2016 when it officially became an extra-curricular sport, rehearsing Tuesday and Thursday nights from 6 to 9 pm and Saturdays from 9 am to 5 pm. Meanwhile, the class became solely dedicated to Symphonic band performance.\n\nIn the winter season, Del Mar fields a WinterGuard and Winter Percussion, which both practice Tuesday and Thursday nights. They have competed as part of CCGC, and NCBA. Del Mar also has a fairly successful Choir class, with plans to travel to Dublin in June 2018. Orchestra has also become an outside-school activity due to low enrollment.\n\nDrama 1 and Drama 2, and occasionally Drama 3, classes are offered at Del Mar. There is a play produced every November and a musical produced every February, as well as a faculty musical every April. All productions are usually directed and produced by the chair of the performing arts department. \n\nPast shows include 'Charlie Brown,' 'Twilight of the Golds,' 'Hamlet II,' ‘The Actor’s Nightmare,’ 'Thoroughly Modern Millie,' ‘Little Shop of Horrors,’ ‘Once Upon a Mattress,’ ‘Aida,’ ‘42nd Street,’ ‘A Funny Thing Happened on the way to the Forum,’ 'Don't Drink the Water,' 'Cinderella,' 'Girl Crazy,' ‘Grease,’ 'Guys & Dolls,' and others. The most recent musical productions have been 'Bells are Ringing' in 2018, 'Into the Woods' in 2017, and 'The Drowsy Chaperone' in 2016. The most recent plays include 'Much Ado About Nothing', 'The Real Inspector Hound', and 'Barefoot in the Park'. \nThe DMHS newspaper is called the \"Perspective\", and is produced by the Journalism class. The \"Perspective\"’s website is www.dmhsperspective.com. The first newspaper at Del Mar, published in 1962, three years after the school opened, was called the \"Excelsior.\" \"The Galleon\" became the name in 1966, and \"The Dawning\" replaced that in 1983. The newspaper assumed its current name in a \"Name the Newspaper\" contest in 1993, although the full original name was \"From the Don's Perspective\". As of August 2011 the newspaper is entirely online with the exception of the printed Senior Magazine. The Perspective has a Facebook page and a Twitter.\n\nThe yearbook class puts together the yearbook, called the Laurel.\n\nDel Mar’s ASB meets at 7:30 in the ASB room every day, and is in charge of organizing activities, rallies, and dances. This includes Spirit Week, before Homecoming, Class Olympics, and assorted dances throughout the year, including Kickoff, Homecoming, Blackout, and Prom. There is an ASB President, VP, Secretary, and Treasurer, and then the same for each grade level. Elections are held near the end of each year for the next year’s officers. An ASB card will get students into various events either for free (sports games), or for a reduced price (dances and performances). They can be purchased with a yearbook at the beginning of the year for around $90.\n\nSeveral of the above-mentioned associations are considered ‘clubs,’ but the list of the more traditional meet-during-lunch clubs on campus includes C.S.F. (California Scholarship Federation), Photo Club, International Club, Key Club, Juventud Latina, GSA (Gay Straight Alliance), Uprising, and Ecology Club. Del Mar also has a Spirit squad.\n\nDel Mar High School does not offer \"Honors\" courses. However, Freshman and Sophomore students can choose to take \"ICAP\" classes. These classes specifically prepare students to IB classes in their Junior and Senior years. Del Mar High School officially became an IB in 2016. Students still have the option of taking AP U.S. Government and Politics, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Calculus AB in addition to the IB courses offered.\nDel Mar operates on a normal A through F system, with minor variation among teachers on which percentages correspond to which letter grades. Progress reports are sent home every six weeks, and final grades at the end of each semester, of which there are two. Finals for the first semester generally fall on or around January 29, and second semester finals are around June 14, with seniors’ generally the week earlier.\n\nDel Mar, along with the rest of the CUHSD, is on a block schedule, with periods 1-3 on Gold days, 4-6 on Black days, zero period every day, and seventh period every day except Wednesday. This gives teachers longer uninterrupted class periods to work with.\n\nFor the 2009-2010 school year, Del Mar's faculty voted on a new class schedule. This schedule would consist of a tutorial period in the middle of the day named \"PLUS PERIOD.\" Furthermore, freshman who are not enrolled in Honors classes will follow a Learning Community program. This is an attempt to remedy past failures in increasing exam scores.\n\nDel Mar also has \"collaboration days\" when seventh period doesn’t meet, and school ends at 1:15. There are also minimum days at the end of each grading period, (every six weeks), when regular classes get out at 12:25, seventh period at 1:00. Finals are given in 120 minute blocks and the day ends at 12:20.\n\nSix classes is a normal course load.\n\nDel Mar, along with the rest of the Campbell Union High School District, is set up for teachers to electronically enter their students’ grades on AERIES, a program that then allows students and parents to check their grades online. Also, Del Mar is on SchoolLoop, a program that allows teachers to post homework assignments, test dates, and notes online, in addition to providing the opportunity to communicate with their students by email.\n\nParent associations/Booster clubs at Del Mar include the Dons Club, PTA, Padres Unidos, and the Performing Arts Association. Membership in the Dons Club includes discounts to get into most athletic events that charge admission.\n\nThe administration/staff for Del Mar High School includes principal Larry Lopez, assistant principals Diana Nguyen, Juan Gonzalez and Lindsay Pebworth, counselors Evelyn Beas, Kristie Geist and Richard Mendoza, activities director Courtney Van Benthuysen, and athletics director Ryan Castaneda. A great number of the teachers at Del Mar have been hired in the last three years. Del Mar has young Staff and Coaches in charge of some of the sports teams and students in charge of the newspaper, and yearbook.\nWest Valley is a popular community college among Del Mar students, and many Del Mar students have gone on to colleges and universities in the UC and CSU systems, as well as private schools such as Santa Clara University, Pacific University, Northwestern, and Stanford.\n\nSeveral school awards are presented at graduation, including the Principal's Cup, the Laurance J. Hill Award, and the titles of valedictorian and salutatorian. Laurance Hill was a principal of the old Campbell High School, and played an important role in the expansion of the CUHSD district. An award in his name is given out to those with good grades and high involvement in school, especially in community service.\n\nDel Mar’s original wings on the north side of the quad, in addition to the band and drama rooms, the cafeteria/stage end of the building, the main office, teacher’s lounge, library, and student services center are all original buildings in Del Mar’s traditional brick. Many of these wings have been refurbished in the past several years, or are in the process of being redone.\nIn what used to be the senior parking lot stands the new science wing, complete with solar panels on the roof that feed back into the power grid, after serving the science wing itself. It contains six classrooms, providing physics, chemistry, biology, and integrated science classes with high ceilings, projectors, and, in room 74, a balcony.\n\nThe large and small gyms, locker rooms, and swimming pool, on the south side of the quad, are also original. The big gym, home to basketball, volleyball, badminton, and several families of small birds which build nests in the old lights in the ceiling, received a new paint job in 2006 courtesy of the Don's Club. The pool deck has two pools, the 12-foot diving well and the 6-lane pool, which is 3.5 feet at the ends and 4 in the middle. Water polo cannot be played at Del Mar because of the pool's depth, or lack thereof. There are seven tennis courts, four outdoor basketball courts, two sand volleyball courts that are rarely used, the weight room, a football practice field, a baseball diamond, three softball/baseball fields, and a large field that houses soccer. There is also the Bowl, housing the brand new artificial-turf athletic field and appropriately new rubber track which is used for field hockey, soccer, and football.\n\nThe Del Mar campus is also home to a Metropolitan Adult Education Program center.\n\nNotable alumni of Del Mar High School include:\n\n\n\n"}

The trophy was built in 1970 and is a replica of a 19th-century Howitzer cannon that accompanied American explorer and politician John C. Frémont on an expedition to the American West and Nevada in the mid 19th century. The original cannon had been abandoned, due to heavy snows, in the Sierra Nevada in 1843. The replica cannon was originally fired following a touchdown by the team in possession of the cannon, it has been inoperable since 1999. The wooden carriage is painted the school color of the team in possession, navy blue for Nevada or scarlet for UNLV. The trophy is the heaviest and most expensive in college football. Since 2012, the game is also part of the Silver State Series (formerly Governor's Series), the series of athletic competitions between the two schools.\n\nThe first game between the teams was in 1969 with Nevada defeating UNLV. The following year, the cannon was built and UNLV became the first team to win the cannon. Nevada has the longest win streak in the rivalry, having held the cannon for eight consecutive years.\n\nUNLV is the current holder of the trophy after overcoming a 23–0 deficit to beat Nevada 34–29 on November 24, 2018, at Sam Boyd Stadium, the last game in the series to be played in that stadium. The Fremont Cannon was played for on November 30, 2019, at Mackay Stadium in Reno, Nevada as UNLV retained the trophy by 33–30 in overtime.\n\nOn August 29, 2020, the UNLV Rebels will begin playing home games at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, which they will share with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nIn 1967, Bill Ireland was hired by Nevada Southern University (the predecessor to UNLV) to coach their new football team and by 1969 came up with the idea to have a trophy as a symbol of the rivalry between the two schools. Ireland was the first football coach of the UNLV Rebels and an alumnus and former coach of Nevada. The cannon was donated by Kennecott Copper and is a replica of a howitzer cannon that explorer John C. Fremont used on an expedition in 1843 and left in a large snowdrift in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The cannon contains a barrel, weighs , and cost $10,000 to build, making it the heaviest and most expensive trophy in college football. The cannon is painted the winning team's color, red for UNLV, and blue for Nevada.\n\nThe two schools first played each other on November 22, 1969, the Saturday before Thanksgiving Day. This game was homecoming for Nevada, who won the game 30–28. At the time, construction of the cannon had yet to be completed. The first competition for the cannon was in 1970 when the Rebels won 42–30 in Las Vegas. In 1978, following Nevada's first victory over UNLV in four seasons, Chris Ault convinced security at McCarran International Airport to allow the team to disassemble the cannon and take it as carry-on luggage back to Reno. The team had to figure out how to break down the cannon, a task that was usually done by the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, which UNLV did not have in 1978.\n\nThe Fremont Cannon was refurbished by the UNLV athletics department at a cost of $1,500 in 2000 following damage after a UNLV victory celebration wherein fans and players attempted to lift the cannon and dropped it. Traditionally, the team possessing the cannon would fire it each time they scored a touchdown during the rivalry game; however, the cannon has not been fired since the restoration due to the damage it received.\n\nStudents of Nevada's two public universities share a mutual disdain for each other, as evidenced by the numerous blue \"FUNLV\" (UNLV being shorthand for University of Nevada, Las Vegas) and red \"FUNR\" shirts (UNR being shorthand for University of Nevada, Reno) at the stadium on rivalry days.\n\nIn 1993, Wolf Pack coach Jeff Horton left Nevada after one season to coach for UNLV in what is referred to as the \"Red Defection\".\n\nThe rivalry is heated inside the stadium as well. Sam Boyd Stadium and Mackay Stadium are two of the few NCAA football venues remaining to sell alcohol to all spectators of legal age on game day (many institutions either do not sell alcohol at all, or sell it only to those seated in luxury boxes). This, combined with the heated nature of the rivalry, has resulted in numerous fights in the stands. In 1995, UNLV players allegedly started a pre-game brawl, which prompted the Wolf Pack to run up the score in their 55–32 victory against UNLV. After the game, UNLV player Quincy Sanders threw his helmet in the direction of Nevada head coach Chris Ault.\n\nOn August 18, 2010, Nevada announced that they would join the Mountain West Conference starting in either 2011 or 2012; their entry was later confirmed for 2012. Since UNLV has been in the Mountain West Conference since 1999, the annual rivalry game is once again a conference game. When the MW expanded to 12 football members in 2013 and split into divisions for that sport, both schools were placed in the West Division, assuring annual matchups for the foreseeable future. Before 2012, the last meeting of the two schools as conference rivals was in 1995, when both schools were members of the Big West Conference.\n\nOn October 8, 2012, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval announced the launch of the Governor's Series for the annual Nevada vs. UNLV rivalry games for all athletic teams. In 2018, it was later renamed as the Silver State Series.\n\n\nSince first game on November 22, 1969\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863693", "title": "Northern Railway of Canada", "text": "Northern Railway of Canada\n\nThe Northern Railway of Canada was a railway in the province of Ontario, Canada. It was the first steam railway to enter service in what was then known as Upper Canada. It was eventually acquired by the Grand Trunk Railway, and is therefore a predecessor to the modern Canadian National Railway (CNR). Several sections of the line are still used by CNR and GO Transit.\n\nFirst known as the Toronto, Simcoe and Huron Railway, and then the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway, the aim was to provide a portage route from the upper Great Lakes at Collingwood to Toronto. The plan for the railway was largely executed by Frederick Chase Capreol who was fired as manager of the company the day before the ground broke. Financial difficulties and a government bailout led to a reorganization of the company as the Northern Railway of Canada in 1859. The line saw three major expansions; North Grey Railway extended the original mainline to Meaford, the North Simcoe Railway ran to the port town of Penetanguishene, and the Muskoka Branch ran northeast to Gravenhurst. This last expansion would be the starting point for the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, connecting to the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline outside of North Bay. In 1887, the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) gained a controlling interest, and the takeover was formalized in January 1888.\n\nThe line primarily served the port towns on Georgian Bay, where it faced increasing competition over the years. A combination of factors, including the Great Depression and the opening of a wider Welland Canal led to decreased use of the ports, and traffic fell. The closure of Collingwood Shipbuilding in 1986 led to the abandonment of the sections in Collingwood and to the west. The line is intact from the southeast side of Collingwood all the way to Union Station, with the section between Toronto and Barrie used by GO Transit as the Barrie line. The Muskoka Junction has been combined with the Ontario Northland Railway to form CNR's mainline in the area north of Orillia. Section west of Collingwood now form the Georgian Trail. The Meaford station was dismantled after 1960 and two stations along this section of the line remain:\n\n\nSeveral sections of the line have been turned over to rail trail use. The section of the mainline from the western side of Collingwood to Meaford is now the high-quality Georgian Trail, which is being expanded towards Owen Sound as the Tom Thompson Trail. Sections from Collingwood to Stayner have a trail running beside them. The North Simcoe Railway now forms the Tiny Beaches Trail with sections south of this also in use.\n\nTalk about a line from Toronto to the upper Great Lakes has been recorded to as early as 1834, but no serious effort was taken until 1848 when Frederick Chase Capreol announced he was going to build a line to the Collingwood area under the name Toronto, Simcoe and Huron Railroad Union Company. He suggested a novel method to raise the funds for construction, using a $2 million lottery. The proposition was considered so scandalous it was put to a referendum and defeated. With the passage of the Guarantee Act in 1849, Capreol joined forces with Charles Albert Berczy and chartered the company in July 1849, now having to raise conventional bonds for the first , from which point government funding would be available.\n\nContinued difficulties delayed construction, during which time the company re-chartered as the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad in 1850. Capreol was fired as manager two days before the official sod turning, which was carried out on 15 October 1851 by Lady Elgin. The occasion was marked with a parade, to which an estimated 20,000 people attended of a total population of the city of only 31,000. Sandford Fleming took the sod and preserved it for history. A party later that night at St. Lawrence Hall was capped by a performance by Jenny Lind organized by P.T. Barnum.\n\nIn February 1853, the railway commissioned the construction of the first locomotive built in any British colony. Early construction required the line to pass over the Oak Ridges Moraine, and it was not until 16 May 1853 that the first train reached Machell's Corners, today's Aurora, Ontario. Work north of there was much more rapid; the line reached Allandale in Barrie later in 1853, and Collingwood in 1855. Early traffic was dominated by agricultural products, earning it the nickname \"Oats, Straw, and Hay\".\n\nIn spite of reasonable volumes of traffic the line was never very profitable, and by 1858 the company was in financial difficulty. Frederick William Cumberland agreed to take control of the railway, after reorganizing as the Northern Railway Company of Canada in August 1858. Cumberland focused on profitability, cutting any train that didn't pay for itself, strongly resisting any expansion plans, and selling off their small fleet of ships operating on the Great Lakes.\n\nThis resistance to expansion would ultimately backfire; in 1864 the company was approached by businessmen from Grey and Bruce counties about building a line through their burgeoning agricultural areas. Cumberland refused, stating that traffic would be too low. This left an opening for the formation of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (TG&B), which began construction toward Owen Sound in the spring of 1869.\n\nFaced with their first real competition, the Northern chartered their own North Grey Railway on 15 February 1871, with plans to extend out of Collingwood to Meaford and authority to continue to Owen Sound. Construction between Collingwood and Meaford took place over the flat terrain between the Niagara Escarpment and the southern shore of Georgian Bay, and the line was completed on 1 April 1872. However, the expansion to Owen Sound was never completed; a combination of much more difficult terrain west of Meaford, the impending arrival of the TG&B, and demand for other expansions that were considered more important.\n\nThe company had continually been at odds with a number of groups in Simcoe County, especially those in Barrie who continually pushed for an expansion of the line into the downtown area. This was eventually solved through the late 1869 formation of the Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway, or Muskoka Branch, which branched off at the Allendale station and ran north-east to Orillia and then on to Lake Muskoka outside Gravenhurst. The line was officially absorbed into the Northern in 1875.\n\nUpset with the Northern remained, and demand for additional shipping routes on the Lakes led to intense building through the entire area. Businessmen in Hamilton took the opportunity to plan a second line to Barrie as the Hamilton and North-Western Railway (H&NW), with their proposed line passing through several towns along the way. The Northern countered with the suggestion for a South Simcoe Junction Railway, splitting off the existing line at King City or Bolton, and then meeting the Northern again west of Barrie and continuing on to Penetanguishene as the North Simcoe Railway.\n\nComparing the two, business interests in Simcoe County and towns along the route demanded additional work from both companies. The H&NW finally agreed to run a branch line to Collingwood, splitting off the mainline some distance west of Newmarket, and added optional plans for an extension north from Barrie to Midland. Bonuses from Simcoe County totalling $300,000 were given to the H&NW, along with about $150,000 from towns along the route, some indication of the area's upset with the Northern. The line reached Barrie in 1877 and Collingwood in mid-1879. The H&NW never completed their northern expansion to Midland. \n\nThe Northern went ahead with one portion of their own expansion plans, dropping plans for the line from King City and instead splitting off west of Barrie to run north to Penetanguishene as the North Simcoe Railway. Construction began in January 1878.\n\nIn 1881, the entire line was regauged in sections. The entire mainline to Gravenhurst was converted to standard gauge in a single day on 9 July 1881. Work gangs were located all along the line waiting for the 7:45 AM mail train leaving Toronto, which carried a large card reading \"Last Train\". The crews moved the rails as soon as the train passed them, having already half driven the spikes.\n\nThe cost of construction, general financial difficulties of the era, and the enormous cost of an expansion to North Bay led the Northern and H&NW to organize a new joint management agreement, forming the Northern and North Western Railway in June 1879. This provided the funding and income needed to begin construction of the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, which ran between Gravenhurst and Nipissing. This reached the Canadian Pacific Railway transcontinental lines at North Bay in 1886.\n\nThe Northern Railway was purchased by Grand Trunk Railway in 1888, and through its amalgamation, became part of the Canadian National Railway. CNR operated the mainline as the CN Newmarket Subdivision, selling off the branches to the west, and pulling up the section between Barrie and Orillia. It is now the Barrie line after its purchase by Metrolinx.\n\nThe first locomotive of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad was named \"Lady Elgin\" and built in Portland, Maine. It was named for Mary Lambton, second wife of James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, the 42nd Governor General of Canada (1847–1854); she had also lifted a ceremonial silver spade for the sod-turning ceremony of the construction of the railway at Front Street and Simcoe Street on 15 October 1851. Because of the high customs duties and shipping costs for the locomotive, executives of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad decided that subsequent locomotives would be built in Ontario.\n\nThe James Good foundry \"Toronto Locomotive Works\", located at the corner of Queen and Yonge Street, would manufacture nine locomotives for the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron railway at an average cost of $5000. The first of these was named \"Toronto\", built in its namesake city and the first locomotive built in Canada or in any colony of the British Empire. Commissioned in February 1853, its construction was completed by 16 April. Over five days, it was rolled along temporary wooden rails on Queen Street and York Street, and on 26 April it was lifted onto the new OSH railway tracks on Front Street. Torontonians would monitor the locomotive's progress from the foundry to the Front Street tracks, and the event was the subject of a later artistic rendering. Its first duty was three weeks later, transporting passengers and freight between the city of Toronto and the community of Machell's Corner, now known as Aurora. This first duty is commemorated by a plaque installed in 1953 at Union Station in Toronto. The \"Toronto\" and other locomotives were scrapped after Canadian railways converted from the 5'6\" track gauge to the 4'8\" American standard gauge starting in the 1870s.\n\nThe railway earned revenues from passenger, freight, postal, and sundry other sources. The total earnings for 1 January to 7 July 1860 were $166,108.64, and for 1 January to 6 July 1861 were $210,177.46.\n\nIn 2010, the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway was inducted to the North America Railway Hall of Fame. The OS&HR was recognized for its contribution to railroading as a \"Community, Business, Government or Organization\" in the \"National\" category (pertaining specifically to the area in and around St. Thomas, Ontario.)\n\n\n\n"}

He was capped seven times by England, and played in the Football League for Birmingham City, Norwich City and Millwall. He also had a spell in Malaysia with Selangor and spent a season as player-manager of Barnet.\n\nHe played in Everton's 1989 FA Cup Final defeat to Liverpool, and won the League Cup with Leicester City in 2000. His final career tally was 579 league games and 226 goals (99 of which for Everton). In all competitions, he managed 712 games and 293 goals. He exceeded his ambition to score 200 league goals in his career, but fell just short of his target of 300 goals in all competitions. Still, he was one of the most prolific goalscorers that English football saw during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nCottee began his career at West Ham, where he made his first team debut in the First Division against Tottenham Hotspur on 1 January 1983, at the age of 17, scoring in the process. He played a total of eight games in the 1982–83 season, scoring five goals. He established himself in the first team during the 1983–84 season, when still only 18, and scored 15 times in the league. He did even better in 1984–85, when he scored 17 First Division goals. By the age of 20, he had already managed an impressive 37 league goals.\n\nHe was a prolific goalscorer especially in his West Ham days, where he was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year in 1986, the year where West Ham finished third (their highest league finish to date) and came just four points away from the title. He scored 20 times in the league during that season, though his strike partner Frank McAvennie did even better with 26 league goals. Still, their 46-goal strike partnership was the most prolific in the league that season.\n\n1986–87 saw Cottee score 22 league goals – which would be the highest of his career. However, Frank McAvennie alongside him could only manage seven league goals that season and this contributed to a downturn in West Ham's form as they finished 15th. Cottee managed a further 13 league goals in 1987–88, but McAvennie had been sold to Celtic early in the season and the failure of manager John Lyall to find an adequate replacement contributed to West Ham disappointing in the league again, finishing 16th. By this time, the 23-year-old Cottee had already managed 212 league games and 92 goals for Hammers.\n\nCottee briefly became the most expensive player to be signed by a British club when on 2 August 1988 he joined Everton in a £2.2 million deal (a fee eclipsed by Ian Rush's return to Liverpool from Juventus later that month).\n\nHe made his Everton debut on 27 August 1988, the opening day of the 1988–89 First Division campaign, in a 4–0 home win over Newcastle United in which he scored a hat-trick. He managed a further 10 league goals that season, though Everton were relatively disappointing in the league as they finished eighth – having been a top four club and twice champions in the previous four seasons. However, they did reach the FA Cup final and were paired with neighbours Liverpool at Wembley on 20 May 1989. It was a close contest but in the end Everton lost 3–2 in extra time. Earlier in the season Cottee and his colleagues and been on the receiving end of another Wembley defeat, this time to Nottingham Forest who beat them 4–3 in the final of the Full Members Cup, but Cottee still managed to get on the scoresheet twice.\n\nCottee spent his first season at Goodison Park playing alongside Graeme Sharp, but for 1989–90 manager Colin Harvey changed the formation to 4–3–3 and brought in Mike Newell as Everton's third striker. The season began very promisingly for Everton, who went top of the league on 21 October and stayed there until mid November, but their title hopes gradually disintegrated and they finished sixth while the title went to Liverpool. Cottee once again managed 13 league goals in a season.\n\n1990–91 was arguably Everton's worst season in a decade. Manager Colin Harvey was sacked on 31 October 1990 with the Toffees third from bottom in the First Division, and a week later Howard Kendall (who had guided them to two league titles, an FA Cup and a European Cup Winners' Cup in his first spell from 1981 to 1987) was appointed with Harvey returning as his assistant. Everton's form improved under Kendall and they finished ninth, also reaching the FA Cup quarter-finals and ousting Liverpool in the fifth round after two replays; Cottee was Everton's saviour in the first replay on 21 February as he scored a late equaliser which forced a 4–4 draw in Liverpool's last game before the resignation of manager Kenny Dalglish the following day. Cottee managed 10 league goals in the 1990–91 season.\n\n1991–92 was a frustrating season for Cottee and his colleagues. By mid November he had new strike partners in Peter Beardsley and Mo Johnston following the sale of both Graeme Sharp and Mike Newell, and while the new look strikeforce was reasonably productive, the rest of the team struggled to match their standards. Cottee was restricted to eight goals from 24 games through injury, and Everton finished mid table once again. It was the first time since his debut season nine years earlier that he had scored less than 10 league goals in a season.\n\n1992–93 saw Everton participate in the inaugural FA Premier League, and Cottee did better this time, scoring 12 goals.\n\nHe managed 16 league goals in 1993–94, but it was a disastrous season for Everton who only narrowly avoided relegation just seven years after being league champions. These include Everton's first two hat-tricks in the Premier League, the first being in a 4–2 home win over Sheffield United early in the season, and then in a 6–2 home win over Swindon Town in January.\n\nNew manager Mike Walker, who arrived in January 1994, promised an overhaul of the squad and Cottee was soon being linked with a move back to his beloved West Ham.\n\nHe returned to West Ham United on 7 September 1994 in a part exchange deal for defender David Burrows plus cash. Everton manager Mike Walker had signed Nigerian Daniel Amokachi fresh from World Cup duty and financed the move by selling Cottee, much to Everton fans' disapproval. He had played 184 league games in six years for the Toffees, scoring 76 goals, but had not won any major trophies. His overall career tally for league goals now stood at 164.\n\nCottee made his second debut for the Hammers away to Liverpool and was sent off after 54 minutes, although his first season back at Upton Park brought 13 league goals as he helped West Ham fight off relegation and finished 14th in their first season under the management of Harry Redknapp. He had a further 10 goals in 1995–96 as the Hammers finished 10th – their highest finish since 1986 – but he then lost his place in the team to new arrivals Florin Raducioiu and Hugo Porfirio, managing just three games and failing to score in the Premier League before joining Selangor of Malaysia on a free transfer in October 1996. Over two spells at West Ham, he had scored 115 league goals. Added to his goals scored for Everton, he had now managed 187 league goals.\n\nAlthough Cottee spent less than a year in Malaysia with Selangor, he was still able to win the first major trophy of his career, winning the FAM Cup with the \"Red Giants\", before he returned to England and signed for Football League Cup winners Leicester City for £500,000 in August 1997, where he was presented with his first chance of European football at the age of 32 as Leicester had an ultimately short lived campaign in that season's UEFA Cup. He managed 19 league games and scored four goals as the Foxes finished 10th, and one of those goals came in a shock 1–0 win over title chasing Manchester United at Old Trafford on 31 January 1998. He also had a loan spell at Birmingham City in Division One that season, and in his first taste of second-tier football managed to score one goal. In the semi-final of the 1998–99 Football League Cup against Sunderland Cottee scored three goals across the two legs (two in the first and one in the second) to help Leicester win 3–2 on aggregate. However they lost the final to Tottenham Hotspur. In 1999–2000, aged 34, he finally won a major trophy in England as he helped Leicester defeat Tranmere Rovers 2–1 in the Football League Cup final. That season he scored 13 league goals, which remained the most Premier League goals scored by a Leicester player in a single season until the 2015–16 season, when Jamie Vardy surpassed his total. He remained at Filbert Street until 11 September 2000, by which time he had played a total of 85 league games for the Foxes and scored 27 goals. This brought his total career tally to 214 goals in the English top division, making him the 17th highest goal scorer in the history of English top flight football.\n\nIn September 2000, Cottee joined Norwich City as player-coach under recently appointed manager Bryan Hamilton, however this did not last long as Cottee struggled to meet the demands placed on him, scoring two goals against Blackpool in the League Cup and Sheffield United in the league.\n\nA week after resigning from Barnet, Cottee signed for Millwall on transfer deadline day. During this season, which was his last as a player, Cottee played for a different team in each of the top four divisions of English football in the same season, a rare achievement last performed by goalkeeper Eric Nixon in 1986–87.\n\nAfter being released by Norwich on 31 October 2000, he took over as player-manager of Barnet, a team closer to his home in London. After winning his first game with the club 7–0 vs Blackpool, Barnet hit a run of poor form which left them facing relegation from the Football League. Cottee resigned on 16 March 2001, however his replacement, John Still (who left the club just before Cottee's appointment six months earlier), was unable to rescue the team from relegation. However, Cottee did manage an impressive nine goals from 16 Division Three games.\n\nCottee made his debut for England against Sweden on 10 September 1986 as a substitute and went on to win 7 caps, starting once against Scotland at Hampden Park in the 1989 Rous Cup in a 2–0 win.\n\nCottee has admitted to diligently maintaining a scrapbook containing press cuttings of every goal he has scored throughout his playing career.\n\nHe is now a commentator with Sky Sports and occasional pundit for Malaysian network Astro, appearing on its 2010 World Cup and Premier League studio coverage in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nCottee made a cameo appearance in the 2018 action film, \"Final Score\" in which he was murdered on live television.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a regional air carrier operating inter-island services within the Canary Islands, and other Atlantic islands. Affiliated airlines operate on behalf of Binter in services to Morocco, Portugal and Western Sahara.\n\nThe airline was established on 18 February 1988 and started operations on 26 March 1989. It was formed as a subsidiary of Iberia. Binter Canarias began operations as a regional airline and is currently the only one to operate in the eight airports of the Canaries. Binter also operates connections with Marrakech, Dakar, Aaiun in Africa; Madeira, and Lisbon in Portugal; Sal in Cape Verde; and Vigo and Mallorca in Spain . The airline also flies to the island of Madeira, serving the capital Funchal. Regular flights to the cities of Bergamo and Paris, were trialled but later cancelled as unsuccessful projects. Nowadays has regular flights to Lisbon and Cape Verde for renting technical crew and aircraft (CRJ) to Air Nostrum. The airline also serves Africa: it operates scheduled flights to Marrakech and Casablanca in Morocco and Laayoune in Western Sahara, alongside charter flights to Nouadibou and Nouakchott in Mauritania.\n\nIn late 1999 SEPI (the Spanish state holding company of Iberia) implemented the privatisation of Binter Canarias, but held on to a \"golden share\", permitting it to authorise any future shareholding deal of more than 25%. However, the airline was wholly owned by Hesperia Inversiones Aéreas, which bought the airline in July 2002. In 2003 Binter Canarias, SAU was absorbed by Hesperia Inversiones Aéreas, SA, which took the name of Binter Canarias, SA. It is now owned by Ilsamar Tenerife (49.81%), Ferma Canarias Electrica (10.44%), Agencia Maritima Afroamericana (10.11%), Flapa (10%) and others (19.6%) and has 406 employees. Binter has sales offices, Binter Vende, at the airports and, since 2005, the ground support service has been provided by Atlántica Handling. Since January 2008 the Technical assistance service for Binter aircraft has been provided by BinterTechnic.\n\nSome of the owners of Binter Canarias decided to buy Navegacion y Servicios Aéreos Canarios (NAYSA) and to transfer some planes from Binter to NAYSA in order to reduce costs and increase benefits.\n\nIn 2016 the airline agreed a deal for a further six ATR 72-600 aircraft, bringing total commitments to the type to 18. They will replace ATR 72-500 aircraft. In spring 2018, Binter decided to merge Navegacion y Servicios Aéreos Canarios (NAYSA) into its own operations and therefore handed back NAYSA's air operator certificate. Since then, all former NAYSA operations are part of Binter's. Since late 2017, Binter Cabo Verde has taken over inter-island flights after its discontinuation of theirs by TACV on August 1, 2017 as TACV was restructuring and privatisation. Binter CV established a partnership covering TACV's international services, allowing TACV to offer connections to domestic destinations and will seek to strengthen inter-island connections.\nIn June 2018 it began the domestic operation between Madeira and Porto Santo Islands in the northern neighboring Madeiran archipelago.\n\nAs of January 2019, Binter Canarias serves the following destinations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Binter Canarias operates the following aircraft:\n\nBinter Canarias has converted two options for Embraer E195-E2 aircraft to firm orders. Their first new Embraer aircraft is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2019 with Binter Canarias being the European launch customer. The first example was unveiled on 22nd November 2019, to Binter executives & the press. The EIS date is December 2019.\n\nThe Binter Canarias fleet has previously included the Boeing 737-400 (leased from Futura International, in a special livery), the ATR 72-202 (the predecessor to their ATR 72-500 and later their ATR 72-600 aircraft), the CASA 235 (the first aircraft operated by Binter, the Bombardier CRJ-200 and CRJ-900 (all CRJ aircraft were leased from Air Nostrum, and their current CRJ1000 aircraft still are).\n\n\nThe airline was named Europe's best regional airline in 2005 (a celebratory livery was installed on their single Boeing 737-400) and, in September 2010, it was announced that the Spanish carrier had won the European Regions Airline Association \"(ERA)\" Gold Award for the best Airline of the Year 2010/2011. In October 2016 the airline was awarded the European Regional Airlines Association Airline of the Year award and was commended for its constant growth and expansion into new markets.\n\n\n"}

It was one of the palaces owned by Federico da Montefeltro and his wife Battista Sforza and was a fortified, palatial retreat. It is now a museum.\n\nThe first fortification on the top of the mountain was built by the Romans. In the Middle Ages it was bitterly fought over by the Byzantines, Goths, Franks and Lombards. Between 961 and 963 Berengar II, the last king of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy, was besieged by Otto I of Saxony. Around the middle of the eleventh century the Counts of Montecopiolo came to Montefeltro, the ancient name of San Leo, from which they took the name and title. In the second half of the 14th century the Malatesta were able to capture the fortress, but until the middle of the 15th century, the castle was often retaken by the Montefeltro. In 1441 the young Federico da Montefeltro scaled the walls of the fort. Faced with the new military dangers, he had the fortress rebuilt, entrusting the task to the Sienese engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini.\n\nThe new structure allowed for a dynamic counter-offensive, providing for cross-fire. The fortress sides were equipped with artillery and the access points were rendered unreachable by enemy fire thanks to military outposts.\n\nIn 1502, Cesare Borgia, with the support of Pope Alexander VI, took possession of the fortress. At the death of the pope, in 1503, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro took possession of his dominions. In 1516 the Florentine troops, supported this time by Pope Leo X and guided by Antonio Ricasoli, penetrated the city and commandeered the fort.\n\nFrom 1527 until the devolution to the Papal State from the Duchy of Urbino in 1631, San Leo belonged to the Della Rovere. With the new ownership, the fortress was used as a prison. Among the inmates were Felice Orsini and Freemason Alessandro Cagliostro . In 1906 the fortress ceased to be a prison and for eight years, until 1914, it hosted a \"compagnia di disciplina\".\n\nIn the period of Italia Unita, the municipality of San Leo belonged to the province of Marche (Province of Pesaro and Urbino), until 15 August 2009 when it was separated together with six other municipalities of the Valmarecchia, following the outcome of a referendum held on 17 and 18 December 2006.\n\nCurrently the castle houses a museum and an art gallery in arms.\n\nIn the fortress there are two distinct parts: the keep, with its square turrets and the gothic entrance is the older part and residential wing; and the more recent round towers and massive corbeled wall that connects them. The two towers, the wall, and the keep surround the so-called Place d'Armes.\n\nThe area is dotted with rocky peaks that rise steeply from the sea cliffs. On each of these peaks, the ruins of a castle or fort recall a tumultuous past. To the visitor who walks up the Romagna plain, the City-Fortress appears as a huge shield of high smooth rock. It appears like a ship with the bow to the East, the bell tower like a mast, and the handful of houses scattered around.\n\n\n"}

However, unlike rural ridings in the prairies, most Nova Scotia ridings hold Red Tory views rather than socially conservative ones, as reflected in Nova Scotia being one of the few areas in the country where the Progressive Conservatives remained competitive between their 1993 collapse and their 2003 merger with the Canadian Alliance. The Liberals swept Nova Scotia in their 1993 landslide, but managed to lose every single seat in 1997. Under former leader Alexa McDonough, the NDP made major gains there in 1997; picking up seats in the Halifax and Cape Breton areas. The Liberals, wiped out in 1997, made a resurgence in 2000. The Liberals' strengths are concentrated in Cape Breton and the Halifax area. The NDP's strengths are concentrated in the Halifax area. The Conservatives' strengths are concentrated in rural mainland Nova Scotia. In 2015, the Liberals swept Nova Scotia in convincing fashion, winning an outright majority of the votes cast in all but one riding.

His five sons, Cyrus Baldwin (1773–1854), Benjamin Franklin Baldwin (1777–1821), Loammi Baldwin, Jr. (1780–1834), James Fowle Baldwin (1782–1862), and George Rumford Baldwin (1798–1888) were also well-known engineers. He surveyed and was responsible for the construction of the Middlesex Canal, but today he is perhaps best remembered for the Baldwin apple which he developed at his farm, or rather he recognized its potential and propagated it throughout the northeast. The apple had been discovered on the farm of John Ball in Wilmington, Massachusetts, around 1750, and named Woodpecker by a later owner of the farm. Colonel Baldwin's promotion of the apple occurred after 1784. He was also a surveyor and plantation co-owner in Hartford, Maine, which at that time was known as East Butterfield.\n\nBaldwin attended grammar school in Woburn, Massachusetts. Later he would walk from North Woburn to Cambridge with his younger friend and childhood neighbor, Benjamin Thompson, later Count Rumford, to attend the lectures of Professor John Winthrop at Harvard College. He and Thompson performed their own experiments at home. Baldwin received a Master of Arts degree from Harvard in 1785.\n\nIn 1774, Baldwin enlisted in a regiment, and commanded the Woburn militia at the Battle of Lexington and Concord as a major. He is recorded as having described the events of April 19, 1775 as follows \"We mustered as fast as possible. The Town turned out extraordinary, and proceeded toward Lexington.\" As a major at the time he continues \"I rode along a little before the main body, and when I was nigh Jacob Reed's (at present Durenville) I heard a great firing; proceeded on, soon heard that the Regulars had fired upon Lexington people and killed a large number of them. We proceeded on as fast as possible and came to Lexington and saw about eight or ten dead and numbers wounded.\" He then, with the rest from Woburn, proceeded to Concord by way of Lincoln meeting house, ascended a hill there, and rested and refreshed themselves a little. Then follows a particular account of the action and of his own experience. He had \"several good shots,\" and proceeded on till coming between the meeting-house and Buckman's tavern at Lexington, with a prisoner before him, the cannon of the British began to play, the balls flying near him, and for safety he retreated back behind the meeting-house, when a ball came through near his head, and he further retreated to a meadow north of the house and lay there and heard the balls in the air and saw them strike the ground. Woburn sent to the field on that day, one hundred and eighty men.\nAt the beginning of the war, he enlisted in the 26th Continental Regiment commanded by Colonel Samuel Gerrish. Here he rapidly advanced to be lieutenant-colonel, and upon Colonel Gerrish's retirement in August 1775, he was placed in command of the regiment, and was soon commissioned colonel.\n\nUntil the end of 1775, Baldwin and his men remained near Boston, but in April 1776, he was ordered with his command to New York City. He took part in the Battle of Pell's Point on October 18, 1776. On the night of December 25–26, in the face of a violent and extremely cold storm of snow and hail, General Washington and his army crossed the Delaware to the New Jersey side, and fought the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26. Baldwin and his regiment participated in both the crossing and the fight. In 1777, Baldwin resigned from the army because of ill health.\n\nBaldwin was elected to various public offices between 1780 and 1796. He was appointed high sheriff of Middlesex County in 1780, and was the first to hold office after the adoption of the state constitution. From 1778-1784, he represented Woburn in the Massachusetts General Court. In 1794, he was a candidate for election to the United States House of Representatives, and obtained all the votes cast in Woburn but one.\n\nBaldwin began work with his older sons on the Middlesex Canal in 1794 and after nine years, the canal began service in 1803. He later worked on Boston's fortifications. His son Cyrus continued his father's work on the Middlesex Canal as an agent for the canal company. His son Benjamin worked on the Boston Mill Dam until his early death at the age of 43.\n\nBaldwin was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782. He opposed Shays' Rebellion. His published work as a member of the AAAS included early experiments with electricity \"An account of a Curious Appearance of the Electrical Fluid,\" (Memoirs Am. Acad. Vol. 1, 1785, pp. 257–259); and \"Observations on Electricity and an Improved Mode of Constructing Lightning Rods,\" (Memoirs, Vol. 2, pt. 2, 1804, pp. 96–104). The first paper was written in 1783, and the \"curious appearance\" described was produced by raising an electrical kite at the time of a thunder shower. The experiments, however, were tried in July, 1771. At that time the author mentions that there stood some lofty trees near his house, and also a shop near by it. His parents, family, and neighbors witnessed the \"electrical effect\" he succeeded in producing. The date of preparing the second article was January 25, 1797.\n\nHis home Baldwin House—originally built in 1660 and expanded in the 1800s—still stands in Woburn and is currently in use as a Chinese restaurant.\n\nBaldwin married July 9, 1772, Mary Fowle (died 1786 age 39) daughter of James Fowle, Jr. and Mary Reed, and had four sons. He married again, May 26, 1791, Margaret Fowle (1747-1799), daughter of Josiah and Margery Carter, and had a son and a daughter.\n\nHoward Means in \"Johnny Appleseed: The Man, the Myth, The American Story\", references Baldwin as a cousin of John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed.)\n\n\n"}

It is south of Worksop, which has been called its \"gateway\". The ducal seats were: \n\nA fifth large country house, Rufford Abbey in this area belonged to the 2nd to 8th Savile baronets, their later-to-be ennobled heirs (with the territorial designation of Halifax), then from 1888 until 1938 to 1st to 3rd Lords Savile. Welbeck Woodhouse is a further notable mansion, in the former park (grounds) of Welbeck Abbey and was built by Lord Portland in the 1930s.\n\nThe Dukeries saw four ducal families in close proximity among fewer than twenty at any given time current (\"extant\") English dukedoms and their parks or farmed lands largely neighbouring to the point of being at most points touching (contiguous).\n\nThe last mansion in single-family occupation is Welbeck Abbey – by a great-nephew of the final (seventh) Duke of Portland. The late Duke had neighbouring Welbeck Woodhouse built in the early 1930s when he bore his courtesy marquessate style. The latter property is equally intact, , north east of the main house and long.\n\nThe incumbent Duke of Norfolk sold Worksop Manor to the Duke of Newcastle in 1839. The Norfolks preferred to spend more time at Arundel Castle and the Duke of Newcastle wanted the land to enlarge his estate and had the main part of the house demolished. The service wing was adapted into a smaller mansion-esque country house later in the 19th century, which survives. Clumber House was demolished by the Dukes of Newcastle in the 1930s because they could no longer afford the upkeep, but the Victorian chapel survived, and the park now belongs to the National Trust. Thoresby Hall opened as a country house hotel early in the 21st century after a period of neglect, though the wider Thoresby Estate remains in the hands of the descendants of the Dukes of Kingston.\n\nAlthough not part of the Dukeries, Nottingham Castle, a former residence of the Dukes of Newcastle is also situated in Nottinghamshire, as is the former seat of the Dukes of St Albans at Bestwood Lodge. Bestwood St Albans, a civil parish in the Gedling borough of Nottinghamshire, maintains a link with the Dukes of St Albans through its name.\n\nIn the early 20th century the economic and social base of the Dukeries was dramatically influenced by the development of its underlying coalfield, the eastern extension of the Nottinghamshire coalfield.\n\nFive coal mines were opened after the first shaft sinking commenced in 1920. The coal mines were at Clipstone (coal won 1922), Ollerton (1925), Blidworth (1926), Bilsthorpe (1927) and Thoresby near Edwinstowe (1928). The landowners auctioned or leased their mineral rights: Earl Manvers' Thoresby estate in May 1919 and Lord Savile of Rufford Abbey's lease for Ollerton in 1921. Colliery companies such as the Butterley Company at Ollerton and the Stanton Company at Thoresby bought the rights. The companies financed the construction of pit villages to house the miners and their families, who migrated from older coalfields throughout Britain.\n\nThe villages offered facilities, such as a distinctive heating system provided by the mine running in pipes between houses in New Ollerton. While displaying characteristics of paternalism the villages were restrictive, as some companies employed company policemen and discouraged trade unionism, apart from the breakaway Nottinghamshire Miners' Industrial Union (NMIU) of George Spencer in the 1930s. Work at the Dukeries collieries did not cease even during the coal and general strike of 1926. The Labour party was not electorally successful in the mining villages until 1946, after the Second World War had weakened the power of the employers.\n\n"}

Robert Greenhouse, a physician and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and Dorothy (née Greenlick). She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Radcliffe College in 1968, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She received her Master of Studies in Law from Yale Law School in 1978.\n\nShe married lawyer Eugene R. Fidell on January 1, 1981 in Washington, D.C., in a Jewish ceremony. Together they have one daughter, filmmaker Hannah Margalit Fidell (born October 7, 1985).\n\nGreenhouse began her 40-year career at \"The New York Times\" covering state government in the paper's bureau in Albany. After completing her master's degree on a Ford Foundation fellowship, she returned to the \"Times\" and covered 29 sessions of the Supreme Court from 1978 to 2007, with the exception of two years during the mid-1980s during which she covered Congress. Since 1981, she has published over 2,800 articles in the \"Times.\" She has been a regular guest on the PBS program \"Washington Week\".\n\nIn 2008, Greenhouse accepted an offer from \"The Times\" for an early retirement at the end of the Supreme Court session in the summer of 2008. Seven of the nine sitting Justices attended a goodbye party for Greenhouse on June 12, 2008. She continues to blog for \"The Times\" in the \"Opinionator\" section.\n\nIn 2010, Greenhouse and co-author Reva Siegel put out a book on the development of the abortion debate prior to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling on the subject: \"Before Roe v. Wade\". This was largely a selection of primary documents, though with some commentary.\n\nGreenhouse criticized US policies and actions at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and Haditha in a 2006 speech at Harvard University. In it, Greenhouse said she started crying a few years back at a Simon & Garfunkel concert because her generation hadn't done a better job of running the country than previous generations.\n\nGreenhouse was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Journalism (Beat Reporting) in 1998 \"for her consistently illuminating coverage of the United States Supreme Court.\" In 2004, she received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism and the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism. She was a Radcliffe Institute Medal winner in 2006.\n\nWhen she was at Radcliffe, she said in a speech given in 2006, \"I was the Harvard stringer for the \"Boston Herald\", which regularly printed, and paid me for, my accounts of student unrest and other newsworthy events at Harvard. But when it came time during my senior year to look for a job in journalism, the \"Herald\" would not even give me an interview, and neither would the \"Boston Globe\", because these newspapers had no interest in hiring women.\"\n\nGreenhouse has expressed her personal views as an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and critic of conservative religious values, and a 2006 report on NPR questioned whether this compromised the appearance that she maintains journalistic neutrality on such matters. \"New York Times\" public editor Daniel Okrent said that he has never received a single complaint of bias in Greenhouse's coverage.\n\nOn August 9, 2007, a television crew from C-SPAN was forbidden to film a panel discussion at a meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. Greenhouse had told organizers that she would not be able answer questions as fully and frankly if the session were filmed. The vice president of programming at C-SPAN, Terence Murphy, questioned the decision: \"If professors of journalism and working journalists taking part in a journalism education conference don't stand up for open media access to public policy discussions, who will?\"\n\nEd Whelan, writing in a blog associated with \"National Review\", suggested that Greenhouse had an obligation to her readers to inform them when reporting on a Supreme Court case that her husband Eugene Fidell had submitted an amicus brief: He had submitted an amicus brief in the \"Hamdan\" case. Fidell also submitted an amicus brief in the \"Boumediene\" case when it was at the D.C. Circuit level before it went to the Supreme Court. Clark Hoyt, the public editor of the \"New York Times\" at the time, opined that the paper \"should have clued in readers\" to Greenhouse's conflict, but defended the neutrality of her coverage.\n\nEmily Bazelon and Dahlia Lithwick, writing in \"Slate magazine\", complained that the \"New York Times\" \"had failed to stand up\" for Greenhouse and defended Greenhouse from Whelan's criticism. \nThey quoted Yale Law School professor Judith Resnik who pointed out that Whelan had been unable to point to any actual sign of bias.\n\nIn a rebuttal in the \"National Review\", Whelan asserted both that Bazelon and Lithwick had resorted to \"baseless ad hominem attacks and to (literally) catty comments about 'right-wing kitty cats.'\" He then refutes the claim that he did not provide any actual examples of bias, and points readers to a previous article in his series on Greenhouse's alleged conflict of interest.\n\n\n"}

She started her career in the music industry as a vocalist for the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, and is the former lead vocalist for the symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes. She is known for her work in close association with her then-husband and leader of the German band Atrocity, Alexander Krull. Currently she is a singer of a German band Midnattsol alongside her younger sister Carmen Elise Espenæs.\n\nLiv Kristine was born in Stavanger, and joined the Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy in 1994 as a backup singer, but was soon sharing lead vocals duties with Raymond István Rohonyi. She was fired from Theatre of Tragedy in 2003, a fact she learned about through the band's website. She had been living in Germany since 1996 and collaborating with the death metal band Atrocity, whose singer Alexander Krull she married on 3 July 2003. With the five musicians from Atrocity she formed a new band, Leaves' Eyes, in August 2003. She has also released five solo albums, the most recent of which was released in October 2014 through Napalm Records.\n\nKristine has a soprano vocal range.\n\nIn 2005, Liv Kristine was nominated for a Grammy award with Cradle of Filth for the song \"Nymphetamine\".\n\nIn 2016, Liv joined Eluveitie as a session vocalist for a couple of their live shows after the departure of their singer Anna Murphy.\n\nOn 16 April 2016, Leaves' Eyes stated that Liv Kristine, who formed and had the idea of the band project, was no longer the singer of the band.\n\nIn December 2017 it was announced that Liv joins her sister Carmen's band Midnattsol. She was originally announced to be a guest on their new album but after some discussions, the band picked her up as a permanent member.\n\nOn 3 July 2003, Liv Kristine married Atrocity vocalist Alexander Krull. They have a son, Leon Alexander. Liv Kristine and her husband split-up in early January 2016.\n\nHer younger sister, Carmen Elise Espenæs, is the vocalist of the German symphonic/folk metal band Midnattsol and of the Norwegian gothic/folk metal band Savn.\n\nKristine helped to pioneer the beauty and the beast vocals approach, later used by many other successful bands such as Tristania, After Forever, Epica and Within Temptation in their beginnings. The term \"beauty and the beast\" refers to an aesthetic contrasting \"angelic\" female vocals with male growls or aggressive singing. Paradise Lost and The Gathering had already made use of this technique on some songs from their earlier albums but it was the Norwegian Theatre of Tragedy, Kristine's former band, that first released an entire album devoted to this approach with their self-titled debut in 1995.\n\nA second album \"Velvet Darkness They Fear\" arrived in the following year. Theatre of Tragedy's third album \"Aégis\" in 1998 saw the band \"venturing into fresh musical territory\". The piano was replaced by electronic keyboards while Raymond Rohonyi opted to discard his death growls in favor of a \"soft, spoken, sometimes whispering voice\". The music was more clean and soft, \"stripped of guitar harshness\" but with a \"near flawless execution\" that \"prompted many European critics to award \"Aégis\" perfect review scores\".\n\nFor over a decade, this beauty and the beast aesthetic has flourished with many representatives across the European continent. Cradle of Filth has also been known to make use of this approach through guest female vocalists such as Liv Kristine and Sarah Jezebel Deva.\n\n"}

A TOC usually includes a small group of specially trained officers or military personnel who guide members of an active tactical element during a mission.\n\nMost permanent tactical operations centers are highly technical and contain a number of advanced computer systems for monitoring operational progress and maintaining communications with operators in the field. One of the best-known TOCs is NORAD which houses the North American Military Aerospace Defense operations.\n\nTOC Officers are usually positioned in a way that enables line-of-sight communication between team members, as well as overall communication with the TOC operations officer (or commander). Common configurations include center-facing monitors and against the wall monitors. Larger TOCs have a location where senior leaders are able to sit and observe operations of subordinate units. Smaller TOCs and field TOCs can be created in the back of vans and trucks, as well as in tents and buildings by setting up computers and linking in communication equipment.\n\n"}
{"id": "1863799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863799", "title": "La Convivencia", "text": "La Convivencia\n\nLa Convivencia (, \"The Coexistence\") is an academic hypothesis regarding the period of Spanish history from the Muslim Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the early eighth century until the expulsion of the Jews in 1492. It claims that in the different Moorish Iberian kingdoms, the Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in relative peace. According to this interpretation of history, this period of religious diversity differs from later Spanish and Portuguese history when - as a result of expulsions and forced conversions - Catholicism became the sole religion in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nHowever, some voices have challenged the historicity of the above view of the supposed intercultural harmony as a \"myth\", with the argument that it depends too strongly on unreliable documentation. \"[C]ontemporary ecumenicists appeal to the 'Golden Age' of tolerance\" in the 10th and 11th centuries in Córdoba under Muslim rule, but, for the most part, they are not interested in what actually happened among the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Rather, they mention \"tolerance\", a concept that \"would have had little or no meaning\" at that time.\n\n\"La Convivencia\" often refers to the interplay of cultural ideas between the three religious groups and ideas of religious tolerance. James Carroll invokes this concept and indicates that it played an important role in bringing the classics of Greek philosophy to Europe, with translations from Greek to Arabic to Hebrew and Latin. Jerrilynn Dodds references this concept in the spatial orientation seen in architecture that draws on building styles seen in synagogues and mosques.\n\nAn example of \"La Convivencia\" was Córdoba, Andalusia in Al-Andalus, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was “one of the most important cities in the history of the world.” In it, “Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city.” María Rosa Menocal, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, further describes the libraries of Córdoba as \"a significant benchmark of overall social (not just scholarly) well being, since they represented a near-perfect crossroads of the material and the intellectual.\" \n\nJames L. Heft, the Alton Brooks Professor of Religion at USC, describes \"La Convivencia\" as one of the “rare periods in history” when the three religions did not either keep “their distance from one another, or were in conflict.” During most of their co-existing history, they have been “ignorant about each other” or “attacked each other.”\n\nWhile the Reconquista was ongoing, Muslims and Jews who came under Christian control were allowed to practise their religion to some degree. This ended in the late 15th century with the fall of Granada in 1492. Even before this event, the Spanish Inquisition had been established in 1478. In 1492, with the Alhambra decree, those Jews who had not converted to Catholicism were expelled. Many Jews settled in Portugal, where they were expelled in 1497.\n\nSimilarly the Muslims of Iberia were forced to convert or face either death or expulsion. This happened even though the Granadan Muslims had been assured of religious freedom at the time of their surrender. Between 1500 and 1502 all remaining Muslims of Granada and Castile were converted. In 1525, Muslims in Aragon were similarly forced to convert. The Muslim communities who converted became known as Moriscos. Still they were suspected by the \"old Christians\" of being crypto-Muslims and so between 1609 and 1614 their entire population of 300,000 was forcibly expelled. All these expulsions and conversions resulted in Catholic Christianity becoming the sole sanctioned religion in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nDavid Nirenberg challenges the significance of the age of \"convivencia\", claiming that far from a \"peaceful \"convivencia\"\" his own work \"demonstrates that violence was a central and systemic aspect of the coexistence of majority and minority in medieval Spain, and even suggests that coexistence was in part predicated on such violence\".\n\nMark Cohen, professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University, in his \"Under Crescent and Cross\", calls the \"idealized\" interfaith utopia a \"myth\" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews. This myth was met with what Cohen calls the \"counter-myth\" of the \"neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history\" by Bat Yeor and others, which also \"cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality\". Cohen aims to present a correction to both these \"myths\".\n\nThe Spanish mediaevalist Eduardo Manzano Moreno wrote that the concept of convivencia has no support in the historical record [“el concepto de convivencia no tiene ninguna apoyatura histórica“]. He further states that there is scarcely any information available on the Jewish and Christian communities during the Caliphate of Cordoba, and that this may come as a shock in view of the huge clout of the convivencia meme [“... quizá pueda resultar chocante teniendo en cuenta el enorme peso del tópico convivencial.”] Dr. Manzano attributes the genesis of the convivencia myth to the Spanish philologist Américo Castro (1885-1972). But Castro’s conception “… was never converted into a specific and well-documented treatment of el-Andalus, perhaps because Castro never succeeded in finding in the Arabist bibliography materials suitable for incorporation into his interpretation …”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863804", "title": "Sergio Mora", "text": "Sergio Mora\n\nSergio Mora (born December 4, 1980) is an American professional boxer. He is a former WBC light middleweight champion and was the first winner of NBC's \"The Contender\" series.\n\nRaised without a father, Sergio lived in an East Los Angeles apartment downstairs from the apartment where his mother lived. He boxed as a way to lift him and his family to a better standard of living. Sergio is a class of 1997 alumni of Schurr High School in Montebello, California.\n\nAs an amateur, he had a record of 40 wins and 10 losses, losing on points in the quarterfinals of the 1998 national Golden Gloves, the semifinals of the 1999 U.S. national championships, and in the challengers' bracket final of the 2000 U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nHe is the champion of reality TV show The Contender. The show was structured as a single elimination tournament between middleweight boxers. Mora entered the show with a 12-0 record. On the first fight of the show, Mora defeated Najai Turpin, a contestant who later committed suicide. In the Quarter Finals he was put up against the favored Ishe Smith, beating him to reach the semifinals. He then fought Jesse Brinkley and defeated him after seven rounds, earning a place to box against Peter Manfredo in the final. In the final fight Mora defeated Manfredo in a seven-round unanimous decision to become the show's champion. Months later, he defeated Manfredo by split decision in an 8-round rematch.\n\nIt was rumoured that Mora was to fight WBC and WBO middleweight title holder Jermain Taylor at some point during 2007. However, on March 15, 2007, Mora turned down a seven figure fight against Taylor that would have taken place in Memphis, Tennessee, which Mora felt was too close to Taylor's home of Little Rock, Arkansas. Mora felt that if the fight were to go to the scorecards, the judges would favour Taylor. With only 18 career bouts at the time, Mora also felt he lacked experience to challenge for a world title.\n\nHe was to fight Kassim Ouma (25-3-1 15 KOs) in a middleweight bout on September 15, 2007. It was to be televised on HBO as one of the undercard bouts supporting the main event, Márquez vs. Barrios. However, the event was canceled after Marquez suffered an injury during training. Mora made his return to the ring after 14 months against Elvin Ayala on October 16, 2007 at The Home Depot Center. The 10-round fight ended in a split draw as Ayala outworked Mora in the first half of the fight, but Mora rallied the 2nd half of the fight.\n\nOn January 11, 2008, Sergio Mora stopped Rito Ruvalcaba in the sixth round of their scheduled 10-round middleweight fight at the Casino Morongo. Mora was behind on two of three judges' scorecards entering the sixth round. He hurt Ruvalcaba with a combination, drove him to the ropes and landed another left hand, at which point the referee stopped the fight. Ruvalcaba was still punching at the time of the stoppage, leading to some controversy.\n\nOn June 7, 2008, Mora defeated Vernon Forrest via a 12-round majority decision to become the WBC super welterweight champion. In the build-up to the fight, Forrest threatened to send Mora \"out on a stretcher\" and referred to him as the \"pretender\" (parodying \"Contender\"). However, Mora succeeded in pulling off the upset victory. Forrest took an early lead in what began as a tactical bout, working behind a left jab and landing right hands. Mora started to force his way into the fight in the fourth round, throwing hard punches to Forrest's body and consistently outworking the defending champion. Mora ultimately won a majority decision, with scores of 114-114, 115-113 and 116-112. After the fight, Forrest said that he had taken Mora lightly and cited that he did not train properly for the fight, resulting in his lack of punches thrown in the match.\n\nForrest (41-3) reclaimed his WBC 154-pound title on September 14, 2008, defeating Mora via unanimous decision. Forrest scored a knock down in round seven, had Mora in trouble in round nine and on his back foot for a majority of the bout. Mora had problems making weight for the rematch, having to lose two pounds after failing the initial weigh-in, and after the fight said that he did not expect the quick turnaround on the rematch clause and had needed more time to make the weight properly, resulting in his poor performance.\n\nAfter the two fights with Forrest, Mora made a move up in weight and was to fight then middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik. Pavlik would postpone the bout due to a nagging staph infection. Mora would attempt to keep the fight alive but ultimately it never happened, keeping Mora inactive for almost 2 years. After pulling out of the fight with Mora, Kelly Pavlik went on to lose against Sergio Gabriel Martínez.\n\nOn April 3, 2010, in his first fight in over eighteen months, Mora defeated Calvin Green by 7th-round TKO on the Bernard Hopkins-Roy Jones Jr. 2 undercard. Mora dominated a game Green, fighting with him primarily on the inside landing combinations against him with his quicker hands. He hurt Green several times in the fight, and the ref had finally seen enough after an unanswered salvo of punches from Sergio in the 7th round.\n\nMora fought Shane Mosley on September 18 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The bout ended up being a controversial split draw. The judges' scores were: 115–113 Mora, 116–112 Mosley and 114–114. Boxrec scored the fight 114-112 for Shane Mosley. Punch stats showed that Mosley landed 161 of 522 punches (31%) compared to 93 of 508 thrown (18%) by Mora. The decision was booed by the crowd, who began chanting \"Canelo! Canelo!\" Mosley felt the decision was fair, \"We both fought hard. It was good fight, a good decision.\"\n\nMora's next fight was against fellow Contender participant Brian Vera. The bout was the main-event on ESPN2's Friday Night Fights on February 4, 2011. Mora lost to Vera by split decision.\n\nMora then took a stay-busy fight in November 2011 against Jose Flores, whom he defeated by corner stoppage before the eighth round began. Mora would then rematch against Vera on August 11, 2012. The fight was closely contested, but Mora lost to Vera again via majority decision. Mora had trouble making Vera respect his punching power. The two judges who scored the fight for Vera came under scrutiny as their cards were widely believed to be too wide.\n\nMora bounced back with a unanimous decision win against former world title challenger Grzegorz Proksa, in a fight televised on ESPN's Friday Night Fights. Mora would go on a 5-win streak as he kept busy trying to secure another world title shot. Mora got wins over opponents like Dashon Johnson during this time.\n\nOn February 6, 2015, Mora was scheduled to face IBF titleholder Jermain Taylor on ESPN2 Friday Night Fights for Taylor's middleweight belt in Biloxi, Mississippi. The fight was however canceled, due to Taylor being arrested after an altercation where he threatened a family at the MLK Day parade in Little Rock. Mora fought against Abraham Han on the same scheduled date for the USBA middleweight title. Mora won the fight by split decision, with scores of 115-112, 114-113 and 112-115. Mora was knocked down in round 3 by a left hook, but the referee ruled it a slip. Mora was knocked down once again in round 9, this time receiving a count.\n\nOn August 1, 2015 Mora faced off against WBA (Regular) champion Daniel Jacobs. Jacobs started the fight tentatively, but was able to time and counter Mora with a right hook that put the latter on the canvas. Mora was able to return the favor when Jacobs tried to apply pressure to get a quick stoppage. The fight would then be stopped when Mora retired after injuring his right foot in round 2. After the fight, Jacobs once again said he was looking to fight Quillin.\n\nJacobs went on to defeat former middleweight titlist Peter Quillin. In September 2016, Jacobs rematched Mora. He complained that the fight was a step back for him, as he thought he'd beaten Mora convincingly the first time. On fight night, Jacobs scored two flash knockdowns in rounds 4 and 5 before getting a dominant TKO win. Mora went down three times in round 7 before the referee halted the contest.\n\n\n"}

He is very much proud of his children and his work ethic.\n\nHe was a contestant on reality TV show The Contender, shortly before which he fought future contestant Peter Manfredo and lost. That fight was Manfredo's first defence of the WBO and NABA Light Middleweight Titles. Bonsante had previously won a fight for the vacant IBU Super Middleweight Title.\n\nOn the show, he was placed on the West Coast team and fought Brent Cooper in the sixth First Round fight. He won in his characteristic aggressive style. However, he was meant to fight Jimmy Lange, and an argument ensued over his choosing not to do so - Ishe Smith in particular become infuriated at his conduct. Tarick Salmaci was the only boxer to accept that he had fought well.\n\nAfter running into an uppercut from Jesse Brinkley in the quarter finals despite having had the upper hand with his characteristically aggressive boxing style was knocked into a daze, and found himself flat on the canvas. His feud with Ishe continued as they fought in a Fans Favourite Fight on finals night - trying an illegal move on him before going on to lose.\n\nBonsante fought a rematch with Jesse Brinkley on The Contender Rematch Reality Show. Though the ringside announcers gave the fight to Bonsante, the judges awarded the victory to Brinkley.\n\nIn July 2006, he was beaten by super middleweight prospect Allan Green on ESPN.\n\nHe injected new life in his career on January 12, 2007, with a ten-round unanimous decision win over archrival Matt Vanda for the Minnesota state middleweight title and vacant IBA Americas belt, before a big crowd of 8,872 at the Target Center in Minneapolis. Bonsante dropped Vanda in the tenth on the way to a 98–92, 98–91, 98–91 win. He lost a technical decision to John Duddy on March 16 at Madison Square Garden, after referee Steve Smoger judged him unable to continue after the ninth round due to a cut from an earlier accidental headbutt.\n\nOn July 31, 2008, Bonsante lost a controversial 1st-round KO to Adonis Stevenson when Bonsante was caught with a sharp left just 46 seconds into the first round. Bonsante went down on his back, with his eyes shut. Veteran and WBC appointed referee (Gerry Bolen) began counting but stopped at a count of six as it appeared that Bonsante had been knocked out. As Bolen was waiving off the fight, Bonsante rapidly got up and appeared to be completely alert. Nonetheless, the referee refused to allow the fight to continue. ESPN boxing analyst Teddy Atlas commented that Bonsante may have been playing possum by pretending to be knocked out, but miscalculated the referee's reaction.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, it was announced that Bonsante would defend his Minnesota middleweight title against challenger Andy Kolle at Grand Casino Hinckley on March 27 of the same year.\nAndy Kolle wins by a TKO in round 3 after which Anthony Bonsante announces retirement from the sport.\n"}

Possibly once the site of a monastery, the population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 703, falling to 682 at the Census 2011.\n\nThe 1868 National Gazetteer of Great Britain describes the village as \"\"STOKE-BY-NAYLAND, a parish in the hundred of Babergh, county Suffolk, 1½ mile N.E. of Nayland, and 5 miles E. of Bures railway station. Colchester is its post town. The village, which was formerly a market town, is situated near the river Stour. The parish contains the chapelry of Leavenheath, and had a monastery endowed by the Saxon Earl of Algar, traces of which are still existing. The living is a vicarage in the diocese of Ely, value £278. The church, dedicated to St. Mary, is an ancient structure, with a tower and six bells. There is also a district church at Leavenheath, the living of which is a perpetual curacy, value £56. The parochial charities produce about £25 per annum, exclusive of some almshouses. £8 go towards Lady Windsor's hospital. There is a National school for both sexes. Tendring Hall is the principal residence.\"\" In fact, the earl was called Ælfgar (he was not \"of Ælfgar\"), and it is not known whether the establishment he endowed was a monastery. The relevant charter is Sawyer 1483.\n\nSt Mary's Church was rebuilt in the 15th century and renovated in 1865. The church appears several times in John Constable's paintings, though not always in the right place. The most notable feature is the red-brick tower; completed about 1470 and surmounted by stone spires, the buttresses are laced with canopied image niches. On the north side there is a Tudor porch, but the south porch, the main entrance, was entirely refaced by the Victorians. However, the windows and corbels reveal it to be one of the earliest parts of the church, an early 14th-century addition of two storeys to the building that was then replaced in the late 15th century.\n\nStoke by Nayland's many listed buildings consist mainly of Grade II houses and cottages, mostly timber-framed and rendered with plain-tile roofs, although some are thatched or slated.\n\nThorington Hall in a separate hamlet to the south-east of the village is a 17th-century timber-framed and plastered house with much original detail. There are cross wings at the north-east and south-west ends, and a staircase wing rises to above eaves level on the south-east front. The north-east wing has a jettied gable on both fronts, carved bressummer and bargeboards. The south-west wing has an oriel window on the upper storey on the north-west side, on four shaped brackets. It also includes a jettied gable with carved bressummer and bargeboards. The windows are mostly mullioned and transomed casements with leaded lights, some with the original 17th-century fastenings. There are some original windows, blocked. On the south-east front includes a modern glazed door with an 18th-century door case and a scroll pediment on brackets. There are two heavy chimney stacks, one finely done with 6 grouped octagonal shafts.\n\nDowns Farmhouse, no longer used as such, dates from the early 16th century, with later extensions. It is timber-framed and rendered; with rear extensions partly faced in 19th-century red brick. Of two storeys and on a 3-cell plan, its roofs are plain-tiled with the original chimney-stack set externally on the rear wall of the hall, and a cross entry. The stack has been rebuilt in plain red brick.\n\nStreet House is in Church Street and has a plain-tile roof above timber-framed construction behind a render finish.\n\nThe Maltings, backing onto the churchyard, and the Old Guildhall, facing it across the road, each has exposed timber-framing and jettied fronts designed to be seen. Both these buildings are of four bays divided into tenements.\n\nStoke-by-Nayland contains two schools, one primary, Stoke by Nayland Church of England Primary School, and one independent school, Focus School. The village hall was established in 1911 as the Stoke by Nayland Institute. Now a registered charity the hall is now a general meeting place and hosts variety of events. Stoke By Nayland Hotel Golf and Spa is home to a golf course with two 18 hole courses. The club hosts two international PGA Tour events; the Senior Tour since 2006 and the EuroPro Tour since 2004. James Andrews Golf School moved to Stoke by Nayland Hotel, Golf and Spa in 2018 https://www.jamesandrewsgolfschool.co.uk\n\nThe village is served by buses connecting it to Hadleigh, Polstead, Langham, Colchester, Ipswich, Sudbury, Leavenheath, and Great Horkesley.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 4 acre site aims \"to create an environment that is about healing and sustaining life\". TELA achieved this by replacing the prevalent asphalt with \"permeable, vibrant, shade-giving regional gardens with plants used for healing purposes\", using recycled water to feed these gardens, and most importantly \"connecting people in an urban setting...with the natural beauty of our long ago altered Sonoran Desert\". Beyond the gardens, the site features bike lanes, pedestrian malls, seatwalls, and bioswales that all function to bring people into contact with each other and nature. Upon completion, the project won an ASLA Honor Award in the General Design Category in 2009.\n\n"}

Haifa Bay is Israel's only natural harbor on the Mediterranean.\n\nFed by the Kishon River, the cities of Haifa and Acre mark its southern and northern capes, while its centre is lined with dunes and the suburban Krayot neighbourhoods. Mount Carmel rises from the southern edge, while the mountains of the Western Galilee run up to the shore at the northern boundary. The Port of Haifa lies along part of its southeastern coastline.\n\n\"Haifa Bay\" also signifies one of Haifa's nine boroughs, covering the overwhelmingly industrial area northeast of Downtown and south of Kiryat Hayim.\n\nIn the 1920s, several kibbutzim were established in the Bat Galim neighborhood on Haifa Bay in the wake of British Mandatory budgeting for development of the area. With the coast of Palestine lacking a modern harbor, the British authorities drew up plans for new port facilities. The Haifa Bay Development Company, founded in February 1925 to further these plans, could not recruit the necessary capital, so the transaction was made by the Palestine Land Development Company. The land was purchased from the Sursock family, which had bought it from the Ottoman government in 1872. The 45,000 dunam tract was known as the Jidro lands. The company also acquired a 99-year concession for an additional 12,000 dunams of adjoining land, bringing the total area to 57,000. The land changed hands several times due to financial difficulties, eventually becoming the property of the Bayside Land Company, established in cooperation with the Jewish National Fund. In 1928, the company commissioned Patrick Abercrombie to draw up a development plan.\n\nIn 1934, the Phoenicia glass factory was established in Haifa Bay. The company moved to Yeruham in 1968, and is still operating today.\n\nThe Port of Haifa and a private port operated by Israel Shipyards are located in Haifa Bay. In 2017 they handled a combined total of 32 million tons of cargo, making the port complex one of the largest in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe Bay region is also home to an extensive industrial zone containing various factories, workshops, large shore-based oil refineries, chemical, metals fabrication and power plants and other industrial and storage facilities. The 76-meter high twin cooling towers of the Haifa oil refinery are a nationally recognized icon for the city. For this reason, they have been left intact, though they are no longer actually used since technological advancements in refining have made them obsolete.\n\nHistorically the concentration of industry in the area has also led to pollution of the air, bay and a higher incidence of cancer in the surrounding communities. In response, since the late 2000s decade the Israeli Environment Protection ministry, in conjunction with area industries, have implemented a comprehensive pollution reduction, monitoring and reporting programme for the region. This effort, together with major plants in the region switching from using heavy fuels to natural gas as their primary fuel source starting in 2013 has led to a significant reduction in air pollution. The ministry estimates that between 2009 and 2014 overall air pollution in the Bay area has been reduced by 70%, though the overall concentration of heavy industry in the area means that air pollution is still higher as compared to other regions in Israel.\n"}

{"id": "1863872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863872", "title": "Norse funeral", "text": "Norse funeral\n\nNorse funerals, or the burial customs of Viking Age North Germanic Norsemen (early medieval Scandinavians), are known both from archaeology and from historical accounts such as the Icelandic sagas and Old Norse poetry.\n\nThroughout Scandinavia, there are many remaining tumuli in honour of Viking kings and chieftains, in addition to runestones and other memorials. Some of the most notable of them are at the Borre mound cemetery, in Norway, at Birka in Sweden and Lindholm Høje, and Jelling in Denmark.\n\nA prominent tradition is that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains in order to create a tumulus. Additional practices included sacrifice or cremation, but the most common was to bury the departed with goods that denoted their social status.\n\nIt was common to leave gifts with the deceased. Both men and women received grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount and the value of the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.\n\nThe usual grave for a thrall was probably not much more than a hole in the ground. He was probably buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he could be of use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century. These grave goods not only symbolized status, but also represented key moments or successes within the individuals life. Specific quantities of weapons like arrows could signify the extent of one's military prowess.\n\nThe scope of grave goods varied throughout the viking diaspora, signifying the adaptability of viking funeral practices as they were influenced by these new cultures. While some factors such as animal themed ornamentation amongst jewelry and relics remained universal throughout the viking diaspora, some objects varied on the account of differing cultural influences. A common example being the integration of Christian iconography in jewelry, specifically crosses.\n\nA Viking funeral could be a considerable expense, but the barrow and the grave goods were not considered to have been wasted. In addition to being a homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships.\n\nJelling, in Denmark, is the largest royal memorial from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It was only one of the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones testify to how important it was to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.\n\nOn three locations in Scandinavia, there are large grave fields that were used by an entire community: Birka in Mälaren, Hedeby at Schleswig and Lindholm Høje at Ålborg. The graves at Lindholm Høje show a large variation in both shape and size. There are stone ships and there is a mix of graves that are triangular, quadrangular and circular. Such grave fields have been used during many generations and belong to village like settlements.\n\nThe ritualistic practices of the viking diaspora were incredibly pliable as they adapted in response to temporal, cultural, and religious influences. While traces of pagan funeral practices remained a common thread, many of these practices shifted over time throughout these various regions, especially once Christianity began to rapidly influence the viking population. Recent discoveries at a burial site in Carlisle in the United Kingdom demonstrates a hybrid burial between pagan and Christian traditions, demonstrating the shift in ritual practice as the vikings began to slowly assimilate to these new regions.\n\nDeath has always been a critical moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation at the same time as they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives.\n\nDespite the warlike customs of the Vikings, there was an element of fear surrounding death and what belonged to it. Norse folklore includes spirits of the dead and undead creatures such as revenants and draugr. A supposed sighting of the deceased as one of these creatures was frightful and ominous, usually interpreted as a sign that additional family members would die. The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared. The dead person had to die anew; a stake could be put through the corpse, or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living.\n\nOther rituals involved the preparation of the corpse. Snorri Sturluson in the \"Prose Edda\" references a funeral rite involving the cutting of fingernails lest unpared nails from the dead be available for the completion of the construction of Naglfar, the ship used to transport the army of jötunn at Ragnarök.\n\nSome rituals demonstrated heavy theatrics, glorifying the sacrifices as actors in the greater narrative of the funeral. The funeral ritual could be drawn out for days, in order to accommodate the time needed to complete the grave. These practices could include prolonged episodes of feasting and drinking, music, songs and chants, visionary experiences, consensual sexual acts between couples and in groups, gang rape, suicide, human sacrifice and the mass killing of dozens of animals. Eyewitness accounts even credit women as having key roles in these ritualistic practices, serving as almost the director of the funeral. These performance styled funeral rituals tended to occur within similar places in order to create a spatial association of ritualistic practice to the land for the community. Places like lakes, clearings, or even around large trees could serve as the central location of these rituals. Ultimately, funeral practices were not just a singular act of burying one person. The scope of these practices tended to exceed the burying of just one individual.\n\nThe ship burial is a viking funeral practice traditionally reserved for individuals of high honor. The practice includes the burying of the individual within a ship, using the ship to contain the departed and their grave goods. These grave goods featured decorative ornamentation that far exceeded the extravagance of traditional burials. Additionally, animal remains such as oxen or horses tended to be buried within the ship.\n\nThe ships tended to be ships of pleasure rather than ships utilized for travel or attack. Some ships were potentially chartered for the sake of a ship burial, especially considered they were designed without some necessary features like seats.\n\nThe tenth-century Arab Muslim writer Ahmad ibn Fadlan produced a description of a funeral near the Volga River of a chieftain whom he identified as belonging to people he called \"Rūsiyyah\". Scholars have generally interpreted these people as Scandinavian Rus' on the Volga trade route from the Baltic to the Black Seas, though other theories have been suggested: Anders Winroth has commented that 'the exact identity of the Rus is much debated, and we should be careful not simply to take ibn Fadlan's account of the Rus as in any way representative of Viking Age Scandinavian customs'.\n\nThus some recent scholarship has sought to maximise the case that Ibn Fadlān informs us about practice in tenth-century Scandinavia, while other work has tended to minimise it.\n\nIbn Fadlān says that if a poor man dies, his fellows build a small boat into which they put the body, before setting it on fire. He then gives a detailed account of the burial he witnessed of a great man. In such a case, Ibn Fadlān says that a third of his wealth is inherited by his family, a third pays for the funeral clothes, and a third pays for \"nabīdh\" (an alcoholic drink) to be drunk at the cremation.\n\nThe dead chieftain was put in a temporary grave with \"nābidh\", fruit, and a drum, which was covered for ten days until they had sewn new clothes for him. Ibn Fadlān says that the dead man's family ask his slave girls and young slave boys for a volunteer to die with him; \"usually, it is the slave girls who offer to die\". A woman volunteered and was continually accompanied by two slave girls, daughters of the Angel of Death, being given a great amount of intoxicating drinks while she sang happily. When the time had arrived for cremation, they pulled his boat ashore from the river and put it on a platform of wood.\n\nThey made a richly furnished bed for the dead chieftain on the ship. Thereafter, an old woman referred to as the \"Angel of Death\" put cushions on the bed. Then they disinterred the chieftain and dressed him in the new clothes. The chieftain was sat on his bed with \"nābidh\", fruit, basil, bread, meat, and onions about him.\n\nThen they cut a dog in two and threw the halves into the boat, and placed the man's weapons beside him. They had two horses run themselves sweaty, cut them to pieces, and threw the meat into the ship. Finally, they killed two cows, a hen and a cock, and did the same with them.\n\nMeanwhile, the slave girl went from one tent to the other and had sexual intercourse with the master of each. Every man told her: \"Tell your master that I have done this purely out of love for you.\" In the afternoon, they moved the slave girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her deceased relatives, and the third time she saw her master in Paradise. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young people. She saw that her master beckoned for her. Then she was brought a chicken which she decapitated, and which was then thrown on the boat.\n\nThereafter, the slave girl was taken away to the ship. She removed her bracelets and gave them to the old woman. Thereafter she removed her anklets and gave them to the old woman's two daughters. Then they took her aboard the ship, but they did not allow her to enter the tent where the dead chieftain lay. The girl received several vessels of intoxicating drinks and she sang, before the old woman urged her to enter the tent. \"I saw that the girl did not know what she was doing\", notes Ibn Fadlān.\n\nThen the girl was pulled into the tent by the old woman and the men started to beat on their shields with sticks so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have intercourse with the girl, after which they laid her onto her master's bed beside him. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death looped a rope around her neck and while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife.\n\nThereafter, the closest male relative of the dead chieftain walked backwards, naked, covering his anus with one hand and a piece of burning wood with the other, and set the ship aflame, after which other people added wood to the fire. An informant explained to Ibn Fadlān that the fire expedites the dead man's arrival in Paradise, by contrast with Islamic practices of inhumation.\n\nAfterwards, a round barrow was built over the ashes, and in the centre of the mound they erected a post of birch wood, where they carved the names of the dead chieftain and his king. Then they departed.\n\nThe sexual rites with the slave girl have been imagined to symbolize her role as a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain. While the scholarly consensus assumes that the slave girl would have felt happy and privileged about having sex with lots of people before being killed, recent work has suggested that we should instead see this as an account of rape and \"brutal strangulation\".\n\nIt has been suggested that, by using intoxicating drinks, the mourners thought to put the slave girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic, and that through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead.\n\nThralls could be sacrificed during a funeral so they could serve their master in the next world. \"Sigurðarkviða hin skamma\" contains several stanzas in which the Valkyrie Brynhildr gives instructions for the number of slaves to be sacrificed for the funeral of the hero Sigurd, and how their bodies were to be arranged on the pyre, as in the following stanza:\n\nOccasionally in the Viking Age, a widow was sacrificed at her husband's funeral.\n\nIt was common to burn the corpse and the grave offerings on a pyre. Only some incinerated fragments of metal and of animal and human bones would remain. The pyre was constructed to make the pillar of smoke as massive as possible, in order to elevate the deceased to the afterlife. The symbolism is described in the \"Ynglinga saga\":\n\nOn the seventh day after the person had died, people celebrated the \"sjaund\" (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it involved a ritual drinking). The funeral ale was a way of socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.\n\nSeveral of the large runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which explains how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir after the death of all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.\n\n\n"}

Special signage allowed the LRC to run at higher speeds than normal traffic across a great portion of the Corridor when the tilt system was enabled.\n\nAlthough the last LRC locomotive was removed from service on 12 December 2001, the passenger cars are still in widespread use and form the backbone of Via Rail's services, albeit with the tilt system disabled. The same basic car forms the basis of the Acela Express in the U.S.\n\nAs a vehicle turns it generates centrifugal force, which is proportional to the square of the speed and inversely proportional to the radius. Even a small amount of force, acting across the length of the human body, creates a moment that can make moving about difficult. Centrifugal forces are not normally an issue in an automobile because the occupants are seated, nor in an aircraft where the fuselage is tilted so the centrifugal force passes through the line of the floor. It is primarily a problem in high-speed trains, where passengers and attendants often walk about while the train is moving. The force also pushes the entire train sideways, leading to wear of the outer rail. This was not an issue on early railways where the speed was low, but gained importance as line speeds increased and the radius of curvature became tighter.\n\nOne solution is to place speed restrictions on curved sections of track; another is to bank the railbed on the curve, with the outer rail higher than the inner rail so the net force passes straight through the floor of the coach. Banking the track is known as \"cant\" or \"superelevation\". These measures were gradually adopted on the railways between 1835 and 1860. The use of track cant can only be applied where the speed of the train is fixed in advance. Slower, or stationary, traffic sharing the same line will experience forces pulling inwards, and, conversely, faster traffic will still experience forces pulling outwards. Long experience has shown that, to avoid discomfort on slower trains, track cant should not exceed 6°; and, for trains moving more quickly, cant deficiency should not exceed 4.5°.\n\nDedicated high-speed railway lines were being constructed in Japan in the 1960s. Japan had previously used a but decided to lay entirely new standard gauge lines for these services, the Shinkansen. The lines were designed for a running speed of , using gentle curves with a minimum radii of , and entirely new signalling systems able to provide enough warning to stop a train at within . The Europeans were planning similar systems in several countries, while the UK, and Canada, could not justify such an expense given their passenger numbers.\n\nAnother solution to this problem had been developed in the 1950s but not widely used: tilting trains. Tilting trains rock into the curve to tilt the passenger cars the same way that a superelevated track would tilt them inward. Tilting systems had been introduced in service by the Spanish Talgo, but this system was \"passive\" and took some time to respond to curves. A great improvement can be made by making the system \"active\", reading the forces on the cars with sensors and quickly rotating them to the proper angle using hydraulic rams. British Rail ran an extensive experimental program on active tilt systems in the 1960s that was highly influential, and followed these studies in the 1970s with a new tilting train design, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The technical design objectives for the APT included a maximum speed 50% higher than existing trains, curving speeds 40% higher, all while running on existing tracks within the limits of existing signals.\n\nWhile tilting reduces the problem for the passengers, it does not change the forces on the rails. A train going around a bend at high speed rides up onto the rails, and if the flanges on the inside of the wheels contact the rails they cause considerable wear. Eliminating this effect is difficult, but it can be reduced by lowering the weight of the locomotive, or eliminating the locomotive entirely and distributing the motive power throughout the train. APT took the former route, and the original APT-E used gas turbine power. Gas turbines have an excellent power-to-weight ratio, perhaps ten times that of a conventional diesel engine, with the downside that they use considerably more fuel at idle. This was not a concern when the APT was first being designed, but after the 1973 oil crisis they quickly changed the design to be electrically powered. This was even lighter than the turbine version, but requiring the lines to be electrified at great cost. As a result, only the West Coast Main Line from London to Glasgow Central Station used the electrically powered APT-Ps.\n\nThe only route with passenger numbers and trip times suitable for high-speed service in Canada at the time was the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor, especially the portion from Toronto to Montreal that carries the bulk of the Corridor passenger numbers (about ⅔).\n\nThe TurboTrain, or simply \"Turbo\" as CN preferred, was CN's first attempt to provide higher speeds along the Corridor. Designed in the early 1960s by Sikorsky Aircraft, the TurboTrain used a licensed version of Talgo's passive tilt system and a new turbine-powered locomotive. The CN trainsets were built in Canada by a consortium of Dofasco for the bogies and suspension system, Alcan for the car bodies, and Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) for the engines and power systems. All three companies gained valuable experience with modern passenger train design as a result of the project.\n\nThe Turbo was far from perfect, however. Its articulated bogies meant that the train could only be uncoupled in the maintenance yards. If there was a problem with a single car the entire train had to be taken out of service, and the inability to easily change train length significantly reduced its flexibility. The design featured unique doors at either end to allow two trains to be coupled into one longer one, but in practice this proved too much trouble to be worth it. Moreover, while the turbine power was lightweight and proved very reliable, it was also very inefficient in fuel terms.\n\nA competitor to the Turbo had been brewing for some time at this point. As early as 1966 an engineer in Alcan had been formulating ideas for a new lightweight train and introduced the design to CN. The car body design was made mostly of aluminum for light weight, and built two inches lower than conventional sets to cut down wind resistance. The entire underside and running gear was also streamlined and tight-fitting from car to car to reduce the inter-car gap and the drag that causes. Active tilt in the cars would allow them to take advantage of higher speeds on existing lines, and an advanced suspension design would offer a smooth ride at all speeds.\n\nThe locomotive was based on the ALCO 16-251F prime mover rated at at 1050 rpm. This was the only suitable engine already being built at MLW; it was a relatively old design from the 1950s, and the LRC would prove to be one of its last uses in North America. To keep the train as a whole as streamlined as possible, the loco body was wrapped very tightly around the engine, at the same height as the cars. The resulting design was quite small even by modern standards, several feet shorter than the GE Genesis that replaced them in Via service, and thousands of pounds lighter. The light weight and low wind resistance would allow higher speeds while using less power, improving fuel efficiency.\n\nIn spite of the older engine design, the LRC was a great advance in the state of the art over the Turbo in every way, offering a smoother ride at the same or faster speeds, with lower capital and operational costs, and the ability to easily change train lengths. In January 1967, the two companies approached Dofasco and MLW about the possibility of a new joint venture to develop the design. In December, the group presented their design to Transport Canada, and in January another presentation was made to the Department of International Trade and Commerce to gain funding. The Canadian government's Transportation Development Centre (TDC) outside of Montreal agreed to provide development funding for the technology under the Program for the Advancement of Industrial Technology (PAIT).\n\nThe effort found strong support within the government. The Canadian Transport Commission studied the problem of offering Corridor service and concluded that \"the most profitable strategy to adopt involves maximizing the potential of existing railway facilities through the introduction of new vehicle technology.\"\n\nThe first consideration was whether or not a suitable tilting mechanism could be built into the bogies that would not require extra space or project into the car. Dofasco, a major steel manufacturer in Hamilton, won the majority of the bogie development contracts. They developed a system that consisted of two parts, a bogie and suspension on the bottom, and a separate tilting mechanism on top.\n\nThe suspension consisted of several parts. Between the axle and the bogie frame was a series of C-shaped steel leaf springs stacked inside each other for the basic suspension, with rubber sheets between the leaves providing some shock absorption. A second set of softer springs on top of the bogie provided finer ride quality. Four sets of shock absorbers completed the suspension.\n\nThe tilt controls were developed by SPAR Aerospace and Sperry Rand Canada. The car body rode on rollers fitted into two U-shaped arms at the front and back of each bogie. Hydraulic rams moved the car from side to side along these arms, tilting it up to 8.5 degrees. This made the bottom of the coach slide sideways while it rotated, so that the axis of motion was in the middle of the car body, instead of the top (like the Turbo) or bottom (like most tilt systems). This reduced the feeling of motion on the passengers by keeping the rotation close to their center of gravity, and reduced loads to 0.5g. Each bogie was equipped with its own accelerometer and operated as a completely self-contained unit.\n\nWith Dofasco's successful demonstration of a tilting system, additional contracts were offered to build a prototype train. The name LRC was carefully selected to define the project's goals bilingually; a lightweight train, operating at high speeds, and providing a more comfortable ride than existing trains. Alcan of Montreal won the contract for the aluminum passenger cars and the carbody of the locomotive, while MLW developed the new diesel-electric system.\n\nThe companies had predicted that development of the prototype would cost $2.48 million, and the government provided half of that under the PAIT agreements. The project overran the budget by $77,000, which the companies supplied out-of-pocket. The prototype coach was completed in 1971 and started testing with conventional locomotives. By the summer of 1972, it had seen of service, and a few relatively minor problems cropped up. Issues with the tilting mechanism were studied by a group at SPAR and McMaster University, and several fixes incorporated into the design. By that point the prototype locomotive was 85% complete.\n\nDuring this period, CN executives started expressing concerns about the cost of the equipment, while their engineers stated a preference for electrically powered tilting in place of the hydraulic system. Dofasco stated that such a change would be impractical, upsetting CN. In response, CN requested a series of additional tests, delaying their decision on ordering the design. This was also likely a response to the problems encountered on the Turbo, which had been rushed into service for Expo '67 before rigorous testing had worked out its problems.\n\nWith the PAIT funds exhausted in 1972 and the launch customer delaying its orders, the project went into a lengthy hiatus period where little progress was made. To continue testing without an order from CN, the consortium was forced to turn to the TDC for additional funds. It was not until July 1973 that an additional $460,000 was released to finish the locomotive and start testing. A four-phase program was envisioned to bring the LRC to production. The first two phases would have the coach running on normal mainline service through April 1973 as part of Phase 1, and runs at higher speeds in Phase 2 through to July 1974.\n\nTesting was further delayed due to a railway strike in Canada, which led the consortium to explore moving the high-speed tests to the U.S.'s High Speed Ground Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado. Although a deal was arranged in January 1974, testing continued in Canada. Later that year the consortium learned that the U.S. was considering foreign designs for service with Amtrak, so the contract was revived and the LRC prototype was sent for a six-week period starting in November 1974. The tracks it ran on included butted and welded rail, concrete and wooden ties, and was originally designed to test low-speed urban transport designs at speeds up to . During the testing the train covered at speeds of up to , and routinely took corners designed for at . In one all-day test it averaged including three 10‑minute stops to change crews. The testing was considered a great success by everyone involved, although Amtrak eventually purchased locally made versions of the Turboliner.\n\nWith Phase 1 and 2 complete, additional funding was provided in 1975 to complete the last two phases. Phase 3 started with the LRC entering service on the Toronto-Sarnia portion of the Corridor, replacing the existing Tempos, running on the Tempo's existing schedules and lower speeds. The locomotive ran for another in these tests, and the coach . Simultaneously the last phase, Phase 4, had to demonstrate high speeds on Canadian rails, not test sites. On 12 March 1976 on a stretch of CN line outside Farnham, Quebec, the prototype reached . With those tests successfully completed, the LRC had passed the entire four-phase testing program and was cleared for Canadian service. The total cost for testing, including the funds released in 1973 and 1975, reached $1.1 million. The program as a whole hit $5 million in total.\n\nBombardier purchased MLW in 1975, in part to gain access to the LRC. By this point it had outstripped development of the APT in the UK, and would enter service before it. Although it had a lower top speed than the APT or Japanese designs, it was otherwise considered very advanced. Fuel economy was particularity noteworthy; the LRC used slightly more than with a five-car train, whereas existing fleets used just under , and the Turbo used .\n\nThe monocoque aluminum coaches were also noteworthy; they weighed empty, about one-third less than CN's existing fleet, and were somewhat lighter than the Amfleet coaches being introduced at the same time in the U.S. They were built around two aluminum girders running the length of the car, providing them with the high strength needed to meet the more stringent North American crash standards, while still being competitive with similar designs from Europe. They also included heavy soundproofing, including of foam insulation throughout the body.\n\nThe only major problem with the LRC to come up during development was a continued weight increase of the locomotives. The prototype locomotive weighted , about less than a conventional low-speed loco. However, while development turned into production the weight grew to , eliminating any difference. By 1980, the National Research Council published a report noting that the weight had grown so much that service above would cause unacceptable wear on the Corridor, thereby limiting the new LRC to the same speeds of the Turbo it was meant to replace. Alcan and TDC were also highly critical of Bombardier's management of the MLW portion of the program, suggesting that their mid-level management lacked the know-how to conclude the project rapidly.\n\nWhile work progressed on the LRC, the Canadian government was in the initial stages of fulfilling an election promise made by Pierre Trudeau in 1974 to implement a nationwide carrier similar to Amtrak in the U.S. Although they agreed in principle to buy the LRC in 1975, purchase of the LRC was put on hold while the newly forming Via Rail was set up. CN, which had been wanting to rid itself of passenger service since the late 1960s, started passing off its existing passenger rolling stock to Via starting in 1976.\nIn the meantime, in January 1977 Amtrak signed a $10 million lease agreement for two locomotives with five coaches each, with an option to buy the trains at any time, or return them after the two years were up. Amtrak was in the process of investigating high-speed service on their own Northeast Corridor, especially between New York City and Boston. This portion of the line contained numerous curves, and they were investigating active tilt for at least this portion of the route. The \"LRC 1\" batch for Amtrak was completed in the fall of 1980. They ran in revenue service as Amtrak #38 and #39 (locomotives) and #40 to 49 (cars), where they were used on the \"Beacon Hill\" (New Haven-Boston) and \"Shoreliner\" (New York-Boston) services.\n\nAmtrak declined to take over the trains and they were returned to Bombardier in 1982. There were significant differences between these machines and the later Canadian sets, so they could not be easily mixed. Via used the Amtrak coaches for their International service to Chicago, repainted in Via Rail colours, and renumbered 3501 to 3508, 3511 and 3512. The locos (#38 and #39) were returned to MLW before being scrapped in 1990; the ten coaches are currently parked at Via's headquarters in Montreal. In spite of Amtrak not taking up the LRC design, there was some consideration, even at that early date, of an electric locomotive version of the same basic design.\n\nBy 1978 Via was up and running and they formalized their first order for 10 LRC locomotives and 50 coaches (numbered 3300 to 3349). The total price for the project to this point was $90 million, less than the APT project in the U.K., and less (inflation adjusted) than the successful Metroliner project in the U.S. This order was then expanded for another 10 locomotives. This batch of 20 became the \"LRC 2\" (loco numbers 6900 to 6920). In 1981 they placed another order for 10 locomotives (6921 to 6930) and another 50 coaches (3350 to 3399), the \"LRC 3\" batch.\n\nThe first Canadian production set was delivered to Montreal's Windsor Station on 1 June 1981. The first fare-paying run was made from Toronto to Sarnia on 4 September 1981, on Labor Day weekend. Initially, the LRCs were plagued with problems. One common problem was that the cars would \"lock\" in the tilted position even after the track had straightened out from a curve.\n\nAt the time, Bombardier was estimating total sales of another 80 LRC sets, for up to $500 million. Their calculations showed that the LRC would have a cost per passenger of $23.26 over a trip, only slightly higher than conventional trains. Although the LRC used much less fuel per passenger than conventional sets, even less than a bus, no further sales were forthcoming.\n\nVia Rail put the trains into service, persisting through their initial teething pains and coming to depend on the LRC for the majority of its intercity service in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. The original LRC locomotives were gradually retired after ten to fifteen years of service, although #6905 was used during test runs of the new \"Renaissance\" carriages between Glen Robertson and Ottawa in 2000. The last run of an LRC locomotive was in 2001.\n\nAfter being retired, some of the LRC locomotives were sold to Industrial Rail Services of Moncton, New Brunswick. Some were scrapped and others awaiting sale to museums or operators. Currently, only two known examples have survived into preservation.\n\nMost of the carriages remained in service after the withdrawal of the LRC locomotives, though pulled by newer locomotives, usually P42DCs and often with the tilting mechanism disabled. From 2003 onwards, Via installed wireless internet on all Corridor trains, with distinctive white domes for the satellite downlink being installed on top of the first class cars. A new capital program announced by the Canadian government in October 2007 includes funding for the refurbishment of Via's remaining LRC cars. The tilting mechanisms will be removed as part of this project.\n\nBombardier have since used updated versions of the LRC carriages and their tilt systems in the Acela Express electric high-speed trains they developed for Amtrak in the late 1990s (consisting of 26 club cars and 72 passenger cars), the Super Voyager in the United Kingdom and in the experimental JetTrain recently proposed for several corridors in Canada and the United States.\n\nIn August 2010, The Toronto Railway Historical Association announced that it had successfully concluded the purchase of LRC locomotive #6917 from Via Rail Canada, as part of its \"Save The LRC\" campaign. This locomotive is destined to be placed in The Toronto Railway Heritage Centre museum in the former Canadian Pacific John St. Roundhouse in Toronto, once the necessary money has been raised for the move.\n\nIn addition, LRC locomotive #6921 has been a fixture at the Canadian Railway Museum outside of Montreal for a number of years. It ran under its own power in 2015. \n\n\n"}

After Japan's victories in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95) and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, the U.S. began to regard Japan as a potential threat to its interests in the western Pacific. This antagonism was intensified by Japan's objections to an attempt to annex Hawaii to the U.S. (1893) and by Japan's objections to discrimination against Japanese immigrants both in Hawaii (1897) – on this occasion, Japan sent the cruiser \"Naniwa\" to Honolulu, Hawaii – and in California (1906, 1913). As a result, the U.S. Navy began to draft, as early as 1897, war plans against Japan, which were eventually code-named \"War Plan Orange\". The war plan of 1911, which was drafted under Rear Admiral Raymond P. Rodgers, included an island-hopping strategy for approaching Japan.\n\nAfter World War I, the Versailles Treaty gave Japan a mandate over former German colonies in the western Pacific; specifically, the Mariana, Marshall, and the Caroline Islands. If these islands were fortified, Japan could, in principle, deny the U.S. access to its interests in the western Pacific. Therefore, in 1921, Major Earl Hancock Ellis of the U.S. Marine Corps drafted \"Plan 712, Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia,\" a plan for war against Japan which updated War Plan Orange by incorporating modern military technology (submarines, aircraft, etc.) and which again included an island-hopping strategy. Shortly afterward, a British reporter on naval affairs, Hector Charles Bywater, publicized the prospect of a Japanese-American war in his books \"Seapower in the Pacific\" (1921) and \"The Great Pacific War\" (1925), which detailed an island-hopping strategy. The books were read not only by Americans but by senior officers of the Japanese Imperial Navy, who used \"island-hopping\" in their successful southeast Asia offensives in 1941 and 1942.\n\nThis strategy was possible in part because the Allies used submarine and air attacks to blockade and isolate Japanese bases, weakening their garrisons and reducing the Japanese ability to resupply and reinforce them. Thus troops on islands which had been bypassed, such as the major base at Rabaul, were useless to the Japanese war effort and left to \"wither on the vine\". General Douglas MacArthur greatly supported this strategy in his effort to regain the Philippines from Japanese occupation. This strategy began to be implemented in late 1943 in Operation Cartwheel. While MacArthur claimed to have invented the strategy, it initially came out of the Navy.\n\nLeapfrogging would allow the United States forces to reach Japan quickly and not expend the time, manpower, and supplies to capture every Japanese-held island on the way. It would give the Allies the advantage of surprise and keep the Japanese off balance. The overall leapfrogging strategy would involve two prongs. A force led by Admiral Chester Nimitz, with a smaller land force and larger fleet, would advance north towards the island and capture the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Marianas, going generally in the direction of the Bonin Islands. The southern prong, led by General MacArthur and with larger land forces, would take the Solomons, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, advancing toward the Philippines.\n\nThe principle of leapfrogging was not always followed in the Pacific. When MacArthur moved south to attack Mindanao after capturing the northern Philippines, and when he instigated the reconquest of portions of Borneo, he violated the \"basic tenets\" of island hopping. In the first case, this may have been motivated by MacArthur's promise to return to the people of the Philippines as soon as possible.\n\n\n"}

It is a part of the Selinsgrove Area School District. The school's enrollment has declined from over 1,200 students in 2002 to 849 students in 2013. In 2015, the School enrollment declined further to 789 students. It provides grades nine through twelve. In 2013, 31% of its students qualified for a free or reduced price lunch due to the family meeting the federal poverty level. The school is not a federally designated Title I school. Selinsgrove Area High School employed 58.5 teachers yielding a student-teacher ratio of 15:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 100% of its teachers were rated \"Highly Qualified\" under No Child Left Behind. The school serves an rural-suburban community of 22,259 residents according to the US Census 2013. SAHS is the sole high school operated by the Selinsgrove Area School District.\n\n\nIn 2015, the District’s graduation rate was 86.14%.\n\n\nGraduation requirements are set by the school board in policy and are enumerated in the district's strategic plan. In 2009 the School Board determined that students must earn 28 credits to graduate including: English 4 credits, Math 3 credits, Science 3 credits, Social Studies 3 credits, Health and physical education 2 credits, Graduation project 0.5 credit, Technology 1 credit, Personal Finance .33 credit, Career Awareness 0.66 credit and Electives credits.\n\nAlso essential to graduation is the Pennsylvania state-mandated \"Graduation Project.\" This four-year project often takes on many forms, including entrepreneurship and community service. It is paired with a final paper and presentation to a faculty panel. The panel then decides whether the project is below average, average, or commendable. Students must achieve at least an \"average\" score on all parts of the project in order to graduate.\n\nSeniors and Juniors may earn physical education credits, for graduation, in three ways: scheduling physical education classes in the regular schedule, taking Phys. Ed. by contract, and/or earning a Phys. Ed. by participating in a school sponsored sport. These alternatives are managed by the guidance office. Contract Phys. Ed. students are required to complete a one-page written report and complete 30 hours of a physical activity. In order for students to take Phys. Ed. by contract or sport participation he or she must meet requirements and prerequisites by the high school principal.\n\nBy Pennsylvania School Board regulations, for the graduating classes of 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students’ Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one-third of the final course grade.\n\nMore than 60 courses are offered at Selinsgrove Area High School, including the traditional liberal arts offerings (English, Science, Mathematics, History, Geography, Business) as well as more practical applications, such as Agricultural Science, Family and Consumer Science and Technology. Selinsgrove High has a Music Department which is home to the Selinsgrove Area High School Marching Band and two choruses. Advance Placement courses are offered in several subjects. Students in Calculus, Statistics, and European History have regularly scored 5's on the exam.\n\nThe English and Mathematics curricula are currently under revision to align it with the 1999 Pennsylvania Academic Standards. These standards are assessed in the eighth and eleventh grades under the guise of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment. These tests last several days and cover Reading, Writing, Speaking, Mathematics and Science. Additionally, the school has sought accreditation through the Middle States organization.\n\nScience in Motion Selinsgrove Area High School took advantage of a state program called Science in Motion which brought college professors and sophisticated science equipment to the school to raise science awareness and to provide inquiry-based experiences for the students. The Science in Motion program was funded by a state appropriation and cost the school nothing to participate. The High School worked with Susquehanna University to provide the experiences.\n\nSelinsgrove Area High School Keystone Exams mandated testing results were: 74.7% of students were on grade level in reading/literature and 83% of students demonstrated on grade level in Algebra I. In Biology I 75.9% of pupils demonstrated on grade level science understanding at the end of the Biology 1 course. The requirement that pupils pass the Keystone Exams in reading, Algebra I and Biology I in order to graduate was postponed until 2019 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly because less than 60% of 12 grade pupils statewide would have been eligible for graduation from high school due to failing one or more Keystone Exams.\n\nSelinsgrove Area High School School Performance Profile declined to 71.5 out of 100. The PDE reported that 72.6% of Selinsgrove Area High School students were on grade level in reading/literature. In Algebra 1, 73% of students showed on grade level skills at the end of the course. In Biology I, 69% demonstrated on grade level science understanding at the end of the course. Statewide, 53 percent of schools with an eleventh grade achieved an academic score of 70 or better. Five percent of the 2,033 schools with 11th grade were scored at 90 and above; 20 percent were scored between 80 and 89; 28 percent between 70 and 79; 25 percent between 60 and 69 and 22 percent below 60.

Reflects on grade level reading, mathematics and science achievement. In reading/literature - 79% of pupils were on grade level. In Algebra 1 75% showed on grade level skills. In Biology, just 49% showed on grade level science understanding.\n\nPennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.\nIn 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, SAHS ranked 306th out of 601 PA high schools for test scores on PSSAs. In 2007, the Pittsburgh Business Times ranked the district 235th out of 499 Pennsylvania school districts based on three years of Pennsylvania System of Student Assessment test scores. In 2006, Selinsgrove Area High School was ranked 313 out of 607 Pennsylvania high schools based on PSSA scores combined.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, 136 Selinsgrove Area High School students took the SAT exams. Their Verbal Average Score was 506. The Math average score was 509. The Writing average score was 479.

The research examined course enrollment trends at the state’s 14 community colleges and the 14 institutions in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. The data, provided by PASSHE and the community colleges, showed that during the 2007-08 school year 24.7% of Selinsgrove Area High School graduates required costly remediation in math and/or reading before they could take regular college courses. This was the second highest remediation rate among the IU16 region's high schools. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.\n\nIn February 2012, the school board unanimously voted to change the high school's schedule to make better use of the faculty's time. The new plan includes a universal preparation period at the beginning of each school day followed by four classes. Two day a week a remediation time is added to the end of the school day by shortening each class by 7 minutes.\n\nSelinsgrove uses block scheduling. This method of scheduling divides the day into four blocks, all of which are approximately 90 minutes in length. Full-credit classes meet once per day for an entire semester. Half-credit classes meet every other day for a semester. A total of 27 credits are required to graduate for the class of 2010, and 28 for the class of 2011 and every class after.\n\nIn addition to the traditional bricks-and-mortar format, the school offers alternative education, dual enrollment, technology and job skills training at SUN Area Technical Institute and a program called \"Seals Den\".\n\nSelinsgrove Area High School offers a Dual Enrollment program. This state funded program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. The district has several dual enrollment agreements including with: Susquehanna University, Bloomsburg University and Lackawanna College in Sunbury, PA. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. Students may attend Susquehanna University tuition free, Bloomsburg University at a 75% discount and Central Pennsylvania College at a 75% discount. For the 2009-10 funding year, Selinsgrove Area School District received a state grant of $4,384 for its Dual Enrollment program.\n\nSelinsgrove Area School District students have access to Bloomsburg University's Summer College and Advanced College Experience (ACE) during the summer of their sophomore, junior and senior years (after high school graduation). Tuition is deeply discounted to 75% of the regular student rate. Successful students earn college credits that can be readily transferred to other Pennsylvania public colleges and universities through the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Center (PA TRAC) system.\n\nIn the 2005-2006 School Violence Report to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Selinsgrove Area School District reported 38 incidents including: 8 assaults on students, 7 arrests, 3 ethnic/race intimidation incidents, 8 fights, 1 indecent assault, and 2 incidents involving weapons on school grounds.\n\nThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Selinsgrove Area School District was denied funding in 2006-07 In 2007-08, the High School received $290,116. Selinsgrove Area High School received an additional $52,524 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $342,640. Among the public school districts in Snyder County the highest award was given to Midd-West School District which received $420,699. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget.\n\nThe Selinsgrove Area School District offers a wide variety of activities, clubs and an extensive sports. Eligibility to participate is determined by school board policy. The district permits club sports on a limited basis. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports.\n\nBy Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.\n\nAccording to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.\n\nSelinsgrove's student life programs number in the twenties and include both national and local programs such as French Club, Technology Student Association, Forensics (of the National Forensic League), Chess club, FFA, Student Government, German Club, Key Club, SADD Club, Spanish Club, and Web Heads. Students from the school have been notably successful in participating in Pennsylvania History Day and the Pennsylvania Mock Trial Competition.\n\nStudents can also elect to participate on-stage in Selinsgrove's fall play, spring musical, and spring play. Notable productions in previous years include \"The Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Annie Get Your Gun\", Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", \"Footloose\", \"The Man That Came To Dinner\", \"Jekyll and Hyde\", and \"Copacabana\". More recently, the school has performed shows such as \"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"The Canterville Ghost,\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" They are also set to perform \"Mamma Mia\" in March, 2020.\n\nThe school's music program offers both band instrumental and voice training under a co-curricular policy. Co-curricular applies to those programs that are sponsored or approved by the Board and are conducted both during the regular school day as part of the approved curriculum and partly after the regular school day through approved performances and demonstrations.\n\nThe Selinsgrove Area High School Marching Band supports the community by playing at local events like the annual Memorial Day ceremony and the Market Street Festival. Selinsgrove's band also performs each week at the school's football games; they perform in concert form at least once per semester. The band has played at Canadian football games and marched in several Disney World holiday parades.\n\nThe Honors Chorus has performed at Carnegie Hall and at the dedication of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, DC as the representative of Pennsylvania. The 2005-2006 chorus premiered Matthew Harris' piece, \"Oceanic Eyes\" as well as \"Magnificat\" by John Rutter at Carnegie Hall, and again in 2009-2010 under the direction of choral director Mrs. Katherine A. Bartol.\n\nCoaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid. The sports programs are through the Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. The Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference is a voluntary association of 25 PIAA High Schools within the central Pennsylvania region.\n\nSince 2000, the District has spent millions to add to its high school sports facilities. In a $2.5 project, the high school stadium received a major renovation including the addition of plastic grass and a new track. A soccer field and field hockey field were developed in the lawn areas in the front of the high school building. A small portion of the development was paid for by team booster clubs. A new gymnasium was built as a part of the adjacent elementary school, to provide space for additional basketball programs. Students pay a small - $35 per student activity fee which allows participation in all sports programs and free admission to District sports events.\n\nIn 2008, Selinsgrove School Board added its first club sport - Lacrosse for both boys and girls, stipulating the teams would not receive taxpayer funded support. They are permitted to use the School's name in order to participate in PIAA events.\n\nAccording to Pennsylvania’s Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching.\n\nThe District funds:\n\nAccording to PIAA directory July 2013 \n\nSelinsgrove's Alma Mater was written by Harold W. Follmer, Jr., Class of 1942.\n\nThe students are served by approximately 70 unionized faculty. The majority are considered highly qualified under the No Child Left Behind Act. There are also a variety of classified staff who provide classroom support, clerical services, grounds and building services and food services. The current teachers' union contract is in effect from July 2005 until July 2010. Which expired over 5 years ago.\n\nThe current high school building was built in the 1930s through funding from \"The New Deal\". The building was designed by Lawrie and Green architects of Harrisburg, PA. It is a concrete with steel framing construction, masonry walls and has a red brick exterior.\n\nA two story addition was added to the rear of the building that provides a sizable Media Center, several technology labs, a four office Guidance suite, as well as, science and social studies classrooms. There is a cafeteria, a gymnasium with locker rooms, weight lifting rooms and secondary gym space. Parking is available on all four sides of the building. The Harold L. Bolig Memorial football field and Simon R. Rhoads Memorial Track are located behind the high school building.\n\nhttps://www.dailyitem.com/applause/selinsgrove-students-to-stage-play-that-s-both-comedy-and/article_3a781d82-6c42-11e9-af30-7b0d93fab210.html\nhttps://www.dailyitem.com/selinsgrove-musical-cast-and-crew/article_02699a40-736a-11e9-b2d5-833848b954ba.htm\nhttps://www.dailyitem.com/fall-school-plays-preview-of-eight-valley-productions/article_c47f2cce-e2d0-11e8-a2f6-3325423947cb.html\n"}

{"id": "1863897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863897", "title": "Culture of Norway", "text": "Culture of Norway\n\nThe culture of Norway is closely linked to the country's history and geography. The unique Norwegian farm culture, sustained to this day, has resulted not only from scarce resources and a harsh climate but also from ancient property laws. In the 19th century, it brought about a strong romantic nationalistic movement, which is still visible in the Norwegian language and media. In the 19th century, Norwegian culture blossomed as efforts continued to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music. This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork.\n\nNorway's food traditions show the influence of sea farming and farming the land, traditions with salmon, herring, trout, cod, and other sea food, balanced by cheese, dairy products and breads. Lefse is a common Norwegian wheat or potato flatbread, eaten around Christmas. For renowned Norwegian dishes, see Rakfisk, smalahove, pinnekjøtt, Krotekake, Kompe (also called raspeball) and fårikål.\n\nSeveral Norwegian authors have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, namely Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1903, Knut Hamsun in 1920 and Sigrid Undset in 1928 for \"Kristin Lavransdatter\". Though he was not awarded a Nobel Prize for his plays, as the first of these were awarded after he published his last play in 1899, playwright Henrik Ibsen is probably the most famous figure in Norwegian literature. Ibsen wrote plays such as \"Peer Gynt\", \"A Doll's House\", \"Hedda Gabler\", and \"The Lady from the Sea\". Other famous Norwegian writers from the realistic era include Jonas Lie and Alexander Kielland, who are along with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Henrik Ibsen regarded as the \"four greats\" of Norwegian literature.\n\nAlso of importance to the Norwegian literary culture is the Norse literature, and in particular the works of Snorri Sturluson, as well as the more recent folk tales, collected by Peter Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe in the 19th century.\n\nNorwegian literature attained international acclaim in the 1990s with Jostein Gaarder's novel \"Sophie's World\" (\"Sofies verden\"), which was translated into 40 languages. Other noteworthy writers with an international profile include Erik Fosnes Hansen (\"Psalm at Journey's End\"), Karl Ove Knausgård (\"My Struggle\"), and Åsne Seierstad whose controversial work, \"The Bookseller of Kabul\", was particularly successful in 2003.\n\nNorway has always had a tradition of building in wood. Indeed, many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders.\nIn the early Middle Ages, stave churches were constructed throughout Norway. Many of them remain to this day and represent Norway's most important contribution to architectural history. A fine example is The Stave Church at Urnes which is now on UNESCO's World Heritage List. Another notable example of wooden architecture is Bryggen (the wharf) in Bergen, consisting of a row of narrow wooden structures along the quayside.\n\nIn the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities such as Kongsberg with its Baroque church and Røros with its wooden buildings were established.\n\nAfter Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. Architect Christian H. Grosch designed the oldest parts of the University of Oslo, the Oslo Stock Exchange, and many other buildings and churches.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the city of Ålesund was rebuilt in the Art Nouveau style. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture, but it is only in recent decades that Norwegian architects have truly achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the Sami Parliament in Kárášjohka designed by Stein Halvorson and Christian Sundby. Its debating chamber is an abstract timber version of a Lavvo, the traditional tent used by the nomadic Sami people.\n\nFor an extended period, the Norwegian art scene was dominated by artwork from Germany and Holland as well as by the influence of Copenhagen. It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with even more impressive landscapes. Johan Christian Dahl (1788–1857), originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of west Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\"\n\nNorway's new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland (1843–1914), an early female painter who studied under Gude: Harriet Backer (1845–1932), another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism. Frits Thaulow (1847–1906), an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was Christian Krohg (1852–1925), a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.\n\nOf particular note is Edvard Munch (1863–1944), a symbolist/expressionist painter who became world-famous for The Scream which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man.\n\nOther artists of note include Harald Sohlberg (1869–1935), a neo-romantic painter remembered for his paintings of Røros and Odd Nerdrum, (born 1944), a figurative painter who maintains his work is not art but kitch.\n\nThe oldest Norwegian photograph is from Hans Thøger Winther dating back to 1840. Marcus Selmer is considered to be the first dedicated landscape photographer but Knud Knudsen and the Swede Axel Lindahl are remembered for their extensive travels aimed at capturing landscapes.\n\nFrom the late 19th century until World War I, photographers set up shop throughout Norway. A remarkably large number of women were among them. In 1901, Anders Beer Wilse returned from Seattle and established one of the most famous photographer careers in Norway. Although dominated primarily by German influences in the late 19th century, pictorialism caught on in Norway as it did elsewhere in the world and was promoted by the Oslo camera club, founded in 1921. The pictorialists include Robert Collett, Aage Remfeldt, Thomas Blehr, and Waldemar Eide.\n\nAround World War I, portrait photography in Norway became more of an expressive art as a result of the work of Waldemar Eide, Dimitri Koloboff, Gunnar Theodor Sjøwall, Aage Remfeldt, Hans Johnsrud and Anders Beer Wilse.\n\nIn 1971, the first photographic work (by Kåre Kivijärvi) was accepted at the prestigious Autumn Exhibition in Oslo, marking the widespread acceptance of photography as an art form.\n\nNot until fairly recently has the Norwegian cinema received international recognition but as early as 1959, Arne Skouen's \"Nine Lives\" was in fact nominated for an Oscar. \"Pinchcliffe Grand Prix\", an animated feature film directed by Ivo Caprino and released in 1975, is based on characters from Norwegian cartoonist Kjell Aukrust. It is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time.\n\nThere was, however, a real breakthrough in 1987 with Nils Gaup's \"Pathfinder\", which told the story of the Sami. It was nominated for an Oscar and was a huge international success. Berit Nesheim's \"The Other Side of Sunday\" was also nominated for an Oscar in 1997.\n\nSince the 1990s, the film industry has thrived with up to 20 feature films each year. Particular successes were \"Kristin Lavransdatter\", \"The Telegraphist\", and \"Gurin with the Foxtail\". Knut Erik Jensen was among the more successful new directors, together with Erik Skjoldbjaerg (remembered for \"Insomnia\"). Norwegian artist and filmmaker Ole Mads Sirks Vevle received the critics award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003 for his short film \"Love is the Law\".\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, there have been a number of successful Norwegian films. These include:\n\nAlong with the classical music of romantic composer Edvard Grieg and the modern music of Arne Nordheim, Norwegian black metal has become something of an export article in recent years.\n\nNorway's classical performers include Leif Ove Andsnes, one of the world's more famous pianists, and Truls Mørk, an outstanding cellist.\n\nRegarding pop music, Norway has in the recent years had many international popular artists such as a-ha, Sigrid, Kygo and Matoma.\n\nThe jazz scene in Norway is also thriving; Jan Garbarek, Mari Boine, Arild Andersen, and Bugge Wesseltoft are internationally recognised while Paal Nilssen-Love, Supersilent, Jaga Jazzist, Sturle Dagsland and Wibutee are becoming world-class artists of the younger generation.\n\nNorway has a strong folk music tradition that remains popular to this day. Among the most prominent folk musicians are Hardanger fiddlers Andrea Een, Olav Jørgen Hegge, Vidar Lande and Annbjørg Lien, violinist Susanne Lundeng, and vocalists Agnes Buen Garnås, Kirsten Bråten Berg, and Odd Nordstoga.\n\nNorwegians celebrate their National Day on May 17, dedicated to the Constitution of Norway. Many people wear \"bunad\" (traditional costumes) and most participate in or watch the Norwegian Constitution Day parade, consisting mostly of children, through the cities and towns. The national romanticist author Henrik Wergeland was the founder of the 17th May parade. \"Jonsok\" (St. John's Passing), or \"St. Hans\" (St. John's Day), in June is also celebrated.\nCommon Christian holidays are also celebrated, the most important being Christmas (called \"Jul\" or \"jol\" in Norway after the pagan and early Viking winter solstice) and Easter (\"Påske\").\n\nPhysical culture is important in Norway. With abundant forests and mountain plateaus, and extensive and rivers, Norway has a natural environment which encourages outdoor sports, inclusive of hiking. Many Norwegians own ski equipment, and are active in mountain touring.\n\nNorway has a variety of cultural institutions, including the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, the National Library, and smaller galleries and libraries across the country. In recent years, the Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority has encouraged synergies between the cultural institutions and local municipalities, affecting schools, historical understandings, and community interests.\n\n\n"}

In 1993, Saint John was one of only two ridings in the country to go Progressive Conservative, electing Elsie Wayne. The Conservatives improved their seat count in each election from 2004 to 2011, until the Liberals swept New Brunswick (along with the rest of Atlantic Canada) in the 2015 election.

There was no change elsewhere.\nThe Liberals held three seats in the Anglophone south (Fredericton, Fundy and Tobique-Mactaquac), believed to be most vulnerable to the Conservatives. Despite heavy targeting, the Conservatives only managed to reclaim Fundy from John Herron (who defected from the old PC party in 2003).

{"id": "1863908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863908", "title": "Ceremonial Guard", "text": "Ceremonial Guard\n\nThe Ceremonial Guard (CG) () is an \"ad hoc\" military unit in the Canadian Armed Forces that used to draw principally from the two Primary Reserve (militia) regiments of Foot Guards: the Governor General's Foot Guards (GGFG) from Ottawa (of which it is a sub-unit) and the Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) from Montreal. However, since 2007 the Ceremonial Guard has been staffed by a more pan–Canadian Forces approach: Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force personnel. Every summer, the Ceremonial Guard performs the Changing the Guard ceremony on Parliament Hill and posts sentries at Rideau Hall, the residence of the Governor General of Canada, with the National War Memorial being sentried by the National Sentry Program (NSP), which is carried out by the different regiments in order of brigade throughout the summer until mid-November.\n\nAs with any guard unit in the Canadian Forces, uniforms originate from the Queen's Guard, and rank insignia worn on the uniforms generally follow the pattern currently in force. Members of the CG each carry an unloaded Colt Canada C7 rifle.\n\nThe CG originated from the Canadian Guards regiment, which served in ceremonial occasions for 20 years in the 1950s and 1960s. It conducted its first guard mount on Parliament Hill on 2 July 1959 in the presence of Elizabeth II. Beginning in the early 1970s, the CGG and the GGFG were added to the Public Duties Detachment (PDD) of the Canadian Guards, due to it being reduced to nil strength in 1970. The PDD, which had been based at CFB Rockcliffe until 1985, changed its name to the Ceremonial Guard in 1979, when the unit became mixed sex due to a compromise by the Department of National Defence as a result of a complaint to a human rights commission on the matter that women could not join the guard due to its status as an infantry unit. Since its inception, it has served for over 60 seasons spanning 60 years. In 2020, for the first time since its inception, the summer program was cancelled by order of Canadian Army Commander Wayne Eyre due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.\n\nWhen the Guard joins together, it consists of the following:\n\n\nThe total strength is about 350 people. The uniforms worn represent both infantry guards regiments of the Governor General's Foot Guards (GGFG) from Ottawa, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) from Montreal. The colours carried on Parliament Hill are also from these regiments. The Public Duties Company is further broken down into platoons and divisions. The Public Duties Company has 4 divisions. A division is about 20–26 soldiers. The CG can also form an \"ad hoc\" drill platoon from its ranks.\n\nThe Ceremonial Guard maintains no regimental colour nor has it any battle honours of its own as it is not a permanent unit in the Canadian Forces' order of battle. The only colours flown in the ceremonies are those of the two guards regiments. The unit exists with a full composition only from the end of May to the end of August. During the rest of the year a small administrative corps remains to prepare for next year's public duties season, and beginning in early May the unit stands up partially to allow for the conduct of Basic Military Qualification and other military courses as required. The unit also plans and executes the Canadian Forces beating the retreat \"Fortissimo\". This takes place each year in July in conjunction with the month-long Canada Day celebrations. All members of the Ceremonial Guard are fully trained members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).\n\nThe Ceremonial Guard also maintains its own military band and pipers that form a separate company, as well as the Headquarters Company for administration and support personnel. The members of the Band of the Ceremonial Guard () are made up of musicians from the GGFG and the CGG. Musicians are drawn from military units and colleges or universities across Canada, and applicants must first pass an audition to be considered. All new musicians must pass the Canadian Armed Forces Basic Military Qualification Course (BMQ) before they can be employed with the Ceremonial Guard.\n\nNotable members of the band include the following musicians:\n\n\nThe primary and most visible function of the Ceremonial Guard is, as mentioned, the Changing of the Guard on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. The Changing of the Guard Ceremony is a parade representing the changing of the guards/sentries posted at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Canadian monarch when in Ottawa, and her representative, the governor general, in her absence. The tradition began on Canada Day in 1959 when the 1st Battalion, Canadian Guards, mounted the new guard on Parliament Hill with its band and corps of drums. The ceremony was so popular that the Ottawa Board of Trade asked for permission from the army to continue the ceremony the following year. A full company of two platoons is employed in daily public duties, with both divisions of one platoon parading as the 'new guard' – those to take over duties at Rideau Hall – and the other platoon of the company split, one division parading as 'old guard', and the other performing sentry duties at Rideau Hall and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for the day.\n\nThe parade begins at the Cartier Square Drill Hall with the drum major, followed by the band, and the two divisions of the 'new guard'. Turning north onto Queen Elizabeth Drive, the parade continues underneath the Laurier Avenue bridge and then turns left onto the ramp leading onto Laurier Avenue (Ottawa). While the New Guard is en route to Parliament Hill the Old Guard forms up behind the East Block with the colour. They set off at approximately 9:46 a.m. with the Pipes and Drums of the Ceremonial Guard leading. They march to the east lawn and move into position, then they await the New Guard arriving. The New Guard makes a right turn onto Elgin Street up to the National War Memorial and onto Wellington Street before the parade arrives on Parliament Hill precisely at 10 a.m. At this time the band begins to play \"The 10 Provinces March\" by Howard Cable.\n\nThe parade marches onto the east lawn of Parliament, with the band centred at the northernmost edge of the lawn and facing south. The old guard is in position on the west side of the east lawn and faces the east block, while the new guard marches to the east side of the lawn and faces west towards the old guard. After the old and new guards are formed from three ranks into two and independently dressed off for proper alignment, the two sergeants of the guard – commanders of the two divisions of new guard – advance to be inspected by the company sergeant-major. Following inspection, the number two division sergeant marches to his position while the number one division sergeant stands still. The new guard is then given the order \"Get on parade\", at which point they advance to the tune of \"The British Grenadiers\" from the band, and form up dressed off the sergeants of the guard. The new guard's persons and weapons are inspected by the company commander, and they are stood at ease.\n\nFollowing the inspection of the new guard, the old guard is inspected. After this inspection, the sergeants of the guard and division seconds-in-command are ordered to 'take post' – the sergeant of the guard marches from the right flank to directly behind the guard, while the second-in-command marches from the left flank to the right. The parade is then called to the present arms for the marching on of the regimental colours (If the governor general is currently in residence at Rideau Hall, the officers wear a gold sash and march on the Queen's Colour). With the colours marched on, the new guard advances at the slow march, ceremonially 'taking up the ground' from the old guard. The old guard and new guard salute each other at present arms. Following this, the old guard commander presents the key to the Guard Room at Rideau Hall to the new guard commander. The parade is then formed into three ranks and marched off at the slow march, transitioning into the quick march. The order of march differs only in that the old guard is now at the rear.\n\nThe other highly visible public duty of the Ceremonial Guard is sentry duty at Rideau Hall, as the Canadian War Memorial is sentried by the National Sentry Program. The sentries are ceremonial in nature only and do not generally perform actual guard duty; however, all are trained military personnel and procedures and orders do exist for the Ceremonial Guard to adopt an armed night guard of Rideau Hall should sufficient security threat arise. The sentries at the tomb are part of National Sentry Program (April 9–November 11) of which the CG organizes.\n\nThe sentries are posted daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EDT, every hour on the hour. At 9 a.m. the posting non-commissioned member (NCO) – generally a sergeant or a master corporal but sometimes a corporal from the ranks – marches out accompanied by the two sentries, two escorts, and a bagpiper. The posting NCO, sentries, and escorts are all dressed in full scarlet uniforms and carry rifles with bayonets fixed. The party marches to the Sussex Drive gate of Rideau Hall where the first two sentries are posted and have their duties read to them. The party then marches back to Rideau Hall itself where the two remaining sentries are posted and have their duties read. It should also be noted that the sentries may change more often due to weather issues; e.g. on an extremely hot day.\n\nThroughout the day Rideau Hall is visited by the officer commanding of the parade and the company sergeant-major. They will generally elect to observe a relief of the sentries, and sometimes the officer commanding will take a report from the sentries on duty. The officer and the guard sergeant for Rideau Hall may also elect to do rounds to check on both of the sentry posts. Grand rounds may also be executed by the commanding officer of the unit.\n\nIn addition to the Changing of the Guard, the Ceremonial Guard takes part in many other functions, such as the annual Governor General's review of the Guard. This inspection takes place prior to the first Guard mount on Parliament Hill normally in late June, the Canada Day celebration (specifically the noon show) on 1 July, the \"Fortissimo\" Sunset Ceremony that takes place in late July or early August on Parliament Hill, and the Guard's final parade, Trooping the Colour, at the end of August. It also participates in military funerals (for example, Jack Layton's procession at Parliament), important visits (Queen Elizabeth II in 2010, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011). The Band of the Ceremonial Guard has many engagements outside of public duties. The Ceremonial Guard's main mission and focus is in Ottawa, the capital city. In between their turns, alongside the regiments forming up the Ceremonial Guard, the Ontario and Quebec area CAF personnel from the Army Primary Reserve regiments stationed in their respective provinces, alongside those from other provinces of the country, handle the guard changing duties only at the National War Memorial, reinforced by the Canadian Rangers and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as part of the aforementioned National Sentry Program of the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\n\n"}

It operated regular and charter flights to destinations in Europe and the Caribbean, scheduled domestic services, and scheduled international services to Havana. In its 14-year history, Orbest Orizonia flew to four continents and operated routes to over 30 countries. Its main base was Palma de Mallorca Airport. Orbest Orizonia was the air division of the Orizonia Group, Spain's third largest tour operator.\n\nFollowing the failure of BCM Airlines, Iberworld was founded by Iberostar, a Spanish tourist company, who wholly owned the new airline. Grupo Iberostar already owned a tour operator, Holiday resorts and hotels, and saw that buying BCM would be a quick way to acquire an airline. The airline was established in 1998 and started operations on 11 April 1998 with a single Lockheed L-1011 Tristar leased from Classic Airways of the United Kingdom. The L-1011 was used on routes from Palma de Mallorca and Málaga to London. The next day, on 12 April 1998, the first Airbus A320-200 was delivered and it started services to complement the Tristar. By 5 May, a second A320-200 had been delivered and as the end of spring approached, they returned the L-1011 to Classic Airways. By the end of the year, however, Iberworld received two new A320 aircraft from Airbus, allowing them to make a 23.6 million Euro profit in eight months from carrying over 263,000 passengers.\n\nIn February 1999, the airline took delivery of their first wide-body aircraft – an Airbus A310 – 300 from Transavia. Later that year, it received its fifth A320 and placed an order for two more of the type. 1999 was Iberworld's first full year of flying and passenger figures rose to over one million, the growth being so considerable due to the gap in the market left by Viva Air (which stopped operations in March 1999). This airline closure allowed Iberworld to open new routes to the Caribbean. In 2000, Iberworld's growth was more modest, with passenger figures rising to 1.1 million with no new aircraft arriving. Iberworld then placed their first order for a new wide-body in July 2001, an Airbus A330-200 to serve its long-haul destinations. Later that same year, the two A320s on order arrived; however, due to the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, passenger numbers remained around the same as the previous year.\n\nIn mid-April 2002, the Airbus A330-200 (registered EC-IDB) arrived with seating capacity for 51 Premium passengers and 287 Economy passengers. This acquisition allowed Iberworld to retire the ageing A310-300 in October 2002.\n\nIn 2006, Grupo Iberostar decided to sell the airline and other parts of Iberostar for 800 million Euros while keeping the hotels and resorts. Iberworld, together with former Iberostar's tour operators, and Viajes Iberia became the new Orizonia Group owned by the UK's Carlyle Group (55%), Spain's Vista Capital (36%), the ICG Equity Fund (5%) and ten of the company's managers (4%). Later that same year, Iberworld carried over two million passengers, a major milestone in the airline's history.\n\nIberworld took delivery of three A330-300 series aircraft, the larger A330 variant, another A320-200 (from Iberia) and leased the A330-200 to their Portuguese subsidiary Orbest. The modernized Airbus fleet of seven A320-200s, one A330-200 (leased to Orbest) and three A330-300s allowed Iberworld to report a profit every year since inception in 1998. In 2008, the Iberworld fleet paint scheme was changed to a new design deemed more appealing and eye-catching.\n\nOn 1 May 2011, the airline was rebranded and changed its name to Orbest Orizonia.\n\nOrbest Orizonia acceded to judicial protection on 15 February 2013, due to problems in its fusion with the Globalia Group, parent for Air Europa. On 28 February 2013, it was announced publicly that the Spanish travel agency group Viajes Barceló would buy the airline Orbest along with another travel agent chain called Vibo. Orbest previously employed over 800 employees but with this new deal by the Barceló group, the intention was to employ even more people, just over 900 employees. The airline declared bankruptcy on 5 May 2013 and ceased all operations subsequently.\n\nBy the time of ceasing operations, the Orbest Orizonia fleet consisted of the following aircraft:\n\n"}

The highest peak in the area is Mount Huanggang at on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, making it the highest point of both provinces; the lowest altitudes are around . Many oolong and black teas are produced in the Wuyi Mountains, including da hong pao ('big red robe') and lapsang souchong.\n\nThe Wuyi Mountains are located between Wuyishan City of the Nanping prefecture in northwest Fujian province, and the town of Wuyishan within Shangrao city in northeast Jiangxi province.\n\nThe mountains have been listed since 1999 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, for cultural, scenic, and biodiversity values.\n\nThe site has a total area of 99,975 hectares that is divided into four core parts. Three are ecological: the Nine-bend Stream Ecological Protection Area (36,400 ha) in the centre, flanked by the Wuyishan National Nature Reserve (56,527 ha) to the west and the Wuyishan National Scenic Area (7,000 ha) to the east. The fourth, a cultural preservation area, is the Protection Area for the Remains of the Ancient Han Dynasty (48 ha), about 15 km to the southeast of the others. These core parts are surrounded by an additional buffer zone of 27,888 ha. Portions of the Wuyishan National Nature Reserve are more stringently protected, as the Fujian and Jiangxi Wuyishan Biosphere Reserves on the respective sides of the provincial border, under the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.\n\nThe region is part of the Cathaysian fold system and has experienced high volcanic activity and the formation of large fault structures, which were subsequently subject to erosion by water and weathering. The landscape is characterized by beautiful winding river valleys flanked by columnar or dome-shaped cliffs as well as cave systems. Peaks in the western portion of the Wuyi Mountains typically consist of volcanic or plutonic rocks, whereas peaks and hills in the eastern area are made up of red sandstone (particularly in the east) with very steep slopes but flat tops (Danxia landform). Bedrock lithology at Wuyi Shan is dominated by tuff, rhyolite, and granite in the western part. Red sandstone is common farther east. The elevation ranges from 200 m (656 ft) to 2,158 m (7,080 ft). The terrain is rugged with cliffs and high peaks. There are numerous caverns in the mountains, some of which have been explored and opened to the public .\n\nThe Nine-bend River (), about 60 kilometers in length, meanders in a deep gorge among these hills. In most places, it is a slow, shallow stream navigable only by small craft like rowboats and canoes. However, the river narrows at one point to just a few metres but a depth of .\n\nThe Wuyi Mountains act as a protective barrier against the inflow of cold air from the northwest and retain warm moist air originating from the sea. As a result, the area has a humid climate (humidity 80 to 85%) with high rainfall (annual average 2,200 millimeters in the south-west and 3,200 millimeters in the north) and common fogs. Lower altitudes experience annual temperatures in the range from 12 °C to 18 °C.\n\nThe area is relatively pollution free. The Chinese government set up its first air-quality monitoring station in the area on January 31, 2005.\n\nLower elevations have a humid subtropical climate with mean annual temperature around 18 °C (64 °F) and mean annual precipitation of at least 220 cm (86.6 in). Cooler, wetter conditions prevail at higher altitudes and winters can be snowy on the highest peaks.\n\nThe Wuyi Mountains are the largest and most representative example of Chinese subtropical forests, and of the biodiversity of south Chinese rainforest. The region's ecology has survived from before the Ice Age around 3 million years ago. Biologists have been conducting field research in the area since 1873.\n\nThe vegetation of the area depends strongly on altitude. Broadleaf evergreen forests dominate the lower elevations; their tree species yield to deciduous and needleleaf evergreen trees at higher elevations. It is divided into 11 broad categories:\nMost common are evergreen broad-leaved forests, some of which make up the largest remaining tracts of humid sub-tropical forests in the world. Higher plants from 284 families, 1,107 genera, and 2,888 species, as well as 840 species of lower plant and fungus, have been reported for the region. The most common tree families are beech (Fagaceae), laurel (Lauraceae), camellia (Theaceae), magnolia (Magnoliaceae), Elaeocarpaceae, and witch-hazel (Hamamelidaceae).\n\nThe fauna of the Wuyi Mountains is renowned for its high diversity, which includes many rare and unusual species. In total, approximately 5,000 animal species have been reported for the area. Of these species, 475 are vertebrates and 4,635 are insects. The number of vertebrate species is divided as follows:\nForty-nine vertebrate species are endemic to China and three are endemic to the Wuyi Mountains. The latter are the bird David's parrotbill (\"Neosuthora davidiana\"), Pope's spiny toad (\"Vibrissaphora liui\"), and the bamboo snake \"Pseudoxenodon karlschmidti\" (family Colubridae). Other known endangered species in the area include South China tiger (\"Panthera tigris amoyensis\"), clouded leopard (\"Neofelis nebulosa\"), hairy-fronted muntjac (\"Muntiacus crinifrons\"), Mainland serow (\"Capricornis milneedwardsii\"– a goat antelope), Cabot's tragopan (\"Tragopan caboti\"), Chinese black-backed pheasant (\"Syrmaticus ellioti\"), Chinese giant salamander (\"Andrias davidianus\"), and the golden Kaiser-i-Hind (\"Teinopalpus aureus\" – a swallowtail butterfly).\n\nHuman settlement on the slopes of Mount Wuyi can be traced back 4,000 years by archeological remains. During the Western Han Dynasty, the ancient city of Chengcun was the capital of the Minyue kingdom. In the 7th century, the Wuyi Palace was built for emperors to conduct sacrificial activities, a site that tourists can still visit today. The mountains were an important center of Taoism and later Buddhism. Remains of 35 academies erected from the era of the Northern Song to the Qing Dynasty and more than 60 Taoist temples and monasteries have been located. However, most of these remains are very incomplete. Some of the exceptions for which authentic remains are preserved are the Taoyuan Temple, the Wannian Palace, the Sanqing Hall, the Tiancheng Temple, the Baiyun temple, and the Tianxin temple. The area is the cradle of Neo-Confucianism, a current that became very influential since the 11th century.\nThe Wuyi Mountains have a long history of tea cultivation. The four most widely known varieties of Wuyi rock-essence tea are referred to as the \"Si Da Ming Cong\" ('Four Great Cultivars') teas: Da Hong Pao ('Big Red Robe'), Tie Luo Han ('Iron Arhat'), Bai Jiguan ('White Cockscomb'), and Shui Jin Gui ('Golden Water Turtle'). The Lapsang souchong also originates from the area.\n\nMountain Call and Mountain Open are ceremonies held in the Wuyi imperial tea garden. The county magistrate used to take the chair of the Mountain Call ceremony on Jingzhe Day (). In the formal ceremony, tea planters call out together \"tea, tea, sprout\". By doing this, they pray for blessings in the tea harvest.\n\nThe Wuyi Mountains area is the birthplace of tea-picking opera. Developed from local folk dances and songs, the performances are comedic and focused on daily life in the tea-growing region. Tea-picking opera reflects the strongly rural nature and basics of Hakka culture. This has made it popular in the local area.\n\nSpecial leap-year meals are called Liu Qin () meals. Every leap year and leap month, parents and brothers must invite their married daughters and sisters to return and have meals with their original family. When parents are living, they make the invitation; otherwise brothers do it.\n\nThe number of visitors to the area increased from approximately 424,000 in 1993 to 700,000 in 1998. A raft trip down the Nine-bend River is the most popular activity. Another major attraction is Fuxi Cave, where the narrowest passage – the Thread of Sky – is less than , a fissure open to the surface above. A few hours away is Roaring Tiger Rock, where wind blowing into a cave makes a roaring sound. The nearby Tian Cheng Temple, built in 1707, features a large rock-relief statue of the Chinese goddess of mercy, carved directly into the mountainside. Two more explorable caverns in the area are Ling Cave and Feng Cave. At least one guided-tour company operates combined tours to several of these mountain features. Visitor access to the biodiversity-protection areas in the mountains is controlled.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1863953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863953", "title": "Prljavo kazalište", "text": "Prljavo kazalište\n\nPrljavo kazalište (Dirty Theater) is a rock band from Zagreb, Croatia. Since its formation in 1977, the group changed several music styles and line ups but remained one of the top acts of both the Croatian and Yugoslav rock scenes.\n\nPrljavo kazalište was formed in 1977 in Dubrava, part of Zagreb, the capital of the then SR Croatia. Founding members included: Jasenko Houra (rhythm guitar), Zoran Cvetković Zok (lead guitar), Nino Hrastek (bass guitar) and Tihomir Fileš (drums). Its first vocalist became Davorin Bogović, although they were thinking about taking Davor Gobac (later of Psihomodo pop) instead. All of them, except Houra, previously played in another band called Ciferšlus (Zipper), but after he joined them to form a new group, they opted for the name \"Prljavo kazalište\" (meaning in Croatian language: \"Dirty Theatre\") after an episode of the satirical Italian comic book \"Alan Ford\", which was very popular in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn its early beginnings, Prljavo kazalište was a punk band, although they initially wanted to sound like The Rolling Stones for whom they maintained a great admiration. The group performed live for the first time in 1978 at a gig organized by the magazine \"Polet\" where they were noted for their furious punk image and stage performance. In the same year, Prljavo kazalište released its first single, the punk rock sounding \"Televizori\" for the major record label Jugoton. It featured three songs: \"Televizori\", \"Majka\" and \"Moje djetinjstvo\". In 1979, Suzy Records released their second single \"Moj je otac bio u ratu\". That song was included in the compilation album \"Novi Punk Val\" compiled by Igor Vidmar, along with Pankrti, Paraf and other prominent artists of the former Yugoslav punk scene.\n\nIn 1979, they released their first eponymous album, produced by Piko Stančić, for Suzy Records. It was promoted when the group performed as a support act of the Yugoslav band Bijelo dugme at a concert held at the JNA Stadium. During the recording sessions, Zoran Cvetković left the band and was replaced by Marijan Brkić. The album soon came to prominence all over the former Yugoslav federation for its social commentary and provoked the then-ruling one-party system, additionally because it also featured probably the first gay-themed song in Yugoslavia titled \"Neki dječaci (Some Boys)\" (followed later by \"Retko te viđam sa devojkama\" by Idoli). The authorities valuated the album as \"šund\" (\"kitsch\") and hence they imposed higher taxes on its sale price, while the records considered \"truly artistic\" enjoyed a reduced tax rate. Despite that, the group was not banned and it could freely continue to work and sell records, because non-aligned Yugoslavia was not so strict regarding censorship as the other communist states. Although the band played on the album in a rudimentary manner, the media and the public proclaimed it one of the best debut albums ever released in Yugoslavia. The record sleeve was designed by Mirko Ilić and featured a parody of the famous John Pasche's \"\" design with an added safety pin, representing the band's equal respect for both punk rock and The Rolling Stones.\n\nOn their second album titled \"Crno bijeli svijet\" (\"Black and White World\") released in 1980, Prljavo kazalište affiliated with the new wave music, accepting a more polished image and sound. The album, again produced by Piko Stančić and released for Suzy, was recorded in Milan, Italy. The album included several Ska and Two Tone songs such as the main single \"Crno bijeli svijet\" and \"Mi plešemo\", meaning \"We Dance\", although the original title was supposed to be \"Mi pijemo\" (\"We Drink\"). Also, it featured a cover version of \"Sedamnaest ti je godina tek\" by the notable retro traditional pop singer Ivo Robić. The record was a major success and Prljavo kazalište became one of the leading acts of the former Yugoslav new wave scene (called \"Novi val\" in Croatian).\n\nSoon afterwards, Davorin Bogović left the group. Reasons included disagreements with the other band members or his inability to withstand the pressure of extensive touring and recording, as the band was already in the top of the Yugoslav rock scene and had tight schedules.\n\nIn 1981, the group recorded its third album in the studio of Sjunne Ferger in Sweden. The album was produced by Tini Varga, featuring guest appearances by the percussionists Ferger and Miroslav Budanko and the saxophonist Janne Gustafsson. Since Bogović's departure, this time Jasenko Houra had to take over the position of a main vocalist. With this album, Prljavo kazalište gradually moved on to a more conventional rock, hence achieving great mainstream success across whole Yugoslavia. The album featured a tribute to Bruce Springsteen (the songs \"Heroj ulice\" and \"Široke ulice\") and to Phil Collins in the ballad \"Noćas sam izašao na kišu\". After the release of the record, Fileš and Hrastek were conscripted in the Yugoslav People's Army, so the group performed with the help of the drummer Dražen Šolc and the former member Zoran Cvetković who played bass this time. The latter released a solo album from which one song was included in the \"Vrući dani i vrele noći\" compilation and he later joined the group Dorian Gray in 1982.\n\nIn 1983, Davorin Bogović returned to the band, and sang on their fourth album \"Korak od sna\" released jointly by Suzy and CBS Records, which featured the hit \"Sve je lako kad si mlad\". That was Prljavo kazalište's last record with Bogović and after he left he was replaced as a frontman by Mladen Bodalec, the album's back vocalist, a former member of Patrola. Between others, on this album is song \"Dobar vjetar u ledja\" (\"Good wind in the back\"), which is some sort of homage to legendary Hollywood actor Montgomery Clift.\n\nWith Bodalec, the group released its fifth album \"Zlatne godine\" in the beginning of 1986. This record was pop-rock oriented and it included the successful hits: \"Ne zovi mama doktora\", \"Sladoled\" and \"Ma kog me boga za tebe pitaju\". Unlike their previous Suzy Records albums, this one was signed for Jugoton.\n\nIn 1988, Prljavo kazalište released their sixth album \"Zaustavite Zemlju\" which included several hits such as \"Zaustavite zemlju\", \"Marina\", \"Moj bijeli labude\" and \"Slaži mi\". The album, which was released for Suzy, included the song \"Mojoj majci\" which Houra tributed to his recently deceased mother. At that time, shortly before the upcoming breakup of Yugoslavia, tensions broke out between the constituent countries of the Yugoslav federation, so the issue of an eventual Croatian independence from Yugoslavia started to rise. Hence the lyrics \"Zadnja ruža Hrvatska\" (meaning: \"Last Croatian Rose\") made the song very popular in Croatia, but also criticized in some parts of the rest of Yugoslavia due to (perceived) nationalist undertones, which were considered politically incorrect for the Yugoslav policy of brotherhood and unity. After the album's release, Marijan Brkić left to join Parni valjak and was replaced with Damir Lipošek. The band went on an international tour which culminated with a big open-air show played on October 17, 1989 on the Republic Square in Zagreb in front of approximately 200,000–300,000 people.\n\nIn the following year, the group released its double live album titled after the song \"Sve je lako kad si mlad – LIVE!\". Beside live material from the concert held in November 1988 at the Zagreb's \"Dom Sportova\" and from the performance at the \"ZG Rock Forces\" festival, it included few older studio tracks as well. The record sleeve again featured the band's logo as on the first album but on a black background. During the same year, Prljavo kazalište recorded a new studio album titled \"Devedeseta\" (meaning: \"Ninetieth\", as in 1990), produced by Mate Došen, while the backing vocals were recorded by Davorin Bogović and Vesna Došen. The group also got a new member, the keyboards player Mladen Roško.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1990s, Prljavo kazalište frequently played shows abroad for the Croatian diaspora. During the first years of the Croatian War of Independence, which established the Republic of Croatia as an independent state, the group paused its activities and in 1993 with the new keyboard player Fedor Boić (former member of ITD bend) released the album \"Lupi petama\" for \"InterService\" label with the patriotic war songs \"Lupi petama\", \"Pet dana ratujem, subotom se zaljubljujem\" and others. The group adopted elements of folk music and a traditional tambura orchestra from Vinkovci appeared on their track \"Uzalud vam trud svirači\". The record cover featured a plate filled with bullets.\n\nIn 1994 Prljavo kazalište received the Croatian \"Porin\" music award for this album, but also in other categories as well. In 1995 the group released a new live album recorded at the open-air concert held on Christmas Eve at Dolac Market titled \"Božićni koncert\" (\"Christmas Concert\"). In the end of 1996 the album \"S vremena na vrijeme\" with a luxurious cover came out for Croatia Records, however it didn't bring any fresh ideas. The recorded material was mixed and pre-mastered in London, UK with the help of Zoran Cvetković. The album included a guest appearance by Mel Gaynor, the drummer of Simple Minds.\n\nJasenko Houra formed a record label called \"CBS\" a pun to \"CBS Records\" for whom the group once released an album, and the abbreviation for the band's best known song \"Crno Bijeli Svijet\". In the late 1997 Prljavo kazalište celebrated 20th anniversary by playing a concert with a symphony orchestra at the Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall and released the recordings as a live album titled \"XX Godina\" on Houra's new label. In 1998 the group released its album \"Dani ponosa i slave\", which was the first studio album released after the 20th anniversary. It included guest appearance by the Croatian rap music group Tram 11.\n\nIn the 2000s (decade), Prljavo kazalište released a four audio CD box set titled \"Sve je lako kad si mlad\" (not to be confused with the previously mentioned live album with the same title). Its record sleeve again featured the band's logo, but this time on a white background as it was on the first album. \nIn the end of 2002, Prljavo kazalište signed a contract with Dallas Records which released their album \"Radio Dubrava\" in the following year. In 2003, the band took part in the rockumentary \"Sretno dijete\" which covers the former Yugoslav new wave scene and features many eminent former Yugoslav rock acts from Zagreb, Belgrade and Ljubljana.\n\nIn 2005, the band released the album \"Moj dom je Hrvatska\".\n\nIn 2008, the band released the double album \"Tajno ime\" which was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. The following year a compilation of live recordings \"Best of Live\" and a DVD live album \"XXX godina live\", celebrating their 30th anniversary.\n\nIn 2012, the band released the album \"Možda dogodine\" featuring the guest appearance by Davorin Bogović.\n\nIn 2014, Prljavo Kazalište releases single \"Tamni slapovi\", which announces a new album which will be released in late 2015.\n\nThe book \"\" (\"YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music\") ranked the album \"Crno bijeli svijet\" as the 36th best album released in former Yugoslavia. The songs from the album, \"Mi plešemo\" appeared on the 47th and \"Crno bijeli svijet\" on the 60th place on the 100 best former Yugoslav rock songs selected by the listeners of the Serbian Radio B92.\nThe band was awarded with the Porins for the best album of the year 1994 and best rock albums in 1998 and 1999.\n\nA Polish language cover version of the Prljavo kazalište's song \"Crno bijeli svijet\", translated as \"Czarno-Biały Świat\" performed by Kazik was included in the tribute album titled \"Yugoton\" released in Poland in 2001. The record is a tribute to the former Yugoslav rock scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863967", "title": "SRAM Corporation", "text": "SRAM Corporation\n\nSRAM LLC is a privately owned bicycle component manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, founded in 1987. SRAM is an acronym comprising the names of its founders, Scott, Ray, and Sam, (where Ray is the middle name of the company's first CEO, Stan Day). The company is known for producing cycling components, including some internally developed, such as Grip Shift, EAGLE (1x12), DoubleTap, dedicated 1x11 mountain and road drivetrains and SRAM Red eTap.\n\nThe company grew organically and through acquisitions to become a high-end cycling component brand, selling under the brands SRAM, Avid, RockShox, Truvativ, Quarq, and Zipp. Their components are manufactured primarily in-house, in factories located in Portugal, Taiwan, China, and the U.S., and distributed and sold as Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) equipment and aftermarket components in markets globally.\n\nAs a start-up company, SRAM introduced the Grip Shift (or twist shift) gear-change method and technology to the road bike market in 1988. That technology was then adapted for mountain bikes in 1991.\n\nIn 1990, the company sued Shimano for unfair business practices, noting that Shimano offered, in effect, a 10-percent discount to bicycle manufacturers specifying an all-Shimano drivetrain and that few companies in the highly competitive industry would be willing to forgo such a discount to specify Grip Shift components. SRAM received an unspecified out-of-court settlement from Shimano in 1991. More importantly, all Shimano competitors won the right to compete in the lucrative OEM bicycle components arena.\n\nThe years after the Shimano settlement were marked by dramatic growth for the company, as it increased sales greatly and added other companies to its portfolio. SRAM is an example of a recent trend within the high-end cycle-component segment of the bicycle industry, where companies seek a position as a \"one-stop shopping center\" for bicycle frame manufacturers/bicycle brand owners, supplying all or most of the parts needed to build a complete bike. SRAM now incorporates the former bicycle divisions of Fichtel & Sachs, Sachs-Huret, and acquired component makers RockShox, Avid, Truvativ, Zipp, and QUARQ.\n\nIn 1995, SRAM introduced their first mountain bike rear derailleur, dubbed “ESP”, that featured a 1:1 cable actuation ratio that was more tolerant of cable contamination. The new derailleur was compatible with SRAM's ESP Grip Shifters. This was a critical first step for SRAM toward producing a complete shifting system. By 1997, SRAM was ready to make its first acquisition, Sachs. This acquisition provided SRAM with a group of experienced metallurgists and engineers as well as a successful chain and internally geared hub production line.\n\nSRAM's released its first “X.O” rear derailleur in 2001. It was a complete redesign of SRAM's existing ESP derailleurs, however it still made use of SRAM's proprietary 1:1 shift actuation ratio for improved shifting performance with worn or contaminated cables. Made from forged aluminum, the introduction of SRAM's first high-end derailleur marked a turning point for the company's mountain bike shifting groups. The introduction of X.O also marked the first time trigger shifters were available as a shifting option for SRAM rear derailleurs.\n\nIn 2002, SRAM acquired suspension manufacturer, RockShox, after RockShox had defaulted on a loan from SRAM. In 2005, SRAM developed a new fork damper technology dubbed “Motion Control” that allowed users to adjust compression and rebound of the suspension, including a switch to greatly firm up the suspension. Motion Control was a market success and RockShox continues to use variants of the Motion Control damper on select models.\n\nAvid was SRAM's next acquisition in spring of 2004. Avid produced popular hydraulic disc brakes and gave SRAM one more means to compete with Shimano. Later that same year SRAM purchased Truvativ, a crank, bottom bracket, and chainring manufacturer based out of San Luis Obispo, California. With Truvativ as part of the SRAM family, the company could finally sell a complete drivetrain package to OEM customers.\n\nAlthough SRAM began as a manufacturer of road bike shifters, the company had largely left the road market in 1993 in favor of the rapidly growing mountain bike market. By 2004, SRAM planned a return to the road and began development of two new road groupsets, Force and Rival, which it brought to market in 2006. Force was raced in the Tour de France for the first time the following year. The group made use of a new proprietary shifting technology known as DoubleTap. The technology allows the rider to shift a derailleur in both directions using a single shifter paddle.\n\nIn 2007, SRAM acquired the bicycle component company Zipp. In 2008, SRAM introduced a new premium road groupset, SRAM RED.\n\nSRAM acquired power meter crank manufacturer Quarq in 2011. By 2012, SRAM had incorporated power meters into its high-end RED road group. Also in 2012 SRAM introduced wide range 1x11 mountain bike shifting with its XX1 groupset. The new groupset made use of a 10-42 cassette and a patented single front chainring that made use of both narrow and specially shaped wide teeth to retain the chain without a chain guide. The rear derailleur for the groupset uses a parallelogram that moves only laterally, known as X-Horizon, which is intended to improve shifting precision and chain retention.\n\nBy 2014, this same technology was adapted for use on cyclocross bikes with the introduction of SRAM Force CX1. The group was expanded in 2015 to use chainrings (up to 54-teeth) for other applications such as TT/Tri, road, and fitness bikes. With the expanded applications SRAM simplified the naming of the group to Force 1. The same year the company also developed a lower price point 1x11 road groupset option with similar features, Rival 1.\nIn August 2015, SRAM announced that it would release its 11-speed wireless electronic road groupset, SRAM RED eTap. The group utilizes derailleurs with self-contained batteries to shift using wireless signals sent from the shift levers. Benefits of the system include more precise shifting, faster setup, and lower maintenance compared to a traditional mechanically activated shifting arrangement.\n\nThe company announced a hydraulic disc brake version of its wireless road group called SRAM RED eTap HRD in May 2016. The new brakes make use of a hydraulic lever design with both lever reach adjustment and lever contact point adjustment. In May 2016 SRAM also released their new 1x12 drivetrain technology dubbed Eagle in both XX1 and X01 variants. It has received many awards globally in its first year of public availability from cycling publications due to its simplicity, versatility, and usable rider benefits. The new 1x12 drivetrain has a 500% gear range that is comparable to many 2x drivetrains on the market today. In October 2016 SRAM released the WiFLi version of its eTap rear derailleur which is compatible with a wider range of gears than a standard rear derailleur.\n\nIn 2017 SRAM launched the 1x12 GX Eagle drivetrain, intended to be more affordable than the similar existing Eagle XX1 and X01 drivetrains.\n\nFebruary 6, 2019 SRAM released three new wireless electronic groupsets. This release included one road groupset, RED eTap AXS, and two mountain bike groupsets, XX1 Eagle AXS and X01 Eagle AXS. All of the AXS groups have BLE connectivity and an optional free mobile app called AXS that offers users the ability to reassign and customize button functions.\n\nThe new RED groupset features a 12-speed cassette with wider gear range and smaller steps between gears in addition to many other innovations such as chainrings with power meter integration, a fluid damper for the rear derailleur pulley cage, and both 2x and 1x chainring drivetrain variants.\n\nFor the new mountain bike groups, in addition to their wireless electronic operation, they can also connect with sister brand RockShox’ Reverb AXS dropper post. SRAM's AXS app makes this possible by enabling users to reassign button functions between the Reverb seat post and the XX1 or X01 derailleur controller. The same AXS app also opens the option of using RED eTap AXS drop bar levers with an Eagle AXS drivetrain and a Reverb AXS dropper post. Conversely, drop bar bikes can be simply retrofitted with mountain bike handlebars using the Eagle AXS derailleur controller with RED eTap AXS drivetrain.\n\nSRAM has made significant efforts to support racing through sponsorships made in partnership with race promoters. Examples of this include the Amgen Tour of California, Ironman, the Sea Otter Classic, and Crankworks.\n\nAt the Amgen Tour of California (ATOC) SRAM is the neutral race support sponsor for both the women's and men's races and a title sponsor for the entire women's race. SRAM is also a sponsor of specific stages within the men's ATOC race.\n\nSRAM is the neutral race support sponsor for numerous professional Ironman events including the US National Championships, European Championships, and World Championships. As a title sponsor for the Sea Otter Classic in Monterey, California for roughly a decade, SRAM provides neutral race support for entrants and hosts large product display and technical service tents in the event's expo area.\n\nSRAM is also a supporter of the Crankworks festival held at the Whistler Bike Park in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 90s SRAM Grip Shifters were quickly adopted by triathletes. Grip Shift's aim to allow riders to shift without removing their hands from the bars made the product uniquely suited to the needs of triathletes. These racers needed to maintain an aero tuck with their hands extended on aero extensions, a place where Grip Shifters were designed to perch. It offered both SRAM and the athletes a competitive advantage at a time when there were few aerodynamic shifting options available.\n\nToday SRAM sponsors a number of top triathletes including Ironman World Champ, Jan Frodeno. Other notable athletes sponsored by SRAM include Sebastien Kienle, Javier Gomez, Marinda Carfrae, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, Caroline Steffen, Jordan Rapp, and Non Stanford.\n\nSRAM is a standout among component manufacturers that has consistently assigned equal value to women's cycling. Products and technologies that reflect that commitment to the broad range of female riders’ needs include shifter Reach Adjust, Quarq cranksets available in down to 162.5mm lengths, and 36 cm wide Zipp handlebars.\n\nSRAM is also an ardent supporter of women's professional cycling. SRAM is a title sponsor for the Women's Amgen Tour of California empowered with SRAM. The company also sponsors many top teams in the women's World Tour including CANYON//SRAM Racing, Boels-Dolmans Cycling Team, Twenty20 p/b SHO-AIR, and Rally Cycling Team.\n\nTop female athletes sponsored by SRAM include 2015 UCI Road World Champion Lizzie Armitstead, 2015 UCI Junior Road and Time Trial World Champion Chloe Dygert, 2014 UCI Elite Time Trial Champion Lisa Brennauer, and 2015 Amgen Tour of California empowered with SRAM winner Trixie Worrack.\n\nSRAM has purchased a number of companies, enabling it to offer a full set of components rather than develop them from scratch. At the forefront of the company is the SRAM marque which is used for most of its groupsets. Companies SRAM has purchased and converted into marque brands include Rockshox, Truvativ, Sachs, Avid and Zipp.\n\nIn November 1997, SRAM acquired Sachs Bicycle Components, including a significant hub gear production line, from Mannesmann Sachs AG, a unit of German telecommunications group Mannesmann AG. Sachs had 1,250 employees and annual revenues of more than $125 million. In 2013 production of internal gear hubs moved from Germany to Taiwan. In 2015 the former Sachs Schweinfurt factory was converted for use as a SRAM research and development center as well as a warehouse for European distribution. The remainder of the Sachs company (ZF Sachs) is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen AG. ZF Sachs mainly deals in parts for motorized vehicles.\n\nIn 2017 SRAM announced it would end production of its internal gear hubs due to declining sales, a lack of interest on the part of its suppliers, and competition from e-bikes.\n\nSRAM purchased RockShox on February 19, 2002. They were one of the first companies to introduce a bicycle suspension fork for consumer use. Marketing and sales departments were relocated to Chicago, while product development remained in Colorado Springs. A SRAM factory in Taichung, Taiwan was converted to RockShox production after the acquisition. RockShox is responsible for producing bicycle suspension products including front suspension forks for both mountain biking (MTB) and pavement usage, rear suspension, suspension lockout remotes, maintenance products and a dropper seatpost called the Reverb.\n\nOn March 1, 2004, SRAM purchased Avid, a well-known designer and manufacturer of bicycle brake components. Its current line-up includes mechanical disc brakes, rim brakes, levers, cables and maintenance products for a range of uses including MTB and cyclocross. They also produce two road bike disc brakes. As with RockShox, Avid's product development continued in Colorado Springs while marketing and sales divisions were moved to Chicago.\n\nSRAM purchased Truvativ in 2004 from Micki Kozuschek, providing SRAM with a line of cranks, bottom brackets, handlebars, stems, pedals, seatposts and chain retention systems. This allowed SRAM to offer a complete drivetrain with the first SRAM branded road groupsets being released the following year. Following the acquisition, product development for cranksets and bottom brackets remained in San Luis Obispo, California. \n\nOn November 6, 2007, SRAM acquired Zipp Speed Weaponry, a company designing and manufacturing high-end carbon wheelsets for use on road racing bicycles, as well as other high-end components such as cranksets, handlebars, stems and wheels. The company operates out of Indianapolis, Indiana and produces all of its carbon fiber rims at the company's US factory.\n\nIn 2011, SRAM acquired power meter crank manufacturer, Quarq. Based out of Spearfish, South Dakota, Quarq was founded by Jim and Mieke Meyer. The company is best known for its crank based power meters, but it is venturing out into new areas with its Quarq Race Intelligence product, a live telemetry system aimed at race promoters, race officials, and media. Following the pattern set by other SRAM acquisitions, Quarq continues to operate out of its Spearfish location.\n\nSRAM currently has nine road bike groupsets (in descending order of price):\n\nSRAM currently has 18 mountain bike groupsets, divided by field of application, from more to less expensive:\n\nCross Country:\nDownhill:\nEnduro:\nTrail riding:\nBudget groupsets:\nE-MTB specific:\n\nIn 2008, the company received a strategic investment from Trilantic Capital Partners, formerly known as Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking, the buyout arm of Lehman Brothers. The firm invested $234.8 million in SRAM in a deal that closed Sept. 30, 2008. On May 12, 2011, the company announced in a filing that it intended to raise up to $300 million in an IPO. Shortly later, the company consolidated its debt to pay off the assets owned by the private equity firm. Those plans were put on hold due to volatility in the stock market. SRAM reported net sales of $524.1 million in 2010, and has grown at a rate of about 16 percent annually in the four years prior to 2010. The company has estimated that it holds about 15 percent of the $3.5 billion bicycle components market.\n\n\nThe SRAM Cycling Fund is the advocacy and philanthropy arm of SRAM LLC. The Fund invested $10M over 6 years from 2009 to 2014. Grants for infrastructure at the national levels in both Europe and the U.S. helped leverage co-investment by other cycling industry companies to spur billions in public funding for cycling infrastructure. From 2015 through the present, the Fund continues to support People for Bikes, IMBA, IMBA Europe, and the European Cycling Federation. The Fund also continues to support local efforts near SRAM's US offices as well as Portugal, Taiwan, Australia and Germany.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1863970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863970", "title": "Middlesex and Boston Street Railway", "text": "Middlesex and Boston Street Railway\n\nThe Middlesex and Boston Street Railway (M&B) was a streetcar and later bus company in the area west of Boston, Massachusetts. Streetcars last ran in 1930, and in 1972 the company's operations were merged into the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).\n\nThe company was first chartered as the Natick Electric Street Railway on August 10, 1891. The name was changed to the South Middlesex Street Railway in 1893. That company went bankrupt and a receiver was appointed May 6, 1903; the property was sold on August 15, 1907 to the newly formed Middlesex and Boston Street Railway. By 1910, Boston Suburban Electric Companies, a holding company, had bought the M&B.\n\nIn September 1964 the MBTA began subsidizing the M&B, and route numbers were given to its buses. (According to \"A Chronicle of the Boston Transit System\" (April 16, 1981) the subsidy agreement was signed on December 23, 1964.) The M&B was taken over by the MBTA on July 5, 1972, after a financial dispute over subsidies stopped service on June 30. The routes taken over were renumbered by adding a 5 to the beginning and were renumbered in September 1982 and some in 1996.\n\nThere is one streetcar and one bus preserved from this railway, trolley # 41, a former Lexington car, and bus # 192, a 1948 ACF Brill bus. They are both located at the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\nThe Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway, opened in 1895, was consolidated into the Newton Street Railway on January 1, 1904; the Newton Street Railway was merged with the M&B July 1, 1909. This line ran down the median the entire length of Commonwealth Avenue in Newton, from Norumbega Park at the western end (on the banks of the Charles River) to a connection with the Boston Elevated Railway's Commonwealth Avenue line at Lake Street at the eastern end (now Boston College, at the end of the Green Line \"B\" branch).\n\nNorumbega Park, opened on June 17, 1897, was an amusement park built by the street railway company to increase traffic on the line. The park closed in 1964, long after the streetcar line, M&B's last one, was bustituted in 1930.\n\nIn its final days, this was the 35 Auburndale–Lake Street bus route, until taken over by the MBTA, when it became the 535 Auburndale–Boston College via Commonwealth Avenue. It was not actually picked up by the MBTA in July 1972, when they took over the M&B, but was restarted as a rush-hour only service in January 1973, and discontinued in June 1976.\n\nFrom Bedford, cars left every 15 minutes in the summer, and every half-hour in the winter, for \n\nFare limits were at the town lines of Bedford with Lexington, Concord, and Billerica.\n\nThe line from Lexington ran down Bedford Street and the Great Road, diverting along Loomis Street and South Road to connect with the Boston and Maine Railroad station. A passing track was located on the north side of Bedford Common.\n\nAs at Norumbega, an amusement park was built in Lexington near the Bedford town line, to attract riders from the city. \n\nThe Bedford–Arlington Heights bus, today's 62 (and 62/76) was M&B route 29 and MBTA route 529.\n\nThe car-barn and electricity generator were located in North Lexington north of Bedford Street and just west of the corner of what is now Worthen Road. The complex was composed of at least a long wooden building (the carbarn) and a squat brick structure with a short smokestack (the generating plant); that complex was a lumberyard for many years and was redeveloped in the late 1980s.\n\nA brief history of car lines in Bedford may be found in \"Wilderness Town,\" a book printed for the 1976 Bicentennial (copies at the Bedford Free Public Library).\n\nA photograph dated 1910 of a trolley car passing the Lexington Minuteman statue is on page 104 of a photohistory in the Lexington Room of the Lexington Public Library. The photo is credited to the Lexington Historical Society.\n\nThe Lexington–Woburn line ran from Massachusetts Avenue in Lexington via Woburn Street and Lexington Street to the Woburn B&M station.\n\n27 Newton Corner–Riverside via Auburndale and Central Square Waltham\n\n25 Waltham Center–Lexington Center via Lexington Street\n\nThe Waltham and Newton Street Railway was chartered on July 13, 1866, and began service on August 31, 1868. Its tracks ran from the split between Pleasant Street and Main Street, west of Waltham center, via Main Street, Moody Street, Crescent Street and Moody Street to the Newton line, then via Lexington Street, River Street, Elm Street and Washington Street to end at Highland Street in West Newton.\n\nIn 1889 the Newton Street Railway bought the line, and the Newton Street Railway was merged with the M&B July 1, 1909. It later (by 1964) became much of the 20 Newton Corner–Riverside via Roberts and Central Square Waltham bus line, with the 27 Newton Corner–Riverside via Auburndale and Central Square Waltham using much of Crescent Street (the 20 went straight through on Moody Street). This is now the 553 Roberts–Downtown Boston via Newton Corner and Central Square Waltham, with Crescent Street served by the 558 Riverside–Downtown Boston via Auburndale, Central Square Waltham and Newton Corner.\n\n23 Watertown Square – Stow & Main Street Waltham\n\n36 Wayland–South Natick\n\n"}

It is derived from the plural dative form of the Old Norse word \"flá\" meaning \"plain, flat piece of land\", and it refers to the flood plains of the Flåm River. (\"A plain between steep mountains\" is the toponomy of the encyclopedia \"Store Norske Leksikon\".)\nIn 1670 Flåm Church was built, replacing an older stave church.\n\nIn 1923, the construction of the Flåm Line railway was financed by the Norwegian Parliament. (In 1908, the decision to build the line was made.) In 1942, regular operation of (steam-powered) trains started on the Flåm Line.\n\n\"In the 1960s, cruise ships stayed on the fjord\" [without reaching the port], according to Dagens Næringsliv.\n\nIn 2000, the \"new pier\" was referred to in a government document. (\"The pier was built at the entrance to the new millennium\", according to Dagens Næringsliv.)\n\nThe closest airport is Sogndal Airport, Haukåsen, approximately from Flåm. \n\nThe European route E16 highway between Oslo and Bergen runs through Flåm. The village sits about southwest of the municipal centre of Aurlandsvangen, south of the village of Undredal, and east of the village of Gudvangen (through the Gudvanga Tunnel).\n\nThe navvy road, Rallarvegen stretches from Myrdal down to Flåm. (Pedestrians and bicyclists still use it.) At Myrdal it connects with the navvy road for the previously built Bergen Line.\n\nThe village of Flåm has since the late 19th century been a tourist destination. It currently receives almost 450,000 visitors a year. Most ride the Flåm Line between Flåm and Myrdal, one of the steepest railway tracks at 1 in 18 (not counting rack railways) in the world. There are also a few spirals. A former rail station building in Flåm now houses a museum dedicated to the Flåm railway.\n\nThe harbour of Flåm receives some 160 cruise ships per year.\n\nIn a 2005 Bergens Tidende article, Kjetil Smørås (a hotel director and chairman of Fjord Norge said that \"The cruise traffic pollutes more than several ten thousands of cars, and many of the worst ships sail up here (...) cruise tourists trod down the pristine Norwegian nature, and destroy the foundation for Vestlandet's four entries on Unesco's World Heritage lists\".\n\nIn 2009, Jens Riisnæs (an author and NRK journalist) said \"We have the world's most beautiful nation, we don't need to follow cruise operators' \"premisser\". They can go other places with their polluting ships. It is unwanted noise.\"\n\nIn 2009, Dagens Næringsliv said that a report by \"Vestlandsforskning\" says that both \"Flåm and Geiranger are nearing a limit in capacity. It might be an alternative and rather stand forth as a «relaxed», exclusive and somewhat less of a mass tourism, cruise destination.\"\n\nIn a 2014 Dagens Næringsliv article, a farmer said that \"Previously the smell of summer was that of grass that had been cut. Now [the smell] it is [of] \"tungolje\"\" [\"heavy-oil\"]. Furthermore, \"They [a retired couple] talk about fish that has disappeared from the fjord. In Norway, cruise ships are permitted to dump overboard their greywater in the postcard-narrow fjord-arms. Furthermore, the news article says that defecation in public by tourists, is already a problem; the village's train station has the only public toilets, and 200,000 tourists are expected in the summer season.\n\nIn 2014, tourism professor (\"professor i reiseliv\") Arvid Viken said that \"it is about time this [type of] tourism is evaluated somewhat more soberly than how it has been done in many municipalities for some years\". Furthermore, this tourism \"has low profit per tourist, but is often associated with considerable costs for\" the municipal administrations.\n\nFlåm was the birthplace of the poet Per Sivle.\n\nPart of the book \"The Ship of the Dead\" is set in Flåm.\n\n"}

The 1899 map also shows a branch of the Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway very closely paralleling it.\n\nThe Newtonville and Watertown Street Railway was leased October 1, 1897, allowing it to continue northeast to Watertown. An extension southwest to Needham center was built in 1906. On October 9, 1909, the Newton and Boston was merged into the Middlesex and Boston Street Railway.\n\nThe line was bustituted in 1926. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority began to subsidize the route in September 1964, and assigned it the number 32 Needham–Watertown. When the MBTA took over the M&B on June 30, 1972, it was renumbered to 532. It was again renumbered in September 1982, and is now the 59 Needham Junction – Watertown Square via Newtonville.\n\nThe only changes from the original route to the present day have been at Newton Upper Falls. The original alignment was rather circuitous, looping north of Eliot Street on High, Summer and Chestnut Streets, presumably to avoid steep grades. An alignment in the mid-1970s used a one-way pair, with the northbound direction looping south of Eliot Street. It now uses the old \"northbound\" side (Oak and Chestnut Streets) in both directions, the opposite of the original route.\n\nUntil 20 April 1981, the route only went north from Needham Center; it was extended at that time to Needham Junction. 59A Needham Street–Watertown Square was added in December 1984, running Watertown to Newton Highlands and splitting there onto its own alignment to the Needham Industrial Park. 59A service was merged into 59 in December 1989, with alternate weekday trips using the 59A alignment (and continuing to Newton Junction).\n\nThe branch to Newton Centre split from the main route (on Walnut Street), heading east on Homer Street. It turned south on Centre Street, southeast on Willow Street, south on Sumner Street, and west on Beacon Street, ending at Centre Street.\n\n"}

{"id": "1863995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863995", "title": "Acts of Philip", "text": "Acts of Philip\n\nThe Greek Acts of Philip (Acta Philippi) is an unorthodox episodic apocryphal book of acts from the mid-to-late fourth century, originally in fifteen separate \"acta\", that gives an accounting of the miraculous acts performed by the Apostle Philip, with overtones of the heroic romance.\nThe \"Acts of Philip\" is most completely represented by a text discovered in 1974 by François Bovon and Bertrand Bouvier in the library of Xenophontos monastery on Mount Athos in Greece. The manuscript dates from the fourteenth century but its language identifies it as a copy of a fourth-century original. Many of the narratives in the manuscript were already known from other sources, but some were hitherto unknown.\n\nBovon at first suggested that the text's character named Mariamne may be identical to Mary Magdalene. However, following the Discovery Channel's popularized speculations in \"The Lost Tomb of Jesus\", Bovon publicly distanced himself from its claims, withdrawing his published assertion that the Mariamne of the Talpiot tomb discussed in \"The Lost Tomb of Jesus\" is the same person, writing in an open letter to the Society of Biblical Literature:\nthe Mariamne of the Acts of Philip is part of the apostolic team with Philip and Bartholomew; she teaches and baptizes: Philip baptizes men, Mary baptizes women. In the beginning, her faith is stronger than Philip's faith. This portrayal of Mariamne fits very well with the portrayal of Mary of Magdala in the Manichean Psalms, the Gospel of Mary, and Pistis Sophia. My interest is not historical, but on the level of literary traditions. I have suggested this identification in 1984 already in an article of New Testament Studies.\n\nNew translations of the full text as discovered by Bovon have been published in French, 1996, and in English in 2012. Previous English translations, such as that in M.R. James, are based on the collections of fragments that were known previous to Bovon's discovery.\n\nThe narrative recounts that Jesus sent out a group of followers to spread his message. The followers were Philip, Bartholomew, and a woman named Mariamne, who is identified in the text as Philip's sister, and is a leading figure in the second half of the text. They form a community that seemes to practice vegetarianism and celibacy, and uses a form of the eucharist where vegetables and water were consumed in place of bread and wine. Mariamne wears men's clothes and holds positions of authority comparable to men, serving as a priest and a deacon. Due to this, the Acts have been proposed to be an Encratite text with Gnostic influences, with Mariamne's clothings reaffirming her resistance against the snake of Eden's seduction of Eve.\nThe group travels through pagan lands spreading Christianity by performing powerful miracles, in a series of cycles that has been described to owe \"as much to Christian doctrine, which they try to endorse, as they do to the raw material of Eastern and Mediterranean mythology, which they shamelessly exploit.\" Among their miraculous accomplishments were the conversion of a talking leopard and a talking goat into additional companions, a feat familiar in apostolic acts.\n\nPhillip and his companions are sent by Jesus to preach in the city of the \"Ophianoi\", pagans that worship a race of snakes and dragons. This city, named as \"Ophiorhyme\", is identified with Hierapolis, the site of Phillip's tomb and cult. The group crosses various lands in route to the city while exorcizing monsters, which are revealed to be demons, as well as the offspring of the snakes into which the Pharaoh's sorcerers turned their staffs. After their submission, Phillip turns them into black men in order for them to build a church before disappearing. The group arrives in the city, where the inhabitants attack them and subject them to pagan trials, but they defeat them by working miracles, and ultimately reach the city's gated temple, where the Echidna or mother of the snakes is worshipped. The temple and the monster are then sent to the abyss in a final miracle.\n\nSome of the text's episodes are identifiable as belonging to more closely related \"cycles\". Two episodes recounting events of Philip's commission (3 and 8) have survived in both shorter and longer versions. There is no commission narrative in the surviving texts: Philip's authority rests on the prayers and benediction of Peter and John and is explicitly bolstered by a divine epiphany, in which the voice of Jesus urges \"Hurry Philip! Behold, my angel is with you, do not neglect your task\" and \"Jesus is secretly walking with him\".(ch. 3).\n\n\n\n\n"}

South Australia and Tasmania have a House of Assembly and denote its members MHA.\n\nIn Victoria members can use either MP or MLA.\n\nIn federal parliament, members of the House of Representatives are designated MP and not MHR.\n\nIn Brazil, Members of all 26 Legislative Assemblies () are called \"deputados estaduais\" (). The Federal District Legislative Assembly is actually called Legislative Chamber (), and is composed by \"deputados distritais\" (). Unlike the federal legislative body, which is bicameral, Brazilian states legislatures are unicameral. Members of the Lower House are also called deputies, but they are \"deputados federais\" ().\n\nIn Canada, members of legislative assemblies are members of the elected provincial legislatures and are called MLAs in all provinces and territories, except:\n\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands use the suffix MLA. In 2009 the Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands (which had existed since the 1840s) was replaced with the new Legislative Assembly. As a result, Members of the Legislative Assembly are often still referred to as Councillors.\n\nMembers of Hong Kong Legislative Council are referred to as Legco Councillors.\n\nOut of the 28 states and 9 Union Territories of India, there is a legislature in all the 28 states and 2 Union Territories (Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir (Union Territory) ).\n\nA person, provided he is qualified, is elected as an MLA on the basis of universal adult suffrage by an electorate consisting of all citizens above the age of 18 of that state or UT. In some states, the Governor may appoint 1 member to represent minorities, e.g. the Anglo-Indian community, if he finds that minority inadequately represented in the Legislative Assembly. Those elected or nominated (by the Governors) to Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) are referred to as Members of Legislative Assembly or MLAs.\n\nEach legislative constituency of the State or UT is represented by only one MLA. As outlined in the Constitution of India, the number of legislative seats in a legislature cannot be more than 500 members and fewer than 60 members. However, with an Act of Parliament, the seats can be fewer than 60, as such is the case in the states of Goa, Sikkim, Mizoram and the UT of Puducherry.\n\nDepending on the population and other factors, each State or UT has varying numbers of MLAs, the highest being in the state of Uttar Pradesh (403) and the least in the UT of Puducherry (30).\n\nOwing to parliamentary democracy, wherein some members of the legislature also act as the executive, some MLAs may have triple responsibilities: as an MLA, as a cabinet minister of a department and/or as a chief minister of that state.\n\nMembers of a state legislative assembly comprises elected representatives from single-member constituencies during state elections through the first-past-the-post system. The majority party in each assembly forms the state government, and the leader of the majority party becomes chief minister of the state. The state legislative assemblies are unicameral, unlike the bicameral Parliament of Malaysia. The hereditary rulers or governors are vested with powers to dissolve their respective state legislative assemblies on the advice of the chief minister. Once dissolved, elections must be carried out within an interim period of sixty (60) days. Usually, state elections are held simultaneously with the federal parliamentary elections, with the exception of Sarawak, and before 2004, Sabah.\n\nMembers of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland are known as MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly).\n\nThe Assembly was suspended on October 14, 2002 but the persons elected to it at the 2003 Assembly Election were called together on 15 May 2006 under the Northern Ireland Act 2006 for the purpose of electing a First Minister and Deputy First Minister and choosing the members of an Executive (before 25 November 2006) as a preliminary to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland. Another election was held on 7 March 2007 and powers were restored to the Assembly in May 2007.\n\nIn the United States of America, state legislator is the generic term referring to a member of the legislative body of any of the country's 50 states.\n\nThe formal name of the legislature varies from state to state. In 24 states, it is simply called the \"Legislature\" or the \"State Legislature\", while in 19 states, the legislature is called the \"General Assembly\". In Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the legislature is called the \"General Court\", while North Dakota and Oregon designate the legislature as the \"Legislative Assembly\".\n\nThe Associated Press guidelines for journalists, refer to legislators as state representatives or state senators to avoid confusion with federal counterparts.\n\nMembers of the Senedd, the devolved Assembly for Wales, are usually known as MSs or \"Aelodau o'r Senedd (ASau).\"\n"}

It was revealed to the public for the first time in 1976 as the PSP (\"Polizei-Selbstlade-Pistole\"—\"police self-loading pistol\").\n\nPrompted by the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre, the German police decided to replace the .32 ACP Walther PP with a similarly sized but more effective 9×19mm Parabellum pistol. The new firearm was to meet the following requirements: chamber the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, weigh no more than , the pistol's dimensions would not exceed 180 × 130 × 34 mm, it should have a muzzle energy of no less than 500 J and a service life of at least 10,000-rounds. The pistol was also to be fully ambidextrous, safe to carry with a loaded chamber (both holstered and concealed in a pocket), and able to be quickly drawn and instantly ready to fire. As a result of a competitive bid the German police forces selected three different pistols into service: the Swiss SIG Sauer P225 (designated the P6) and two German designs—the P7 (officially designated the PSP) and the Walther P5.\n\nSeries production of the P7 started in 1979. Shortly after, the pistol was adopted by the German Federal Police's counter-terrorism unit (GSG 9) and the German Army's special forces formations. The P7 was produced primarily by H&K but also under license by the Greek defense firm Hellenic Arms Industry as well as in Mexico by the \"Departamento de Industria Militar\" (DIM), as a sidearm for general officers and staff. The pistol was also exported to several countries.\n\nThe P7 is a semi-automatic blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blowback system modeled on the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5), which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.\n\nThe chamber has 18 flutes that aid in the extraction process by allowing combustion gases to flow between the fired case and the chamber walls, preventing the case from \"sticking\" to the chamber walls. The drawback of this system is that the breech \"opens\" slightly prematurely to allow the slide to initiate its rearward motion. The high temperature gases cycling through a tube located below the chamber area and above the trigger made the early versions of this pistol uncomfortable, according to some, to shoot after the content of two magazines were fired due to heating. The advantages of this system are a simpler manufacturing process due to the absence of a locking system and a high mechanical accuracy due to the barrel being fixed in the frame; the barrel does not execute any sort of lateral or vertical movement during the operating cycle as with the Browning cam-action systems common to many other locked breech pistols.\n\nThe P7's spring extractor is contained within the slide, while the fixed ejector is a surface on the slide catch.\n\nThe grip of this pistol features a built-in cocking lever located at the front of the grip. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed; thus this lever acts as a safety. The pistol is striker fired. Squeezing the cocking lever with a force of cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by , issued on January 2, 1979.\n\nThe P7 is fed from a single-stack box magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds, which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the heel of the grip. After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker.\n\nThe firearm uses a fixed, polygonal rifled barrel (hexagonal with a 250 mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced through the use of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard.\n\nBetween 1982–1983 the P7 received several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications resulted in the P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available on both sides of the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.\n\nBased on the P7 several other variants were built: the P7PT8, P7M13, P7K3, P7M10 and the P7M7, none of which remain in production. Production of the \"P7\" heel release design ended in 1997 with the KH date coded pistol marked \"P7\" on the Grip and \"PSP\" on the slide.\n\nThe P7PT8 is a dedicated, straight blowback training pistol modified for use with the 9×19mm PT training cartridge (made by Geco) with a plastic bullet (weighing 0.42 g). A \"floating chamber\" adapter is used inside the barrel which enhances felt recoil for use with the special ammunition. The pistols were marked with blue dots on both sides of the slide to differentiate the P7PT8 from other P7 pistols that can chamber lethal ammunition. To date about 200 pistols of this type were produced that are used mainly for simulated firing in enclosed spaces.\n\nThe P7M8 is the P7's counterpart with larger trigger guard, lengthened trigger, heat shield, thumb operated magazine release, larger rear sight dovetail, protruding firing pin bushing and lanyard ring. Production began in 1983 and continued until 2007. A final production run of 500 P7M8 pistols were produced under the AH date code (year 2007). Each is marked on the right side of the slide with X of 500. Other than the slide marking no other features nor accessories were added to the usual kit. To commemorate 25 years of P7 production, H&K offered a limited run of P7M8 \"Jubilee\" edition. Only 500 examples were ever made. Included in the package were a wooden lockable presentation case, P7 challenge coin, and special markings. The slide's top-left radiused edge has the designer's name (Helmut Weldle) and \"1 von 500\" (German, and including the double quotes; it translates to \"1 of 500\" in English) etched onto its surface. The wooden grips were made by Karl Nills and had the H&K logo.\n\nThe P7M13 is the P7's counterpart with a double-stack magazine and a 13-round capacity. This pistol was offered (unsuccessfully) to the US Army. A variant known as the P7M13SD was produced in limited numbers exclusively for German special forces, featuring a longer (compared to the P7M13) threaded barrel and a sound suppressor.\n\nThe P7K3 is a shortened version of the P7 (inspired by the HK4 pistol) that uses straight blowback for operation. This version has a removable barrel and uses a sealed hydraulic recoil buffer in place of a gas cylinder. After swapping out the barrel and magazine it can use .380 ACP (9×17mm Short) or .32 ACP (7.65×17mm Browning SR) pistol cartridges and after replacing the slide, magazine and barrel (with floating chamber insert)—it can also be used to fire .22 LR (5.6mm Long Rifle) ammunition. The hydraulic recoil buffer of the P7K3 is prone to wear and causes a serious problem to operate the gun when it is worn down. Heckler & Koch does not make a replacement part for the buffer. However, there are some commercial buffers available. When the .22 LR slide and barrel are installed, the buffer is not engaged.\nThe slide of the .22 LR has an opening at the front that allows the buffer to be unused when firing the gun. Heckler & Koch provides a special scraper tool for the .22 LR-barrel. The tool is needed to clean the inside of the floating chamber for safe operation. An additional exchange tool is provided for all calibers to screw and unscrew the barrel nut that attaches the barrel to the frame. Both tools can be seen in one of the pictures of the P7K3 on this page. P7K3's are more rare in the U.S. than in Europe and are valued at higher prices especially when they are in good condition.\n\nThe P7M10 was introduced to the American market in 1991. It is chambered for the .40 S&W (10×22mm Smith & Wesson) round and has a double-stack 10-round magazine. With the American market in mind, a variant known as the P7M7 designed to use the .45 ACP (11.43×23mm Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge was also created. However, it remained only a prototype due to excessive costs and complexity of creating such a weapon.\n\n\n\n"}

Lane also holds an associate degree from Florida State University as well as a Bachelor in Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Florida International University, graduating in 1997.\n\nOn September 5, 2006, driving a promotional 2006 Dodge Ram on Florida Route A1A, his driving license having been revoked in a previous incident in North Carolina, Lane crossed a double yellow line to pass two cars, striking head-on the 1983 Yamaha motorcycle ridden by 56-year-old Gerald Morelock, a park ranger at Sebastian Inlet State Park, in the oncoming lane. Morelock suffered extensive injuries, and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nLane turned himself in on Monday, September 21 in connection with the fatal crash, facing charges including driving under the influence and manslaughter, his BAC having registered \"0.192\" at the scene of the crash, more than twice the Florida legal limit of \"0.08\". Gerald Morelock's family filed a lawsuit against Lane and Chrysler. Billy Lane entered a plea of \"not guilty\" the day he was officially charged with the second-degree felony.\n\nThe incident drew a range of responses from the motorcycle community, with some calling for stiffer penalties because Lane was himself a motorcyclist, and others calling for leniency for the same reason.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, Lane was convicted (pleading no contest) on one count of vehicular homicide and sentenced to 6 years in prison, 3 years of supervised probation, and loss for life of his driver's license. In arguing for the maximum sentence, the prosecuting attorney cited speeding violations and a pattern of poor driving on Lane's driving record. A judge had earlier approved a plea deal where prosecutors dropped the felony DUI and manslaughter charges. Prior to the plea deal, Lane had been facing up to 30 years in prison. Lane was incarcerated at the Avon Park Work Camp with a projected release date of 10/20/2014. As of 02/24/2013, according to the Florida Department of Corrections website, he was at the Orlando Transition Center (male facility) and released 09/18/2014.\n\nPreviously, in June 2006, Lane had also been arrested by the North Carolina Highway Patrol and charged with drunk driving. After refusing to take a breathalyzer test at the scene and leaving prosecutors without evidence presentable in court, Lane was found not guilty. Because his license had, however, been revoked in North Carolina, he had lost his right to drive in Florida at the time of the fatal crash.\n\nClosures at his Choppers, Inc. shop at the time of his arrests were coincidental; it had been closed for renovation.\n\n\nAmerican Biker\n\n"}
{"id": "1864037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864037", "title": "Quartier international de Montréal", "text": "Quartier international de Montréal\n\nThe Quartier international de Montréal (QIM) or Montreal's International District is a district of the Ville-Marie borough of downtown Montreal roughly bordered by René-Levesque Boulevard to the north, Notre-Dame Street to the south, De Bleury/Saint-Pierre Street to the east and Robert-Bourassa Boulevard to the west. The \"Palais des congrès\" (Congress Hall) building lying just east of the district is also usually comprised in it. Constructed dispersedly between 1965 and 1985 in place of older colonial housing blocks, the district underwent major urban renewal as a central business district in 2000–2003.\nThe main purpose of the project was to restore the continuity of Montreal's downtown, broken by the gaping trench of the Ville-Marie Expressway since the 1960s, and thus to bridge the following areas:\n\nOther goals included the beautification of the built environment, creation of elegant city squares, showcase of Quebec design and public art, and stimulation of world-class real estate development at the heart of Montreal.\n\nThe completed area of 27 hectares (0.27 square kilometres or nearly 67 acres), 30% of which are in the public domain, spreads on an east–west axis above the Ville-Marie Expressway tunnels. It is bounded by Saint Urbain Street to the east, Saint Antoine Street to the south, University Street to the west and Viger Avenue to the north (plus Saint Jacques Street between McGill Street and University Street). The area is serviced by three stations on the Orange Line of the Montreal Metro and large portions of the underground city.\n\nThe QIM itself has five main components, from east to west:\n\nThe Palais des congrès de Montréal (Montreal Convention Centre), the only building that was originally built over the expressway trench, was extended towards the west in the same manner, doubling in area while covering the first half of the western trench. The extension followed a similar design than the 1980s original, but with less concrete and more coloured glass, giving it a lighter appearance. The design, which included multicoloured panels and bright pink \"tree\" sculptures in the lobby, did not please everyone but is generally said to integrate well with the area. This section is connected to the Place-d'Armes Metro station.\n\nThe public square built over the trench at the same time as the Centre CDP Capital was named Place Jean-Paul Riopelle in honour of Quebec artist Jean-Paul Riopelle who died in 2002. His fountain sculpture \"La Joute\" was then moved to the square from the Parc Olympique in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.\n\nThe Édifice Jacques-Parizeau is the Montreal regional office of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the main investment arm of the Quebec government. Entirely suspended over the trench, the 13-storey building was the \"enabler\" and is now the centrepiece of the district, stretching between Jean-Paul Riopelle and Victoria squares. Despite its strong architectural qualities, construction was marked by opposition to the huge cost overruns of an already very expensive structure, at the same time as the CDP was losing taxpayers' money from questionable investments made during the dot-com bubble.\n\nThe building integrates a new W boutique hotel at the west end on Victoria Square, as well as headquarters of two international organisations: International Council of Graphic Design Associations (Icograda) and the International Council of Societies of Industries Design (Icsid).\n\nOnce an empty space crossed diagonally by Beaver Hall and McGill streets, Victoria Square was restored to its original configuration, that of a tree-lined square between parallel avenues. Trees and benches were added, the statue of Queen Victoria was reinstated, and special care was given to Hector Guimard's Art Nouveau outdoor entrance to the Square-Victoria-OACI Metro station. The square is now fronted on the east by the Centre CDP Capital and the Montreal World Trade Centre, to the west by Tour de la Bourse and Place de la Cité internationale, to the north by the Altoria/Aimia Tower, and to the south by the Quebecor building, its outdated façade fully re-designed for the occasion.\n\nPlace de la Cité internationale, northwest of Victoria Square, is a complex that currently consists of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The modern 17-storey building, completed in 1995, has its main entrance on the west side on University Street. A taller second phase has been announced on the site for quite some time, to fill the void near Tour de la Bourse.\n\nNorthwest of Victoria Square is the Complexe Maisonneuve, made of the two aluminum-clad Bell and National Bank of Canada towers built in 1982. Neighbouring Place Bonaventure, connected to the Bonaventure Metro station, marks the western boundary of the QIM. A tunnel built under University Street between Place de la Cité internationale and Place Bonaventure finally connected the eastern and western parts of the Underground City which had previously been separated.\n\nSidewalks were widened and re-paved in order to increase the pedestrian area by 40%. Open-air parking lots were eliminated and replaced with 1,300 new parking spaces added under the Palais des Congrès, Place Jean-Paul Riopelle, and the Centre CDP Capital. Several trees were planted, and distinctive street furniture and street lighting was installed, including 22 backlit columns adorned with world flags in the median divider on University Street, welcoming southern arrivals from the Bonaventure Expressway.\n\nClément Demers was responsible for overall project design, working with Consortium Daoust Lestage and Provencher, Roy et associés, with engineers Groupe conseil Genivar. Architect and urban planner also consulted on the project.\n\nAs of September 2005, the project had received 22 awards in 13 different domains, including the \"PMI Project of the Year 2005\" from the Project Management Institute of Philadelphia. The project's success played a part in the decision of the World Anti-Doping Agency and International Design Alliance to move to Montreal, joining the ICAO, IATA and several other international organizations. Chef Normand Laprise's world-famous Toqué! restaurant moved from its tiny Saint Denis Street location to the Centre CDP Capital on Place Jean-Paul Riopelle, putting the QIM on the international gastronomy map. The district has become a prestigious address for real estate development, with upscale housing built and under construction totalling approximately 1000 units as of 2005.\n\nThe project was managed by the \"Société du Quartier international de Montréal\", a nonprofit organization created in July 1999 by the federal government of Canada, province of Quebec and city of Montreal, as well as the Caisse de dépôt et placement and the \"Association des riverains du Quartier international de Montréal\" (ARQIM). The initial budget for the project was CAD$76 million (approx. US$57 million); the actual cost was $90 million (US$68 million). According to QIM's management, more than half of the overrun resulted from additional work requested by the city, as well as additional expropriation costs. Total investment in the district from all sources was approximately $860 million (US$650 million) between 2000 and 2003.\n\nCurrent projects include the beautification of McGill Street south of Victoria Square towards Old Montreal.

It is NP-complete but fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded treewidth.\n\nThe monochromatic triangle problem takes as input an n-node undirected graph G(V,E) with node set V and edge set E.\nThe output is a Boolean value, true if the edge set E of G can be partitioned into two disjoint sets E1 and E2, such that both of the two subgraphs G1(V,E1) and G2(V,E2) are triangle-free graphs, and false otherwise. This decision problem is NP-complete.\n\nThe problem may be generalized to triangle-free edge coloring, finding an assignment of colors to the edges of a graph so that no triangle has all three edges given the same color. The monochromatic triangle problem is the special case of triangle-free edge-coloring when there are exactly two colors available. If there exists a two-color triangle-free edge coloring, then the edges of each color form the two sets E1 and E2 of the monochromatic triangle problem. Conversely, if the monochromatic triangle problem has a solution, we can use one color for E1 and a second color for E2 to obtain a triangle-free edge coloring.\n\nBy Ramsey's theorem, for any finite number \"k\" of colors, there exists a number \"n\" such that complete graphs of \"n\" or more vertices do not have triangle-free edge colorings with \"k\" colors. For \"k\" = 2, the corresponding value of \"n\" is 6. That is, the answer to the monochromatic triangle problem on the complete graph \"K\" is no.\n\nIt is straightforward to express the monochromatic triangle problem in the monadic second-order logic of graphs (MSO), by a logical formula that asserts the existence of a partition of the edges into two subsets such that there do not exist three mutually adjacent vertices whose edges all belong to the same side of the partition. It follows from Courcelle's theorem that the monochromatic triangle problem is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded treewidth. More precisely, there is an algorithm for solving the problem whose running time is the number of vertices of the input graph multiplied by a quickly-growing but computable function of the treewidth.\n"}

It was established in 1965, and it is located in Belo Horizonte.\n\nIt served as a venue in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It also hosted some matches of the football tournament of the 2016 Summer Olympics. The stadium has a seating capacity of 61,846 spectators. The property of the state of Minas Gerais, it is used by Cruzeiro as its home, with Atlético Mineiro playing some matches in it as well.\n\nThe project to construct the Mineirão predated the stadium's opening by more than 25 years. In the 1940s, a modest movement began, involving managers, entrepreneurs, athletes and journalists. The idea was to build a field in Belo Horizonte to that matched the evolution of Minas Gerais' football up to that point.\n\nThe top three teams in the state capital had their stadiums, but they were cramped, uncomfortable and no longer supported the demand of fans. Stadium Otacílio Negrão de Lima (Alameda Stadium, at Francisco Sales Avenue), of América; Antônio Carlos Stadium (located on Olegário Maciel Avenue), of Atlético Mineiro; and Juscelino Kubitschek Stadium (located on Augusto de Lima Avenue), of Cruzeiro did not support more than 10,000 spectators. Atlético, the team with the wealthiest members in Belo Horizonte, planned to build a stadium for 30,000 people, after the winning the 1937 State Champions Cup. It nearly went out of paper, but then they found a huge club debt, forcing the directors to allot and sell the properties that the club had in the neighborhood where the stadium would be built, Antônio Carlos Avenue, near the airport.\n\nAt the end of the 1940s, journalist Canor Simões Coelho achieved with CBD the inclusion of Belo Horizonte as one of the venues of 1950 FIFA World Cup. For this, the council would have to build a stadium at the height of the event. Official agreement was signed by mayor Otacílio Negrão de Lima and the president of the CBD, Rivadávia Correa Meyer. The modest club Sete de Setembro was in charge of commanding the works of the new field.\n\nThe construction of Independência Stadium was slow and it seemed that would not be completed in time for the World Cup. But with the intervention of the CBD and FIFA, the city of Belo Horizonte took charge of construction, and the stage was handed over in time for the match between Yugoslavia and Switzerland on June 25, 1950, even with improvisations. But soon the initial excitement for the new stadium was falling apart, since the 30,000 seats available did not meet the growing number of fans. Independência was uncomfortable for the audience, and did not offer good conditions for the press.\n\nThe early 1950s saw the first steps supporting the construction of a larger stadium in Belo Horizonte. Under the leadership of Gil César Moreira de Abreu, a group of students from the School of Engineering of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) proposed the construction of a University Stadium, to be located in the city's Pampulha region, where the university owned land. In 1956 the chairman of Federação Mineira de Futebol, Francisco de Castro Cortes proposed the construction of a Municipal Stadium on a location adjacent to the BR-040 highway, close to where \"BH Shopping\" mall stands today. The proposal asked for funds to be obtained through the sales of perpetual seating rights (\"'cadeiras cativas\"'). With the support of the President, former Minas Gerais Governor Juscelino Kubitschek, Cortes even arranged for engineers involved in the construction of Maracanã to come to Belo Horizonte and review the project.\n\nAt the time, Antonio Abrahão Caram was President of the Regional Sports Council (Conselho Regional de Desportos) in Minas Gerais, and became one of the strongest supporters of what was destined to become Mineirão. Abrahão Caram demonstrated impractical aspects of the project supported by Cortes, which was eventually abandoned in favor of a new project for the current stadium. The new project was prepared under the auspices of a team led by Benedicto Adami de Carvalho. In recognition of Abrahão Caram's role in proposing a feasible financial arrangement, selecting the venue, and assistance in drafting a State Assembly bill paving the way for the construction of Mineirão, in 1966 his name was officially designated to the avenue where the stadium is located, Avenida Antônio Abrahão Caram.\n\nOnce the design started to become a reality, then State Representative Jorge Carone Filho was assigned the mission of drafting the State Assembly bill that would help turn Mineirão a reality. The idea was to obtain funding through the State Lottery (Loteria Mineira) whose tickets would carry a 10% earmark toward a stadium building fund. \"Estádio Minas Gerais\" was then created under State Bill 1947 dated August 12, 1959, which was signed into Law by Governor José Francisco Bias Fortes. The law also provided for the creation of AEMG, an administrative tasked with managing the finished stadium. AEMG would later become ADEMG (Administração de Estádios do Estado de Minas Gerais).\n\nModifications to the original University Stadium were left to architects Eduardo Mendes Guimarães and Gaspar Garreto, which the goal of upgrading it from a 30,000 visitors venue into a new \"giant\" stadium capable of accommodating up to 100,000 visitors. The chosen site was located in the Pampulha region, in land owned by UFMG, whose President Pedro Paulo Penido was favorable to the project while expecting construction of Mineirão at the site of UFMG's new campus would attract an influx of people into this sparsely populated area. With the approval of President Kubitschek's Education Minister Clóvis Salgado, an agreement between UFMG and AEMG was signed on February 25, 1960, when the Brazilian federal government and the Federal University of Minas Gerais gave Minas Gerais land in the neighborhood of Pampulha, Belo Horizonte, for the construction of the stadium.\n\nWhen they began work on the stadium in 1959, engineers and workers were not sure it would be completed. Cesar Gil, the construction manager, faced financial crises, but knew how to use politics in favor of Mineirão. Despite the extreme control of spending, the works were facing, at each step, the depletion of resources. The initial loan of 100 million Cruzeiros evaporated in implementing the first service of its foundation. For a year and a half, the contract followed a slow pace, working with limited equipment and staffing minimum. While one group acted politically to change laws that enable the acquisition of resources and also convince the Governor Magalhães Pinto fund the construction, AEMG trying to adapt to the fragile financial situation.\n\nMineirão was planned by Eduardo Mendes Guimarães Júnior and Caspar Garreto, both architects. The structural project was undertaken by engineer Arthur Eugênio Jermann. The construction workmanship was directed by engineer Gil Cesar Moreira de Abreu. From 1963 to the date of its inauguration on September 5, 1965, approximately five thousand people were involved in the construction.\n\nThe new stadium was raised to the emblem for the national engineering by offering countless examples of evolution in construction. The team of engineers Mineirão went to the extreme in the details. Passed the Maracanã by a real x-ray, finding weaknesses that should not be repeated in the Mineirão field. In 1964, Gil Caesar sought in Tokyo, where arenas were built for Olympics, news about this type of work. Traders noted features and engineering innovations. Worried by the quality of the grass: tags and other minutiae.\n\nThe big question that engineers and workers were tested for their ability to perform a superstructure – a false ellipse, measuring the major axis of 275 meters and the lowest 217 meters – using conventional equipment. To evaluate and eliminate uncertainties, a \"mini-Mineirão\" was designed, called the experimental sector 15, where a link bleachers and roof would be subjected to all sorts of evidence. Concrete plants, conveyors, degrees, loaders and shuttle were tested. The complexity of the work required iron bars into lengths that the industry was unable to attend. The solution came in the actual construction site, where engineers and workers solder used to promote the extension of the bars.\n\nWith available resources could be hiring more people, but bumped into AEMG lack of qualified staff. Made a public bidding for the supply of labor, it was found to be unenforceable, because the price charged – 15 million Cruzeiros – was infinitely high box for the administration of the new field. It was proved in the future, the amount requested by the companies would build a Mineirão and a half. On accountability, the \"Gigante da Pampulha\" (Pampulha Giant) consumed a total of 10 million dollars. Because of the lack of skilled labor available, AEMG promoted the training of masons, carpenters, ship owners and other professionals. Whole classes were formed, and hundreds of workers have gained qualifications to perform special functions. At this stage, the administration managed to gather the required number needed to play and work at a fast pace. Between August 1964 and July 1965, the building jumped from one sector (the experiment) to offer the country's most modern stadium.\n\nTo speed construction and shorten the drama of the budget, Gil Caesar launched the operation 24 hours a day, divided into three shifts three thousand workers hired. The service did not stop a single minute. Acaiaca the top of the building in downtown Belo Horizonte, saw a huge flash of light coming from the sides of the future Mineirão. The administration began to reward teams for production and creativity, encouraging competition among the various sectors of the construction. The idea of \"local little game\" was so successful that many fronts have been completed well before the deadline. The full-time process allowed the stadium to be handed to the population in eight months. Even in the hectic pace and pressure, only one worker died during the entire construction of the arena.\n\nThe festivities marking the opening of the stadium included parachute jumpers, music, and an inaugural football match. The events were attended by 73,201 people. The inaugural match at Mineirão Stadium was played by the Minas Gerais state team and the Argentinian team, River Plate.\n\nThe record attendance of the stadium was 132,834 people in 1997 in Campeonato Mineiro final match between Cruzeiro and Villa Nova. The paying attendance was 74,857, and there were 56,618 women and children who entered for free. For safety reasons, the capacity of Mineirão has been reduced for the majority of its 40-year history. In 2004, by imposition of FIFA, the capacity of the stadium was reduced to 72,000 people.\n\nSince the stadium opening, the three most important teams in Belo Horizonte have hosted their matches in Mineirão: Cruzeiro (always), Atlético Mineiro and América. Mineirão has hosted also at least one match of the Brazilian national team in every FIFA World Cup qualifications, and matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2014 FIFA World Cup and men/women football matches of Olympic Games 2016.\n\nImportant matches and trophies won by local teams on Mineirão's pitch include:\n\nThe stadium's top scorer is Reinaldo, who played for Atlético from 1973 to 1984 and swung the nets 144 times. On the other hand, Cruzeiro's Tostão played from 1965 to 1972, scored 143 goals and had the best yearly average (17 goals).\n\n\nMineirão has been the venue to music events since its opening date:\n\n\nAfter the reform, the outside \"patio\" also became a viable location for concerts.\n\n\n"}

The theory is Nozick's attempt to describe \"justice in holdings\" (Nozick 1974:150)—or what can be said about and done with the property people own when viewed from a principle of justice.\n\nNozick's entitlement theory comprises three main principles:\n\n\nNozick believes that if the world were wholly just, only the first two principles would be needed, as \"the following inductive definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings\":\n\nThus, entitlement theory would imply \"a distribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they possess under the distribution\" (Nozick 1974:151). However, not everyone follows these rules: \"some people steal from others, or defraud them, or enslave them, seizing their product and preventing them from living as they choose, or forcibly exclude others from competing in exchanges\" (Nozick 1974:152). Thus the third principle of rectification is needed.\n\nEntitlement theory is based on John Locke's ideas. Under entitlement theory, people are represented as ends in themselves and equals, as Kant claimed, though different people may own (i.e. be entitled to) different amounts of property. Nozick's ideas create a strong system of private property and a free-market economy. The only just transaction is a voluntary one. Taxation of the rich to support full robust social programs for the poor is unjust because the state is acquiring money by force instead of through a voluntary transaction. However, Nozick's ideas can endorse the creation of a minimal social program for the poor. Every person in the state of nature can achieve a certain level of welfare according to their own abilities. This level of welfare, while not equal, must be maintained via the Lockean proviso. Given the justice of acquisition condition and the Lockean proviso, \"It is conceivable that in the normal operation of the economy, a private property regime might at some times, for some people, fail to provide access to this level of welfare when left to itself. If so, then justice—as the libertarian understands it—demands that the state act to correct the distribution of welfare generated by the spontaneous play of market forces.\"\n\nEntitlement theory contrasts sharply with the Principles of Justice in Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\", which states that each person has an equal claim to basic rights and liberties, and that inequality should only be permitted to the degree that such inequality is \"reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage\" (Rawls 1999: 53). There is a further provision that such inequalities are only permissible insofar as there is an equality of opportunity to benefit from these inequalities. Nozick instead argues that people who have or produce certain things have rights over them: \"on an entitlement view, [production and distribution] are not ... separate questions ... things come into the world already attached to people having entitlements over them\" (Nozick 1974:160). Nozick believes that unjustly taking someone's holdings violates their rights. \"Holdings to which ... people are entitled may not be seized, even to provide equality of opportunity for others\" (Nozick 1974:235). Thus, a system which works to reduce the rightfully earned holdings of some so that they can be equally distributed to others is immoral.\n\nIn his later work \"The Examined Life\", Nozick reflects that entitlement theory's defense of people's holdings may have some problems, in that it could eventually lead to the vast majority of resources being pooled in the hands of the extremely skilled, or, through gifts and inheritance, in the hands of the extremely skilled's friends and children. Nozick says:\n\nFurthermore, the notion of taxation being inherently unjust, and market transactions being inherently just, depends on the notion that they actually are as involuntary or voluntary as they appear: in a nation that permits free emigration of its citizens, taxation is not entirely involuntary, while market transactions for necessary goods and services can hardly be said to be entirely voluntary, and if the wealthy, or organized labor, or those in control of de facto industry standards are able to exert undue influence on such a market, they frequently skew those transactions to favor their own interests.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864059", "title": "Matthew 1:16", "text": "Matthew 1:16\n\nMatthew 1:16 is the sixteenth verse of the first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. The verse is the final part of the section that traces the genealogy of Joseph, the father of Jesus down from Abraham.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:16\nThis section begins with Jacob, Joseph's father, a figure about which nothing else is known. This also conflicts with that states that Heli is Joseph's father. There have been a number of explanations to explain this discrepancy, that Heli is Joseph's father and thus Jesus's grandfather or Heli, could be Mary's father, as noted in the Talmud.\n\nThe father of the Old Testament's Joseph is also named Jacob, and W. D. Davies and Dale Allison note that this could mean that the author of Matthew is trying to link Joseph with his Old Testament namesake. There are several other links in the text, both Josephs are spoken to in dreams, both travel to Egypt, and both have similarly righteous personalities.\n\nMatthew breaks with the pattern that has held throughout the genealogy, Joseph did not beget Jesus, but was simply the husband of the woman who did, implying the Virgin Birth. In the original Greek, the word translated as \"whom\" is unambiguously feminine. The shift to the passive voice also symbolizes the Virgin Birth.\n\nBrown notes that this verse has attracted considerable scholarly attention because the ancient sources show several different versions of it. Brown translates the Codex Koridethi as:\n\nThe Old Syriac Sinacticus has\n\nThese versions could be seen as evidence against the doctrine of the Virgin Birth, especially the Old Syriac Sinacticus version that states that Joseph was Jesus' father. However, both alternate versions actually add the word \"virgin\". Another theory is that the original version of Matthew simply continued the earlier pattern and had \"and Joseph was the father of Jesus,\" without necessarily meaning biological parentage. However the ease of misinterpretation led later transcribers to try to make the verse more clear, with each coming up with their own version.\n\nBrown himself feels that the alternate versions have nothing to do with the Virgin Birth. Rather he argues that an important issue at the time these later copies were made was that of the perpetual virginity of Mary and that both the Koridethi and OSS versions were attempts to do away with the word \"husband\".\n\nAnother issue raised by this verse is that if Joseph is no more than the husband of Jesus' mother then why did Matthew devote the last fourteen verses relating his genealogy? While Matthew makes clear that although Joseph was not Jesus' biological father, he was his legal father, and at the time legal kinship was generally considered more important than biological descent. Thus Jesus could properly be a member of the House of David despite only being an adopted son.\n"}

The trolls, angered by the trespassing boat, cast a spell onto riders as the vehicle began to move backward rapidly, accelerated by hidden conveyor belts underneath the water's surface. The boats floated briskly past scenes of polar bears and living trees, before coming to a stop on the edge of another waterfall, exposing the Norway pavilion's main thoroughfare. The backwards edge of the boat peeked out through the facade as the track pivoted to let the vehicle travel forward again. Correctly oriented, the boats plunged forward down a flume into a stormy depiction of the North Sea. After passing very close to an oil rig, the ride came to an abrupt end in a calm harbor of a small village, where the narrator announced, \"Norway's spirit has always been, and will always be adventure.\" As guests exited the ride, they had the option of watching a 5-minute tourism film, \"The Spirit of Norway\", which highlighted various attractions in Norway including skiing, hiking, and Kjerag mountain.\n\nHidden Mickeys on the ride included:\n\n"}

Section 1512 also provides that the federal government has extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute the offenses described by the section.\n\nWitness tampering is a criminal offense even if the attempt to tamper is unsuccessful. The offense also covers the intimidation of not only a witness himself or herself, but also intimidation of \"another person\" (i.e., a third party, such as a witness's spouse) in order to intimidate the witness. \n\nSection 1512 was created as part of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA). Before that time, federal prosecutions \"for attempting to or succeeding in corruptly influencing or intimidating witnesses\" were prosecuted under the general obstruction of justice statute, . VWPA established section 1512 to address the specific witness tampering issue, and simultaneously removed references to witnesses from section 1503. This led to uncertainly about whether witness tampering can now be exclusively prosecuted as a federal crime under section 1512, or whether it may also be prosecuted under section 1503 as an alternative or additional charge; the courts of appeals are split on this question.\n\nNotable people in the United States convicted of witness tampering include former South Dakota State Representative Ted Klaudt, political operative Roger Stone, real estate developer Charles Kushner, and Nine Trey Gangsters figure Laron Spicer.\n\nWitness tampering via bribery is not covered by 18 U.S.C. § 1512, but is rather prohibited by a different statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1510.\n\nIn England and Wales, witness intimidation is one form of the crime of perverting the course of justice. Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 includes the offences of intimidating a witness and taking revenge on a witness. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 provides for protections for witnesses at risk of intimidation.\n\nIn 2016, Jean-Pierre Bemba, a politician from Democratic Republic of the Congo, was convicted of witness tampering in the International Criminal Court. Bemba had separately been convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes arising from atrocities committed in the Central African Republic in 2002 and 2003, for which he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nEconomics have analyzed witness intimidation, which is one form of witness tampering, in terms of \"strategic complexity and two-sided uncertainty: criminals cannot know whether threats will deter witnesses, and witnesses cannot know whether threats will be carried out.\" Economists Brendan O'Flaherty and Rajiv Sethi created an model of this problem and suggest that in places where witness intimidation is a serious problem, \"communities can be trapped in equilibrium with collective silence: no witness testifies because none expects others to testify.\"\n\n"}

It was the last album with longtime vocalist and bassist John Payne, prior to the reunion of the original line-up in 2006.\n\n\"Silent Nation\" was recorded at Clear Lake Audio in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, and produced, engineered and mixed solely by Payne. The album features a stable line-up consisting of Payne, keyboard player Geoff Downes, guitarist Guthrie Govan and drummer Chris Slade, which had been achieved during \"Aura\" (2001) sessions. Early writing sessions were with guitarist and future member Billy Sherwood and drummer Jay Schellen. Eventually, two songs, \"Ghost in the Mirror\" and \"I Will Be There for You\", co-written by Sherwood, made the final album. \"Darkness Day\" and \"The Prophet\" were initially announced as \"The Sun Don't Shine\" and \"Sail Away\", respectively. An early track listing included \"Long and Lonely Ride\", but it was not finished in time. The main lyricist for \"Silent Nation\" was Payne. The lyrics are essentially based around the idea of the power centralization in the modern world, disfranchising the general public.\n\nThe album finally broke the tradition of naming Asia studio recordings with a word beginning and ending with the letter 'a'. The exception is \"Rare\" (1999), a collection of instrumental music, which was composed only by Payne and Downes, and, thus, may be viewed as their solo album. \"Silent Nation\" is also the first album to feature a photograph, not an illustration, as was Asia's trademark.\n\n\"Silent Nation\" was released on 31 August 2004 by Inside Out Music on CD and special edition CD/DVD-Video (featuring the making of the album). In Japan, it became available on 22 September 2004 through Victor and featured \"Rise\" as a bonus track.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1864071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864071", "title": "New Age travellers", "text": "New Age travellers\n\nNew Age travellers are people who often espouse New Age beliefs, and the hippie culture of the 1960s, and travel between music festivals and fairs, in order to live in a community with others who hold similar beliefs. Their transport and homes consist of vans, lorries, buses, cars, and caravans converted into mobile homes. They also make use of improvised bender tents, tipis, and yurts. \"New Age\" travellers largely originated in 1980s and early 1990s Britain, at which time they were pejoratively described as crusties.\n\nThe movement originated in the free festivals of the 1960s and 1970s such as the Windsor Free Festival, the early Glastonbury Festivals, Elephant Fayres, and the huge Stonehenge Free Festivals in Great Britain. However, there were longstanding precedents for travelling cultures in Great Britain, including travelling pilgrims, itinerant journeymen and traders, as well as Romani groups and others. Later events included the Castlemorton Common Festival, a huge free and unlicensed event which attracted widespread media coverage and prompted government action. Some legal festivals, such as WOMAD, continue to take place in a variety of countries, including the UK.\n\nIn the UK during the 1980s the travellers' mobile homes—generally old vans, trucks and buses (including double-deckers)—moved in convoys. One group of travellers came to be known as the Peace Convoy after visits to CND protest camps. The movement had faced significant opposition from the British government and from mainstream media, epitomised by the authorities' attempts to prevent free festivals at Stonehenge, and the resultant Battle of the Beanfield in 1985—the largest mass civil arrest in English history.\n\nIn 1986 and subsequent years police again blocked travellers from \"taking the Stones\" on the Summer Solstice (June 21). This led Travelers to spend summers squatting by the hundreds on several sites adjacent to the A303 in Wiltshire.\n\nMany people see the Castlemorton Common Festival in 1992, a weeklong festival that attracted up to 30,000 travellers and ravers, as a significant turning point for New Age Travellers in Britain, as it directly resulted in the government granting new powers to police and local authorities under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to prevent such events in the future. The Criminal Justice Act included sections against disruptive trespass, squatting and unauthorised camping which made life increasingly difficult for travellers, and many left Britain for Ireland and mainland Europe, particularly Spain.\n\nHowever, thousands of people still live a traveller lifestyle in Britain. Few, if any, travellers live on the local authority sites reserved for Romani/Gypsy, Scottish Gypsies/Travellers and Irish Travellers, so instead stay on unauthorised sites throughout the countryside, particularly in Wales and the south-west of England, and in urban areas. London hosts a large number of traveller sites in places such as disused factories and warehouse yards, and there is often a crossover between travellers and squatters, with travellers parking up in yards attached to squatted buildings. Typical traveller sites might have anywhere from 5 to 30 vehicles on them, including trailers and caravans as well as buses, vans, and horseboxes converted to live in. Although most travellers in Britain are British, large numbers of Continental Europeans also \"travel\" in the UK.\n\nAs unauthorised sites are evicted and travellers moved on frequently, accessing basic services such as health and dental care, refuse collection, benefits, and education for children can be problematic. Many traveller families home-school their children.\n\nAlthough travellers have only taken to the road since the 1960s, many traveller families have reached their third or fourth generation. Despite widespread popular assumptions about travellers living on state handouts, many do seasonal or temporary work, on farms and building sites or in factories and pubs for example. Others work as self-employed mechanics, electricians and plumbers, or make money selling scrap (including building materials - often exotic and rare such as parquet flooring, or antique lead and copper fitting stripped illegally from private and public buildings used as illegal squats), or running stalls at markets and car boot sales. Festivals during the summer also present many opportunities for travellers to make money through offering entertainment, services and goods to festival goers. A high level of mutual aid, the sharing of childcare and vehicle maintenance and \"skipping\" (collecting food from local supermarket skips) within communities allow travellers to live on very low incomes.\n\nThe traveller and free party scenes often have close links, and many travellers run or are involved with the sound systems of raves and squat parties.\n\nHousetruckers—whether individuals, families or groups—convert old trucks and school buses into mobile homes and live in them, preferring an unattached and transient lifestyle to using more conventional housing. These unique vehicles began appearing around New Zealand during the mid-1970s and even though there are fewer they continue to adorn New Zealand roads.\n\nAn early manifestation of this culture came with the Blerta (1970–1973) traveling circus of music, light theatre and art. This involved a well-known New Zealand actor, Bruno Lawrence, and 30 or 40 hangers-on who traveled around the country in a clapped-out Bedford bus, sang, wrote and did hippie art. Most of the riders were radicals, hippies, groovers and free thinkers. They attracted a following and had a hit single with \"Dance around the world\" which was nominated for the Loxene Golden Disc in 1971, a local musical award at the time. After 1973 the Blerta project ran out of steam, and Lawrence turned his hand back to acting in such movies as \"Smash Palace\" in 1981.\n\n\n\n"}

The most conservative French right-wingers such as Michel Junot, Claude Reichman, Jean-François Touzé, Alain Griotteray and Michel Poniatowski were present at the creation of the movement.\n\nAfter the failure of Millon's project to merge \"La Droite\" into Charles Pasqua's \"Rassemblement pour la France\" (RPF) and the \"Centre national des indépendants et paysans\" (CNI), Millon founded the Liberal Christian Right (\"Droite libérale chrétienne\") in October 1999. However, most members of \"La Droite\" refused to join the new party. Only three deputies, including Charles Millon, joined it. The first two of these deputies were beaten at the 2002 legislative election while the last one didn't run himself. In September 2002, Charles Millon was then named ambassador to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, while the Millonist group at the Rhône-Alpes regional council (\"Oui à Rhône-Alpes\", ORA) fusionned itself with the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) conservative party, led by Nicolas Sarkozy.

Ten of the thirteen founding members have remained in the conference since its inception. Three schools left the conference before 1966 and four have joined since 1991, bringing the current membership to fourteen.\n\n\n\nAll 14 SEC schools play football.\n\nSince the SEC expanded in 1992, divisional champions have been crowned.

This placed it behind the Socialist Party but ahead of the established centre-right parties, the Gaullist Rally for the Republic-DL list and the UDF. However Philippe de Villiers' departure in late 2000, in order to refound his Movement for France, severely damaged the party and Pasqua failed to run in the 2002 Presidential elections. The RPF has since suffered several setbacks in various elections and has failed to regain its 1999-2000 momentum, and has been eclipsed by the MPF as a party of the Eurosceptic right in France. The party won two seats in the 2002 National Assembly election, through an alliance with the UMP but lost all its MEPs in the 2004 European election. Charles Pasqua was elected Senator for the Hauts-de-Seine in the 2004 French Senate election. He sat in the UMP group.\n\nThe RPF remains an associate party of the main centre-right party, the UMP.\n\n"}

The party replaced, in 2002, the Citizens' Movement (\"Mouvement des citoyens\", MDC) founded by Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who left the Socialist Party (PS) in 1993 due to his opposition to the Persian Gulf War and to the Maastricht Treaty. It is a Eurosceptic party with leftist aspirations.\n\nChevènement led the list \"l'autre politique\" (the Other Policy) for 1994 European Parliament election. It included members of left-wing opposition (socialist and communist candidates) to Maastricht Treaty, feminists, radicals and Gaullists.\n\nThe MDC supported the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin for the 1995 presidential election, then integrated the \"Gauche plurielle\" coalition. From 1997 to 2000, it was represented in the government by Chevènement as Interior Minister. In order to prepare the 2002 presidential election, Chevènement created the \"Pôle républicain\", which included a wide range of politicians: radicals, Gaullists, souverainists, socialists. He won over 5% and is sometimes blamed for Jospin's elimination. Its lack of success in the legislative election (losing all 7 MDC deputies elected in 1997) prompted Chevènement to rename his party the Citizen and Republican Movement. Chevènement was defeated in his seat in Territoire-de-Belfort.\n\nThe foundation of the MRC meant a realignment to the left. Indeed, the \"Pôle républicain\" was supposed to gather \"the Republicans of the left and the right\".\n\nChevènement and the MRC supported the Socialist Ségolène Royal's candidacy in the 2007 presidential election, to prevent a new 21 April 2002 shock. The MRC fielded candidates in the 2007 French legislative election, including Chevènement in Territoire-de-Belfort, seat he had lost in 2002 to the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). He failed to win back his seat, but a former Gaullist of the left, Christian Hutin was elected in the Nord département.\n\nThe party has one Senator, Chevènement, who sits in the European Democratic and Social Rally (RDSE) group, which is the most Europhile group. It also has 19 regional councillors and 8 general councillors.\n\nIn the 2009 European Parliament election and the 2014 European Parliament election, the party did not run or support any list. Negotiations with the Socialist Party and the new Left Front failed.\n\nIn October 2018, PS MEP Emmanuel Maurel and senator Marie-Noëlle Lienemann announced that they would leave the Socialists to ally with the MRC in a new party called \"Gauche républicaine et socialiste\" (GRS). On 12 November 2018, a group presided over by Jean-Marie Alexandre announced the reconstitution of the MDC as a party.\n\n"}

He was the elder brother of Johann Krieger.\n\nThe Krieger brothers came from a Nuremberg family of rugmakers. According to Johann Mattheson's \"Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte\", Johann Philipp started studying keyboard playing at age 8, with Johann Drechsel (a pupil of the celebrated Johann Jakob Froberger) and other instruments at around the same time, with Gabriel Schütz. He was apparently a gifted student, displaying absolute pitch and a feeling for keyboard music: according to Mattheson, already after a year of studies he was able to impress large audiences and was composing attractive arias. Johann Philipp soon left Nuremberg for Copenhagen, where he spent some four or five years, studying organ playing with Johann Schröder, the royal organist, and composition with Kaspar Förster. The precise dates of his stay in Copenhagen are unknown: Mattheson reports 1665 to 1670, but Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr, author of a 1730 biographical volume on famous residents of Nuremberg, claimed Johann Philipp stayed in Copenhagen between 1663 and 1667. During his stay, whenever it occurred, Johann Philipp was offered an invitation to become organist in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway), which he declined.\n\nMattheson and Doppelmayr also differ on the details of Johann Philipp's subsequent career. He and his brother evidently spent some time in Zeitz, studying composition, and also went to Bayreuth, where Johann Philipp became court organist, and then rose to the rank of Kapellmeister, Johann succeeding him as court organist. However, the precise dates are again unknown. Doppelmayr gives 1669–70 for the Bayreuth stay, while Mattheson confusingly reports that Johann Philipp was at Zeitz in 1670–71, and at Bayreuth in 1670–72. Research has shown that the civic records of Zeitz contain no mention of either brother, and Bayreuth records list Johann Philipp as court organist in 1673, complicating the matter further.\n\nJohann Philipp was still employed in Bayreuth in 1673, when Margrave Christian Ernst left to fight in the Franco-Dutch War. Following that, the composer was granted permission to travel to Italy without loss of salary. He stayed in Venice, studying with Johann Rosenmüller (composition) and Giovanni Battista Volpe (keyboard), and then in Rome, where his teachers were Antonio Maria Abbatini (composition) and Bernardo Pasquini (keyboard and composition). In 1675 Johann Philipp went to Vienna, then one of the most important musical capitals of Europe, where he played for Emperor Leopold I. The Emperor was a well-known patron of the arts and a composer; upon hearing Krieger's performance, he was sufficiently impressed to ennoble him and all his brothers and sisters.\n\nJohann Philipp later returned to Bayreuth, and shortly thereafter travelled to Frankfurt and Kassel. He was offered job invitations in both cities, but either declined both, or held them for a very short time. On 2 November 1677 Johann Philipp was employed as court organist at Halle. Duke August died in 1680 and was succeeded by his brother, Johann Adolf I, who moved the court to Weißenfels. Johann Philipp went with him as Kapellmeister, and this was his last position: he held it for 45 years, until his death. The court's musical establishment soon became one of Germany’s greatest. Two years after Johann Philipp moved to Weißenfels, his brother Johann moved to Zittau, similarly to accept a position he would occupy for several decades until his death.\n\nJohann Philipp was a prolific composer and supplied the Weißenfels court with countless sacred and secular works, including some 2,000 cantatas, at least 18 operas, trio-sonatas, etc. He also had numerous works by other composers performed at the court, and kept a catalogue of every piece he performed. He actively published his own music: a set of trio sonatas appeared in 1688, to be followed by another, then a collection of music for wind instruments, etc. Unfortunately, numerous works were lost: for instance, of the 2,000 cantatas only 76 are extant. This is the case with his brother's music, too: hundreds of his compositions are listed in Johann Philipp's catalogue, but very few survive. Johann Philipp died in 1725. He was succeeded as Weißenfels Kapellmeister by his son, Johann Gotthilf, until 1736.\n\nCollections of Krieger's music published during the composer's lifetime, in chronological order.\n\nIn the 21st century Krieger was suggested as one of three possible composers of the Kyrie–Gloria Mass for double choir, BWV Anh. 167.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1864131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864131", "title": "FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup", "text": "FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup\n\nThe FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup is an international beach soccer competition contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA, the sport's global governing body.\n\nThe tournament was established in 1995 as the \"Beach Soccer World Championship\", taking place every year for the next decade under the supervision of Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW) and its predecessors. Due to the sport's rapid growth, FIFA took an interest in the sport, and as the main tournament in world beach soccer, it joined hands with BSWW in 2005 to take over the organization of the competition, re-branding it as an official FIFA tournament. Since 2009, the tournament has taken place every two years to allow continental tournaments to flourish without the burden of the World Cup qualifiers crowding the schedule every 12 months. The growing global popularity of beach soccer resulted in FIFA's decision to move the stage of the World Cup from its native home in Brazil to other parts of the globe to capitalise on and continue to stimulate global interest. The first edition held outside Brazil was in 2008 in Marseille, France.\n\nThe current tournament format lasts over approximately 10 days and involves 16 teams initially competing in four groups of four teams. The group winners and runners-up advance to a series of knock-out stages until the champion is crowned. The losing semi-finalists play each other in a play-off match to determine the third and fourth-placed teams.\n\nThe most recent edition in 2019 was held in Asunción, Paraguay, and crowned Portugal as champions for the second time – after defeating Italy 4–6 in the final.\n\nThe first Beach Soccer World Cup was held in Brazil, in 1995, organised by the precursors to the modern-day founders of the standardised rules, Beach Soccer Worldwide, held under the title \"Beach Soccer World Championship\". Eight teams were selected to take part, without going through a qualification process. However Brazil, the hosts, dominated and easily won the cup without losing a game. The tournament was successful and BSWW announced that the competition would take place every year.\n\nBy 1997, more teams had already stated their interest in participating and therefore BSWW extended their selection to 10 teams for 1998. Brazil continued to dominate, despite this change. Immediately, BSWW extended to 12 teams for 1999, spreading their selection across five continents, introducing more new teams to the tournament.\nHowever, with all these changes it still took until the 2001 World Cup for Brazil to lose the title after winning the competition six years on the run since the establishment. It was Portugal who won the tournament, with Brazil finishing in a disappointing fourth place.\n\nWith this change of champions, more countries thought there was a chance for themselves to win the tournament and this sparked more interest worldwide. Not surprisingly, Brazil reclaimed their title in 2002, when BSWW reduced the number of contestants back to eight.\nThe last \"Beach Soccer World Championship\" to be organised purely by BSWW was in 2004 when twelve teams played, seven from Europe.\n\nIn 2005, FIFA paired up with BSWW to co-organise the World Cup, although FIFA seem to have the most control. They kept the tradition of holding the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro and continued to allow 12 teams to participate, following on from the 2004 competition. It was Eric Cantona's France that won the competition, after beating Portugal on penalties in the final.\nThe tournament was deemed a major success and therefore FIFA took advantage. For the 2006 competition and beyond, FIFA decided to standardise the participants to 16 countries. It was then that the \"FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Qualifiers\" were also established, that would take place throughout the year. Again this decision was a successful one and more countries became interested in a now standard FIFA competition.\nBy the end of the 2007 World Cup, the tournament had become very popular throughout the world, with the FIFA board taking over the competition, driving more countries to recognize beach soccer as a major sport. Since the World Cup had become a success worldwide, FIFA decided to have a change of venue. It was voted, to extend the sport's popularity, the 2008 World Cup would take place in Marseille, France, and the 2009 World Cup would take place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. These tournaments would be the first to take place outside Brazil.\nThe 2008 competition was once again a major success, despite being held in a different country. This was the first time that Brazil would have to qualify for the tournament, since they weren't the hosts. However Brazil won the qualifiers and the World Cup in July.\nThe 2009 World Cup in Dubai was an even bigger success, as the second competition outside Brazil and the Beach Soccer World Cup's 15th birthday, Brazil continued their dominance.\n\nJust before the final of the 2009 World Cup, FIFA announced that a new format would see the World Cup now take place every two years, starting from the 2011 World Cup. FIFA justified the decision by stating that they wanted Confederations to have more time to develop the sport, therefore allowing a year in between World Cups for Confederations to organise their own local tournaments. This was a mutual decision between Confederations and FIFA. In March 2010 FIFA confirmed that the 2011 World Cup would take place in Italy and the 2013 World Cup would take place in Tahiti.\n\nIn 2013, FIFA extended the FIFA Champions Badge to the winners of the competition, where it was first won by Russia.\n\nFrom 1995 until 2005 there was no standard qualification system for nations to go through to earn a place at the World Cup finals. The process in which teams gained entry into the finals was inconsistent from one year to the next throughout the confederations, often down to a simple invite to participate in the finals from BSWW, or potentially qualification by reaching the latter stages in a premier regional tournament with no prior ties with the World Cup, or perhaps by performing well in the previous World Cup.\n\nDuring this period, nations from Africa, Asia and sometimes North America were the usual recipients of invitations, due to a lack of regional tournaments for BSWW to determine who was best in said region and worthy to play in the finals. Typically, European nations qualified by doing well in the Euro Beach Soccer League and South American nations in the Americas' League, sometimes jointly with North American nations who also qualified along with them in such circumstances. It was still common for other 'wild-card' European and South American nations to receive invites despite not performing well continentally. However, during the early years of the championships, invitation was the common form of eligibility for all nations.\n\nFollowing the success of the inaugural FIFA tournament in 2005, the number of teams at the finals was increased by FIFA to a record 16 and so the governing body along with BSWW met with individual confederations to set up a standard qualifying process for each world cup, by establishing regional championships for each continent. The winners of these championships would be crowned the best team in the region, promoting regional competitiveness, and most importantly act as a consistent method of qualification to the World Cup for the best teams of each confederation. This would also help increase the sport's awareness across all corners of the globe and make sure all confederations were represented at the finals at every following World Cup, unlike in the past.\n\nBesides Europe, who continued to use the Euro Beach Soccer League as the method of World Cup qualification until 2008, all other confederations hosted their first championships in 2006 in view of the finals later that year.\n\nThe allocation of World Cup spots and hence how many teams qualify from their regional championship to the World Cup was decided by FIFA in 2006 as follows:\n\nThe host country's confederation loses one qualification spot. I.e. since the 2015 World Cup was held in Portugal, they automatically qualified taking up one of the five European spots. Therefore, in the 2015 UEFA qualifiers, only four teams qualified from the championships to join the hosts making the total of five European nations.\n\nAs shown in the table, attendance of nations in qualification tournaments generally continues to rise year on year; the total global number of participants has nearly doubled since 2006.\n\nDespite being the premier tournament in most regions, since the primary objective is to qualify to the World Cup, on a rare occasion teams have not participated due to qualifying to the finals automatically as hosts such as Brazil deferring from the 2007 CONMBEBOL Beach Soccer Championship and Tahiti in the 2013 OFC Beach Soccer Championship.\n\nBrazil are by far the most successful nation, with 14 titles. However their hold on the title has become less apparent since the tournament came under the control of FIFA and moved outside of Rio. They are followed by Portugal (2001, 2015, and 2019) with three wins, Russia (2011 and 2013) with two, and France with one title (2005). France won the first FIFA-sanctioned tournament in 2005. Brazil and Portugal are the only teams to win the world championship before and after FIFA started sanctioning the sport.\n\nOverall 18 of the 46 nations who have ever competed have made a top four finish. Brazil remained the only nation to finish in the final four every championship until 2015 when they finished in fifth place. Of those 18 nations, only 7 have made a top four finish before and after FIFA started sanctioning the World Cup.\n\nSince the tournament's establishment in 1995, as of the 2019 World Cup, 46 countries have participated over the 20 competitions. However, only one country has participated in all World Cups, which is Brazil. European teams have dominated in appearances by continent, since 15 of the 46 countries have been from Europe, at least double than that of any other.\n\nBefore qualification began, many of the same nations were invited back year on year. This meant that once qualification was introduced in 2006, giving all nations in that confederation a chance to earn a berth at the finals, there was an initial influx of new nations making their debut, including African teams whose continent had only been represented by one nation before and Oceanian countries who had never had their continent been represented previously.\n\nOnly 8 of the 46 countries have failed to appear in a FIFA controlled World Cup. Peru (5) have appeared in the most competitions without any one of those being under FIFA's control. Meanwhile, Iran and Senegal (7) have appeared in the most FIFA sanctioned tournaments without having ever appeared in the old World Championships before 2005.\n\n\"Italics\" indicates pre-2005, non-FIFA World Championships\nApps. – Appearances\nQFs – Quarter finals\n\n\"As of 2019\"\nThis table shows the overall statistics of all 20 World Cups that have occurred since 1995, combining the results of both the original \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" era and the current \"FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup\" era.\nThis table shows the overall statistics of all 10 World Cups that have occurred since 2005, of the current \"FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup\" era only.\nThis table shows the overall statistics of all 10 World Cups that occurred between 1995 and 2004, of the now defunct \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" era only.\nThe following documents the winners of the awards presented during the FIFA era of the World Cup.

The beyond) is a 1981 Italian Southern Gothic supernatural horror film directed by Lucio Fulci, and starring Catriona MacColl and David Warbeck. Its plot follows a woman who inherits a hotel in rural Louisiana that was once the site of a horrific murder, and which may be a gateway to hell. It is the second film in Fulci's \"Gates of Hell\" trilogy after \"City of the Living Dead\" (1980), and was followed by \"The House by the Cemetery\" (1981).\n\nFilmed on location in and around New Orleans in late 1980 with assistance from the Louisiana Film Commission, additional photography took place at De Paolis Studios in Rome. Released theatrically in Italy in the spring of 1981, \"The Beyond\" did not see a North American release until late 1983 through Aquarius Releasing, who released an alternate version of the film titled 7 Doors of Death; this version featured an entirely different musical score and ran several minutes shorter than Fulci's original cut. The original version of the film saw its first United States release in September 1998 through a distribution partnership between Rolling Thunder Pictures, Grindhouse Releasing and Cowboy Booking International.\n\nFollowing its release, reception of \"The Beyond\" was polarized. Contemporary and retrospective critics have praised the film for its surrealistic qualities, special effects, musical score and cinematography, but note its narrative inconsistencies; horror filmmakers and surrealists have interpreted these inconsistencies as intentionally disorienting, supplementing the atmospheric tone and direction. \"The Beyond\" is ranked among Fulci's most celebrated films, and has gained an international cult following over the ensuing decades.\n\nAt Louisiana's Seven Doors Hotel in 1927, a lynch mob murders an artist named Schweick, whom they believe to be a warlock. Schweick was in the middle of finishing a grotesque painting, which is seen as part of a seance and evidence of the mob's belief. Since Schweick was killed while the painting was being completed, this counts as a human sacrifice and one of the Seven Doors of Death opens, allowing the dead to cross into the world of the living.\n\nIn 1981, Liza Merrill, a young woman from New York City, inherits the hotel and plans to re-open it. Her renovation work activates the hell portal, and she contends with increasingly strange incidents. Larry, a painter, falls off his rig after seeing a white-eyed woman and is badly injured, coughing up blood and babbling about her eyes. Dr. John McCabe arrives to take the injured man to the hospital, and offers Liza some sympathy. The bell for room 36 rings, and Liza dismisses it as malfunctioning. A plumber named Joe investigates flooding in the cellar and a demonic hand gouges out his eye. His body and another are later discovered by a hotel maid, Martha.\n\nLiza encounters a blind woman named Emily, who warns that reopening the hotel would be a mistake. Joe's wife Mary-Anne and their daughter Jill arrive at the hospital morgue to claim Joe's corpse. After tending to her late husband's corpse, Mary-Anne screams in terror which causes her to fall to the floor; Jill finds her mother lying on the floor unconscious, her face burned by acid that toppled over from the impact. As she tries to flee, Jill encounters a corpse coming back to life. Meanwhile, Liza meets with Dr. John McCabe and they exchange their life stories over dinner. Liza admits her multiple failed careers, and how reopening the hotel will fulfill her hopes for success. McCabe talks about his experience as a doctor giving him a better grasp of reality, and led to his atheism. He then receives a phone call informing her of Mary-Anne's death. After the funerals, it's revealed that Jill has become a ghoul. Later, Liza encounters Emily at the hotel. Emily tells Liza the story of Schweick, and warns her to not enter Room 36. The bell rings again, and Liza notes how terrified Emily becomes afterwards. When Emily examines Schweick's painting, she begins to bleed and flees the hotel. Liza attempts to go after Emily, but notices that her own footsteps are audible, while those of Emily and her guide dog Dicky are not.\n\nLiza ignores Emily's advice and investigates Room 36. She discovers an ancient book titled \"Eibon\" and sees Schweick's corpse nailed to the bathroom wall. She flees the room in terror, but is stopped by John. She takes him to Room 36, but both the corpse and the book are gone. Liza describes her fearful encounters with Emily, but John insists that Emily is not real. While in town, Liza spots a copy of \"Eibon\" in the window of a book store, but when she rushes in to grab it, a different book is in its place. The shop owner says the book has been there for years, prompting Liza to remark to John that perhaps it is all in her head. At the hotel, a worker named Arthur attempts to repair the same leak as Joe, but is killed off-screen by ghouls.\n\nLiza's friend Martin Avery visits the public library to find the hotel's blueprints revealing a large unknown space in the center. He becomes curious but is struck by a sudden force and falls from a ladder, resulting in paralysis. Spiders appear out of nowhere and swarm over his body, ravaging his face and killing him. Back at the hotel, Martha is cleaning the bathroom in Room 36 when Joe's animated corpse emerges from the bathtub. Joe pushes her head into one of the exposed nails where Schweick's corpse was earlier, killing her and gouging one of her eyes. Later, the walking corpses of Schweik, Joe, Mary-Anne, Martin and Arthur invade Emily's house due to her warning Liza about the impending doom. She orders them to leave her alone, and insists she will not return with Schweick. She commands Dicky to attack the corpses, and they are scared away. Dicky turns on Emily immediately after, tearing out her throat and ripping off her ear.\n\nAt the hotel, spirits terrorize Liza while John breaks into Emily's house—which appears to have been abandoned for years—and finds \"Eibon\". Liza suffers a mental breakdown when Arthur's corpse tries to kill her, and the bell rings when she tries to escape. John returns to the hotel and patronizes Liza, accusing her of placing the book in the house and making up everything to get to him. His final decision to disregard her fears is when he spitefully reads the book, and learns the hotel is a gateway to Hell. A sudden force roars and bleeds all over them, making them flee. Schweick's painting bleeds, and an unseen force says \"And you will face the sea of darkness, and all therein that may be explored\".\n\nThe blood-soaked pair retreat to the hospital, which is empty. John tries to think of some logical answer for the events, but the hospital is suddenly overrun by zombies. Liza is attacked by Larry's corpse, but John gets a gun out of his desk and they escape, only to become separated. Only Dr. Harris and Jill are found still alive, but Harris is killed by flying shards of glass. Liza, John and Jill try to flee, but are confronted by Schweick's corpse. No matter how many times he is shot by John, he continues his pursuit. Jill attacks Liza and is killed by John.\n\nEscaping the zombies, John and Liza rush down a set of stairs but find themselves back in the basement of the hotel. John notes how impossible the entire ordeal is, but has no choice but to accept them to be real. They move forward through the flooded labyrinth and stumble into a supernatural wasteland—the same landscape in Schweick's painting, which turns out to be Hell itself. No matter which direction they travel, they find themselves back at their starting point. They are ultimately blinded just like Emily, succumb to the darkness, and disappear.\n\n\nJohn Thonen of \"Cinefantastique\" wrote that \"The Beyond\" has \"a story structure akin to that of an advanced fever dream\". Film scholar Wheeler Dixon similarly wrote that the \"slight framing narrative is merely the excuse for Fulci to stage a series of macabre, distressing set pieces\". Writer Bill Gibron suggested that the film has a subtext of \"slavery, witchcraft, mob justice—and perhaps the key to almost all Fulci narratives—revenge\" at its core.\n\nThe concept of \"the beyond\", which the characters Liza and John enter in the films' final sequence, is interpreted by film writer Meagan Navarro as a statement on \"the Catholic concept of purgatory\". Fulci was a lapsed Catholic, and previous films of his, such as \"Don't Torture a Duckling\" (1972), had dealt with corruption among clergy.\n\nA prominent theme, according to film scholar Phillip L. Simpson, is that of blindness as a result of exposure to evil, specifically tied to the Book of Eibon: \"The book, like many other (in)famous 'evil' books found in literature and cinema, is a physical, written record of valuable occult knowledge that attempts to codify—accompanied by dire warnings that careless or ignorant deployment of that power will result in horrific consequences—what is otherwise usually represented as literally 'unseeable'.\" Simpson interprets the film's \"pervasive images of blindness and eye mutilation\" as being directly consequential to characters' exposure to the book. Simpson points out that only Schweick, the warlock lynched in the film's 1927 prologue, and Emily, a \"seeress who transcends temporality\", possess the \"necessary sight\" to interpret the contents of the book.\n\nProducer Fabrizio De Angelis said that on his previous collaboration with Fulci, \"Zombi 2\" (1979), they had aspired to make \"a comic book movie... that is, instead of being scared, people would laugh when they saw these zombies\". Instead, audiences largely responded with fear, prompting them to make a straightforward horror film. After making \"City of the Living Dead\" (1980), Fulci sought to make a follow-up film as part of a trilogy with the \"Gates of Hell\" being a unifying theme. Simpson describes the trilogy as being loosely \"connected by the trope of hapless mortals literally living on top of an entrance to Hell and then inadvertently falling into it\".\nThe base concept for \"The Beyond\" was devised by Fulci, Giorgio Mariuzzo, and Dardano Sacchetti. A poster designed by Enzo Sciotti was produced based solely on the treatment in hopes of selling the film to international markets, and the film's title was chosen based on a conversation between Fulci and De Angellis. De Angelis recalled Fulci discussing the film's concept with him: \"So he's telling me this story about a couple moving into a house, where underneath is hell. And I was like, 'What does this mean?'... there weren't any dead people, maybe killed... No, there was hell under that house!\" And he said 'the beyond.' And when I heard 'The Beyond,' that was already the title.\" After receiving De Angellis's approval, Fulci requested that Sacchetti begin writing a full screenplay based on the brief treatment they had completed. According to De Angellis, much of the plot was devised based on vague ideas Fulci had for various death scenes, as well as several key words that he felt unified his vision. Some elements of the screenplay were derived in an arbitrary manner, such as the design of the Eibon symbol, which Fulci based on the shape of a trivial amateur tattoo his daughter had gotten on her arm.\n\nSacchetti's conception of the \"beyond\" was based on his own ruminations on death, and the \"suffering of being born condemned to death... [of being] born to be erased\". Sacchetti sought to depict the beyond as a hell full of dead souls, an otherworld existing \"outside of Euclidean geometry\". Originally, the film's final sequence in which the characters enter the \"beyond\" was meant to take place at an amusement park, where the two main characters, now dead, are able to enjoy themselves in a \"great amusement park of life\". Due to logistical restrictions, however, this was unable to be filmed, and the existing final sequence—in which the characters enter a vast desert landscape full of corpses—was devised by Sacchetti \"on the spur of the moment\". In an interview, Fulci gave the film's budget as 580 million Italian lire, half the amount that De Angelis had originally allotted to it.\n\nAlthough Fulci originally intended to cast \"Zombi 2\" star Tisa Farrow as Liza Merrill, English actress Catriona MacColl was chosen after having worked with him previously on \"City of the Living Dead\". She would go on to appear in the subsequent final film of Fulci's \"Gates of Hell\" trilogy, \"The House by the Cemetery\", as well. MacColl would later deem \"The Beyond\" to be her personal favorite film of the trilogy, stating that she remains drawn to the \"decadent Italian macabre poetry\" that she feels the film exudes.\n\nDavid Warbeck was cast as Dr. John McCabe after he and Fulci became friends during the making of \"The Black Cat\" (1981). Originally, the roles of Joe the Plumber and Professor Harris were to be played by Venantino Venantini and Ivan Rassimov, respectively, but they were replaced by two of Fulci's friends, stage actor Tonino Pulci and \"Zombi 2\" co-star Al Cliver, whom the director affectionately nicknamed \"Tufus\". Partway during the shoot, French actor Antoine Saint-John, who played the doomed painter Schweick, was replaced by Giovanni De Nava, who played the \"zombified\" version of the character; De Nava is sometimes mistakenly credited for playing Joe.\n\nFor the role of the ghostly Emily, Stefania Casini was originally considered, but Casini turned down the role as she did not want to wear the blinding contact lenses she would have been required to wear. Fulci instead cast actress and model Cinzia Monreale, who had previously starred in his Spaghetti Western \"Silver Saddle\" (1978). Monreale was drawn to the film as she felt Fulci's concept was \"well written and full of mystery,\" and she had enjoyed her time working with him previously.\n\nThe majority of \"The Beyond\" was filmed on location in late 1980 in New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as the outlying cities of Metairie, Monroe, and Madisonville. Larry Ray, a New Orleans resident and member of the Louisiana Film Commission, was hired to help Fulci scout locations. While scouting, Fulci took a liking to Ray and hired him as a production manager and producer's assistant. Within New Orleans proper, filming was completed in the \"Vieux Carré\" district, as well as on the campus of Dillard University. The funeral sequence in the graveyard was shot at the Saint Louis Cemetery no. 1.\n\nThe historic Otis House near Lake Pontchartrain, located within the Fairview-Riverside State Park, served as the Seven Doors Hotel. During filming, the production designers aged the home's exteriors by spraying the siding with water and dark dye, as well as throwing cement and sand on the floors to make it appear dusty and dilapidated. According to Ray, the sand damaged the original wood floors, and the production had to pay the State of Louisiana to restore them once filming wrapped. The sequence in which Liza meets Emily on the bridge was shot on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, while Emily's house was the same New Orleans residence used in Louis Malle's \"Pretty Baby\" (1978).\n\nTo achieve the film's stark visual style, cinematographer Sergio Salvati photographed the New Orleans exteriors using \"warm colors\" in hope of capturing the \"sun, the heat, [and] the jazz\" of the city. Salvati contrasted the urban New Orleans settings with the \"cooler\" interiors of the hotel, which often feature cool blue, orange, and violet lighting.\n\nAccording to Ray, Fulci had no official shooting script present while filming \"The Beyond\", only a treatment that ran three pages in length:\n\nThe majority of the cast were English speakers, while Fulci spoke Italian. Due to the language barrier, much of Fulci's direction was done with \"miming, making faces and moving his body in order to make the actors understand what he wanted of them.\" As he was a fluent Italian speaker, Ray served as Fulci's translator and interpreter throughout the shoot.\n\nAfter filming had completed in the United States, additional photography took place at De Paolis Studios in Rome, primarily consisting of the special effects-intensive scenes. Among these were the interior shots of the film's opening sequence featuring the mob murder, as well as interior replicas of Emily's home. Some additional sequences featuring Emily's dog were also shot in Rome, which required the production to find a lookalike German Shepherd in Italy. According to MacColl, the film's end sequence, in which she and Warbeck's characters enter \"the beyond,\" was completed on their last day of shooting, on 22 December 1980. The sequence was shot on an empty soundstage which had leftover sand from a previous film, and random civilians were hired off the street to appear as inanimate corpses lying in the sand. The sand was dampened with water, which, through evaporation, resulted in the natural fog effect present in the film.\n\nThe special effects in \"The Beyond\" were achieved via practical methods, and have been noted by scholars as Fulci's \"signature violent set pieces.\" The majority of the special effects-intensive scenes were filmed on sound stages in Italy. Monreale recalled her time spent on set during the effects preparation as the most \"intense,\" due to elaborate setups and hours spent properly achieving Fulci's desired visual outcome. Among these for Monreale was her character's violent death sequence, in which she is viciously mauled by her dog. To achieve the effect, the head of a fake dog was crafted, as well as a layered prosthetic neck which the dog tears open with its teeth. This sequence alone took around three days to complete, with the dummy dog being manually puppeteered. On set, Fulci jokingly referred to the fake dog head as \"Puppola.\"\n\nThe white contact lenses worn by several actors in the film were made of glass and hand-painted with multiple shades of white enamel. They were described by both MacColl and Warbeck as being very uncomfortable; MacColl recalled that after completing the film's finale sequence, both she and Warbeck had difficulty removing them from their eyes. The lenses also obscured the wearer's vision, rendering them completely or nearly-completely blind. Monreale expressed that wearing the lenses was extremely difficult for her; all of her scenes except one required her to wear them, and she had to rely on the film's makeup artist, Maurizio Trani, for assistance navigating the sets. To minimize discomfort, Trani would regularly remove the lenses from the actors' eyes and disinfect them between takes.\n\nOne of the film's more elaborate special effects sequences was the death scene of Martin Avery, who is attacked by a horde of tarantula spiders. According to Trani, crafting the sequence was \"complicated,\" but \"proved to be simpler than expected.\" Special effects designer Giannetto DeRossi created half of a prosthetic mouth for the actor, Michele Mirabella, from latex and a dental cast he obtained from his dentist. While some of the spiders were real, the ones filmed biting at Avery's mouth and face were fake, and controlled with handheld clamps. Close-up shots of Mirabella's real mouth were intercut with ones of his false mouth (including close-ups of a fake tongue) as it is bitten by the spiders, resulting in a seamless image of the attack.\n\nThe special effects during the film's first morgue scene in which a bottle of acid is poured over the face of Mary-Anne were created by effects artist Germano Natali. To achieve the melting effect of the face, real sulfuric acid was dumped over a cast of the actress's face, which was made of a mixture of wax and clay; sulfuric acid dissolves the latter substance. A similar dummy head was created to achieve the effect of the character of Joe's eyeball being gouged.\n\nThe crucifixion of Schweick, shown in the opening sequence, was also achieved via practical methods: holes were cut for Saint-John to conceal his forearms behind the cross, while dummy forearms filled with fake blood reservoirs were attached to the front of the cross. Two additional holes were cut at the ends of the dummy forearms, through which DeRossi inserted his own hands. The result appears as two seamless arms, and allowed for the crucifixion to look authentic, as the hands were motile and could writhe in reaction. Trani's hands appear onscreen as the nailer who completes the crucifixion.\n\nFulci commissioned composer Fabio Frizzi to complete a musical score for the film. Commenting on writing the score, Frizzi said: \"The distinctive aim of the film's soundtrack was to achieve an old goal of mine. I wanted to combine two different instrumental forms I had always loved: the band and the orchestra. When I started writing music some years before, I had learned to combine these two sounds; but for many reasons, the roles of strings and wind instruments were mainly created by keyboards. This time I decided to get serious.\" The score features various instruments, including Mellotron and bass, as well as orchestral and choral arrangements. \"Rolling Stone\" reviewers noted that as the film progresses toward its conclusion, \"Frizzi's score also darkens, growing heavy, underlining the inescapable fate of the characters.\"\n\nIn 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Frizzi's score the 11th-best horror film score of all time. Chris Alexander of ComingSoon.net also ranked the film's main theme, \"Voci Dal Nulla\" (), one of the greatest horror film themes ever composed. In 1981, the score was released in Italy on vinyl through Beat Records Company. On October 30, 2015, the independent record label Death Waltz issued the remastered score on vinyl. A compact disc version had been released previously in 2001 by Dagored Records. Grindhouse Releasing now includes the soundtrack with the Blu-ray release in the USA.\n\nOn October 17, 2019, Eibon Press announced that Grindhouse Releasing had discovered the original recordings of the score for the US \"7 Doors of Death\" cut, and they had collaborated to release a limited-edition CD with a comic book adaptation of the film.\n\n\"The Beyond\" was released theatrically in Italy on 29 April 1981, where it grossed 747,615,662 lire on its initial run; film historian Roberto Curti described this as \"OK business\", noting that while this gross was less than that of Fulci's earlier horror films, the film was widely distributed in other countries, and was especially successful in Spain. In England, the film had difficulty with censors. The BBFC passed it with an X rating demanding several cuts and subsequently included it on the video nasties list. It would not be released in the United Kingdom uncut until 2001 on home video. In Germany, the film was released under the title \"Die Geisterstadt der Zombies\" (). The German theatrical version was the only version of the film in which the pre-credit sequence was printed in color; in the Italian and international versions, the sequence was printed in sepia.\n\"The Beyond\" did not see a U.S. release until 1983, when it was acquired for theatrical distribution by Terry Levine of Aquarius Releasing, a New York City-based distributor who had previously handled regional distribution for John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" (1978). Levine purchased the U.S. distribution rights for around $35,000, and spent an additional $10,000 on additional post-production work, which included replacing Frizzi's music with a new score by Mitch and Ira Yuspeh, as well as truncating it by several minutes in order to achieve an R-rating. Aquarius released this alternate version of the film in the United States on 11 November 1983 under the title \"7 Doors of Death\". According to Levine, the title change was a result of his belief that the original title was too nebulous, and that the film's \"Seven Doors\" plot device was a more interesting narrative hook that would intrigue audiences. To promote this release, Levine screened the film for Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper, the respective co-writer and director of \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" (1974), who granted laudatory quotes about the film to be used in television and print advertisements. Most of the cast and crew names for this version were also \"anglicised\" to appeal to U.S. audiences, with Fulci being credited as \"Louis Fuller\". \"7 Doors of Death\" was a commercial success, grossing $455,652 during its first week of release; Levine estimated that the film turned him a profit of roughly $700,000.\n\nThe uncut version of \"The Beyond\" was not made commercially available in the U.S. until after Fulci's death in 1996. Following the director's passing, the North American distribution rights to the film were acquired by Bob Murawski and Sage Stallone for their company Grindhouse Releasing, which partnered with Quentin Tarantino and Jerry Martinez's Rolling Thunder Pictures and Noah Cowan's Cowboy Booking International to re-release the film through a series of midnight screenings that began in Los Angeles, New York City and five other locations on 12 June 1998, followed by a national roll-out. Remarking on Rolling Thunder's stake in the film, Cowboy Vice-President John Vanco noted that \"Fulci is one of [Tarantino and Martinez's] favorite directors\", and the pair \"wanted to have someone with a little more kind of midnight movie specialized kind of background [to help distribute the film]\". By July 26, the re-release had made $123,843 at the box office. Murawski's ownership of \"The Beyond\"'s U.S. rights proved useful while editing Peter Parker's transformation scene in Sam Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" (2002): due to a lack of money to create original footage, he inserted a brief close-up shot of a spider from Martin's death scene into the sequence, along with footage from Raimi's \"Darkman\" (1990). Grindhouse gave the film a second theatrical re-release in North America to celebrate its 24th anniversary, starting on 9 February 2015 at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Yonkers, New York, and ending on 27 March 2015 in the Music Box Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nUpon the film's 1983 release in the United States as \"7 Doors of Death\", critic Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" deemed the film visually \"elegant,\" but noted: \"as a thriller of the occult it's overly familiar, just another rotting-flesh ghoul parade.\" Bill Kelley of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" similarly praised the film's visual elements, including the sepia prologue, but added: \"The problem is, whenever someone in the film is trying to act, the camera is recording something that's really not worth seeing,\" ultimately classing it as a \"Z-grade horror movie.\"\n\nThe \"Akron Beacon Journal\"s Bill O'Connor criticized the plot for a lack of coherence, writing: \"People get killed all over the hotel. Then, after they're killed, they get ugly.. We never know why they get killed or why they get ugly, which leads me to suspect that maybe this is an art film. At the end of the movie, the dead walk... Then the people leave the movie theater. They look just like the dead people who walked out of the morgue. Maybe this is not an art movie. Maybe this is a documentary.\"\n\nTim Pulleine (\"The Monthly Film Bulletin\") stated that the film allows for \"two or three visually striking passages-and granting that, from Bava onwards, narrative concision has not been the strong suit for Italian horror movies—the film is still completely undone by its wildly disorganized plot.\" The review also critiqued the dub, noting its \"sheer ineptitude\".\n\nUpon its 1998 re-release, critic Roger Ebert deemed it a film \"filled with bad dialogue\" and criticized it for having an incoherent plot. In 2000, he included the film in a book of his \"most-hated\" movies.\n\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Beyond\" holds a 67% approval rating based on 21 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.46/10. AllMovie called the film a \"surreal and bloody horror epic\" and labeled it \"Italian horror at its nightmarish extreme\". \"Time Out\" London, alternatively, called it \"a shamelessly artless horror movie whose senseless story—a girl inherits a spooky, seedy hotel which just happens to have one of the seven doors of Hell in its cellar—is merely an excuse for a poorly connected series of sadistic tableaux of torture and gore.\" Critic John Kenneth Muir wrote in \"Horror Films of 1980s\": \"Fulci's films may be dread-filled excursions into surrealism and dream imagery, but in the real world, they don't hang together, and \"The Beyond\" is Exhibit A.\" A similar sentiment is echoed by Bill Gibron of \"PopMatters\", who wrote of the film in 2007:\n\nIn the years since its release, \"The Beyond\" has acquired a cult following. \"Time Out\" London conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. , \"The Beyond\" placed at number 64 on their top 100 list. Film critic Steven Jay Schneider ranked the film number 71 in his book \"101 Horror Movies You Must See Before You Die\" (2009).\n\nOn 10 October 2000, Grindhouse Releasing co-distributed the film in collaboration with Anchor Bay Entertainment on DVD in both a limited-edition tin-box set, and a standard DVD. Both releases featured the fully uncut 89-minute version of the film. There were only 20,000 limited-edition sets released for purchase. The limited-edition set was packaged in a tin box with alternative cover artwork, including an informative booklet on the film's production as well as various miniature poster replications. The same year, Diamond Entertainment released a DVD edition bearing the \"7 Doors of Death\", which in spite of its usage of the US release title, is uncut at 89 minutes and sourced from the film's laserdisc.\n\nA Blu-ray version of the film was released in Australia on 20 November 2013. Grindhouse Releasing, the film's North American distributor, released the film in 2015 on high-definition Blu-ray in the United States, featuring two Blu-ray discs as well as a CD soundtrack. The distributors also wanted to restore the \"7 Doors\" version, but the original print of this is assumed to be lost. As of 2019, the \"7 Doors\" alternative score prints were discovered, and are in the process of restoration. \"7 Doors\" trailers, TV spots and an interview with Aquarius owner Terry Levene explaining the \"Americanization\" process was included as special features instead. Levene also stated he's very content with the original version being praised and preserved, and admitted he only made the \"7 Doors\" version as a way to gain American interest. As of 2018, a cut version of the film available for streaming via Amazon Video under the \"7 Doors of Death\" title runs approximately 84 minutes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1864145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864145", "title": "Beach soccer", "text": "Beach soccer\n\nBeach soccer, also known as beach football, sand football or beasal, is a variant of association football played on a beach or some form of sand.\n\nThe game emphasises skill, agility and accuracy in shooting at the goal.\n\nWhilst football has been played informally on beaches for many years, the introduction of \"beach soccer\" was an attempt to codify rules for the game. This was done in 1992 by the founders of Beach Soccer Worldwide, a company set up to develop the sport and responsible for the majority of its tournaments to this day. This was a major foundation for what is now known as beach soccer and what has led to the sport rapidly growing in popularity.\n\nThe irregularity of the soft-sand playing surface leads to a totally different style of play than is used in football, with a greater degree of improvisation. The compact field, much smaller than a normal football field, allows players to score from anywhere on the sand, leading to an average of sixty attempts at goal in a single game. With an average scoring rate of one goal every three or four minutes, around eleven goals are scored in total during an average game.\n\nBeach football ( or \"futebol de areia\") started in Brazil, more precisely at Rio de Janeiro. In 1950 the first official tournament was created to unite neighborhood small tourneys that happened since 1940. After huge popularity it has grown to be an international game. The participation of internationally renowned players such as flamboyant Frenchman Eric Cantona, legendary Spanish strikers Michel and Julio Salinas and Brazilian stars such as Romário, Júnior and Zico has helped to expand television coverage to large audiences in over 170 countries worldwide.\n\nBeach soccer had been played recreationally all over the world for many years and in many different formats. In 1992 the laws of the game were envisioned and a pilot event was staged by the founding partners of BSWW in Los Angeles. By 1993, the first professional beach soccer competition was organized at Miami Beach, with teams from the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Italy taking part.\n\nIn April 1994 the first event to be covered by network television transmissions was held on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, and the city hosted the first Beach Soccer World Championship in 1995. The competition was won by the host nation, making Brazil the first-ever World Champions of Beach Soccer. The success of the tournament saw commercial interest begin to match developments on the field, and growing demand for the sport around the world gave rise to the Pro Beach Soccer Tour in 1996.\n\nThe first Pro Beach Soccer Tour included a total of 60 games in two years across South America, Europe, Asia and the United States, attracting major names both on and off the field. Interest generated by the tour in Europe led to the creation of the European Pro Beach Soccer League in 1998, providing a solid infrastructure that would increase the professionalism of the spectacle on all levels. The EPBSL, now known as the Euro BS League, brought promoters together from across the continent and satisfied the demands of the media, sponsors and fans. Only four years on from its creation, the successful first step in the building of a legitimate worldwide competition structure for the sport of pro beach soccer had been taken.\n\nBehind the scenes key developments were also taking place, with the Beach Soccer Company relocating its headquarters to Europe, firstly to Monaco and then Barcelona, before becoming Pro Beach Soccer, S.L. in April 2000. One year later they would join forces with Octagon Koch Tavares, who had continued to organise the World Championships and events in South America, to form a single entity known as Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), with the aim of unifying all major Pro Beach Soccer tournaments in the world under the same structure and providing representation of the sport to major sponsors, the media and FIFA.\n\nThe EPBSL was also flourishing, a nail-biting 2000 season was decided in the closing match of the final tournament when Spain beat Portugal in an intense encounter. The Americas League also took shape, with teams entered from North and South America, whilst the Pro Beach Soccer Tour extended its horizons to the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Mexico, Greece, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nFIFA became the global governing body of the sport in 2005, acknowledging BSWW's framework and organizing the first FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.\n\nThe next four years would see this growth consolidated by further progress both on and off the field, with the EPBSL emerging as the strongest pro beach soccer competition in the world. By 2004, some seventeen nations had entered teams, with this number expected to rise to over stage events.\n\nSuch interest has allowed BSWW to strike major sponsorship deals with international companies including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and MasterCard, who stepped up their involvement in 2004 and are now title sponsors of the Euro BS League. Recognition has also come from FIFA, who have cited BSWW as the major entity behind the creation and growth of Beach Soccer, forming a highly promising partnership that was in its full splendour seen in the 2005 world cup, held in Copacabana Beach, Brazil. France won the first world cup and the next year Brazil won it\nat the same venue. The World Cup has continued to flourish with the first held outside Brazil in 2008, and future World Cups spreading as far out as Tahiti in 2013 and Portugal in 2015\n\nAs of 2017, FIFA and the continental confederations do not host women's beach soccer tournaments. The Asian Beach Games, European Games and South American Beach Games also do not have women's beach soccer tournaments.\n\nThe rules of beach soccer are based on the Laws of the Game of association football, with several modifications.\n\nA beach soccer field is a level sandy area considerably smaller than a regular football field. The field is cleared of pebbles and seashells, along with any other objects which could injure a player.\n\nThe field is rectangular in shape, and the touch line is longer than the goal line.\nThe field dimensions are:\n\nThe penalty area is within 9 m (9.8 yards) of the goals, and is marked by a yellow flag situated in touch. Two red flags opposite each other are at the center of the field to represent the half-way line. The goals are slightly smaller than their standard association football counterparts, being from the ground to the bottom of the crossbar and in width between the inside of each upright.\n\nEach team consists of five players, including the goalkeeper and an unlimited number of substitutions, from a selection of three to five players. Throw-ins and kick-ins mean the pace and flow of the game are much faster than regular football. Shoes are not allowed; players must play in bare feet, although ankle guards are permitted. Goal clearances (the equivalent of a goal kick) are taken by the goalkeeper using their hands to throw the ball and a goal cannot be scored directly from these.\n\nA game lasts thirty-six minutes, and is split up into three twelve-minute periods. Unlike association football, in professional matches the referee is not the sole arbiter of the end of a period. A separate timekeeping official controls the official game clock, which is stopped for stoppages in play, and typically counts down to zero, as in North American sports such as basketball and ice hockey. Draws are not permitted, with the game going into three minutes of extra time, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still on level terms after normal time. Unlike football, penalty kicks are directly decided by sudden death rules.\n\nBeach soccer has two on-field referees who co-operatively referee the game. They are assisted by a third referee, who acts in a manner similar to football's fourth official and a timekeeper.\n\nAs in football, yellow and red cards can be issued. Unlike in football, the team can then bring on a substitute to replace the dismissed player after two minutes. Similar to a power play in ice hockey, this period of numerical advantage ends early if the penalised team concedes a goal.\n\nFree kicks are awarded for various fouls. All free kicks are direct free kicks which has to be taken by the player who was fouled, unless awarded for deliberate handling. The laws specify that all players apart from the opposing goalkeeper must clear a zone between the kicker and the goal. Because of this and the small playing area, all free kicks represent a good opportunity to score. Penalties are awarded for fouls within the penalty area.\n\n\nThe following are main beach soccer competitions:\n\n\n\nAFC (Asian Football Confederation):\nCAF (Confederation of African Football):\nCONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football):\nCONMEBOL (South American Football Confederation):\nOFC (Oceania Football Confederation):\nUEFA (Union of European Football Associations):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864153", "title": "Fluorine deficiency", "text": "Fluorine deficiency\n\nFluoride or fluorine deficiency is a disorder which may cause increased dental caries (or tooth decay, is the breakdown of dental tissues by the acidic products released by the \"bacterial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates.\") and possibly osteoporosis (a bone disorder which leads to a decrease in bone mass, and an increase in bone fragility), due to a lack of fluoride in the diet. Common dietary sources of fluoride include tea, grape juice, wine, raisins, some seafoods, coffee, and tap water that has been fluoridated. The extent to which the condition truly exists, and its relationship to fluoride poisoning has given rise to some controversy. Fluorine is not considered to be an essential nutrient, but the importance of fluorides for preventing tooth decay is well-recognized, although the effect is predominantly topical. Prior to 1981, the effect of fluorides was thought to be largely systemic and preeruptive, requiring ingestion. Fluoride is considered essential in the development and maintenance of teeth by the American Dental Hygienists' Association. Fluoride is also essential as it incorporates into the teeth to form and harden teeth enamels so that the teeth are more acid resistant as well as more resistant to cavity forming bacteria. Caries-inhibiting effects of fluoride were first believed to have been seen in 1902 when fluoride in high concentrations was found to stain teeth and prevent tooth decay.\n\nFluoride salts, particularly sodium fluoride (NaF), are used in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Symptoms such as fractured hips in the elderly or brittle and weak bones are caused due to fluorine deficiency in the body. Fluoride stimulates bone formation and increases bone density, however bone with excess fluoride content has an abnormal structure resulting in increased fragility. Thus fluoride therapy results in large increases in bone mineral density but the effect on fracture rates, while positive, is small.\n\nDisputes over the essentiality of fluorine date back to the 19th century, when fluorine was observed in teeth and bones. In 1973 a trial found reduced reproduction in mice fed fluorine-deficient diets, but a subsequent investigation determined that this was due to reduced iron absorption.\n\nFluoride has proven to be an essential element with preventative and protective properties. Fluoride is capable of combating and working against tooth decay and increases resistance to the \"demineralisation of tooth enamel during attack by acidic bacterias\". While essential for all individuals, it is significant for children, as when ingested, the fluoride is incorporated into their developing enamel. This in turn causes their teeth to become less prone to decay. Therefore, a relationship can be formulated, in that the more fluoride entering the body, the overall decline in the rate of decay.\n\nFluorine is the 13th most aboundant element in the Earth's crust. The ionic form of fluorine is called fluoride. Fluoride is most commonly found as inorganic or organic fluorides such as naturally occurring calcium fluoride or synthetic sodium fluoride. There are a number of sources of fluoride, these include:\n\nIn Australia fluoride occurs naturally within water supplies, at a concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/L. However, this number varies amongst different populations, as specific fluoridated communities exceed this amount, ranging from 0.6-1.0 mg/L of fluoride present. \nThe process of incorporating more fluoride into water systems is an affordable mechanism that can provide many beneficial effects in the long term.\n\nFluoride toothpaste came into production in the 1890s, after its benefits were investigated. This product has become available to most industrialised countries, and within Australia accounts for \"90% of total toothpaste purchased\".\n\nFluoride supplements were first recognised and highly suggested by health professionals, in areas where the practice of fluoridating water was not accepted. Such mechanisms are recommended for individuals, primarily children (whom of which are at a greater risk of caries) in low-fluoride areas.\n\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for some minerals in 1997. Where there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) was used instead. AIs are typically matched to actual average consumption, with the assumption that there appears to be a need, and that need is met by what people consume. The current AI for women 19 years and older is 3.0 mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). The AI for men is 4.0 mg/day. The AI for children ages 1–18 increases from 0.7 to 3.0 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of fluoride the UL is 10 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women ages 18 and older the AI is set at 2.9 mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). For men the value is 3.4 mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.6 to 3.2 mg/day. These AIs are comparable to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA reviewed safety evidence and set an adult UL at 7.0 mg/day (lower for children).\n\n"}

Among his classmates were Maurice Boitel and Louis Vuillermoz. He met the French painter Marie-Thérèse Auffray and was influenced by her work.\n\nSustained by the picture-dealer Maurice Garnier, Buffet produced religious pieces, landscapes, portraits and still-lifes. In 1946, he had his first painting shown, a self-portrait, at the Salon des Moins de Trente Ans at the Galerie Beaux-Arts. He had at least one major exhibition every year. Buffet illustrated \"Les Chants de Maldoror\" written by Comte de Lautréamont in 1952. In 1955, he was awarded the first prize by the magazine Connaissance des Arts, which named the ten best post-war artists. In 1958, at the age of 30, the first retrospective of his work was held at the Galerie Charpentier.\n\nPierre Bergé was Buffet's live-in lover until Bergé left Buffet for Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nOn 12 December 1958, Buffet married the writer and actress Annabel Schwob. They adopted three children. Daughter Virginie was born in 1962, daughter Danielle in 1963 and son Nicolas was born in 1973. Bernard Buffet was named \"Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur\" in 1973. \n\nOn 23 November 1973, the Bernard Buffet Museum was founded by Kiichiro Okano, in Surugadaira, Japan.\n\nAt the request of the French postal administration in 1978, he designed a stamp depicting the Institut et le Pont des Arts – on this occasion the Post Museum arranged a retrospective of his works.\n\nBuffet created more than 8,000 paintings and many prints as well.\n\nBuffet committed suicide at his home in Tourtour, southern France, on 4 October 1999. He was suffering from Parkinson's disease and was no longer able to work. Police said that Buffet died around 4 p.m after putting his head in a plastic bag attached around his neck with tape.\n\nThe popularity of Buffet's work, as well as the level of media attention around his lifestyle, were quite high in the 1950s and 1960s. Although he kept on painting throughout his life, there was a certain decline in interest in his work in the last decades of the 20th century, especially so in France. This decline in popularity was partly influenced by his fall from grace with French art pundits, whose support and interest shifted away from figurative art. \n\nIn the 21st century, there has been a renewed spike in interest in the work of Bernard Buffet. With some successful exhibitions in France and throughout the world.

{"id": "1864178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864178", "title": "Monteagle Mountain", "text": "Monteagle Mountain\n\nMonteagle Mountain is the local name given to a stretch of Interstate 24 near Monteagle, Tennessee that travels over the Cumberland Plateau. Being part of the plateau, it is not technically a mountain, but appears that way to motorists crossing over it. It is frequently referenced as one of the most treacherous stretches of highway in the United States, especially in inclement weather. It rises to an elevation of around , with gradients of 6%.\n\nThe section of I-24 known, tautologically, as Monteagle Mountain consists of a more than segment in Grundy and Marion counties that includes both the eastern and western escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. I-24 also travels concurrently with U.S. Route 64 (US 64) through this section. I-24 crosses the plateau in its narrowest section, which appears as an hourglass shape on maps. Monteagle Mountain is best known for its eastern descent, but its western descent is also one of the most hazardous stretches of Interstate Highway as well. Compared to grades elsewhere, Monteagle's 4–6% grade over a period of several miles does not come close to the steepest. The route contains six lanes over the eastern escarpment, with the extra lane on the westbound side serving as a truck climbing lane, and four lanes over the western escarpment. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) has yet to construct a truck lane on the western descent.\n\nOn the eastern descent of the plateau, the eastbound lanes contain a 6% grade over a length of about where the elevation drops , and is particularly hazardous to truckers. At the top of this downgrade is a truck inspection station, and this downgrade also contains two runaway truck ramps, which are on the left due to the terrain. The speed limit on the eastbound lanes reduces to and for trucks, while on the westbound lanes it reduces to , with no separate restrictions for trucks.\n\nThe eastern downgrade of Monteagle Mountain also contains the third-widest median of any Interstate Highway, with the others being I-8 through the In-Ko-Pah grade in California and I-84 through the Cabbage Hill grade east of Pendleton, Oregon.. There is more than between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other, and are located on what was originally US 64. \n\nThe western downgrade of Monteagle Mountain on I-24, while not considered as hazardous, contains many curves, including one \"c-shaped\" curve, protracted over a distance of almost . The eastbound and westbound lanes are also located very close together, and crossover crashes and crashes with Jersey barriers located in the median in some places are common on this stretch. This segment also features off-ramp approach-style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. The speed limit on the westbound lanes, of this stretch is and for trucks, while on the eastbound lanes it is , with no separate restrictions for trucks. \n\nThe approximately on top of the mountain, which contains exits with US 41 and US 41A, is not hazardous, but maintains the speed limit. A rest area is located at the top of the western escarpment of Monteagle Mountain.\n\nEast of the grade, the route passes through straight plains with slight banked curves as it enters Kimball and South Pittsburg. West of the grade, the route enters the relatively flat terrain of the Eastern Highland Rim.\n\nThe mountain was part of the Cherokee homeland until 1817. The mountain was named \"Eagle Mountain\" by the Cherokee because of the great number of golden eagles that roosted and nested along its ridge line. In fact, in honor of those birds, for many years a golden eagle sat in the park in Monteagle until it was stolen as a school prank. It now sits in display at Tennessee Technological University.\n\nAfter the Cherokee were removed, the area was renamed \"Moffit's Station\" in May 1870 by John Moffat, a native of Glasgow, Scotland, with his wife and children. It would later become \"Moffat Station\" and still later, the city of Monteagle.\n\nUS 41 was constructed across the mountain in 1923, which was then known as the Dixie Highway and State Route 2 (SR 2). It later became US 64, and was upgraded to a two-lane road with additional truck climbing lanes on both of the downgrades for a total of three lanes.\n\nI-24 was constructed across the mountain between 1962 and 1968 by grandfathering in and improving the original segment of US 64. The route on the western downgrade of the mountain was widened to four lanes, and the eastern downgrade with two westbound and one eastbound lane was connected to I-24 while the westbound lanes were constructed. Construction on the westbound lanes was completed in 1973, and the three original lanes of US 41 on the eastern downgrade were converted to the eastbound lanes of I-24. \n\nBeginning in April 1985, the eastbound lanes of I-24 on the eastern downgrade of Monteagle Mountain were extensively straightened and rebuilt, and the grades reduced. The project also added left shoulders and an additional runaway truck ramp. This work was completed in 1989, and the lanes were reopened on July 11 of that year in a ceremony officiated by then-governor Ned McWherter. The project experienced many setbacks including geological problems, which delayed the project, and the inspection station and additional runaway truck ramp were not planned. Originally targeted for completion in December 1987 at a cost of $17 million, the final cost was $29.5 million. During this time both directions of traffic were routed to the westbound lanes of I-24. After the project was completed, eastbound I-24 was reopened, this time with a new truck climbing lane. A truck station to allow for the adjustment of brakes opened in January 1992.\n\nAfter the safety improvements were completed, accidents in the eastbound lanes of this stretch dropped from 54 in 1983 to 3 in 1991.\n\n"}

The Hill is part of the Ten Schools Admissions Organization (TSAO).\n\nThe school is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools.\n\nThe Hill School was founded in 1851 by the Rev. Matthew Meigs as the Family Boarding School for Boys and Young Men. However, it has been known as the Hill School since at least 1874.\n\nThe school opened on May 1, 1851, enrolling 25 boys for the first year. According to Paul Chancellor's \"The History of The Hill School: 1851-1976\", “He [Meigs] wanted to stress that he was not founding still another academy, but a type of school quite new and rare in America. There is a tendency to think that the boys’ boarding school as we know it existed as long as there have been private schools. It has not... The Hill was the first to be founded as a \"family boarding school\" (a school where the students lived on campus), as opposed to boarding with families in the town.\n\nIn 1998, the school became coeducational, enrolling 88 girls in its first year.\n\nIn the early 20th century, The Hill was a feeder school for Princeton University; a prominent \"The Hill School Club\" operated at Princeton for the benefit of alumni. The prevalence of Hill alumni, as well as those of Lawrenceville, Hotchkiss, Exeter and Phillips Academy at Princeton led F. Scott Fitzgerald to lament that it was those of 'lesser' preparatory schools which were more prepared for the fray. The admissions process was relaxed for Hill School students, with cases including George Garrett, Princeton 1952, who was admitted when he confessed that he liked the striped football uniforms. At one point, Lawrenceville and Hill sent more students to Princeton than all public schools combined Today, Hill alumni attend a wide variety of colleges.\n\nThe Hill School offers classes in each of its nine academic departments and offers 28 Advanced Placement courses.\n\nThe Hill School offers classes in Chinese, French, Spanish, Arabic, Latin, and Ancient Greek.\n\nThe Hill School has had a relationship with Charterhouse School in the United Kingdom since 1994 that includes instructional trips, along with exchanges of extracurricular programs and teachers. It is linked with the Maru a Pula School in Botswana. As well, the Hill hosts a Thai King's Scholar every year. The Hill School is a participating school in the Naval Academy Foundation Prep Program.\n\nIn the early days of the school, boys played shinney, town ball, football and cricket. Matthew Meigs was not an athlete, yet allowed sporting pursuits, unlike his contemporaries such as Samuel Taylor of Phillips Academy. During John Meigs' tenure as headmaster, organized and interscholastic sports began at The Hill. Tennis became the dominant sport during this period, unlike baseball at other schools.\n\nThe Hill School is a member of the Mid-Atlantic Prep League (MAPL), which the School joined in 1998. The Hill School was a charter member of the Pennsylvania Independent Schools Athletic Association (PAISAA), which became an officially sanctioned organization in 2011. In 2014, The Hill School received associate membership in the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC).\n\nThe Hill School's rivalry with Lawrenceville dates back to 1887, and is the fifth-oldest high school rivalry in the United States. Originally an annual football game, the schools now compete against each other in all of the fall sports on either the first or second weekend in November.\n\nPeddie School also maintains a \"Hill Day\" during which several teams from Hill and Peddie compete.\n\nParticipation in athletics is considered a key part of a Hill education. All third and fourth form students are required to participate in at least two seasons of interscholastic sports, and all fifth and sixth formers must play at least one interscholastic season. Students may fulfill a season requirement by serving as a student athletic trainer or team manager.\n\nThe Hill School has been described as different in style and spirit from its counterparts in New England, and has been described as strict and demanding. It has also been described as conservative.\n\nAlumnus Oliver Stone described his experience at The Hill School: \"I hated the Hill School at the time. It was monastic. Horrible food, no girls. It was truly one of those Charles Dickens’ types of experiences.. And I really hated it. Years later I came to appreciate it. I think the inquiry and above all the discipline, of studying and concentrating and sitting down and doing it.\" The Hill has been criticized, alongside other East Coast Protestant schools, for promoting \"snobbish\", undemocratic, and \"un-American values\".\n\nE. Digby Baltzell's book \"The Protestant Establishment\" identified the Hill School as one of the \"select sixteen\" best boarding schools in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two of the 21 richest Nouveau riche families sent their sons to The Hill.\n\nThe school was used as a filming location in the 2009 movie \"The Mighty Macs\".\n\nHeadmasters of The Hill School since its founding in 1851:\n\n"}

{"id": "1864199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864199", "title": "Garden railway", "text": "Garden railway\n\nA garden railroad or garden railway (\"railroad\" in the US, \"railway\" elsewhere) is a model railway system set up outdoors in a garden. While G is the most popular scale for garden railroads, 16 mm scale has a dedicated and growing following especially in the UK. Model locomotives in this scale are often live steam scale models of British narrow gauge prototypes. 16 mm scale (which runs on ) track, the same gauge as O gauge is probably now more popular in the UK than G scale.\n\nA garden railway's scale tends to be in the range of 1/32 (Gauge 1) to 1/12 (1:12), running on either or gauge track. 1/32 scale (1:32) is also called \"three-eighths scale\" meaning 3/8 of an inch on the model represents one foot on the real thing. For similar reasons, 1/24 scale (1:24) is also called \"half-inch scale\". Other popular scales are 1:29, 1:20.3 (representing gauge prototypes on track, 16 mm (1:19). They are smaller than the Backyard railroad, or what is commonly called a miniature railway, and would not provide a ride-on facility, being intended instead as a display railway. Smaller scales and gauges are used in the garden, but in general garden railway is used to refer to the medium scale sizes which would be impractical to use indoors.\n\nAt its most basic level, a garden railway works just like an indoor railway, including turnouts and turntables. However, special considerations must be taken for everything from sunlight and water to dirt and leaves, and even wildlife. The distance covered also means that electrical resistance in and between sections is much higher, and electrical power will tend to drop off at the far end.\n\nTo eliminate this power issue, some are rigged to use RC car parts such as rechargeable batteries. Others even use live steam and run as a real steam locomotive would. The steam can be generated from a variety of sources, ranging from messy solid pellet (i.e. methenamine) or sterno-type fuel, through clean-burning butane gas, to prototypical coal burners. Live steam is particularly widespread amongst 16 mm scale garden railway enthusiasts.\n\nMany trains also have digital audio on board, so they sound like a real train. They can also use Digital Command Control or other similar systems, though dirty outdoor track can cause less of a problem with signal than with simple DC power. This is because DCC puts the full voltage on the rails at all times. There are many benefits of DCC when compared to DC analog systems.\n\nPlants are usually an integral part of a garden railway, and dwarf varieties along with pruning are often used to keep them in proper proportion. Some go so far as to use bonsai techniques, though this can be very time-consuming for large areas.\n\nBuildings are also often used in a garden railway, though they too must be constructed to withstand the weather. Train stations and freight depots are popular, some even building whole towns trackside. The loco shed is a common place to store a locomotive (or the whole train) when not in use.\n\nOther geographic features are used, such as a small pond to represent a lake, rocks for boulders, or tunnels through \"mountains\" or under stairways. Tunnels can be a particular , because everything from cats to raccoons and more like to hide in them, particularly to get out of the rain or heat, sometimes even to sleep, nest, or hibernate. A derailment inside a tunnel can also be permanent if careful planning is not done to ensure that it can be reached by access panels (trapdoors) or at arm's length from either end.\n\nA frequent theme is the railway in an idealised urban or rural environment, so it is often found in the context of a model village. Some garden railways work opposite to the model village style and opt more for a railway in the garden, where the railways runs amongst normal plants, not in scale with the railway. These sort of railway designs allow for large scale planting and many gardeners have the railway as a secondary hobby to gardening.\n\nBecause these layouts are often unique, they are frequently given names by their owners, just like a real railroad. Some are very natural-sounding, as if they were real. Other names are playful or even silly.\n\nNumerous garden rail societies have been formed around the world. Members often invite others over for social gatherings, as well as rotating club meetings around each month. A large setup was on public display at the Atlanta Botanical Garden during the summer and early fall of 2005, including replicas of downtown Atlanta skyscrapers made from wood, bark, and other natural materials.\n\nIn Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory features an extensive Garden Railway display put on with the cooperation of many Wisconsin Model Railroad club members. The \"Domes\" as they are known locally, schedules the indoor Garden Railway Show during the cold winter months. It has become one of the most popular displays each year and one of the largest temporary Garden Railway displays in the Midwest.\n\nA notable example in England is Bekonscot which is the oldest model village in the world and has an extensive railway running through a mythical 1930s England. This is well known to be one of the largest, and oldest, garden railways in the UK open to the public.\n\nFor historical reasons, the situation is complex.\n\n'G' track width is . If used to represent track, this corresponds to a scale of 1:32. This gauge, but not the scale, is derived from the standard gauge 'Gauge 1' in UK (originally using a scale of 10mm to 1 foot).\n\nThe same gauge of , if used to represent a track, a commonly used Narrow Gauge\nin many countries i.e. Australia, Africa, corresponds to a scale of 1:24. \n\nThe same gauge of , if used to represent a track, corresponds to a scale of 1:22.5 (IIm).\n\nThe same gauge of , if used to represent a track, corresponds to a scale of 1:20.3 .\n\nThe same gauge of , if used to represent a track, corresponds to a scale of 1:13.5 SE scale, near 1:12 or 1 inch to the foot. This larger scale is increasing in popularity.\n\nA track gauge of , if used to represent a track of , or just under, corresponds to a scale of 1:19. Sometimes, the 1:19 rolling stock, and particularly live steam locomotives, is equipped for a track of ('G' track). This scale is also called 16 mm in UK, where it is mainly found, because it represents 16 mm for 1 ft.\n\nThe same gauge of , if used to represent a track, corresponds to a scale of 1:13.5, and this larger scale is increasing in popularity.\n\nThe same gauge of , if used to represent a track, corresponds to a scale of 1:12. This combination is not common but has a small number of dedicated followers.\n\nA US manufacturer (Aristocraft) decided to create a new scale of 1:29 for standard gauge trains on 45 mm track; filling the need for mass-produced American prototypes in a market otherwise dominated by European outline trains. At the time (1988), 45mm track was the most common track worldwide. The choice of 1:29 was an attempt to create cars and engines that would compare favorably in size with existing LGB rolling stock which dominated the hobby, and to increase the \"wow\" factor by making the trains 30% larger by volume than standard 1:32 scale trains. In addition 1:29 is exactly three times the size of HO scale making it easier to enlarge existing scale model drawings for consumer construction of accessories and scratch-built engines and rolling stock. Since this original venture, at least two other major companies have joined in the 1:29th market (USA Trains and AML/American Mainline) as well as some other smaller companies creating a wide range of rolling stock and locomotives. Early releases in this scale were more toy like, complete with brass railings and other decorations. Since that time there has been a steady move toward more and more realism with recent releases in live steam radio controlled engines. 1:29 is predominantly American mainline although some locomotives and rolling stock are made for the European market.\n\nIf one will represent a modern epoch, there is need for road cars and trucks which are only offered in 1:18, 1:24 and 1:32 scale. Modellers are making compromises and 1:22.5 trains are commonly associated with 1:24 accessories (figures, animals, cars, etc.)\n\nThere is a conflict on the designation of 'G' scale (created by LGB), the NMRA was initially willing to use it only for scale 1:22.5 but manufacturers hoping to benefit from the notoriety of the 'G' naming continue using this reference for scales 1:20.3, 1:24, 1:29, and 1:32. All these scales would more correctly fall under the name of G gauge, referencing the width of the track, rather than G scale, as there are so many scales now claiming to be G. A recent move has been made to separate all the G gauge scales, the primary one being the use of F scale for 1:20.3.\n\nIn short:\n\nScale 1:22.5 is mainly used for narrow gauge equipment and propose a large choice of trains, buildings and accessories (American or European) and allow low radiuses curves, locomotives and cars being shorts.\nScale G64 (), which is the proper width for standard gauge trains at scale 1:22.5 began to develop in UK, but only with UK trains. Large radiuses are required due to the length of cars.\n\nAmerican or European quality equipment can be found at scale 1:32, at a cost.\n\nThere exists a few garden trains at a smaller scale but maintenance is more difficult.\nAnd the scale '0' with standard gauge run on a track of and is actually at scale of 1:43.5 in France & UK, 1:45 in Germany and 1:48 in the USA...\n\nThese will be used to provide citation links:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1864205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864205", "title": "Matthew 1:18", "text": "Matthew 1:18\n\nMatthew 1:18 is the eighteenth verse of the first chapter in the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. This verse opens the description of the events surrounding the birth of Jesus.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:18\n\nAs the previous verses contained nothing but a summary of Jesus' genealogy, this verse is the beginning of the narrative of Matthew, and has often been considered the true opening verse of the gospel. Boring notes that this verse is not part of the narrative to come, but is an initial introduction bringing the reader up to date on where things stand at the beginning of Matthew's story.\n\nThe word translated as birth, \"geneseos\", is the same term that is used in . English editions invariably give different translations for the two, but the author of Matthew may have been trying to link the two verses with the second \"geneseos\" symbolically beginning the second section of the chapter.\n\nThe word translated as espoused, engaged, or most often betrothed refers to a specific institution of the period very different from the modern idea of an engagement. This period occurred after the main marriage ceremony had taken place and the marriage contracts had been signed. Dissolution thus required a formal divorce or the death of one partner. In general the betrothal ceremony took place when the woman was still very young, generally around age twelve or thirteen. After the ceremony she would remain in their father's house for around a year, and this period is what is referred to in this verse.\n\nThe second stage of the marriage was for the husband to take his bride into his own home. Most scholars believe this is what the phrase \"coming together\" means in this verse. It is not thought to be a euphemism for sexual relations, even though it could be interpreted in this way. Only after the bride moved into her husband's house would the marriage be consummated. In Judea sexual relations during the betrothal were not unheard of. In Galilee, however, much stricter conventions prevailed. Any infidelity with an outside partner during the betrothal period was considered adultery, and punished as such under Mosaic Law. Thus when Mary became pregnant she was at a point prior to which she would have had relations with her husband but also a time in which infidelity would be harshly punished, potentially by death.\n\nMatthew does not relate the events surrounding the conception of Jesus, rather he takes the event as having already happened. To Schweizer this signals that Matthew was writing for an audience that was already well aware of story of the Virgin Birth. Schweizer also observes that the author of Matthew seems rather nonplussed by the Virgin Birth. While today modern scientifically oriented Christians find the Virgin Birth one of the more implausible parts of the Gospel, Schweizer believes that attitudes would have been very different at the time Matthew was writing. There were several Virgin Birth stories in the Jewish tradition and the idea of virgin births was generally accepted by the population.\n\nMatthew mentions the paternity of the Holy Ghost very quickly, even before any of the characters in his narrative are aware of this fact. Brown argues that this is because Matthew does not want the reader to consider alternate scenarios as to how Mary could have become pregnant. Jane Schaberg sees this as an apologetic addition, to counter claims of Jesus' illegitimacy that were current among anti-Christian writings of the time, such as the \"Toledot Yeshu\". She links this to Matthew 28, where the author of Matthew tries to rebut the theory that Jesus' body was stolen.\n\nDespite the capital letters most editions give the phrase, Matthew does not mean the Holy Ghost as understood in modern theology. The modern notion of the Trinity developed over time. The phrase can be read as either \"\"the\" holy spirit\" or \"\"a\" holy spirit.\" In Greek the term Holy Ghost is gender neutral and in Semitic languages it is female. This reduces the idea of actual copulation, as was traditional between pagan gods and mortal women. Feminist scholar Levine sees much importance in Jesus being the child of a woman and feminine spirit. She sees this as a rejection of the traditional patriarchal model for the family. Wainwright also sees the act of creating a child without the need for a mortal man as a challenge to the androcentric social order. Schaberg disagrees with this approach, writing that Mary is represented in these verses as nothing more than a vehicle reproduction, a very traditional societal role.\n\nIn Insular Gospel Books (that is those books produced in monasteries Ireland, England and Scotland or on the continent in monasteries founded by Irish missionaries) this verse has an importance not seen in other medieval Gospel Books. In the Vulgate (which was used in these books), the verse reads:\n\nIn medieval writing the word \"Christ\" was often abbreviated using the Greek letters Chi (X) and Rho (P). The word \"Christi\" (of Christ) was then written XPi. The verses through give the genealogy of Christ, with the actual narrative of Christ's birth starting at Matthew 1:18. Insular scribes treated Matthew 1:1-17 as an almost separate work from the rest of Matthew. Insular scribes also started a tradition of giving the opening few words of each of the Gospels an elaborate decorative treatment (see example from the Lindisfarne Gospels). Accordingly, the Insular scribes gave the opening Chi Rho monogram an increasingly elaborate decoration. This trend culminated in the Book of Kells (\"pictured\"), where the monogram has taken over the entire page. Although later scribes (such as those of the Carolingian Renaissance) followed the Insular tradition of giving elaborate decorative treatments to the opening words of texts, including the Gospels, they did not follow the tradition of decoration this verse. The presence of a decorated Chi Rho monogram within a manuscript can then be seen as indicative of Insular influence.\n"}
{"id": "1864217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864217", "title": "Methodius of Olympus", "text": "Methodius of Olympus\n\nSaint Methodius of Olympus (died c. 311) was a Christian bishop, ecclesiastical author and martyr today regarded as a Church Father. He is commemorated on June 20.\n\nFew reports have survived on the life of this first systematic opponent of Origen; even these short accounts present many difficulties. Eusebius does not mention him in his \"Church History\", probably because he opposed various theories of Origen. We are indebted to Saint Jerome for the earliest accounts of him. According to him, Methodius was Bishop of Olympos in Lycia and afterwards Bishop of Tyre. No later Greek author knows anything of his being Bishop of Tyre; and according to Eusebius, Tyrannio was Bishop of Tyre during the persecutions of Diocletian and died a martyr; after the persecution Paulinus was elected bishop of the city. Later sources make him bishop not of Olympos but of Patara, also in Lycia. It has been conjecture that he could have held both sees simultaneously, but this is unlikely.\n\nJerome further states that Methodius suffered martyrdom at the end of the last persecution, i.e., under Maximinus Daia (311). Although he then adds, \"that some assert\", that this may have happened under Decius and Valerian at Chalcis, this statement (\"ut alii affirmant\"), adduced even by him as uncertain, is unlikely. Various attempts have been made to clear up the error concerning the mention of Tyre as a subsequent bishopric of Methodius; it is possible that he was transported to Tyre during the persecution and died there.\n\nMethodius had a comprehensive philosophical education, and was an important theologian as well as a prolific and polished author. Chronologically, his works can only be assigned in a general way to the end of the third and the beginning of the 4th century. He became of special importance in the history of theological literature, in that he combated various views of the great Alexandrian, Origen. He particularly attacked his doctrine that man's body at the resurrection is not the same body as he had in life, as well as his idea of the world's eternity. Nevertheless, he recognized the great services of Origen in ecclesiastical theology.\n\nLike Origen, he is strongly influenced by Plato's philosophy, and uses to a great extent the allegorical explanation of Scripture. Of his numerous works only one has come down to us complete in a Greek text: the dialogue on virginity, under the title \"Symposium, or on Virginity\" (\"Symposion e peri hagneias\"). In the dialogue, composed with reference to Plato's \"Symposium\", he depicts a festive meal of ten virgins in the garden of Arete, at which each of the participators extols Christian virginity and its sublime excellence. It concludes with a hymn on Jesus as the Bridegroom of the Church. Larger fragments are preserved of several other writings in Greek; we know of other works from old versions in Slavonic, though some are abbreviated.\n\nThe following works are in the form of dialogue:\n\nWhile large portions of the original Greek text of both these writings are preserved, we have only Slavonic versions of the four following shorter treatises:\n\nOf other writings, no longer extant, Jerome mentions (loc. cit.) a voluminous work against Porphyry, the Neoplatonist who had published a book against Christianity; a treatise on the \"Pythonissa\" directed against Origen, commentaries on Genesis and the Canticle of Canticles. Other authors attributed a work \"On the Martyrs\", and a dialogue \"Xenon\" to Methodius; in the latter he opposes the doctrine of Origen on the eternity of the world. Gregory Abu'l Faraj attribute to Methodius some kind of work dealing with the patriarchs.\n\nThe 7th-century Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius is falsely attributed to him. His feast day is September 18. Among the editions of his works are: P.G., XVIII; Jahn, \"S. Methodii opera et S. Methodius platonizans\" (Halle, 1865); Bonwetsch, \"Methodius von Olympus: I, Schriften\" (Leipzig, 1891).\n\nSix brief points summarize his contribution concerning Revelation:\n\nMethodius taught that Jesus Christ remained a virgin His whole life as an example for men:\n\n\"What then did the Lord, the Truth and the Light, accomplish on coming down to the world? He preserved His flesh incorrupt in virginity with which he had adorned it. And so let us too, if we are to come to the likeness of God, endeavor to aspire to the virginity of Christ.\" (Symposium 1.5)\n\n\n\n"}

He has also worked with Industrial Light and Magic on films including \"\" and \"\". The Federation battleships and podracers are some of Belleci's pieces.\n\nBelleci has a long history of working with fire and explosives. At an early age, his father showed him how to make a Molotov cocktail. He later built what was essentially a homemade flamethrower. The device caused a problem when he accidentally lit part of his house on fire. When he was 19, he was nearly arrested for setting off a homemade pipe bomb near his parents' home in Seaside, California. The officer encouraged young Belleci to find a way of expressing his love for explosions and special effects that did not involve getting arrested. Belleci was raised and is a devout Christian.\n\nIn 1994, after graduating from San Francisco State University's film school, he started working with Jamie Hyneman at M5 Industries. Belleci worked as a stage manager, running errands and cleaning the shop, but quickly moved up the ranks. A few years later, he started work at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM). Belleci worked for ILM for eight years as a model builder, sculptor, and painter. Belleci began work on Discovery Channel's \"MythBusters\", in 2003, doing work behind the scenes and, in the second season, was featured as part of the show's build team. In the show's third season, he received on-screen credit. In 2005, Belleci persuaded fellow ILM veteran Grant Imahara to join the show, following the departure of original cast member Scottie Chapman.\n\nBelleci worked on: the \"Matrix\" trilogy, \"Van Helsing\", \"Peter Pan\", \"Starship Troopers\", \"Galaxy Quest\" and \"Bicentennial Man\".\n\nOne of his short films, \"SandTrooper\", has appeared on Syfy and in the Slamdance Film Festival.\n\nBelleci is often considered by fellow MythBusters Kari Byron and Grant Imahara to be more of a daredevil and, as such, often performs the more dangerous stunts when testing a myth. These have included: testing the \"Red Flag to a Bull\" myth; testing the myth that a human's tongue will instantly stick to a frozen pole, in the \"Snow Special\" episode; and the myth \"can you stay underwater for an hour while breathing through a dart tube?\", in the \"Ninja Movie Myths 2\" episode. One of his more popular stunts, shown several times on the show, was an attempt to jump over a toy wagon on a bicycle; the attempt failed, resulting in Belleci flipping forward and landing on his face. The bike almost hit Belleci's head. As a result of doing these stunts, he is often involved in comical accidents while testing myths. According to the October 28, 2012, episode of \"MythBusters\", he suffers from acrophobia.\n\nDuring the \"Hollywood Hang\" sequence, of the 2010 episode \"Soda Cup Killer\", Belleci fell off a roof, and despite being strapped into a safety harness system, landed in an open window ledge below the drop point, and hurt his leg causing substantial bleeding.\n\nHe and Byron made a guest appearance on the October 3, 2012, episode of the Discovery series \"Sons of Guns\". They test-fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop and watched as the staff re-tested a myth previously busted by the Build Team: that a propane tank could explode if struck by a bullet.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, it was announced that Belleci, along with co-stars Byron and Imahara, would be leaving \"MythBusters\".\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, he co-hosted \"Punkin Chunkin\" on the Science Channel with fellow \"MythBusters\" build team members Kari Byron and Grant Imahara.\n\nIn 2013 Belleci created a YouTube channel entitled \"Blow It Up\", where he and various guests use explosives to blow up everyday items.\n\nIn 2015, Byron and Belleci hosted \"Thrill Factor\", a new show for the Travel Channel. In this show they visit and showcase thrill rides around the world and explore a little bit of science such as the effect of G forces on breathing, heart rate and other factors.\n\nBelleci stars alongside Imahara and Byron in the Netflix show \"White Rabbit Project\" which premiered on December 9, 2016.\n\nBelleci will star alongside Richard Hammond (\"Top Gear\", \"The Grand Tour\") for an untitled Amazon Video series announced in August 2019 to be produced by Hammond's Chimp Productions. The six-episode series will strand the two on a deserted island via shipwreck, and the two will use available resources to build out the means to survive on the island.\n\nFrom June 5–11, 2014, Belleci competed with electronic dance music producer deadmau5 in the Gumball 3000 race riding co-pilot in deadmau5's Ferrari 458 Spider named Purrari from Miami to Ibiza, Spain, and won top honors taking away the \"Spirit of the Gumball\" award.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2018, Belleci proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Erin B.\n\nDuring \"MythBusters\"' 2010 break, Belleci volunteered time to visit Haiti.

About a third (actually 38.1% in 2006) of the population is Catholic. With 15.6% this diocese has one of higher (relative) numbers of worshippers on Sunday in Germany. It comprises the majority of the administrative regions of Upper Franconia and Middle Franconia, as well as a small part of Lower Franconia and the Upper Palatinate. Its seat is Bamberg. The dioceses of Speyer, Eichstätt, and Würzburg are subordinate to it. The Diocese was founded in 1007 out of parts of the dioceses of Eichstätt and Würzburg. In 1817, the diocese was raised to an archdiocese.\n\nOn 1 November 1007, a synod was held in Frankfurt. Eight archbishops and twenty-seven bishops were present at the synod as well as the German King Henry II. Henry II intended to create a new diocese that would aid in the final conquest of paganism in the area around Bamberg. But the territory of the Wends on the upper Main, the Wiesent, and the Aisch had belonged to the Diocese of Würzburg since the organization of the Middle German bishoprics by St. Boniface, so that no new diocese could be erected without the consent of the occupant of that see.\n\nThe bishop of Würzburg raised no objection to parting with some of his territory, especially as the king promised to have Würzburg raised to an archbishopric and to give him an equivalent in Meiningen. The consent of Pope John XVII was obtained for this arrangement, but the elevation of Würzburg to an archbishopric proved impracticable, and its bishop withdrew his consent. \n\nAt the synod, Henry obtained permission for the foundation of the diocese of Bamberg from parts of the dioceses of Würzburg and Eichstätt. Bamberg was made directly subordinate to Rome. It was also decided that Eberhard, the king's chancellor, would be ordained by the archbishop of Mainz, Willigis, to be the head of the new border area diocese. The new diocese had expensive gifts at the synod confirmed by documents, in order to place it on a solid foundation. Henry wanted the celebrated monkish rigour and studiousness of the Hildesheim cathedral chapter – Henry himself was educated there – linked together with the churches under his control, including his favourite diocese of Bamberg. The next seven bishops were named by the emperors, after which free canonical election was the rule. Eberhard's immediate successor, Suidger of Morsleben, became pope in 1046 as Clement II. He was the only pope to be interred north of the Alps in the Bamberg Cathedral. In the thirteenth century, the diocese gradually became a territorial principality, and its bishops took secular precedence next after the archbishops; Bishop Henry I was the first prince-bishop.\n\nThe fortieth bishop, George III of Limburg (1505–22), was inclined toward the Reformation, which caused a violent social outbreak under his successor Weigand (1522–56), and the city suffered severely in the Margraves' War (1552–54), as well as in the Thirty Years' War, when it was placed under the jurisdiction of Bernard, the new Duke of Franconia.\n\nAt the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the bishops recovered their possessions. In 1802, in the course of the German mediatization, the prince-bishopric was secularized and its territory annexed to Bavaria. From 1808 to 1817 the diocese was vacant; but by the Bavarian Concordat of the latter year it was made an archbishopric, with Würzburg, Speyer, and Eichstädt as suffragan sees.\n\n\n"}

Some bemoan the quality of the murals developed through local participation as a model for developing the murals, citing uneven quality, artist Stephen Powers identifies Golden's success in convincing civic authorities that art can be an agent of positive change.\n\nIn 1989, Golden painted a mural in the Point Breeze section of Philadelphia with a group of neighborhood children titled \"Stop the Violence\", in honor of children from that neighborhood that had been killed by gun violence. In 2018, this mural was destroyed when the wall of the rowhome that contained it crumbled during the process of redevelopment, sparking controversy about the effects of gentrification in that neighborhood.\n\n\n\n"}

The Metropolitan Province of \"Cardiff Wales and Herefordshire\" therefore covers all of Wales and part of England. Cardiff's suffragan dioceses are the Diocese of Menevia and the Diocese of Wrexham.\n\nThe origin of the modern diocese can be traced to 1840 when the \"Apostolic Vicariate of the Welsh District\" was created out the \"Western District of England and Wales\". The Welsh District consisted the whole of Wales and the county of Herefordshire. When Pope Pius IX judged that the time was right to re-establish the Catholic hierarchy in Wales and England in 1850. The southern half of the Welsh District became the \"Diocese of Newport and Menevia\" and was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Birmingham. It had its pro-cathedral at Belmont Abbey. In 1895, boundaries were redrawn, and the territory covering Glamorgan, Monmouthshire and Herefordshire was named the \"Diocese of Newport\". Finally, in 1916, without further adjustment of boundaries, the territory was raised to the status of an archdiocese, and given the title \"Archdiocese of Cardiff\". The Episcopal Seat is now located in Cardiff, at St David's Cathedral.\nAs all of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Wales are part of the ecclesiastical province of Cardiff the history of the archdiocese and its suffragan dioceses are intertwined:\n\nThe current ecclesiastical territory of the diocese comprises the local government areas of Cardiff, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, Newport, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Herefordshire. Altogether there are 61 parishes. On 19 April 2011, George Stack was appointed to succeed Peter Smith, who was translated to Southwark in 2010. He was installed as Archbishop on 20 June 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of six deaneries in the Archdiocese of Cardiff, each of which cover several churches in that area, overseen by a dean.\n\nThe deaneries include:\n\n"}

It was the second largest diocese in the Kingdom of Scotland, including Clydesdale, Teviotdale, parts of Tweeddale, Liddesdale, Annandale, Nithsdale, Cunninghame, Kyle, and Strathgryfe, as well as Lennox, Carrick and the part of Galloway known as Desnes.\n\nGlasgow became an archbishopric in 1492, eventually securing the dioceses of Galloway, Argyll and the Isles as suffragans. The Scottish church broke its allegiance to Rome in 1560, but bishops continued intermittently until 1689.\n\nThe diocese of Glasgow became important in the 12th century. It was organized by King David I of Scotland and John, Bishop of Glasgow. There had been an earlier religious site the exact age of which is unknown. According to doubtful hagiographical tradition, this ecclesiastical site had been established by Saint Kentigern. The bishopric became one of the largest and wealthiest in the Kingdom of Scotland, bringing wealth and status to the town. Somewhere between 1175 and 1178 this position was strengthened even further when Bishop Jocelin obtained for the episcopal settlement the status of burgh from King William the Lion, allowing the settlement to expand with the benefits of trading monopolies and other legal guarantees. Sometime between 1189 and 1195 this status was supplemented by an annual fair, which survives to this day as the Glasgow Fair.\n\nUntil 1560, when practice of the Catholic Faith was suppressed by act of the Parliament of Scotland, nearly all the bishops of Glasgow took an active share in the government of the country; whether as chancellors or treasurers of the kingdom or as members of regency during the minority of a sovereign. Robert Wishart (consecrated 1272, d. 1316) was conspicuous for his patriotism during the Scottish War of Independence from England, and was the close friend of William Wallace and Robert Bruce. William Turnbull (consecrated 1447, d. 1454), obtained in 1450 from Pope Nicholas V the charter of foundation for the University of Glasgow.\n\nOn 9 January 1492, Pope Innocent VIII raised the see to metropolitan rank, attaching to it the suffragan dioceses of Argyle, Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Galloway. James Beaton, nephew of the celebrated Cardinal David Beaton, was the fourth and last archbishop of the old hierarchy.\n\nIn 1560, eight years after his nomination, he was forced to retire to France, where he acted as confidential agent of Mary, Queen of Scots, and later openly as ambassador for James VI, till his death in Paris, 25 April 1603. He carried away with him the diocesan records, two of which deserve special mention: (1) \"Registrum Vetus Ecclesiae Cathedralis Glasguensis\", in handwriting of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and (2) \"Liber Ruber Ecclesiae Glasguensis\", with entries from about 1400 to 1476. These, along with other records, were in 1843 printed in a volume for the Maitland Club under the title: \"Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis: Munimenta Ecclesiae Metropolitanae Glasguensis a sede restauratâ saeculo ineunte XII ad reformatam religionem\". A more splendid memorial of those times still remains in the old cathedral of St. Mungo, which was begun by Bishop Jocelyn (consecrated 1175, d. 1199) and received its last additions from Archbishop Blackader (consecr. 1484, d. 1508).\n\nIn 1828, as part of the Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy, the Holy See erected the Western District or Vicariate of Scotland, and the first vicar Apostolic to reside in Glasgow was Andrew Scott, Bishop of Eretria (b. 1772, d, 1846). He was succeeded by John Murdoch, Bishop of Castabala (b. 1796, d. 1865) and John Gray, Bishop of Hypsopolis (b. 1817, d. 1872). On the resignation of Bishop Gray in 1869 Charles Petre Eyre (b. 1817, d. 1902) was consecrated Archbishop of Anazarba and appointed administrator Apostolic. On the Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy by Pope Leo XIII, 4 March 1878, the Archbishopric of Glasgow was re-established, and Archbishop Eyre was transferred to the restored see.\n\n"}

She was also a physician and one of the first ordained female Methodist ministers in the United States.\n\nShaw was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1847. When she was four, she and her family emigrated to the United States and settled in Lawrence, Massachusetts. When Shaw was twelve years old, her father took \"up [a] claim of three hundred and sixty acres of land in the wilderness\" of northern Michigan \"and sent [her] mother and five young children to live there alone.\"\"\nHer mother had envisioned their Michigan home to be “an English farm” with “deep meadows, sunny skies and daisies,\" but was devastated upon their arrival to discover that it was actually a \"forlorn and desolate\" log cabin \"in what was then a wilderness, 40 miles from a post office and 100 miles from a railroad.\" Here the family faced the dangers of living on the frontier. Shaw became very active during this period, helping her siblings refurbish their home and supporting her mother in her time of shock and despair. Shaw took on several physical tasks such as \"digging of a well, chopp[ing] wood for the big fireplace, [and] fell[ing] trees.\"\n\nSeeing her mother's emotional suffering, Shaw blamed her irresponsible father for \"ha[ving] g[iven] no thought to the manner in which [their family was] to make the struggle and survive the hardships [now laid] before [them].\" While her invalid mother was overburdened with household chores\", her father in Lawrence could freely dedicate \"much time to the Abolition cause and big public movements of his day.\"\n\nThe family's misfortunes grew worse over the years. During the Civil War, her sister Eleanor died giving birth, and her brother Tom was wounded. When Shaw was fifteen, she became a school teacher and, after her older brothers and father joined the war effort, she used her earnings to help support her family. Yet with \"every month of [the family's] effort, the gulf between [their] income and [their] expenses grew wider.\"\n\nShaw felt a call to preach from an early age. As a child, she would spend time in the woods near her house, and stand on tree stumps to preach to the forest. She was determined to go to college and follow the path that she felt was God's will for her life. Despite her family's disapproval, as Shaw matured, her drive to attend college became firmer. After the Civil War, she abandoned her teaching job and moved in with her married sister Mary in Big Rapids, Michigan. While she recalls that she would have preferred more physical and active labor, such as digging ditches or shoveling coal, she was forced to pick up the \"dreaded needle,\" and become a seamstress, one of the more acceptable occupations available for women at the time.\n\nA pivotal moment in Shaw's life came when she met Reverend Marianna Thompson, a Universalist minister who came to preach in Grand Rapids. Shaw went to the service, eager to see a woman in the pulpit. After the service, Shaw confided in Thompson her own desire to pursue the ministry as a vocation, and Thompson strongly encouraged her to obtain an education without delay. \n\nThanks to Thompson's help, Shaw entered Big Rapids High School where the preceptress, Lucy Foot, recognized Shaw's talents and drive. At the age of twenty-four, Shaw was invited by Dr. H. C. Peck, a man looking to ordain a woman in the Methodist ministry, to give her first sermon. Shaw hesitated at first because her only previous experience had been \"as a little girl preaching alone in the forest...to a congregation of listening trees.\" With encouragement from Lucy Foot, Dr. Peck, and her close friend, Clara Osborn, Shaw agreed and gave her first sermon in Ashton, Michigan.\n\nDespite the success of her first sermon, her new found passion to preach received disapproval from her classmates, friends, and family who agreed to pay for her college education only if she abandoned preaching. Despite such continual opposition and isolation from so many, Anna chose to keep on preaching. She was \"deeply moved\" by Mary A. Livermore, a prominent lecturer who came to Big Rapids. Ms. Livermore gave her the following advice: “if you want to preach, go on and preach…No matter what people say, don’t let them stop you!”\n\nIn 1873, the Methodist Church “voted unanimously to grant her a local preacher’s license.”\n\nIn 1873, Shaw entered Albion College, a Methodist school in Albion, Michigan. Since her family frowned upon her decided career path, they refused to provide any financial support. At that point, Shaw had been a licensed preacher for three years and earned her wages by giving lectures on temperance.\n\nAfter Albion College, Shaw attended Boston University School of Theology in 1876. She was the only woman in her class of forty-two men, and she always felt \"the abysmal conviction that [she] was not really wanted there.\" This attitude was furthered by her difficulty supporting herself financially. Already running on a tight income, Shaw found it unfair that the \"male licensed preachers were given free accommodations in the dormitory and their board cost each of them $1.25 while it cost her $2 to pay rent of a room outside.\" Additionally, she had trouble finding employment. Unlike in Albion where she was \"practically the only licensed preacher available\", at Boston University there were many preachers who she had to compete with. As she lost money to pay the rent, she struggled to feed herself and felt \"cold, hunger, and lonel[y].\" Now Shaw started to question whether the ministerial profession was meant for her. In the face of these hardships, Shaw continued on. In 1880, after she and Annie Oliver were refused ordination by the Methodist Episcopal Church, despite passing with the top exam score that year, she achieved ordination in the Methodist Protestant Church.\n\nFollowing her ordination, Shaw received an MD from Boston University in 1886. During her time in medical school, she became an outspoken advocate of political rights for women.\n\nBeginning in 1886, Shaw served as the chair of the Franchise Department of Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Her task was \"to work for woman suffrage and then to use the ballot to gain 'home protection' and temperance legislation.\" However her focus on temperance subsided as she became more heavily involved in the suffrage movement by lecturing for the Massachusetts Suffrage Association and later the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA).\n\nShaw first met Susan B. Anthony in 1887. In 1888, Shaw attended the first meeting of the International Council of Women. Susan B. Anthony encouraged her to join the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). Having agreed, Shaw played a key role when the two suffrage associations merged when she \"helped to persuade the AWSA to merge with Anthony's and Elizabeth Cady Stanton's NWSA, creating for the first time in two decades a semblance of organizational unity within the [suffrage] movement.\" Beginning in 1904 and for the next eleven years, Shaw was the president of NAWSA. Under her leadership, NAWSA continued to \"lobby for a national constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote.\"\n\nDuring the early 20th century, Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, NAWSA members, began employing militant techniques (e.g. picketing the White House during World War I) to fight for women's suffrage. They, like other members, were inspired by the success of the militant suffragettes in England. As president of NAWSA, Shaw was pressured to support these tactics. Nevertheless, Shaw maintained that she was \"unalterably opposed to militancy, believing nothing of permanent value has ever been secured by it that could not have been more easily obtained by peaceful methods.\" She remained aligned with Anthony's philosophy that was against any militant tactics. In 1915, she resigned as NAWSA president and was replaced by her ally Carrie Chapman Catt.\n\nDuring World War I, Shaw was head of the Women's Committee of the United States Council of National Defense, for which she became the first woman to earn the Distinguished Service Medal. She continued to lecture for the suffrage cause for the remaining years of her life.\n\nAt an appearance only months before her death at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, Shaw said, \"The only way to refute\" the argument that America was a democracy and therefore women were entitled to vote was \"to prove that women are not people.\" She ended the speech by urging the women in attendance to become involved in the women's suffrage movement.\n\nShe was a speaker at the 1919 National Conference on Lynching, presenting women's suffrage as a step against lynching.\n\nShaw died of pneumonia at her home in Moylan, Pennsylvania at the age of seventy-two, only a few months before Congress ratified the Nineteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nShaw built a home at 240 Ridley Creek Rd., Media, during her tenure as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Assn. (1904–1915) and lived there with her companion Lucy Elmina Anthony (1859–1944), niece of Susan B. Anthony, until her death. Lucy and Anna were together for thirty years, and she was by her bedside when she died.\n\nHer 1915 speech \"The Fundamental Principle of a Republic\" was listed as number 27 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).\n\nIn 2000, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Twenty years later, in 2020, she was named an honoree of the National Women's History Alliance.\n\nThe Anna Howard Shaw Women's Center at Albion College \"coordinates educational programming that promotes inclusiveness and pluralism and raises awareness of women's and gender-related issues. Examples include programming on sexual harassment and sexual assault. The most visible event sponsored by the Center is the Anna Howard Shaw Women's History Month Program, designated each year to honor Dr. Shaw's memory and highlight an important aspect of women's lives. Other educational programs are co-sponsored with student organizations that share mutual interests.\n\n\"The Anna Howard Shaw Center at Boston University School of Theology promotes structures and practices that empower women and honor diversity. The Center is named after the Reverend Doctor Anna Howard Shaw, a Methodist minister, medical doctor, and suffragist. Ten years after its founding in 1978, the Shaw Center was designated as the women's center for the Northeastern Jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church.\"\n\nThe Anna Howard Shaw Junior High School built in 1922–1924 in Southwest Schuylkill, Philadelphia is named for her.\n\nA statue of Anna Howard Shaw was erected next to the Community Library in Big Rapids, Michigan, in 1988.\n\n\n\n"}

The episcopal see is Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The Archdiocese is the centre of the Ecclesiastical Province of Liverpool which covers the north of England as well as the Isle of Man.\n\nWith the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Roman Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century, Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern. Thus Pope Pius IX issued the Bull \"Universalis Ecclesiae\" of 29 September 1850 by which thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses were created.\n\nOne of these was the diocese of Liverpool. Initially it comprised the Hundreds of West Derby, Leyland, Fylde, Amounderness and Lonsdale in Lancashire and the Isle of Man.\n\nIn the early period from 1850 the diocese was a suffragan of the Metropolitan See of Westminster, but a further development was the creation under Pope Pius X on 28 October 1911, of a new Province of Liverpool (also known as the Northern Province).\n\nThe archdiocese covers an area of 1,165 km² (450 sq. mi.) of the west of the County of Lancashire south of the Ribble (West Lancashire and part of South Ribble), parts of Merseyside, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, the historic Hundreds of West Derby and Leyland and the Isle of Man. The see is in the City of Liverpool, where the Archbishop's \"cathedra\" or seat is located in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King, which was dedicated on 14 May 1967.\n\nThe central office building known as the Liverpool Archdiocesan Centre for Evangelisation (LACE). The address is LACE, Croxteth Drive, Liverpool, L17 1AA. The main telephone number is 0151 522 1000.\n\n\"Compiled 3 December 2018\"\n\nCatholic Schools & Colleges\nOn 21 March 2014 Pope Francis appointed Bishop Malcolm McMahon OP as the ninth Archbishop of Liverpool. Bishop McMahon was enthroned as Archbishop of Liverpool on 1 May 2014.\n\nBishop Thomas Anthony Williams was previously appointed Apostolic Administrator during the sede vacante, until the appointment of a new archbishop, following the resignation of Archbishop Patrick Kelly, with effect from 28 February 2013.\n\nThe Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King (usually shortened to Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral) is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Liverpool, England. It replaced the Pro-Cathedral of St. Nicholas, Copperas Hill. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Liverpool, the mother church of Liverpool's Catholics, and the metropolitan church of the Catholic Church's northern province in England.\n\nIn 1853 Bishop Goss awarded the commission for the building of a new Roman Catholic cathedral to Edward Welby Pugin (1833–1875), the son of Augustus Welby Pugin, the joint architect of the Houses of Parliament and champion of the Gothic Revival. By 1856 the Lady Chapel of the new cathedral had been completed on a site adjacent to the Catholic Institute on Saint Domingo Road, Everton. Due to financial restrictions work on the building ceased at this point and the Lady Chapel now named Our Lady Immaculate served as parish church to the local Catholic population until its demolition in the 1980s.\n\nFollowing purchase of the present site at Brownlow Hill in 1930 Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869–1944) was commissioned to provide a design which would be an appropriate response to the Gilbert Scott-designed Neo-gothic Anglican cathedral then emerging at the other end of Hope Street. Lutyens' design would have created a massive classical/Byzantine structure that would have become the second-largest church in the world. It would have had the world's largest dome. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 5 June 1933, but again financial restrictions caused the abandonment of this plan after construction of the crypt.\n\nThe new cathedral, designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd and consecrated in 1967, was built on land adjacent to the crypt. Its circular plan was conceived in direct response to the Second Vatican Council's requirements for a greater and more intimate integration of the congregation with the clergy.\n\nChapels are built in between the buttresses that support the tent-shaped spire (which represents the crown of thorns of Jesus) like tent poles. A short film, Crown of Glass, documents the construction of the cathedral's rainbow-coloured stained glass windows.\n\nThe cathedral stands on the site of the Liverpool Workhouse, on Hope Street. Facing it at the opposite end of Hope Street is the Cathedral Church of Christ, Liverpool's Anglican cathedral. Ironically, Lutyens was an Anglican, while the architect of the Anglican cathedral, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was Catholic.\n\nAnimate Youth Ministries is the youth service for the Archdiocese of Liverpool. The team, based at Lowe House, St Helens, is led by Fr Simon Gore, and consists of a leadership team and a volunteer team all living in community together at Lowe House. Animate Youth Ministries works with school and parish groups on day retreats, mission days and mission weeks, and also holds youth Masses which take place at St Mary's Church, Lowe House, St. Helens. The Liverpool Archdiocesan Youth form an integral part of the annual Liverpool Archdiocesan Lourdes Pilgrimage.\n, the team works with over 9,000 young people each year.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Liverpool has a long tradition of sending priests to work on the missions in Latin America, in particular Peru, This is known as the Liverpool Archdiocesan Missionary Project or colloquially as LAMP. \nIn 2014, there were two priests involved in ministering to disadvantaged communities in Latin America, namely Simon Cadwallader and Dennis Parry.\n\nIn 1923, the first official Archdiocesan pilgrimage set off from Liverpool for Lourdes and continues to the present day, interrupted only by the period of the Second World War. Led by the Archbishop or his Auxiliary, the week-long pilgrimage normally takes place each year between the end of July and beginning of August. During the week ordinary pilgrims from across the Archdiocese meet to participate in services & processions whilst assisted pilgrims are cared for by Liverpool Hospitalité members and helpers from the Archdiocesean Youth Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Godfrey (25 September 1889 - 22 January 1963) was a Roman Catholic bishop, his highest posting was as Archbishop of Westminster. Born in Liverpool, he was educated at Ushaw College and at the Venerable English College, where he was ordained in 1916, during the First World War. He gained his Doctorate the following year. He then taught at Ushaw for 12 years: Classics, Philosophy and Theology. In 1930 he was appointed Rector of the College where during the next eight years he watched Benito Mussolini's rise to power. He was known affectionately to his students despite his strictness as \"Uncle Bill.\" In 1938 he became the first Apostolic Delegate to Great Britain, Gibraltar and Malta and he served in this post with such discretion that in 1953, long after the war, he became Archbishop of Liverpool and in 1956 he was appointed as Archbishop of Westminster. He was created Cardinal two years later. He died in London on 22 January 1963, aged 73.\n\nVincent Gerard Nichols was born in Crosby, Liverpool on 8 November 1945. He entered the Venerable English College (Rome) in 1963 and was ordained priest on 21 December 1969. His further studies include obtaining the Licentiate in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and the degree of Master of Arts from the University of Manchester, specialising in the theology of St John Fisher. After working in the Archdiocese of Liverpool for 14 years, including, latterly, as the Director of the Upholland Northern Institute, Vincent Nichols was appointed General Secretary of the Catholic Episcopal Conference of England & Wales for nine years. In 1992 he was appointed by Pope John Paul II as Titular Bishop of Abora. He served as an auxiliary Bishop in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster between 1992 and 2000, having special pastoral oversight for North London. During this time he served under Basil Hume, Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster. He presided over the burial of Cardinal Hume, at the end of his Requiem Mass in 1999. Nichols was appointed the eleventh Archbishop of Westminster by Pope Benedict XVI on 3 April 2009.[16] The archdiocese, the primatial see of the Church in England and Wales, serves 472,600 Catholics.

In 1653, the whole of Scotland became under the authority the Prefecture Apostolic of Scotland, which in 1694 was elevated to the Vicariate Apostolic of Scotland.\n\nOn 23 July 1727, Scotland was divided into two Vicariates Apostolic, the Lowland District and Highland District. The Lowland District comprised roughly the Scottish Lowlands.\n\nOn 13 February 1827, Scotland was divided again into three Vicariate Apostolics, the Eastern District (formerly the Lowland District), the Northern District (formerly the Highland District), and the Western District (created from territory of the other two districts).\n\nThe Eastern District comprised the sixteen eastern historic counties of Perthshire, Angus, Kincardineshire, Stirlingshire, Clackmannanshire, Kinross, Fife, West Lothian, Mid Lothian, East Lothian, Peebleshire, Selkirkshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, Dumfrieshire, Roxburghshire, and Berwickshire.\n\nFollowing the restoration of the Scottish hierarchy by Pope Leo XIII on 15 March 1878, part of the Eastern District was elevated to the status of an Archdiocese with the title St Andrews & Edinburgh.\n\nIn Lent 2015, Archbishop Cushley outlined his vision for the future of the Archdiocese in a Pastoral Letter entitled \"We Have Found the Messiah\". The document stated aim was to \"respond to the mission entrusted to him [Archbishop Cushley] by Pope Francis: to bring the joy of the Gospel to contemporary society.\" \n\nFollowing the publication of the letter, Archbishop Cushley embarked upon 32 public meetings across the Archdiocese to discuss his vision which includes the possibility of creating larger parish units through either mergers or closures. The process of review is likely to continue until 2017.\n\nThe archdiocese controls the Mount Vernon Cemetery.

Bush, several American politicians sought to either investigate Bush for possible impeachable offenses, or to bring actual impeachment charges on the floor of the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The most significant of these efforts occurred on June 10, 2008, when Congressman Dennis Kucinich, along with co-sponsor Robert Wexler, introduced 35 articles of impeachment against Bush to the U.S. House of Representatives. The House voted 251 to 166 to refer the impeachment resolution to the Judiciary Committee on June 11, where no further action was taken on it. Bush's presidency ended on January 20, 2009, with the completion of his second term in office, rendering impeachment efforts moot.\n\nThe Kucinich–Wexler impeachment resolution contained 35 articles covering the Iraq War, the Valerie Plame affair, creating a case for war with Iran, capture and treatment of prisoners of war, spying and or wiretapping inside the United States, use of signing statements, failing to comply with Congressional subpoenas, the 2004 elections, Medicare, Hurricane Katrina, global warming, and 9/11.\n\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq was the most substantial portion of the articles of impeachment introduced by Kucinich and Wexler. Fifteen of the 35 articles directly relate to alleged misconduct by Bush in seeking authority for the war, and in the conduct of military action itself. Five other articles address allegations partially or tertiarily relating to the war, including the \"outing\" of Valerie Plame, treatment of prisoners (both in Iraq and from operations in Afghanistan and other countries), and building a case for Iran being a threat based in part on alleging Iranian actions in Iraq.\n\nThe first four impeachment articles charge the president with illegally creating a case for war with Iraq, including charges of a propaganda campaign, falsely representing Iraq as responsible for 9/11, and falsely representing Iraq as an imminent danger to the United States.\n\nArticles 5–8 and 12 deal with the invasion of Iraq and include charges that funds were misspent before the war, that the war was in violation of HJRes114, that Iraq was invaded without a war declaration, that the war is a violation of the UN Charter, and that the purpose of the war was to control the country's oil supplies.\n\nArticles 9, 10, 11 and 13 deal with conduct of the war, including failing to provide troops with body armor, falsifying US troop deaths and injuries, establishing a permanent military base in Iraq, and creating a secret task force to develop energy and military policies with respect to Iraq and other countries. Articles 15 and 16 cover contractors in Iraq and charges that the president misspent money on contractors and provided them with immunity.\n\nArticle 14 is about the revelation of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame.\n\nArticles 17–20 concern the treatment of detainees, the \"kidnapping\" and detention of foreign nationals, and the use of torture.\n\nArticle 21 claims that the president misled Congress and the American people about threats from Iran, and supported terrorist organizations within Iran, with the goal of overthrowing the Iranian government.\n\nArticles 24 and 25 charge the president with illegally spying on American citizens, directing US telecom companies to create databases of citizens, and violating the fourth amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nArticle 26 concerns the presidential use of signing statements.\n\nArticle 27 is about failing to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n\nArticles 28 and 29 charge the president with tampering with the 2004 elections and violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nArticle 30 states \"Misleading Congress and the American People in an Attempt to Destroy Medicare.\"\n\nArticle 31 concerns the supposed failure to plan and respond to Hurricane Katrina.\n\nArticle 32 charges the president with \"Systematically Undermining Efforts to Address Global Climate Change.\"\n\nArticles 33, 34 and 35 concern 9/11, alleging that the president failed to respond to prior intelligence, obstructed post-9/11 investigations and endangered the health of 9/11 first responders.\n\nAn early effort to impeach Bush was begun by Lyndon Johnson administration Attorney General Ramsey Clark.\n\nOn June 16, 2005, Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) assembled an unofficial meeting to discuss the Downing Street memo and to consider grounds for impeachment.\nConyers filed a resolution on December 18, 2005, to create an investigative committee to consider impeachment. His resolution gained 38 co-sponsors before it expired at the end of the 109th Congress. He did not reintroduce a similar resolution for the 110th Congress.\n\nKeith Ellison was the leading figure behind the resolution to impeach Bush brought to the Minnesota State House of Representatives in May 2006. Ellison was elected to the United States House of Representatives in November 2006. During the campaign and when he was named to the House Judiciary Committee, Ellison repeatedly called for an investigation into a possible impeachment. In support of his candidacy, he \"received a $1,000 contribution from ImpeachPAC\". Ellison would later note that his \"opinions really have not changed over time, but the circumstances\" regarding his position in Congress had, and he was a \"step before impeachment\".\n\nAt another unofficial hearing convened by Conyers on January 20, 2006, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) called for the committee to explore whether Bush should face impeachment, stemming from his decision to authorize domestic surveillance without court review.\n\nOn May 10, 2006, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) indicated she was not interested in pursuing impeachment and had taken it \"off the table\", reiterating this phrase on November 8, 2006, after the election. In July 2007, Pelosi stated that she \"would probably advocate\" impeaching Bush if she were not in the House nor Speaker of the House.\n\nOn December 8, 2006 (the last day of the 109th Congress), then-Representative Cynthia McKinney (D-GA) submitted a resolution, H. Res. 1106. The bill expired along with the 109th Congress.\n\nJohn Conyers brought up the subject of impeachment on the July 8, 2007, broadcast of \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos,\" stating:\nWe're hoping that as the cries for the removal of both Cheney and Bush now reach 46 percent and 58 percent, respectively, for impeachment, that we could begin to become a little bit more cooperative, if not even amicable, in trying to get to the truth of these matters.\n\nPresidential candidate Dennis Kucinich's major point in the Democratic Presidential Debate on October 30, 2007, was that Bush and Cheney should be impeached for the Iraq War. On November 6, 2007, Kucinich introduced a resolution to impeach Vice President Cheney in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn November 2007, Joe Biden, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, stated that he would move to impeach if President Bush were to bomb Iran without first gaining congressional approval. However, no such bombing occurred during the rest of Bush's term.\n\nOn June 9, 2008, Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), introduced a resolution, , to impeach president George W. Bush, which included 35 counts in the articles of impeachment. At the end of the evening on June 10, Kucinich offered a motion to refer HRes 1258 to the House Judiciary Committee. On June 11, the House voted 251-166 to send the resolution to the Committee.\n\nOn July 14, 2008, Kucinich introduced a new impeachment resolution () limited to a single count.\n\nOn March 21, 2006, the New Mexico Democratic Party, at a convention in Albuquerque, adopted a plank to their platform saying “the Democratic Party of New Mexico supports the impeachment of George Bush and his lawful removal from office.”\n\nOn March 24, 2007, the Vermont Democratic State Committee voted to support JRH 15, a state legislative resolution supporting impeachment, calling for its passage as \"appropriate action.\"\n\nOn January 2, 2008, Betty Hall (D), an 87-year-old, fourteen-term State Representative, introduced New Hampshire House Resolution 24 in the State-Federal Relations and Veterans Affairs Committee of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. The resolution was \"petitioning Congress to commence impeachment procedures\" against Bush and Cheney for \"high crimes and misdemeanors\", including domestic spying, illegal detentions, signing statements, electioneering, the breaking of international treaties, and war crimes. The bill further asserted that \"section 603 of Jefferson's \"Manual of Parliamentary Practice\" states that an impeachment may be set in motion by the United States House of Representatives by charges transmitted from the legislature of a state\".\n\nOn February 20, 2008, the bill was ruled \"Inexpedient to Legislate\" to pass by a 10 to 5 vote within committee, which passed the resolution on to the full House for a vote. The bill was tabled in the New Hampshire House of Representatives on April 16, 2008. After three efforts to have the bill removed from the table were unsuccessful, it died on the table on September 24, 2008.\n\nOn July 25, 2008, Rep. Mike Pence (IN) said that Bush had not broken the law in his own interest. He further cited the Framers of the Constitution and said that we should use \"our own good judgment\" regarding their intent on impeachment.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1864259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864259", "title": "Dot Moore", "text": "Dot Moore\n\nDot Moore (May 15, 1914 - May 23, 2007) was an American TV personality and \"ambassador\" to the stars for 46 years from Mobile, Alabama. Her long broadcasting career spanned four talk show incarnations, numerous trips to the east and west coasts of the United States, and dozens of conversations with television and motion pictures stars. When she died, US Representative Jo Bonner honored her memory; it is entered in the Congressional Record.\n\nShe was born in Pensacola, Florida, and her family moved to Mobile when she was 12. Dorothy \"Dot\" Fillette had her young mind and eyes set on becoming an actress. One indication was her attempt at imitating movies such as those featuring Joan Crawford, whom Dot viewed on days when she voluntarily skipped school. Eventually she concluded that theater didn't have a particular lure, even though she managed to perform on stage locally. Dot's interests to perform before an audience would resurface during her years on television, as it gave her an easy, yet natural feeling. Before fulfilling her lifelong dreams, Moore would finish her schooling at Leinkauf Elementary and Murphy High School before her first job as a secretary close to her father, who was in the steamship business. \n\nShe next worked in the registrar's office at the University of Alabama Expansion Center, sharpening her future interview skills in the process. While at the university, Dot was offered a place in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in downtown Mobile and the U.S. Air Force office at Brookley Field. The investigative position at the Air Force office came shortly after she married Baltimore native Robert Joseph Miller. Her husband died from tuberculosis, leaving Dot and two-year-old year son Bobby behind. \n\nFollowing her husband's death, Dot opened \"Dot's Dress Shoppe\" on Springhill Avenue establishment. There, Dot met the two women who would introduce her to the radio and television business, a radio personality going on vacation and Connie Bea Hope who invited Dot over to her television show. Five years after Bob Miller's death, Dot met her second husband, Lon Stephens Moore of Missouri, when a friend invited him over to her Dauphin Street home. Again, illness would halt Dot's marriage, and the two people Mr. Moore knew very briefly were left alone again. Weeks after a period of mourning, Dot went back to work after finding a job at the same radio station that introduced her to broadcasting, WABB.\n\nMoore was a receptionist at WABB in 1958, a position under the Mobile Register-owned station that would lead to speaking before a wide radio audience with her low tone voice, earning the liking of one WABB announcer. Radio and TV commercials, including a televised March of Dimes public service announcement featuring Moore as a donor would earn her something more than a year after working for WABB and WKAB radio, the daily half-hour program \"Channel 10 Kitchen\" on WALA-TV after the previous chef had to leave for health reasons. Dot, however, was not a cook.\n\nWALA's solution was to find a professional chef and let Moore assist before the viewers. Dot also got the last remark in the program's live commercials sponsored by General Electric. Even after retirement, Dot was not very fond of cooking herself, yet up until the very end of her career, she was still seen speaking to her cooking guests in the studio kitchen. Dot managed to keep her son well nourished on something as easy to prepare as tuna fish casserole, in which Bobby would joke about at times. After the cooking show contract was finished, Dot returned to radio as a commercial copy writer in the WALA radio traffic department. There were also times when the TV side of the building called upon Dot for their commercials or public service spots. She was fired after a dispute with the new radio manager over paperwork that violates broadcasting rules in general. Termination gave Dot time to free-lance in media during the early 1960s.\n\nIn this busy period of trying to stay in Gulf Coast media and keeping things well at home, Dot was contacted by a WALA-TV announcer who wanted her to co-host the station's new program \"Poolside\" from the Admiral Semmes Hotel in downtown Mobile. Dot accepted the job and continued to expand her horizons, creatively and physically. After a successful run of \"Poolside\", Dot returned to free-lancing, including some work for Gayfer's department store and their commercials for Pensacola station WEAR-TV. Just when Dot was getting ready to step out of the public eye after a week of commercials and public appearances in Pensacola, a friend employed at WALA stopped by the Gayfer's store to deliver her some good news. A new afternoon talk show of her very own was set to premiere on the following Monday, with all the guests booked for that week.\n\nOn May 14, 1963, \"Dot Moore & Company\" went the air between noon and 12:30 p.m. The radio manager who had fired Dot was eventually fired shortly after learning of her return from his TV counterpart. Viewers from south Mississippi to the Florida panhandle also got to see Dot help WALA cover Mobile's Mardi Gras Day celebration for 33 years. Ten years after \"Dot Moore & Company\" went on the air, Dot was given an on-air partner named Danny Treanor and the show became known as \"Gulf Coast Today\" in 1973. The 9:00 a.m. program following NBC's \"Today\" continued with this format for the next four years until Dot regained the position of host and producer of the show.\n\nIn September 1979, \"Gulf Coast Today\" began airing once a week before it again bore Dot's name. \"The Dot Moore Show\" would remain on WALA's schedule well into the 21st century.\n\nOver her career, Moore met numerous wealthy and famous people for TV interviews, which was quite easy for journalists and TV personalities during a time before satellite became a common way of conducting interviews. Out of all the people she's met, it was former Pensacola resident and friend Leif Erickson of the NBC western \"The High Chaparral\" who helped keep Dot's relationship with the network's stars alive for years to come. With such a Hollywood connection came a few roles on television, including Erickson's program and the show \"Movin' On\" with Claude Akins, another one of Dot's many guests (\"Movin' On\" was filmed on location once in Mobile and its surrounding areas). Besides people, Dot had an encounter with a Bengal tiger and its trainer, which went through fairly well despite a wet moment that would make Johnny Carson and the monkey he encountered laugh. All good things would come to an end in 1985, when NBC ended Moore's flights to visit the famous and must settle with the network's newly installed satellite technology to keep in touch, but there were exceptions. Art Linkletter and Jock Mahoney were Dot's first celebrated guests three weeks into her show's run. The \"People Are Funny\" emcee and the \"Yancy Derringer\" star happened to be in Mobile the same day. Ed McMahon made a visit to Mobile for the America's Junior Miss national finals in May 1973, plus he made a stop at WALA to appear on Moore's tenth anniversary show on May 14. \"And now, here's Dottie!\" was Ed's introduction for his friend Dot as she was getting ready to go on the air, which came as such a surprise that it never made it into the show's taping. \n\nDuring the 1990s, Moore's Sunday community service program and fourth incarnation had a greater focus on public affairs figures than interviews with the stars. Despite her lessening presence over WALA-TV, which swapped its 43-year affiliation with NBC for Fox in 1996, Dot continued to tell people about her days of traveling outside Mobile. Hundreds of photos featuring her and the people she had met over the years served as a visual aid. Longtime viewers have noticed various changes in Dot's hairstyle and color since appearing on television. During her years under the eyes of sponsors, there were times when they wanted a blonde, brunette, or redheaded lady on the air. Dot would pay for her own hairstyle around 1994. Another surprise Dot had for her viewers were a pair of knee high boots from California, which had the WALA switchboard lit up by those interested in her footwear.\n\n\"The Dot Moore Show\" went on the air for the last time on July 11, 2004, less than a week after Moore had a car accident. According to many Mobile residents, including friend and fellow local media personality Uncle Henry, this accident was the reason for Dot's retirement and move to Montgomery. She died on May 23, 2007, in Montgomery, Alabama.\n"}
{"id": "1864265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864265", "title": "Olde English Bulldogge", "text": "Olde English Bulldogge\n\nThe Olde English Bulldogge is an American dog breed, recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in January 2014. The breed is listed in the UKC Guardian Dog Group. Five years prior to UKC recognition, the breed was registered by the former Canine Developmental, Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR), a privately held business located in Kalamazoo, Missouri. In the early 2000s, CDHPR had been working with the UKC under a unique agreement to develop breeding plans and strategies in an effort to produce improved breeds of dogs that would be accepted as purebred and, therefore, eligible for UKC registration. \n\nIn the early 1970s, dog breeder David Leavitt of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, wanted to \"recreate a with the looks, health and athleticism of the 18th which was originally created for the English sport of bull baiting between the years 1100 to 1835\". In an effort to rapidly achieve his goal for a purebred dog, Leavitt modeled his program after a livestock line breeding scheme developed by Nathan Fechimer, a professor in the Department of Dairy Science, Ohio State University. The foundation breeding for what became the modern Olde English Bulldogge consisted of half English Bulldog, one-sixth Bullmastiff, one-sixth American Pit Bull Terrier and one sixth American Bulldog. The result was an athletic breed that looks similar to the bulldogs of 1820, but with a friendly temperament, fewer health issues, and with longevity reaching into the teens. US researchers have said the Olde English Bulldogge is a \"viable candidate\" as an outcross on which to rebuild the English Bulldog; a breed that genetic studies have suggested is so inbred that it \"cannot be returned to health without an infusion of new bloodlines.\"\n\nThe Olde English Bulldogge was an attempt to recreate the \"Regency Period Bull Baiter\" and was developed in the early 1970s by David Leavitt, of Coatesville, PA. Leavitt began his project in 1971 utilizing the cattle line breeding scheme of Dr. Fechimer from Ohio State University. The goal was to create a dog with the look, health, and athleticism of the original bull-baiting dogs, but with a much less aggressive temperament. The foundation crosses consisted of one-half English Bulldog, one-sixth American Bulldog, one-sixth Bull Mastiff and one-sixth of other breeds. After many planned crosses, the Olde English Bulldogge emerged and began to breed true.\n\nLeavitt formed the Olde English Bulldogge Association (OEBA) to maintain the breed's stud book and issue registration papers to future offspring. During the 1980s, Ben and Karen Campetti from Sandisfield, Massachusetts, worked closely with Leavitt in breeding the Olde English Bulldogge. In 1993, Leavitt stopped breeding and turned the OEBA registry as well as his personal breeding stock over to Working Dog Inc. which was owned and operated by Michael Walz of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2001 the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club (OEBKC) was formed, and in 2005 David Leavitt was involved with merging the Olde English Bulldogge Association's registry with that of the OEBKC's. The Olde English Bulldogge was enrolled with the Canine Developmental Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR) in August 2008 in order to evaluate the breed for recognition within the UKC as a purebred breed of dog. In 2013, the UKC announced that the Olde English Bulldogge would become a fully recognized breed as of January 1, 2014. The OEBKC is currently the recognized Parent Club for the breed with the United Kennel Club (UKC).\n\nIn order to maintain his original breeding aims and to distinguish his line of Olde English Bulldogges from those of other breeders, in 2004 David Leavitt named his line of dogs Leavitt Bulldogs (sometimes spelled \"Bulldogges\"), founding the Leavitt Bulldog Association the following year. The UKC recognizes dogs registered with the Leavitt Bulldog Association as Olde English Bulldogges, along with those registered with the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club and the Olde Bulldogge Club Europe.\n\nThe Olde English Bulldogge is a muscular, medium-sized dog of great strength, and possesser of fluid, agile movement. They are well balanced and proportioned, while appearing capable of performing without any breathing restrictions in either heat or in cold. Serious Faults: Excessive wrinkle, lack of pigment around eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nThe skull is large and well-proportioned to the dog's muscular body and prominent shoulders. There is a defined furrow between the eyes (from the stop to the occiput). Narrow skull and domed forehead are faults. The muzzle is square, wide and deep. \nBite is undershot or reverse scissors. Lower jawbone is moderately curved from front to back.\nNostrils are wide, with a line running vertically between nostrils from the tip of nose down to the bottom of the upper lip. Nose is large and broad in relationship to the width of the muzzle. Nose color is black.\nEyes are medium in size and almond shaped, dark to light brown, with black pigmented eye rims. They are set wide and low, level with the top of the muzzle. Ears are small, rose, button or tulip. Rose is preferred. They are set high, wide and to the back outer edge of the skull. The neck is medium length, wide, and slightly arched. The body is sturdy, powerful and slightly rectangular when viewed from the side. Chest is wide and deep. Hind legs are well muscled and have the appearance of being slightly longer than the forelegs. The hind legs should be straight, parallel and set apart. Accepted color patterns include brindle, and solid colors, with or without white. Males should be 60 to 80 pounds, and 17 to 20 inches at the withers, while females should be 50 to 70 pounds, and 16 to 19 inches at the withers.\n\nThe Olde English Bulldogge may be a healthier breed of dog than many modern Bulldog breeds, though they can be affected by many of the same disorders that occur in any breed. Proponents of the breed maintain that it does not suffer from the same disorders as purebred English bulldogs. A 2016 study published in the journal \"Canine Genetics and Epidemiology\" examined genetic diversity among 102 registered English Bulldogs. The Olde English Bulldogge was mentioned as an outcross candidate to introduce new genetics in an effort to correct some of the problems associated with inbreeding. In the European Union, rules have been written specifically for farm animals which state they have the rights of \"freedom from discomfort\" and \"freedom from pain, injury and disease.\" A 2013 constitutional amendment in Switzerland restates the EU rules in greater detail, and extends such rights to all animals. Many Swiss dog breeders have begun outcrossing English Bulldogs with the Olde English Bulldogge, having created the Continental Bulldog in an effort to bring the English Bulldog into compliance.\n\nMany breeders are now X-raying hips to reduce the incidence of hip dysplasia, as well as having dogs evaluated by organisations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). The Olde English Bulldogge is also quickly becoming well-respected in many working-dog disciplines such as weight pull, therapy training, and obedience. They have become excellent breathers, but still are comparatively sensitive to heat. Artificial insemination is not a standard protocol when breeding Olde English Bulldogges; natural ties are the standard. Breeders from the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club provide educational materials for new breeders, on genetic disorders and the benefits that modern genetic testing for disorders can have on preventing further inheritance of such medical problems in domestic animals. Many breeders are also becoming more aware of how important selective breeding can be to the breed as a whole.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864271", "title": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark", "text": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark (\"Br\" [ˈsʌðɨk]) is a Roman Catholic archdiocese of the Latin Rite in England. The archepiscopal see is headed by the Archbishop of Southwark. The archdiocese is part of the Metropolitan Province of Southwark, which covers the South of England. The cathedral church is St George's Cathedral, Southwark.\n\nThe archdiocese covers the London boroughs south of the Thames, the county of Kent and the Medway Unitary Authority. The diocese is divided into three pastoral areas, each headed by an area bishop, and 20 deaneries, each of which contain a number of parishes:\n\nKent Pastoral Area (Area Bishop: \"presently vacant\"): 50 parishes\n\nSouth East Pastoral Area (Area Bishop: The Right Reverend Patrick Lynch): 66 parishes\n\nSouth West Pastoral Area (Area Bishop: The Right Reverend Paul Hendricks): 64 parishes\n\nSouthwark was one of the dioceses established at the restoration of Catholic hierarchical structures in 1850 by Pope Pius IX. When first erected, the diocese included Berkshire, Hampshire, and the Channel Islands in addition to Surrey, Kent and Sussex. Previous to this these five counties formed part of the London District, which district was governed by a vicar Apostolic, to whom also was committed episcopal jurisdiction over North America and the Bahama Islands. In 1850 London, even at that time a comparatively small city, which, owing to the exigencies of the times, had previously been under the jurisdiction of a single bishop, was now divided between the two new Dioceses of Westminster (north of the Thames) and Southwark (south of the Thames). \n\nThe first bishop of the new diocese of Southwark was the Right Rev. Thomas Grant, D.D., vice-rector of the English College, Rome. He was consecrated On 6 July, 1851. Grant was instrumental in obtaining some Sisters of Mercy from Bermondsey to serve as nurses in the military hospitals during the Crimean War. Grant was succeeded by his vicar-general, James Danell. Robert Coffin, an associate off John Henry Newman and Provincial Superior of the Redemptorists in England and Ireland was appointed bishop in 1882. Former military chaplain John Butt who served as bishop from 1885 to 1897, founded St John's Seminary, Wonersh. Francis Bourne was appointed Bishop of Southwark in 1897 and named Archbishop of Westminster in 1903.\n\nThe areas which now comprise the Diocese of Portsmouth and the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton were subsequently separated. The Ecclesiastical Province of Southwark was erected in 1965 by Pope Paul VI, raising the Diocese to archdiocesan status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Papists Act of 1778 brought a certain limited freedom to those of the faith. Priests no longer moved in fear of imprisonment. Roman Catholics could run their own schools and could once more acquire property. In protest against the act, Lord George Gordon, on 2 June 1780, gathered a large crowd in St George's Fields to march on Westminster. Refused a hearing, they became violent and so began a week of burning, plundering and killing in which many Roman Catholic chapels and houses were destroyed. There is a legend that the high altar of the cathedral stands on the spot where the march began.\n\nIn 1786 there was only one Roman Catholic chapel in the whole of south London, located at Bermondsey. It was then that the Reverend Thomas Walsh, a Douai priest, for £20 a year hired a room in Bandyleg Walk (near where the Southwark fire station now stands). Within two years, the numbers attending the little chapel had increased so rapidly that a new building became necessary. In 1793 a large chapel dedicated to St George was opened in the London Road at a cost of £2,000. It was designed by James Taylor of Weybridge, Surrey. According to tradition it was here that the first High Mass was celebrated in London, outside the chapels of ambassadors, since the time of King James II of England. The occasion was the Solemn Requiem sung for the repose of the soul of Louis XVI of France, who was executed on 21 January 1793.\n\nIt was to St George's that the Reverend Thomas Doyle came in 1820, when the congregation stood at around 7,000. He became the first chaplain in 1829, when the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 removed nearly all the legal disabilities which Catholics had suffered for 250 years. The arrival of Irish immigrants in the area necessitated the construction of a larger house of worship. By 1839 enough money had been collected to make a start and the present site in St George's Fields (then an open space) was purchased for £3,200.\n\nAugustus Pugin, the noted architect of the Gothic Revival, was commissioned to design the church. The foundation stone was laid on 26th May, 1841 in a private ceremony held in the early morning so as not to arouse public unrest. Due to cost constraints, the left tower was never built. The stained glass was by William Wailes of Newcastle. The church was solemnly opened by Bishop Nicholas Wiseman (later Cardinal Wiseman) on 4 July 1848. To mark the occasion, Pope Pius IX sent a golden chalice and paten as a gift. Pugin was the first person to be married in the church on 10 August 1848 to his third wife Jane. \n\nWhen Pope Pius restored the English Roman Catholic hierarchy, St George's was chosen as the cathedral church of the new Roman Catholic Diocese of Southwark, which was to cover the whole of southern England. For the next half-century, until the opening of Westminster Cathedral, St George's was the centre of Roman Catholic life in London. In response to the hostile reaction of many of the British peple to what was popularly characterized as \"papal aggression\", Bishop Nicholas Wiseman wrote \"Appeal to the Reason and Good Feeling of the English people on the subject of the Catholic Hierarchy\", a pamphlet of some thirty pages, addressed to the people themselves rather than to the educated minority who in the writer's view had so grossly and inexcusably misled them. Wiseman followed this with a series of lectures given at St. George's.\n\nIn Thomas Grant was made the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Southwark; Doyle became the provost and administrator and remained so until his death on 6 June 1879. He is buried in the crypt. The new cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Butt on 7 November 1894 and on that day every year the feast of the dedication of the cathedral is celebrated throughout the diocese.\n\nAs of 10 June 2010, there were three auxiliary bishops: Patrick Lynch SS.CC., titular bishop of Castrum; and Paul Hendricks, titular Bishop of Ross and Cromarty; Paul Mason, titular Bishop of Skálaholt. These bishops have particular pastoral responsibility in South East London, South West London and Kent respectively.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Southwark Spirituality Commission identifies resources in the Archdiocese and works to increase awareness and accessibility of them. \n\n\"The Archdiocese of Southwark Universities Chaplaincy Team works in collaboration with universities and their multi-faith chaplaincies in South London, Surrey and Kent. There are Catholic Chaplains at Kings College - Guy's Campus, Goldsmiths, London South Bank, Roehampton and Kingston Universities and at the University of Kent at Canterbury.\" Most of the university chaplaincies work independently providing events for their Catholic community. Throughout the year however, there are times when the Catholic Chaplaincy Team work together to either arrange or take part in events that are open to students and staff from across the different chaplaincies.\n\nThe Southwark archdiocese makes up part of the Catholic Association Pilgrimage.\n\nThe archdiocese is the foundation responsible for over 170 Voluntary Aided and Voluntary Controlled schools in the diocese and is the sponsor of two schools under the English academy programme.\n\n\n"}

Blanchard Sr.\n\nRichard Eugene Blanchard Sr. (Mar. 14, 1925 – April 19, 2004) was a songwriter who was widely known for writing the popular \"Fill My Cup, Lord\" (gospel song).\n\nHe was born in 1925 in Chungking, China, to Methodist missionary parents Ralph and Grace Kipka Blanchard. When the Blanchard family returned home to the United States, Richard grew up as a child and youth in Indiana and North Carolina. Rev. Ralph Blanchard moved from Wolcottville, Indiana, to Tryon, North Carolina, in 1942, bringing his family with him. Blanchard was a senior in high school and graduated from Tryon High School in 1943. During that year, he worked at a Tryon bank, putting his income into war bonds. This financial tactic eventually enabled him to buy lakefront property at Lake Conway, Orange County, Florida, in 1953.\n\nThere were other interests and hobbies that were consistent throughout Blanchard's life: He loved boating and dining by the water. He was an avid traveler, whether conducting tours or driving on his own, in over 75 countries. Blanchard had a fondness for fine art and art museums. He followed sports closely and often attended various spectator-sports events. A believer that a busy mind is a sharp mind, Blanchard enjoyed word games such as Scrabble as well as collecting stamps and coins. Above all, however, Blanchard enjoyed meeting, learning about, and helping people. By 2000, Blanchard's health began a serious decline. He and his wife Anne moved to Swannanoa, North Carolina, to be near their children. He lived there until his death on April 19, 2004.\n\nAfter high school graduation in 1943, Blanchard attended Davidson College for one year and then enlisted in the United States Navy. Receiving a medical discharge, he entered Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947. In 1946 he married the former Anne Carlton of Oxford, Georgia, a graduate of Wesleyan College. They had three children—Richard Jr. (d. 1996), Carol Ann, and Emily (d. 2005). After graduating from Mercer University, Blanchard enrolled in Candler School of Theology at Emory University, also in Georgia, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1949.\n\nBlanchard was ordained a deacon in 1949 and an elder in 1950, after serving two years as pastor of the four-church (\"four-point\") Snellville-Grayson circuit of the North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Church. Transferring to the Florida Conference in 1950, Blanchard completed 40 years in the ministry of the Methodist Church (which became The United Methodist Church on April 23, 1968), serving the following congregations: First Methodist in Orlando as associate pastor; then as senior pastor, Wesley, Coral Gables; First Methodist in Fort Lauderdale; Trinity Methodist in Miami; Palma Ceia in Tampa; First Methodist in Jacksonville; Riviera Beach Methodist; Community Methodist in Holiday; and Conway Methodist in Orlando. Retiring in 1988, Blanchard later renewed his participation in First United Methodist in Orlando and became a member of the Pendergrass Sunday School Class.\n\nDuring the late-1980s, Blanchard wrote a beautiful musical, “Francis of Assisi,” which was produced by Glenn Longacre of Conway for an audience of 600 people. During this period, he was also named “Minister Emeritus” of the Conway Church. In addition to writing numerous gospel songs—many of which were published and recorded—Blanchard also wrote other things. While at Snellville as a young theolog, he wrote a column called \"Between You and Me\" every week for the \"Wesleyan Christian Advocate\", the Methodist paper for North and South Georgia. He also wrote a story called “The Little Star” which was published in \"Ideals\" magazine. Blanchard was selected to write an official biography of Bishop John Branscomb. Blanchard completed “We Remember John” in time for the dedication of the Branscomb Memorial Auditorium in Lakeland, Florida.\n\nCertainly Blanchard's most famous song was \"Fill My Cup, Lord\" (which became a classic). During the 1970s the song was popularized throughout much of the United States by Blanchard's close friend, musician and evangelist Rev. Ray Vaughn.\n\nNote: Most of the content for this Wikipedia entry comes from the obituary entry for Blanchard that appeared on tryondailybulletin.com .

Electricity North West became the licensed Distribution Network Operator for the north west of England as a result. \n\nUnited Utilities operated and maintained the network on behalf of Electricity Northwest until 2010, when Electricity Northwest bought the electricity network operations and maintenance arm of United Utilities to establish one Group.\n\nIn October 2011, United Utilities was selected as the preferred bidder by Severn Trent Water to purchase the Lake Vyrnwy estate for £11 million. United Utilities later withdrew from the bidding process. In February 2012, United Utilities proposed a national water pipeline linking water sources in Manchester to London. In April 2016, United Utilities received an 18-year loan of £500m from The European Investment Bank to support investment across the North West.\n\nIn May 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority granted United Utilities and Severn Trent Water approval to create a new joint venture company in preparation for the water market deregulation. In June 2016, United Utilities and Severn Trent Water formed Water Plus, in readiness to provide the retail services for their non household customers. \n\nAs of 2012 United Utilities owned 184 reservoirs and was responsible to provide and maintain the water supply in the region. Some reservoirs operated by the company are outside the North West such as the Longdendale Chain in Derbyshire, which were constructed by the Manchester Corporation in the 19th century, and remain networked to the North West's water supply.\n\nCumbria\n\nCheshire\n\nDerbyshire\n\nGreater Manchester\n\nLancashire\nIn May 2010, a burst water main cut 15,000 customers in Moreton, Leasowe and Wallasey off water for 3 days.\nIn November 2019, a burst pipe in a local treatment works disrupted water supply in the CH 41/42/43/63 areas and bottled water supply points were set up. \n\nOn 7 August 2015, cryptosporidium, a water borne parasite that can cause diarrhoea and vomiting, had been detected in the water supply to Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble and Wyre affecting more than 300,000 customers. No cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported and by introducing of ultra-violet treatment units \"boil water\" notices could be lifted in some areas. Investigations by UU and the Drinking Water Inspectorate had not identified the cause. \n\nOn 6 September 2015, the water supply was declared free from contamination, and restrictions were lifted. United Utilities was subsequently fined £300,000 at Preston Crown Court on 10 October 2017 for supplying water unfit for human consumption, with an additional £150,000 costs. It paid around £18 million in compensation to its customers.\n\n\n"}

The village is located about south of the city of Haugesund in Western Norway. It sits on the mainland along the Karmsundet strait, directly across the strait from the village of Avaldsnes on the island of Karmøy. The village has a population (2014) of 2738, giving the village a population density of .\n\nVormedal was originally an area consisting mostly of farmland and it has a documented history going back to the early 1500s. Archaeological finds have indicated that the area has been populated for even longer, possibly for as long as 4000 years.\n\nThe area was originally part of the parish (and municipality) of Avaldsnes. It was situated along the old church route that led churchgoers from the areas around the nearby Førresfjorden in the east as they traveled to visit the Avaldsnes Church, after arriving in Vormedal, they had to take a short boat ride across the Karmsundet. Vormedal was also an important location for travelers coming from the village areas more to the south such as Snik, Røyksund, and Fosen as it was the most direct road to Haugesund.\n\nWhen the Førre Church in the village of Førre opened in 1893, some of the traffic going to and from the church stopped, and when the new main road called \"Spannevegen\" opened in the early 1900s, it connected Haugesund with Røyksund, but it ran east of Vormedal, so a lot of the commercial traffic also stopped. In 1965 the municipality of Avaldsnes was merged with the other municipalities on the island of Karmøy to form the new Karmøy municipality. In 1978 the first church on mainland Karmøy was opened, Norheim Church, located in the village of Norheim just north of Vormedal. This new church was the centre of a new parish which also included Vormedal.\n\nToday, Vormedal mostly consists of large residential areas, with one primary and one lower secondary school; three kindergartens as well as a fire station and a small shopping center. Vormedal also has an alginate production facility owned by FMC Health and Nutrition.\n"}

He is predominantly associated with the BBC science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" and its various spin-offs, particularly as the voice of the Daleks and the Cybermen in the 21st century series.\n\nHe is also the executive producer of Big Finish Productions, for which he has produced, directed and written several audio plays, as well as acting in many of them.\n\nSome of Briggs' earliest \"Doctor Who\"-related work was as host of \"The Myth Makers\", a series of made-for-video documentaries produced in the 1980s and 1990s by Reeltime Pictures in which Briggs interviews many of the actors, writers and directors involved in the series. When Reeltime expanded into producing original dramas, Briggs wrote some stories and acted in others, beginning with \"Wartime\", the first unofficial \"Doctor Who\" spin-off, and \"Myth Runner\", a parody of \"Blade Runner\" showcasing bloopers from the \"Myth Makers\" series built around a loose storyline featuring Briggs as a down on his luck private detective in the near future.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Briggs also provided the voice of a future incarnation of the Doctor for a series of unofficial audio dramas by Audio Visuals (a forerunner of Big Finish Productions). This version of the Doctor also appeared in \"Party Animals\", an installment of the \"Doctor Who\" comic published in \"Doctor Who Magazine\" issue 173, cover date 15 May 1991. Briggs also provided the model for the face of the supposed \"Ninth Doctor\" for \"Doctor Who Magazine\" in the late 1990s, when the magazine's comic strip ran a storyline in which the Eighth Doctor apparently regenerated, only for it to later be revealed that the whole thing had been a massive deception (see Shayde and Fey Truscott-Sade).\n\nHe wrote and appeared in several made-for-video dramas by BBV, including the third of the Stranger stories, \"In Memory Alone\" opposite former \"Doctor Who\" stars Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant. (\"In Memory Alone\" would be the last of the Stranger series to have any similarity to \"Doctor Who\", which had inspired it.) He also wrote and appeared in a non-\"Stranger\" BBV production called \"The Airzone Solution\" (1993) and directed a documentary film, \"Stranger than Fiction\" (1994).\n\nBriggs co-wrote a \"Doctor Who\" book called \"The Dalek Survival Guide\" (, published by BBC Books 2002).\n\nHe also voiced the Cyber-Controller and Professor Osborn in the 2002 Webcast audio series Real Time.\n\nSince \"Doctor Who\" returned to television in 2005, Briggs has provided the voices for several monsters, most notably the Daleks and the Cybermen. Briggs also voiced the Nestene Consciousness in the 2005 episode \"Rose\", and recorded a voice for the Jagrafess in the 2005 episode \"The Long Game\". He also provided the voices for the Judoon in both the 2007 and 2008 series as well as the spin-off series \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", and did the voice of the Ice Warrior Skaldak in the 2013 episode \"Cold War\".\n\nOn 9 July 2009, Briggs made his first appearance in the \"Doctor Who\" spin-off \"Torchwood\" in the serial \"\", playing Special Government Advisor Rick Yates.\n\nBriggs has directed many of the Big Finish Productions audio plays, and has provided Dalek, Cybermen, and other alien voices in several of those as well. He has also written and directed the \"Dalek Empire\" and \"Cyberman\" audio plays for Big Finish. In 2006, Briggs took over from Gary Russell (who had been producer of Big Finish since 1999) and became co-executive producer of the company. In 2007, he guest starred in the \"Sapphire and Steel\" audio drama \"Water Like a Stone\".\n\nBriggs voiced the Daleks in a charity theatre production of \"The Daleks' Master Plan\" and briefly appeared on stage playing a regenerated Doctor. Briggs also recorded a short cameo, as the Daleks for the live Dr Who podcast stage show, 50 Years of Doctor Who: Preachrs Podcast Live 2. He appeared in this alongside a mix of modern and classic Doctor Who actors including; Peter Davison, Richard Franklin, Simon Fisher Becker and Terry Molloy.\n\nIn 2010 he starred in \"Doctor Who Live\" as Winston Churchill.\n\nIn 2012, his Doctor Who novel The Dalek Generation was published by Random House/BBC Books.\n\nIn 2013 Briggs portrayed the Dalek voice actor Peter Hawkins in the BBC docudrama \"An Adventure in Space and Time\", which depicted the inception of \"Doctor Who\".

{"id": "1864331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864331", "title": "Water content", "text": "Water content\n\nWater content or moisture content is the quantity of water contained in a material, such as soil (called soil moisture), rock, ceramics, crops, or wood. Water content is used in a wide range of scientific and technical areas, and is expressed as a ratio, which can range from 0 (completely dry) to the value of the materials' porosity at saturation. It can be given on a volumetric or mass (gravimetric) basis.\n\nVolumetric water content, θ, is defined mathematically as:\nwhere formula_2 is the volume of water and formula_3 is equal to the total volume of the wet material, i.e. of the sum of the volume of solid host material (e.g., soil particles, vegetation tissue) formula_4, of water formula_2, and of air formula_6.\n\nGravimetric water content is expressed by mass (weight) as follows:\nwhere formula_8 is the mass of water and formula_9 is the mass of the substance. \n\nFor materials that change in volume with water content, such as coal, the gravimetric water content, \"u\", is expressed in terms of the mass of water per unit mass of the moist specimen (before drying): \nHowever, woodworking, geotechnics and soil science require the gravimetric moisture content to be expressed with respect to the sample's dry weight:\nValues are often expressed as a percentage, i.e. \"u\"×100%.\n\nTo convert gravimetric water content to volumetric water content, multiply the gravimetric water content by the bulk specific gravity formula_12 of the material:\n\nIn soil mechanics and petroleum engineering the water saturation or degree of saturation, formula_14, is defined as\nwhere formula_16 is the porosity, in terms of the volume of void or pore space formula_17 and the total volume of the substance formula_18. Values of \"S\" can range from 0 (dry) to 1 (saturated). In reality, \"S\" never reaches 0 or 1 - these are idealizations for engineering use.\n\nThe normalized water content, formula_19, (also called effective saturation or formula_20) is a dimensionless value defined by van Genuchten as:\nwhere formula_22 is the volumetric water content; formula_23 is the residual water content, defined as the water content for which the gradient formula_24 becomes zero; and, formula_25 is the saturated water content, which is equivalent to porosity, formula_26.\n\nWater content can be directly measured using a drying oven. \n\nGravimetric water content, \"u\", is calculated via the mass of water formula_8:\nwhere formula_29 and formula_30 are the masses of the sample before and after drying in the oven.\nThis gives the numerator of \"u\"; the denominator is either formula_29 or formula_30 (resulting in \"u\"' or \"u\"\", respectively), depending on the discipline.\n\nOn the other hand, volumetric water content, \"θ\", is calculated via the volume of water formula_2:\nwhere formula_35 is the density of water.\nThis gives the numerator of \"θ\"; the denominator, formula_36, is the total volume of the wet material, which is fixed by simply filling up a container of known volume (e.g., a tin can) when taking a sample.\n\nFor wood, the convention is to report moisture content on oven-dry basis (i.e. generally drying sample in an oven set at 105 deg Celsius for 24 hours). In wood drying, this is an important concept.\n\nOther methods that determine water content of a sample include chemical titrations (for example the Karl Fischer titration), determining mass loss on heating (perhaps in the presence of an inert gas), or after freeze drying. In the food industry the Dean-Stark method is also commonly used.\n\nFrom the Annual Book of ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) Standards, the total evaporable moisture content in Aggregate (C 566) can be calculated with the formula: \nwhere formula_38 is the fraction of total evaporable moisture content of sample, formula_39 is the mass of the original sample, and formula_40 is mass of dried sample.\n\nIn addition to the direct and laboratory methods above, the following options are available.\n\nThere are several geophysical methods available that can approximate \"in situ\" soil water content. These methods include: time-domain reflectometry (TDR), neutron probe, frequency domain sensor, capacitance probe, amplitude domain reflectometry, electrical resistivity tomography, ground penetrating radar (GPR), and others that are sensitive to the physical properties of water . Geophysical sensors are often used to monitor soil moisture continuously in agricultural and scientific applications.\n\nSatellite microwave remote sensing is used to estimate soil moisture based on the large contrast between the dielectric properties of wet and dry soil. The microwave radiation is not sensitive to atmospheric variables, and can penetrate through clouds. Also, microwave signal can penetrate, to a certain extent, the vegetation canopy and retrieve information from ground surface. The data from microwave remote sensing satellites such as WindSat, AMSR-E, RADARSAT, ERS-1-2, Metop/ASCAT, and SMAP are used to estimate surface soil moisture.\n\nMoisture may be present as adsorbed moisture at internal surfaces and as capillary condensed water in small pores. At low relative humidities, moisture consists mainly of adsorbed water. At higher relative humidities, liquid water becomes more and more important, depending or not depending on the pore size can also be an influence of volume. In wood-based materials, however, almost all water is adsorbed at humidities below 98% RH.\n\nIn biological applications there can also be a distinction between physisorbed water and \"free\" water — the physisorbed water being that closely associated with and relatively difficult to remove from a biological material. The method used to determine water content may affect whether water present in this form is accounted for. For a better indication of \"free\" and \"bound\" water, the water activity of a material should be considered.\n\nWater molecules may also be present in materials closely associated with individual molecules, as \"water of crystallization\", or as water molecules which are static components of protein structure.\n\nIn soil science, hydrology and agricultural sciences, water content has an important role for groundwater recharge, agriculture, and soil chemistry. Many recent scientific research efforts have aimed toward a predictive-understanding of water content over space and time. Observations have revealed generally that spatial variance in water content tends to increase as overall wetness increases in semiarid regions, to decrease as overall wetness increases in humid regions, and to peak under intermediate wetness conditions in temperate regions .\n\nThere are four standard water contents that are routinely measured and used, which are described in the following table:\n\nAnd lastly the available water content, θ, which is equivalent to:\nwhich can range between 0.1 in gravel and 0.3 in peat.\n\nWhen a soil becomes too dry, plant transpiration drops because the water is increasingly bound to the soil particles by suction. Below the wilting point plants are no longer able to extract water. At this point they wilt and cease transpiring altogether. Conditions where soil is too dry to maintain reliable plant growth is referred to as agricultural drought, and is a particular focus of irrigation management. Such conditions are common in arid and semi-arid environments.\n\nSome agriculture professionals are beginning to use environmental measurements such as soil moisture to schedule irrigation. This method is referred to as \"smart irrigation\" or \"soil cultivation\".\n\nIn saturated groundwater aquifers, all available pore spaces are filled with water (volumetric water content = porosity). Above a capillary fringe, pore spaces have air in them too.\n\nMost soils have a water content less than porosity, which is the definition of unsaturated conditions, and they make up the subject of vadose zone hydrogeology. The capillary fringe of the water table is the dividing line between saturated and unsaturated conditions. Water content in the capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance above the phreatic surface. The flow of water through and unsaturated zone in soils often involves a process of fingering, resulting from Saffman–Taylor instability. This results mostly through drainage processes and produces and unstable interface between saturated and unsaturated regions. \n\nOne of the main complications which arises in studying the vadose zone, is the fact that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a function of the water content of the material. As a material dries out, the connected wet pathways through the media become smaller, the hydraulic conductivity decreasing with lower water content in a very non-linear fashion. \n\nA water retention curve is the relationship between volumetric water content and the water potential of the porous medium. It is characteristic for different types of porous medium. Due to hysteresis, different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.\n\nGenerally, an aggregate has four different moisture conditions. They are Oven-dry (OD), Air-dry (AD), Saturated surface dry (SSD) and damp (or wet). Oven-dry and Saturated surface dry can be achieved by experiments in laboratories, while Air-dry and damp (or wet) are aggregates' common conditions in nature.\n\n\n\n\nThe water adsorption by mass (A) is defined in terms of the mass of saturated-surface-dry (M) sample and the mass of oven dried test sample (M) by the formula:\n\n\nAmong these four moisture condition of aggregates, saturated surface dry is the condition that has the most applications in laboratory experiments, researches and studies, especially these related to water absorption, composition ratio or shrinkage test in materials like concrete. For many related experiments, a saturated surface dry condition is a premise that must be realize before the experiment. In saturated surface dry condition, the aggregate's water content is in a relatively stable and static situation where it would not be affected by its environment. Therefore, in experiments and tests where aggregates are in saturated surface dry condition, there would be fewer disrupting factors than in other three conditions.\n\n"}

They were assembled and produced by Full Force, of which Moseley and Hughes were also members.\n\nLisa Lisa and Cult Jam was formed after Velez auditioned with Full Force, a production team from East Flatbush, Brooklyn, at the age of 14. The group released their debut album \"Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force\" in 1985. She was signed by Columbia Records and the label released their single \"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" to the European division of CBS Records in 1983 for the compilation album \"Breakdancing\". Stateside club DJs began playing the single from the import LP during 1984, and thus the U.S. division of CBS, Columbia Records, released the record. It quickly became a chart-topper on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Dance/Disco chart. It then crossed over to the R&B chart where it peaked at #6, and then to the pop chart, peaking at #34 in summer 1985. The single eventually went gold.\n\n\"I Wonder If I Take You Home\" was followed by another club hit, \"Can You Feel the Beat,\" which also went to #40 on the R&B chart in late 1985. A sampling of the lyrics of this song would later be used by Nina Sky for their hit single \"Move Ya Body\" in 2004. Their third single, the ballad \"All Cried Out,\" also went gold, going to number #3 R&B and #8 pop in summer 1986. \"All Cried Out\" was later covered by Allure in 1997 and was a hit in 1998. \"Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam with Full Force\" went platinum.\n\nTheir second album, \"Spanish Fly\", was a huge success in 1987. It spawned two #1 pop hits, \"Head to Toe\" and \"Lost in Emotion,\" both of which went gold and sported a retro Motown flavor mixed with the freestyle sound the group was known for. \"Head to Toe\" also parked at #1 R&B for two weeks and stayed in the pop top 5 nearly three months, while \"Lost in Emotion's\" video became the fourth most played of 1987 on MTV. \"Spanish Fly\" went platinum, peaking at #7 on the album chart. Other singles from the album were the ballad \"Someone to Love Me for Me\" (#7 R&B), and \"Everything Will B-Fine\" (#9 R&B).\n\nIn between albums they recorded \"Go for Yours,\" which was featured in the movie \"Caddyshack II\".\n\nTheir third album was titled \"Straight to the Sky,\" and was released in 1989. It featured the single \"Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star.\"\n\nTheir fourth and final album, \"Straight Outta Hell's Kitchen\", was less of a success, though it did include a hit with \"Let the Beat Hit 'Em,\" which was a #1 hit on both the R&B and club charts.

Her campaign was widely seen as part of a broader movement to set the Labour Congress back on a more strategic, inclusive member focused path.\n\nShe first became involved in labour politics during the seventeen years she spent working for the \"Toronto Star\", holding various positions in its ranks, where she became involved as an activist in the Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild (SONG). Starting out as a shop steward, she became the union's representative on various labour bodies. In 1995, she became a representative for the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada.\n\nHer strong interests in equality issues led to her being hired in 2000 as union's first director of human rights, and she participated on their behalf in the World Conference against Racism held in Durban, South Africa in 2001. In 2002, she was elected vice president of the Canadian Labour Congress representing workers of colour. She has also worked as a national negotiator for the Public Service Alliance of Canada, negotiating contracts in the public and private sectors from coast to coast to coast.\n\nWall was a member of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and has served on the Women's Committee of the Ontario Federation of Labour and the CLC's Human Rights Committee. She has also served as a member of several boards including the Pay Equity Advocacy and Legal Services Clinic, York University's Centre for Research on Work and Society and the Chiropractic College of Ontario. As well, she co-chaired the 1998 Commonwealth Study Conference, and is co-author of a book on popular education entitled \"Education for Changing Unions\".\n\nCarol and her partner Gerry have three grown children and are proud grandparents of four grandsons and a granddaughter. Born and raised in Toronto, Carol now lives in Warkworth, east of Toronto.
