{"id": "1834192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834192", "title": "Rodgau", "text": "Rodgau\n\nRodgau is a town in the Offenbach district in the \"Regierungsbezirk\" of Darmstadt in Hesse, Germany. It lies southeast of Frankfurt am Main in the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and has the greatest population of any municipality in the Offenbach district. It came into being in 1979 when the greater community of Rodgau was raised to town, after having been formed through a merger of five formerly self-administering communities in the framework of municipal reform in Hesse in 1977. The current constituent communities’ history reaches back to the 8th century.\n\nRodgau is part of the metropolitan area known as the Rhein-Main-Gebiet in German, one of Germany's economically strongest areas. The fiftieth parallel of north latitude (50°N) passes right through Puiseaux-Platz (square) in Nieder-Roden.\n\nThe town lies on the so-called \"Untermainebene\", or Lower Main Plain, the northern outlying part of the Rhine rift. The flat land around Rodgau is set against hillier country in the nearby Spessart, Taunus, Vogelsberg, Odenwald and Bergstraße, which all serve as recreational areas for the people. The state boundary with neighbouring Bavaria runs only a few kilometres away, at the Main.\n\nAbout a third of the municipal area is made up of woodland, and another third of land under agricultural use and of open water, while the remaining third is built up with residential and commercial areas and transport facilities. The brook, the Rodau, runs for 15 km through the whole municipal area.\n\nClimatically the area is among Germany's mildest and least rainy areas (mean yearly measurements for 1982-2004: 10.5 °C, 639.1 mm).\n\nRodgau borders in the north on the towns of Heusenstamm and Obertshausen, in the east on the community of Hainburg and the town of Seligenstadt, in the southeast on the town of Babenhausen and the community of Eppertshausen (both in Darmstadt-Dieburg), in the southwest on the town of Rödermark and in the west on the town of Dietzenbach.\n\nRodgau's \"Stadtteile\" are Weiskirchen, Hainhausen, Jügesheim, Dudenhofen and Nieder-Roden with its own \"Ortsteil\" of Rollwald.\n\nOn 1 January 1977, in the course of municipal reform in Hesse, the greater community of Rodgau came into being as the communities of Weiskirchen, Hainhausen, Jügesheim, Dudenhofen and Nieder-Roden, along with the settlement of Rollwald belonging to Nieder-Roden were amalgamated. The greater community was granted town rights on 15 September 1979. The old cropfield name \"Rodgau\", like \"Bachgau\" and \"Kinziggau\" belonging to the \"Maingau\", gave the town its name. The original communities, though, have existed for hundreds of years.\n\nToday (as at 31 December 2007), Rodgau has 45,236 inhabitants (including 2,035 whose main residence is elsewhere), of whom 22,120 are male and 23,116 female. Foreigners from 52 different nations account for 4,471 inhabitants (9.9%). Those who have lived in Rodgau longer than ten years account for 64.6% of the population.\n\nAround Saint Peter's Church (\"Peterskirche\") arose the settlement of \"Wichenkirchen\" (or \"Wizzinkirchin\") in Frankish times as a thorpe (one-street village). It had its first documentary mention in 1287 in the Seligenstadt Monastery's accord with the Auheimer Mark. Weiskirchen was at this time Mother Church to the villages of Jügesheim, Hainhausen and Rembrücken. The first landlords, the Lords of Hagenhausen – later of Eppstein – sold the \"Amt\" of Steinheim in 1425 along with Weiskirchen, a village belonging to it, to the Archbishop and Elector of Mainz, to whom the village belonged until 1803. With this, Weiskirchen formed an ecclesiastical and economic hub in the Rodgau. When the Auheimer Mark (a communally held parcel of land to which belonged several villages) was divided up in 1786, Weiskirchen received a share of the forest.\n\nAfter Secularization in 1803, the \"Amt\" of Steinheim along with Weiskirchen passed to Hesse. In 1896 the \"Rodgaubahn\" (railway) with a railway station in Weiskirchen opened.\n\nIn the course of the 19th century, Weiskirchen shifted from a farming village to a worker's community. Of the once well known village with its timber-frame houses very little is left. During National Socialist times, the small Jewish community was driven out. In March 2005, the small, restored former synagogue was ceremoniously reopened as a memorial. Since 1967, the Weiskirchen transmitter, a medium-wave transmitter owned by Hessischer Rundfunk, has been in operation on Weiskirchen's northwestern outskirts on a frequency of 594 kHz although this has now been dismantled.\n\nIn 1576, Weiskirchen had 37 households. In 1681, 111 inhabitants lived in 26 households. In 1834, 655 people lived in the village. A century later, in 1939, that figure had risen to 1,740. By 1970, the population had risen to 4,840 inhabitants. In late 2007, the constituent community had 6,115 inhabitants.\n\nAs early as 1108, Rodgau's smallest constituent community (with a population today of roughly 3,800) had a documentary mention as the location of a moated castle belonging to the Lords of Hagenhausen, in which it was named as \"Haginhusen\". Remains of this castle still lie under a meadow near the Rodau on today's Burgstraße (road). The Hagenhausen noble family, who after moving to the Taunus began styling themselves the Lords of Eppstein, and writing many a page in mediaeval German history, found themselves holding great importance and power from the 13th century onwards. Four Archbishops of Mainz alone were installed by the Eppsteins. Hainhausen, though, did not benefit from the former lords’ descendants’ lordliness. In 1425, the Lords of Eppstein sold the \"Amt\" of Steinheim along with Hainhausen to the Archbishop and Elector of Mainz. Its low point came, as it did for all the surrounding villages too, in the Thirty Years' War, at which time the Plague also raged among the population. The survivors besought the patron saint of Plague sufferers, Saint Roch for help. The end of the deadly epidemic is still celebrated today every year on 16 August with a procession, whose destination was originally the Rochus-Kapelle (“Saint Roch’s Chapel”), consecrated in 1692. Nowadays, though, the newer Rochus-Kirche (“Saint Roch’s Church”), standing at a different site in the heart of the community, serves as the procession's endpoint, and has since the late 19th century. Saint Roch's Church houses as an art history treasure a pietà from the mid 14th century which depicts in sculpture Mary and Jesus after he has been taken down from the Cross. After Secularization in 1803, Hainhausen passed to Hesse.\n\nIn 1681, 101 inhabitants lived in 18 households. In 1834, there were 341 inhabitants in Hainhausen. In 1939, this had risen to 835 inhabitants. In 1970, Hainhausen had 2,051 inhabitants. In late 2007 the constituent community had 3,820 inhabitants.\n\nFounded as a clump village, today's constituent community had its first documentary mention in 1261 under the name \"Guginsheim\". One of Charlemagne’s \"Vögte\" (singular: \"Vogt\") named Gugin or Guginhart was supposedly the namesake. Other forms of the name used over the course of the Middle Ages were \"Gugesheym\", \"Gogeßheym\", \"Goginsheym\", and \"Gugesheim\". In the local speech, Jügesheim is sometimes still called \"Giesem\" today. Jügesheim was founded in Frankish times, or more particularly in Merovingian times (between 481 and 560). Near the old Roman roads in the Maingau woods, which crossed near Jügesheim, the Franks built new military colonies to control the land.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the surrounding woodlands belonged to the Wildbann Dreieich, a royal hunting forest, one of whose 30 \"Wildhuben\" (special estates whose owners were charged with guarding the hunting forest) was maintained in Jügesheim. In 1425, the Lords of Eppstein sold the \"Amt\" of Steinheim along with Jügesheim to the Archbishop and Elector of Mainz.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War took a heavy toll on the community, which at that time was part of the Rödermark (communal lands). The place only recovered in the 17th century. In the 20th century it established a leather industry with many workers working leather at home. Besides this there were of course many farming households. After Secularization in 1803, Jügesheim passed to Hesse. In 1896 the \"Rodgaubahn\" (railway) with a railway station in Jügesheim opened.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, a commercial area was laid out, which over the years that followed further grew. The new Town Hall made Jügesheim into a centre of Rodgau. Today Rodgau's second biggest constituent community has some 11,700 inhabitants.\n\nNorth of the constituent community between Hainhausen and Jügesheim is found the 43.5 m-tall watertower built in the years from 1936 to 1938. It was in use until 1979, and is now under monumental protection. It has become a kind of landmark for Jügesheim, and indeed for all Rodgau.\n\nIn 1576 Jügesheim had 36 households. In 1681, 121 persons lived in only 26 households. In 1834, the village had 1,071 inhabitants. In the 20th century this rose to 3,174 in 1939, and to 7,673 in 1970. In late 2007 the constituent community had 11,855 inhabitants.\n\nDudenhofen was founded in the second wave of Frankish settlement, after the time of the partition of the empire in 561. The place was founded at a newly built road junction in an expanded road network, at the expense of the former hub at Jügesheim. The placename relates to a personal name \"Tuoto\" or \"Dodo\".\n\nDudenhofen had its first documentary mention in 1278 in an accord from Archbishop Werner von Eppstein of Mainz with the Lords of Eppstein. The village long belonged to various owners at the same time (the Lords of Falkenstein, Hanau, Isenburg and Electoral Mainz), the odd part was bequeathed, others were traded or mortgaged (complete with inhabitants). Between 1450 and 1736, Dudenhofen belonged to the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg and was assigned to the \"Amt\" of Babenhausen, thereby making the place as of 1550 an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. The Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg died out in 1736, whereupon Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Kassel found themselves at odds over the village. In 1771, Dudenhofen was annexed by the County of Hesse-Kassel. Above the main entrance to the Baroque Evangelical church is therefore found Hesse-Kassel's coat of arms. Underneath the arms is the inscription \"Was unter Hessens Lust Erbprinz Wilhelm gebaut, sei Dir, o wahrer Gott, zur Pflege nun vertraut\" (“That built under Hesse’s desire Hereditary Prince William, be it trusted unto Thee, O true God, for its care”). Meant here is William IX.\n\nIn 1807, the \"Amt\" of Babenhausen along with Dudenhofen passed to French administration. In 1811, Dudenhofen was absorbed into the Grand Duchy of Hesse. In 1896 the \"Rodgaubahn\" (railway) with a railway station in Dudenhofen opened.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, many young men emigrated to the Americas to seek their fortune. Today, agriculture, except for asparagus growing, plays no further rôle.\n\nIn the Thirty Years' War, the village's population suffered great losses. In 1622 alone, 155 of the 430 inhabitants lost their lives. In 1631 the Plague claimed 104 victims. Only 26 inhabitants lived to see the war end.\n\nIn 1681, Dudenhofen had 38 households and 139 inhabitants. In 1834 there were 1,139 people in the village, almost all Evangelical but for one long established Jewish family, the Reinhardt family, that was driven out of the village in 1938 shortly after Kristallnacht. In 1939 there were 2,120 inhabitants and in 1970, 4,628. In late 2007 the constituent community had 7,967 inhabitants.\n\nThe centre that is now Rodgau's biggest constituent community had its first documentary mention as early as 786 when the \"Rotaha\" Monastery was bequeathed to the Lorsch Abbey. The name might go back to the \"Siedlung auf einer gerodeten Aue\" (“Settlement on a cleared floodplain”), but it is also likely that it comes from the Rodau, which runs through the community, and which rises in Rotliegend near Urberach. During floods, it was once known to run red (\"rot\" in German). Whereabouts the monastery lay is to this day unknown. Finds, however, confirm that people were settling in what is now Nieder-Roden long before the Christian Era. In the Middle Ages, the surrounding woodlands belonged to the Wildbann Dreieich, a royal hunting forest, one of whose 30 \"Wildhuben\" (special estates whose owners were charged with guarding the hunting forest) was maintained in Nieder-Roden.\n\nNieder-Roden had another documentary mention in 791 when the Frankish nobleman Erlulf donated all his holdings in Nieder-Roden (\"rotahen inferiore\"), Ober-Roden (\"rotahen superiore\") and Bieber to the Lorsch Abbey. In 1346 the village became an independent parish, although in the years that followed it still remained in a certain dependency relationship with its former mother parish of Ober-Roden.\n\nFormerly an Eppstein holding, the place belonged from 1425 to 1803 to the Archbishopric of Mainz and enjoyed great importance as the centre of a tithing area and the seat of a tithe court. In 1803, the village, as part of the \"Amtsvogtei\" of Dieburg, ended up with the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, the later Grand Duchy of Hesse. When the Rödermark (a communally held parcel of land to which belonged several villages) was divided up in 1818, Nieder-Roden received a share of the forest. In 1832, Nieder-Roden passed to the Offenbach district. From 1874 to 1977, the community was in the Dieburg district. In 1896 the \"Rodgaubahn\" (railway) with a railway station in Nieder-Roden opened.\n\nIn the Second World War, during the National Socialist régime, there arose a penal and prison camp, the \"Lager Rollwald\" (“Rollwald Camp”) on the land now occupied by the Rollwald community.\n\nAfter the war, Nieder-Roden grew, especially in the 1960s and 1970s from 2,500 inhabitants to now almost 16,000. In the course of district reform in Hesse in 1977, the community was transferred from the Dieburg district to the Offenbach district, to which the town of Rodgau also belongs.\n\nIn 1576 there were 66 households. In 1681, 117 people lived in only 29 households. In 1829 Nieder-Roden had 787 inhabitants. In 1939, this had risen to 3,616 and by 1970 the number had reached 11,033. In late 2007 the constituent community had 15,479 inhabitants.\n\nTown council, as the highest political body in Rodgau, is elected every five years by eligible citizens. The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results: CDU 47.7%, SPD 31.1%, GRÜNE 9.9%, Bürger/FWG 4.2%, FDP 3.9%, Deutsche Liste 3.2%.\n\nThis has further yielded the following seat apportionment: CDU = 22, SPD = 14, Grüne = 4, Bürger/FWG = 2, FDP = 2, Deutsche Liste = 1. The CDU and FDP work together and between them have a three-vote majority in local government. These two parties are also the ones from which the two full-time members of the town executive come. These are each elected for six-year terms.\n\nIn late November 2006, three members from the CDU faction were excluded and since then have formed a further faction, styling themselves the CSG (\"Christlich Soziale Gruppe\"). This altered the seat apportionment and therefore the majority relationship as follows: CDU = 19, CSG = 3, SPD = 14, Grüne = 4, Bürger/FWG = 2, FDP = 2, Deutsche Liste = 1.\n\nTown council furthermore chooses eight of its members to sit on the town executive (\"Magistrat\"), two full-time and the other six part-time. The mayor, who is directly elected by the citizenry every six years, chairs the executive.\n\nThe five constituent communities’ concerns are handled through local councils in each one. These, however, have only an advisory function at town council, and seats are apportioned according to election results in each constituent community.\n\nPolitical bodies sit in the session chamber at Town Hall, which was completed in 1988 and stands in the constituent community of Jügesheim.\n\nThe town's arms can be blazoned thus: \"Party per bend sinister azure a rose argent surmounted by a heart gules, itself surmounted by a Latin cross sable, gules a wheel spoked of six of the second, surmounting the parting a bend sinister wavy of the second, itself surmounted by five mullets of five of the fourth.\"\n\nIn 1978, the then greater community of Rodgau was granted a coat of arms. The German blazon reads: \"Das Wappen zeigt in Blau und in Rot einen gewellten silbernen Schräglingsbalken, belegt mit fünf Sternen, begleitet oben rechts von einer silbernen Rose mit silbernen Kelchblättern, diese belegt mit einem roten Herzen, dem ein schwarzes Kreuz aufliegt (Lutherrose), unten links von einem sechsspeichigen silbernen Mainzer Rad.\"\n\nThe escutcheon is divided in half by a wavy bend beginning at the upper sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side. This symbolizes the Rodau, which runs through the whole municipal area. The five mullets (stars) stand for the five constituent communities. On the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side stands the “Luther rose” as a charge. This recalls Dudenhofen's time as an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. On the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is the Wheel of Mainz, borrowed from the arms borne by the Archbishops of Mainz. This recalls the time when Electoral Mainz succeeded the Lords of Eppstein in all constituent communities in 1425. Mainz's overlordship lasted in most constituent communities until Secularization in the early 19th century, but in Dudenhofen ended as early as the 17th century.\n\nUntil 1977, each constituent community had its own coat of arms as a self-administering community.\n\n (Granted in 1958) The four waterwheels refer to the mills that were once found in Weiskirchen, and the white churchtower is canting, referring to the community's name, from the German for “white church”.\n\n (Granted in 1954) The arms show a stylized image of the former moated castle that once stood on the Rodau's right bank south of the road that leads to Weiskirchen, and that was once the family seat of the Lords of Hainhausen, who were first mentioned in 1122. Out of this family grew the Eppstein dynasty, whose arms with three chevronnets are included here in an inescutcheon. The tinctures silver and red refer to the arms borne by the Archbishops of Mainz, into whose ownership the village was sold in 1425.\n\n (Granted in 1955) The charges in these arms, both the oak sprig and the pair of hart's horns, were chosen to recall the days when Jügesheim was part of the \"Wildbann\" (royal hunting forest). The silver and red here likewise refer to the Wheel of Mainz arms borne by the Archbishops of Mainz.\n\n (Granted in 1954) The three chevronnets recall the community's former allegiance to the County of Hanau. Below these is the Luther rose, which recalls Dudenhofen's time as an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. This charge is now also in the town's arms.\n\n (Granted in 1949) The churchtower shown in these arms is the one found at the local church, and is interesting from an art-history point of view. It is flanked in the arms by two inescutcheons, the chevronnets borne by the Lords of Eppstein on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, and the Wheel of Mainz borne by the Archbishops of Mainz on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side. These stand for former feudal overlords.\n\n\nOn 25 May 1974, the mayors Hans Elgner (Nieder-Roden), Georges Bordry (Puiseaux) and Hubert Rein (Hainburg an der Donau) signed the partnership documents at the Nieder-Roden community centre.\n\nMuch as agriculture may have defined life in the formerly self-administering communities until the early 19th century, this changed with creeping industrialization, above all that in Offenbach. Most farmers took work in the nearby cities of Offenbach and Frankfurt and thereafter ran their farms only as a sideline.\n\nIn the mid 20th century, many small and midsize businesses in the leatherworking industry set up shop in the Rodgau's communities. Its products – handbags, suitcases, belts, wallets and purses – were made mostly in private homes as a kind of cottage industry. By 1975, this had led to the almost complete disappearance of the farming sideline. In 2004, only eleven farms were still being worked as main income earners, mostly to grow asparagus, and four were still being worked as a sideline.\n\nBesides leatherworking, metalworking also locally became a field of endeavour at roughly the same time to supply belt buckles, suitcase handles and suchlike. Major works were located in Weiskirchen, Jügesheim and Nieder-Roden. Nowadays, though, leatherware manufacturing and metalworking play only a subordinate rôle.\n\nIn 1954, a new field of industry for this region established itself on Dudenhofen's outskirts, the Dudenhofen Sand Lime Works (\"Kalksandsteinwerk Dudenhofen\"), which quarried the fine dune sand available there for making up to 73 million bricks in one year. In the 1990s the company shifted its production focus to manufacturing porous concrete presicion blocks (\"Plansteine\"), today known under the name \"Porit\".\nIn the early 1960s, Adam Opel AG chose Dudenhofen as the location for their test centre, which came into service in 1966. In the middle of a 4.8 km-long high-speed loop track are found a crash-test facility and a 6.7 km-long test track with all conceivable road types for longterm tests.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Rodgau opened up six major industrial parks with a combined area of 219 ha in which settled mainly service businesses such as the IBM product distribution centre (until 2005, thereafter Mann-Mobilia logistics centre), the firm Atlas Rhein Main, the FEGRO wholesale market, MEWA Textilservice, GEODIS, Pepsi-Cola Deutschland, PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences and a DHL postal freight centre. All together, in mid-2005, there were reported to be 3,871 businesses in Rodgau, among them 23 supermarkets from the best known chains and 16 hotels with 795 beds.\n\nThe trend of shifting from producing industries and crafts to service industries became clear when 2003 is compared to 1987: ten years after the greater community was founded, service industries comprised 52% of the economy, but this share rose over the next 15 years to 73%.\n\nIn Rodgau, roughly 150 high technology companies are resident. Dominating the technological field is information and communications technology for aviation and space travel, followed by sensor, measuring, control and analytical technology. Furthermore, production technology, automatic surface finishing, microelectronics and optoelectronics are also represented.\n\nIn 2005, Rodgau's commercial operations made available all together 9,076 jobs on the social insurance rolls. Moreover, there were roughly 3,000 jobs for the self-employed, officials and those marginally employed.\n\nA great number of Rodgau's working people have jobs in the nearby cities: Frankfurt am Main (25 km away), Frankfurt Airport (30 km away), Offenbach am Main (15 km away), Hanau (15 km away), Darmstadt (20 km away) and Aschaffenburg (20 km away).\n\nSince 14 December 2003, all Rodgau's constituent communities have been linked to the broad network of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn by the extension of line S1 from Wiesbaden to Ober-Roden. Until that time, Rodgau had been served by the \"Rodgaubahn\" (railway).\n\nThere is regular bus service to the railway stations at Nieder-Roden and Jügesheim on the S1 through district buslines to Babenhausen, Seligenstadt, Dietzenbach and Langen and town buslines to Hainhausen, Weiskirchen and Rollwald.\n\nThe town of Rodgau is slowly finding at its disposal a network of cycle paths which are being laid out in collaboration with the \"Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club\" (“General German Bicycle Club”, ADFC), and which link all five constituent communities together. Since 2005, the signposted \"Rodgau-Rundweg\" has run through fields and woods right round the town. At 42.1 km in length it runs to almost marathon distance. On both sides of the S-Bahn line, a 14 km-long, asphalt-paved cycle path from Rollwald to Weiskirchen links all constituent communities. Special bicycle parking places with stands and lockable rental boxes are to be found at every S-Bahn station.\n\nPedestrian precincts have been laid out in Nieder-Roden between the S-Bahn station and Puiseauxplatz (square) and in Jügesheim on Rodgau-Passage. Areas with much reduced traffic with their attendant paving can be found in all constituent communities, mostly in the old community cores and in new development areas. Walking paths through the Rodau-Aue in Dudenhofen and Jügesheim, partly laid out like a park, are reserved for pedestrians. An extensive network of signposted hiking trails threads its way through fields and woods in Rodgau's municipal area.\n\nIn Rodgau's north, the A 3 (Frankfurt-Würzburg) runs through the municipal area and crosses \"Bundesstraße\" 45 (Hanau-Dieburg), which has been expanded to expresswaylike proportions, and which runs north-south, touching all constituent communities, and has four interchanges. The Weiskirchen service centre within Rodgau town limits on the A 3 can be reached by drivers going in either direction. Adjoining the northern rest area is a motel. With the A 3's extension from Offenbach to Würzburg in the 1960s, both service centres, for the first time in Germany, were outfitted as automats. This concept, however, was abandoned in the early 1980s and they were converted to self-service restaurants.\n\nThe western residential areas are linked by the 11 km-long Rodgau-Ring-Straße (ringroad), which in the north runs on to Heusenstamm and Offenbach. The Dietzenbach-Rodgau-Seligenstadt cross-district road links Rodgau once again to the A 3. Weiskirchen is furthermore linked to the A 3 through the Obertshausen interchange.\n\nSince 2001, six heavily used intersections within Rodgau town limits have been replaced with roundabouts with raised, plant-covered islands. To reduce traffic in residential areas, four further, small roundabouts have been built.\n\nAt the bathing lake in Nieder-Roden there are roughly 2,000 parking places right near the entrance to the bathing beach. At all six S-Bahn stations, 400 “park & ride” places are available all together. Jügesheim has at its disposal two underground parking garages in the community core, and at the community centres in Dudenhofen, Weiskirchen and Nieder-Roden, and at every sport hall are found major carparks. Even the five forest leisure facilities offer goodly parking, as does the hiking carpark in the eastern woods on the \"Lange Schneise\" (“Long Aisle”).\n\nThe proximity to Frankfurt Airport – and the easy access thereto afforded by the S-Bahn – make possible international economic links. Of course, holidaymakers also benefit from this proximity.\n\nBetween Offenbach and Darmstadt, some 25 km from Rodgau, lies Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport, the busiest airport for general aviation in Germany. With its roughly 77,000 movements each year, it relieves and complements Frankfurt Airport.\n\nThe widely distributed daily newspapers \"Frankfurter Rundschau\" and \"Offenbach-Post\" contain in their editions for the Offenbach district a Rodgau local section. Also, on Thursdays comes the free \"Rodgau-Post\" from the \"Offenbach-Post’s\" publishing house. Also free are two further locally oriented weekly newspapers which are delivered to households, the \"Bürgerblatt\" and the \"Rodgau-Zeitung\". Also, the \"Dreieich-Spiegel\" deals with Rodgau happenings peripherally.\n\nMany households in Rodgau can choose to have a supply of 32 television and 35 radio channels over the cable network run by Unitymedia. The signals are fed into the system at the Rödermark centre. Since 2005, Rodgau has also had a broadband network which can bring digital television and radio channels to every household.\n\nOn 28 May 2006, transmission of analogue television signals to Rodgau from the Großer Feldberg and Würzberg Transmitters ended. Digital terrestrial broadcasting (DVB-T) took over broadcasting over the area the next day. Since then Rodgau has lain in the broadcast areas of the Großer Feldberg and Frankfurt Transmitters. Reception of the broadcast television signal has been forecast throughout the town according to whether a mere indoor antenna will be enough to receive it or a simple outdoor antenna. The map at the side shows the areas in which each kind of antenna should be used.\n\nOwing to the proximity to the economic metropolis of Frankfurt, Rodgau lies within the reporting area of the following radio stations:\n\nSince August 2008, the local radio station K.C.-Radio in the Rodgau constituent community of Jügesheim has been on the air.\n\nGiven each constituent community's original village structure, their natural centres each lay around the church. This was so even after the merger into the greater community in 1977, except for Nieder-Roden. There, beginning in 1950, the fivefold swelling of the population demanded that residential building be expanded heavily towards the northwest, establishing the so-called \"Gartenstadt\" (“Garden Town”), and that a new community core be developed, with a post office, shops, a clinic, and a community and social services centre. Here, under planning by the \"Baugilde Süd\" (“Building Guild South”) also arose in the late 1960s several developments of compact dwellings with up to twelve floors. Most striking in today's skyline is the development known locally as the \"Chinamauer\" (“China Wall”), a roughly 300 m-long block of maisonette flats. The original plan called for the development to be 900 m long, but this never came about.\n\nDespite the town's neverending growth, it has no hospital. The nearest one is found in Seligenstadt.\n\nCarefully laying out new building developments since 1979 has on the one hand made possible the population growth that has led to the current levels, but on the other hand it has also led to the establishment of the needed social infrastructure such as kindergartens, schools, and sport and leisure facilities. Although the town has slowly been growing together, as yet there is no true town centre. The individual constituent communities look after their own structures as they have thus far grown.\n\nSince 1998, the \"Lokale Agenda 21\" has been flowing as the leading stream of thought in shaping the town. A board of dedicated citizens developed a guiding image for the townsfolk whose goal is sustainability as a “roof” for economy, environment, social services, culture, one world, and so on. The board was granted an advisory function to town council and the right to speak at council meetings, and it worked out suggestions for, among other things, renaturalization and desegregation. Since 2002, the Agenda 21 Quality Phase has been running, that is to say the actual implementation of the suggestions until 2017. The board itself was dissolved in 2003 after the end of the Growth Phase (1998–2002).\n\nAt five Evangelical and six Catholic churches and community centres, regular services are held. The Islamic community gathers at a small mosque in Nieder-Roden. Evangelical Christians number 25.5% in Rodgau, Catholics 39.0%. The other 35.5% either belong to other denominations, or adhere to no faith.\n\nOn Rodgau-Weiskirchen's eastern outskirts, there has been since 1982 a conference and training centre of the Catholic International Apostolic Schönstatt Movement in the Bishopric of Mainz.\n\nBesides 25 kindergartens, there is in Rodgau – owing in some measure to the long time during which the current constituent communities were self-administering – a broad array of different kinds of school. There is the Gymnasium upper level at the Claus-von-Stauffenberg-Schule in Dudenhofen with grade levels 11 to 13. There are the Georg-Büchner-Schule in Jügesheim and the Geschwister-Scholl-Schule in Hainhausen, both coöperative comprehensive schools, and also the Heinrich-Böll-Schule in Nieder-Roden, an integrated comprehensive school. There are six primary schools: the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Grundschule in Dudenhofen, the Carl-Orff-Schule in Jügesheim, the Gartenstadt-Schule in Nieder-Roden, the Grundschule am Bürgerhaus in Nieder-Roden, the Münchhausen-Schule in Hainhausen and the Wilhelm-Busch-Schule in Jügesheim. The Georg-Büchner-Schule, the Heinrich-Böll-Schule, the Geschwister-Scholl-Schule and a few other schools located elsewhere form a school league within whose framework an exchange of experience and the planning of common projects and classwork take place. Moreover, there is in Weiskirchen the Friedrich-von-Bodelschwingh-Schule für Praktisch Bildbare (special school for trainable pupils). The town also maintains a folk high school and promotes the Freie Musikschule Rodgau.\n\nBesides the bathing beach on the 32.4 ha Rodgausee with its up to 300,000 visitors yearly, there are several forest recreational facilities, barbecue pits and two miniature golf courses within town limits. Those who play sports have on hand three sport centres, five sport fields, five sport halls with several functions, four gymnasia, two fitness paths and several horseback riding facilities. Seven tennis facilities and a tennis hall are likewise among the offerings, along with a beach volleyball facility with three courts at the bathing beach and a big skating facility. Sporting life in Rodgau is in the care of 55 sport clubs in the town.\n\nAmong the regular yearly highlights in municipal sport are the 50-km-Ultramarathon Rodgau run by RLT Rodgau in January, a triathlon in August, the 24-Stunden-Lauf Rodgau (24-hour walk) in September and the Drachenfest (“Dragon Festival”), likewise in September.\n\nForty-nine clubs nurture the town's cultural life with many choir and orchestra concerts, readings, theatrical productions, dance tournaments, art exhibitions and workshops. The town's cultural office yearly offers a theatre season (three subscription series) with well-known artists and the regionally noted art exhibition at the Nieder-Roden community centre.\n\nTwo other community centres are found in the constituent communities of Weiskirchen and Dudenhofen.\n\nIn the constituent communities of Weiskirchen Jügesheim and Nieder-Roden, “homeland clubs” take it upon themselves to run museums whose collections deal with each community's history. On Friedensstraße in Nieder-Roden is found the region's only \"DDR-Museum\" (“East Germany Museum”). This museum offers a detailed overview of what were once the consequences of a divided Germany.\n\nFour cinemas and seven public libraries round the cultural life out.\n\nSince 1979, the €2,500 “Cultural Prize of the Town of Rodgau” (\"Kulturpreis der Stadt Rodgau\") for outstanding performance by a Rodgau artist or project has been given out every year, since 1992 alternating with the “Cultural Promotion Prize” (\"Kulturförderpreis\"), specially for young artists.\n\nRodgau became well known countrywide for hits by the band the Rodgau Monotones, for example \"St. Tropez am Baggersee\" (“St. Tropez on the Quarry Pond”, which is the nickname for the local bathing beach in the town) or \"Erbarme, die Hesse komme\" (“Have mercy, the Hessians are coming”). The Rodgau Monotones received the Cultural Prize of the Town of Rodgau in 1983.\n\nIn Rodgau, four amateur theatrical groups, whose productions are a firm part of Rodgau's cultural life, are active on a club level. The Nieder-Roden group \"Das Große Welttheater\", having gained note among thousands of spectators both in and beyond the region for its theatre projects, won the Cultural Prize in 1996 and the Cultural Promotion Prize in 2000.\n\nFasching (Fastnacht, Fassenacht) is celebrated lustily in Rodgau. Said to be the Carnival's stronghold in Rodgau is Jügesheim (dialectal name: \"Giesem\"). Here, before the Town hall on 11 November, the opening of the “campaign” takes place, and on the Saturday before Ash Wednesday the opening of the “Town Hall storm”, the symbolic transfer of the town's administration to the fools. On the Thursday before Ash Wednesday the Carnival parade winds its way through Jügesheim's streets.\n\nThe Carnival representatives, the Carnival Prince and Princess and the Child Prince and Princess, have in more recent times not always come from Jügesheim. Other constituent communities may now enter contestants.\n\nAn historic town core is something that Rodgau, given the way it came into being, simply cannot offer. A lack of awareness of the worth of old buildings led, especially in the years after the Second World War, to the wholesale destruction of many timber-frame buildings in the old communities. Only in the early 1970s were historical buildings that were still standing systematically catalogued and ranked according to criteria for monumental protection.\n\nThe five former village churches from the 13th to 19th centuries even today still mark the old village cores. In the 1990s, with the church parishes’, the municipality's and many volunteers’ support, they were renovated and also put back in their original states. The Gothic tower at the Matthias-Kirche (“Saint Matthew’s Church”) in Nieder-Roden is Rodgau's oldest preserved building. Within the churches themselves are found objects of importance to art history from various epochs. Particularly worthy of mention among these is the Late Gothic Marienaltar (“Mary’s Altar”) in Nieder-Roden's Catholic Matthias-Kirche, which comes from the time about 1520, and is ascribed to the Riemenschneider school.\n\nSingle timber-frame houses scattered about the municipal area from the 16th to 19th centuries have been restored and today adorn the old village cores. A few buildings, such as the bakehouse (\"Backes\") in Dudenhofen have been built once again from old plans.\n\nThe watertower in Jügesheim, opened in 1938 and operated until 1979 is said from its architectural uniqueness and bold static construction to be an industrial monument. It shows clear echoes of the expressionistic style of the 1920s.\n\nThree of the four railway station buildings on the former Rodgaubahn opened in 1896 are said to be worthy of preservation, but are still awaiting renovation and new uses. Another historical building is an old fire station in which is housed the Weiskirchen local history museum.\n\nWorth seeing, too, are the eleven artistically made fountains as well as many sculptures and façade paintings that characterize the town.\n\nMany dedicated citizens contribute to the further bettering of the town's appearance through donations, street festivals and hands-on work, and to the building and expansion of a civic culture.\n\nA further highlight of Rodgau is the Drachenfest (“Kite Festival”) with its firework contest, held every year in late September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kick start mechanisms were almost universally a part of motorcycle engines before the mid-1970s, and were phased out of production over the next twenty years or so as electric starters became standard equipment. There are still some motorcycles produced that have both kick and electric starters. \n\nMany mopeds and scooters also carry both a kick start and an electric start, the former being useful in case the latter fails, as scooter and moped batteries tend to be smaller and, as a result, run down much faster than other forms of automotive batteries. Also, it is usually not possible to push start a moped or scooter with automatic transmission.\n\nLarger motorcycles featured a manual compression release mechanism that made starting easier while modern units did this automatically through a cable attached to the kick start lever.\n\nToday, dedicated off-road motorcycles and many ATVs use kick start systems, due to the increased weight of electric starters. The majority of the inexpensive two-wheelers and sometimes three-wheelers in developing countries, also use kick start levers.\nBefore starting, kickstart levers are generally unfolded from the side of the motorcycle so that the rider can clear the side of the engine as it rotates. As the lever begins to descend under the riders foot, the rachet engages a gear linked to the crankshaft causing it to spin past top dead center so that an ignition spark can ignite the compressed fuel mixture. Upon starting, the rachet disengages and the rider folds the lever back. \n\nOn some large displacement twins or singles, 'kickback' can occur if the fuel ignites before the piston reaches top dead center. This causes the crank to spin backwards and can be painful for the rider as the lever kicks back on their foot.\n\nThe first kick start motorcycle was a British Scott Motorcycle two-stroke twin manufactured in 1910.\n\nSome scooters have kick starters with a tendency not to always work, if not performed correctly. Some manufacturers have also included kick starters in their models, only for a purpose of introducing apparent convenience for ignition, as opposed to offering a reliable alternative for an electric starter.\n\n"}

In Arunachal Pradesh alone the Tani-speaking area covers some 40,000 square kilometers, or roughly half the size of the state. Scattered Tani communities spill over the Sino-Indian border into adjacent areas in Mêdog (Miguba people), Mainling (Bokar and Tagin peoples), and Lhünzê (Bangni, Na, Bayi, Dazu, and Mara peoples) counties of Tibet, where together with the non-Tani Idu and Taraon they form the Lhoba nationality.\n\nThe Tani languages are conservatively classified as a distinct branch in Sino-Tibetan. Their closest relatives may be their eastern neighbors the Digaro languages, Taraon and Idu; this was first suggested by Sun (1993), but a relationship has not yet been systematically demonstrated. Blench (2014) suggests that Tani has a Greater Siangic substratum, with the Greater Siangic languages being a non-Sino-Tibetan language family consisting of Idu-Taraon and Siangic languages.\n\nMark Post (2015) observes that Tani typologically fits into the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, which typically has creoloid morphosyntactic patterns, rather than with the languages of the Tibetosphere. Post (2015) also notes that Tani culture is similar to those of Mainland Southeast Asian hill tribe cultures, and is not particularly adapted to cold montane environments.\n\nA provisional classification in Sun (1993), who argued that Tani is a primary branch of Tibeto-Burman (within Sino-Tibetan), is:\n\n\nTo Eastern Tani, van Driem (2008) adds the following possible languages:\n\nMilang has traditionally been classified as a divergent Tani language, but in 2011 was tentatively reclassified as Siangic (Post & Blench 2011).\n\nProto-Tani was partially reconstructed by Sun (1993). A large number of reconstructed roots have cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages. However, a great deal of Proto-Tani vocabulary have no cognates within Sino-Tibetan (Post 2011), and most Tani grammar seems to be secondary, without cognates in grammatically conservative Sino-Tibetan languages such as Jingpho or the Kiranti languages (Post 2006). Post (2012) suggests that Apatani and Milang have non-Tani substrata, and that as early Tani languages had expanded deeper into Arunachal Pradesh, mixing with non-Tani languages occurred.\n\nMark Post (2013) proposes the following revised classification for the Tani languages.\n\n\nSun (1993: 254-255) lists the following 25 lexical isoglosses between Western Tani and Eastern Tani.\n\n\n"}

It has four districts and a total land area of 7,335 hectares. The total number of dwellings in Sheberghān is 19,511.\n\nSheberghān is located along the Safid River banks, about west of Mazari Sharif on the national primary ring road that connects Kabul, Puli Khumri, Mazari Sharif, Sheberghān, Maymana, Herat, Kandahar, Ghazni, and Maidan Shar. Sheberghān airport is situated between Sheberghān and Aqchah.\n\nThe city's name is a corruption of its classical Persian name, Shaporgân, meaning \"[King] Shapur's town\". Shapur was the name of two Sasanian kings, both of whom built a great number of cities. However, Shapur I was the governor of the eastern provinces of the empire, and it is more likely that he is the builder of a roadway between a few important cities. These include Nishapur and Bishapur in Iran, and Peshawar in Pakistan.\n\nAfter Maymana, Sheberghan is the second most important Uzbek-dominated city in all of Afghanistan. Uzbek is the mother language of a majority of its inhabitants. Large numbers of Tajiks, Hazaras, Pashtuns, and Arabs live in the city. In 1856, J. P. Ferrier wrote: \"Sheberghān is a town containing 12,000 souls. Uzbeks being in the great majority.\"\n\nThe Sheberghān \"Arabs\" are all Persian-speaking, even though they claim an Arab identity. There are other such Persian and Pashto-speaking \"Arabs\" to the east, with pockets residing in Mazar-i Sharif, Kholm, Kunduz, and Jalalabad. Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity, and may in fact point to the Arab migration of the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales in the wake of the Islamic conquests of the region.\n\nSheberghān was once a flourishing settlement along the Silk Road. In 1978, Soviet archaeologists discovered the famed Bactrian Gold in the village of Tillia Tepe outside Sheberghān. In the 13th century Marco Polo visited the city and later wrote about its honey-sweet melons. Sheberghān became the capital of an independent Uzbek khanate that was allotted to Afghanistan by the 1873 Anglo-Russian border agreement.\n\nSheberghān has for millennia been the focal point of power in the northeast corner of Bactria. It still sits astride the main route between Balkh and Herat, and controls the direct route north to the Amu Darya, about 90 km away, as well as the important branch route south to Sar-e Pol.\nIn 1856, J. P. Ferrier reported:\n\nThe heavily-fortified town of Yemshi-tepe, just five kilometres to the northeast of modern Sheberghān, on the road to Akcha, is only about from the famous necropolis of Tillia Tepe, where an immense treasure was excavated from the graves of the local royal family by a joint Soviet-Afghan archaeological effort from 1969 to 1979. In 1977, a Soviet-Afghan archaeological team began excavations 5 km north of the town for relics. They uncovered mud-brick columns and a cross-shaped altar of an ancient temple dating back to at least 1000 B.C. Six royal tombs were excavated at Tillia Tepe revealing a vast amount of gold and other treasures. Several coins dated to the early 1st century C.E., with none dated later.\n\nSheberghān has been proposed as the site of ancient Xidun, one of the five \"xihou\", or divisions, of the early Kushan Empire.\n\nSheberghān was the site of the Dasht-i-Leili massacre in December 2001 during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in which 250 to 3,000 (depending on sources) Taliban prisoners were shot or suffocated to death in metal truck containers, while being transferred by American and Northern Alliance soldiers from Kunduz to a Sheberghān prison.\n\nSheberghān was the stronghold of Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who had been vying with his Tajik rival General Mohammed Atta for control of northern Afghanistan.\n\nSheberghān is a trading and transit hub in northern Afghanistan. Agriculture accounts for 50% of the 7,335 hectares within the municipal boundaries. 23% of the land is residential, and largely clustered in the central area, but well distributed through the four districts.\n\nSheberghān has a cool, semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSk\") with hot summers and chilly, though variable, winters. There is moderate rainfall and some snowfall from January to March, but the rest of the year is dry, especially the summer.\n\nSheberghān is surrounded by irrigated agricultural land.\n\nWith Soviet assistance, exploitation of Afghanistan's natural gas reserves began in 1967 at the Khowaja Gogerak field, 15 kilometers east of Sheberghān in Jowzjan Province. The field's reserves were thought to be 67 billion cubic meters. In 1967, the Soviets also completed a 100-kilometer gas pipeline linking Keleft in the Soviet Union with Sheberghān.\n\nTo demonstrate how natural gas reserves could be used as an alternative to expensive petroleum imports, the United States Department of Defense spent $43 million on a natural gas filling station.\n\nSheberghān is important to the energy infrastructure of Afghanistan:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The remaining ancient walls have a total length of 1,000 km and constitute less than 20% of the original wall system.\n\nAccording to a legend, the earthworks are results of ancient events when a mythical hero (bohatyr) Kozmodemian (or Borysohlib) in order to slay gargantuan Dragon (Serpent) harnessed it in a giant plow and furrowed. The Dragon (Serpent) bit the dust and from plowing there were left furrows on both sides of which towered immense chunks of earth that among people were named as Serpent's Wall.\n\nThe ancient walls were built between the 2nd century BC and 7th century AD, according to carbon dating. There are three theories as to what peoples built the walls: either the Sarmatians against the Scythians, or the Goths of Oium against the Huns, or the Early East Slavs against the nomads of the southern steppes. In Slavic culture, the warlike nomads are often associated with the winged dragon, hence the name.\n\nOn the right bank of Dnieper between its tributaries Teteriv and Ros the remnants of wall create six lines elongated from west to east. One Serpent's Wall was passed over the left bank of Dnieper and its tributary Sula.\n\nThe 1974-85 explorations has established that Serpent's Wall is a remnant of wooded earth fortifications built at the end of 10th and the first half of 11th centuries, smaller part in the 12th century, to protect middle Dnieper Ukraine and Kiev from pechenegs and cumans.\n\n"}

Inspired by the memoir of the same title by gay historian Martin Duberman, \"Stonewall\" is a fictionalized account of the weeks leading up to the Stonewall riots, a seminal event in the modern American gay rights movement. The film stars Guillermo Díaz, Frederick Weller, Brendan Corbalis, and Duane Boutte.\n\nWhile the film is a work of fiction, Finch makes the unusual directorial choice of including documentary-style interview footage with several people who were at the Stonewall Inn during the uprising. Finch also intersperses lip synch numbers performed by the actors throughout the film to function as something of a Greek chorus.\n\nMatty Dean, a young gay man, arrives in New York City and heads for Greenwich Village. He falls in with crossdressing sex worker La Miranda and friends, who take him to Stonewall Inn. There is a police raid and Matty and La Miranda are arrested. They are bailed out by Bostonia, the African-American \"mother\" of the queens who hang out at Stonewall, and the secret lover of Vinnie, the deeply closeted mafioso who runs Stonewall. Matty and La Miranda go back to her place where she receives her draft notice. Matty attends a meeting of the Mattachine Society, where he meets Burt and Ethan. The group is planning a picket at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Ethan and Matty witness an initiation of sorts as a young man named José becomes the persona Camelia. After the ceremony they return to La Miranda's place and have sex.\n\nMatty spends time with Ethan, who is a writer under a pseudonym for a homophile magazine. La Miranda reports to the induction center in full drag and is ordered to go for psychological evaluation. La Miranda is terrified because of former bad experiences with psychiatrists, so Matty dons her clothes and meets with the doctor in her place, securing a rejection from military service for her as a \"sexual deviant.\" On the subway ride home, Matty tells La Miranda he loves her.\n\nAt a Mattachine meeting, Matty is disgusted by the guest speaker, a psychiatrist who discourses on the then-current disease model of homosexuality, and leaves. After the meeting Burt, Ethan and Matty argue about it on their way to meet with a reporter and photographer from the Village Voice newspaper. The group stages a \"sip-in,\" trying to illustrate discriminatory alcohol service laws by being refused service but no one refuses to serve them until they go to Stonewall. At the bar La Miranda and Ethan meet and Ethan treats her mockingly. La Miranda realizes that Matty hasn't told his Mattachine friends about her and storms out. Matty follows and they argue about La Miranda's refusal to conform and Matty's feeling the need to be with more masculine men. Matty seeks out Ethan and they begin an affair.\n\nVinnie points out a clinic he calls the \"Palace of Dreams\" and tells Bostonia that he wants her to have sex reassignment surgery so that they can marry, but she is opposed to the idea.\n\nFollowing the Philadelphia picket, Ethan takes Matty to Fire Island. Given the choice between Ethan's acceptance of discrimination and La Miranda's defiance, Matty chooses La Miranda and they reconcile.\n\nIt is the day of Judy Garland's death. Bostonia watches the television coverage. To cheer her up, Vinnie takes her out in full drag in public for the first time. They have ice cream at a fancy restaurant, their open affection drawing disapproving stares and are asked to leave by the manager.\n\nAs they wake up together the next morning, Vinnie asks Bostonia if he's ever told her that he loves her. She says no. Vinnie suddenly commits suicide with a bullet through the head and Bostonia becomes hysterical. Vinnie has left her a large amount of cash and scrawled \"I LOVE YOU\" on a mirror in lipstick.\n\nThat night at Stonewall there's another raid. Several of the queens are arrested, including Bostonia. She smashes a police officer in the face and is attacked by other cops. When other queens fight back, touching off the riots that would mark the beginning of the gay community's militant advocacy movement for its rights.\n\n\nAlthough the film is based on true events, there are some factual inaccuracies.

Closing on December 12, 1996, it grossed $692,400.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 63% score based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.\n\n\n\"Stonewall\" was released on VHS tape in the 1996 by Tartan Video.

The introduction of NMPs in September 1990, effected to bring more independent voices into Parliament, was an important modification of the traditional Westminster parliamentary system that Singapore had.\n\nNMPs are appointed for a term of two and a half years on the recommendation of a Special Select Committee chaired by the Speaker of Parliament. The Committee may nominate persons who have rendered distinguished public service or who have brought honour to Singapore, and also invites proposals of candidates from community groups in the fields of arts and letters, culture, the sciences, business, industry, the professions, social or community service, and the labour movement. In 2009, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong proposed in Parliament that the Committee should also invite nominations from the civil society such as candidates from the environmental movement, young activists, new citizens, and community and grassroots leaders. In addition, the Committee must have regard to the need for NMPs to reflect as wide a range of independent and nonpartisan views as possible.\n\nIn Parliament, NMPs can participate in debates and vote on all issues except amendments to the Constitution, motions relating to public funds, votes of no confidence in the Government, and removing the President from office.\n\nThe NMP scheme has been criticized on the grounds that it is undemocratic, and that unelected NMPs have no incentive to express the electorate's views in Parliament. It has also been claimed that the scheme reinforces the ruling People's Action Party's technocratic and elitist view of politics. On the other hand, it is said that NMPs have placed pressure on PAP MPs to be more competent in Parliament.\n\nNMPs have made contributions to Singapore's political landscape. In 1996, the Maintenance of Parents Act () became the first public Act originating from a private member's bill initiated by an NMP, Walter Woon. During parliamentary debates, NMPs have also offered critical views on Government policies. The scheme was declared a success by the Prime Minister in 2009, and NMPs were made a permanent feature of Parliament – before this change, Parliament had to resolve within six months of every election whether NMPs should be appointed.\n\nA Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) is a member of the Parliament of Singapore (MP) who is not elected, but chosen by a committee of MPs. Introducing the NMP scheme was a progression of the plan by the Government, the first step of which was the introduction of the Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme, to increase the number of non-government MPs to enable \"alternative views to be expressed and dissenting voices to be heard\".\n\nDuring a debate in Parliament on 29 and 30 November 1989, the First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong set out the Government's reasons for implementing the scheme. The NMP scheme was a move to provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to participate in politics. It was a \"privilege\" extended to Singaporeans who could make valuable contributions to public policy but for good reasons did not desire to enter politics and look after constituencies. Women were mentioned as an example of people who might be more willing to become NMPs, as many have to handle their families and careers and therefore do not have much spare time.\n\nThe aim of the scheme was to create a more \"consensual style of government where alternative views are heard and constructive dissent accommodated\". NMPs could play a constructive role in contributing to good governance that the Opposition and MPs of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) could not provide. While PAP MPs had been encouraged to air opposing views, they were after all Government MPs and were not allowed to vote against the Government unless the Whip was lifted. Moreover, there were very few Opposition MPs. According to Goh, the Opposition had not been constructive as their objective was to discredit the Government so that they could win office. In contrast, NMPs would not belong to any political party, and could therefore represent the views of people who did not identify themselves with the PAP or the Opposition. Thus, NMPs would be able to concentrate on the \"substance of the debate rather than form and rhetoric\", and provide dissenting and constructive views that would contribute to good government.\n\nFurthermore, with NMPs Parliament would be able to better represent the views of the people. While the ruling party attempted to represent the mainstream political opinion in Singapore and fielded as representative a range of candidates as possible during general elections, it would inevitably not be able to succeed in completely representing every viewpoint. On the other hand, the Opposition MPs and NCMPs represented anti-establishment voters. Goh expressed the view that people who stood as Opposition candidates usually believed that having the PAP government was bad for Singapore and wished to oust the PAP. Therefore, the range of people likely to be elected to Parliament as Opposition MPs was limited. NMPs could represent the people who disagreed with the PAP but did not wish to oust them from government.\n\nGoh also pointed out that at least 20 other countries had nominated Members in their Houses of Representatives, while noting that each variant of the NMP system had to be tailored to the country in which it was implemented.\n\nThe bill for amending the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to implement the NMP scheme was introduced in Parliament and underwent its First Reading on 6 October 1989. On 30 November 1989, the bill was read a second time, and referred to a select committee. The report of the select committee was presented to Parliament on 15 March 1990, and the bill read a third time and enacted as the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1990 on 29 March 1990. It came into force on 10 September 1990.\n\nFrom 1 September 1997, the maximum number of NMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine. Introducing a motion in Parliament for the second reading of the constitutional amendment bill that was eventually passed to effect the change, the Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng said that the NMP scheme was now well accepted by practically all MPs as it had proven its usefulness and worth. The Government intended to expand the scheme \"so that more NMPs can be in Parliament to air views which may not be canvassed by the PAP or by the Opposition. ... We are now proposing to increase the number of NMPs so that a wider cross-section of such views can be canvassed and expressed.\"\n\nIn 2002, an NMP's term of office was extended from two to two and a half years. This was done to avoid the need to select NMPs three times if a particular Parliament lasted its full five-year term. In fact, during the Ninth Parliament, the NMPs had only served 17 days from 1 to 17 October 2001 and attended three sittings before Parliament was dissolved for the 2001 general election.\n\nNMPs were made a permanent feature of Parliament with effect from 1 July 2010. Prior to this change, Parliament had to decide within six months after every election whether to appoint NMPs. The rationale for the changes was given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Parliament on 27 May 2009. According to him, the main motivation behind having NMPs as a permanent part of the system of government in Singapore was the fact that the scheme had been a great success and had improved the quality of debate in the House: \"The scheme has worked well. The NMPs represent non-partisan alternative views in Parliament, and the NMPs have made effective contributions and raised the quality of debate in Parliament. Sometimes, if I may say so, they may have outshone even the Opposition MPs. This NMP scheme should be a permanent part of our political system.\"\n\nThe Fourth Schedule of the Constitution sets out the process for the appointment of NMPs.\nA Special Select Committee chaired by the Speaker of Parliament and consisting of seven other MPs nominates not more than nine persons to be appointed as NMPs by the President. The Committee may nominate persons who have rendered distinguished public service or who have brought honour to Singapore, and also invites the general public and groups in the community to submit the names of persons who may be considered for nomination by the Committee. These community groups are in the fields of arts and letters, culture, the sciences, business, industry, the professions, social or community service, and the labour movement. In 2009, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong proposed in Parliament that the Committee should also invite nominations from the people sector such as candidates from the environmental movement, young activists, new citizens, and community and grassroots leaders. He felt that \"[t]his will give civil society a voice in Parliament and encourage civil society to grow and to mature further\". In addition, nominees may be persons who have rendered distinguished public service or who have brought honour to Singapore, and the Committee must have regard to the need for NMPs to reflect as wide a range of independent and non-partisan views as possible. However, a person appointed as an NMP is not required to resign from any political party that he or she is a member of. When this issue was considered by a select committee of Parliament, it took the following view:\n\nThe usual term of office for an NMP is two and a half years from the date of appointment. NMPs must vacate their seats if they stand as candidates for any political parties in elections, or if they are elected as MPs for any constituencies. In addition, like other MPs, an NMP ceases to be a Member of Parliament when Parliament is dissolved, or in a number of situations specified in the Constitution such as ceasing to be a Singapore citizen, resignation or bankruptcy.\n\nNMPs can vote in Parliament on any bill or motion, except a bill to amend the Constitution; a supply bill, supplementary supply bill or final supply bill; a money bill; a vote of no confidence in the Government; and removing the President from office. However, NMPs can still voice their opinions and join debates on the bills and motions they cannot vote on.\n\nDuring the Parliamentary debates that led to the introduction of the NMP scheme, it was argued by a number of PAP MPs such as Dr. Arthur Beng, Dr. Tan Cheng Bock, Dr. Dixie Tan, and Dr. Aline Wong that the scheme is undemocratic in nature given the fact that NMPs are nominated rather than elected by the people for the people. However, in accordance with party discipline, they were eventually required to vote in favour of the constitutional amendment. As Beng said: \"This is the constraint upon us, and I guess I will have to continue to live a schizophrenic political life – speaking against, yet voting for a Bill.\"\n\nSecondly, it was argued by Chiam See Tong, the Leader of the Opposition, that since Singapore practices representative democracy, NMPs are useless to the people as, being unelected, they have no incentive to present their views to Parliament. In other words, one should not enjoy the privilege of representing views without bearing the responsibility of serving those whom one represents. The Opposition perceived the scheme as a plan to make it look unnecessary. A similar point has been made by an academic, Chua Beng Huat, who has argued that the NMP scheme co-opts more moderate dissenting voices and is thus an attempt to de-legitimize the need for more aggressive opposition.\n\nFrom the beginning, the process of appointing NMPs has been weighted towards functional representation of discrete interests. For example, Wong Kan Seng, the Leader of the House, said in Parliament on 5 April 2002:\n\nGarry Rodan has expressed the view that, in effect, the NMP scheme reinforces the PAP's technocratic and elitist view of politics.\n\nIn support of the scheme, NMP Paulin Tay Straughan said in Parliament on 26 April 2010 that it neither compromises the democratic process nor perpetuates the dominance of the ruling party, because during elections Singaporeans vote for the political parties that best represent their interests and ideals, and the presence of NMPs in the House does not factor into this choice. In her view, NMPs add value to the discourse taking place in Parliament as they are able to \"explore and research the issues from all possible socially significant angles\" without constraint from \"partisan concerns\". She felt personally that she was accountable to all Singaporeans, rather than being unaccountable to anybody. In addition, Ho Khai Leong has opined that the presence of NMPs and their participation in Parliamentary debates have placed pressure on PAP MPs to be less complacent and to be more competent in Parliament.\n\nNon-constituency Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim has stated that it is the Workers' Party's position that the NMP scheme cannot be improved as it goes against the most fundamental democratic ideals of fair representation and elections. Despite such calls to do away entirely with the NMP system, there are also those who believe in the scheme and have raised points for its improvement. NMP Viswa Sadasivan has expressed the view that the scheme serves a function and purpose in the current socio-political climate, though it should not be viewed as a permanent solution for Singapore. The scheme could evolve into a selection–election hybrid, or the selection process itself could become more transparent with clearer criteria on which candidates and selected NMPs alike could be assessed.\n\nIt has also been recommended that fringe or minority groups should go through formal, mandatory elections to choose the representatives that will provide them with a voice in Parliament. Thereafter, they may be called \"elected representatives\". The Government may assist by providing guidelines for the conduct of proper elections. Furthermore, the maximum number of NMPs – nine – is said to be far too small to ensure proper representation of minority groups. Hence, it has been recommended that there should not be any limitation on the number of NMPs.\n\nThe first two NMPs appointed with effect from 22 November 1990 were cardiologist Professor Maurice Choo and company executive Leong Chee Whye.\n\nAs of December 2010, one NMP – Professor Walter Woon Cheong Ming, a law lecturer at the National University of Singapore – had succeeded in having a public law enacted based on a private member's bill he or she had initiated. The law in question is the Maintenance of Parents Act, which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them. The bill was introduced in Parliament by Woon on 23 May 1994, and eventually passed on 2 November 1995. In that year, the first woman NMP, Dr. Kanwaljit Soin, also introduced a Family Violence Bill but it did not pass.\n\nFollowing his term as an NMP, Gerard Ee, a Roman Catholic, was invited in November 2002 to join a team of seven parliamentarians of different faiths tasked to refine the Declaration of Religious Harmony, which was presented as the product of interfaith dialogue and understanding. This is an example of how NMPs have influenced soft law and the legal culture in Singapore.\n\nIn 2009, the arts community became the first group among the functional groups that NMPs are meant to represent to undertake an open election process to pick the candidates of their choice. It choose Audrey Wong and Loretta Chen, and submitted their names to the authorities. Audrey Wong was selected to become the first \"Arts\" NMP, and served from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, the arts community underwent the same process and elected Janice Koh as its candidate. She was appointed an NMP in 2012.\n\nOn 25 May 2009 during a debate in Parliament, Siew Kum Hong called for a hybrid Parliament in which a limited number of seats would be allocated by way of proportional representation, while the majority would still be filled the way they are now. He felt this would allow for more diverse views in Parliament, adding that it would be \"more consistent with democratic principles than a scheme like the Nominated MP scheme\". Siew also noted that while the act of voting was key to democracy and political participation, a large number of Singaporeans do not get to vote at each election because walkovers are prevalent.\n\nNMPs are supposed to be non-partisan but after it had been announced on 7 July 2009 that Calvin Cheng would be one of the nine people nominated to be NMPs it was disclosed by \"Today\" newspaper that he was a member of Young PAP, the youth wing of the People's Action Party. The following day, Cheng wrote to the newspaper stating that he had formally resigned from Young PAP on 8 July, and that in any case he had been an inactive member, having never collected his membership card or attended any PAP branch activities. This led to a journalist commenting that his attitude had been \"cavalier\" and \"whimsical\", and a Young PAP member writing on the Forum page of \"The Straits Times\" that his remarks had raised doubts about the Young PAP's credibility. The Constitution does not explicitly bar NMPs from being members of political parties, and Gerard Ee was also a PAP member when he was an NMP. He did not feel he had to resign, as since he was not subject to the party whip he would not be prevented from expressing independent views in Parliament. Despite these initial criticisms, \"The Straits Times\" reported that Cheng \"left the strongest impression on many elected Members of Parliament\", following speeches he made during his maiden budget debate in Parliament in 2010. In his final speech during Budget 2011 before Parliament was dissolved for the general election that year, Cheng argued for the Government to educate the Internet generation instead of regulating the Internet to deal with threats such as \"misinformation and disinformation\", calling it \"pointless\". He went on to say that the Internet might be a \"wild card\" during the general election.\n\nOn 18 August 2009, Viswa Sadasivan moved a motion for Parliament to reaffirm \"its commitment to the nation building tenets as enshrined in the National Pledge when debating national policies, especially economic policies\". He identified one of the tenets of the Pledge as the need to strive to become a \"united people, regardless of race, language or religion\", and expressed the view that Singaporean society needed to address \"apparent contradictions and mixed signals\" by unnecessarily emphasizing racial differences. He gave examples where this had occurred: the existence of ethnic based self-help groups, Special Assistance Plan schools and cultural elitism; policies concerning Malay-Muslims in the Singapore Armed Forces and maintaining the current racial distribution in the population; and discussions about whether Singapore was ready for an ethnic minority Prime Minister. The next day, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew refuted what he termed Viswa's \"false and flawed\" arguments, saying he wanted to \"bring the House back to earth\" on the issue of racial equality in Singapore. He noted that Articles 152 and 153 of the Constitution, which make it the Government's responsibility to care for racial and religious minorities and to recognize the special position of Malays as the indigenous people of Singapore, explicitly impose a duty on the Government not to treat everyone equally. He felt that the tenet in the Pledge that Viswa had referred to was only an aspiration: \"It is not reality, it is not practical, it will lead to grave and irreparable damage if we work on that principle. ... [W]e are trying to reach a position where there is a level playing field for everybody which is going to take decades, if not centuries, and we may never get there.\" Thus, it was not feasible to dismantle institutions that provided assistance to Singaporeans on an ethnic basis. It was the first time since 2007 that Lee had chosen to speak during a debate in Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1834249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834249", "title": "Catherine Hardwicke", "text": "Catherine Hardwicke\n\nHelen Catherine Hardwicke (born October 21, 1955) is an American film director, production designer, and screenwriter. Her directorial work includes \"Thirteen\" (2003), which she co-wrote with Nikki Reed, the film's co-star, \"Lords of Dogtown\" (2005), \"The Nativity Story\" (2006), \"Twilight\" (2008), \"Red Riding Hood\" (2011), \"Plush\" (2013), \"Miss You Already\" (2015), and \"Miss Bala\" (2019).\n\nHardwicke was born in Cameron, Texas on October 21, 1955, the daughter of Jamee Elberta (\"née\" Bennett) and John Benjamin Hardwicke. She has a brother, Jack, and a sister, Irene Hardwicke Olivieri, who became an artist. She grew up in McAllen on the U.S.–Mexico border, where her family owned and operated a farm along the Rio Grande, and was raised as a Presbyterian. She said the border area was wild: in high school, \"her principal was stabbed three times. A friend's father was shot in the back, and another friend was murdered. And yet life could be wonderful at the same time. 'It was a Huck Finn life, too,' she said.\" Growing up in McAllen, Hardwicke describes it as \"wild\". As a child she did not attend many movies and explains, \"I didn’t go to many movies. Let's be honest: It was a cultural wasteland. At the time, you could not go to a significant museum unless you drove three hours to Corpus Christi or four to San Antonio\". However, there were other ways to have fun such as sneaking over to the bars and nightclubs of Mexico before she was even a legal adult. Speaking on her early life Hardwicke says, \"It was a wonderful childhood. I'm dying to make a movie about it\".\n\nShe graduated from McAllen High School and went to the University of Texas at Austin, where she earned a degree in architecture. Among her post-graduation projects was designing the solar townhouse complex built around a man-made lake on the 20-acre site, complete with waterfalls and swimming pools. The property was owned by her father.\n\nAfter graduating from her hometown high school, McAllen High School, Hardwicke went on to attend the University of Texas at Austin. Studying Architecture, Hardwicke felt that she had far too much creativity for that field, stating: I was a little out there for architecture school. I would dress up like my building and people were like, \"wow, dude, architecture really doesn’t encourage that type of creativity\". Feeling limited, Hardwicke moved to Los Angeles, where she studied at UCLA film school to explore her creative talents. Hardwicke made her first short film for her brother Jack who was marrying Nicolette Cullen. During this period in the 1980s, Hardwicke made an award-winning short, \"Puppy Does the Gumbo\" and was recognized with a Nissan Focus Award was featured in the Landmark Best of UCLA film program.\n\nHardwicke became a production designer, working with film directors such as Cameron Crowe, Richard Linklater, and David O. Russell. She was influenced by them, gaining experience in their techniques, and learning informal aspects from professional conversations. She talked to some about her desire to be a filmmaker, and received advice and tips.\n\nWhile working with such big-name directors, she was able to study their techniques: \"I always told them I really want to make my own movies, and they were all very generous and gave me tips.\" Her career as a production designer was crucial and beneficial to the molding of her career as a director. Her time spent with these directors aided her and were able to give her a sense of direction: \"As you’re riding around with the director location scouting, you hear a lot of conversations and you start piecing them together, so I think that helped me.\" She even worked with fellow female director Lisa Cholodenko on her film \"Laurel Canyon\" (2002). Aside from her time spent working alongside directors, Hardwicke continued to work on her own projects such as scripts, short films, and teaching herself Final Cut Pro. Hardwicke even took it upon herself to take acting classes to become a better director.\n\nThrough the 1990s and early 2000s, Hardwicke worked as a production designer on films including \"Tombstone\" (1993), \"Tank Girl\" (1995), \"2 Days in the Valley\" (1996), \"The Newton Boys\" (1998), \"Three Kings\" (1999), and \"Antitrust\" (2001). In 2000, she worked as production designer with director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe and actor/producer Tom Cruise on \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001). That and \"Three Kings\" were noted for their original use of color-manipulation techniques to complement the narrative.\n\n\nHardwicke's first film as a director was developed by her in collaboration with then-fourteen-year-old Nikki Reed, who wrote a screenplay that reflected some of Reed's teenage experiences. Hardwicke had known Nikki since she was five years old, and after Hardwicke's relationship with Reed's father ended she continued to stay close with her. Hardwicke said \"I started getting my hair cut by her mother, which is similar to the film, so I saw them every few months\" she continues to say, \"when [Nikki] turned thirteen, I started noticing she had completely changed to becoming quite angry with her family, her mother, and herself. I started seeing all these changes and difficulties she was going through, so I thought, along with her parents, that if she could hang out with me, things would get better\". Throughout the time they spent together, Reed had revealed to Hardwicke that she was interested in acting which was the spark that ignited \"Thirteen\". They completed the script in six days during Christmas break. When asked why there was an urgency to make the film, Hardwicke replied with \"I felt it was almost like a snapshot of a particular time. I really wanted Nikki to be in it, because her energy was so inspiring to it, and I don't like the movies where the person is eighteen years old playing a thirteen-year-old, so I said, 'We're going to shoot it even if it's with a digital camera and me as the whole crew.\"' Evan Rachel Wood was contracted to star in the movie alongside Reed. The film tackles difficulties of contemporary teenagers. A young teen loses her innocence in a rapid spiral of events, with disturbing portrayals of drug use, sex, theft, and dropping out of school.\n\nReed and Hardwicke wrote the script from the point of view of Tracy, a \"normal\" 13-year-old who begins at a new middle school. There she meets Evie, who she thinks of as more advanced and whom she wants to impress. She hopes Evie will give her entree to what she thinks is an exciting \"crowd.\" Tracy's single mother Melanie, played by Holly Hunter, has tried to be a friend to her daughter and does not know how to deal with her changes. The film features female friendship and the difficulties of adolescence. Hardwicke has developed these as recurring themes in her work. The film received critical acclaim and had praise for its stars and Holly Hunter was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. \"Thirteen\" earned Hardwicke the directing award at Sundance in 2003.\n\n\nShe went on to direct this fictionalized account of skateboarding culture. The film is based on the documentary \"Dogtown and Z-Boys\" by Stacy Peralta, whom Hardwicke had worked with. As she lived in Venice Beach and knew most of the Z- Boys well from surfing, Hardwicke drew on personal experience in directing the film.\n\n\"Lords of Dogtown\" explores the young Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams as they revolutionize the world of skateboarding. Hardwicke has said that the drama film was not intended to compete with the documentary, but to express the perspective of people as they lived the events, rather than later recounting them. The technical work was acclaimed, from the skate tricks to the tricky camera work. Lance Mountain, legendary skater, cameraman and long-time friend of Peralta, shot the action while riding along behind the skateboarders.\n\n\nIn 2006, Hardwicke directed this biblical film for New Line Cinema. At first she was reluctant to take on the project as she worried about finding a fresh approach to the story at the heart of Christian culture. She began to consider Mary as a young girl faced with an incredible task, and also incorporated a psychological approach to Joseph and his issues. She put it in a context of contemporary teenagers. Hardwicke tried to dramatize the account of the Bible. Hardwicke wanted to cast a young actress as Mary, traditionally held to be about 14 or 15 at the time of Jesus' birth, given the age of marriage of girls in that culture. She wanted an actress who at least appeared to be Middle Eastern. She cast as her lead Keisha Castle-Hughes, the Oscar-nominated New Zealand actress of aborigine descent, who starred in \"Whale Rider\" (2002).\n\n\nHer direction of the film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novel, \"Twilight,\" was an international commercial success. The film is the first in the series produced by Summit Entertainment based on Meyer's four books. \"Twilight\" is the story of a teenage girl named Bella Swan dealing with her parents' separation, and living with her father after years of having little to do with him. They live in a small town in Washington where she tries to adjust to a new school. Her typical teenage trials change character as she develops a crush on an attractive young vampire. The film and its leads attracted fans all over the world. In Korea specifically, the success of the Twilight film produced many fan sites, art, marketing products, and even themed cafes. These cafes allowed fans to share their love for the film franchise as well as the novels. \n\nHardwicke shot the film in 44 days on a budget of $37 million, which was reduced because of rights issues to do with the book. As her main actress, Kristen Stewart, was a minor, she could work only five and a half hours per day. This significantly slowed down shooting for the project. Hardwicke was willing to deal with that difficulty, as she believed that Stewart was perfect for the role as Bella. Casting for the character of Edward Cullen was more difficult. The character had to look like a high school student but portray a cultured persona and the learning of a long life. Hardwicke found Robert Pattinson unique, with his own wide range of interests in art, literature and music; she thought him deep enough for the part. Its $400 million global success made her the most commercially successful woman film director.\n\nAmid rumors of a rocky relationship with Hardwicke, in 2008 Summit Entertainment announced that she would not direct the \"Twilight\" sequel, \"\". Hardwicke said it was her decision, although a blog reported she had been fired by Summit. She said, \"I couldn't even be fired, that's what's so funny,\" she says. \"In my contract, I had the first right of refusal.\" She turned down the second film, she says, because the studio wanted to rush it out. \"I do not regret it at all, thank the Lord,\" she says. \"The truth is I liked the first book the best.\" Hardwicke went on to direct \"Red Riding Hood\" for Summit.\n\n\nHer following film was not a commercial or critical success. Doing an adaptation of the classic fairy tale \"Little Red Riding Hood\", Hardwicke makes this a coming of age story, exploring the theme of adolescence growing into adulthood and sexual awakening. As in Neil Jordan's 1984 film \"The Company of Wolves\", the wolf is a werewolf who lives as a human among the townspeople. The village becomes turned on itself as everyone is suspect. Gary Oldman arrives to help solve the mystery. Red Riding Hood is played by young actress Amanda Seyfried, with supporting roles from Max Irons and Shiloh Fernandez as the love interests.\n\n\nHardwicke's next feature came in 2013 when she directed the erotic thriller \"Plush\". Following a young female rock musician and her band Plush, the film starred Emily Browning, Cam Gigandet, Xavier Samuel and Frances Fisher.\n\n\nIn 2013 Hardwicke also directed and executive produced the pilot for the CBS hour-long legal drama \"Reckless\" starring Cam Gigandet, Shawn Hatosy, Kim Wayans and Adam Rodriguez. It was ordered to series for the 2013-2014 season on May 12, 2013.\n\n\nHardwicke directed the British-American comedy-drama \"Miss You Already\" in 2015. The film starred Drew Barrymore and Toni Collette as best friends who hit a snag in their friendship when one of them is diagnosed with cancer as the other becomes pregnant for the first time. The film premiered in the Gala Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\nHardwicke directed the American-Mexican action-drama-thriller \"Miss Bala\", a remake of 2011 film of the same name by Gerardo Naranjo. It stars Gina Rodriguez, Ismael Cruz Córdova, Anthony Mackie, Aislinn Derbez, Matt Lauria and Cristina Rodlo. It was released on February 1, 2019, by Columbia Pictures.\n\nA common theme in her movies, specifically \"Thirteen\" and \"Lords of Dogtown\", is teen angst. These movies revolve around the trouble that comes with adolescence and show it in a realistic way. In \"Thirteen\" she shows head on the trials and tribulations that come with growing out of adolescence and into adult hood, and girls becoming women. Her film Lords of Dogtown is an example of the laid-back California lifestyle and fictional account of boys growing up in the streets of Venice. Hardwicke purposely casts young teens from indie films, \"both of Hardwicke's pics (Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown) are marked by the believable performances she elicits from young actors, something she says comes from respecting their creativity and a lot of time spent ‘just hanging out’\".\n\nHardwicke addresses these problems as real ones rather than simply dismissing, \"I care about difficult emotional moments and I want to be there for those moments and not cut away\". Hardwicke takes a close look into the lives of young teens, showing that they too experience raw emotion, pain, and happiness. Rather than focusing on comedy, and the lighter part of being a young teen Hardwicke chooses to show parts of teen life that are often kept hidden. In both movies, these characters have anger and release it not only on themselves but the people around them. She includes examples of teens not being sure of who they are, or where they are going in life. Another thing that Hardwicke focuses on is the power of friendship. Both movies show difficulties of life but how they can be made easier or even more difficult by the friends we have.\n\nHardwicke has worked with many of this generation's tween idols: Evan Rachel Wood (\"Thirteen\"), Emile Hirsch (\"Lords of Dogtown\"), Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner (\"Twilight\"), who each got big breaks in her highly successful films. Hardwicke's films have been considered \"dark\" in story and tone. In 2009, she was awarded the Women in Film Dorothy Arzner Directors Award.\n\nIn 2012, Hardwicke helped create a public service announcement for the National Women's History Museum. Hardwicke came up with the idea for the announcement and contributed to the script.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1834251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834251", "title": "Morteza Motahhari", "text": "Morteza Motahhari\n\nMorteza Motahhari (, also Romanized as “Mortezā Motahharī”; February 3, 1920 – May 1, 1979) was an Iranian Twelver Shia cleric, philosopher, lecturer. Motahhari is considered to have an important influence on the ideologies of the Islamic Republic, among others. He was a co-founder of Hosseiniye Ershad and the Combatant Clergy Association (\"Jāme'e-ye Rowhāniyat-e Mobārez\"). He was a disciple of Ruhollah Khomeini during the Shah's reign and formed the Council of the Islamic Revolution at Khomeini's request. He was chairman of the council at the time of his assassination.\n\nMotahhari was born in Fariman on 3 February 1920. He attended the Hawza of Qom from 1944 to 1952 and then left for Tehran. His grandfather was an eminent religious scholar in Sistan province and since he traveled with his family to Khorasan Province, there is little information about his origin as Sistanian. His father Shaykh Mohammad Hosseini was also an eminent figure in his village, Fariman, who was respected by the people. He was considered as one of the pupils of Akhund Khorasani and besides he was admired by Ayatollah Mara'shi Najafi.\n\nAt the age of 5, Morteza Motahhari went to school without informing his parents. By the age of twelve he learned the preliminary Islamic sciences from his father. He also went to the seminary of Mashhad and studied for two years there in the school of Abd ul-Khan along with his brother. But his studies remained unfinished in Mashhad seminary because of problems faced by his family which obliged him to return to Fariman to help them.\n\nAccording to Motahhari's own account, in this period he could study a great number of historical books. It was in this period that he was confronted with questions on worldview such as the problem of God. He considered Agha Mirza Mahdi Shahid Razavi as an eminent master in rational sciences. He decided to go to Qom in 1315 (Solar Hijri calendar).\n\nHe finally took up residence in the school of Feyzieh in Qom. He studied the books \"Kifayah\" and \"Makaseb\" in Shia jurisprudence under the instruction of Ayatollah Sayyed Mohaqeq Yazdi popularly known as Damad. He also participated in the lectures of Hojjat Kooh Kamarehei and sought knowledge from Sadr al-Din al-Sadr, Mohammad Taqi Khansari, Golpaygani, Ahmad Khansari and Najafi Marashi.\n\nWhen Ayatollah Boroujerdi emigrated to Qom, Motahari could take part in his courses on Principles of Jurisprudence. Ayatollah Montazeri was his classmate in this period.\n\nLater, Motahhari emigrated to Isfahan because of hot climate of Qom. There he became familiar with Haj Ali Agha Shirazi who was the teacher of Nahj al-Balagha in 1320 (Solar Hijri calendar) whom Motahhari always described with honor.\nLater, he joined the University of Tehran, where he taught philosophy for 22 years. Between 1965 and 1973 he also gave regular lectures at the Hosseiniye Ershad in Northern Tehran.\n\nMotahhari wrote several books on Islam, Iran, and historical topics. His emphasis was on teaching rather than writing. However, after his death, some of his students worked on writing down his lectures and publishing them as books. As of the mid-2008, the \"Sadra Publication\" published more than sixty volumes by Motahhari. Nearly 30 books were written about Motahhari or quoted from his speeches.\n\nMorteza Motahhari opposed what he called groups who \"depend on other schools, especially materialistic schools\" but who present these \"foreign ideas with Islamic emblems\". In a June 1977 article he wrote to warn \"all great Islamic authorities\" of the danger of \"these external influential ideas under the pretext and banner of Islam.\" It is thought he was referring to the People's Mujahideen of Iran and the Furqan Group.\n\nMotahhari was the father-in-law of Iran's former secretary of National Security Council Ali Larijani. It was by Motahari's advice that Larijani switched from computer science to Western Philosophy for graduate studies.\n\nA major street in Tehran formerly known as \"Takhte Tavoos\" (Peacock Throne) was renamed after him. Morteza Motahari Street connects Sohrevardi Street and Valiasr Street, two major streets in Tehran.\n\nDuring the struggle with Shah's regime, Morteza Motahhari contributed in creating new Islamic discourses. Besides, he was among those who had discussed the conditions of Marja' after the death of Ayatollah Broujerdi. He wrote the book \"Mutual services of Iran and Islam\" in such a condition. Also his works had an important impact on expanding the movement of religious reform in early days of revolution. His works primarily consisted of traditional Islamic and Shia thoughts. He wrote an essay about revitalization of religious thought in the occasion. Writing the \"need for Candidness in religious leadership\", he aimed to show the youth the attractiveness of Islam.\n\nMorteza Motahhari expressed his opinions in different majors and disciplines such as philosophy, religion, economic, politics and etc. Motahhari and Shariati were counted as two prominent figures during Islamic revolution of Iran. He emphasized on Islamic democracy for suitable political structure.\n\nMotahhari also recognized fitra as the truth of human. According to him, fitra is a permanent and unchangeable quality in human nature. In fact, he believed that fitra played the role of a mediator in God-human beings relation. Also, he believed that Imam was a perfect man who shows the high rank of human spirituality. Imam also is characterized as a religious leader. His lengthy footnote on the “book of principles of philosophy and method of realism” by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i was against the historical Marxism. Also he believed that \"Wali-e faqih\" only had the right of supervisory not governing. He also maintained that the ruling was one of the political aspect of Imam in society. He maintained that there was no conflict between science and religion since he believed that Science qua science had no conflict and challenge with metaphysics. He believed that the quasi-conflict between science and religion was in terms of their language not themselves.\n\nMotahhari also expressed views on development and relevant ideology. According to him, freedom, culture and mental-cultural revolution are principles of development. He also refers to some elements for characterizing a developed society. These factors are independence, knowledge and transcendence. Also, according to Motahhari, development originates from cultural self-reliance, purification of cultural sources and logical and cautious communication with west. Motahhari believed in the development of human resources but he also thought that economy was not an aim but only is a condition for development.\n\nAs outlined by Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari in 1975, the phrase ‘equal rights’ means something different from what is commonly understood by western world. He clarified that men and women were innately different and therefore enjoyed different rights, duties and punishments.\n\nMotahhari believed that the eternality of Islam is provided by \"Fiqh\". He thought that fiqh along with the character of ijtihad could be an important thing for confronting with the problem of different times and places. Using ijtihad, there is no need to a new prophet.\n\nMotahhari defined freedom as nonexistence of obstacles. According to him, obstacles were of two characters. The first one was that obstacle could limit human and besides counted as a something get human not to do something. In simple word, obstacle could has the dignity of limiting and declining humans. The second one is to thing which decline the perception and introspection of subject in terms of knowledge. According to Motahhari, aside from the realization of putting away obstacles we need to give the spirit of freedom. He analyze the concept of freedom as both right and obligation. He believes that the freedom has necessity for human. Human must be free to choose voluntarily his path. He believes that, contrary to liberalists, inborn right has an ultimate for transcending of human beings.\n\nLike other men of thought, Motahhari thinks that we have to define the concepts first of all. Therefore, he defines right as a dominance or score on something. According to right the human is merit to possess something and other human ought to respect him. Some of rights are such as the right of parents on their children or the rights of husband and wife in relation to each other. Motahhari divided the right into two groups. First group is existential rights or takwini and the second is religious rights or tashriei. former is a real relation between person and object and the latter determined according to former. He knew the right as a potential score for persons. In fact the right concerned with the priority of somebody on something. He concerned with the question in that is the right and possession predicated on human as such or predicated on human in terms of being in society? He believes that undoubtedly the right existed prior to society. Contrary to John Austin (legal philosopher), Motahhari believes that there is a mutual relation between right and responsibility (\"Haq va Taklif\"). Motahhari believes that the natural law theory is a rational one that is of importance for human kind. According to him, the foundation of natural theory of law is to world has a goal and aim finally. On the basis of principle of having goal, the God creates the world for the sake of human kind and they have potential right to change the world therefore human kind have right prior to introducing in society.\n\nMotahhari refers to the concept of 'maktab' or school when he intends to define the word of religion. According to him maktab is a thoughtful disciplined system including ideology and View in terms of ethics, politics, economy and civil law and etc. Finally, he defines religion as a collection of knowledge bestowed to human for the sake of guiding him and also religion is a collection of beliefs, moralities and individual and collective judgments. Therefore, he knows religion and its teaching as beliefs, moralities and judgments. Also Motahhari believes that the domain of religion at all is not limited to life but concerned with after afterlife. He believes that Islam as a religion is consistent with life of human and there is no room for denying it.\n\nDariush Shayegan believes that Motahhari confused the Hegelian thought and Stace's quotations in confronting with Hegel. According to Shaygan since each of Motahhari and Hegel belong to different paradigms, there is no common world between them.\n\nHe considered Marxism as a great threat for youths and revolution of Iran therefore he tried to criticize Marxism along with pioneer figures like Ali Shariati. Also his commentary on the book of Mulla Sadra influenced many scholars. Besides, he also emphasized on the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge. Motahhari argued that if someone compares fatwas belong to different jurists and at the same time considers their lives and states of knowledge then it is clear that the presuppositions of jurists and its knowledge affected their knowledge. According to him, because of this reason, we observe that the fatwa belong to Arab has an Arab flavor and the fatwa belong to non-Arab has an Ajam flavor. Also He tried to compare Quran with nature. He also believed that the contemporary interpretations of Quran were considerable than Ancient rendition of Islam because the future generation has a better understanding of Quran and Also a deeper appreciation of it. But At the same Time he doesn’t believe in epistemological pluralism.\n\nBecause of his activities, he was favored by revolutionary people and was hated by anti-revolutionaries group, such as the Islamist Furqan Group. On 1 May 1979 Morteza Motahhari was assassinated in Tehran by gunshot after leaving a late meeting at the house of Yadollah Sahabi. The Furqan Group claimed responsibility for the assassination. The alleged assassin was the group's founder, Akbar Goudarzi.\n\nOn the occasions of Morteza Motahari's death (assassinated by Forqan Group), 12-Ordibehesht (the second month of the Solar Hijri calendar) has been named at the calendar of Islamic Republic of Iran as \"Teachers' Day\". And honoring of \"Teachers' day\" is held annually in Iran for a week.\n\n\nHe \"authored over fifty books, which dealt with theology and philosophy as well as practical issues such as sexual ethics, usury, and insurance\", some of which include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1834283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834283", "title": "Gemlik", "text": "Gemlik\n\nGemlik is a town and center of the Gemlik District of Bursa Province. It is located in the east of the Gulf of Gemlik. It is approximately away from Bursa. In antiquity, Gemlik was the location of the ancient Greek town of Cius.\n\nGemlik is an industrial port and it has a freezone trade center. There are also important industrial establishments in south and west of the harbors. The port of Gemlik is one of the busiest import harbors in Turkey. Gemlik is renowned for black olives.\n\nIn the Ottoman-era, the town began to be called Gemilik (Eng. shipyard), because there was a shipyard in the town to build Galleons for the Ottoman Navy.\n\nAs of 1920, the British were calling Gemlik, Geumlek in publications.\n\nGemlik was the site of the ancient Greek city of Cius (; Greek: Kίος or Κῖος \"Kios\"), later renamed Prusias on the Sea (; Latin: \"Prusias ad Mare\") after king Prusias I of Bithynia, was an ancient Greek city bordering the Propontis (now known as the Sea of Marmara), in Bithynia and formerly in Mysia (in modern northwestern Turkey), and had a long history, being mentioned by Herodotus, Xenophon, Aristotle, Strabo and Apollonius Rhodius. It was strategically placed at the head of a gulf in the Propontis, called the gulf of Cius, or \"Cianus Sinus\". Herodotus calls it Cius of Mysia; and also Xenophon, from which it appears that Mysia, even in Xenophon's time, extended at least as far east as the head of the gulf of Cius. Pliny the Elder reports that Cius was a Milesian colony. It was at the foot of Mount Arganthonius, and there was a myth that Hylas, one of the companions of Heracles on the voyage to Colchis, was carried off by the nymphs when he went to get water here; and also that Cius, another companion of Heracles, on his return from Colchis, stayed here and founded the city, to which he gave his name. Pliny mentions a river Hylas and a river Cius here, one of which reminds us of the name of the youth who was stolen by the nymphs, and the other of the mythical founder. The Cius may be the channel by which the lake Ascania discharges its waters into the gulf of Cius; though Pliny speaks of the \"Ascanium flumen\" as flowing into the gulf, and we must assume that he gives this name to the channel which connects the lake and the sea. If the river Cius is not identical with this channel, it must be a small stream near Cius. As Ptolemy speaks of the outlets of the Ascanius, it has been conjectured that there may have been two, and that they may be the Hylas and Cius of Pliny; but the plural ἐκβολαί does not necessarily mean more than a single mouth; and Pliny certainly says that the Ascanius flows into the gulf. However, his geography is a constant cause of difficulty. The position of Cius made it the port for the inland parts, and it became a place of much commercial importance. Pomponius Mela calls it the most convenient emporium of Phrygia, which was at no great distance from it.\n\nCius was taken by the Persians, after the burning of Sardis, in 499 BCE. It joined the Aetolian League, and was destroyed by Philip V of Macedon in the Second Macedonian War (200–197 BCE), and given by him to Prusias I of Bithynia. Prusias, who had assisted Philip in ruining Cius, restored it under the name of Prusias (Προυσιάς). It was sometimes called Prusias ἐπιθαλασσίη, or \"on the sea,\" to distinguish it from other towns of the same name, or πρὸς θάλασσαν. In the text of Memnon the reading is \"Cierus\"; but Memnon, both in this and other passages, has confounded Cius and Cierus. But it is remarked that Cius must either have still existed by the side of the new city, or must have recovered its old name; for Pliny mentions Cius, and also Mela, Zosimus, and writers of a still later date. It was an important chain in the ancient Silk Road and became known as a wealthy town.\n\nThere are coins of Cius, with the legend Κιανων, belonging to the Roman imperial period; and there are coins of Prusias with the epigraph, Προυσιεων των προς θαλασσαν.\n\nCius became an early Christian bishopric. Its bishop, Cyrillus, took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and Theosebius attended the Council of Ephesus. The names of many of his successors in the first millennium are known from extant contemporary documents. At first a suffragan of Nicomedia, it soon became an autocephalous archdiocese, being listed as such in \"Notitiae Episcopatuum\" from the 7th century onward. No longer a residential bishopric, Cius is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nIn 1891, there were 5147 people lived in town center including; 4620 Greeks, 242 Turks, 178 foreigner and 107 Armenian. As of 1920, Gemlik was estimated to have a population of 5,000 (. At that time, it had a naval yard that was no longer in use. On 11 September 1922, Gemlik's remaining Greek citizens left Gemlik to Greece due to population exchange between Turkey and Greece.\n\nGemlik was built on a plain which is bordered on three sides by mountains, with the Samanli Mountains lying from southeast to the northwest. There is a large plain spanning much of the east end of Gemlik to the coast. Karsak Stream, which originates at İznik Lake, divides this plain and town center into two parts.\n\nThe Gulf of Gemlik, often called fig port of Kilyos (in reference to the ancient name of the town), is 35 km from east to west, 10–15 km from north to south, and 100–150 meters deep. For many years, this gulf had been used for docking ships, but now it serves as a tourist attraction.\n\nThe largest river in the area is Karsak, gurgles from İznik Lake and spilles to Gulf of Gemlik.\n\nIn rural areas of Gemlik District mostly covered by Olive trees and Pines on the Samanlı Mountains.\n\nGemlik is a coastal town and it has mediterranean climate (warm and rainy in winter, hot and dry in summer). \nThe driest month of Gemlik district is July with 22 mm of rainfall. With an average of 98 mm of precipitation, the most precipitation occurs in December.\nAlthough the Mediterranean climate generally prevails in the district of Gemlik, the transition to the Black Sea climate shows the view. Temperature ranges between + 42.6 °C and −25.7 °C. The amount of precipitation is between 456.2 mm and 1217.4 mm. The average 113 days of the year are rainy.\nThe warmest month of the year is July, with a temperature of 23.3 in Gemlik. In January, the average temperature is 5.8 °C.\n\n\nKumla is one of the busiest resorts in Marmara in summer period. Especially people from Istanbul prefer to take their holidays in Kumla because it is one of the nearest resorts to Istanbul. There are also smaller resorts like Büyükkumla, Karacaali and Narlı along the north coast of the gulf. Road to these resorts split from Yalova-Bursa state road to Gemlik beltway through Kumla. Sudüşen waterfall is in the north of the village of Haydariye. There is also a moto-cross tournament organised at Şahintepe point on the Samanlı Mountains and Olive Festival at city in August–September.\n\nIndustrial establishments that produce plastic, textile, marble, chemistry, machinery, automotive, steel and fertilizers continue their activities in the district. Large-scale industrial facilities in Gemlik are concentrated on the western coastline of the district, especially in and around the free zone.            \n\n80% of the population living in the district center is engaged in trade. Salt olive, oil, soap trade is the leading. Olive production has an important place in Gemlik industry.            \n\nTurkey's first cannery Rifat Minaret Koller. Sti. In parallel with the establishment of canning, vegetable growing has developed. Bean, artichoke, cucumber, tomato, pea, eggplant, pepper are the leading vegetables grown.\n\nA significant portion of the economic revenues are from the agriculture and industry sectors. Olive production; Although it has a large share in terms of the area it covers, it has a high share in terms of economic input it provides in agricultural production. The production is not only consumed in domestic markets, but also exports. There are 2 small industrial sites in the district. 664 workplaces operate in industrial sites. There are also 1 free zone and 2 small industrial sites in Gemlik.

{"id": "1834290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834290", "title": "Amleto Vespa", "text": "Amleto Vespa\n\nAmleto Vespa (10 April 1884 – between 1941 and 1944) was an Italian mercenary and secret agent of Italian origin, who worked in Manchuria from 1922 to 1940, first for a local warlord, and then for the Empire of Japan. A self-proclaimed fascist and an admirer of Benito Mussolini, Vespa had no admiration for the Japanese administration of Manchukuo, which he described with considerable venom in a book published in 1938.\n\nVespa was born in the town of L'Aquila, Abruzzo, as the youngest of five children of Alessandro Vespa, a civil servant and Ginevra Concetta de Chellis, a teacher. Little is known of his early life, aside from what he subsequently wrote in his autobiography, in which he claims to have been born in 1888 to a poor farmer's family, left the Italian countryside in 1910 to fight in the Mexican Revolution against Emiliano Zapata, had been involved in various political intrigues in Eastern Europe and to have married a Polish Countess. He also claimed to have traveled extensively in the United States, Australia, French Indochina and in Mongolia. His Italian military service record however shows that he was born in L'Aquila in 1884 and there are no traces in the Mexican archives of an Italian in the front line alongside Madero. Letters to his brother indicate that he left Italy in 1908 for San Francisco and in 1911 traveled to Vladivostok, where he joined the Allied Expeditionary Forces intelligence services. He met his wife Jeannine (Nina for short) in Vladivostok, where she and her mother, as Russian aristocrats, had fled after the 1917 revolution. \n\nVespa and his wife moved across the Chinese border to Harbin in 1920, and worked for Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin until Zhang's assassination in 1928. The Italian consulate in Tianjin had arrest and deportation orders issued for Vespa, who was accused of smuggling weapons and dealing in drugs on behalf of Zhang. To avoid arrest and deportation, he managed to obtain Chinese citizenship in 1924.\n\nAfter the Manchurian Incident of 1931, Vespa fled Harbin just ahead of the \"Kempeitai\" secret police. His family was captured and eventually freed after Vespa agreed to work for the new Japanese rulers of Manchuria under the name \"Commander Feng\".\n\nThrough an Australian reporter, Vespa published an account of his life in Manchukuo in a sensationalist book intended for mass audiences in 1938: \"Secret Agent of Japan: A Handbook to Japanese Imperialism\". According to Vespa, he began to meet with the chief of the Japanese secret service in Manchukuo, a \"Japanese Prince\" whose name was unknown to him. According to conversations with his Japanese superiors, Vespa reports that the Japanese wanted the colony of Manchukuo to be financially self-supporting. Vespa was instructed to compile reports on wealthy members of Harbin's Jewish community, White Russian and other foreign and Chinese residents. He was also instructed to recruit bandit forces to sabotage the China Far East Railway, which was run by the Soviet government. \n\nVespa claimed that the Japanese sold monopolies in gambling, prostitution and opium to racketeers to help pay for the conquest of China. In Harbin alone, Vespa counted 172 brothels, 56 opium dens and 194 stores selling narcotics. However, the situation was confused because there were five distinct Japanese security organizations in Manchuria, often at odds with each other, and individual officers sometimes kept for themselves money that was intended to pay for Japanese arms. Vespa sold protection to other racketeers and organized gang raids against rivals of the monopolies. \n\nVespa mentions that the areas under opium poppy cultivation increased rapidly after 1932, and that from 1937, opium was sent to China, under the guise of military materiels for the Imperial Japanese Army. In localities with no Japanese military detachments, shipments were sent to Japanese consulates. Imperial Japanese Navy vessels transported drugs to towns and cities along China's coastlines and Japanese patrol boats did the same on China's principal rivers. Vespa supposed that these shipments were meant to demoralize enemy troops and reduce their combat effectiveness.\n\nVespa also reported that many monopolies were awarded to ethnic Koreans. These monopolies included chimney sweeping and supplying Manchukuo flags, which were attempts to extort money from the local population.\n\nVespa's book also gives details of the Simon Kaspé kidnapping case. Joseph Kaspe was a prominent Jewish businessman who owned the \"Moderne Hotel\", the principal hotel in Harbin. His son Simon, a French citizen and a pianist from Paris, was kidnapped while visiting Harbin on 23 August 1933. Those directly responsible were said to be a White Russian gang. When foreign diplomatic pressure obliged the Japanese authorities to arrest the kidnappers, the gang executed Simeon Kaspe. Vespa relates the discovery of the mutilated corpse of Simeon Kaspe in November 1933 outside Harbin. Vespa recorded a number of other similar cases.\n\nVespa also reported that Japanese secret agents were instructed to prevent complaints and petitions filed by the local population from reaching the members of the Lytton Commission during their visit. However, despite all these efforts, the Commission nevertheless was able to interview many individuals secretly, and it received many more written submissions which protested against the Japanese authorities.\n\nHis double agency discovered, Vespa managed to take refuge in Shanghai in 1936. His book was published in London in 1938 and had sold very well. He took a trip as a Chinese citizen between Hong Kong and New York in April 1939 under the name Dechellis Vespa and calling himself a journalist. In 1940, he was imprisoned in Shanghai by the Kenpeitai, on accusations of being a spy for the United States, but as an Italian and thus also a citizen of a Japanese ally, he could not be sentenced. Contact with his family ceased after the Pearl Harbor attacks in December 1941.\n\nAmleto and Nina had two children, Italo and Ginevra/Genevieve. After Vespa's disappearance, they moved to the United States. Genevieve joined the League of Nations as an interpreter, while his son became an aeronautical engineer, completely changing his identity.\n\nAfter the war, Genevieve visited the Italian Embassy in Shanghai and was shown documents informing that her father had been taken prisoner by the Japanese, who took him to Taiwan and executed him there or perhaps in the Philippines. However, together with most of the archive, those documents were destroyed in a mysterious fire inside the embassy shortly after.\n\n"}

It is located south of Shanghai and southeast of Hangzhou, the provincial capital. It is bordered by Ningbo to the north, Wenzhou to the south, and Shaoxing, Jinhua, and Lishui to west. In addition to the municipality itself, the prefecture-level city of Taizhou includes 3 districts, 2 county-level cities, and 4 counties.\nAt the 2010 census, its population was 5,968,838 inhabitants whom 3,269,304 lived in the built-up (\"or metro\") area made of 3 urban Districts and Wenling City now being largely conurbated.\n\nTaizhou's name is believed to derive from nearby Mount Tiantai.\n\nFive thousand years ago, the ancestors of the modern inhabitants began to settle in this area. During the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, when the Chinese state was largely confined to the Yellow River basin, the area of present-day Taizhou was part of Dong'ou. Following the 3rd-century  conquests of the Qin Empire, a settlement in the area was known as Huipu Town. It was initially included in the Minzhong Prefecture, but then moved to Kuaiji during the Han.\n\nOn August 22, 1994, Taizhou Municipality was set up in place of Taizhou Prefecture and approved by the State Council. In 1999, Taizhou was approved by the State Council to be a leading city in Zhejiang's urbanization structure and the center of sub zone of the first-class economy. Approved by the National Development and Reform Commission, Taizhou formally became one of the 16 cities of Yangtze River Delta area on Aug.15, 2003.\n\nAt the time of 2010 census, the whole population of Taizhou, including the whole prefecture-level city and subsidiary counties was 5,968,838 with 3,269,304 in the emerging built-up area made of 3 urban districts, Jiaojiang, Huangyan, Luqiao and Wenling City largely being urbanized.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Taizhou currently administers 3 districts, 3 county-level cities and 3 counties.\n\nAt , Taizhou has a long coastline dotted with numerous islands; the largest one is Yuhuan Island in the south. Coastal areas in the east tend to flat, with an occasional hill. Eastern and northern parts of Taizhou are mountainous, with Yandangshan Mountains in the southwest, Kuocang Mountains () in the west, and Mount Tiantai in the northwest. The highest point of Taizhou is Mishailang (), a peak in the Kuocang Mountains, and also the highest point in the east of the Zhejiang Province.\n\nTaizhou has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen \"Cfa\") with four distinctive seasons. Occasionally struck by typhoons in the summers, the climate characterised by hot, humid summers and drier and cold winters with occasional snow. The mean annual temperature is from north to south east coastal area, while mean annual rainfall ranges from .\n\nTaizhou is one of the birthplace of China's private economy in the early days of economic reforms in China. It is the cradle of the Chinese private economy, the name of Taizhou Model is after it. It is the 4th most populous, and the 4th largest industrial prefecture-level city in Zhejiang Province .\n\nChinese automotive manufacturing company Geely was founded in Taizhou which completes its acquisition of Volvo Cars in 2010, is one of China's top ten auto manufacturers.\n\nChinese auto parts manufacturer based Yuanhuan was one of China auto parts manufacturer based,here can produce all auto parts for vehicles.\n\nThe largest HVAC fan company Yilida is also located in Taizhou. It is listed on Shenzhen Stock Exchange (Stock #002686) and has acquired Fulihua fan company in Suzhou in 2012.\n\nTaizhou is also one of the most important Mandarin, Loquat, Wendan(A kind of Pomelo), Myrica rubra producers in China. Other agricultural product including Rice, Canola, edible Wild rice stems or Zizania latifolia, Eddoe, Water chestnut, Bamboo\n\nHistorically, Taizhou was relatively inaccessible by road. This has changed due to large infrastructure restructuring in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Presently, Taizhou is served by the (), which is a segment in the north–south G15 Shenyang–Haikou Expressway, linking the city with Ningbo, Shanghai in the north and Wenzhou in the south; the Shangsan Expressway links Taizhou with the provincial capital Hangzhou. Taizhou Airport was once named Huangyan Luqiao Airport (IATA:HYN) in the city's Luqiao District serves daily flights to Beijing and Chengdu and regular flights to other major Chinese cities.\n\nIn September 2009, the high-speed rail line, Ningbo–Taizhou–Wenzhou railway, opened. There are several stations in the prefecture boundaries of Taizhou. The station serving the urban core is in Huangyan District and is called Taizhou railway station.\n\nIn August 2016 it was announced a second Taizhou train station will be constructed. The line will connect Jiaojiang district to Hangzhou in just 60 minutes with the journey to Shanghai being cut to just two hours\n\nLike the majority of areas in Zhejiang, most people from Taizhou speak a dialect of Wu Chinese, known as Huangyan Hua. It is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin Chinese, and only partially intelligible with Shanghainese. There is also a small portion of Min Nan and Wenzhou dialect speakers in the southern regions. None of these three languages are mutually intelligible amongst each other, but the linguistic diversity of some regions has resulted in a segment of the population becoming fluent in speaking up to four languages, when Mandarin is included.\n\nThe city's people are reputed to be industrious and business-minded, although not to the same degree as neighboring Wenzhou. Many people from the area have migrated abroad after economic reforms began in China in 1978. The city's seafood is of note.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guoqing Temple where the Tiantai (), an important school of Buddhism in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam originates, is located here. In Japan the school is known as \"Tendai\", and in Korea it is known as \"Cheontae\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1834314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834314", "title": "The Shadows", "text": "The Shadows\n\nThe Shadows (originally known as the Drifters) were an English instrumental rock group. They were Cliff Richard's backing band from 1958 to 1968 and on numerous reunion tours. The Shadows have placed 69 UK charted singles from the 1950s to the 2000s, 35 credited to the Shadows and 34 to Cliff Richard and the Shadows. The group, who were in the forefront of the UK beat-group boom, were the first backing band to emerge as stars. As pioneers of the four-member instrumental format, the band consisted of lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums. Their range covers pop, rock, surf rock and ballads with a jazz influence.\n\nThe core members from 1958 to 2015 were Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch. Along with the \nFender guitar, another cornerstone of the Shadows sound was the Vox amplifier. The Shadows, with Cliff Richard, dominated British popular music in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the years before the Beatles. The Shadows' number one hits included \"Apache\", \"Kon-Tiki\", \"Wonderful Land\", \"Foot Tapper\" and \"Dance On!\". They disbanded in 1968, but reunited in the 1970s for further commercial success.\n\nThe Shadows are the fourth most successful act in the UK singles chart, behind Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and Cliff Richard. The Shadows and Cliff Richard & the Shadows each have had four No. 1 selling EPs.\n\nFormed as a backing band for Cliff Richard under the name The Drifters, the original members were founder Ken Pavey (born 1932), Terry Smart on drums (1942), Norman Mitham on guitar (1941), Ian Samwell on guitar and Harry Webb (before he became Cliff Richard) on guitar and vocals. They had no bass player. Samwell wrote the first hit, \"Move It\", often mistakenly attributed to \"Cliff Richard and the Shadows\". Initially, Norrie Paramor wanted to record using only studio musicians but after persuasion he allowed Smart and Samwell to play as well. Two session players, guitarist Ernie Shear and bassist Frank Clark, played on the \"Move It/Schoolboy Crush\" single on Paramor's insistence to ensure a strong sound. In his memoirs, Welch regrets that he and Marvin could not be at the start of making history with \"Move It\".\n\nThe Drifters signed for Jack Good's \"Oh Boy!\" television series. Paramor of EMI signed Richard, and asked Johnny Foster to recruit a better guitarist. Foster went to Soho's 2i's coffee bar, known for musical talent performing there, particularly in skiffle, in search of guitarist Tony Sheridan. Sheridan was not there but Foster's attention was caught by Marvin, who played guitar well and had Buddy Holly-style glasses.\nIn spring the same year, the owner of the United States vocal group The Drifters threatened legal action after the release and immediate withdrawal of \"Feelin Fine\" in the US. The second single, \"Jet Black\", was released in the States as by The Four Jets to avoid further legal aggravation, but a new band name was urgently needed. The name \"The Shadows\" was thought up by Harris (unaware of Bobby Vee's backing group) while he and Marvin were at the Six Bells pub in Ruislip in July 1959. From \"The Story of the Shadows\":\n\nWith a combination of the American situation, Cliff Richard's runaway success (\"Living Doll\" had by now sold over a million copies in Britain alone) and a bit of nudging from Norrie Paramor, we set about finding a permanent name, which arrived out of the blue one summer's day in July 1959 (maybe the 19th). When Hank Marvin and Jet Harris took off on their scooters up to the Six Bells pub at Ruislip, Jet hit upon a name straight away. 'What about the Shadows?' The lad was a genius! So we became the Shadows for the first time on Cliff's sixth single \"Travellin' Light\".\n\nIn 1960, \"Apache\", an instrumental by Jerry Lordan, topped the UK charts for five weeks. Further hits followed, including the number ones \"Kon Tiki\" and \"Wonderful Land\", another Lordan composition with orchestral backing. The Shadows played on further hits as Richard's band.\n\nIn October 1961, Meehan left to be a producer at Decca records. He was replaced by Brian Bennett. In April 1962, Harris was replaced by Brian \"Licorice\" Locking. Bennett and Locking were friends from the 2I's who had been in Marty Wilde's backing group, the Wildcats, who recorded instrumentals as the Krew Kats. This Shadows line-up released seven hit singles, two of which, \"Dance On!\" and \"Foot Tapper\", topped the charts. In October 1963, Locking left to spend more time as a Jehovah's Witness.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris and Meehan teamed up at Decca as an eponymous duo to record another Lordan instrumental, \"Diamonds\". It rose to UK no. 1 in January 1963. Two further hits, \"Scarlett O'Hara\" (also by Lordan) and \"Applejack\", followed in the same year. On the Lordan tunes, Harris played lead using a six-stringed Fender Bass VI. During 1963, the ex-Shadows were competing in the charts with their former bandmates.\n\nThe Shadows had met John Rostill on tour with other bands and had been impressed by his playing, so they invited him to join. This final and longest-lasting line-up was the most innovative as they tried different guitars and developed a wider range of styles and higher musicianship. They produced albums but the chart positions of singles began to ease. The line-up had ten hits, the first and most successful of which was \"The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, the group appeared with Richard in the films \"The Young Ones\", \"Summer Holiday\", \"Wonderful Life\", and \"Finders Keepers\". They also appeared as marionettes in the Gerry Anderson film \"Thunderbirds Are GO\", and starred in a short B-film called \"Rhythm 'n Greens\" which became the basis of a music book and an EP. They appeared in pantomime: \"Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp\" was in 1964 at the London Palladium with Arthur Askey as Widow Twankey, Richard as Aladdin, and the Shadows as Wishee, Washee, Noshee and Poshee; \"Cinderella\" at the Palladium in 1966 featured Richard as Buttons and the Shadows as the Broker's Men. Their film and stage roles allowed the group to develop as songwriters. They wrote only a few songs for the earliest film, 1961's \"The Young Ones\", but by \"Finders Keepers\" in 1966 almost the entire soundtrack was credited to Marvin-Welch-Bennett-Rostill. In 1967, the Shadows used Olivia Newton-John on the track \"The Day I Met Marie\" on their album \"From Hank Bruce Brian and John\".\n\nIn October 1968, Marvin and Welch decided to disband the group following a concert at the London Palladium. In the event, only Welch left, but the Shadows had disbanded by the end of the year.\n\nThe group began 1970 by appearing on the BBC's review of the '60s music scene, \"Pop Go The Sixties\", performing \"Apache\" and backing Richard on \"Bachelor Boy\", broadcast across Europe and BBC1, on 31 December 1969. This was followed by Marvin and a reconstituted Shadows becoming resident guests on Richard's debut TV series for the BBC, \"It's Cliff Richard!\"\n\nThe group were chosen by BBC Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton to perform the Song for Europe in the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest. The Shadows recorded six songs, seen each week on a weekly television show \"It's Lulu\", on BBC1 and hosted by Lulu, a former Eurovision winner. The group taped all six performances in the TV studio before the series itself began, with the video cut into the weekly show. For the presentation of the songs on week seven and the announcement of the result on week eight, the pre-recorded performances were run again.\n\nTwo of the songs (\"No, No Nina\" and \"This House Runs on Sunshine\") were co-written by members of the group. The public voted for \"Let Me Be the One\", composed by Paul Curtis, to go to the Eurovision final in Stockholm in 1975. There, the group came second to the Dutch entry, Teach-In's \"Ding-A-Dong\". Having long stepped out of Richard's shadow, this was a rare excursion into vocals for a band known for instrumentals (although they had cut vocal tracks on most albums, plus some singles 'B' sides, and had four charting vocal singles in the '60s). Welch sang lead and let the world know when, forgetting a couple of words, he turned to colleagues and said \"I knew it\" in range of his microphone. Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in \"The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History\" that they were not a popular choice to represent the UK and the viewers' postal vote was the lowest in 'Song For Europe' history.\n\nIn 1976, EMI released a compilation album from 1962 to 1970: \"Rarities\" with sleeve notes by John Friesen. The first half of the album was from Marvin's solo career and the second was by the Shadows .\n\nFollowing the rare vocal single \"It'll Be Me, Babe\", written and sung by Marvin & Farrar, Farrar amicably left the band that year, moving to the United States to produce Olivia Newton-John. Among her hits, Farrar wrote \"You're the One That I Want\" which was covered by the Shadows in 1979.\n\nThe packaging of hits in \"Twenty Golden Greats\" by EMI in 1977, which led to a number one album prompted the group to re-form once more for a 'Twenty Golden Dates' tour around the UK, featuring Francis Monkman (soon to be in Sky) on keyboards and Alan Jones on bass guitar. Francis left after that tour and the line-up settled as Marvin, Welch and Bennett, supplemented on records and gigs by Cliff Hall (keyboards) and Alan Jones (bass). It was this line-up that reunited with Cliff Richard for two concerts at the London Palladium in March 1978. Highlights of the concert, including four solo Shadows tracks, were released the following year on the top ten charting album \"Thank You Very Much\". On the back of this The Shadows recorded an instrumental version of \"Don't cry for me Argentina\" from the west end production \"Evita\", released as a single at the tail end of 1978. The record eventually reached number 5 in the singles chart thereby giving the group their first top ten single since the 1960s.\n\nIn 1979, their version of \"Cavatina\" also became a top ten hit, and they recorded ten more tracks with bassist Jones and keyboardists Dave Lawson and Alan Hawkshaw for the album \"String of Hits\" on EMI which topped the British album charts. The success of this led to EMI issuing a follow-up album with 13 old tracks (including a Marvin solo track) and one unreleased track from the 'String of Hits' sessions. These tracks came from albums released earlier in the group's career of cover versions of hit singles; this was eventually released as \"Another String of Hot Hits\" in 1980.\n\nAfter 20 successful years together the Shadows and EMI parted company and the group signed a 10-year contract to Polydor Records. The first album released under Polydor was the aptly titled \"Change of Address\" in September 1980. With the influential arrival of keyboardist Cliff Hall, the musical style shifted from the traditional sound, becoming more electronic-based with prominent keyboards and synthesizers burying Welch's contributions.\n\nFor the group's 25th anniversary in 1983, the Shadows released a double album on the Tellydisc label entitled \"Shadows silver Album\" which contained previously released recent material along with new recently recorded tracks. In July 1984 the Shadows reunited with Cliff Richard for a series of celebratory concerts at Wembley Arena and Birmingham NEC.\n\nIn 1986, the Shadows had a top ten hit on the LP chart with 'Moonlight Shadows' a cover album in the same vein as early Polydor releases with singles \"Moonlight Shadow\" and Bruce Springsteen's, \"Dancing in the Dark\" both failing to make a dent in the singles chart. Due to Alan Jones involvement with the Dave Clark's musical \"Time\", the bassist was not available to contribute to the album and Paul Westwood temporarily sat in. \"Moonlight Shadows\" was released on LP and CD simultaneously as the group's third CD release. This top ten album consisted entirely of cover songs. The album spent 16 weeks on chart peaking at number 6.\n\nIn June 1989 the Shadows once more reunited with Cliff to celebrate 30 years in show business where the singer filled London's Wembley Stadium for two nights with a spectacular titled \"The Event\" in front of a combined audience of 144,000 people. As a special surprise for the fans Cliff invited onto the stage original and founding members of the group Jet Harris and Tony Meehan to perform \"Move It\" with him and his band.\n\nOn 30 June 1990, Cliff and the Shadows performed to an estimated 120,000 people at Knebworth Park as part of an all-star concert line-up that also included Paul McCartney, Phil Collins, Elton John and Tears for Fears. The concert in aid of charity was televised around the world and helped to raise $10.5 million for disabled children and young musicians. Brian Bennett resigned from the group just before the group were to embark on what would be their final tour for 14 years with Marvin, Welch and Bennett going their separate ways on 1 December following the final concert in Southampton. The last studio album the Shadows recorded before they split, \"Reflection\", was released in September.\n\nIn December 2004, each of the then-current members of the Shadows was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), but Marvin declined.\n\nThe group re-formed in 2004 for a farewell tour, and recorded \"Life Story\" (written by Lordan) to accompany a hits package of the same name which featured 1980s re-recordings of all their 1960s and 1970s hits. This opportunity to see Marvin, Welch and Bennett, joined on keyboards by Cliff Hall and on bass by Mark Griffiths, was successful enough that they extended the tour to continental Europe in 2005. The line-up was almost the same, except that Warren Bennett, son of Brian, came in on keyboards instead of Hall.\nMarvin, Welch and Bennett appeared together as special guests at Marty Wilde's 50th anniversary concert at the London Palladium on 27 May 2007, performing \"Move It\" with Wilde on vocals. The concert also featured former Shadows Jet Harris and Brian Locking.\n\nOn 11 December 2008, Richard and the Shadows performed at the Royal Variety Performance, at the same time announcing their forthcoming 50th anniversary tour. The tour began in September 2009 with 36 shows throughout the UK and continental Europe, extending in 2010 to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. A new album, \"Reunited\", featuring mostly rerecorded versions of their own hits, reached number four in the UK Albums Chart in 2009. \"Singing the Blues\", the first \"Cliff Richard and the Shadows\" single for 40 years, reached number 40 in the UK Singles Chart, and is Richard's most recent top 40 hit. The Final Tour was put on Blu-ray format by Eagle Records in 2010.\n\nWelch, Bennett, Mark Griffiths and Warren Bennett performed two Shadows hits (\"Apache\" and \"Wonderful Land\") at Albert Lee's 70th birthday concerts at Cadogan Hall, London, on 1 and 2 March 2014, Lee playing with them on lead guitar. The Shadows recorded an interpretation of John Barry's \"The Appointment\" for the 2015 Brian Bennett album \"Shadowing John Barry\". Rumours circled in late 2016 about a reunion and a tour with Richard, but this did not occur.\n\nOn 1 May 2020, BBC4 showed \"The Shadows at Sixty\", a documentary looking back at their success as they celebrated the 60th anniversary of their first No 1 hit, \"Apache\". Marvin, Welch and Bennett all gave interviews and the programme included some previously unseen footage from their early days.\n\nThe Shadows are difficult to categorise because of their stylistic range, which includes pop, rock, surf rock and ballads with a jazz influence. Most tunes are instrumental rock, with a few vocal numbers. Their rhythmic style is primarily on the beat, with little syncopation. They said in 1992 that \"Apache\" set the tone with its surf guitar sound.\n\nThe Shadows and their management did not exploit commercial opportunities such as self-promotion via artwork. They allowed Vox to produce metallic badges in a script typeface, with the group name on the front bottom right corner of all three Vox cabinets sometime during the early 1960s. This badge became the \"default\" band logo but was never commercially exploited by the group.\n\nThe Shadows never used the logo on the front of the bass drum, preferring to allow Meehan and Bennett to use their names instead. Belatedly, the logo was used once on the front artwork of the 1975 original studio album \"Specs Appeal\". As of 2009, the logo still remains untrademarked and uncopyrighted.\n\nIn lieu of a proper band logo, four silhouettes of the original line-up, in ascending order of height, were used as a pseudo-logo on concert programme covers and artwork projects such as sheet music, EP and album covers. From left to right after the drum-kit were Meehan, Harris, Marvin, and Bruce Welch. The original artwork group silhouette was modified each time a member changed: the last version featured Brian Bennett and Rostill in the late 1960s. During the 1970s, EMI dropped the silhouettes, preferring to use three guitar necks or colour photos of the Shadows. During the later 1980s, Polydor used a red Fender Stratocaster (with white scratch plate) as a symbol.\n\nIn 1958, Bruce Welch went to a concert as part of the 1958 Jerry Lee Lewis tour of the UK of which he said:\n\nOn the show was this black American band called the Treniers. Hank Marvin and I were at the back, and we were really impressed at the way the saxophone players moved in unison, taken, I suppose, from the Glenn Miller days. It looked fantastic and we thought, \"We must do something like that because it looks so interesting from the front.\"\n\nThe Shadows developed sequences using their bodies and guitars in tempo with the music, such as 'the walk'. It has been copied by other groups as part of their \"Top of the Pops\" performances, notably Mud, the Rubettes, Showaddywaddy and Yellow Dog. 'The walk' is three steps within a 60–60–60-degree triangle, with a reverse right-heel back-kick, with optional can-can finale. This was varied throughout a gig during certain numbers, for example \"FBI\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, rather than play in a static posture during an instrumental number, or using the walk, their live act was refined to include another movement. This featured Marvin, Welch and the bassist moving their guitars in time, or in sequence, with note or chord changes. Occasionally, during other instrumentals, this guitar presentation is re-engineered with Marvin and Welch acting out of sequence or alternating. When the group performed the popular live number \"Shadoogie\" (originally a track on their first LP), Hank and Bruce would walk forward whilst the bass player would walk back - and vice versa.\n\nDuring the late 1950s in the UK, it was a common practice for pop stars to adopt a stage name, and several members of the original Cliff Richard and the Shadows did so: Harry Webb became \"Cliff Richard\", Brian Rankin became \"Hank B. Marvin\", Terence Harris became \"Jet Harris\" and Bruce Cripps became \"Bruce Welch\". Subsequently, the names Cliff Richard and Hank Brian Marvin were confirmed by deed poll.\n\nThe Shadows have been cited as a major influence on some American guitarists and many British, Australian, Canadian and continental European guitarists, including Brian May, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Andy Summers, Ritchie Blackmore, David Gilmour, and Tony Iommi. A tribute album, \"Twang! A Tribute to Hank Marvin & the Shadows\" (Capitol 33928), in October 1996 featured Ritchie Blackmore, Tony Iommi, Peter Green, Randy Bachman, Neil Young, Mark Knopfler, Peter Frampton and others playing Shadows hits.\n\nThe Shadows influenced 1960s Yugoslav beat bands like Bijele Strijele, Crni Biseri, Crveni Koralji, Elipse, Iskre, Roboti, Siluete, Tomi Sovilj i Njegove Siluete and Zlatni Dečaci, all of whom were the pioneers of the Yugoslav rock scene. In the words of Crni Biseri member Vladimir Janković \"Jet\" (who got his nickname after Harris), \"even the Beatles weren't as popular in Belgrade as the Shadows were\". The second episode of \"Rockovnik\", a Serbian 2011 documentary series about the Yugoslav rock scene, deals with the appearance of the Shadows and the influence they had on Yugoslav bands.\n\n\n\nThe Shadows discography\n\n\n"}

The population is 131,264 (2012 census).\nThe city has been governed by mayor Alaaddin Yılmaz (AK Party) since local elections in 2004. It was the site of Ancient Claudiopolis and has also been called Eskihisar (\"old fortress\") (and as such has several Turkish namesakes).\n\nBolu is on the old highway from Istanbul to Ankara, which climbs over Mount Bolu, while the new motorway passes through Mount Bolu Tunnel below the town.\n\nBolu was part of one of the Hittite kingdoms around 2000 BC and later 500 BC became one of the leading cities of the Kingdom of Bithynia (279 BC - 79 BC). Bebryces, Mariandynes, Koukones, Thyns and Paphlagons are native people of the area in antique era. Strabo (XII, 4, 7) mentions a Hellenistic town, Bithynium (), celebrated for its pastures and cheese, which according to Pausanias (VIII, 9) was founded by Arcadians from Mantinea.\n\nIn the Ancient Roman era, as is shown by its coins, the town was commonly called Claudiopolis after Emperor Claudius. It was the birthplace of Antinous, the posthumously deified lover of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who was very generous to the city, and his name was later added to that of Claudius on the coins of the city. Emperor Theodosius II (408-50) made it the capital of a new province, formed out of Bithynia and Paphlagonia, and called by him \"Honorias\" in honour of his younger son and successor Honorius.\n\nThe city was known under Byzantine rule as Hadrianopolis (like many other; not to be confused with Hadrianopolis in Honoriade, also Constanti(n)a, now Viranşehir). Turkmens migrating west settled the city in the 11th century and it was referred to as Boli, Turkicized short for the Greek \"Polis\" 'city'. It was recaptured by Byzantines in 1097 but was conquered by the Great Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in 1197.\n\nIn 1325, the town was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, becoming known under the present Turkish name (sometimes called \"Bolou\" or \"Boli\"). It was also ruled by Candaroğlu between 1402 and 1423. It became the chief town of a sanjak in the vilayet (province) of Kastamonu and had a population of 10,000 inhabitants. In the late 19th and early 20th century, (after 1864 with Vilayetler Nizannamesi) Bolu was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. Bolu was an Ottoman state ( eyalet ) until Vilayetler Nizannamesi 1864 and was covering from Beykoz kazasi of İsmid Sanjak to Boyabat kazasi of Sinop Sanjak.\n\nAs secular capital of the Roman province of Honorias, in the civil Diocese of Pontus, the bishopric of Claudiopolis became the metropolitan see, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, with five suffragan sees : Heraclea Pontica, Prusias ad Hypium, Tium, Cratia and Hadrianopolis in Honoriade. It appears as such in the \"Notitiae Episcopatuum\" of Pseudo-Epiphanius of about 640 and in that of Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise of the early 10th century, ranking sixteenth viz. seventeenth among the Patriarchate's Metropolitans.\nThe city, known as Hadrianopolis (like many other) under Byzantine rule fell to Turkmens migrating west in the 11th century who called it Boli, was recaptured by Byzantines in 1097, besieged unsuccessfully by the Sultanate of Rum in 1177 and reconquered in 1197. Under Ottoman rule since the 14th century it lost to Heraclea Pontica the Metropolitan dignity. It ceased to exist as a residential bishopric in the 15th century.\n\nMichel Lequien mentions twenty bishops of the see to the 13th century; documentary mentions are available for the following incumbent (Arch)bishops :\n\nThe archdiocese was nominally restored by the Catholic Church as a Latin Metropolitan titular archbishopric no later than the seventeenth century, first named Claudiopolis (Latin) / Claudiopoli (Curiate Italian), renamed in 1933 as Claudiopolis in Honoriade (Latin) / Claudiopoli di Onoriade (Italiano) / Claudiopolitan(us) in Honoriade (Latin).\n\nIt has been held by:\n\nThe countryside around Bolu offers excellent walking and other outdoor pursuits. There are hotels in the town. Sights near the town include:\n\nBolu is home to examples of Ottoman architecture. The Grand Mosque dates to 1899, but was originally built by Bayezid I and is home to decorations that resemble embroideries. The Kadı Mosque is perhaps the best example of classical Ottoman architecture in the city, having been built in 1499 and having its entrance embroidered with ornate kündekari works. Other Ottoman mosques in the city include the İmaret Mosque, built in the 16th century, Saraçhane Mosque, built in 1750, Ilıca Mosque, built in 1510–11, Karaköy Cuma Mosque, built in 1562-63 and Tabaklar Mosque, built in 1897.\n\nThe remains of the ancient city of Bithynium have been found in four hills in the city centre, Kargatepe, Hisartepe, Hıdırlıktepe and the Uğurlunaip Hill. In Hıdırlıktepe, a tomb and the remains of a theatre have been uncovered. In Hisartepe, a temple believed to have been built by the Roman emperor Hadrian for his lover Antinous has been excavated. In 1911, it was noted that \"in and around [Bolu] are numerous marbles with Greek inscriptions, chiefly sepulchral, and architectural fragments.\"\n\nBolu Museum was established in 1975 to display and protect artifacts found in the Bolu area. It functions as both an archaeological and an ethnographic museum and is home to 3286 archaeological and 1677 ethnographic artifacts, as well as 12,095 historical coins. The archaeological artifacts chronicle the history of the area from Neolithic to Byzantine eras.\nLocal specialities include a sweet made of hazelnuts (which grow in abundance here) and an eau-de-cologne with the scent of grass. One feature of Bolu dear to the local people is the soft spring water (\"kökez suyu\") obtained from fountains in the town.\n\nBolu is home to 12 local newspapers published in the city centre, two local TV channels (Köroğlu TV and Abant TV), three local radio stations and six local magazines.\n\nBolu is a busy market town rather than a large city. It has one long shopping street and an attractive forested mountain countryside. Students from the university and soldiers based in Bolu make an important contribution to the local economy, which traditionally depended on forestry and handicrafts. Market day is Monday, when people from the surrounding villages come into town for their weekly shop.\n\nThe main road from Istanbul to Ankara used to cross Bolu mountain, although more people would stop at the roadside restaurants than actually come into the town, and anyway now the Mount Bolu Tunnel is open most people will rush by on the motorway rather than climb up into Bolu, especially in winter when the road has often been closed due to ice and snow. Some of the service stations on the mountain road have already announced their closure or moved elsewhere.\n\nBolu has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfb\"), with cold and snowy winters and warm summers with cool nights. Unlike the low-lying, sheltered city center, many parts of the province, like Gerede, have a humid continental climate (\"Dfb\"), due to very cold winters. January mean temperature is 0.7 °C, and temperatures rarely rise more than 12.3 °C and rarely drop below -15.0 °C during winter months. July mean temperature is 19.9 °C and temperatures rarely drop below 8.3 °C and rarely rise up to 32.2 °C in summer months. Lowest temperature recorded is -34 °C (-29.2 °F) in February 1929, and the highest was 39.8 °C (103.6 °F) in August 2006. Record snow thickness was 72 cm (28.3 inches) in February 1950. Bolu is a usually cloudy and foggy city and annual sunshine hours are about to be 1,600.Bolu's climate is similar to Budapest's climate.\n\n"}

The term is not necessarily a diagnosis since it requires an evaluation to determine the cause of the hypoglycemia.\n\nThe condition is related to homeostatic systems used by the body to control the blood sugar level. It is described as a sense of tiredness, lethargy, irritation, or hangover, although the effects can be lessened if a lot of physical activity is undertaken in the first few hours after food consumption.\n\nThe alleged mechanism for the feeling of a crash is correlated with an abnormally rapid rise in blood glucose after eating. This normally leads to insulin secretion (known as an \"insulin spike\"), which in turn initiates rapid glucose uptake by tissues, either storing it as glycogen or using it for energy production. The consequent fall in blood glucose is indicated as the reason for the \"sugar crash\". Another cause might be hysteresis effect of insulin action, i.e., the effect of insulin is still prominent even if both plasma glucose and insulin levels were already low, causing a plasma glucose level eventually much lower than the baseline level.\n\nSugar crashes are not to be confused with the after-effects of consuming large amounts of \"protein\", which produces fatigue akin to a sugar crash, but are instead the result of the body prioritising the digestion of ingested food.\n\nThe prevalence of this condition is difficult to ascertain because a number of stricter or looser definitions have been used. It is recommended that the term reactive hypoglycemia be reserved for the pattern of postprandial hypoglycemia which meets the Whipple criteria (symptoms correspond to measurably low glucose and are relieved by raising the glucose), and that the term idiopathic postprandial syndrome be used for similar patterns of symptoms where abnormally low glucose levels at the time of symptoms cannot be documented.\n\nTo assist in diagnosis, a doctor may order an HbA1c test, which measures the blood sugar average over the two or three months before the test. The more specific 6-hour glucose tolerance test can be used to chart changes in the patient's blood sugar levels before ingestion of a special glucose drink and at regular intervals during the six hours following to see if an unusual rise or drop in blood glucose levels occurs.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) at the time of symptoms followed by relief after eating confirms a diagnosis for reactive hypoglycemia.\n\nSymptoms vary according to individuals' hydration level and sensitivity to the rate and/or magnitude of decline of their blood glucose concentration.\n\nA crash is usually felt within four hours of heavy carbohydrate consumption. Along with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia include:\n\nThe majority of these symptoms, often correlated with feelings of hunger, mimic the effect of inadequate sugar intake as the biology of a crash is similar in itself to the body's response to low blood sugar levels following periods of glucose deficiency.\n\nThe NIH states: \"The causes of most cases of reactive hypoglycemia are still open to debate. Some researchers suggest that certain people may be more sensitive to the body’s normal release of the hormone epinephrine, which causes many of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Others believe deficiencies in glucagon secretion might lead to reactive hypoglycemia.\n\nSeveral other hormones are responsible for modulating the body's response to insulin, including cortisol, growth hormone and sex hormones. Untreated or under-treated hormonal disorders such as adrenal insufficiency (see also Addison's disease) or growth hormone deficiency can therefore sometimes cause insulin hypersensitivity, and reactive hypoglycemia.\n\nStomach bypass surgery or hereditary fructose intolerance are believed to be causes, albeit uncommon, of reactive hypoglycemia. Myo-inositol or 1-\"chiro\"-inositol withdrawal can cause temporary reactive hypoglycemia.\n\nThere are several kinds of reactive hypoglycemia:\n\n\n\"Idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia\" is a term no longer used because researchers now know the underlying causes of reactive hypoglycemia and have the tools to perform the diagnosis and the pathophysiological data explaining the mechanisms.\n\nTo check if there is real hypoglycemia when symptoms occur, neither an oral glucose tolerance test nor a breakfast test is effective; instead, a hyperglucidic breakfast test or ambulatory glucose testing is the current standard.\nThe body requires a relatively constant input of glucose, a sugar produced upon digestion of carbohydrates, for normal functioning. Glucagon and insulin are among the hormones that ensure a normal range of glucose in the human body. Upon consumption of a meal, blood sugar normally rises, which triggers pancreatic cells to produce insulin. This hormone initiates the absorption of the just-digested blood glucose as glycogen into the liver for metabolism or storage, thereby lowering glucose levels in the blood. In contrast, the hormone glucagon is released by the pancreas as a response to lower than normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon initiates uptake of the stored glycogen in the liver into the bloodstream so as to increase glucose levels in the blood.\nSporadic, high-carbohydrate snacks and meals are deemed the specific causes of sugar crashes. The “crash” one feels is due to the rapid increase and subsequent decline of blood sugar in the body system as one begins and ceases consumption of high-sugar foods. More insulin than is actually needed is produced in response to the large, rapid ingestion of sugary foods.\n\nTo relieve reactive hypoglycemia, the NIH recommends taking the following steps:\n\n\nOther tips to prevent sugar crashes include:\n\nLow-carbohydrate diet and/or frequent small meals is the first treatment of this condition. The first important point is to add small meals at the middle of the morning and of the afternoon, when glycemia would start to decrease. If adequate composition of the meal is found, the fall in blood glucose is thus prevented. Patients should avoid rapidly absorbed sugars and thus avoid popular soft drinks rich in glucose or sucrose. They should also be cautious with drinks associating sugar and alcohol, mainly in the fasting state.\nAs it is a short-term ailment, a sugar crash does not usually require medical intervention in most people. The most important factors to consider when addressing this issue are the composition and timing of foods.\n\nAcute low blood sugar symptoms are best treated by consuming small amounts of sweet foods, so as to regain balance in the body's carbohydrate metabolism. Suggestions include sugary foods that are quickly digested, such as:\n\n\nThe anti-hypertensive class of medication known as calcium channel blockers could be useful for reactive hypoglycemia as inhibition of the calcium channels on beta islet cells \ncan help prevent an overproduction of insulin after a meal is eaten.\n\nIf there is no hypoglycemia at the time of the symptoms, this condition is called idiopathic postprandial syndrome. It might be an \"adrenergic postprandial syndrome\" — blood glucose levels are normal, but the symptoms are caused through autonomic adrenergic counterregulation. Often, this syndrome is associated with emotional distress and anxious behaviour of the patient. This is often seen in dysautonomic disorders as well. Dietary recommendations for reactive hypoglycemia can help to relieve symptoms of postprandial syndrome.\n\n\n"}

The reforms created in reaction to the rising violence on the part of Satsuma and other domains; the initial steps taken during this period became a key part of the reforms and changes made during the rule of Emperor Meiji.\n\nWhen the \"shōgun\" and Emperor happened to both die at the same time, the \"bakufu\" (shogunate government) created the Keiō Reform to keep Japan from falling into disunity or disarray. It Westernized many aspects of the system of bureaucracy, the military, and the economy, focusing on governmental promotions by merit (not by birth) and trade policies with other nations.\n\nThe \"bakufu\" hoped that these Reforms would somehow end the Rebellions of Satsuma and Chōshū – that did not happen. The rebels did not wish to see the \"bakufu\" profit from these changes which were so close to the core of what the rebels had been fighting against all along.\n\nThis reform period was preceded by three others during the Edo period: the Kyōhō reforms (1716–1736), the Kansei reforms of the 1790s and the Tenpō reforms (1830–1844).\n\nThe shogunate's interventions had only limited success. In addition to the death of the \"shōgun\" Iemochi and the death of Emperor Kōmei, intervening factors exacerbated some of the conditions which the shogun intended to ameliorate.\n\n"}

It was released in March 1999 as the second single off their album \"Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too\" (1998). Lyrically, the song explores the confusion over why a relationship ended. The group dissolved before the single's release, and as a result the song failed to match the success of the preceding single, \"You Get What You Give\", which had topped the charts in New Zealand and Canada and peaked within the top 5 in the United Kingdom. In contrast, \"Someday We'll Know\" became a top 40 hit only in Brazil where it made Number 38, and failed to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song is the group's final single, and has been covered by numerous artists, including Mandy Moore and Hall & Oates.\n\nThe song is a midtempo ballad in which Alexander reflects on a past relationship and wonders why his girlfriend left him, eventually concluding that someday he'll know the answer. \"Rolling Stone\" called the song \"reflective,\" while Consequence of Sound commented that the song is \"relatable to the ever-been-broken-hearted with lines like 'I’m speeding by the place that I met you for the 97th time tonight' and 'If I could ask God just one question: Why aren’t you here with me tonight?”\n\nThe single failed to match the success of the previous single, due in part to the announcement by lead group member Gregg Alexander that the New Radicals \"[would] no longer be a recording, promoting, or performing entity\" and that he would focus on producing and writing material for other artists, going on to state \"the fatigue of traveling and getting three hours' sleep in a different hotel every night to do boring 'hanging and schmoozing' with radio and retail people is definitely not for me.\" As a result, the song received minimal promotion and was far less successful than its predecessor, \"You Get What You Give\". \"Someday We'll Know\" achieved its highest peak in the US, where it reached number 28 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart on August 7, 1999. The song debuted at number 48 on the UK Singles Chart on the chart dated 25 September 1999, falling to number 76 the following week, which by all classifications means it was never given hit status. The song failed to enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US.\n\nDirected by Lawrence Carroll, the video features the whole band playing the song in a damp warehouse with Gregg Alexander on guitar. It features scenes of people in different places: a laundromat, a bus, a diner, and a pool. In one scene, a lonely woman sits alone stirring her coffee, and the end of the video shows an empty seat at the back of a bus. The group disbanded while the music video was still being produced.\n\n\n\"Someday We'll Know\" has been widely covered. The song was covered by Mandy Moore and Jon Foreman on the \"A Walk to Remember\" soundtrack, by Hall & Oates on their 2003 album \"Do It for Love\" and live by Ronan Keating during his 2002 tour, \"Destination Everywhere\". The Hall & Oates version included a guest appearance by Todd Rundgren on guitar and vocals. An acoustic cover of the song was done by MYMP on their 2011 album \"The Unreleased Acoustic Collection\". A cover of the song was also done by English-American folk rock band America on their 2011 album \"Back Pages\". Sitti covered the song in a bossa nova style on her 2014 album \"Bossa Love\".\n\n"}

Richard is considered by many, such as Louis de Funès and Gérard Depardieu, to be one of the greatest and most talented French comedians in the last 50 years. He is also a film director and occasional singer.\n\nPierre Richard was born in a Bourgeois family from Valenciennes. He is the grandson of Léopold Defays who was the director of the company Escaut-et-Meuse. His name comes from the stage name of Pierre Richard-Willm who was his mother's favorite actor. Pierre Richard spent his childhood and a part of his teenage years in his native city where he was a student at the Henri-Wallon high school.\n\nSkipping classes regularly to go to the cinema, it was Danny Kaye in \"Up in Arms\" that revealed his vocation. This being received with only a moderate enthusiasm by his family, he had to learn a real profession. He then studied kinesiotherapy without renouncing acting.\n\nPierre Richard started his career in the theater with Antoine Bourseiller and producing himself in famous cabarets from Paris, where he played his first sketches written with Victor Lanoux. He then began his film career in 1968 in the film \"Very Happy Alexander\" directed by Yves Robert. In 1970, he directed his first film \"Le Distrait\", followed by \"Les Malheurs d'Alfred\" (1972) and \"I Don't Know Much, But I'll Say Everything\" (1973). He worked again with Yves Robert for the film \"The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe\" (1973) and its sequel \"The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe\" (1974), both written by Francis Veber, who then cast him in the main role in his directorial debut, \"The Toy\" (1976). Their partnership achieved further success in three successful comedies of the early 1980s, \"La Chèvre\" (1981), \"Les Compères\" (1983) and \"Les Fugitifs\" (1986), which paired Richard with Gérard Depardieu. Richard returned behind the camera to direct \"On peut toujours rêver\" (1991) and \"Droit dans le mur\" (1997).\n\nAmong his most famous film roles, Pierre Richard came to play different characters with the same name but without any link between them. He is named :\n\nSince 1986, Pierre Richard has also become a businessman and winemaker. He owns the restaurant \"Au pied de chameau\" in Paris and a 50-hectare vineyard which produces some 80,000 bottles a year (red and rosé) labelled as \"Château Bel Évêque\" in Gruissan in the department of Aude.\n\nMarried and divorced three times, he has two sons who are both actors and musicians, Olivier is a group member of \"Blues trottoir\" and plays the saxophone whereas Christophe plays the double bass. His grandson, Arthur Defays, is a model and actor.\n\nNote : Pierre Richard has played in all the films he has directed.\n\n\n\n"}

The runestones are listed in order of their Rundata catalog listing, chronologically U 999 is the oldest inscription and is followed by U 990 and then the two stones U 937 and U 991.\n\nThe runestone designated as U 937 in the Rundata catalog was found in Uppsala in 1875 in the walls of a Franciscan monastery between the streets of St. Persgatan and Klostergatan, and is currently located at a park in Uppsala University. The fact that its inscription mentions names from the same family as the runestones of Funbo, shows that it was formerly part of the same group. Like many other runestones, it had been used as construction material at a time when the historical significance of the stones was not understood. It is considered to be a good example of runestone style Pr3, which is also known as the Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animals heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. On this stone the runic text lies within a serpent that circles a triquetra, which would have been considered a high status motif.\n\nBecause the runic text of runestones U 937 and U 991 have the same message, it has been suggested that they were once at the same site and formed a coupled memorial to the deceased brother Veðr. They are considered to be the most recent of the four Funbo inscriptions and, although unsigned, are considered to be the work of the runemaster Fot. He is known for his Urnes style inscriptions and for the consistency of his use of the punctuation mark × between words, as shown in the runic text of this runestone.\n\nTransliteration:\n\nOld West Norse transcription:\n\nOld East Norse transcription:\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nRunestone U 990 has its runic text within a serpent that circles a central Christian cross.

The shire covers an area of . The shire existed as a local government entity from 1910 until 2008, when it was amalgamated \nwith the Shire of Maroochy and City of Caloundra to form the Sunshine Coast Region, and again from 1 January 2014, when it was re-established.\n\nThe Noosa area was originally home to several Aboriginal groups. These primarily include the \"Undumbi\" tribe to the south, the \"Dulingbara\" to the north, and the \"Kabi Kabi\" (or \"Gabbi Gabbi\") to the west.\n\n\"Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi, Cabbee, Carbi, Gabi Gabi)\" is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gubbi Gubbi country. The Gubbi Gubbi language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Sunshine Coast Region and Gympie Region, particularly the towns of Caloundra, Noosa Heads, Gympie and extending north towards Maryborough and south to Caboolture\".\"\n\nIn 2003 the Australian Federal Court determined (title claim QC2013/003) that the native title holders for the Noosa area are the Kabi Kabi First Nation.\n\nAlthough much of the culture and presence of the traditional owners of the Noosa district has been lost during the short period of white settlement, there still exist many subtle reminders. These include:\n\nIt is widely accepted that the name Noosa comes from the local Aboriginal word (Noothera or Gnuthuru in the Kabi Kabi language) for shadow or shady place. An 1870 map of Noosa shows the Noosa River written as Nusa River. This has led to an unfounded belief that the word Nusa is derived from the Indonesian word for island.\n\nA Keeping Place of indigenous cultural and sacred objects is maintained at the Noosa Shire Museum, Pomona.\n\nAlthough reports of the area can be traced back to Captain Cook's voyages in May 1770, European settlement in the region did not proceed for almost a century. This early settlement was primarily driven firstly by timber logging and then secondly a gold rush in the Gympie area, north of Noosa. The difficulty of transport in the region, which persisted to the 1920s and beyond, was one major reason for this.\n\nIn 1871, the Government laid out a port at Tewantin, which was duly surveyed and by 1877 contained two hotels, a boarding house, school, police station and telegraph office. In 1872, the Noosa Heads and coastal region south to Peregian Beach was set aside as an Aboriginal Mission, however this was cancelled in 1878 and land was opened for selection on 15 January 1879. With the advent of the railway, Tewantin declined in importance.\n\nNoosa is a region, not a town. It contains beaches and a beach national park, the cleanest river in South-East Queensland and an extensive trail network inland, linking a number of lifestyle villages, including Cooroy and Pomona. In the last 50 years Noosa has been transformed from an isolated fishing village to a tourist destination. Although this has had its costs the shire is known for its generally \"greener\" approach to development. Most development in Noosa has been restrained. Noosa has no high rise buildings, due both to local community pressure and to council planning action, and much remaining native forest. 34.8% of the Noosa district consists of National Parks, Conservation Parks, State Forests, and other generally protected land.\n\nThe popularity of Noosa Heads comes from the fact that is it one of Australia's few North facing beaches located on the East Coast, hence Noosa Beach is relatively protected from on-shore wind and storms.\n\nThe area was originally incorporated as part of the Widgee Divisional Board on 11 November 1879 under the \"Divisional Boards Act 1879\". Noosa was created as a separate shire under the \"Local Authorities Act 1902\" in 1910, with an initial population of 2,000. The first elections were held on 22 April 1910 and resulted in James Duke becoming the first shire chairman. The Noosa Shire Hall was constructed in Pomona in 1911.\n\nOn Saturday 8 September 1917, an Honour Roll was unveiled at the Noosa Shire Hall in Pomona. It was to honour and commemorate those from the district who had left Australia to serve in the armed forces during World War I.\n\nIn the early 1970s, development commenced in the area around Noosa Sound with Queensland Government backing. In December 1980, the Shire headquarters moved to Pelican Street, Tewantin. The former shire hall in Pomona became the Noosa Museum operated by the Cooroora Historical Society.\n\nIn 1982, the Noosa community elected a young and energetic pro-environment and pro-planning Council. The core Councillors who were most influential in this change were elected in a group called The Resident's Team. They laid the foundation for many of the planning and environmental protection concepts for which Noosa is now famous. The 1982-1985 Noosa Council was the first to introduce the idea of a development/population cap, the concept of strategic planning, a focus on community arts, the use of design and landscape controls in development applications and they introduced drafts of many of the first development control plans for each of the Noosa townships. The business lobby supported by several local media personalities were successful in seeing this Council being largely replaced by a pro-development Council in the 1985 election. That pro-development Council was, in turn, largely removed by the Noosa community in the subsequent 1988 election.\nFollowing the election of Noosa's first green mayor, Noel Playford who was an original member of the 1982-1985 Residents Team, in 1988, Noosa's first formal strategic plan was gazetted, and in 1990 development was limited to four storeys. In 1993, a major Council and community complex covering opened at Wallace Park, Noosaville.\n\nIn 1995, the mayor Noel Playford controversially formally announced a \"population cap\" of 56,500 people for Noosa Shire based on the initial concepts developed during the 1982-1985 Council term. The population cap was the expected population under the planning scheme if all available land was developed in accordance with the planning scheme. Noosa had performed the calculations for all land in the shire and provided the results in the strategic planning documents. Noosa was the first Council in Australia to do so.\n\nOn 15 March 2008, under the \"Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007\" passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Noosa merged with the Shire of Maroochy and the City of Caloundra to form the Sunshine Coast Region. Noosa's mayor, Bob Abbot, won the mayoralty of the new Council over Maroochy's Joe Natoli with 70% of the combined vote. The amalgamation occurred despite the 2007 referendum in Noosa Shire by the Australian Electoral Commission where 95% of voters rejected amalgamation.\n\nIn 2012, following a change of state government, a proposal was made to de-amalgamate the Shire of Noosa from the Sunshine Coast Region. On 9 March 2013, 81% of Noosa residents voted to de-amalgamate Noosa from the Sunshine Coast Region. On 18 March 2013, the Sunshine Coast Regional Council decided its new planning scheme should not apply to those areas that were part of the former Noosa Shire (different attitudes to planning and developments having been a major objection by residents of Noosa Shire to the amalgamation). The Shire of Noosa was re-established on 1 January 2014.\n\nOn 2 January 2014 the new councillors and mayor were sworn in with the oath of office; in attendance were Warren Truss, Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and member for Wide Bay as well as David Gibson, Member for Gympie. The ceremony was followed by the first meeting of the council held at the Cooroy Memorial Hall, Cooroy.\n\nThe elected council consists of a mayor and six councillors. Noosa Shire does not have divisional electoral boundaries.\n\nThe Shire of Noosa includes the following settlements:\n\nGreater Noosa:\nCoastal Region:\n\nHinterland:\n - includes part of Great Sandy National Park<br>\n\n\"Directly elected:\"\n\n\"Elected by fellow councillors:\"\n\nThe Noosa Film Festival was held in Noosa between 2 and 8 September in 1999. A number of festivals are also held in Noosa including the Noosa Festival of Surfing.\n\nNoosa Arts Theatre is a flourishing and widely reputed centre for performing arts in the area. As well as various other food and cultural festivals, each year Noosa boasts the Noosa Long Weekend Festival, a 10-day (and night) multi-arts genre cultural festival. Theatre, dance, music, food, film, supper clubs, workshops and more are featured as part of the free and ticketed event program. The event attracts over 10,000 people each year.\n\nThe recently developed The J Centre in Noosa Heads has become another centre for live theatre and musical performances, as well as a secondary campus for the University of the Sunshine Coast.\n\nThe Noosa Country Show is the yearly event established 1909 to showcase the shire's best cattle, horsemen etc. The show is held on the 2nd weekend of every September at the Pomona Showgrounds.\n\nPomona is also home to the Noosa Shire Museum, where European and indigenous history are displayed side by side, and The Majestic Theatre, a performing arts center for the Noosa Northern Hinterland. An art gallery has been established in the old Pomona Railway Station.\n\nThe Shire of Noosa operates libraries in Noosaville and Cooroy. A mobile library service visits the following districts on a weekly schedule: Noosa Heads, Sunrise Beach, Cooran, Federal, Kin Kin, Boreen Point, Peregian Beach and Pomona.\n\n\n"}

Just as the Paris Accords had mandated the withdrawal of all US forces in Vietnam, the Vientiane Treaty called for the removal from Laos of all foreign forces allied to each side.\n\nUnder the terms of the treaty, a new coalition government was to be created; security in major cities (such as Vientiane) was to be undertaken by joint forces from both sides.\n\nThere were no outside guarantees to the terms, as the agreement was only between the Lao factions; the ICC (which had overseen the 1954 Geneva Accords ending the First Indochina War) was more powerless than before to monitor compliance.\n\nThe coalition government envisaged by the treaty did not long outlast it; as with the treaty itself, events in Laos emulated those in Vietnam.

The distance is approximately .\n\nThe ride takes place overnight, hence \"Dynamo\". It is usually scheduled to take place on the Saturday night closest to the full moon in July, partly for tradition but also because it is easier to ride by moonlight. The date for DD20 was moved to 30 June/1 July 2012 to avoid clashing with the Olympics.\n\nThe event was started in 1993 when Patrick Field, of the London School of Cycling, converted an informal ride into an organised event. It was sponsored by Mosquito Bikes of Essex Road, Islington, with some mechanical support and \"controls\" where riders had to check in to stamp an Audax-style “Brevet card”. During this period the ride started from the Eastway cycle circuit rather than London Fields as at present. After about 4 years the ride, which had become very popular, continued on an unsupported 'turn up and go' basis. The controls and support ended, and the organisation of transport back from Dunwich at the end of the ride was arranged by Southwark Cyclists. For many years this was managed by Barry Mason.\n\nThe number of participants has increased every year, to an estimated 1,000 riders in 2009 and 1,500 in 2011. By 2015 over 2,000 participants started the ride.\n\nDue to the increasing numbers of participants the once adequate feeding arrangements have become overwhelmed and a number of \"pop up\" food stands have been introduced, with the blessing of the organisers, to help meet demand. The main feeding stop was moved from the small village hall at Great Waldingfield (approximately out) to Sible Hedingham (about out) in 2010. Due to noise and littering issues Sible Hedingham was withdrawn as a feeding stop and from 2016 onwards the main feeding stop is at the Fire Station in Sudbury ( out) with the profits going towards the Firefighters Charity. \n\nIn 2009, the ride was completed on a penny farthing. In 2011, a rider completed the event on a \"Boris bike\" hired in central London. A team raising money for Re-cycle, Bicycles for Africa completed the 2016 ride on a homemade four-person, four wheeled chopper bike.\n\nThe 2006 ride had 700 participants but was marred by the death of a 38-year-old participant, Andrew Rawling, in a head-on collision with a Ford Transit van in North Weald Bassett. The organisers suggested that the 2007 ride could take the form of a memorial event, but Rawling's family requested that it continue as normal without any dedication, as they did not wish the ride he had enjoyed to become a campaign or protest.\n\nIn 2018, 39-year old Dominic Turner collapsed and died. Turner was a keen cyclist and that helped him to help combat the encroaching effects of muscle-wasting disease Myotonic Dystrophy, but after collapsing outside Great Dunmow fellow cyclists and the emergency services, who performed first aid and CPR at the roadside, were unable to revive him.\n\nThe ride starts at London Fields and passes through Walthamstow, Epping, Moreton, Great Dunmow, Finchingfield, Sudbury, the Waldingfields, Needham Market, Cretingham, Framlingham, Peasenhall and Westleton, ending at Dunwich Beach.\n\nFollowing the popularity of the Dunwich Dynamo, similar rides have been organised elsewhere in the UK: \n\n\n"}

Often religious themes are used to convey a broader message, but others confront the subject head-on—contemplating, for example, how attitudes towards faith might shift in the wake of ever-advancing technological progress, or offering creative scientific explanations for the apparently mystical events related in religious texts (gods as aliens, prophets as time travelers, etc.). As an exploratory medium, science fiction rarely takes religion at face value by simply accepting or rejecting it; when religious themes are presented, they tend to be investigated deeply.\n\nSome science fiction works portray invented religions, either placed into a contemporary Earth society (such as the Earthseed religion in Octavia Butler's \"Parable of the Sower\"), or in the far future (as seen in \"Dune\" by Frank Herbert, with its Orange Catholic Bible). Other works examine the role of existing religions in a futuristic or alternate society. The classic Canticle for Leibowitz explores a world in which Catholicism is one of the few institutions to survive an apocalypse, and chronicles its slow re-achievement of prominence as civilisation returns.\n\nChristian science fiction also exists, sometimes written as allegory for inspirational purposes.\n\nOrson Scott Card has criticized the genre for oversimplifying religion, which he claims is always shown as \"ridiculous and false\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Elizabeth Shaw\": Before that thing ripped your head off, what did he say, David?\n\"David (AI)\": \"Thing;\" Dr. Shaw?

Produced on a budget of , \"Bade Miyan Chote Miyan\" was theatrically released on 16 October 1998 alongside Karan Johar's \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\"; though the latter emerged as the biggest success of the year, it became the second biggest hit in the list and went on to gross over worldwide.\n\nA woman Neha (Ramya Krishnan) witnesses the murder of a friend of her named Madhu (Divya Dutta) by a notorious smuggler Zorawar (Paresh Rawal) but she skips while being chased by Zorawar's goons and ends up in the secure custody of police inspector Arjun Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), a friend of police inspector Pyare Mohan (Govinda). In reality, Neha, unaware of their identities, believes Arjun to be \"Pyare\", about whom she was agreeably apprised of by Madhu, and so, Arjun has to impersonate Pyare, giving rise to hilarious situations. Concurrently, Pyare flirts with Seema (Raveena Tandon) - Arjun's sister. Everything could have been passable for the two cops if two lookalikes of the cops, by the nicknames \"Bade Miyan\" (Amitabh Bachchan) and \"Chote Miyan\" (Govinda) had not been a cause of concern for them because of the misdeeds they commit leading to Arjun and Pyare being accused as the miscreants every time. With background scores of the songs (especially \"Bade Miyan Toh Bade Miyan\") that stir the listeners, the movie advances through scenes of thrill and amusement.\n\nArjun Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) and Pyare Mohan (Govinda) are police inspectors. They share a friendly bond. Arjun's sister, Seema (Raveena Tandon), is in love with Pyare. Arjun has no female companion and some petty comments are made about his age.\n\nZorawar (Paresh Rawal) runs a business smuggling arms and diamonds, under a cover of being a statue maker. Once, in a hotel, he discovers that he is being spied upon and along with the cop spying on him, he gets rid of Madhu (Divya Dutta), an eyewitness.\n\nMadhu's friend, Neha (Ramya Krishnan), witnesses Madhu's murder. Scared, and with the gangsters after her, she calls the police station and asks for Pyare, but since he is not there, Arjun is asked to go to her, and masquerade as Pyare, who had been described as a very good person to Neha by her dead friend. In a considerable amount of confusion, he takes her to Pyare's house and even ges to the extent of asking Pyare to masquerade as Arjun.\n\nTwo petty thieves, Bade Miyan (Amitabh Bachchan) and Chote Miyan (Govinda), who are look-alikes of Arjun and Pyare respectively, arrive in town. Confusion ensue when every crime the crooks commit are blamed on Arjun and Pyare. Things goes further downhill when Shyamlal (Anupam Kher), the police commissioner, is also thrashed by the doubles. Arjun and Pyare are blamed for stealing a diamond from a bank and messing up security operation of Madhuri Dixit (herself). Even Seema and Neha mistake Bade and Chote for Arjun and Pyare.\n\nArjun and Pyare further land in trouble when Zorawar kidnaps Seema and asks for the diamond and Neha in return. Arjun and Pyare, who have been arrested, are saved by the arrival of Bade and Chote, who confuse their acts of theft and conning, and promise to get Neha and Seema back. Bade and Chote arrive at Zorawar's hideout and stall them while Arjun and Pyare come with police force and everyone at the hideout is arrested. The crooks leave after apologising to Neha and Seema for the confusion.\n\nHowever, some of Zorawar's men hijack the police van which is taking Zorawar and his associates to jail. They are stopped on the way by Bade and Chote, asking for a lift. The latter realises who really are in the van and proceed to badly thrash Zorawar and his men and return him to jail. Arjun and Pyare are criticised for their mistake regarding the hijacking of the van and the two crooks are given a job in the police force by the commissioner himself. The film ends with Arjun and Pyare ending up being demoted to the post of traffic police officers and Bade and Chote taking their place as police inspectors.\n\n\nThe songs of the film, composed by Viju Shah with lyrics by Sameer, worked well. Similar to Shah's prior compositions for films like \"Mohra\" and \"Gupt\" that became quite popular, the album noticeably showed his offbeat mode of music yielding the tuneful numbers like the hit title track \"Bade Miyan Chote Miyan\", the hit zippy bhangra number \"Makhna\" and the groovy \"Kisi Disco Mein Jaayein\". Singers Udit Narayan, Sudesh Bhosle, Amit Kumar, Alka Yagnik, Jaspinder Narula, Anuradha Paudwal and Kavita Krishnamurthy allied and rendered their voices for the songs listed below:\n\nThe film's final worldwide collection was .

In an attempt at saving the species, a captive breeding program based on confiscated individuals has been initiated by the Cikananga Wildlife Center in Java (since 2011) and a few European EAZA zoos (since 2015). It has successfully bred at both the Javan and European facilities, and as of 2018 this captive population had reached about 50 individuals.\n"}

Croatia formally declared independence during his term, on 25 June 1991. Following his brief term as Prime Minister, he served as the first Speaker of the Chamber of Counties, the upper house of the Croatian Parliament, from 1993 until 1994.\n\nManolić was born in Kalinovac near Đurđevac. When he was 18, he joined the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ). He was vice president of the Association of Workers' Unions (URS) for the tanning industry. He was accepted into the Communist Party of Croatia when he was 19. In 1940 he was appointed Secretary of the Municipal Committee of SKOJ for Nova Gradiška and was named member of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the World War II in Yugoslavia, Manolić was involved in illegal party activity in Nova Gradiška. He was arrested by the Ustaše authorities in May 1941, along with twelve members of the Communist Party and SKOJ, for multiplying and sharing the Communist Party leaflets. At first, he was imprisoned in Nova Gradiška, but was later transferred to Slavonska Požega. Two of the party members were sentenced to death, but were later pardoned and their sentences were reduced to two and three years in prison, respectively. The rest were released.\n\nAfter his release, Manolić went to Zagreb, where he agitated for the Yugoslav Partisans. He remained in Zagreb until October 1942, when he moved to the territory under the partisan control. As a party agitator, he traveled across Croatia. With dismissal of Andrija Hebrang in 1944, the whole leadership of SKOJ was dismissed as well, including Manolić, who was Organisational Secretary. After his dismissal, the Party sent him to Bjelovar.\n\nIn March 1944, Manolić became Member of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia for Bjelovar, and was later named Organisational Secretary. In October 1944, he was named Director of OZNA 2 in Bjelovar, the communist police founded in May 1944. OZNA 2's jurisdiction were internal affairs, while OZNA 1's jurisdiction was external security and OZNA 3 served within the military.\n\nUnder pressure from the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia, the Yugoslav Partisans left Bjelovar, and returned again on 5 May 1945. His duty, from that point on, was, as Manolić said, to \"clear the terrain from the remaining Ustaše and adversary occupational forces\". His jurisdiction was Municipality of Bjelovar, which then included Koprivnica, Križevci, Đurđevac, Vrbovec, Čazma and Ivanić-Grad.\n\nAfter the war, in spring of 1946, Manolić was dismissed as Chief of OZNA 2 for Bjelovar, and in autumn of the same year, he was sent to be educated at the Military-Political School in Belgrade. The school was organised according to the Soviet model, and was part of the educational system of the Yugoslav People's Army.\n\nAt the end of 1947, Manolić returned to Zagreb, and was named the Chief of the Department for Staff of the State Security Administration of PR Croatia. On 1 August 1948, Manolić was named the Chief of Department for Execution of Criminal Sentences of the Secretariat of Internal Affairs in Zagreb. During that time, he imprisoned Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac. In 1948 he became a chief for prisons for political prisoners and remained in this office until 1963.\n\nIn 1960, Manolić gained a law degree from the Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb. In 1965 he was elected to the Parliament of the Socialist Republic of Croatia. As a Member of Parliament, Manolić was Member of the Constitutional Commission, President of the Legislative-Legal Commission and President of the Organisational-Political Committee. He was reelected as an MP in 1965. In the aftermath of the Croatian Spring in 1972, Manolić was relieved of all duties and sent into retirement.\n\nHe was one of the founders of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), participating at its founding assembly in Jarun, Zagreb. Manolić was Franjo Tuđman's closest associates. Soon, he was named Vice President of the Presidency of the SR Croatia. Between 24 August 1990 and 17 July 1991, he was Prime Minister of Croatia, having succeeded Stjepan Mesić in the post. His Chief of Staff was Tomislav Karamarko, the future chairman of the HDZ and Deputy Prime Minister under Tihomir Orešković. On 25 June 1991, the Croatian Parliament voted for Croatia to secede from SFR Yugoslavia and declared it an independent country. Manolić was succeeded by Franjo Gregurić in July 1991.\n\nWhen Manolić left the office on 17 July 1991 Croatian forces — police and nascent military — were involved in full-scale war with Krajina rebels, who were backed by the Yugoslav federal army. He took another, even more important post as the head of Constitutional Order Protection Office (\"Ured za zaštitu ustavnog poretka\"), a body that would coordinate and supervise all Croatian security services. There he built Tuđman's security apparatus, relying mostly on the old cadre from UDBA and other sections of the Communist-era security apparatus. Despite the nature of his work, he remained very much in the public spotlight. In his interviews and statements he gradually gained a reputation of being a moderate. His enormous power, moderate views and Partisan past made him very unpopular among the rank and file of the HDZ party and brought him into conflict with Gojko Šušak, the powerful Minister of Defence, who led a hard-line nationalist faction.\n\nIn 1993 Manolić was replaced from his post and elected as Speaker of the Chamber of Counties of Croatia (to 1994). Many saw this as his demotion and fall from Tuđman's favor.\n\nOne year later Manolić and Mesić tried to organise a mass defection of HDZ members of Sabor and thus deprive Franjo Tuđman of parliamentary majority. They failed and later, together with other HDZ dissidents, created a new party called Croatian Independent Democrats (HND), of which Manolić was the president in 1995.\n\nManolić's attempt to take power on national level failed, but his supporters in the Zagreb County Assembly succeeded in replacing HDZ administration. This led Tuđman to introduce new legislation, merging Zagreb County and the City of Zagreb and calling for new elections, which ultimately resulted in the Zagreb Crisis. Those elections coincided with the 1995 parliamentary elections, during which HND fared badly, failing to enter Sabor. Since that time, Manolić has been retired from active politics. His autobiography, \"Politika i domovina – Moja borba za suverenu i socijalnu Hrvatsku\" (Politics and homeland - My fight for a sovereign and social Croatia), was published in 2015.\n\nIn 1945, Manolić married his first wife, Marija Eker (1921 – 15 April 2003). On 30 April 2016, Manolić married his second wife, Mirjana Ribarić (born 5 March 1956), who is 36 years his junior. \n\nManolić is the oldest living former Croatian Prime Minister and the longest-lived person to have ever held the office. His advanced age has earned him notoriety both on social media and in the press. Namely, he was found to be one of the oldest holders of a valid driver's license in Croatia and also became allegedly the first Croat to have undergone a sequencing of his genome. There is also a notable satirical Facebook page dedicated to his longevity with the title \"Joža Manolić je nadživio\" (Josip Manolić has outlived). He turned 100 on 22 March 2020.\n\n"}

It forms a superspecies with the Taiwan blue magpie and the red-billed blue magpie. The species ranges across the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent including the lower Himalayas, with a disjunct population in Vietnam.\n\nLength , including tail of about . Sexes alike. Head, neck, and breast black, with a white patch on the nape; remainder of lower plumage white, faintly tinged with lilac; whole upper plumage purplish-blue, brighter on the wings and tail; flight-feathers tipped with white, the outermost edged with the same; tail long and graduated, the feathers blue, broadly tipped with white, all except the very long central pair having a band of black in front of the white\n\nThe yellow-billed blue magpie is found throughout the Himalayas from Hazara to the Brahmaputra. It is divided into two races. Of these, U. f. cucullata is the better known and is found from the Western boundary of the range to Western Nepal, being a common species about most of the hill stations of the Western Himalayas, breeding in a zone from . The typical form is found from Eastern Nepal eastwards and differs in that the under parts have a darker lilac tinge; its zone is slightly higher than that of the Western form, as it seldom occurs as low as . A resident species, but during the winter months it usually deserts the higher parts of its summer zone. \nFrom Simla eastwards, the closely allied red-billed blue magpie (\"Urocissa erythroryncha\") is often found in the same areas as the yellow-billed species; it is particularly common about Mussoorie, Tehri-Garhwal, -Kumaon, and in Nepal, and may be easily distinguished by its red beak and the greater extent of the white nape-patch.\n\nThe blue magpies are, as may be judged from their handsome tails, essentially arboreal birds; though, while they are most usually to be met with in heavy jungle areas, they also venture out into the trees amongst cultivation, and at times on to bare mountain sides at high elevations. They frequently feed on the ground and then adopt a curious hopping gait, with the tail held high to prevent it coming into contact with the ground. They live in parties of seven or eight birds and are very partial to particular localities, so that once a party has taken up its abode in any particular nullah or patch of forest it will generally be found there. They are very active, flying incessantly from bough to bough and not hesitating to launch high into the air when flying from ridge to ridge; a party of these bird crossing a nullah out of gunshot above one's head is a curious sight, with their long tails waving in the air and the light shining through the feathers. The flight is rather slow, laboured, and undulating once the bird comes into the open. The food consists of small mammals, the eggs and young of other birds, insects, and wild fruits and berries of various kinds. This bird is very noisy; the ordinary call is harsh and grating, but it has a wide variety of notes, some of which are melodious enough.\n\nThe nest is built in a fork of a tree, usually of moderate size but with dense foliage, and is difficult to find. It is a rather large and roughly constructed cup of sticks with a lining of fine grass, roots and fibres. The clutch consists of three or four eggs. The base-colour varies from a pale, dingy yellowish-stone colour to a darkish rather reddish-stone colour, and there is very occasionally a faint greenish tinge. The markings consist of small specks, blotches, streaks, and mottlings of various shades of brown, sienna 1 or purple, and they generally tend to collect in a cap or zone about the broad end of the egg.\n"}
{"id": "1834421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834421", "title": "Dave McNally", "text": "Dave McNally\n\nDavid Arthur McNally (October 31, 1942 – December 1, 2002) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher from 1962 through 1975, most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. A three-time All-Star, McNally won 20 or more games for four consecutive seasons from 1968 through 1971. He was one of four 20-game winners for the 1971 Orioles (Pat Dobson, Jim Palmer, and Mike Cuellar were the other three).\n\nBorn in Billings, Montana, McNally was raised by his mother after his father died in the Battle of Okinawa. He was signed by the Orioles out of high school in 1960 and made his major league debut two years later, throwing a shutout in his first game in the major leagues. From 1963 through 1965, he continued to refine his pitches while securing his grip on a starting spot in the Orioles' rotation. In 1966, he made two starts in the World Series, the second of which was a shutout that gave the Orioles a 4–0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. McNally was bothered by a calcium deposit in his elbow in 1967; the injury limited his playing time in the second half of the season. He was named the Comeback Player of the Year in 1968 as he finished second in the American League with 22 wins.\n\nMcNally was selected to the All-Star Game for the first time in 1969, finishing the season with 20 wins. He threw 11 shutout innings to beat the Minnesota Twins in Game 2 of the first AL Championship Series, then faced the New York Mets twice in the World Series. He hit a home run against Jerry Koosman in one of the games, but the Orioles were defeated in five games. In 1970, McNally tied for the AL lead with 24 wins. He hit a grand slam in Game 3 of the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, becoming a World Series victor for the second time as the Orioles won the World Series in five games. He missed six weeks with an injury in 1971 but still pitched enough to be one of four Orioles to win 20 games that season. McNally beat the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 1 of the World Series, lost Game 5, and won Game 6 in relief, but the Orioles were defeated in seven games.\n\nIn 1972, McNally was named to the All-Star Game for the third time. He finished the year with his first losing record since 1964, though this was partly due to the Orioles scoring fewer runs than they had the previous year. In 1973 and 1974, he faced the Oakland Athletics in the playoffs but lost both games he pitched. Thinking he needed a change of scenery, McNally requested a trade after the 1974 season; the Orioles obliged, sending him to the Montreal Expos, with whom he played one final year before retiring halfway through 1975, citing an inability to throw the fastball. After the 1975 season, he added his name to a grievance filed against the reserve clause, which resulted in the historic Seitz decision that created free agency in baseball. McNally returned to his hometown Billings and worked as a car dealer until his death from cancer in 2002. A member of the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame, he is among the franchise's leaders in many statistical categories.\n\nMcNally was born on October 31, 1942, in Billings, Montana. Before his third birthday, his father, James, died in the Battle of Okinawa. Betsy, his widow, worked in a welfare office to support the family; Dave was the youngest of four children. He attended Billings Central Catholic High School, but since the school did not field a baseball team, his baseball experience in his young adult years came with the Billings Royals, an American Legion team. The Royals were in the midst of winning 14 straight state championships when McNally played with them, and the team reached the Legion World Series in two of his years with them. In 1960, McNally had an 18–1 record as a pitcher. Both the Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles Dodgers recruited him; McNally signed with the Orioles a month before his 18th birthday, in September of 1960. He later quipped that, had he known how many young pitching prospects the Orioles had, he would have signed with the Dodgers instead.\n\nThe Orioles had McNally pitch in an instructional league in fall of 1960, then assigned him to the Victoria Rosebuds of the Class AA Texas League in 1961. McNally struggled against the competition, losing three of his four starts and posting a 6.16 earned run average (ERA) before the Orioles reassigned him to the Fox Cities Foxes of the Class B Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League. At Fox Cities, McNally still had a losing record (8–10) but his ERA dropped to 4.18 in 25 games.\n\nWith the Class A Elmira Pioneers of the Eastern League in 1962, McNally was the team's best player. He tied with Wilbur Wood and Sonny Siebert for second in the league with 15 wins (behind Paul Seitz, who had 16), ranked second with 195 strikeouts (behind Bob Heffner with 234), tied John Pregenzer for eighth with 196 innings pitched, tied Bill Hands and Pregenzer for third with four shutouts (behind Steve Dalkowski with six and Richard Slomkowski with five), and had a 3.08 ERA.\n\nFollowing his season with Elmira, McNally was a September callup by the Orioles in 1962; he got one start with the team. On September 26, he pitched the first game of a doubleheader against the Kansas City Athletics. \"I was scared to death,\" McNally later recalled, but he threw a shutout, limiting the Athletics to two hits in nine innings.\n\nIn an interview prior to the start of the 1963 season, Baltimore manager Billy Hitchcock listed McNally among a group of prospects that could provide \"whatever else is needed\" for Baltimore's pitching staff. An injury to Dalkowski helped McNally make the team as a left-handed reliever. After one game out of the bullpen, he made an emergency start for an injured Chuck Estrada on April 20, limiting the Cleveland Indians to one run in a complete game, 7–1 victory. He won his first two starts, but after giving up seven runs and five runs in his next two, respectively, he was moved back to the bullpen, where he was used as a reliever through the beginning of June. Then, Estrada was placed on the disabled list on June 8 due to a bone spur and calcium deposits in his elbow. McNally replaced him in the rotation on June 12 and was used as a starter the rest of the year. He took a no decision on June 12 but held the New York Yankees to two runs (one earned) over innings in a 3–2 loss. On August 22, he threw a complete game against the California Angels, striking out eight while giving up one run in a 5–1 victory. In 29 games (20 starts) his rookie year, McNally had a 7–8 record, a 4.58 ERA, 78 strikeouts, 55 walks, and 133 hits allowed in innings pitched. Following the 1963 season, McNally furthered his development by pitching winter ball in Puerto Rico.\n\nMcNally was used as a starter through most of 1964. On May 12, he threw a shutout and allowed just two hits in a 5–0 victory over the Washington Senators. He also threw a shutout against Kansas City on June 2 in a 4–0 victory. Through August 15, he had a 7–10 record and a 3.89 ERA in 22 games, all but one of which were starts. Thereafter, he was mostly used out of the bullpen, starting just two more games the rest of the year. One of them, the second game of a September 7 doubleheader against Kansas City, was one of the shortest starts of his career; he faced four batters, all of whom scored in the Orioles' 6–1 defeat. In the other, on October 1, he threw a shutout against the Senators, throwing a no-hitter until Don Lock hit a double in the seventh inning. In 30 games (23 starts), he had a 9–11 record, a 3.67 ERA, 88 strikeouts, 51 walks, and 157 hits allowed in innings. His three shutouts tied with five other pitchers for ninth in the American League (AL).\n\nDuring 1965 spring training, the Orioles figured out that McNally's body language was giving away to the hitters which pitch he was going to throw in an at bat. He worked on the problem and had it corrected before the season started. Though he made a few relief appearances throughout the year, he was mainly used as the team's fifth starter. Through the end of May, he had a 4.19 ERA, but he pitched better in the succeeding months. He quit smoking midseason and gained about twenty pounds, which he credited to his improvement, though after the season he would resume smoking again. In the second game of a doubleheader on August 4, he threw a shutout as the Orioles defeated the Angels 8–0. For the second year in a row, he threw a shutout on October 1, limiting Cleveland to two hits in a 2–0 victory in the first game of a doubleheader. McNally topped the 10-win mark for the first time in his career, finishing the season with an 11–6 record. In 35 games (29 starts), he had a 2.85 ERA, 116 strikeouts, 73 walks, and 163 hits allowed in innings.\n\nMcNally held the Yankees to two runs over innings on April 16, 1966, in a 7–2 victory over the Yankees. On July 21, he was one out away from a complete game against the Detroit Tigers, but with the Orioles leading 6–2, Davey Johnson made an error, allowing a third run to score. When Don Wert followed with a run-scoring double, manager Hank Bauer replaced McNally with Eddie Fisher. McNally was credited with allowing four runs (two earned), but he still got the win as the Orioles held on and won 6–4. McNally had a 10–3 record through the end of July, but had an equal amount of wins and losses (three) in the final two months of the season. One of those three wins was a shutout of the Senators on August 6, in a 4–0 victory. Mark Armour of the \"Society for American Baseball Research\" called him \"the team’s most consistent starter\" for 1966. In 34 games (33 starts), he had a 13–6 record, a 3.17 ERA, 158 strikeouts, 64 walks, and 212 hits allowed in 213 innings. As a hitter, he kept his average close to .250 by midseason (uncharacteristically high for a pitcher) and finished the year hitting .195. When asked about his hitting midseason, he said, \"I don’t have to explain my hitting. I mean, did Ted Williams have to explain?\"\n\nThe Orioles won the AL pennant in 1966, earning them a meeting with the defending-champion Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1966 World Series. In the fourth game, McNally and Don Drysdale matched four-hitters; one of Baltimore's hits was Frank Robinson's fourth-inning home run for a 1–0 Oriole victory. \"I had a lot of things going for me that day,\" McNally later said. \"The movement on my fastball was sufficient, and I had a pretty good curveball and changeup.\" His shutout capped a World Series in which Baltimore pitchers set a Fall Classic record by pitching 33⅓ consecutive shutout innings, beginning with Moe Drabowsky's 6⅔ scoreless innings in relief of McNally (Drabowsky entered the game in the third inning and issued a bases-loaded walk that scored Lou Johnson—the Dodgers' second and last run of this Series) in Game One, followed by shutouts from Jim Palmer and Wally Bunker. The trio of McNally, Bunker, and Palmer had pitched one shutout \"total\" during the regular season—that by McNally on August 6 against the Senators. It was the Orioles' first World Series championship since coming to Baltimore in 1954, and a picture of McNally and third baseman Brooks Robinson embracing after their Game 4 triumph remains one of the most iconic Oriole photos.\n\nIn 1967, McNally was the Opening Day starter for Baltimore. He was throwing a shutout against the Angels in the first game of a doubleheader on April 16, 1967, but he allowed two runs in the eighth inning. In the ninth, with the Orioles up 4–2, McNally retired the first two Angel hitters he faced but surrendered the lead when he gave up back-to-back home runs to José Cardenal and Don Mincher. He was removed from the game, and the Orioles lost 5–4 in 10 innings. After losing just six games in 1965 and 1966, McNally had five losses through June 18 of 1967, with a 5.71 ERA to go along with them. In June, doctors discovered a calcium deposit in his left elbow. They treated the injury through draining fluid and injecting cortisone. Following his first cortisone shot, McNally limited the Chicago White Sox to one run and five hits on July 6 in a complete-game, 5–1 victory. One week later, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox, he threw a shutout as the Orioles won 10–0. However, the injury restricted him to four games after July 21. In 24 games (22 starts), he had a 7–7 record, a 4.54 ERA, 70 strikeouts, 39 walks, and 134 hits allowed in 119 innings.\n\nMcNally's first 1968 start did not come until the season's fifth game, but he held the Oakland Athletics to one run in a complete game, 4–1 victory on April 17. Despite a 2.23 ERA, he had an 8–8 record through his first two starts of July when Earl Weaver became the manager of the Orioles; starting Weaver's first game on July 11, he threw a two-hit shutout against the Senators, taking only two hours and 12 minutes to do so. That shutout was the first of 12 straight wins for McNally. He held Detroit to one run over innings on July 20 and hit his first major league home run against Denny McLain (who would win 31 games that year) in the Orioles' 5–3 victory. In the last game of the streak, on September 28, he became a 20-game winner for the first time as the Orioles defeated the White Sox 4–2; McNally pitched the whole game, and the two runs he allowed were unearned. McNally finished the season among the AL leaders with 22 wins (second to McLain's 31), a 1.95 ERA (third behind Luis Tiant's 1.60 and Sam McDowell's 1.81), 202 strikeouts (fifth), five shutouts (tied with George Brunet for seventh), and 273 innings pitched (fourth). He broke Barney Pelty's franchise season record of walks plus hits per innings pitched that had been set in 1906, establishing the new franchise record of 0.852 and leading the AL. At the plate, McNally hit three home runs during the 1968 season; he would hit at least one each of the following seasons until the AL adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973. For his successful return from injury, McNally won the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award. He finished fifth in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting and was named Baltimore's MVP.\n\nAfter winning the last two decisions of the 1968 season, McNally opened 1969 with a record; his first loss of the season came when he allowed a grand slam to Rich Reese in a loss to the Minnesota Twins on August 3, and he ended the regular season with a record. His 17 straight wins were an AL record at the time, and his 15 consecutive wins to open the season tied an AL record. He threw a four-hit shutout in a 9–0 victory over the Senators on April 12. On May 5, he had a no-hitter going until one out in the ninth inning, when Cesar Tovar singled; McNally got Rod Carew to hit into a double play to preserve the shutout. He threw back-to-back shutouts against the White Sox on June 15 and the Senators on June 19. He was named to the All-Star Game for the first time in his career. Though his record was only 5–7 in the season's final two months, he returned to the playoffs as the Orioles won the AL East. McNally's 20 wins tied Mel Stottlemyre and Dave Boswell for third in the league behind McLain's 24 and teammate Mike Cuellar's 23, his four shutouts tied with five other pitchers for fourth in the league, his 166 strikeouts ranked ninth, and he was second to McLain with 40 starts. He finished 13th in AL MVP voting and ranked fourth in AL Cy Young Award voting.\n\nIn the postseason, the Orioles faced the Twins in the newly created best-of-five AL Championship Series, the winner of which would play in the World Series. McNally threw nine shutout innings in Game 2, limiting the Twins to three hits, but the Orioles were unable to score, and the game continued. Still on the mound, McNally threw a hitless 10th inning. With two outs in the top of the eleventh, he walked Harmon Killebrew and Tony Oliva to put a runner in scoring position before getting Bob Allison to line out to Don Buford in left field. Curt Motton finally drove in a run in the bottom of the inning, and the Orioles prevailed 1–0. McNally's shutout is the longest by a pitcher in the postseason, and Will Leitch of \"MLB.com\" called the game the Orioles' most exciting playoff victory in 2018. The Orioles faced the New York Mets in the 1969 World Series. In Game 2, the Orioles and Mets were tied at one in the ninth when McNally, with two outs, gave up three singles in a row to give the Mets a 2–1 lead. The two runs were all he allowed in the ballgame, but the Mets prevailed 2–1. He hit a two-run home run against Jerry Koosman in Game 5 and left the game after seven innings with the score tied at three. However, the Orioles lost the game 5–3, and the Mets won the World Series in five games.\n\nMcNally hit a home run against Tom Murphy on June 9, 1970, and held the Angels to three runs over seven innings, but the bullpen gave up some additional runs as the Orioles lost 7–5. On June 21, McNally pitched into the ninth inning before being replaced by Pete Richert, limited Washington to two runs, and won his 100th career game as the Orioles defeated the Senators 4–2. He made the All-Star team for the second year in a row, picked by Weaver, who was managing the team. McNally had a 12–7 record and a 4.38 ERA on July 18, but he posted a 1.96 ERA for the remainder of the season and went 12–2, with the Orioles winning 14 of the 17 games he appeared in thereafter. From July 26 through August 29, he won nine consecutive games. On August 21, 1970, McNally threw a shutout in a 5–0 victory over the Angels. Four days later, he allowed 10 hits in a complete game against the Athletics, but only one run, and he picked up his 20th win of the season as Baltimore defeated Oakland by a score of 5–1. On August 29, he gave up only one run in a complete game, 6–1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers; the run was unearned. During the 1970 season, the Orioles never lost more than two straight games in which Palmer, Cuellar, and McNally started. The two times they lost two games in a row, it was McNally who ended the streak. McNally's 24 wins at the end of the year tied with teammate Cuellar and Jim Perry for the AL lead. McNally ranked seventh with 185 strikeouts, tied with four others for the lead with 40 starts, and ranked fourth with 296 innings pitched. After the season, he finished second to Jim Perry in AL Cy Young Award voting and ranked 16th in AL MVP voting.\n\nFor the second year in a row in 1970, the Orioles faced the Twins in the ALCS. Starting Game 2 for the Orioles, McNally held the Twins hitless for the first three innings as the Orioles scored three runs. In the fourth inning, McNally made the score 4–0 with an RBI single against Tom Hall. After walking Leo Cárdenas to lead off the bottom of the inning, he allowed back-to-back home runs to Killebrew and Oliva to make it 4–3. McNally never let the Twins score again, and the Orioles cruised to an 11–3 victory before ultimately sweeping the ALCS. This year in the World Series, the Orioles faced the Cincinnati Reds. Starting Game 3 of the series, McNally gave up a run in the second inning but held the Reds to just that through the first six innings of the game; meanwhile, Baltimore gave him for runs of support. After Tony Cloninger of the Reds walked Paul Blair with one out in the sixth, Cloninger was replaced with Wayne Granger, who allowed a double to Brooks Robinson and intentionally walked Davey Johnson before striking out Andy Etchebarren, bringing McNally to the plate with the bases loaded and two outs. McNally helped his own cause, depositing a pitch from Granger in the left field seats and becoming the only pitcher in major league history to hit a grand slam in a World Series. He went on to allow two more runs, but the Orioles led by more than enough in their 9–3 victory. After losing Game 4, the Orioles defeated the Reds in Game 5, making McNally a World Series champion for the second time in his career. The bat McNally hit the grand slam with (lent to him by Motton) is at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\n\nEntering the 1971 season, the Orioles raised McNally's salary to $85,000. He held the Senators to two runs on Opening Day (April 7) in a complete-game, 3–2 victory. On April 23, he and Clyde Wright of the California Angels held each other's teams to two runs until the ninth, when the Orioles scored six times to give McNally an 8–2 victory. On September 7, he limited Cleveland to one run over nine innings and hit a two-run home run against McDowell in a 3–1 victory. A sore arm kept McNally from pitching for six weeks in July and August, but he was still the first Oriole to win 20 games when he threw a shutout against the Yankees on September 21. McNally was one of four 20-game winners for the 1971 Orioles (Pat Dobson, Palmer, and Mike Cuellar were the other three). They were the first quartet of pitchers to each win 20 games for the same team since four members of the 1920 Chicago White Sox each won 20. McNally led the Orioles with 21 wins, tying with Catfish Hunter for fourth in the AL; his 2.89 ERA ranked seventh; and he led the AL with a .808 winning percentage. In 30 starts, his record was 21–5, and he struck out 91 batters in innings. He finished 4th in AL Cy Young Award voting and 11th in AL MVP balloting.\n\nThe Orioles won the AL East for the third straight year in 1971 and faced the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS. Used as the Game 1 starter, McNally gave up three runs over seven innings, saying after the game he didn't have his best stuff. However, Baltimore scored four runs in the seventh inning to rally from a 3–1 deficit, giving McNally the win in a 5–3 victory. After sweeping Oakland, the Orioles faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1971 World Series. McNally again started Game 1, prompting Pirates' manager Danny Murtaugh to bench Richie Hebner and Al Oliver (left-handed batters) in favor of Jose Pagan and Gene Clines (less productive right-handed batters). In the second inning, errors by Mark Belanger and Elrod Hendricks led to three unearned runs scoring for Pittsburgh. However, McNally would not allow any other runs, limiting Pittsburgh to three hits and retiring 19 straight hitters at one point in a complete game, 5–3 victory for Baltimore. He was less effective in Game 5, allowing four runs (three earned) in four innings as the Orioles lost 4–0. In Game 6, with the score tied 2–2 and two outs in the 10th inning, he entered the game, walked Willie Stargell to load the bases, then retired Oliver on a fly ball to keep the game tied. Brooks Robinson hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the inning; McNally earned the win as the Orioles prevailed 3–2. He was brought in to face Stargell with two runners on base in Game 7, but McNally got Stargell to ground out to end the inning; however, the Orioles lost that game 2–1, as the Pirates won the series in seven games.\n\nIn 1972, the Orioles raised McNally's salary once again, this time to $105,000. In the Orioles' second game of the year on April 17, he threw a shutout in a 4–0 victory over the Yankees. In fact, four of his first five starts were shutouts. The Orioles only scored one run for him on July 5, but that was enough for a win as McNally shut out the White Sox. McNally was selected to his third All-Star team in 1972. Through July 22, McNally had a 10–7 record, but he would win only three of his remaining 13 decisions. This was due in part to struggles by the Oriole offense. McNally's 2.95 ERA was lower than it had been in 1971, but the Orioles only scored 3.3 runs per game after scoring 4.7 the year before. Consequently, McNally finished with a losing record (13–17) for the first time since 1964, and his 17 losses tied with four other pitchers for third in the AL (behind Stottlemyre's and teammate Dobson's 18). He did manage to tie Tiant and Roger Nelson for fourth in the AL with six shutouts.\n\nMcNally started the 1973 season with a shutout of the Brewers on April 6. Six days later, he pitched shutout ball for innings, limiting Detroit to three hits in the Orioles' 1–0 win in 10 innings. On May 10, he threw 10 innings against Oakland, but Joe Rudi's RBI double in the 10th provided the winning margin in Oakland's 4–3 victory. He gave up 10 hits to the Yankees on June 27 but no runs in the Orioles' 4–0 victory. On September 1, he shut out the Yankees again as the Orioles prevailed 1–0. McNally's record was 9–12 after his start on August 3. He brought it to 17–16, moving his winning percentage over .500 with a victory over the Brewers on September 23, but he lost his last game of the year six days later to finish the season at 17–17. In 38 starts, he had a 3.21 ERA, 87 strikeouts, 81 walks, and 247 hits allowed in 266 innings. His 17 losses tied with Bert Blyleven and Rudy May for fifth in the AL, but his 3.21 ERA ranked ninth in the league.\n\nThe Orioles won the AL East again in 1973 and faced Oakland in the ALCS. McNally started Game 2, allowing four home runs and five runs total in innings as the Orioles lost 6–3. It was his only appearance of the series, which Oakland won in five games.\n\nOn June 15, 1974, McNally pitched 11 innings, holding the White Sox to three runs and getting the win when Boog Powell hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the 11th. Exactly two weeks later, he held the Yankees to two hits in a shutout as the Orioles won 2–0. Baltimore faced the Red Sox for a doubleheader on July 3. Starting the first game, McNally was called for two balks in the first inning. He and Weaver spent 10 minutes arguing the calls, and McNally was ejected from the game. The Orioles won the game 9–2, and in the ninth inning of Game 2, McNally came in and recorded the save in the Orioles' 6–4 win. His record was 8–8 on July 28, but McNally won eight of his last 10 decisions to up it to 16–10 by season's end. He held the Kansas City Royals scoreless on August 18, enabling the Orioles to win 1–0. On September 24, McNally gave up Al Kaline's 3,000th career hit in Baltimore; he got a no-decision in the game, but the Orioles won 5–4. In 39 games (37 starts) with the Orioles in 1974, McNally had a 16–10 record, 111 strikeouts, 81 walks, and 260 hits allowed in 259 innings. He had four shutouts, tying with five other pitchers for sixth in the league. His 3.58 ERA was 0.04 under the league average, but it was his highest since his injury-riddled 1967 season. Following the season, he requested a trade, thinking he might be helped by going to a new team.\n\nMcNally's 13-year tenure with the Orioles ended when he was traded along with Rich Coggins and minor-league right-handed pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick to the Expos for Ken Singleton and Mike Torrez on December 4, . Along with Woodie Fryman from the Detroit Tigers, he was one of two left-handed pitchers acquired that day by the Expos which was devoid of southpaws for all but three weeks of the 1974 campaign.\n\nHe was the Opening Day starter for the Expos in 1975, limiting the St. Louis Cardinals to four runs (two earned) over seven innings in an 8–4 victory on April 7. He posted a 3.19 ERA in his first four starts, winning three of them. He limited the Pirates to three runs while pitching into the ninth inning on April 22, earning his third win of the year. Thereafter, he lost six straight decisions in his last eight games, posting a 6.60 ERA. In the first game of a doubleheader on June 8 against the San Diego Padres, he gave up five runs (four earned) over six innings in what would be his last major league appearance. The next day, he retired. \"I'm not throwing the [fastball]. I have no oomph on it, and there's no ray of hope that it'll get better. There's no chance I can do a decent job, and I'm not paid to do that.\" In 12 starts with the Expos, he had a 3–6 record, a 5.24 ERA, 36 strikeouts, 36 walks, and 88 hits allowed in innings.\n\nMcNally is known for his role in the historic Seitz decision which led to the downfall of Major League Baseball's (MLB) reserve clause, ushering in the current era of free agency. McNally and Andy Messersmith were the only two players in 1975 playing on the one-year reserve clause in effect at the time. Neither had signed a contract, but both were held with their teams under the rule. The two challenged the rule and won free agency.\n\nMcNally retired in June 1975, and he had no intention of actually claiming free agency. According to John Helyar's book \"The Lords of the Realm\", players' union executive director Marvin Miller asked McNally to add his name to the grievance filed in opposition to the reserve clause, and he agreed. Miller thought of McNally, Helyar wrote, as \"insurance\" in the event that Messersmith decided to sign a new contract. The MLB wanted McNally's name off the grievance, so the Expos offered him a $25,000 ($ today) signing bonus and a $125,000 ($ today) contract if he made the team. McNally declined. The MLB hoped that Messersmith would also sign a contract, eliminating the challenge.\n\nMiller corroborated Helyar's account in his 1991 memoir, \"A Whole Different Ballgame\". Miller explained that while Messersmith was the primary test case, as he was still in the prime of his career in 1975, he wanted McNally to add his name to the grievance because he was under the assumption that Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley would end up signing Messersmith to a contract before the grievance could be decided under binding arbitration. McNally, who had been a Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) player rep during his time with the Orioles, was working as a Ford dealer in Billings, when Miller contacted him about joining the Messersmith grievance. McNally agreed, which meant that even if the Dodgers signed Messersmith to a contract, the grievance would go forward. As Miller wrote ironically, \"McNally had been a starter for fourteen years, but the last act of his career was to serve in arbitration as a reliever.\"\n\nMcNally threw the three basic pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a slider. He was very good at controlling the fastball. The slider did not come along until later; McNally had used it in the minor leagues but relied on his two other pitches until after his injury-plagued 1967 campaign. He tried throwing it in a bullpen session in 1968, impressed catcher Etchebarren with it, and added it to his repertoire for the rest of his career. Weaver said it was his ability to mix his pitches that made him successful: \"[McNally] did it with cunning and intelligence. He loved to set you up with a change, fool you with that tremendous curve and then throw that fastball by you.\" Pitching coach Bamberger concurred: \"There are pitchers who are faster and maybe have better curveballs, but the difference is McNally knows exactly how to use what he has.\" Powell remembered how little time McNally took between pitches during a game: \"It was ‘Let’s go boys; let’s get it over with and get out of here; we’ve got better things to do.’ He didn’t have overpowering anything, but he was a magician with the stuff he had.\" Ken McMullen, a hitter for the Angels who faced McNally, called his curveball \"great\" and said he could throw it \"anytime\" during an at bat. Washington star Frank Howard was one of the hitters who gave McNally the most trouble throughout his career. He and Willie Horton were the only hitters with more than six home runs against McNally in their careers; Howard hit 13 and batted .336 against him. However, McNally enjoyed a great deal of success against Howard's Senators, whom he defeated 13 times in a row before they moved to Texas after the 1971 season.\n\nJean Hoffer, McNally's high school sweetheart, married him in 1961. The couple had two sons (Jeff and Mike) and three daughters (Pam, Susan, and Anne). They purchased a home in Lutherville, Maryland in 1966. Jerry Hoffberger, who owned the Orioles, employed McNally at his brewery during offseasons. In his last active season with the Expos and shortly after he retired, McNally kept his family in Lutherville so his children could finish the school year. Just before the family moved, in late June of 1975, McNally checked in to Sinai Hospital in Baltimore with a case of chronic hiccups that had irritated him for nine days. After three more days, they went away. By his final season, he wore a wig.\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, McNally moved back to Billings, where he joined his brother, Jim, in the automotive industry. Dave had purchased a car dealership in 1973 which Jim was running. Upon his return to Billings, Dave purchased a second dealership which he ran, later opening a third dealership as well. \"I follow baseball casually, but I follow the automobile business more carefully,\" he told writer Maury Allen. Golf was a hobby of his; he had a handicap of eight in the sport. His son Jeff was drafted by the Brewers out of high school in 1980, but he never played professionally, opting instead to earn a degree at Stanford University. Diagnosed with lung and prostate cancer in 1997, McNally lived for another five years until his death in 2002.\n\nMcNally, along with Palmer and Cuellar, gave the Orioles one of the best starting rotations in history during the 1960s and early 1970s. \"Dave was an unbelievable competitor,\" Weaver said of him, also praising McNally's personality in general. \"He was 100 percent gentleman. He was the kind of guy you wanted your son to be.\" In fact, McNally and his wife, Jean, served as the godparents for Palmer's youngest daughter.\n\nHis 13 seasons with the Orioles left McNally's name among the team leaders in many statistics. His 181 wins are second in franchise history to Palmer's 268, his 33 shutouts rank second to Palmer's 53, and his innings pitched rank second to Palmer's 3948. In strikeouts, he ranks third with 1476, behind Palmer's 2212 and Mike Mussina's 1535. He is fourth in games pitched with 412 and second to Palmer in games started, with 384. He is among the Orioles' single-season records in many other categories, as well. His 24 wins in 1970 are tied for third, and his 22 wins in 1968 are tied for ninth. His 202 strikeouts in 1968 are the seventh-most in a season by an Oriole. The six shutouts he had in 1972 are tied for the fourth-most in a season by an Oriole, and his 1.95 ERA in 1968 is the ninth-lowest in a season in franchise history.\n\nIn 1978, McNally was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame. \"Sports Illustrated\" named him Montana's Athlete of the Century in 1999, and he was named to the Orioles' All-Century team that same year. In a 2004 \"Sports Illustrated\" poll asking Montanans to name the \"greatest athlete who ever lived in or played for a team in your\nstate,\" McNally finished third with 9% of the vote, behind Dave Dickenson (19%) and Jan Stenerud (18%).\n\n\n"}

He is also heir to the headship of the House of Austria-Este, a cadet branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and is sixth in line to the throne of Belgium.\n\nAmedeo was born on 21 February 1986 at the Saint-Luc University Hospital in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Belgium, as the first child and elder son of Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este, and Princess Astrid of Belgium. He bears the same given name as his paternal great-grandfather, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta. His godparents are his maternal uncle King Philippe and grandmother Queen Paola of Belgium.\n\nAmedeo himself is godfather to his cousin, Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant. Amedeo has one younger brother, Joachim (b. 1991), and three younger sisters: Maria Laura (b. 1988), Luisa Maria (b. 1995) and Laetitia Maria (b. 2003).\n\nHe was baptised and married by the archbishop of Mechelen, Cardinal Danneels.\n\nAmedeo undertook primary school and the greater part of his secondary education at the Jesuit school Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege (founded 1604) in Brussels, popular with Belgian aristocracy and royalty. He finished his secondary education at Sevenoaks School in Kent, England, between 2001 and 2004. He then spent a year in Belgium's Royal Military Academy. In September 2005, he began studies at the London School of Economics, where he graduated in 2008 with a BSc degree in Management, and took a sabbatical before entering professional life.\n\nFrom July 2009 to June 2012, Amedeo worked for Deloitte in New York City, first as a business analyst from July 2009 to June 2011, then as a management consultant in strategy and operations from July 2011 to June 2012. He then worked as a research analyst intern at Accumulus Capital Management, LLC from August through December 2012.\n\nDuring 2013 and 2014, Amedeo resumed his studies, obtaining an MBA degree at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University. He subsequently returned to Belgium, where he worked for McKinsey & Company in Brussels from September 2014 to September 2016. In January 2017, he began working at the Gutzwiller private bank in Basel, where his father is a partner.\n\nOn 15 February 2014, the Belgian Royal Court announced the engagement of Prince Amedeo to an Italian journalist, Nobile Elisabetta \"Lili\" Maria Rosboch von Wolkenstein.\nAmedeo and Elisabetta both descend from Don Giuseppe Tiberio Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau, 2nd Prince of Palazzolo, Count of Sinopoli (1627–1683), while through German princely dynasties their most recent common ancestor is Franz Albrecht I, Prince of Oettingen-Spielberg (1663–1737).\n\nThe couple's wedding was celebrated on 5 July 2014 in Rome's Basilica Santa Maria in Trastevere, in the presence of the Royal Family of Belgium (with the exception of his great-aunt Queen Fabiola), as well as members of the cadet branches of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, including the bridegroom's grandmother, Margherita of Savoy, Dowager Archduchess of Austria-Este, and members of other dynasties, including Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg and her husband Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein, Princess Beatrice of York and Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon. The couple were planning to relocate in Belgium after the wedding.\n\nAmedeo and Elisabetta have a daughter, Anna Astrid (born on 17 May 2016), and a son, Maximilian (born on 6 September 2019).\n\nIn 1991, Amedeo obtained, along with his mother and younger siblings, succession rights to the Belgian throne. In 1993, his maternal grandfather acceded to the throne as King Albert II and he became third in Belgium's line of succession, following his uncle Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant, and his mother. Upon Philippe's marriage in 1999, the prospect of Amedeo inheriting the throne substantially diminished, and the birth of a daughter and dynastic heir to Philippe in 2001 dropped his place in the order of succession down to fourth and eventually to seventh, following the birth of Philippe's other children. The abdication on 21 July 2013 of his grandfather King Albert II promoted him to sixth in line to the throne.\n\nAlthough an announcement of Amedeo's engagement was published on the Royal Family's website, no dynastic authorisation for his marriage was published prior to his wedding, as foreseen in Article 85 of the Belgian Constitution. Speculation in the media included a commentator on the military parade for \"La Une\" who, on 21 July 2014 (Belgian National Day), alleged that no royal authorisation was announced because the prince intentionally chose not to request permission to marry, and therefore Amedeo was no longer deemed in the line of succession. In November 2015, a royal decree expressing King Philippe's retroactive permission for the marriage was gazetted in the \"Moniteur Belge\".\n\n\nAll the children of Princess Astrid and Archduke Lorenz bear the title of \"Prince(ss) of Belgium\" by Belgian Royal Decree of 2 December 1991, which is distinct from their traditional Austro-Hungarian titles, i.e. \"Archduke/Archduchess of Austria-Este, Prince(ss) Royal of Hungary\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1834430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834430", "title": "Seitz decision", "text": "Seitz decision\n\nThe Seitz decision was a ruling by arbitrator Peter Seitz (died October 17, 1983) on December 23, 1975, which declared that Major League Baseball (MLB) players became free agents upon playing one year for their team without a contract, effectively nullifying baseball's reserve clause. The ruling was issued in regard to pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally.\n\nSince the 1880s, baseball owners had included a paragraph described as the reserve clause in every player contract. The paragraph as written allowed teams to renew a contract for a period of one year following the end of a signed contract. Owners asserted and players assumed that contract language effectively meant that a player could be \"reserved,\" by a ballclub's unilateral contract renewal, year after year in perpetuity by the team that had signed the player. That eliminated all market competition and kept salaries relatively low.\n\nIn 1975, Messersmith of the Los Angeles Dodgers and McNally of the Montreal Expos had had their 1974 contracts automatically renewed by their teams on the basis of this reserve clause. Since neither signed a contract during that option year, both insisted that they were free to sign with other teams the following season. The owners disagreed, arguing that under the reserve clause the one-year contracts were perpetually renewed. \n\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) filed notices of grievance on behalf of both players on October 7, 1975. Eventually hearings were held on November 21, 24 and December 1, 1975 before an Arbitration Panel composed of MLB Player Relations Committee chief negotiator John Gaherin, MLBPA Executive Director Marvin Miller and Seitz, the Chairman and Impartial Arbitrator agreed upon by both opposing parties. Seitz ruled in favor of Messersmith and McNally on December 23, 1975, declaring:\n\nSeitz's Opinion further stated:\n\nIn essence, the players were free to bargain with other teams because organized baseball could maintain a player's services for only one year after expiration of the previous contract. According to Gaherin, Seitz indicated soon after he heard arguments from both sides that he was leaning toward ruling for the players.\n\nMLB appealed the decision to the United States district court for Western Missouri, but Seitz's ruling was upheld on February 3, 1976 by Judge John Watkins Oliver, and later by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. After all appeals were exhausted, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association signed a new agreement in 1976 allowing players with six years experience to become free agents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1834432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834432", "title": "Toyota Aygo", "text": "Toyota Aygo\n\nThe Toyota Aygo is a city car sold by Toyota in Europe since 2005. It is built alongside the related Citroën C1 and Peugeot 107/108 at the Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile Czech (TPCA) joint venture in Kolín, Czech Republic. The Aygo was first displayed at the 2005 Salon de l'Automobile de Genève. The name \"Aygo\" comes from \"i-go\", symbolising freedom and mobility.\n\nThe decision to produce the cars was made on July 12, 2001, when the presidents of Toyota and PSA Peugeot Citroën, Fujio Cho and Jean-Martin Folz respectively, decided to produce a small car to share development costs. This project was called B-Zero. The Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1 are rebadged versions of the same car.\nThe Aygo's starting on the road price was (). The main difference between the Aygo and its siblings is in the interior equipment, badges, logos and the easily recognizable rear end of the car. The planned production is 300,000 cars annually – 100,000 cars per brand. Sales began in July 2005, and the car was available as a three or five door hatchback. There were two engines available, a 1.0 L three cylinder engine rated at , and a 1.4 L HDi diesel I4 engine rated at .\n\nThe Aygo was used on BBC's \"Top Gear\" in a giant match of football, showcasing its maneuverability. The \"Top Gear\" presenters deemed the Aygo and its Peugeot and Citroën counterparts to be competent town cars.\n\nA modified Aygo was also used on \"Fifth Gear\" to perform a twelve metre high loop the loop on a specially-designed track to determine if a stunt that can be done using Hot Wheels toys can be replicated in real life. The stunt was driven by stuntman Steve Truglia in May 2009.\n\nIn January 2010, the Aygo was part of a worldwide recall by Toyota for a faulty sticking accelerator pedal. It was found that under some circumstances, the pedal could stick in a partially depressed position, or return slowly to the off position. The recall affected the Aygo, Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1 models built between February 2005 and August 2009. Information from Toyota later suggested, however, that only Aygos with automatic gearboxes were affected, and that those with manual gearboxes were not.\n\nThe Aygo received its first facelift, replacing the front bumper shape from the original, and changing the rear lights to a transparent appearance, from their original red tinted cluster.\n\nThe Aygo received its second facelift, this time incorporating a much more angular bumper, and space for the inclusion of daytime running lights (DRL).\n\nBreakdown statistics reported by the German Automobile Club in May 2010 placed the Aygo (which the data grouped with the Citroën C1 and Peugeot 107) at the top of the sub small car class, in respect of the low breakdown rates achieved for cars aged between one and four years.\n\nIn 2008, Toyota created a driveable one off concept car based on the Toyota Aygo. Named the Aygo Crazy, it was unveiled to the public at the July 2008 British International Motor Show in London, before appearing at other motor shows that year based in the United Kingdom.\nAygo Crazy has a mid mounted 1.8 litre VVTi engine from the Toyota MR2 and Celica, mated to an MR2 five speed gearbox and fitted with a Toyota Motorsport turbocharger conversion. The manufacturer claims the engine produces at 6,700 rpm and torque at 3,400 rpm.\n\nWeighing just , this gives it a sprint time of 5.75 seconds and a theoretical top speed of , though the latter has not been tested. Unlike the standard Aygo, it has no driver aids, power steering or anti lock brakes but its rear wheel drive layout helps traction under heavy acceleration.\n\nExterior modifications include wider arches to accommodate the one inch of extra track, 17 inch alloy wheels with Goodyear tyres and a carbon fibre rear spoiler designed for the American Champ Car series.\n\nSuspension is from the MR2, with adjustable Tein shock absorbers and MacPherson struts front and rear. To cope with the extra power, Toyota upgraded the standard front brake discs to a Brembo conversion, with ventilated rear discs replacing the drums normally found on the Aygo.

During a 12-year baseball career, he pitched for the California Angels (1968–72), Los Angeles Dodgers (1973–75 and 1979), Atlanta Braves (1976–77) and the New York Yankees (1978). As a member of the Dodgers, he appeared in the 1974 World Series.\n\nMessersmith was born in New Jersey but at the age of 5 his family moved to Orange County, California. After graduating from Western High School in Anaheim, Messersmith received a baseball scholarship from the University of California, Berkeley. Following his junior year of college, the California Angels drafted Messersmith with the 12th overall pick in the June 1966 amateur draft. He pitched five seasons with the Angels, highlighted by his 20–13 record in , even though the Angels finished 25.5 games behind the Western Division champion Oakland A's. After finishing with a record of 8–11 in \n, attributed primarily to a finger injury that required surgery, the Angels traded Messersmith and infielder Ken McMullen to the Los Angeles Dodgers for five players - Frank Robinson, Bill Singer, Billy Grabarkewitz, Bobby Valentine, and Mike Strahler.\n\nMessersmith joined a strong Dodger rotation in , finishing the season with a 14–10 record. He shined in , finishing with 20 wins and 6 losses and a 2.59 ERA. He was the starting pitcher in the 1974 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and was one of the main factors in the Dodgers' return to the World Series for the first time since 1966, and finished second in balloting for the Cy Young Award, which was won by his Dodger teammate Mike Marshall.\n\nMessersmith is most famous for his role in the historic Seitz decision which led to the downfall of Major League Baseball's reserve clause and ushered in the current era of free agency. It began when Messersmith went to spring training in 1975 and began negotiating his 1975 contract. He asked for a no-trade clause which the Dodgers refused. According to author John Helyar, in \"The Lords of the Realm\", Messersmith was also deeply offended by general manager Al Campanis \"inject(ing) a personal issue\" into the talks (it \"cut so deeply with him\", Helyar has written, that Messersmith since has never disclosed it), and the pitcher refused to deal with anyone lower than team president Peter O'Malley.\n\nHe also pitched 1975 without a contract, leading the National League in complete games and shutouts, finishing second in earned run average with 2.29, and winning a Gold Glove (his second) as the league's best-fielding pitcher. Messersmith and Dave McNally were the only two players in 1975 playing on the one year reserve clause in effect at the time. McNally's season ended early due to injuries and he returned home, intending to retire, but agreeing to players' union director Marvin Miller's request that he sign onto the Messersmith grievance in case Messersmith ended up signing a new deal with the Dodgers before the season ended.\n\n\"It was less of an economic issue at the time than a fight for the right to have control over your own destiny\", Messersmith told \"The Sporting News\", looking back on his decision a decade later. \"It was a matter of being tired of going in to negotiate a contract and hearing the owners say, 'OK, here's what you're getting. Tough luck'.\"\n\nMessersmith and McNally won their case before arbitrator Peter Seitz, who was fired by the owners the day afterward. McNally followed through on his intention to retire but Messersmith signed a three-year, $1 million deal with the Atlanta Braves. Among other things, then-Braves owner Ted Turner suggested the nickname \"Channel\" for Messersmith and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired Braves games. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.\n\nMessersmith struggled trying to live up to his new contract which was sold to the New York Yankees for $100.000 on December 8, 1977, having gone 16–15 in two seasons with the Braves, the second marred by injuries. The Yankees released him after an injury plagued 1978 season and he signed with the Dodgers, who gave him the very thing their first refusal drove him toward testing and defeating the old reserve system: a no-trade clause. But the injuries and stress had taken too much toll; Messersmith pitched in only 11 games for the Dodgers in 1979, going 2–4 with a 4.90 ERA, and retired after the Dodgers released him. He served two stints as baseball coach at Cabrillo College, from 1986 to 1991 and from 2005 to 2007, when he retired at age 63. Messersmith's earned run average of 2.861 is the sixth lowest among starting pitchers whose careers began after the advent of the live-ball era in 1920, behind only Clayton Kershaw (2.44), Hoyt Wilhelm (2.52), Whitey Ford (2.75), Sandy Koufax (2.76), and Jim Palmer (2.856).\n\n\n\n"}

Raguletto is sold in Oceania by Simplot and in Finland by Continental Foods.\n\nThe Ragú brand was first sold in 1937 and in 2014 was the best selling U.S. brand of pasta sauce. Ragú was acquired by the Lipton and Bestfoods companies before merging with the Unilever portfolio, prior to its sale to Mizkan.\n\nThe Ragú pasta sauce line consists of smooth \"Old World Style\" sauces, \"Chunky\" sauces, bold \"Robusto!\" sauces, as well as organic and light pasta sauces. While most well known for selling jar packaged pasta sauce, Ragú also purveys a pizza sauce and an Alfredo sauce.\n\nIn its first several decades, Ragú advertising and sales broadened the appeal of Italian-American food in the United States, with slogans like \"That's Italian!\" and \"Ragú brings the Italian out in you!\" Americanized Italian cuisine is now the most common \"ethnic\" cuisine served in U.S. households, followed by variations of Americanized Mexican cuisine.\n\nCurrent advertising highlights the natural ingredients and \"full serving of veggies\" found in the sauce. Cooked tomato foods, including Ragú, are highlighted as containing the antioxidant lycopene, which is claimed to be a cancer fighting agent. As of 2015, the advertising campaign refers to the creation of Ragú by Assunta Cantisano (see below: \"History\") with the phrase \"Simmered in Tradition.\"\n\nAlthough the name is spelled with an accent like the Italian sauce, \"ragù\", the brand name Ragú is spelled with an acute accent, while the Italian word \"ragù\" (an Italian sauce typically used for dressing pasta) is spelled with a grave accent.\n\nRagú had its origins in Rochester, New York, in 1937. Assunta Cantisano and her husband Giovanni founded the Ragu Packing Company in their home in Rochester, New York, in 1937, making spaghetti sauce in their basement and selling it on their front porch. They later expanded to an entire factory. In 1969, the Ragu name was sold to Chesebrough-Pond's, which in turn was acquired by Unilever in 1987. The facility in Rochester still manufactured products under the Cantisano name brand. Some of the original facility still exists and produces products for other labels (including Newman's Own) as private label foods.\n\nThe Cantisano family left to create Cantisano Foods (now LiDestri Foods), and invented the Francesco Rinaldi brand of pasta sauce. The quotations \"As I got older, I got better\" and \"Ciao, Francesco Rinaldi\" have gained popularity since their use in commercials for Francesco Rinaldi.\n\n"}

This type of diagram was developed in 1972 by Isaac Nassi and Ben Shneiderman who were both graduate students at Stony Brook University. These diagrams are also called structograms, as they show a program's structures.\n\nFollowing a top-down design, the problem at hand is reduced into smaller and smaller subproblems, until only simple statements and control flow constructs remain. Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams reflect this top-down decomposition in a straightforward way, using nested boxes to represent subproblems. Consistent with the philosophy of structured programming, Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams have no representation for a GOTO statement.\n\nNassi–Shneiderman diagrams are only rarely used for formal programming. Their abstraction level is close to structured program code and modifications require the whole diagram to be redrawn, but graphic editors removed that limitation. They clarify algorithms and high-level designs, which make them useful in teaching. They were included in Microsoft Visio and dozens of other software tools, such as the German EasyCode.\n\nIn Germany, Nassi–Shneiderman diagrams were standardised in 1985 as DIN 66261. They are still used in German introductions to programming, for example Böttcher and Kneißl's introduction to C, Baeumle-Courth and Schmidt's introduction to C and Kirch's introduction to C#.\n\nNassi–Shneiderman diagrams can also be used in technical writing.\n\nProcess blocks: the process block represents the simplest of steps and requires no analysis. When a process block is encountered, the action inside the block is performed and we move onto the next block.\n\nBranching blocks: there are two types of branching blocks. First is the simple True/False or Yes/No branching block which offers the program two paths to take depending on whether or not a condition has been fulfilled. These blocks can be used as a looping procedure stopping the program from continuing until a condition has been fulfilled.\n\nThe second type of branching block is a multiple branching block. This block is used when a select case is needed in a program. The block usually contains a question or select case. The block provides the program with an array of choices and is often used in conjunction with sub process blocks to save space.\n\nTesting loops: this block allows the program to loop one or a set of processes until a particular condition is fulfilled. The process blocks covered by each loop are subset with a side-bar extending out from the condition.\n\nThere are two main types of testing loops, test first and test last blocks. The only difference between the two is the order in which the steps involved are completed.\nIn the test first situation, when the program encounters the block it tests to see if the condition is fulfilled, then, if it is not completes the process blocks and then loops back. The test is performed again and, if the condition is still unfulfilled, it processes again. If at any stage the condition is fulfilled the program skips the process blocks and continues onto the next block.\n\nThe test last block is simply reversed, the process blocks are completed before the test is performed. The test last loop allows for the process blocks to be performed at least once before the first test.\n\nConcurrent execution can be drawn like this:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1834468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834468", "title": "Slovak cuisine", "text": "Slovak cuisine\n\nSlovak cuisine varies slightly from region to region across Slovakia. It was influenced by the traditional cuisine of its neighbours and it influenced them as well. The origins of traditional Slovak cuisine can be traced to times when the majority of the population lived self-sufficiently in villages, with very limited food imports and exports and with no modern means of food preservation or processing.\n\nThis gave rise to a cuisine heavily dependent on a number of staple foods that could stand the hot summers and cold winters. These included wheat, potatoes, milk and milk products, pork meat, sauerkraut and onion. To a lesser degree beef, poultry, lamb and goat, eggs, a few other local vegetables, fruit and wild mushrooms were traditionally eaten.\n\nAll these were usually produced and processed by families themselves with some local trade at the country markets. Wheat was ground, and bread, dumplings and noodles were made from it. Potatoes were mostly boiled or processed into potato dough. Milk was processed into a wide range of products such as butter, cream, sour cream, buttermilk, and various types of cheese etc.\n\nTypical pork products include sausages, smoked bacon, and lard. Spices were not widely used, and animal fats and butter were used instead of cooking oils. Main beverages included fresh and sour milk, and beer. Contemporary Slovak cuisine is widely influenced by various world cuisines and uses many different ingredients, spices and industrially processed foods.\n\n\n\nPork, beef and poultry are the main meats consumed in Slovakia, with pork being the most popular by a substantial margin. Among poultry, chicken is most common, although duck, goose, and turkey are also well established. Game meats, especially boar, rabbit, and venison, are also widely available throughout the year. Lamb and goat are also available, but for the most part are not very popular. The consumption of horse meat is generally frowned upon.\n\nGrilled meat is not common in Slovakia. Instead, meat is either breaded and fried in oil (schnitzel), or cooked and served in sauce. Hungarian influences in Slovak cuisine can be seen in popular stews and goulashes. However, these have been given Slovak touches. Chicken paprikash is typically served with halušky and Hungarian goulash (spicy beef stew) is served with slices of a large bread-like steamed dumpling.\n\nLocal sausage types include \"krvavničky\", a blood sausage, and \"jaternice\" (traditionally called \"hurky\"), a sausage with rice containing any and all parts of a butchered pig. \n\nUsually baked at Christmas time, but also all year long, Slovak traditional sweets are usually home baked and harder to find in stores.\n\nTraditionally the main meal of the day is lunch, eaten around noon. However, changing work routine has altered this in the recent decades; today, many Slovaks have their main meal in the evening. Lunch in Slovakia usually consists of soup and a main course. It is customary in Slovakia to bring a bottle of wine or other alcohol as a gift if you are invited to visit someone's home.\n\n\n\n"}

In Lincolnshire, sock dyke was formerly a frequently found form of the expression. \n\nIn some parts of the world, the embankment would be called a levee.\n\nThe soak is the ground water in the peat or silt of the fenland, though the term is often used to mean water table. \n\nIn The Fens, water from the surrounding higher land is carried across the land which lies below high tide level, in embanked rivers. In this way, the need for pumping is reduced. However, the banks are never completely waterproof so that even in an otherwise thoroughly drained fen, the water table near the river bank would be high, reducing the value of the land and weakening the bank.\n\nThe leaky condition of the river embankments usually arose from a difficulty in finding good materials for their construction and from the piecemeal way in which the structures accumulated as the ground shrank or repairs were needed. \n\nThe difficulty is overcome by cutting a fairly small ditch, perhaps twenty or thirty metres from the bank, so that it collects the ground water and feeds it to a pump.\n\nCounter drain is another term for much the same thing though in this case, it may have been designed also to deal with water overflowing the river bank. The counter drain would therefore need to be bigger than the soak dike. Counter drain has tended to supersede the other term, particularly in its use as a proper name. \n\nThe Counter Drain in Deeping Fen is a good example, where the land between it and the bank of the River Glen was designed as a wash. In other words, the land between the river and the outer bank of the counter drain was originally intended to act as a reservoir in the event of an overflow from the river.\n"}

While laughter is popularly thought of as a pleasure response, in tickle torture, the one being tickled may laugh whether or not they find the experience pleasant. In a tickling situation, laughter can indicate a panic reflex rather than a pleasure response. Tickle torture may be a consensual activity or one that is forced, depending on the circumstances. In a consensual form, tickle torture may be part of a mutually fulfilling, physically-intimate act between partners. However, forced tickle torture can cause real physical and mental distress in a victim, which is why it has been used as an interrogation method or to simply show dominance over another person.\n\n\"Chinese tickle torture\" is an ancient form of torture practiced by the Chinese, in particular the courts of the Han Dynasty. Chinese tickle torture was a punishment for nobility since it left no marks and a victim could recover relatively easily and quickly.\n\nAnother example of tickle torture was used in ancient Rome, where a person’s feet were dipped in a salt solution, and a goat was brought in to lick the solution off. This type of tickle torture would only start as tickling, eventually becoming extremely painful.\n\nJosef Kohout, a man persecuted in the Flossenbürg concentration camp during World War II, witnessed Nazi prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate, followed by various other tortures which resulted in his death. This incident is described in Heinz Heger's book \"The Men With The Pink Triangle\": \"The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the armpits, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain.\"\n\nAn article in the \"British Medical Journal\" about European tortures describes a method of tickle torture in which a goat was compelled to lick the victim's feet because they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself. However, it remains unclear if this method was ever used in practice as it is only described in the 1502 \"Tractatus de indiciis et tortura\" by the Italian jurist and monk Franciscus Brunus de San Severino - a treatise that actually cautioned against torture in general - and while it seems clear that Franciscus Brunus had not made up this practice, the issue is left open whether the inclusion in the treatise is based on hearsay, (reliable) eye-witness accounts or personal experience. This uncertainty does not preclude this anecdote from being repeated in popular culture, for instance during a 2013 episode of the British satirical quiz show QI.\n\nIn ancient Japan, those in positions of authority could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called shikei, which translates as ‘private punishment.’ One such torture was kusuguri-zeme: \"merciless tickling.\"\n\nIn his book \"Sibling Abuse\", Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as vomiting, incontinence (losing control of bladder), and losing consciousness due to inability to breathe.\n\nThere is currently no evidence that tickle torture was ever widespread or was practiced by governments. The very small amount of related documentation discovered thus far originates from England and the United States.\n\nA 1903 article described an immobilized suicidal patient at the Hudson River State Hospital who was tied to a bed for his own safety. While he lay helpless, the patient's feet were tickled by one of the hospital attendants, Frank A. Sanders. \"Sanders is said to have confessed that while intoxicated he amused himself by tickling the feet and ribs of Hayes and pulling his nose.\" Sanders also gave his restrained victim a black eye. Another hospital employee came upon Sanders while he was entertaining himself at his patient's expense, and the criminal was brought before a grand jury.\n\nAn 1887 article entitled \"England in Old Times\" states \"Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden yoke, while sundry small but fiendish boys improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet.\"\n\nThe term \"tickle torture\" can apply to many different situations that do not include the aforementioned acts of either sexual gratification or malicious torture.\n\n\"Tickle torture\" can be an extended act of tickling where the recipient of the tickling would view it as a long time or tickling of an intense nature. This can be due to the length of time they are tickled, the intensity of the tickling or the areas that are being tickled. This can simply be a 30-second tickle applied to the victim's bare feet, which can seem like a much longer time if the victim's feet are very ticklish. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, other commonly ticklish areas include the armpits, sides of the torso, neck, knee, midriff, thighs, navel, and the ribs. Many people consider the soles of their feet the most ticklish, due to the many nerve endings located there: this explains why tickling one's feet against their will is the most common example of \"tickle torture\".\n\n\"Tickle torture\" may also have other uses, including the act of tickling a person as a means of humiliating someone, or even an interrogation method. This may not be extreme tickling, but could include prolonged tickling upon a sensitive area until the victim has released the required information. In the former case, it could be used as a way of humiliating a person, as the act of being tickled can produce many sounds and sensations that could be viewed as being embarrassing to the victim. In this way, the tickling can continue to the point where a certain reaction is revealed.\n\nThis method of \"humiliating\" could also incorporate the use of physical restraint or restraint using materials. This would be done to leave a desired area of the body bare and vulnerable to the tickling, in a way that the victim would not be able to remove this area from the tickling, and would have to simply endure. This can also be seen as \"punishment\" or \"payback\" as the tickler could be using the tickling as retribution from a previous tickling experience or \"humiliating event\".\n\nIn sexual fetishism, tickle torture is an activity between consenting partners. A torture session usually begins with one partner allowing the other to tie them up in a position that exposes bare parts of the body, particularly those that are sensitive to tickling. Though many parts of the human body are deemed ticklish, tickle torture is commonly associated with the tickling of the bare feet or armpits.\n\nThe bondage methods of the tickling usually follows the same basic methods. The object of the bondage is to render the victim unable to remove themselves from the tickling, as well as rendering the ticklish areas of the victim vulnerable. The victim is usually bound in a sitting or lying position rather than a standing one as to expose the soles of the feet which are often among the areas upon which tickling is inflicted. The restraint of the arms above the head leaves the upper body and underarms susceptible to the tickling. This enables the torturer to use whatever they want, e.g. fingers, tongue, beard, feathers, brush, pine cones, salt sticks, electric toothbrush or a hairbrush.\n\nIn VeggieTales's \"Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen\", King Xerxes disposes of criminals by banishing them to the Island of Perpetual Tickling, to which Death, wielding a scythe-sized feather, escorts them. Thus, tickle torture serves here as a family-friendly depiction of capital punishment.\n\nThe TV series \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" had a recurring character named Don Turtelli whose main form of torture was to take a feather to the soles of the feet of his captives.\n\nTickle torture has become the subject of many fetish/sexual publications. These fictional writings can portray a fantasy of a desirable character, often a celebrity, being restrained and interrogated. These stories are not always sexual, although they are mostly the object of sexual fantasies and dreams. Because of the fantasy element of the plot, the characters are often magical or the circumstances are completely imaginative.\n\nIn one of the light novels of the \"Naruto Secret Chronicle\" series, the shinobi Sai uses tickle torture on an ANBU member he was interrogating, as the man had been taught to withstand traditional torture. The action succeeded in them finding the location of their comrade, Sakura Haruno.\n\n"}

France, which had previously dominated the canal and whose investors still controlled the majority of shares in the Suez Canal Company, hoped to weaken British control and attempted to sway European opinion for internationalizing the canal.\n\nThe two powers compromised by neutralizing the canal through the treaty. Article I, guaranteeing passage to all ships during war and peace, was in tension with Article X, which allowed the Khedive to take measures for \"the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order.\" The latter clause was used to defend their actions by the British in the Second World War and by Egypt against Israeli shipping after 1948. However, Britain accepted the treaty reluctantly and only with serious reservations:\n\nThe delegates of Great Britain, in offering this text as the definitive rule to secure the free use of the Suez Canal, believe it is their duty to announce a general reservation as to the applicability of its provisions in so far as they are incompatible with the transitory and exceptional state in which Egypt is actually found and so far as they might fetter the liberty of action of the government during the occupation of Egypt by the British forces.\n\nFrance accepted the reservation but, in accordance with international law at the time, noted that this made the treaty a \"technically inoperative\" \"academic declaration.\" The reservation was not removed until the Entente Cordiale between Britain and France, and the convention finally came into force in 1904. The Entente stipulated that the functioning of the international supervisory commission described in article 8 would \"remain in abeyance.\" However, for the next forty years, British actions would be largely in the spirit of the abandoned reservation.\n\nOn 5 August 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, Egypt declared that the canal would be open to ships of all nations, but Britain converted its occupation into a British protectorate and barred canal access to enemy ships. Citing the security of the canal, Britain attempted to maintain its prerogatives in unilateral declarations.\n\nThe signatories comprised all the great European powers in 1888, and the treaty was interpreted as a guaranteed right of passage of all ships through the Suez Canal during war and peace.\n\nSubsequent wars and skirmishes passed control of the Canal to various powers, including the United Kingdom, Egypt, Israel, and the United Nations. In 1956 the Egyptian Government nationalized the Suez Canal. On June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War, Egypt closed and blockaded the canal against Israel. The waterway reopened on June 10, 1975. A multinational observer force (including the United States, Israel, and Egypt) currently oversees the canal, which is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority of the Arab Republic of Egypt. According to the international rules which govern navigation through Suez, Egypt cannot forbid any vessel from passing through the Suez Canal if there is no war between Egypt and that country.\n\n\n"}

Being accorded the highest military decoration, the Hero of the Soviet Union title, for the skill and courage in commanding a division in the 1939-1940 Finnish campaign, Kirponos is remembered for his leading role in the failed defense of the Ukraine during the Battle of Brody, the Battle of Uman, and Kiev in the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union. He was killed in action by German fire in the defense of Kiev on 20 September 1941.\n\nKirponos was born in a poor peasant family and worked as a forester. He was conscripted in 1915 and took part in World War I. In 1917 he joined the Red Army, fought in the Russian Civil War, and joined the Bolshevik party in 1918.\n\nIn 1927 he graduated from the M. V. Frunze Military Academy. After graduation he was chief of staff of the 44th Rifle Division, then commandant of the Kazan Military School from 1934 to 1939 on behalf of the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar Autonomous Republic.\n\nOn 21 March 1940, he was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions during the Soviet-Finnish War. He became commander of the Leningrad Military District the same year.\n\nIn February 1941 he was assigned commander of the Kiev Military District, which was transformed into the Southwestern Front at the beginning of the German-Soviet War. On the night of 21 June 1941, the day before the launch of Operation Barbarossa by the Wehrmacht, Mikhail Kirponos disregarded the strict instruction from Stavka to ignore rumors of the pending invasion the next day and spent the night preparing mission orders for his command. That same night, the unfortunate D. G. Pavlov of the Western Front accepted Stavka's assertion that rumors of war were deception at face value and went to the opera in Minsk.\n\nWhile his front-line units were under the Stavka's general order to treat any German attack as a likely provocation, and not to return fire, just as all other front line units of the Soviet armies of the frontier had been instructed, the armies of the Southwestern Front were alert, and had not been completely stood down. It is possibly because of this wary attitude of Kirponos and his staff that the Southwestern Front was not caught completely flat footed when the Germans attacked.\n\nDisposition of forces for the Southwestern Front, and considerable terrain advantages also favored Kirponos in comparison to his counterparts in Byelorussia. In general, his command had more forces to deploy in depth, and von Runstedt's Army Group South only attacked with a single Panzer army, as opposed to two available to Army Group Center. Stavka in fact believed that Kirponos had enough forces under his command to effectively comply with Stavka's General Chief of Staff G. K. Zhukov's \"Directive No. 3\", which called for a counterattack by the Southwestern Front with the objective of seizing Lublin in German occupied Poland. Kirponos, and his staff were ambivalent about this ambitious proposal.\n\nShortly thereafter, Zhukov himself showed up at Southwestern Front headquarters at Ternopil with Nikita Khrushchev in tow, to personally direct the operation. The result was the ill-fated attack against the flanks of the 1st Panzer Group that was advancing toward Kiev between the 5th and 6th armies, known as the Battle of Brody.\n\nSevere communications, logistics and coordination problems plagued the operation, and as a consequence, the uncoordinated Mechanized Corps showed up late to their jump-off points in a disorganized fashion, without their complete complement of equipment and entered the battle piecemeal.\n\nThe fact that Zhukov and Kirponos were at odds about the offensive deepened these problems with Kirponos issuing a general order to cease the offensive on the 27th of June, because he wanted to make his front line shorter, \"so as to prevent the enemy tank groupings from penetrating into the rear of the 6th and 26th Armies\", according to H. Baghramyan.* This order was quickly countermanded by Zhukov who ordered the attack resumed, an order that was promptly refused on the \"personal responsibility\" of the commander of the 9th Mechanized Corps, Konstantin Rokossovsky, leaving the commander of the 8th Mechanized Corps unaware that he was engaging alone.\n\nDespite these difficulties, and the eventual loss of the great majority of the tanks involved in the fight, the German command was taken off guard.\n\nEven though in the balance the Southwestern Front did comparatively better than the other Front commands in the frontier battles, and generally maintained organizational cohesion and some operational initiative, Nikita Khrushchev noted that Zhukov said \"I am afraid your commander (Kirponos) here is pretty weak\". Zhukov was soon forced to return to Moscow due to the critical situation developing along the Bialystok-Minsk-Smolensk axis, and the Southwestern Front, and newly formed Southern Front created on the basis of the Odessa Military District, were put under the umbrella of the \"Southwestern Direction\" commanded by Marshal Semyon Budyonny, a long time Stalin associate, in mid July, with disastrous results in the Battle of Uman.\n\nAfterwards, Kirponos' forces fought in the Battle of Kiev. He was killed in action during the defense of Kiev, in which the Soviets ended up losing badly due to the overwhelming advantage by the Germans, which was exacerbated by the grave errors of Joseph Stalin and the high-ranking military leaders. Nevertheless, more than sixty years later and after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kirponos remains highly regarded both in Ukraine and Russia for his exemplary military leadership, courage and valour.\n\n"}

He was part of the Blackburn Rovers side that won the Premier League in 1995 and earned 11 caps for England. He also played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Swindon Town, Leicester City, Stockport County, Coventry City and Manchester City.\n\nIn May 2014 Flowers became goalkeeping coach of championship club Nottingham Forest. He was hired as part of Stuart Pearce's backroom staff. In February 2015 Flowers left the club after the departure of Pearce and appointment of Dougie Freedman - he left alongside Steve Wigley and Brian Eastick, who had worked alongside him as colleagues.\n\nFlowers was born in Kenilworth and began his career with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1984. He quickly broke into the first team, becoming their regular goalkeeper by his 18th birthday, but his breakthrough came at the bleakest time in the club's history, as the two seasons he spent there both ended in relegation (in 1984–85) to the Third Division and in 1985–86 to the Fourth. After Wolves fell into the Fourth Division to complete a hat-trick of successive relegations, they had to sell Flowers as part of the effort to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nHe joined First Division club Southampton for £70,000 in June 1986. He was understudy to Peter Shilton in 1986–87, but managed nine league appearances (the first in a 5–1 defeat to Manchester United in mid September) and also played a further nine games on loan to Swindon Town in the Third Division. He made another nine league appearances in 1987–88 (by which time Shilton had joined Derby County) and returned to Swindon for a five-match loan spell, before becoming Southampton's regular goalkeeper in the 1989–90 season. Within a couple of years of becoming Southampton's first choice goalkeeper, Flowers was regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the English league and inevitable rumours of a transfer to a bigger club began.\n\nHe finally left Southampton on 4 November 1993 when a £2.4million move to Blackburn Rovers made him the most expensive goalkeeper in Britain. His excellent goalkeeping was not quite enough to win Blackburn the Premier League title that season, but they did finish second to Manchester United, and went one better the following year when they won their first top division title since 1914. He remained at Ewood Park for another four seasons before Blackburn were relegated in 1999.\n\nHe was transferred to Leicester City, where he collected a Football League Cup winner's medal in his first season. In August 2002 he went on loan to Manchester City to provide cover for Carlo Nash after injuries to Peter Schmeichel and Nicky Weaver. He stayed with Leicester for one season after their relegation to Division One two years later before retiring as a player. His final appearance for Leicester City was against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux in May 2003. It was the final game of the season, and with Leicester 1–0 down, Flowers came on as a late substitute for Ian Walker. Leicester were awarded a late penalty, and despite shouts from the travelling Leicester fans for Flowers to take the penalty, and Flowers himself signalling to the bench, Micky Adams (then Leicester manager) ignored the fans, and allowed Trevor Benjamin to take it, who scored.\n\nFlowers won 11 caps with England between 1993 and 1998. He was in the squads for both Euro 96 in England and the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. He retired following the 2002–03 season.\n\nFollowing a spell as goalkeeper coach for both Leicester City and Manchester City, on 19 February 2007 he was appointed as assistant manager to Iain Dowie at Coventry City. Flowers left Coventry on 11 February 2008 after Dowie was sacked, before joining him again at Queens Park Rangers. He left the assistant manager's role at QPR as well after Dowie was sacked again.\n\nIn February 2010, he was appointed part-time goalkeeper coach at Northampton Town, as well as mentoring Dean Coleman and Yasbir Singh at Kidderminster Harriers.\n\nOn 17 March 2010, he re-joined Dowie when he was appointed as assistant manager at Premiership club, Hull City.\n\nOn 14 October he was appointed manager of Conference North team Stafford Rangers. However, Flowers resigned on 11 January 2011 after just nine games in charge.\n\nOn 22 November 2011, Flowers become manager of his second club, this time being appointed caretaker manager of Northampton Town on 22 November 2011. He only managed the club for one game, losing 4–1 to Plymouth Argyle, before Aidy Boothroyd became permanent manager at the club, although Flowers remained as goalkeeping coach.\n\nWhen Boothroyd was sacked by Northampton in January 2014, Flowers continued on the coaching staff under caretaker boss Andy King, but he left the club on 30 January 2014 following the appointment earlier that week of Chris Wilder as the new manager of Northampton Town.\n\nOn 6 March 2014 he was appointed first-team coach at Kidderminster Harriers.\n\nIn July 2014, Flowers started working as a goalkeeper coach at Nottingham Forest under his former teammate, Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce. Flowers left Forest following the dismissal of Pearce in February 2015.\n\nOn 11 September 2015, it was reported that Flowers had replaced Gary Whild as manager of Kidderminster Harriers, but he left the club within a fortnight to be replaced by Dave Hockaday.\n\nOn 20 June 2018, he returned to management with Solihull Moors replacing Mark Yates, who had joined newly promoted Football League side Macclesfield Town.

{"id": "1834544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834544", "title": "Ordnance QF 2-pounder", "text": "Ordnance QF 2-pounder\n\nThe Ordnance QF 2-pounder (QF denoting \"quick firing\"), or simply \"2 pounder gun\", was a British anti-tank and vehicle-mounted gun employed in the Second World War.\n\nIt was used in the Battle of France and during the North African Campaign. In its vehicle-mounted variant the 2-pounder was a common main gun on British tanks early in World War II, as well as being a typical main armament of armoured cars, such as the Daimler, throughout the war. As Axis tanks' armoured protection improved, the 2-pounder lost effectiveness and it was gradually replaced by the 6-pounder starting in 1942, though some remained in service until the end of the war.\n\nThis QF 2-pounder was not the same gun as the QF 2 pounder \"pom-pom\" gun extensively used by the Royal Navy as an anti-aircraft gun although they both fired , projectiles.\n\nThe gun was developed as both a tank weapon and an anti-tank gun. For reasons of economy and standardization, it was accepted - as the 2-pdr Mark IX - for both purposes in October 1935. Carriages for the gun were designed by Vickers and the Design Department at the Woolwich Arsenal.\n\nVickers was the first to submit a design, which was accepted as the \"Ordnance QF 2-pounder Mark IX on Carriage Mark I\". A limited number of pieces was built in 1936. The carriage had an innovative three-legged construction. In the travelling position, one of the legs was used as a towing trail, and the other two were folded. When the gun was positioned for combat, the legs were emplaced on the ground and the wheels were lifted up. Woolwich Arsenal had continued to develop their carriage and when re-examined was seen to be superior to Vickers design, and with this carriage the gun was adopted as \"Ordnance QF 2-pounder Mark IX on Carriage Mark II\". It was conceptually similar, although when the gun was emplaced for combat the wheels had to be removed. This carriage was also manufactured by Vickers.\n\nThe unusual construction gave the gun good stability and a traverse of 360 degrees, allowing it to quickly engage moving vehicles from any approach. With the Vickers carriage, the gun could also be fired from its wheels, at the expense of limited traverse. The 40 mm 2-pounder could outperform a typical 37 mm piece, such as the German 3.7 cm PaK 36 or the Bofors 37 mm, and significantly outclassed 25mm and 20mm weapons of that era. A drawback of the 2-pounder was that it was nearly twice as heavy as the PaK 36 and had a higher profile.\n\nThe gun was first put into use on a tank as the main armament of the Vickers-designed Cruiser Tank Mk I.\n\nA late-war project was the Canadian David High Velocity to allow 2-pdr ammunition to be fired from the larger-calibre 6-pdr. This was intended to improve the muzzle velocity of the shot. The system was still being developed when the war ended, the program ending along with it.\n\nAnother development was the 2-pdr HV 'Pipsqueak', a postwar gun using a 40x438R cartridge originally intended as the main armament for the Saladin armoured car that was to replace the AEC Armoured Car. This was designed to fire Armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) rounds, which would match the penetration of the 'Littlejohn' shot while still allowing high-explosive (HE) shells to be fired. In fact, the claimed performance was better, the 1,295 m/s shot penetrating 85mm of armour at 60 degrees at 900m. Development of this gun was also abandoned when the role of the Saladin shifted towards infantry fire support, and a low-velocity 76mm cannon was selected for it instead.\n\nInitially one of the most serious shortcomings of the 2-pdr was the lack of a high-explosive shell, especially when the 2-pdr was the main gun of a tank; this was very important when a tank was being used for infantry support, leaving it with only its machine gun for anti-personnel use. A high-explosive shell was not produced until late 1942. \n\nThe 2-pdr gun became a part of the Royal Artillery in 1938, when five field brigades were converted to anti-tank regiments. In the early western campaigns, the 2-pdr was employed by two types of Royal Artillery formations: anti-tank regiments of infantry divisions (four batteries with 12 pieces each), and light anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiments of armoured divisions (two 12-gun AT batteries). From October 1940, separate 48-gun anti-tank regiments were introduced in armoured divisions too. Infantry brigade structure initially included an anti-tank company, though it was typically equipped with 25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank guns; these companies were disbanded later in the war. From 1942, infantry battalions received their own six-gun anti-tank platoons. The organization was different in the Far East theatres. The exact internal structure of AT units was also subject to changes and variations.\n\nThe gun first saw combat with the Belgian Army during the German invasion of the Low Countries, and then with the British Army during the subsequent rear-guard actions at Dunkirk. Most of the British Army's 2-pdrs were left behind in France during the retreat, stripping most of the army's infantry anti-tank capability. Those guns captured at Dunkirk entered German service under the designation 4.0 cm Pak 192 (e) or 4.0 cm Pak 154 (b), the \"e\" and \"b\" referring to the origin (English or Belgian Army).\n\nAlthough the Woolwich Arsenal had already designed a successor to the 2-pdr, the 6 pounder gun, it was decided in the face of a likely German invasion to re-equip the army with the 2-pdr, avoiding the period of adaptation to production, and also of re-training and acclimatization with the new weapon. This had the effect of delaying production of the 6 pounder until November 1941, and availability to frontline units to spring 1942. Consequently, for most of the North African Campaign, the army had to rely on the 2-pdr, aided by the 25 pounder gun-howitzer functioning as an anti-tank gun—a role for which it was capable, though at the expense of taking it away from its main artillery role. As German tank design evolved, anti-armour performance of the 2-pdr gradually became insufficient; however, the gun owes a large part of the bad reputation it gained during the campaign to the open terrain, which made the high-silhouette piece hard to conceal, and to poor tactics.\n\nIn North Africa, it was found that the 2-pdr was damaged by being towed long distances across rough, stony deserts. Starting in 1941, the British developed the \"en portee\" method of mounting the 2-pdr, and later the 6-pounder, on a truck. Though only intended for transport, with the gun carried unloaded, crews tended to fire from their vehicles for more mobility, with consequent casualties. Hence the vehicles tended to reverse into action so that the gunshield of the 2-pdr would provide a measure of protection against enemy fire.\n\nFrom mid-1942, the 2-pdr was increasingly displaced to infantry anti-tank platoons, to Home Guard units in Great Britain, and to the Far East, where it was still effective against the smaller and more lightly armoured Japanese tanks. It was finally removed from service entirely in December 1945. As a vehicle weapon, it remained in use throughout the war. Although most tanks equipped with it were withdrawn or upgraded to the 6-pdr, it remained in use with armoured cars.\n\nIts performance as an anti-armour weapon was improved later in the war with the development of more sophisticated ammunition and got an additional boost with the introduction of the Littlejohn adaptor, which converted it to a squeeze-bore design firing specially-designed shells at much higher velocities. (However, the Littlejohn adaptor prevented the use of High Explosive rounds.) These improvements, however, were constantly outpaced by improvements in tank design.\n\nGun variants:\nCarriage variants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They form the western branch of the South Semitic languages, itself a sub-branch of Semitic, part of the Afroasiatic language family.\n\nAmharic, the official working language of Federal Government of Ethiopia and Amhara Region, has about 21 million speakers (including second language speakers) and is the most widely spoken Ethiopian Semitic language. Tigrinya has 7 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language in Eritrea. There is a small population of Tigre speakers in Sudan. The Ge'ez language has a literary history in its own Ge'ez script going back to the first century AD. It is no longer spoken but remains the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, as well as their respective Eastern Catholic counterparts.\n\nThe \"homeland\" of the South Semitic languages is widely debated, with sources such as A. Murtonen (1967) and Lionel Bender (1997), suggesting an origin in Ethiopia and others suggesting the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. A study based on a Bayesian model to estimate language change concluded that the latter viewpoint may be more probable.\n\nThe modern Ethiopian Semitic languages all share subject–object–verb (SOV) word order as part of the Ethiopian language area, but Ge'ez had verb-subject-object (VSO) order in common with other Semitic languages.\n\nThe division into northern and southern branches was established by Cohen (1931) and Hetzron (1972) and garnered broad acceptance, but this classification has recently been challenged by Rainer Voigt. Voigt rejects the classification that was put forward by Cohen and Hetzron, concluding that they are too closely related to be grouped separately into a north and south.\n\nHudson (2013) recognises five primary branches of Ethiosemitic. His classification is below.\n\n"}

These crosstown buses are designated differently from older de facto crosstown routes, such as the #1 (Harvard/Holyoke Gate - Dudley Station via Massachusetts Avenue) and the #66 (Harvard Square - Dudley Station via Allston & Brookline Village). The bus services are very similar in equipment and fare structure, except that the CT routes have more-limited stops. Both types of routes suffer from frequent delays, unreliable service, and bus bunching caused by congestion in heavy mixed traffic.\n\nThe CT crosstown buses were envisioned as a first phase in a gradual improvement of circumferential service connecting the radial \"spokes\" of the Metro Boston rapid transit system, planned to culminate in the Urban Ring. The CT routes run weekdays only; all buses in this service have bicycle racks and are based out of the Albany Street garage. The routes were first introduced in September 1994 and have been modified since. A third route, the CT1, was merged with route in 2019.\n\nWith the suspension of the Urban Ring Project (due to lack of funding), the crosstown bus routes remain as an interim service to meet demand for circumferential routes that bypass the crowded subway stations in the hub of downtown Boston.\n\nThe CT1 Central Square, Cambridge - B.U.

It is famous for its eloquent epitaph in fornyrðislag for all the five sons of a man. The runestone was found when the church was demolished in 1874. Fragments of some other runestones were found as well. The Rundata project dates them to the late 10th century.\n\nThe following presentations show the runic inscription transliterated into Latin script, followed by transcriptions into Old East Norse dialect of Old Norse, and it ends with a translation into English.\n\nThe Högby rune stone is in style Pr1. It commemorates Assur, one of the first Varangians who is known to have died in the service of the Byzantine Emperor, and he is estimated to have died c. 1010, or in the late 10th century. He was one of the sons of the \"good man\" Gulli, and the rune stone describes a situation that may have been common for Scandinavian families at this time: the stone was made on the orders of Assur's niece Þorgerðr in memory of her uncles who were all dead. \n\nÞorgerðr probably had the stone made as soon as she had learnt that Assur, the last one of her uncles, had died in Greece, and she probably did this to ensure her right of inheritance.

The album became a worldwide commercial success. It debuted at number four on \"Billboard\" 200, number one in Japan, and in the top-ten throughout almost every major worldwide music market. \"#1's\" was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and double-platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) denoting shipments of five and two million copies. The album reported sales in Japan at 3,250,000 copies in the first three months and remains the best-selling album of all-time in Japan by a non-Asian artist.\n\n\"When You Believe\", a duet with Whitney Houston, charted well around the world, peaking at number fifteen in the United States, the top-two in Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and the top-five in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and reaching number one in Hungary. \"When You Believe\" was featured in \"The Prince of Egypt\" soundtrack, and received the Academy Award for Best Original Song. The album's third single, \"I Still Believe\", performed best of the four new songs, peaking at number four.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, Carey released \"#1 to Infinity\", an updated version of \"#1's\" with all 18 of her number-ones, to coincide with the beginning of her residency show of the same name in Las Vegas, \"#1 to Infinity\". The album sold over 15,000,000 units worldwide.\n\nDuring mid-1998, after the release of her seventh studio album, \"Butterfly\" (1997), the previous September, Carey was in the midst of developing a film and soundtrack project titled \"All That Glitters\". Midway through the project, \"All That Glitters\" fell into developmental hell, causing Carey to pause the entire production. During this period, Carey considered embarking on a tour to support \"Butterfly\", which was continuing to sell strongly. However, executives at Sony Music, the parent company of Carey's label Columbia, wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the commercially favorable holiday season. Carey, not having time to record a studio album, agreed. However, they disagreed as to what content and singles should constitute the album. Sony wanted to release an album that featured her US number one singles, void of any new material. Carey on the other hand, felt that a greatest hits album should reflect on her most personal and favorite songs, not necessarily her most commercial. Additionally, Carey felt that not including any new material would be unfair to fans, and eventually four new songs were included to accompany her 13 number-ones. Despite having reached this compromise with Sony, Carey often expressed distaste towards the album's song selection, most notably vocalizing her disappointment in the omission of her \"favorite songs\" in a note to fans included within the album's liner notes.\n\nWith Carey insisting that the compilation is not a greatest hits collection, Sony titled the album \"#1's\" to reflect the fact that the album is a collection of her number one hits rather than her \"greatest\" or \"favorite\" songs. Carey has frequently cited \"Underneath the Stars\" (1996) and \"Breakdown\" (1998) as examples of songs she was unsuccessful in releasing on the collection. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote that she was releasing a collection of her number one singles as a \"thank you\" and a tribute to her fans, and explained that someday she would release a true greatest hits album containing songs that were not released as singles, as well as singles that did not reach number one. In December 2001, Columbia released the album \"Greatest Hits\", which featured Carey's number one singles alongside songs she said \"needed to be really heard\", such as \"Underneath the Stars\" and \"Forever\". In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding the album: \"There's a lot of songs that I'm happy are gonna see the light of day. I think people are going to like this \"Greatest Hits\" because there are songs on it that were not necessarily singles.\"\n\nThe first of Carey's number ones to be featured on the album was \"Vision of Love\". It was Carey's first single and was the song that propelled her into the music scene. The song received acclaim, and was credited with influencing and popularizing the use of melisma throughout the 1990s. Three other songs were included from her self-titled debut album, of them were \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\" and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\". The fifth single featured on the album was \"Emotions\", the lead single from the album of the same name. Because of the album's strict array of chart topping singles, none of the other singles on \"Emotions\" made the track listing. Another song that was featured on \"#1's\" was Carey's version of The Jackson 5 classic, \"I'll Be There\", which was the lead single from her live album, \"MTV Unplugged\". The singles from Carey's 1993 release \"Music Box\", made an appearance on the album as well. \"Dreamlover\", the seventh number one from the album, was the lead single from \"Music Box\". The song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for eight weeks and was described as a \"slight piece of pop fluff\", representing a more commercial side to Carey than the \"more ambitious\", \"Vision of Love\". The song was the start of a vocal maturity for Carey, and was considered a notable song in her career. The second single from \"Music Box\", \"Hero\", also made the album's final cut. According to author Chris Nickson, \"Hero\" was one of Carey's \"most inspirational ballads\". The album's third single, Carey's cover of Harry Nielsen's \"Without You\" failed to make the US album version, however, due to the song's popularity in Europe, it was included in the album's international edition.\n\n\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", the lead single from Carey's holiday album \"Merry Christmas\" also made the international track listing. The song became one of the best-selling singles by a non–Asian female, and the best-selling Japanese single of 1994, selling 1.1 million copies. Additionally, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was called \"one of the essential musical hallmarks of the holiday season\", and is the only holiday song and ringtone to reach multi-platinum status in the US. Occupying three of the thirteen number ones on the album were the singles from Carey's 1995 release, \"Daydream\". The album's lead single \"Fantasy\", was featured on \"#1's\". However, it was the song's official remix, which featured rap verses from Ol' Dirty Bastard, which made the album cut. This was a personal decision made by Carey, as it was of her preference. The second song from \"Daydream\" to be featured on the album was \"One Sweet Day\", Carey's duet with Boyz II Men. The song topped the Hot 100 for a then-unprecedented sixteen weeks, and held the record for longest running number one song in Hot 100 history until 2019. The third and final song from the album, \"Always Be My Baby\", spent two weeks atop the charts in the US, therefore earning a place on the album as well.\n\nCarey's most recent studio effort at the time, \"Butterfly\", also yielded two number one songs. The album's lead single, \"Honey\", was a career-transitional song for Carey, which introduced her as a hip hop soul artist, as well as featured extended rap verses throughout the song. While very different than anything Carey had ever recorded, the track was described as \"street Hip-Hop music, with a booming bass.\" The second song from \"Butterfly\", \"My All\", spent one week atop the charts. Carey described the song as \"[having] a lush sound and intense styling.\" Solely written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, \"My All\" featured guitar arpeggios, which were synthetically created with the clever use of sampling and playing keyboard notes. As a result, the song was well-received, being called a \"slinky, slow jam R&B sound, that fit Mariah like a glove.\"\n\nSince Carey intended \"#1's\" to serve as a sign of gratitude to her fans, the album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums. The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' \"Sweetheart\" (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album \"Daydream\", and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, \"I was thinking of the old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a really cute record. Young girls'll like it the way I liked it when I was growing up.\" Another new song featured on \"#1's\" was \"When You Believe\", which Carey said was included because she felt it was \"a miracle\" that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of \"All That Glitters\", Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song \"When You Believe\" for the soundtrack to the animated film \"The Prince of Egypt\". Carey and Houston were shown the film separately, and both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project. In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding \"When You Believe\" and working with Whitney Houston:\n\n\"It's sort of a message song. It's what 'Prince of Egypt' is about, Moses. If we were ever going to come together on any kind of record, this is definitely the right one, and really the coolest thing to me is that after all of the drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry, she was just really cool and we had a really good time in the studio. We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever.\"\n\nThe song was co-written by Stephen Schwartz and Babyface, who also produced the song. Carey had previously collaborated with Babyface on her albums, \"Music Box\" (1993) and \"Daydream\" (1995). Babyface expressed how he went through more than one version of the song and described its production as a beautiful movie ballad, something different than he, Carey or Houston ever recorded. In an interview with \"Vibe\", Carey said that she \"liked [the song] the way it was.\" She had characterised it as \"a very big ballad but in an inspirational way\" and denied speculation that there had been past rivalry or animosity between her and Houston prior to its recording: \"I never even really talked to her until this. We never had any issues between us. The media and everybody made it an issue.\"\nCarey co-wrote and co-produced the song \"Whenever You Call\" with longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff for her album, \"Butterfly\". However, in order to change the song's tempo and format, Carey decided to re-do the song as a duet with Brian McKnight, because she felt it was one of the best songs on \"Butterfly\". Carey had also expressed how McKnight's vocals added a great deal to the song, describing the project as \"perfecting the song\". McKnight shared similar sentiments, saying, \"It was amazing to go into the studio with someone who's so successful, and has that kind of track record. Mariah is someone who could ask anyone in the world to sing with her, and they called me. The album contains a duet with Whitney Houston ... it's just been great company to be in.\"\n\nOne of the songs Carey recorded specifically for \"#1's\" was a cover of Brenda K. Starr's \"I Still Believe\" (1988) co-produced by Stevie J and Mike Mason. During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote that the purpose of the song was solely paying tribute to her. According to Carey, the song \"reminds me of the fact that not long ago I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and my ability to write songs. Brenda K. Starr treated me like a 'star' and gave me a shot.\" Another song Carey and Stevie J co-produced was a cover of, \"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\" (1975) by Diana Ross. The latter song was the third non-original song on the album, and experienced a limited release throughout few countries in Europe. During a press release for the album, it was reported that an exclusive live version of \"Hero\" would be included. However, the idea fell through and was never released.\n\n\"When You Believe\", the album's lead single, was promoted as the first single from both \"The Prince of Egypt: Original Soundtrack\" and Houston's \"My Love Is Your Love\". It was given a wider release than \"Sweetheart\" and achieved worldwide success. The song peaked within the top two in Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, and in the top five in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom. In the UK, \"When You Believe\" became one of Carey's biggest successes, selling 260,000 units. Despite reaching high positions around the globe, \"When You Believe\" performed moderately in the US, where it peaked at number fifteen. Serving as the album's second single, \"I Still Believe\" performed stronger in the US than the album's previous singles, peaking at number four. The song was certified platinum in the United States, however performing weakly in other territories. \"I Still Believe\" performed well in Spain, where it peaked at number seven, and in Canada, where the song reached the top-ten.\n\n\"Whenever You Call\" was considered for release as a single in mid-1999, but its promotion was cancelled due to the impending release of \"Heartbreaker\", the lead single from Carey's following album \"Rainbow\".\n\n\"Sweetheart\" was released as single from Jermaine Dupri's debut album \"Life in 1472\" and later included on \"#1's\". In the US, due to the song's low radio airplay, \"Sweetheart\" only reached number twenty-five on \"<nowiki>Billboard'</nowiki>\"s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. Internationally, the song performed better, peaking within the top twenty in Germany and Switzerland. \"Do You Know Where You're Going To\" was issued as a promotional single in Brazil and some parts of Europe during June. The song performed weakly around the world, not charting in any major music market. In December 1999, Columbia released the video/DVD \"#1's\", which contained music videos and recordings of live performances for the number one singles featured on \"#1's\", as well as \"Heartbreaker\", which had gone to number one during that time.\n\nThe album received generally mixed reviews from music critics. \"#1's\" was awarded four and a half out of five stars from Heather Phares of AllMusic. Phares complimented the album's content, feeling the song selection was too commercial, but very strong. Additionally, Phares wrote \"Her career has been an extraordinary succession of number ones and record-breaking firsts in the music world, her entire album catalog has achieved RIAA multi-platinum status.\" Phares also commented on the accompanying DVD, writing, \"Interviews and interactive menus make #1s a better-than-average DVD video collection and one that will doubtlessly please Carey's legions of fans.\"\nMark Bautz, an editor from \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the album a B-. Bautz felt that Carey's primary limitation was \"wan, homogeneous songs\" and that \"hearing them months apart on the radio makes them passable, but strung together on #1s they're like a mile-long elevator ride.\" While criticizing the album for its song selection and content, he complimented the songs \"My All\" and the remix for \"Fantasy\", writing, \"that said, though, \"Fantasy\" (with O.D.B.) and \"My All\" stand up as two of the best pop tunes of the '90s.\" The album received a scathing review from Britain's \"NME\" magazine, with its critic writing:\n\n\"I fear Mariah Carey. Superficially, she might seem like a purveyor of saccharine bilge like 'Hero' ... But that's bullshit. You don't sell 90 million records unless you reserve that fluffybunny stuff for your sucker fans ... you gotta be cold-eyed, hard-boiled and have balls of steel ... She'll do whatever it takes. And her most fiendish weapon is the duet. If the MOR market needs servicing, she'll duet with Luther or Whitney ... If her contemporary edge needs sharpening, she'll hang with the Wu-Tang Clan ... If you're big in the R&B charts, like Brian McKnight, she'll be in there ... like a heat-seeking parasite. She don't give a fuck. She destroys competition by sucking them dry and spitting them out. [...] Mariah Carey is She Who Must Be Bought At All Costs. Be very afraid...\"\n\nIn a review for Carey's 2001 album, \"Greatest Hits\", Sal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" felt the album was solely a string of Carey's most commercial and popular hits, however, not her best. Cinquemani complimented \"Greatest Hits\" and wrote, \"It seems like only yesterday that we were served with the self-congratulatory #1s, a collection of Carey's record-breaking string of chart-toppers, but the 27-track Greatest Hits is the singer's first proper hits compilation.\" In his consumer guide for \"The Village Voice\", critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \"choice cut\" rating, indicating \"a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money; Some (choice cut)s are arbitrarily personal, others inescapably social.\" His \"choice cut\" was \"Fantasy\" (with O.D.B.)\n\nIn 1998, Carey received the World Music Awards for becoming the \"World's Best Selling Recording Artist of the 1990s\" as well as the award for \"World's Best Selling R&B Artist\". Carey received the 1998 Billboard Music Award for Artist of the Decade. At the 1999 BMI Music Awards, Carey took home the coveted Songwriter of the Year award. \"When You Believe\" was nominated at the 2000 Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Duo or Group. Additionally, the song won the award for Best Original Song at the 71st annual Academy Awards. After the album's release, Carey won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award in the category of Favorite Female Artist, and Entertainer of the Year at the Soul Train Music Awards. \"#1's\" won a 1999 Japan Gold Disc Award for International Pop Album of the Year.\n\nAs executives at Columbia had done during the album's development, Eric Boehlert of \"Rolling Stone\" noted the importance of the release date of \"#1's\" and other albums on sale during the same period: \"Artists who make a habit of hitting it big during the holiday shopping season are wise indeed, as sales traditionally skyrocket. This year is no exception.\" Journalist and author Marc Shapiro, in his biography of Carey, attributed the album's high sales to the presence of new songs, writing:\n\n\"The consensus among the music press was that Mariah's insistence on including the new material made all the difference in increasing sales figures more than expected. Including some new with the old in a greatest-hits package had been tried from time to time by other artists with varying degrees of success, but with the triumph of \"#1's\", it would become a regular element in nearly all future greatest-hits albums. As such packages go, \"#1's\" was a solid retrospective of Mariah's chart hits, but because these songs were oversaturating the radio, including a favorite nonhit album track or two might have made a nice change. The new songs were a definite bones even though none ever really rose to the spectacular level of her best ... they added up to a nice touch but little more.\"\n\n\"#1's\" was released in the same week as several other albums by high-profile musicians such as Garth Brooks, Jewel, Method Man, Ice Cube and Whitney Houston. MTV News called November 17 \"what is shaping up to be the music industry's Super Tuesday ... most onlookers know that first week sales aren't everything, but they will also tell you that they are pretty darn important.\"\n\"#1's\" entered the US \"Billboard\" 200 at number four, with 221,000 copies sold in its first week. In its sixth week of release (ending January 2) the album's weekly sales peaked at 360,000 copies. It remained in the top twenty for thirteen weeks and on the chart for sixty-two weeks (making two re-entries). In Canada, \"#1's\" was certified triple-platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), denoting shipments of 300,000 copies.\n\nIn Europe, the album experienced success, peaking within the top-ten in almost every major music market. By 2003, the album received a double-platinum certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), denoting shipments of two million copies throughout Europe, until that year. In France, \"#1's\" was certified double-platinum, with estimated sales of 800,000 copies. In Italy was certified triple-platinum, with 300,000 copies. The album received a platinum certification in Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where it shipped 800,000 copies. \"#1's\" received a gold certification in Germany, the Netherlands and Norway. Aside from its success in Europe, the album experienced its highest sales in Japan (after the US), where it sold 3,250,000 copies in the first three months after its release. In Japan, \"#1's\" remains the best-selling album in Japan by a non-Asian artist and is certified the triple-Million award. The album was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of five million copies throughout the United States. The album sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.\n\nNotes\n\nAdapted from the \"Number 1's\" liner notes.\n\nProduction\n\n\n"}

He attended the Technical highschool in Zagreb, and then the Technical Faculty of the University of Zagreb. His work experience included the chemical factories \"Radonja\" in Sisak, and \"Chromos\" in Zagreb, where he advanced to the positions of a technical director. He then became a high-ranking official of \"Astra\", a large state-owned company from Zagreb that exported to the Soviet Union, and Gregurić worked in Moscow for some time.\n\nIn the first democratic elections of 1990, Franjo Gregurić entered politics as a member of the Croatian Democratic Union. In the second Croatian government in 1990 he was a deputy prime minister. On 17 July 1991, he was appointed to the post of prime minister by President Franjo Tuđman.\n\nWhen he took his post, Croatia was in very difficult situation - its independence, declared on 25 June 1991, was not recognised by the international community and Croatia, unlike Slovenia, lacked proper military infrastructure to resist Krajina rebels backed by Yugoslav People's Army. Only few weeks later, following couple of disastrous setbacks for nascent and inexperienced Croatian military, his cabinet was reshuffled by introducing of members of other political parties represented in Croatian Parliament (with exception of Croatian Party of Rights).\n\nThis cabinet, later dubbed as \"Government of National Unity\", was in charge when major combat operations in Croatia ceased on 3 January 1992, following UN-sponsored armistice. On 15 January 1992 Croatian independence was recognised by major European countries.\n\nThis is hailed as the greatest achievement of Gregurić's cabinet, while Gregurić himself enjoyed favourable reputation because of his mild manners and managerial skills. His cabinet was often taken as a great example of national unity under difficult situation.\n\nThose achievements, however, must be taken into proper context. Foreign policy was in hands of Franjo Tuđman, while defence was in hands of Gojko Šušak and military officials responsible only to President. That left Gregurić with more mundane tasks like issuing first Croatian currency and setting up Croatian air traffic control and other institution previously in Yugoslav federal jurisdiction.\n\nWith war generally perceived to be over and with prospects of new elections, \"Government of National Unity\" began to fall apart. In February 1992 his government proposed the laws offering territorial autonomy to ethnic Serbs in Krajina in exchange for their formal recognition of Croatian sovereignty. Dražen Budiša, one of government's ministers and leader of Croatian Social Liberal Party, left the government in protest. This was followed by representative of other parties who gradually left the government.\n\nBy the end of his term, cabinet of Franjo Gregurić again had members of only one party.\n\nAt parliamentary elections of 1992, Gregurić was elected as representative of HDZ and remained in that party.\n\nGregurić was later the president of the Croatian Firefighting Association between 1993 and 2000.\n\nIn May 2010, Gregurić was appointed the head of the Supervisory board at Institut IGH.\n\n"}

It is not a public holiday in any of them. In some countries, it falls within Administrative Professionals Week (the last full week of April in the United States). The day recognizes the work of secretaries, administrative assistants, executive assistants, personal assistants, receptionists, client services representatives, and other administrative support professionals. Typically administrative professionals are given cards, flowers, chocolates, and lunches.\n\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was a shortage of skilled administrative personnel in the United States due to Depression-era birth-rate decline and booming post-war business. The National Secretaries Association, founded in 1942, was formed to recognize the contributions of administrative personnel to the economy, support their personal development, and to help attract workers to the administrative field. Key figures who created the holiday were the president of the National Secretaries Association, Mary Barrett; president of Dictaphone Corporation, C. King Woodbridge; and public relations account executives at Young & Rubicam, Harry F. Klemfuss and Daren Ball.\n\nThe National Secretaries Association's name was changed to Professional Secretaries International in 1981 and to the International Association of Administrative Professionals (IAAP) in 1998. \"Administrative Professionals Day\" is a registered trademark with registration number 2475334 (serial number 75/898930). The registrant is IAAP.\n\nThe official period of celebration was first proclaimed by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Charles W. Sawyer as \"National Secretaries Week\", which was held June 1–7 in 1952 with Wednesday, June 4 designated as National Secretaries' Day. The first Secretaries' Day was sponsored by the National Secretaries Association with the support of corporate groups.\n\nIn 1955, the observance date of National Secretaries Week was moved to the last full week of April, with Wednesday now designated as Administrative Professionals Day. The name was changed to Professional Secretaries Week in 1981 and became Administrative Professionals Week in 2000 to encompass the expanding responsibilities and wide-ranging job titles of administrative support staff in the modern economy. The week-long observance was created in order to space out the bookings at restaurants, country clubs, and other places where administrative professionals would be taken out to lunch.\n\nSome critics take an anti-consumerist stance and accuse the flower, card, and candy industries of inventing the holiday for convenient sales between Easter and Mother's Day, which is the second Sunday of May in the United States. It has also been argued that the typical gifts of flowers and cards unintentionally mark the holiday and the administrative role as a gendered one, since these are typically feminine gifts, and that a specific day to celebrate administrative staff \"ghettoizes\" and separates the administrative staff from the rest of their workplace peers.\n\n"}

Knowsley Safari Park is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).\nThe safari park contributes to conservation and research through links with conservation projects and its links with universities in Liverpool, Chester and Manchester.\n\nThe park was opened in July 1971 by Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby and Jimmy Chipperfield using the expertise of general manager Laurence Tennant MBE, formerly the Chief Game Warden of Parks in Uganda and Botswana. Initially the road through the park was , with visitors driving past lions, cheetahs, monkeys, giraffes, zebra, elephants and various antelope. Due to the popularity of this route, an additional of road was added in 1973, and camels, buffalo, white rhino, and tigers were added to the park. Over the years, a few modifications have been made. For instance, tigers are now displayed in enclosures within the reserve, and a bypass around the baboons was built for visitors who are worried about damage to their cars.\n\nThe park was also home to a former RAF airfield which closed at the end of World War II. The RAF airbase situated at the safari park was also known as No 49 SLG or RAF Knowsley Park and was in use between 13 May 1942 – November 1944.\n\nThe park has hosted several sporting events including the Olympic torch relay, watched by 6,000 children and families in June 2012. The park hosted the finish of Stage Two of the 2012 Tour of Britain cycling event and hosted Stage Three of the 2013 Tour in September of that year.\n\nMost recently it hosted the final leg of Big Learner Relay 2017 which has raised over £300,000 for the BBC Children in Need appeal since 2014. Louise Walsh the inspiration behind the BLR has been awarded the prime minister's points of light award which recognises outstanding individual volunteers.\n\nIn 1995 Mr William Middleton, a warden at the park, was crushed and paralysed due to a faulty elephant enclosure. Mr Middleton died 12 years later due to complications caused by his injuries.\n\nSituated around Knowsley Hall on the ancestral estate of the Earl of Derby, the reserve is home to many different animals including elephants, giraffes, lions, bongos, tigers and baboons. The Derby Estate have a tradition of keeping animals, ever since the famous artist and nonsense-poet Edward Lear was employed there in the 19th century to paint pictures of the Earl's collection.\n\nThe park is open to the public and customers drive around the park in their own vehicles. There is a bypass route past the baboons for those who wish to avoid the risk of the baboons damaging their cars. In 2009 the baboons made the news all over the world when a video was released showing how they were intelligent and curious enough to open car roofboxes.\n\nAmur Tiger Trail opened 25 May 2018, home to the Amur Tiger otherwise known as the Siberian Tiger. The area is 10,000m2 and includes forested areas, natural streams and ponds.\n\nThis exhibit focuses on animals who thrive in habitats around the Earth's Equator. The exhibit also houses the 'Equatorial Express', a small train which visitors can ride to gain a unique viewpoint of the animals. 4 completely different species of animals are housed in this exhibit, the South American tapir, Sitatunga, Rhea and the Capybara.\n\nUntil 2017 the park housed a herd of 4 adult cows named Tana, Ashanti, Nala and Juba. They were transported to Zoo Parc d'Beauval, France to enter the European Breeding Programme and allow for transformations on Knowsley Safari's Foot Safari. Knowsley previously housed a bull named Nissim, who collapsed in June 2014. Knowsley also recently lost their cow named Shaba due to a long battle with elephant arthritis.\n\nKnowsley's crash of 11 adult rhinos is one of the most successful and genetically diverse breeding groups in Europe. The latest calf (as at 4 June 2016), Nomvula (Mother of Rain – a reference to the recent wet weather), born to mum Meru and is the 19th to be born at the facility in the last 40 years. Nomvula is Meru's 6th calf and was born on 2 January 2016.\n\nThe Safari Drive is the park's main attraction and contains over 29 species of animals in 7 zones.\n\nThis zone contains: Père David's deer, Yak, Kiang and Bactrian camel.\n\nThis zone contains: Blackbuck, Nilgai, Eld's deer, Chital (Axis Deer) and Barasingha.\n\nZone 6 is over 100 acres and contains over a mile of road. It is one of Knowsley's two white rhino paddocks and is one of the largest in the UK. This zone contains: Southern White Rhino, Roan antelope, Eland, Lechwe, Wildebeest, Plains Zebra, African Forest Buffalo, Ostritch and Waterbuck.\n\nThis zone contains: Blesbok and Bongo\n\nThis zone contains exclusively the Olive baboon, which are famous for removing windscreen wipers and other appendages off vehicles. There is a car-friendly route which totally removes this zone however is still visible from outside the perimeter. This leads directly to zone 6.\n\nThis zone contains: European Bison, Fallow Deer and European Moose\n\nThis zone contains: Lion, and the Somali wild ass. This zone previously housed African wild dog, Iberian Wolf and Siberian Tiger.\n\nThe park features a gauge railway, 'The Lakeside Railway', on which visitors may tour parts of the site. There is also a collection of amusements and fairground rides on site plus paintballing, off-road driving challenges, and aerial extreme ropewalks.\n\nA baboon house was added in 2006, along with African wild dogs that same year, a lion and tiger house in 2007. Red river hogs and marmosets were also added to the walkaround section, as well as an outdoor pool.\n\nIn January 2011, local animal rights activists held a peaceful demonstration after an inspection by government vets found one instance of a breach of regulations on the disposal of animal ‘by-products’. Pictures in the Daily Mail showed animals lying dead on the ground and in binbags, although the park's directors claim the pictures were staged by the photographer, whose husband the paper claimed had recently lost his job at the park. The park has since installed an enclosure for the storage of animal carcasses before disposal. The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) later said it had ‘full confidence’ in Knowsley and praised its ‘excellent standards of animal husbandry and welfare’.\n\n"}
{"id": "1834630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834630", "title": "The Magnificent Marble Machine", "text": "The Magnificent Marble Machine\n\nThe Magnificent Marble Machine was an American television game show that featured a giant pinball machine as its centerpiece. The program premiered on NBC on July 7, 1975 at 12:00 pm ET, replacing the short-lived game show \"Blank Check\".\n\nMerrill Heatter and Bob Quigley packaged the program, with Robert Noah as executive producer. Art James served as host, and Johnny Gilbert was the announcer.\n\nTwo contestants competed, one a returning champion, each paired with a celebrity partner. In the first half of the game, the teams answered general knowledge questions, frequently involving puns or other wordplay, that were displayed on a large electronic marquee, similar to one found on a pinball's backbox display. The players were shown blanks on the display's bottom line denoting the number of words and letters in the answer. A clue then crawled across the display's upper line. If no team buzzed in once the clue was revealed, letters of the answer then filled in at random as time progressed. For example, with the clue \"He's center and he's square\", and blanks displaying \"#### #####\", the correct answer is \"Paul Lynde\". James occasionally gave an additional clue before the main clue scrolled across the marquee.\n\nFor any given question, only the contestant or the celebrity was eligible to buzz in. This alternated with each question, and was indicated by lighted panels in front of the eligible player. Correct answers each scored one point. Five points won the game, and the winning team played \"The Magnificent Marble Machine\" in the bonus round.\n\nThe winning team played the show's centerpiece: a giant pinball machine measuring 20 feet high and 12 feet long.\n\nEach team member manipulated one button, each of which controlled two flippers, and tried to keep the ball in play for as long as possible within a 60-second time limit. The team accumulated points by hitting bumpers, noisemakers and lights. Hitting any of the seven large numbered bumpers won the contestant a prize, with bumpers two and three together earning a larger prize, such as a car or trip. Play ended if the ball fell into one of the two \"out holes\" (one located below the main flippers, the other in the middle of the playing field). The flippers were disabled when 60 seconds expired, with the ball (still in play) usually entering an out hole within a few seconds.\n\nAt some point during the series, a bonus prize was added for hitting all seven numbered bumpers at least once.\n\nOriginally, each bumper scored 500 points while any noisemaker scored 200 points. Producers audited the score by watching the tape to ensure that each scoring feature had registered, but scoring errors increased week by week as the machine aged. The rules were eventually altered so that only the seven \"thumper bumpers\" added 500 points for each hit, with nothing else scoring.\n\nIf a team reached a target score after playing two balls, the team played a bonus \"gold money ball\" in which the player earned $200 for each noisemaker and bumper. The goal was originally 15,000 points for each new champion, and lowered by 1,000 for each return visit. Later, the goal started at 13,000 points, and the money ball earned $500 for each bumper hit.\n\nAt some point in the run, this round was redesigned to be a multi-player \"money ball marathon\" rather than a bonus round any player might be able to achieve in any one play of the machine. The contestant achieving the top point score over a two-week period was awarded a money ball round. This format lasted for five marathons (ten weeks), after which the money ball was dropped from the game altogether.\n\nAfter the money ball round was removed, the electronic point counters on the pinball machine were covered over. Contestants then only played for prizes obtained by hitting the seven bumpers.\n\nIn early 1976, game play changed to feature two teams of two celebrities each playing the front game. The winning team headed to the machine. One celebrity drew a name from the drum (filled out by the studio audience) and the lucky person played the bonus round with each celebrity.\n\n\"The Magnificent Marble Machine\" aired in its original time slot until November 28, 1975. On December 1, 1975, the series replaced \"Three for the Money\" at 12:30 PM so \"Wheel of Fortune\" could expand to an hour. With the move, \"Marble\" was reduced in length to 25 minutes as a national newscast anchored by Edwin Newman aired at 12:55.\n\nAfter the January 2, 1976 broadcast, the show was pulled from the schedule for a two-week trial run of \"Take My Advice\", a talk show hosted by KNBC news anchor Kelly Lange. When \"Marble\" returned on January 19, it changed to an all-celebrity format, which finally brought on its demise. While the last first-run episode aired March 12, its replacement, \"The Fun Factory,\" was postponed because of a technicians' strike, resulting in repeats airing through June 11.\n\nA brief clip from \"The Magnificent Marble Machine\" is seen in the 1979 film \"The China Syndrome\", as the \"regularly scheduled programming\" that the TV station interrupts to show the main character's report from inside the power plant. The clip shows celebrity guest Joan Rivers playing a normal ball on the machine, though the original audio is dubbed over with music composed for the film. The film's credits do not mention the show, Rivers or Heatter-Quigley.\n\n"}

From 1981 to 1989, he was a spokesman for the Council of Ministers. From April to September 1989, he was a minister without portfolio and chairman of the Polish Radio and Television. From 1990 is the editor-in-chief of the weekly \"NIE\" and the owner of the Urma publishing company.\n\nHe was born into an assimilated Polish-Jewish family in Łódź. His father was a journalist and activist of the Polish Socialist Party as well as the Bund.\n\nHe spent his early childhood in Łódź. He lived at 134 Piotrkowska Street, in a transverse outbuilding on the first floor. In the autumn of 1939 he moved with his family to Lviv. Jerzy's father received an engineer job at the State Institute of City Design. The whole family adopted Soviet citizenship. During this time, the family officially changed the name from \"Urbach\" to \"Urban\". After German invasion of the Soviet Union, they had to hide in the Eastern Borderlands. Initially, they stayed in the village of Budaniv near Terebovlia, later in Ternopil. From 1944 they lived first in Chełm, then in Lublin. They returned to Łódź at the beginning of 1945.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Jerzy Urban attended seventeen different primary and secondary schools. In 1948 he joined the Union of Polish Youth, of which he was an active member. From 1951 to 1954 he was studied journalism at the University of Warsaw, but did not graduate.\n\nIn 1951 he began journalistic career. In July 1955 he became a journalist of the weekly \"Po prostu\". From January 1956 he was the head of the political department. After the liquidation of the weekly, Urban was officially banned from publishing under his name. From 1961 he worked in \"Polityka\", when he wrote under Pseudonyms. In 1963 he was banned from working in journalism. After some time, Zenon Kliszko, who was then Gomułka's right hand, allowed him to take up a job provided he did not disclose himself. The ban on journalistic work for Jerzy Urban was officially withdrawn only after Władysław Gomułka's departure from power. After some time, despite remaining independent, he assumed the position of head of the national department of \"Polityka\".\n\nDespite his critical attitude towards Edward Gierek's rule, he was an opponent of the Solidarity movement in 1980 and often criticized its leaders (including Lech Wałęsa).\n\nFrom 1981 to 1989, he was a spokesman for the Council of Ministers. He created the tradition of weekly press conferences, transmitted by the Polish television and attended by both Polish and foreign journalists. Critizied the priest Jerzy Popiełuszko as an anti-communist Savonarola.\n\nIn 1986 Urban masterminded a media story that the United States had betrayed the Solidarity movement. He met with a Washington Post reporter and told him that a Polish spy for the CIA, who was later identified as Ryszard Kukliński, was aware of the plan to install martial law in 1981 and had passed that information on to Washington. \"The US administration could have publicly revealed these plans to the world and warned Solidarity,\" Urban said, \"Had it done so, the implementation of martial law would have been impossible.\" At press conference Urban alleged that \"Washington ... did not warn its allies. It did not boast of its agent as it customarily does.\" According to Urban, the Reagan administration had \"lied to its own people and to its friends in Poland,\" when it denied having prior knowledge of martial law.\n\nHe did not protest against the campaign against homosexuals in the 1980s. In 1986, when asked about the Operation Hyacinth in an interview with the American press, he denied that it ever took place.\n\nFrom April to September 1989, he was a minister without portfolio and chairman of the Polish Radio and Television.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1990, he was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party. In 1989 Polish legislative election he unsuccessfully ran for the Sejm as an independent candidate. He eventually obtained around 34,000 votes.

Currently it is the world's second highest concrete arch dam with a height of . It is located north of the town Jvari. It is part of the Enguri hydroelectric power station (HES) which is partially located in Abkhazia.\n\nSoviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev initially proposed a major dam and hydroelectric power scheme on the Bzyb River as his favourite resort was located near the mouth of the river at Pitsunda. However, his experts informed him that a dam built on the Bzyb River would have had catastrophic effects in causing beach erosion at Pitsunda, so in the end the dam was built on the Enguri River instead, where the impact upon the coastline was assessed to be considerably less pronounced.\n\nConstruction of the Enguri dam began in 1961. The dam became temporarily operational in 1978, and was completed in 1987. In 1994, the dam was inspected by engineers of Hydro-Québec, who found that the dam was \"in a rare state of dilapidation\". In 1999, the European Commission granted €9.4 million to Georgia for urgent repairs at the Enguri HES, including replacing the stoplog at the arch dam on the Georgian side and, refurbishing one of the five generators of the power station at the Abkhaz side. In total, €116 million loans were granted by the EBRD, the European Union, the Japanese Government, KfW and Government of Georgia. In 2011 The European Investment Bank (EIB) loaned €20 million in order to complete the rehabilitation of the Enguri hydropower plant and to ensure safe water evacuation towards the Black Sea at the Vardnili hydropower cascade.\n\nThe Enguri hydroelectric power station (HES) is a cascade of hydroelectric facilities including, in addition to the dam - diversion installation of the Enguri HES proper, the near-dam installation of the Perepad HES-1 and three similar channel installations of the Perepad HESs-2, -3, and -4 located on the tailrace emptying into the Black Sea. While the arch dam is located on the Georgian controlled territory in Upper Svanetia, the power station is located in the Gali District of region Abkhazia of Georgia. Enguri HES has 20 turbines with a nominal capacity of 66 MW each, resulting in a total capacity of 1,320 MW. Its average annual capacity is 3.8 TWh, which is approximately 46% of the total electricity supply in Georgia as of 2007.\n\nThe facility's arched dam, located at the town of Jvari, was inscribed in the list of cultural heritage of Georgia in 2015.\n\n"}

There are 15 URNUs nationwide in the UK, and each URNU has land-based facilities near the university in question, up to four training officers (members of the Royal Naval Reserve) and, with the exception of Devon, a dedicated training vessel (an \"Archer\"-class P2000 fast patrol boat).\n\nURNU ships are part of the 1st Patrol Boat Squadron, or \"1PBS\". 1PBS is commanded by Commander 1PBS, who previously was also Commander URNU (however Commander Universities is now a separate post). The mission statement of 1PBS is to provide high-quality sea training experiences in support of the URNU mission and to deliver P2000 operational capability in support of other fleet tasking.\n\nThe most recently formed unit, Devon URNU was established in 2017, catering to universities across the region. The unit is the only URNU without a dedicated training vessel, but students are able to utilise available P2000s and other craft for training. Devon was the first new unit formed since 1994.\n\nWhile the URNUs are commanded by Commander URNU they fall under the overall jurisdiction of Captain BRNC (the Commanding Officer of Britannia Royal Naval College), Dartmouth. Each URNU is commanded by a Lieutenant RN, Lieutenant Commander or RM Captain, and is associated with a P2000 patrol boat of the 1st Patrol Boat Squadron. Each URNU comprises 51 undergraduates who join for the duration of their degree, with the option of taking years out or leaving at any time.\n\nUndergraduates join for three years, or in some cases the duration of their course. Members hold the rank of honorary Midshipman in the Royal Naval Reserve. A notable difference between this and other ranks in the Royal Navy is that there is no call-up liability and members may leave at any time.\n\nDuring the first year URNU students wear URNU slides on their shoulders and are Officer Cadets (O/CDTS) and on completion of their first URNU taskbook they receive a white officer cadet tab in addition to the URNU slide. They can then be referred to as Officer Cadet OC RNR and on completion of the second taskbook students will wear Midshipman rank slides and \"turnbacks\" and be referred to as Midshipmen RNR(MID).\n\nEach URNU has a Senior Midshipman (SMID) and Deputy Senior Midshipman (DSMID) with a committee made up of various roles which differ according to unit, but will generally include a treasurer and sports and adventurous training officers alongside other roles, and this committee will take leading role in programme planning and assist in the running of the Unit. The committee is supported by the unit CO and a Coxn, usually a full-time Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer (CPO) as well as a civilian secretary. Each unit also has capacity for up to four training officers, who may be ex-Navy, former URNU students, or civilians with relevant experience, who are appointed as Royal Naval Reserve officers (RNR).\n\nTraining focuses on leadership, navigation and seamanship, and this is put into practice during sea weekends, and longer deployments during the summer and Easter vacations. Drill nights also often include lessons on wider navy knowledge, drill practice, and visits from serving personnel and affiliated units as well as practical leadership tasks and team building. Units also frequently undertake visits to affiliated units and local training establishments to experience military life first hand. Training is assessed via successive taskbooks which must be signed off by members of the unit staff or P2000 ships company. Advancement in rank depends on completion of each taskbook.\n\nThere is also a significant and important social element to URNU life from formal mess dinners including the main naval formal event of the year, Trafalgar Night, to informal socialising in the unit's mess and dedicated socials which contribute to unit integration and may be coordinated by a dedicated social secretary.\n\nThere are sporting activities held within the URNU units, informal contests between the units and an annual sports weekend in Portsmouth between all units, organised by the losing unit from the previous year.\n\n"}
{"id": "1834650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834650", "title": "Criterion Games", "text": "Criterion Games\n\nCriterion Games is a British video game developer based in Guildford. Founded in January 1996 as a division of Criterion Software, it was owned by Canon Inc. until Criterion Software was sold to Electronic Arts in October 2004. Many of Criterion Games' titles were built on the RenderWare engine, which Criterion Software developed. Notable games developed by Criterion Games include racing video games in the \"Burnout\" and \"Need for Speed\" series. As of April 2017, Criterion Games employ approximately 90 people.\n\nDavid Lau-Kee, the founder and leader of Canon Inc.'s European research arm, established Criterion Software as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canon in December 1993 and assumed the managing director role for it. At the time, Canon was seeking to establish a multimedia tool development business, while Lau-Kee had been working on interactive 2D image process techniques and was looking to extend this to 3D image processing and, in turn, \"out-and-out\" 3D graphics. Adam Billyard, who served as its chief technology officer, is also credited as a co-founder. Criterion Software's 3D texture mapping and rendering programme, RenderWare, was first released in 1993 as a software library for the C programming language and was adopted by 800 companies worldwide by October 1996. The firm also provided a demo game, \"CyberStreet\", while fully-fledged games were developed by companies like 47Tek. Meanwhile, competitor Argonaut Software developed full games—including \"FX Fighter\" and \"Alien Odyssey\"–to showcase its BRender technology. In response, Criterion Software hired new staff through a 1995 recruitment drive to establish a dedicated game development division. To supported this expansion, Criterion Software moved to new offices within Guildford in late 1995. The division, Criterion Studios, was established in January 1996 and announced the month thereafter, at the time employing 25 people. The headcount expanded to around 35 by October.\n\nRenderWare was thereafter gradually retooled as a game development programme, with its third iteration, released in 2000, first providing full game engine capabilities. The first game to use this version was \"Burnout\", which Criterion Studios developed in-tandem. Publishing rights to the game were sold to Acclaim Entertainment, while Criterion Studios retained the intellectual property to the brand and technology. Acclaim published \"Burnout\" (2000) and its sequel, \"\" (2002), which accumulated around 2 million sales. Despite this, Acclaim lacked the resources to market them in the United States, its home territory, leading to poor sales in the country. At the same time, Criterion Studios (now named Criterion Games) was frequently approached by Electronic Arts (EA), which eventually signed with Criterion Games for the third release in the series, \"\" (2004).\n\nIn July 2004, EA announced that it had reached an agreement with Canon's European arm, Canon Europe, to acquire all of the Criterion Software group, including Criterion Games. The deal was finalised on 19 October 2004, with EA paying . After the purchase, both Criterion and Electronic Arts declared that RenderWare would continue to be made available to third-party customers. However, some clients decided it was too risky to rely on technology owned by a competitor. Electronic Arts have since withdrawn RenderWare from the commercial middleware market, although remnants are still used by internal developers. In mid-2006, the company closed its Derby satellite office, making all of its programmers and support staff redundant. In early March 2007, Electronic Arts combined its Chertsey-based UK development studio and Criterion Games into a new building in central Guildford. Integration of the teams did not occur and the location housed two very separate development studios: Criterion Games and EA Bright Light before Bright Light was shut permanently in 2011. In November 2007, co-founder and CEO David Lau-Kee made the decision to leave Electronic Arts to concentrate on advisory activities within the games industry. Adam Billyard also left Electronic Arts as CTO of EATech in 2007 to pursue other projects. \n\nOn 14 June 2010, Criterion announced that \"\" was set for release in November 2010. The software utilises a new game engine named Chameleon. On 1 June 2012, Electronic Arts announced Criterion's second \"Need for Speed\" title, \"\", which was released on 30 October 2012. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, Criterion Games announced that it had taken sole ownership of the \"Need for Speed\" franchise.\n\nOn 28 April 2013, Alex Ward announced via Twitter that the studio is planning to steer away from its tradition in developing racing games and are instead focusing on other genres for future projects. On 13 September 2013, Criterion elected to cut its staff numbers to 17 people total, as 80% (70 people) of the studio moved over to Ghost Games UK to work with \"Need for Speed\" games.\n\nOn 3 January 2014, it was announced that Alex Ward and Fiona Sperry left Criterion to found a new studio, Three Fields Entertainment. Their first game \"Dangerous Golf\", slated for release in May 2016, combined ideas from \"Burnout\" and \"Black\" and is to lead them throws a spiritual successor to \"Burnout\". At the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, the company announced a new racing project. However, the project was cancelled as Criterion is now focusing on providing additional support to other EA studios in creating future \"Star Wars\" games. Criterion worked on \"Star Wars Battlefront: X-Wing VR Mission\", a new virtual reality mission for \"Star Wars Battlefront\".\n\nIn June 2015, news site Nintendo Life reveals that in early 2011 Nintendo of Europe approached Criterion to work on a pitch for a new \"F-Zero\" game which they hoped to unveil at E3 that same year alongside the then-unreleased Wii U console, and potentially release the game during the console's launch period. However, the developer was unable to handle the pitch as, at the time, they devoted much of their resources into the development of \"\" for multiple platforms. The site was tipped by an anonymous, yet \"reliable\" source, but they had confirmed this information when Criterion co-founder Alex Ward (who left the company in 2014) admitted that Nintendo of Europe did indeed approach the company for a potential \"F-Zero\" game on the Wii U. Alex Ward also noted on Twitter that Criterion was also offered the opportunity to work on the first \"Forza\", \"Mad Max\", a Vauxhall only racer, a \"Command & Conquer\" first-person shooter and a \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" game. In 2020, it was announced that Criterion will be returning as the main developer of the \"Need for Speed\" series.\n\n\"GamesIndustry.biz\" named Criterion Games among the \"best places to work in the UK video games industry\" in the \"Best Mid-sized Companies\" category in 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n"}
{"id": "1834651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834651", "title": "Klopotec", "text": "Klopotec\n\nA klopotec (pronounced ) is a wooden mechanical device on a high wooden pole, similar to a windmill. It is used as a bird scarer in the vineyards of traditional wine-growing landscapes of Slovenia, Austria, and Croatia. It is one of the symbols of Slovenia and Styria. \n\nThe windmill in the Slovene Hills typically has four blades, and in Haloze six blades, driving an axis with a sail or vane that is constructed to swivel so it is always positioned perpendicular to the wind. As the axis rotates, wooden hammers are lifted off their resting position by fixed notches. As they fall back, they rhythmically impact on a wooden board. While the quality of the sound is dependent on the wood of which the hammers and sounding boards are made of, the rattle frequency depends on the number of hammers, as well as changes in wind speed.\n\nThe device is used primarily to scare starlings and other birds off the vineyards so that they do not peck grapes. A folk belief also states that klopotecs drive snakes from the vineyards and soften grapes. In Catholic folk music of its region of origin, it is sometimes combined with an organ stop and used as a rural church instrument (e.g. in Gleisdorf parish church).\n\nThe device has many names. In Slovene it is called \"klopotec\" and in some dialects \"klapoc\". Both words derive from \"klopotati\", that is to produce cut off, rhythmic sounds. In German it is called \"Windradl\" or \"Windmühle\"; ever increasing is the use of the word \"Klapotetz\" and also \"Klapotez\". In English it could be described as a \"bird-scaring rattle\", a \"wind-rattle\" or a \"wind-clapper\".\n\nAlthough a local historian from Maribor claims that the device appeared in Haloze and in Zagorje already in the 16th century, nothing particular is known about its origin. An educated guess has been made that it developed during the period of the Enlightenment. According to the most plausible theory held by the majority of ethnologists, including the German ethnologist Leopold Kretzenbacher, the bird-scaring rattle is of Slovene origin. Another theory claims that it was first used in the 18th century in the fields by the French. \n\nThe first written mentions of klopotec date to the second half of the 18th century, whereas its oldest depictions date to the first half of the 19th century. The device is also mentioned in the oldest Slovene social poem, \"Lamentation of a Winedresser\", written in 1797 by Leopold Volkmer. Archduke Johann of Austria (1782–1859), the youngest brother of the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, had it in his vineyard in 1836.\n\nStill earlier than this, however, is the mention of the Klappermühle in German writings from at least the 16th century, which could signify either a true mill intentionally designed to scare birds away especially from fruit trees, or a smaller windmill-like device similar to the klopotec.\n\nA klopotec consists of different parts, each of which should (ideally) be made of a specific type of wood to produce a fine and melodic sound. The wood of hammers and of the board is especially important, as only the right combination enables that the device produces the ultrasound that scares the birds away. The parts are:\n\nThe largest construction of this type in a natural setting stands in the Sausal mountain range, near the summit of the Demmerkogel. It is 16 meters high, and its moving parts mass 3.4 metric tons. Each of the eight hammers weighs 40 kilograms.\n\nThe klopotec is most frequently heard in the transnational region from Southwest Styria (e.g., the Sausal mountain range and the Weinstraße) to Eastern Slovenia: the Slovene Hills, Haloze and Prlekija (of which it is a symbol), less frequently in Lower Carniola and White Carniola. It is also found in Southwestern Slovenia, in the Littoral Region and in Croatia's Zagorje region. These areas traditionally produce white wines.\n\nTraditionally such rattles have been set up on 25 July (Feast of Saint James) or on 15 August (Assumption Day), but also on any day in between. They have usually been taken down after the vintage till 1 November (All Saints Day), but no later than on 11 November (Feast of Saint Martin). If a husbandman forgets to take it down, the youth from the village can steal it and leave a message about the ransom that he must pay to get it back. \n\nSome of these bird-rattle devices are ornamented with small carved figurines. The traditional types which are made solely from wood are becoming more and more rare, as they are getting replaced by devices with metal elements.\n\n\n"}

He was married to the Naiad nymph Cleocharia and became the father of several sons, including Myles and Polycaon. Some call his wife Peridia, and his children Myles, Polyclon, Bomolochus, and Therapne. \n\nIn other traditions, again, Lelex is described as a son of Spartus, and as the father of Amyclas.\n\nThrough Myles, Lelex was the grandfather of Eurotas who had a daughter named Sparta. This woman later marry Lacedaemon who named the city of Sparta after his wife; however, the city's name would also be his own, as it was called either Lacedaemon or Sparta interchangeably.\n\nSources indicate that Perseus is a descendant of Lelex. Lelex’s great-granddaughter Sparta gave birth to a daughter named Eurydice who had married Acrisius, the king of Argos. Eurydice became the mother of Danaë, thus making her Perseus’ grandmother.\n\nLelex appears to have been conceived by ancient mythographers as the eponymous founder of the Leleges, a semi-mythical people who lived on both sides of the Aegean Sea.

It is defined in the \"Airman's Guide\" by Boone Nicolls as a \"special program where noncommisioned officers of a command recognize individuals they hold in high esteem and wish to honor. Those selected for induction are usually honored during a formal ceremony at a dining-in.\"\n\nSeveral honorees have been controversial, including Gen Merrill McPeak and Gen Robert H. Foglesong.\n\nVarious webpages originating with the U.S. Air Force claim an ancient origin for this order:\n\nThe Order of the Sword recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to the enlisted corps. Only seven other individuals have been so honored since 1978. The ceremonial presentation was adopted from the Royal Order of the Sword and passed to the United States during the Revolutionary War. However, it lay dormant until it was reinstituted in its current form in 1967.\n\nThe original order of the sword was patterned after two orders of chivalry founded during the Middle Ages in Europe: the (British) Royal Order of the Sword and the Swedish Military Order of the Sword, still in existence today. In 1522, King Gustavus I of Sweden ordered the noblemen commissioned by him to appoint officers to serve him, and these people became known as the noncommissioned officers.\n\nAny \"(British) Royal Order of the Sword\" appears unknown to relevant reference works (such as the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"), and Britain was not a single kingdom in the Middle Ages. A \"Swedish Military Order of the Sword\" matching the description is not mentioned in Swedish reference works. The Royal Swedish Order of the Sword, is a Swedish order of chivalry and was founded in 1748 by king Frederick I (two centuries after the reign of Gustavus I of Sweden), and all grades were limited to commissioned officers until 1850, when two affiliated decoration was established, the \"Medal of the Sword\" (\"Svärdsmedaljen\") for enlisted men and the \"Insignia of the Sword\" (\"Svärdstecknet\") for non-commissioned officers. The Swedish order was made dormant in 1975, and as such it is no longer awarded.\n\nSource:\n"}

A convinced communist, he defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, where he continued his research on the decay of the muon and on neutrinos. The prestigious Pontecorvo Prize was instituted in his memory in 1995.\n\nThe fourth of eight children of a wealthy Jewish-Italian family, Pontecorvo studied physics at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", under Fermi, becoming the youngest of his Via Panisperna boys. In 1934 he participated in Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission. He moved to Paris in 1934, where he conducted research under Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he joined the French Communist Party, as did his sisters Giuliana and Laura and brother Gillo. The Italian Fascist regime's 1938 racial laws against Jews caused his family members to leave Italy for Britain, France and the United States.\n\nWhen the German Army closed in on Paris during the Second World War, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria fled the city on bicycles. He eventually made his way to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he applied his knowledge of nuclear physics to prospecting for oil and minerals. In 1943, he joined the British Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. This became part of the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic bombs. At Chalk River Laboratories, he worked on the design of the nuclear reactor ZEEP, the first reactor outside of the United States that went critical in 1945, followed by the NRX reactor in 1947. He also looked into cosmic rays, the decay of muons, and what would become his obsession, neutrinos. He moved to Britain in 1949, where he worked for the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.\n\nAfter his defection to the Soviet Union in 1950, he worked at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna. He had proposed using chlorine to detect neutrinos. In a 1959 paper, he argued that the electron neutrino () and the muon neutrino () were different particles. Solar neutrinos were detected by the Homestake Experiment, but only between one third and one half of the predicted number were found. In response to this solar neutrino problem, he proposed a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation, whereby electron neutrinos became muon neutrinos. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998. He also predicted in 1958 that supernovae would produce intense bursts of neutrinos, which was confirmed in 1987 when Supernova SN1987A was detected by neutrino detectors.\n\nPontecorvo was born on 22 August 1913 in Marina di Pisa, the fourth of eight children of Massimo Pontecorvo and his wife Maria . His older brother Guido, who was born in 1907, became a geneticist. His brother Paolo, who was born in 1909, became an engineer who worked on radar during World War II. His older sister Giuliana was born in 1911. His younger brother Gillo was born in 1919, and is best known as the director of \"The Battle of Algiers\". He also had two younger sisters; Laura, who was born in 1921, and Anna, who was born in 1924, and a younger brother Giovanni, who was born in 1926. His was a wealthy family; Massimo owned three textile factories employing over 1,000 people. The family was Jewish and non-observant, from Rome on his father's side and from Mantua - on the mother's. His grandfather on maternal side, Arrigo Maroni (1852–1924), born in Mantua, was director of the Fatebenefratelli Hospital in Milan; the mother's cousin was a notable zoologist Elisa Gurrieri-Norsa (1868-1939).\n\nHe enterered the University of Pisa intending to study engineering, but after two years he decided to switch to physics in 1931. On the advice of his brother Guido, he decided to study at the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", where Enrico Fermi had gathered together a group of promising young scientists known as the Via Panisperna boys after the name of the street where the Institute of Physics of Rome University was then situated. At the age of 18 he was admitted to the third year of Physics. Fermi described Pontecorvo as \"scientifically one of the brightest men with whom I have come in contact in my scientific career\". As their youngest member, the group nicknamed him \"Cucciolo\", which means \"puppy\".\n\nIn 1934, Pontecorvo contributed to Fermi's famous experiment showing the properties of slow neutrons that led the way to the discovery of nuclear fission. Pontecorvo's name was included on the Via Panisperna boys' patent \"To increase the production of artificial radioactivity with neutron bombardment\". He was made a temporary assistant at the Royal Institute of Physics on 1 November 1934 and the University of Rome, and on 7 November, he was listed as co-author, along with Fermi and Rasetti, of a landmark paper on slow neutrons that reported that hydrogen slowed neutrons more than heavy elements, and that slow neutrons were more easily absorbed. An Italian patent was granted for the process in October 1935, in the name of Fermi, Pontecorvo, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti and Emilio Segrè. A US patent was granted on 2 July 1940.\n\nIn February 1936, Pontecorvo left Italy and moved to Paris to work in the laboratory of Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the Collège de France on a one-year scholarship to study the effects of collisions of neutrons with protons and on the electromagnetic transitions among isomers. During this period, influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he adopted the ideals of communism to which he remained loyal for the rest of his life. He formed a relationship with Helene Marianne Nordblom, a Swedish woman working in Paris as a nanny. Whether because of his relationship with Marianne, his interesting work on isomers, or the deteriorating political situation in Italy, he turned down an opportunity in 1937 to apply for a tenured position at the University of Rome to stay in Paris.\n\nMarianne moved in with Pontecorvo at the \"Hôtel des Grands Hommes\" on the \"Place du Panthéon\" on 4 January 1938. Their son, Gil, was born on 30 July. Her visa expired, and she had to return to Sweden in September. Pontecorvo accompanied her, leaving Gil behind in a residential nursery in Paris. Travelling back to Paris alone, he dined with Manne Siegbahn and met with Niels Bohr and Lisa Meitner on 12 October 1938. Pontecorvo was now unable to return to Italy because of the Fascist regime's racial laws against the Jews. This caused the breakup of the Via Panisperna boys, with Fermi moving to the United States. Pontecorvo's family also dispersed. Guido moved to Britain in 1938, followed by Giovanni, Laura and Anna in 1939, while Gillo joined Pontecorvo in Paris.\n\nWorking in collaboration with the French physicist André Lazard at Joliot-Curie's laboratory at Ivry-sur-Seine, Pontecorvo discovered what Frédéric Joliot-Curie called \"nuclear phosphorescence\"; the emission of X-rays when neutrons and protons were excited and returned to their ground state. He also discovered that some isomers do not change into other elements on decaying radioactively. This expanded the scope for their use in medical applications. For this ground-breaking research, Pontecorvo received a Curie-Carnegie scholarship, and funding for his work from the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\n\nIn June 1939, Pontecorvo applied for a visa to visit Sweden, but his application was rejected. On 23 August came the news of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. He joined the French Communist Party the next day as an affirmation of his personal faith in the Soviet Union. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after the British and French declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.\n\nAs the Germans closed in on the city in May 1940, they decided to leave. Although the British offered refuge to French nuclear scientists, including Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, they regarded Pontecorvo as an \"undesirable\". Fortunately, Segrè had been given an offer of employment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by two European expatriates who were looking for an expert on neutron physics. Segrè had turned down the offer — he already had a good job at the University of California — but recommended Pontecorvo.\n\nOn 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil off with their chattels on a train to Toulouse, where his sister Giuliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, just a day before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, from whence he eventually made his way to the United States. Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Giuliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to Lisbon via Madrid on 19 July 1940. Both women were pregnant. Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner \"Quanza\" on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached New York City, where they stayed with his brother Paolo. While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in Leonia, New Jersey.\n\nIn Tulsa, Pontecorvo went to work for two European migrants, Jakov \"Jake\" Neufeld and Serge Alexandrovich Scherbatskoy, who had founded a company called Well Surveys with funds provided by Standard Oil. Their idea was to apply nuclear physics to searching for minerals. A gamma ray device had been successful at analysing rock outcroppings. Inspired by the work done in Italy and France, they reasoned that neutrons, being without electrical charge, might be able to detect different elements beneath the surface by inducing radioactivity on the rocks. In Pontecorvo, they had the expert they needed.\n\nPontecorvo created a neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with paraffin wax as a neutron moderator, and measured the absorption of different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application of the discovery of slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.\n\nBy late 1941, Pontecorvo was having difficulty securing the radioisotopes that he needed. Unbeknown to him, the Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to build atomic bombs, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.\n\nThe meeting with Fermi yielded no supplies, but it did result in Pontecorvo receiving an offer from von Halban and Placzek to join the Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. There was some concern from Sir Edward Appleton over his appointment, not because of Pontecorvo's political beliefs, but on account of the fact that he was not a British national, and there were already a large number of foreign scientists working on Tube Alloys. Appleton was ultimately persuaded due to Pontecorvo's reputation, and the fact that good physicists were in short supply. Pontecorvo was officially appointed to Tube Alloys on 15 January 1943, and arrived in Montreal with his family on 7 February 1943. The Montreal team designed a nuclear reactor using heavy water as a neutron moderator, but lacked the quantity of heavy water needed. In August 1943, Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between the United States and Great Britain, merging Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project.\nJohn Cockcroft became director of the Montreal Laboratory in 1944. For safety reasons, he decided to build the reactor at the remote Chalk River Laboratories. With an eye on a post-war nuclear program, he had Pontecorvo and Allan Nunn May \"debrief\" Manhattan Project scientists who visited Canada, in practice spying for Britain. Unfortunately, Nunn May was also a Soviet spy. Pontecorvo's second son was born on 20 March 1944, and was named Tito after the Yugoslavian communist leader. A third son, Antonio, was born in July 1945. With heavy water supplied by the United States, the reactor at Chalk River, known as ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945. In addition to reactor design, Pontecorvo also looked into cosmic rays, the decay of muons, and what would become his obsession, neutrinos. He wrote 25 papers related to reactor design, although only two were published. He also did some prospecting with his old firm, searching for uranium deposits near Port Radium in the Northwest Territories.\n\nPhysicists were in great demand after the war ended in August 1945, and Pontecorvo received attractive and lucrative offers from several universities in the United States. Instead, on 21 February 1946, he accepted an offer from Cockcroft to join the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE). For the time being, he remained at Chalk River for the commissioning of the new NRX reactor in 1947. He was one of four physicists present in the control room when the NRX was started up on the night of 21–22 July 1947. At the time, it had five times the neutron flux of any other reactor, and was the most powerful research reactor in the world. He acquired the nickname \"Ramon Novarro\" after the actor of that name following an adventure in which he made a trip to Boston with two women, which culminated in Marianne clearing out the bank account and departing for Banff with the children; but they were reconciled. Although he had previously taken steps to become a United States citizen, he instead became a British subject on 7 February 1948. He finally departed Chalk River for the United Kingdom on 24 January 1949.\n\nAt Harwell, Pontecorvo continued to be involved in reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Giuliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell colleague Klaus Fuchs was arrested for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously, and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he did feel that he was a security risk, and recommended that he be moved to a position where he did not have access to Top Secret material. Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.\n\nOn 1 September 1950, in the middle of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo abruptly flew from Rome to Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing friends or relatives. On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.\n\nIn 1952, Pontecorvo's potential role in the transfer of nuclear secrets to Russia was discussed in American newspapers.\n\nAccording to Oleg Gordievsky, the highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy director of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied that he was a spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had made their way to the Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.\n\nIn the USSR Pontecorvo was welcomed with honours and given a number of privileges reserved only to the Soviet nomenklatura. He worked until his death in what is now the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, concentrating entirely on theoretical studies of high energy particles and continuing his research on neutrinos and decay of muons. In recognition of his research he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1953, membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1955 and the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1958, and two Orders of Lenin. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 for his work on the weak interaction. He began a lifelong affair with Rodam Amiredzhibi, the wife of poet Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov, in 1950. In 1955, he appeared in public at a press conference where he explained to the world the motivations of his choice to leave the West and work in the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Kingdom revoked his British citizenship on 24 May 1955. Pontecorvo was not permitted to leave the Soviet Union for many years; his first trip abroad being in 1978 when he travelled to Italy for celebrations of Amaldi's 70th birthday. Thereafter, he made frequent trips to Italy, and occasional visits to other countries. France refused to allow him to visit in 1982 and 1984, but relented in 1989.\n\nThe scientific work of Pontecorvo is full of formidable intuitions, some of which have represented milestones in modern physics. Much of this involved the neutrino, a subatomic particle first proposed theoretically by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 in order to explain undetected energy that escaped during beta decay so that the law of conservation of energy was not violated. Fermi named it the neutrino, Italian for \"little neutral one\", and in 1934, proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. Initially neutrinos were thought to be undetectable, but in 1945 Pontecorvo noted that a neutrino striking a chlorine nucleus could transform it into unstable argon-37 that emits, with a 34 days half-life, after a K-capture reaction, a 2.8 keV Auger electron allowing its direct detection:\n\nPontecorvo's 1945 paper credits the idea using carbon tetrachloride (CCl) to the French physicist Jules Guéron. Experiments were conducted at Chalk River using the NRX as a neutrino source, but were unsuccessful, and were abandoned in 1949, after Pontecorvo had left. The experiment was unsuccessful because, unknown at the time, nuclear reactors produced antineutrinos instead of neutrinos. In what is now known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected antineutrinos in 1955, for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.\n\nThe idea was taken up again in the search for solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun produced neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton–proton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time, scientists contemplated the awful possibility that the Sun might have burned out.\n\nThe problem had already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a powerful accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the weak interaction through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions that had never been observed should occur, but conceded that this was only true if the neutrinos associated with electrons were the same as those associated with muons.\n\nIn a 1959 paper, Pontecorvo listed 21 interactions that could not occur unless the electron neutrino () and the muon neutrino () were one and the same. This paper introduced this notation for neutrinos, which we use today, and listed the reasons why he felt that having two types of neutrinos was \"attractive from the point of view of symmetry and the classification of particles\". The prediction that neutrinos associated with electrons are different from those associated with muons was confirmed in 1962. In 1988 Jack Steinberger, Leon M. Lederman and Melvin Schwartz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the muon neutrino.\nPontecorvo's solution to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This was the idea that neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.\n\nThis prediction was recognised by the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics, awarded to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur B. McDonald \"for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass\". Pontecorvo also predicted in 1958 that supernovae would produce intense bursts of neutrinos. Few scientists were more excited when Supernova SN1987A was detected by neutrino detectors.\n\nPontecorvo died in Dubna on 24 September 1993, afflicted by Parkinson's disease. In accordance with his wishes, half of his ashes were buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, and another half in Dubna in Russia. In 1995, in recognition of his scientific merits, the prestigious Pontecorvo Prize has been instituted by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The prize, awarded annually to an individual scientist, recognises \"the most significant investigations in elementary particle physics\", as acknowledged by the international scientific community. In 2006, Moscow historical society Moskultprog unveiled an artistic plaque celebrating Pontecorvo's Moscow house at 9 Tverskaya Street.\n\n\n"}

He was a dual citizen of both Croatia and of France, as he spent 24 years in France, from 1963 to 1987. After the first democratic elections in Croatia, he joined the government of Franjo Tuđman and became head of his personal office.\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections of 1992 he, as member of Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), was appointed to the post of prime minister.\n\nHis cabinet, like all in Tuđman years, was less concerned with foreign policy and war and more with domestic issues. One of those issues was privatisation of state-owned companies. During his time many of the most controversial events of that process took place, including the now infamous takeover of Slobodna Dalmacija in early 1993.\n\nBy that time Croatian economy continued to decline, Šarinić himself became immensely unpopular and even his native Primorje-Gorski Kotar County rejected HDZ at local elections in February 1993. All that, together with escalating war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, led Tuđman to replace him with Nikica Valentić in April 1993.\n\nŠarinić was not demoted, however. He continued to serve as Tuđman's close advisor and was, for a while, head of Croatian security services.\n\nHe remained in public spotlight because of his diplomatic missions and frequent negotiations with Slobodan Milošević.

In 2000 he joined and was briefly active with the newly formed Democratic Centre.\n\nŠarinić died on 21 July 2017 in Zagreb at the age of 82.\n\nHe was buried at Mirogoj, Zagreb, five days after his death, on July 26, 2017.\n\n"}

This has a higher melting point than the actinide metals. Uranium dioxide resists corrosion in water and provides a stable matrix for many of the fission products; however, to prevent fission products (such as the noble gases) from leaving the uranium dioxide matrix and entering the coolant, the pellets of fuel are normally encased in tubes of a corrosion-resistant metal alloy (normally Zircaloy for water-cooled reactors).\n\nThose elements are then assembled into bundles to allow good handling and cooling. As the fuel fissions, the radioactive fission products are also contained by the cladding, and the entire fuel element can then be disposed of as nuclear waste when the reactor is refueled.\n\nIf, however, the cladding is damaged, those fission products (which are not immobile in the uranium dioxide matrix) can enter the reactor coolant or storage water and can be carried out of the core, into the rest of the primary cooling circuit, increasing contamination levels there.\n\nIn the EU, some work has been done in which fuel is overheated in a special research reactor named PHEBUS. During these experiments the emissions of radioactivity from the fuel are measured and afterwards the fuel is subjected to Post Irradiation Examination to discover more about what happened to it.\n"}

He is known for being a regular presenter at multiple hacking conferences, but is best known as the creator of the \"Binary Revolution\" initiative, including being the founding host and producer of \"Binary Revolution Radio\", a long-running weekly Internet radio show which ran 200 episodes from 2003 to 2007.\n\nBlake was born in Newport News, Virginia on September 13, 1971. He received an AAS (Associates in Applied Sciences) degree from the University of Kentucky 1992, and has a BS in Computer Science from Florida Atlantic University as well as a CEH certificate. He presently lives and works as a computer programmer/analyst in Orlando, Florida. Blake is a member of the International High IQ society.\n\nStankDawg is a staff writer for the well-known hacker periodical \"\", as well as the now-defunct \"Blacklisted! 411\" magazine. He has also been a contributing writer to several independent zines such as \"Outbreak\", \"Frequency\", and \"Radical Future\". He has been a frequent co-host of \"Default Radio\" and was a regular on \"Radio Freek America\", and has appeared on \"GAMERadio\", \"Infonomicon\", \"The MindWar\", \"Phreak Phactor\", and \"HPR (Hacker Public Radio)\".\n\nHe has presented at technology conferences such as DEF CON, H.O.P.E., and Interz0ne. He has been very outspoken about many topics, many of which have gotten some negative feedback from different sources. His most controversial article was entitled \"Hacking google Adwords\" at DefCon13 which drew criticism from such people as Jason Calacanis. among others. His presentation at the fifth H.O.P.E. conference drew some surprise from the AS/400 community.\n\nStankDawg appeared as a subject on the television show The Most Extreme on Animal Planet where he demonstrated the vulnerabilities of wireless internet connections.\n\nBlake chose the handle \"StankDawg\" in college, where he started a local hacking group which became known as the \"Digital DawgPound\".\n\nThe Digital DawgPound (more commonly referred to as the \"DDP\") is a group of hackers, best known for a series of articles in hacker magazines such as \"\" and \"Make\", the long-running webcast Binary Revolution Radio, and a very active set of forums with posts from high-profile hackers such as Strom Carlson, decoder, Phiber Optik and many more. The stated mission of the DDP is to propagate a more positive image of hackers than the negative mass media stereotype. The group welcomes new members who want to learn about hacking, and attempts to teach them more positive aspects and steer them away from the negative aspects by reinforcing the hacker ethic. Their goal is to show that hackers can, and regularly do, make positive contributions not only to technology, but to society as a whole.\n\nThe DDP was founded and named by StankDawg. His stated reasons were that he had made many friends in the hacking scene and thought that it would be useful to have everyone begin working together in a more organized fashion. He was motivated by the fact that there had been other well-known Hacker Groups in the 1980s who had accomplished great things in the hacking world such as the LoD and the MoD. In 1988, while a junior in high school, StankDawg came up with the name on his way to the \"Sweet 16\" computer programming competition. He jokingly referred to his teammates as \"The Digital Dawgpound\".\n\nStankDawg lurked in the shadows of the hacking world for many years throughout college under many different pseudonyms. In 1997 he popped his head out into the public and began becoming more active on IRC and many smaller hacking forums. He saw some people who he thought were insanely brilliant individuals who seemed to have the same mindset and positive attitude towards hacking that he did so he decided to approach a couple of them to see if anyone would be interested in forming a group and working together. There was always a huge emphasis not only on technical competence and variety, but also on strength of character and integrity. The team was a mix of hackers, programmers, phone phreakers, security professionals, and artists. They had experience in multiple programming languages and operating systems. DDP members are not only good programmers and hackers, but more importantly, good people. By 1999 the DDP had its first official members and from this partnership, creativity flowed.\n\nThe DDP communicated and worked together on StankDawg's personal site, which was open to anyone who wanted to join in on the fun. StankDawg was never comfortable with the fact that it was his name that was on the domain and that many people who were coming to the site were coming because of his articles or presentations but not really appreciating all of the other great contributions from other community members that were around. In 2002, after watching the web site grow quickly, it was decided that a new community needed to be created for these like-minded hackers who were gathering. This was the start of the biggest DDP project called Binary Revolution which was an attempt at starting a true \"community\" of hackers. As the site grew, so did the DDP roster.\n\nOver the years, DDP membership has included several staff writers for \"\" and \"Blacklisted! 411\" magazine including StankDawg and bland_inquisitor. They frequently publish articles, provide content, and appear on many media sources across the global Interweb. DDP members are also regular speakers at hacking conferences such as DEF CON, H.O.P.E., Interzone, Notacon, and many more smaller and more regional cons.\n\nSome DDP members hold memberships in Mensa and the International High IQ society. StankDawg is very proud of the diversity of the team and has spoken to this many times on Binary Revolution Radio. Members are from both coasts of the United States to Europe and have even had members from Jamaica, Brazil, and many other countries.\n\nThe DDP maintains a blog \"which they refer to as a \"blawg\" (Obviously a play on the intentionally misspelled word \"Dawg\"). Posts by DDP members have been featured on other technology-related sites such as those of Make Magazine,\nHackADay,\nHacked Gadgets, and others.\n\nIn 2003, StankDawg moved the forums from his personal site over to a new site as part of a project called the Binary Revolution which he considered a \"movement\" towards a more positive hacking community.\n\nThis \"Binary Revolution\" is the best known of the DDP projects and is commonly referred to simply as \"BinRev\". This project was created in an attempt to bring the hacking community back together, working towards a common, positive goal of reclaiming the name of hackers. The Binary Revolution emphasizes positive aspects of hacking and projects that help society. It does this in a variety of outlets including monthly meetings, the weekly radio show Binary Revolution Radio(BRR), a video-based series of shows called HackTV, and very active message board forums.\n\nBinRev is more than just a radio show or forums, although they are certainly the most well-known of the projects. It is actually composed of many parts.\n\nBinary Revolution Radio, often shortened to \"BRR\", was one part of the binrev community. Started and hosted by Blake in 2003, it featured different co-hosts each week, and covered different aspects of hacker culture and computer security.\n\nIt was broadcast via internet stream, usually prerecorded in Florida on a weekend, and then edited and released on the following Tuesday, on the DDP Hack Radio stream at 9:30pm EST. Topics included phreaking, identity theft, cryptography, operating systems, programming languages, free and open source software, wi-fi and bluetooth, social engineering, cyberculture, and information about various hacker conventions such as PhreakNIC, ShmooCon, H.O.P.E., and Def Con.\n\nIn July 2005 Blake announced that he was going to take a break, and so for the third season, the show was produced by Black Ratchet and Strom Carlson (who had been frequent co-hosts during Blake's run). During the time that they hosted the program, the format rotated between the standard prerecorded format, and a live format which included phone calls from listeners.\n\nBlake returned to the show in May 2006. He maintained the prerecorded format, and brought more community input into the show, by bringing on more members of the Binary Revolution community. For the first episode of the fourth season, BRR had its first ever broadcast in front of live audience during the HOPE 6 convention in New York City, June 2006.\n\nThe final episode, #200, took place on October 30, 2007, with a marathon episode which clocked in at 7 hours and 12 minutes.\n\n\nAs the forums grew there were many posts where people were looking for others in their area where other hacker meetings did not exist or were not approachable for some reason. Those places that did have meetings were sparse on information. Binary Revolution meetings were started as an answer to these problems and as a place for our forum members to get together. BinRev meetings offer free web hosting for all meetings to help organize the meetings and keep communications alive and to help projects to grow. Some meetings are in large cities like Chicago and Orlando while others are in small towns. Anyone can start their own BinRev meeting by asking in the BinRev forums.\n\n\"BRnet\" is the official IRC network of Binary Revolution. It is active at all hours of the day and contains a general #binrev channel but also contains many other channels for more specific and productive discussion.\n\nIn the middle of 2003, he released an Internet video show entitled \"HackTV\" which was the first internet television show about hacking, and which has grown into a series of several different shows. They were released irregularly since most of the episodes were filmed by StankDawg in South Florida where he lived at the time. They wanted the show to appear professional in terms of quality, but this made cooperating over the internet difficult. Sharing large video files was difficult and encoded video caused editing problems and quality concerns. The original show was released as full-length 30 minute episodes. This was also a problem since it because more and more difficult to get enough material for full-length episodes. There was also some content that was related to hacking only on a fringe level and StankDawg did not feel it was appropriate to include in the show. This led to other ideas.\n\nIn light of the difficulties of putting together the full HackTV original show, and in an attempt to make the show more accessible for community contributions, StankDawg launched a new series that was less focused on format and video quality that focused more on content and ease of participation. This series was titled \"HackTV:Underground\" or \"HTV:U\" for short. This series allowed anyone to contribute content in any format and at any length or video quality. The allowed people to film things with basic cameraphone quality video if this was the only way to get the content. One episode of HackTV:U was used by G4techTV show called \"Torrent\".\n\nThis series of HackTV was a prank style show, similar to the popular \"Punk'd\" show on MTV at the time. Even the logo is an obvious parody of the Punk'd logo. This series contains pranks that mostly took place at conferences, but is also open to social engineering and other light-hearted content.\n\nThe DocDroppers project is a community project to create a centralized place to store hacking articles and information while still maintaining some formatting and readability. Old ascii text files existed scattered across the internet but they come and go quickly and are difficult to find. They are usually formatted with the very basics and sometimes difficult to read. DocDroppers allows users to submit articles to a centralized place where they can be searchable, easily maintained, and easy to read and reference.\n\nRecently, this project has grown to include encyclopedia style entries on many hacking topics after many were deleted from sites such as Wikipedia. This has caused DocDroppers to include a section on hacker history and culture among its content.\n\n\n\nProjects that StankDawg was directly involved in creating/maintaining in addition to the ones mentioned above.\n\nOther links that were mentioned or referred to in this entry:\n"}

He is best known for his long essay on television and its effect on American culture, \"Within the Context of No Context,\" first published in \"The New Yorker\" on November 17, 1980, and later published as a book. This was one of the few times that the magazine devoted its central section to one piece of writing.\n\nTrow was born in an upper-middle-class family in Greenwich, Connecticut, the son of Anne \"(née\" Carter; 1918–2010) and George William Swift Trow (1916–1997). His father was a newspaperman. His great-great paternal grandfather, John Fowler Trow (1810–1886), was a New York-based publisher who is known today was the namesake of New York City directories. Trow studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, and graduated from Harvard University in 1965. There, he was president of \"The Harvard Lampoon\". He later served as an editor for its offshoot, the \"National Lampoon\", working with young humorists like Michael O'Donoghue, Henry Beard, and Douglas Kenney. He served on active duty in the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1966, Trow took a position at \"The New Yorker\", writing articles for the magazine, especially in the section \"The Talk of the Town,\" and contributing short fiction. He worked under editors William Shawn (1951–1987) and Robert Gottlieb (1987–1992), whom he saw as mentors.\n\nIn 1994, when new editor Tina Brown invited Roseanne Barr to oversee a special issue on women, Trow quit the magazine in protest. He abandoned the house he was building in Germantown, New York, and traveled around North America, living in Texas, Alaska, and Newfoundland. Several years before his death, he moved to Naples, Italy. In 2006 he died there, alone, having secluded himself for a decade.\n\nTrow was socially ambitious: throughout his life, he was \"striving to be part of the '10 percent of people at Harvard who wear tuxedos to their own little events in their own little buildings and you can see them out on their balconies with their tuxedos and their often very beautiful girls who are also similarly there from the Vanderbilts and the Astors.'\"\n\nThroughout his career, Trow analyzed mainstream American cultural institutions to understand how the culture had changed from the newspaper-reading, eastern Establishment-dominated world of his childhood in the 1940s and early 1950s, to the ahistorical, tabloid sensibility born in the Jazz Age and propagated by television.\n\nThe appeal and value of Trow's work can be difficult to communicate, because the style \"in its very essence resists summary. Summary, of course, flees from detail, whereas for Trow the details are the notes without which there is no song.\" Some critics have found Trow's works impenetrable and elitist; some argue that Trow's nostalgia for the pre-television era was misplaced, because the subsequent civil rights movements had made American culture more democratic.\n\n\"Within the Context of No Context\", which was edited by \"New Yorker\" editor William Shawn, was published in book form in 1981 accompanied by Trow's profile of music mogul Ahmet Ertegün. In 1997, \"No Context\" was reprinted with a new introductory essay, \"Collapsing Dominant\". In \"No Context\", Trow pointed out the role of television in the destruction of American public culture and Americans' sense of history. \"Middle-distance\" institutions that had long given Americans' lives real contexts (such as fraternal organizations, bowling leagues, and women's clubs), had disappeared as people stayed home to watch television. Their replacements, television shows, were false contexts designed to be just compelling enough to keep people watching. What remained as real contexts for Americans to live in were \"the grid of two hundred million\" (the U.S. population at the time) and \"the grid of intimacy\" (the immediate family). Celebrities had a real life in both grids, and only they could now be complete. Deprived of real context, everyone else now wanted to be celebrities themselves.\n\nTrow argued that as marketers segmented the viewers into demographically defined groups, and pitched advertisements and shows to particular niches, viewers for the first time learned to see themselves as part of an age-related demographic group rather than as part of a linear flow of people from the past into the future. In consequence, demography had replaced history as the default context for understanding the world. Things were now valued not on an absolute scale, but by discovering if one was in tune with one's group. Trow illustrates this point with a reference to \"Family Feud\", where a contestant was asked to guess \"what a poll of a hundred people had guessed would be the height of the average American woman. Guess what they guessed. Guess what they guessed the \"average\" is.\"\n\n\"No Context\" ends with a narrative memoir of Trow's experiences working two summers as a guide at the 1964 New York World's Fair. His summary of the Fair: \"At the Fair, one could see the world of television impersonating the world of history.”\n\nIn an obituary for Trow, the novelist and screenwriter Michael Tolkin is quoted as saying that \"No Context\" is no longer fashionable because \"It's not a polemic for change. It's just a cold description of where things are going. There aren't many books that are unafraid to be that negative.\"\n\nIn his essay \"The Harvard Black Rock Forest,\" Trow criticizes another mainstream American institution, Harvard University (which he had attended). The Black Rock Forest, 50 miles north of New York City along the Hudson River, had been donated to Harvard as a nature preserve for scientific studies. Trow writes about the Harvard administration's indifference to the property except as a profit opportunity, and its eventual rescue and dedication to educational nature studies.\n\nIn addition to his nonfiction, Trow also wrote casuals for \"The New Yorker\", many of which were \"subtle to the point of unintelligibility\", according to Ben Yagoda.\n\nA memoir, \"My Pilgrim's Progress: Media Studies, 1950–1998\", analyzes the cultural world of the United States in the 1950s, at the transitional time when television began to take over American culture. The book is written in a conversational style, sometimes transcribed from audiotapes. Trow \"swirls\" between pop and mainstream cultural icons, such as Doris Day, Alfred Hitchcock, Elvis Presley, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The book cover has a photograph of President Eisenhower, whom Trow admired as \"the guy of guys\". Trow asserts that the models of masculine adulthood presented to his generation by the official mass culture were so out of date or irrelevant that being in/on/with television (and adopting an ironic attitude to one's self) was the only possible choice. Some reviewers were put off by the book's haughtiness, elitism, or repeated statements of authority, e.g. \"You'll have to trust me on that one.\" According to a close friend, Trow was \"extremely upset\" by the critical reception of \"Progress\". After that, he only published one known article, a critique of television news anchor Dan Rather.\n\nTrow's only novel, \"The City in the Mist,\" (1984) did not impress critics. They were put off by its minimalist style and lack of plot, narrative momentum or involving characters. The book, which moves from the mid-19th century to the present, tracks the energy in three intertwined families, from the masculine vitality of a thuggish Irish immigrant to the weak flame of his elderly bachelor grandson, who lives on his income in two rooms in New York City, and spends his time caring for his clothes and going out into what remains of Society. The central concerns of the novel – the decline of masculine energy and the replacement of masculine social authority by feminine social authority – Trow later addresses explicitly in \"My Pilgrim's Progress.\"\n\n\n"}

The Arakan forest turtle is a semiterrestrial turtle, meaning it can survive in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats, but as adults, they prefer living in terrestrial habitats.\n\n\"Geoëmyda depressa\" was the scientific name proposed by Anderson in 1875 who described a zoological specimen collected in Arakan.\n\nThe Arakan forest turtle has 18 plastral annuli, a carapace length of and weighs .\n\nIn 2009, the Arakan forest turtles was discovered in Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range in Myanmar. The scientific team also labeled the area as a good prospective place to focus conservation efforts for the turtle, despite the fact that locals do occasionally hunt and eat them. Even with those activities, this protected area is difficult to access and lacks any human settlement, making any human interference with the turtle merely opportunistic. No large-scale commercial project hunts the turtle, nor would there be a demand for one, since the turtle is too difficult to find compared to the little profit there is for doing so. Furthermore, the area even has a low risk of being exploited for natural resources.\n\nThe Arakan forest turtle is active at night and increases its activity during the early wet season. Local hunters found eggs in June and July when skinning female specimens, possibly revealing the reproductive system and cycle of the species.\nIt remains dormant the majority of the time and hides in leaves and debris. It is an omnivore, feeding on both animals and plants. Although it is considered a relatively reserved animal for the majority of its daily activity, it is aggressive when it comes to eating insects, worms, and fish. It also consumes fruit that falls to the forest floor.\n\nArakan forest turtles are being traded by animal pet dealers in China, who catch them in western Myanmar. In 2003, researchers took samples for research from nine Arakan forest turtles that had been imported to the Czech Republic to be kept in a private collection.\n\n"}

In 1975, Gerulaitis won the men's doubles title at Wimbledon, partnering with Sandy Mayer. He won the men's singles title at one of the two Australian Open tournaments held in 1977 (Gerulaitis won the tournament that was held in December, while Roscoe Tanner won the earlier January tournament). Gerulaitis also won two Italian Open titles, in 1977 and 1979, and the WCT Finals in Dallas, in 1978.\n\nGerulaitis was born on July 26, 1954, in Brooklyn, New York, to Lithuanian immigrant parents, and grew up in Howard Beach, Queens. He attended Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens, graduating in 1971. He attended Columbia College of Columbia University for one year before dropping out to pursue tennis full-time. Gerulaitis was nicknamed \"The Lithuanian Lion\". His younger sister Ruta was also a professional tennis player.\n\nGerulaitis led the Pittsburgh Triangles to the World TeamTennis championship title at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena in 1975. Gerulaitis played for the Triangles from 1974 until 1976. He also played for the league's Indiana Loves franchise in 1977.\n\nGerulaitis was coached by Fred Stolle from 1977 until 1983.\n\nHe also won the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 1975. He was a singles semifinalist at Wimbledon in both 1977 and 1978. In 1977 he lost a Wimbledon semifinal to his close friend and practice partner, Björn Borg, 6–4, 3–6, 6–3, 3–6, 8–6, a match later considered one of the greatest of the decade.\n\nIn 1977, Gerulaitis won the most significant title of his career at the Australian Open, when he defeated John Lloyd in the men's singles final in five sets.\n\nIn 1978, Gerulaitis won the year-end championship WCT Finals for the World Championship Tennis tour, beating Eddie Dibbs 6–3, 6–2, 6–1. By 1978, he was the third-ranked men's singles player in the world.\n\nIn 1979, Gerulaitis lost in the men's singles finals at the US Open to fellow New Yorker, John McEnroe, in straight sets. He was a member of the United States team which won the Davis Cup in 1979. He won two singles \"rubbers\" in the final, as the US beat Italy 5–0.\n\nGerulaitis reached his third Grand Slam singles final in 1980, when he lost in the final of the French Open to Björn Borg in straight sets.\n\nIn February 1981, Gerulaitis won the star-laden Toronto Indoor invitational tournament, defeating John McEnroe in the final after having defeated Jimmy Connors in the semifinal.\n\nDuring his career, Gerulaitis won 25 top-level singles titles and eight doubles titles. His career-high singles ranking was world No. 3 which he reached on February 27, 1978.\n\nGerulaitis was known for his exceptionally quick hands at the net and his outstanding court coverage.\nIn 1985, Gerulaitis teamed with Bobby Riggs to launch a challenge to female players after the famous \"Battle of the Sexes\". The stunt, however, was short-lived when Gerulaitis and Riggs lost a doubles match against Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver.\n\nHe retired from the professional tour in 1986, and was a regular tennis commentator on the USA network between 1988 and 1994.\n\nGerulaitis coached Pete Sampras during the 1994 Italian Open in Rome, when Sampras' coach, Tim Gullikson, was on a family vacation. Sampras won the title by defeating Boris Becker in the final in straight sets.\n\nGerulaitis is the subject of a Half Man Half Biscuit song from the \"McIntyre, Treadmore and Davitt\" album, \"Outbreak of Vitas Gerulaitis\".\n\nGerulaitis died on September 17, 1994, at the age of 40. While he was visiting a friend's home in Southampton, New York, an improperly installed pool heater caused carbon monoxide gas to seep into the guesthouse where Gerulaitis was sleeping, causing his death by carbon monoxide poisoning. Gerulaitis failed to show up for a dinner at 7 p.m. that evening and his body was found the following day by a maid who went to the guesthouse. Gerulaitis' remains were interred in Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.\n\nCriminal charges of negligent homicide were later brought against the pool mechanic and the company he worked for. Both he and the company were acquitted at a trial approximately two years later in October 1996. Jurors heard testimony that a technician from the heater manufacturer had made adjustments several days before Gerulaitis' death and that even if an exhaust pipe had been longer, carbon monoxide (colorless and odorless) would have still been drawn into the air-conditioning vent because it is heavier than air. Arthur M. Luxenberg, a lawyer for the Gerulaitis family, stated that Gerulaitis' mother and sister believed the verdict to be fair, and he went on to state that the testimony at the trial \"confirmed to us what we always knew: that there were a lot of other people involved in this matter.\"\n\nThe Vitas Gerulaitis Memorial Tennis Centre was opened in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Also, a street in Vilnius is named after him.\n\n\"And let that be a lesson to you all. Nobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row.\"\n\n\n"}

His father, Gaspar G. Bacon, was on the board of Harvard University, and later, in the 1930s, served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts.\n\nBorn to a life of privilege and wealth, David Bacon attended Deerfield Academy and graduated from Harvard in 1937. He summered with his family at Woods Hole on Cape Cod, where he became involved during the early 1930s with the \"University Players,\" at West Falmouth. There he met then unknown performers James Stewart and Henry Fonda, with whom he later shared accommodations while he struggled to establish himself.\n\nBacon's acting career failed to progress, and he drifted for several years. He moved to New York City, where he was sponsored by a wealthy British patron, and although he once again failed to secure employment, he began to wear expensive clothes and jewelry, leading to speculation that he was acting as a gigolo.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles, where he met and married Austrian singer and actress Greta Keller, eleven years his senior, in 1942. In her later years, Keller disclosed that Bacon was homosexual, and that she was lesbian, and that their lavender marriage partly served as what she referred to as a \"beard\", allowing both of them to maintain the requisite facade in Hollywood, where they were both attempting to establish film careers.\n\nIn 1942, Howard Hughes met Bacon, and signed him to an exclusive contract, with the intention of casting him in \"The Outlaw\" (1943) as Billy the Kid. Bacon screen tested for the role and was found unsuitable. Though Hughes later decided not to use Bacon in \"The Outlaw\", replacing him with actor Jack Beutel, he kept Bacon to the terms of his contract, casting him in several smaller roles, usually as college boys. Keller alleged that there was a homosexual relationship between Hughes and Bacon, and she blamed the alleged relationship for Bacon's being replaced. Hughes, however, was widely known as a womanizer and was often the target of unscrupulous claims to cash in on his money. Later, Hughes did lend Bacon for a role in the Republic serial \"The Masked Marvel\" (1943). The serial was produced with a low budget, and marked a low point in Bacon's career, with Keller recalling that he was completely humiliated. Today it remains his best remembered work.\n\nOn September 12, 1943, Bacon was seen driving a car erratically in Santa Monica, California, before running off the road and into the curb. Several witnesses saw him climb out of the car and stagger briefly before collapsing. As they approached he asked them to help him, but he died before he could say anything more. A small puncture wound was found in his back; the weapon had punctured his lung and caused his death. A weapon was never found, though the wound was suggested to be from a stiletto. Keller, who was then five months pregnant, collapsed when she heard of her husband's death.\nShe was inconsolable and was given sedatives by Bacon's brother, a doctor. On September 20, eight days after Bacon's death, Keller went into labor and delivered a stillborn.\n\nWhen he died, Bacon was wearing only a swimsuit, and a wallet and camera were found in his car. Also in his car was a small sweater not belonging to Bacon. Allegedly, the film from the camera was developed and found to contain only one image, that of Bacon, nude and smiling on a beach. There is no proof of the existence of this photo, however, and it is believed to be a rumor long built into the story as fact. The case attracted publicity for a time and remains unsolved.\n\nDavid Bacon was cremated at Cunningham & O'Connor Mortuary in Santa Monica. His cremains were shipped to Massachusetts where they were interred at Woods Hole Village Cemetery (also known as Church of the Messiah Memorial Garden) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n"}

The islands were collectively named after the largest island in the group, Ponza. The other islands in the archipelago are Palmarola, Zannone,\nand Gavi to the northwest, Ventotene and Santo Stefano to the southeast. These two groups are separated by . From Sabaudia-Cape Circeo peninsula to Zannone the distance is , while Ventotene faces Gaeta (21 miles). The minimum distance between Santo Stefano and the isle of Ischia is .\n\nThe archipelago is volcanic and has been inhabited for thousands of years. Neolithic artifacts and Bronze Age obsidians have been excavated on the islands. The islands were used by the Etruscans who carved the \"Blue Grottos\". The earliest recorded history of the islands occurs with the Roman victory over the Volsci at 338 BC. According to a local legend, this was once the lost Kingdom of Tyrrhenia which sank with a narrow strip connected to mainland Italy.\n\nDuring the reign of Rome's Caesar Augustus, residential expansion on the islands was encouraged and people spread from Ponza to Ventotene. Rome used the two islands as a retreat and a place to exile politically troubling citizens. Some two thousands years later the islands were used for the same reason by the Fascist regime. Agrippina the Younger, mother to the future Roman emperor, Nero, was exiled to the Pontine Islands by her brother, the then Roman emperor, Caligula, in 39 AD, before having the exile lifted by her uncle, the emperor Claudius upon his succession. Deposed Pope Silverius was exiled here in 537 where he would die soon afterwards.\n\nThe Pontine were abandoned during the Middle Ages due to constant raids by Saracens and pirates. During the 18th century, the Kingdom of Naples re-colonized the islands, and they later became part of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nPonza and Ventotene are populated, while the smaller islands are not. Ventotene and Santo Stefano are land and sea conservation areas supervised by the Italian State.\n\nCurrently, tiny vineyards, wild herbs and flowers, and secluded beaches and grottos make them a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1834720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834720", "title": "XDR DRAM", "text": "XDR DRAM\n\nXDR DRAM (extreme data rate dynamic random-access memory) is a high-performance dynamic random-access memory interface. It is based on and successor to RDRAM. Competing technologies include DDR2 and GDDR4.\n\nXDR was designed to be effective in small, high-bandwidth consumer systems, high-performance memory applications, and high-end GPUs. It eliminates the unusually high latency problems that plagued early forms of RDRAM. Also, XDR DRAM has heavy emphasis on per-pin bandwidth, which can benefit further cost control on PCB production. This is because fewer lanes are needed for the same amount of bandwidth. Rambus owns the rights to the technology. XDR is used by Sony in the PlayStation 3 console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn XDR RAM chip's high-speed signals are a differential clock input (clock from master, CFM/CFMN), a 12-bit single-ended request/command bus (RQ11..0), and a bidirectional differential data bus up to 16 bits wide (DQ15..0/DQN15..0). The request bus may be connected to several memory chips in parallel, but the data bus is point to point; only one RAM chip may be connected to it. To support different amounts of memory with a fixed-width memory controller, the chips have a programmable interface width. A 32-bit-wide DRAM controller may support 2 16-bit chips, or be connected to 4 memory chips each of which supplies 8 bits of data, or up to 16 chips configured with 2-bit interfaces.\n\nIn addition, each chip has a low-speed serial bus used to determine its capabilities and configure its interface. This consists of three shared inputs: a reset line (RST), a serial command input (CMD) and a serial clock (SCK), and serial data in/out lines (SDI and SDO) that are daisy-chained together and eventually connect to a single pin on the memory controller.\n\nAll single-ended lines are active-low; an asserted signal or logical 1 is represented by a low voltage.\n\nThe request bus operates at double data rate relative to the clock input. Two consecutive 12-bit transfers (beginning with the falling edge of CFM) make a 24-bit command packet.\n\nThe data bus operates at 8x the speed of the clock; a 400 MHz clock generates 3200 MT/s. All data reads and writes operate in 16-transfer bursts lasting 2 clock cycles.\n\nRequest packet formats are as follows:\n\nThere are a large number of timing constraints giving minimum times that must elapse between various commands (see ); the DRAM controller sending them must ensure they are all met.\n\nSome commands contain delay fields; these delay the effect of that command by the given number of clock cycles. This permits multiple commands (to different banks) to take effect on the same clock cycle.\n\nThis operates equivalently to standard SDRAM's activate command, specifying a row address to be loaded into the bank's sense amplifier array. To save power, a chip may be configured to only activate a portion of the sense amplifier array. In this case, the SR1..0 bits specify the half or quarter of the row to activate, and following read/write commands' column addresses are required to be limited to that portion. (Refresh operations always use the full row.)\n\nThese operate analogously to a standard SDRAM's read or write commands, specifying a column address. Data is provided to the chip a few cycles after a write command (typically 3), and is output by the chip several cycles after a read command (typically 6). Just as with other forms of SDRAM, the DRAM controller is responsible for ensuring that the data bus is not scheduled for use in both directions at the same time. Data is always transferred in 16-transfer bursts, lasting 2 clock cycles. Thus, for a ×16 device, 256 bits (32 bytes) are transferred per burst.\n\nIf the chip is using a data bus less than 16 bits wide, one or more of the sub-column address bits are used to select the portion of the column to be presented on the data bus. If the data bus is 8 bits wide, SC3 is used to identify which half of the read data to access; if the data bus is 4 bits wide, SC3 and SC2 are used, etc.\n\nUnlike conventional SDRAM, there is no provision for choosing the order in which the data is supplied within a burst. Thus, it is not possible to perform critical-word-first reads.\n\nThe masked write command is similar to a normal write, but no command delay is permitted and a mask byte is supplied. This permits controlling which 8-bit fields are written. This is \"not\" a bitmap indicating which bytes are to be written; it would not be large enough for the 32 bytes in a write burst. Rather, it is a bit pattern which the DRAM controller fills unwritten bytes with. The DRAM controller is responsible for finding a pattern which does not appear in the other bytes that are to be written. Because there are 256 possible patterns and only 32 bytes in the burst, it is straightforward to find one. Even when multiple devices are connected in parallel, a mask byte can always be found when the bus is at most 128 bits wide. (This would produce 256 bytes per burst, but a masked write command is only used if at least one of them is not to be written.)\n\nEach byte is the 8 consecutive bits transferred across one data line during a particular clock cycle. M0 is matched to the first data bit transferred during a clock cycle, and M7 is matched to the last bit.\n\nThis convention also interferes with performing critical-word-first reads; any word must include bits from at least the first 8 bits transferred.\n\nThis command is similar to a combination of a conventional SDRAM's precharge and refresh commands. The POP\"x\" and BP\"x\" bits specify a precharge operation, while the ROP\"x\", DELR\"x\", and BR\"x\" bits specify a refresh operation. Each may be separately enabled. If enabled, each may have a different command delay and must be addressed to a different bank.\n\nPrecharge commands may only be sent to one bank at a time; unlike a conventional SDRAM, there is no \"precharge all banks\" command.\n\nRefresh commands are also different from a conventional SDRAM. There is no \"refresh all banks\" command, and the refresh operation is divided into separate activate and precharge operations so the timing is determined by the memory controller. The refresh counter is also programmable by the controller. Operations are:\n\nThis command performs a number of miscellaneous functions, as determined by the XOP\"x\" field. Although there are 16 possibilities, only 4 are actually used. Three subcommands start and stop output driver calibration (which must be performed periodically, every 100 ms).\n\nThe fourth subcommand places the chip in power-down mode. In this mode, it performs internal refresh and ignores the high-speed data lines. It must be woken up using the low-speed serial bus.\n\nXDR DRAMs are probed and configured using a low-speed serial bus. The RST, SCK, and CMD signals are driven by the controller to every chip in parallel. The SDI and SDO lines are daisy-chained together, with the last SDO output connected to the controller, and the first SDI input tied high (logic 0).\n\nOn reset, each chip drives its SDO pin low (1). When reset is released, a series of SCK pulses are sent to the chips. Each chip drives its SDO output high (0) one cycle after seeing its SDI input high (0). Further, it counts the number of cycles that elapse between releasing reset and seeing its SDI input high, and copies that count to an internal chip ID register. Commands sent by the controller over the CMD line include an address which must match the chip ID field.\n\nEach command either reads or writes a single 8-bit register, using an 8-bit address. This allows up to 256 registers, but only the range 1–31 is currently assigned.\n\nNormally, the CMD line is left high (logic 0) and SCK pulses have no effect. To send a command, a sequence of 32 bits is clocked out over the CMD lines:\n\n\n\n"}

He began his career as a member of Broadway's pit orchestras, and later went on to produce solo albums for songs that were picked up by leading music performers including The Carpenters, Barry Manilow, and Dionne Warwick. He is known for his work in comedy films. He has been awarded many prestigious awards, including two nominations for a Golden Globe Award, a BAFTA Award, and twelve BMI Awards. Edelman was given an honorary doctorate in fine arts by the University of Cincinnati in 2004.\n\nSome of Edelman's best known films scores include \"Twins\", \"Kindergarten Cop\", \"Beethoven\", \"Gettysburg\", \"The Mask\", \"Dragonheart\", \"Daylight\" and \"XXX\". He also wrote the theme of the popular television series \"MacGyver\". Many of his musical pieces have been reused in television advertising, trailers, Disney movies, and award shows.\n\nEdelman was born in Paterson, New Jersey, to a Jewish family. He was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, the son of a first-grade teacher and an accountant, and graduated from Teaneck High School in 1965. He attended the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music before heading to New York where he played piano in Broadway pit orchestras. He produced several solo albums of songs (some of which were later recorded by The Carpenters (\"I Can't Make Music\", \"Piano Picker\" and \"You\"), Barry Manilow (\"Weekend in New England\"), \"If Love Is Real\" from Olivia Newton-John's \"Making a Good Thing Better\", Dionne Warwick (\"The Laughter and the Tears,\" \"Blood Sweat and Tears,\" \"Blue Street\") and many others before moving to Los Angeles. It was there where Edelman started to work in television and film scoring, while producing his solo albums which found a cult following in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan.\n\nOne of his first film scores was for the 1973 film \"Executive Action\", which put forward a conspiracy theory concerning the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1963. In the mid-1980s, Edelman wrote the theme to, and scored many episodes of, \"MacGyver\", a popular television series starring Richard Dean Anderson.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, he also collaborated with Ivan Reitman, producing scores for several of his comedies, including \"Ghostbusters II\", \"Twins\" and \"Kindergarten Cop\". He also contributed to \"Beethoven\"; \"The Last of the Mohicans\"; \"The Mask\"; \"Daylight\"; \"Anaconda\"; \"XXX\"; \"Gettysburg\"; \"My Cousin Vinny\"; \"While You Were Sleeping\"; \"Dragonheart\"; \"Shanghai Noon\"; \"Six Days, Seven Nights\"; \"The Indian in the Cupboard\"; \"Billy Madison\"; \"Angels in the Outfield\"; and \"EDtv\" to name just a few.\n\nEdelman was honored with the Richard Kirk Award at the 2003 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music. In 2004, he received an honorary doctorate in fine arts from the University of Cincinnati. He was given the degree along with three other honorees distinguished in various other fields, including Coretta Scott King.\n\nHe produced the scores for the 2008 film \"\". This score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, where in 2010 Edelman also recorded and composed the Irish flavored music score for Amy Adams's film \"Leap Year\". He was awarded the Goldspirit Award (named in honor of Jerry Goldsmith) for best comedy score of 2011 for the \"Leap Year\" soundtrack CD on Varèse Sarabande.\n\nWhile some of the films scored by Edelman were not commercial successes, the music was often reused elsewhere. Themes he wrote for \"Kindergarten Cop\" (particularly \"Rain Ride\"), \"Dragonheart\", \"\" (particularly the film's love theme \"Bruce and Linda\"), \"Gettysburg\" and other films have been widely used in television advertising, film trailers, Disney movies including \"Mulan\", and during the Academy Awards. Themes from his score for \"Come See the Paradise\" have been used in film trailers more than cues from any other film soundtrack.\n\nHis music from \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\" is featured during NBC's Olympic Games coverage when announcing upcoming events. In addition, it was used during NBC's coverage of the 1997 World Series. At the end of the 1996 Summer Olympics, it used the closing music of \"Gettysburg\". In the 1990s, Edelman composed the popular theme music for NBC's NFL telecasts which was used for the 1995–97 seasons through Super Bowl XXXII.\n\nEdelman has been married to singer Jackie DeShannon since June 3, 1976.

Before the total destruction of Saint-Pierre in 1902 by a volcanic eruption, it was the most important city of Martinique culturally and economically, being known as \"the Paris of the Caribbean\". While Fort-de-France was the official administrative capital, Saint-Pierre was the cultural capital of Martinique. After the disaster, Fort-de-France grew in economic importance.\n\nSaint-Pierre was founded in 1635 by Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc, a French trader and adventurer, as the first permanent French colony on the island of Martinique.\n\nThe Great Hurricane of 1780 produced a storm-surge of which \"inundated the city, destroying all houses\" and killed 9,000 people.\n\nThe town was again destroyed in 1902, when the volcano Mount Pelée erupted, killing 28,000 people. The entire population of the town, as well as people from neighboring villages who had taken refuge in the supposedly safe city, died, except for two people—a prisoner by the name of Louis-Auguste Cyparis (known also by various other names), who later toured the world with the Barnum and Bailey Circus, and Léon Compère-Léandre, who lived at the edge of the city.\n\nLegend has it that the town's doom was forecast by loud groaning noises from within the volcano, but the mayor of the town had it blocked off to prevent people from leaving during an election. This story appears to have originated with one of the island's newspapers, published by a political opponent of the governor. Actually, there was considerable eruptive activity in the two weeks prior to the fatal blast, but since the phenomenon of the pyroclastic flow () was not yet understood, the danger was perceived to be from lava flows, which, it was believed, would be stopped by two valleys between the volcano and the city.\n\nThe city of Saint-Pierre was never restored to its former entirety, though some villages were built in later decades on its place.\n\nToday, the town is the district capital of the Caribbean North district of Martinique. It has been designated as a \"City of Art and History\". There are many historic remains, and a Volcanological Museum ().\n\n\n"}

The award was established in 1957 by Gerald Loeb, a founding partner of E.F. Hutton & Co. Loeb's intention in creating the award was to encourage reporters to inform and protect private investors as well as the general public in the areas of business, finance and the economy.\n\nLoeb first became known for his book \"The Battle for Investment Survival\", which was popular during the Great Depression and is still considered a classic. Born in 1899, Loeb began his investing career in 1921 in the bond department of a brokerage firm in San Francisco, California. He moved to New York in 1921 after joining with E. F. Hutton & Co., and became vice-chairman of the board when the company incorporated in 1962. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 greatly affected Loeb's investing style, and in his 1971 book \"The Battle for Stock Market Profits\", he viewed the market as a battlefield. Loeb offered a contrarian investing viewpoint, in books and columns in \"Barron's\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Investor Magazine\". \"Forbes\" magazine called Loeb \"the most quoted man on Wall Street.\" He created the Gerald Loeb Award in order to foster further quality reporting for individual investors.\n\nThe award has been administered by the UCLA Anderson School of Management since 1973, and is sponsored by the G. and R. Loeb Foundation. It is regarded as: \"business journalism's highest honor,\" and its \"most prestigious.\" Beginning with just two winners in 1958 (Werner Renberg and David Steinberg) and expanding to three in the final years before the Anderson School began to administer the award, today there are ten categories in which prizes are awarded: large newspaper, medium newspaper, small newspaper, magazine, commentary, deadline or beat writing, wire services, and television.

Lord Vishnu's Temple Vishnupad Mandir is situated on the bank of Phalgu river.\n\nThe Phalgu is formed by the confluence, some below Bodh Gaya, of the Lilajan (also called Niranjan or Nilanjan) and the Mohana, two large hill streams each of which is over wide. The Phalgu is also mentioned as Niranjan. The united stream flows on to the north past the town of Gaya, where it attains a breadth of over . The Phalgu here passes by a high rocky bank, on the steep sides of which are many paved stairs leading down to the river bed, while high above are the Vishnupad Mandir, with many minor shrines around it. It then runs in a north-easterly direction for about , and opposite the Barabar hills it again takes the name of Mohana, and divides into two branches which eventually flow into a branch of the Punpun.\n\nThe Phalgu like its confluent streams, Lilajan and Mohana, is subject to high floods during the monsoons but in other seasons of the year it dwindles to a stream wandering through a wide expanse of sand.\n\nThe portion of the course of the Phalgu flowing by Gaya is sacred to the Hindus. It is the first holy site visited by the pilgrim and here his first offering must be made for the souls of his ancestors. According to the Gaya Mahatmya, which forms part of the \"Vayu Purana\", the Phalgu is the embodiment of Vishnu himself. One tradition states that it formerly flowed with milk.\n\nAccording to Hindu belief, the soul wanders after death until \"pindadan\", or religious service seeking salvation for the dead from the cycle of rebirth, is performed. The fortnight-long \"pitrapaksh\" period is considered auspicious to offer \"pindadan\". The 15 days of the waning moon during the Hindu month of Ashvin are known as \"pitrapaksh\". \"Pindadan\" is traditionally offered on the banks of the Phalgu at Gaya. It is mandatory for Hindu devotees offering \"pindadan\" to shave their heads and take a holy dip and head for the Baitarni pond. The prayers are performed at the Vishnupad Mandir. Priests, known as Gaywal-pandas, conduct the ritual. Thousands of Hindus visit Gaya for the purpose of \"pindadan\".\n\nThere is reference to the city of Gaya and the Phalgu in the Ramayana in which it says that Sita had cursed the Phalgu River. There is an interesting story and the \"purana\" states that on account of this curse, the Phalgu lost its water, and the river is simply a vast stretch of sand dunes. According to history, in the absence of Rama, his wife Sita offered \"pinda\" on its banks to Dasharatha father of Rama.\n\nThe story goes that Rama, along with his brothers and Sita, came to Gaya to perform the sacred rites for his father, Dasaratha. When the brothers were bathing in the river, Sita was sitting on the banks, playing with the sand. Suddenly, Dasaratha appeared out of the sand, and asked for the Pindam, saying he was hungry. Sita asked him to wait till his sons returned, so that she could give him the traditional Pindam of rice and til. He refused to wait, asking her to give him pindams made of the sand in her hand.\n\nHaving no other option, she gave him the Pindam he desired with five witnesses – the Akshaya Vatam, the Falguni River, a cow, a Tulsi plant and a Brahmin. Soon, Rama returned and started the rituals. In those days apparently, the ancestors would arrive in person to collect their share, and when Dasaratha did not appear, they wondered why. Sita then told them what had happened, but Rama could not believe that his father would accept pindams made of sand. Sita now mentioned her witnesses, and asked them to tell Rama the truth.\n\nAmong the five, only the Akshaya Vatam took her side and told the truth, while the others lied, trying to take Rama’s side. In her anger, Sita cursed all of them thus: the Falguni river henceforth would have no water at Gaya; the Cow would no longer be worshipped from the front as all others are- only its backside would be worshipped; there would be no more Tulsi plants at Gaya and the Gaya Brahmins would never be satisfied, they would always be hungry and crave more and more. She then blessed the Akshaya Vatam saying that all who came to Gaya would perform the Pinda pradaanam at the Akshaya Vatam too.\n\nBefore attaining Enlightenment, the prince Siddhārtha Gautama practiced asceticism for six years (ten or twelve years according to some accounts) on the banks of the river, residing in a forest near the village of Uruvilvā. After realizing that strict asceticism would not lead to Enlightenment, he recuperated after bathing in the river and receiving a bowl of milk-rice from the milkmaid Sujātā.\n\nHe sat under the nearby pippala tree, where he finally achieved Enlightenment. This tree became known as the Bodhi Tree, and the site became known as Bodh Gayā.\n"}

It was founded in 1992 after the merger of Croatian Democratic Party (HDS) and the Croatian Christian Democratic Party (HKDS).\n\nThe Croatian Christian Democratic Party (\"Hrvatska kršćanska demokratska stranka, HKDS\") was created in 1989 and modelled after the Christian-democratic parties of Western Europe, although, due to specific circumstances of early 1990s Croatia, it had more right wing than centre-right rhetoric.\n\nIn the 1990 Croatian parliamentary election, it joined a bloc of moderate nationalists called the Coalition of People's Accord. Like all parties of that bloc, it fared badly, but one year later it held a ministerial post in the \"National Unity\" government of Franjo Gregurić.\nIn the 1992 Croatian parliamentary election, HKDS, running on its own ticket, failed to enter Croatian Parliament, while its leader Ivan Cesar finished seventh in presidential race. This fiasco led HKDS to unite with Croatian Democratic Party (HDS). A dissident faction of the HKDS continued to operate under the party's old name.\n\nThe Croatian Democratic Party (\"Hrvatska demokratska stranka, HDS\") was a right-wing party that was among the first to be founded after the arrival of multi-party democracy in Croatia. Led by veteran Communist-era dissident Marko Veselica, HDS was supposed to be the focal point for the most radical Croatian nationalists. This spot was, however, taken by Franjo Tuđman and his Croatian Democratic Union. HDS instead joined moderate Coalition of People's Accord and, consequently, fared badly in the 1990 Croatian parliamentary election.\n\nAfter the 1990 election, HDS tried to live to its radical reputation by harshly criticising Tuđman's government for the perceived appeasement of Serbia and Yugoslav People's Army during the opening stages of the Croatian war. When the war escalated in the summer of 1991, HDS was nevertheless admitted into the \"National Unity\" government of Franjo Gregurić.\n\nIn less than a year, HDS lost its reputation as the most radical Croatian party to the Croatian Party of Rights. This was reflected on the 1992 presidential and parliamentary elections, which led HDS to merge with the Croatian Christian Democratic Party (HKDS).\n\nThe Croatian Christian Democratic Union was represented in Croatian Parliament between 1995 and 2003:\n\nLong-time presidents of the party were Marko Veselica (1992-2001) and Anto Kovačević (2001-2007).\n\nIn 2007, the party held a new \"founding assembly\" (osnivački sabor) and elected Željko Nuić as its new president, who criticized the former presidents Petar Ćurlin, Marko Veselica and Anto Kovačević as failures of the party.\n"}

In 1979 he wrote what is often identified as the first North American work on philosophy of technology, \"Technics and Praxis\". \n\nBefore his retirement, Ihde was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. In 2013 Ihde received the Golden Eurydice Award. \n\nIhde is the author of over twenty original books and the editor of many others. Ihde lectures and gives seminars internationally and some of his books and articles have appeared in a dozen languages.\n\nIhde's work \"Bodies in Technology\" spells out the original exploration of the ways cyberspace affects the human experience. The book explores embodiment in cyberspace with references to human–computer interaction (HCI) research. The main question of the book is the meaning of bodies in technology.\n\nIhde rejects Cartesian dualism. Even to have an out of body experience is to have an implicit 'here-body' from which we experience an 'object-body' over there. He has further explored these arguments in his book \"Bodies in Technology\".\n\nBeginning with a \"phenomenology of multistability\" in the way various \"technological media\" are perceived, Ihde examines the \"roles of human embodiment, perception, and spatial transformations within communication and information media.\"\n\nIhde argues that movies like the Matrix trilogy play upon fantasy in a technological context and relate to the human sense of embodiment. He stresses an important fact that we have to experience the embodiment where we live, rather than to \"plugin\" to a technofantasies world.\n\nThe study of technoscience examines cutting-edge work in the fields of the philosophies of science and technology, and science studies; it also emphasizes the roles of our material cultures and expertise. According to Ihde, science and technology are in a symbiotic relationship, where scientific research relies fully on the development of scientific instruments, the technological development.\n\nIn a paper \"Was Heidegger prescient concerning Technoscience?\", Ihde re-examines Martin Heidegger's philosophy of science with a reappraisal of what was innovative, and what remained archaic. Heidegger then is read against the background of the \"new\" approaches to science in science studies, and against the background of the scientific revolutions which have occurred since the mid-20th century.\n\nIhde has introduced the concept of material hermeneutics, which characterises much practice within the domains of technoscience. He rejects the vestigial Diltheyan division between the humanistic and natural sciences and argues that certain types of critical interpretation, broadly hermeneutic, characterize both sets of disciplines. He examines what he calls a style of interpretation based in material practices relating to imaging technologies which have given rise to the visual hermeneutics in technoscience studies.\n\nWith references to science studies, sociology of science and feminist critique of science, Ihde have present the idea of expanding hermeneutics, that emphasises praxis, instruments and laboratories over theoretical work. He claims that in science, the instruments and technologies used operate in hermeneutic way.\n\nIhde has argued on numerous occasions that \"if the philosopher is to play a more important role it must not be only in or limited to the Hemingway role. Rather, it should take place in the equivalent of the officers' strategy meeting, before the battle takes shape. I will call this the 'R&D role'\". Philosophers should engage themselves on interdisciplinary research teams and actively participate in research and development work.

It has 99 cells around a central watchtower. Built for 600 inmates, it had 800 in 1817 (and 400 on Ventotene). People imprisoned included Carmine Crocco, the most important brigand during the Italian unification, and the anarchist Gaetano Bresci, who killed King Umberto I in 1900. He was imprisoned there for a year before being found hanged in his cell. During the Fascist regime, other prisoners were the future President of Italy Sandro Pertini, Umberto Terracini, Giorgio Amendola, Lelio Basso, Mauro Scoccimarro, Giuseppe Romita, Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi.\n\nIn October 1860, part of the Bourbon troops left the island for the siege of Gaeta.\nDuring a revolt, some Camorra prisoners proclaimed the Republic of Santo Stefano.\nThe prisoners legislated a statute and remained autonomous until January 1861, when a Navy contingent recovered the island.\n\nThe island has been uninhabited since the closure of the prison, except for tourists that visit by boat during the day.\n\nThe island has had several names, such as Partenope, Palmosa, Dommo Stephane and Borca since Roman times.\n\nThe island was put up for sale in 2012 for the price of €20,000,000. This did not include the prison.\n\nThis island once harbored an endemic lizard, the Santo Stefano Lizard (\"Podarcis sicula sanctistephani\").

{"id": "1834808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834808", "title": "Hardenability", "text": "Hardenability\n\nThe hardenability of a metal alloy is the depth to which a material is hardened after putting it through a heat treatment process. It should not be confused with hardness, which is a measure of a sample's resistance to indentation or scratching. It is an important property for welding, since it is inversely proportional to weldability, that is, the ease of welding a material.\n\nWhen a hot steel work-piece is quenched, the area in contact with the water immediately cools and its temperature equilibrates with the quenching medium. The inner depths of the material however, do not cool so rapidly, and in work-pieces that are large, the cooling rate may be slow enough to allow the austenite to transform fully into a structure other than martensite or bainite. This results in a work-piece that does not have the same crystal structure throughout its entire depth; with a softer core and harder \"shell\". The softer core is some combination of ferrite and cementite, such as pearlite.\n\nThe hardenability of ferrous alloys, i.e. steels, is a function of the carbon content and other alloying elements and the grain size of the austenite. The relative importance of the various alloying elements is calculated by finding the equivalent carbon content of the material.\n\nThe fluid used for quenching the material influences the cooling rate due to varying thermal conductivities and specific heats. Substances like brine and water cool the steel much more quickly than oil or air. If the fluid is agitated cooling occurs even more quickly. The geometry of the part also affects the cooling rate: of two samples of equal volume, the one with higher surface area will cool faster.\n\nThe hardenability of a ferrous alloy is measured by a Jominy test: a round metal bar of standard size (indicated in the top image) is transformed to 100% austenite through heat treatment, and is then quenched on one end with room-temperature water. The cooling rate will be highest at the end being quenched, and will decrease as distance from the end increases. Subsequent to cooling a flat surface is ground on the test piece and the hardenability is then found by measuring the hardness along the bar. The farther away from the quenched end that the hardness extends, the higher the hardenability. This information is plotted on a hardenability graph.\n\nThe Jominy end-quench test was invented by Walter E. Jominy (1893-1976) and A.L. Boegehold, metallurgists in the Research Laboratories Division of General Motors Corp., in 1937. For his pioneering work in heat treating, Jominy was recognized by the American Society for Metals (ASM) with its Albert Sauveur Achievement Award in 1944. Jominy served as president of ASM in 1951.\n\n"}

It is computed from five components. The first three components are numeric ratings of the moisture content of litter and other fine fuels, the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth, and the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. The last two components are the rate of fire spread if fuel is available for combustion, and the frontal fire intensity.\n\nThe essential information needed to calculate this index is:\n\nThe FWI was adapted for use in Australia, with large FWI values most commonly associated with high wind speeds, followed secondly by low relative humidities and then thirdly by high temperatures.\n\nThis index is computed for 40 zones of France, three are in the Landes (département with the biggest forest of France). Météo France sends the IFM to civil defense authorities, which allows the prepositioning of men and vehicles, especially air units. The computed index is revised every year to take new data into account.\n\nEach provincial forest fire prevention authority is calculating the FWI for the different regions under their jurisdiction. The \"Daily Severity Rating\" (DSR) is a numeric rating of the difficulty of controlling fires, based on the Fire Weather Index, that is calculated afterward.

The document was inspired by the Bottom-Up Review that was also performed by the DoD. The general theme for the first NPR was to lead and hedge threats from abroad. The review was organized around 6 areas of focus: Role of nuclear weapons, nuclear force structure, nuclear force options, nuclear safety and security, and relationship between US nuclear posture, counter-proliferation policy and threat reduction policy with the former Soviet Union. This review was led by a group of 5 members, headed by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear security and Counterproliferation Ashton Carter and Major General John Admire. Due to the differences in experiences between the two chairs of the review, this lead to internal conflict as the NPR was being worked through. After enough discussions, however, the 1994 NPR was approved by President Clinton and published on September 18, 1994.\n\nThe next NPR of 2002 was the second of these reviews of US nuclear forces undertaken by the US Department of Defense. The final report is National Security Classified and submitted to the Congress of the United States. The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review also included components requiring the \"Pentagon to draft contingency plans for the use of nuclear weapons against at least seven countries, naming not only Russia and the \"axis of evil\"—Iraq, Iran, and North Korea—but also China, Libya and Syria.\" Only portions of the report have been released, such as the foreword for the 2002 NPR. In this report, there is a proposal for a new US nuclear triad based on: offensive strike systems, defenses, and a revitalized defense structure. The NPR also calls for the development of new types of nuclear weapons, as well as retaining 2000 deployed strategic nuclear weapons. Critics have argued that this does the opposite of hedging against global threats and inadvertently promotes nuclear proliferation.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review was preceded by high expectations because of his 2009 speech in Prague, Czech Republic where he prominently outlined a vision of a world without nuclear weapons. His NPR was hoped by observers to make concrete moves toward this goal. The finished 2010 policy renounces development of any new nuclear weapons such as the bunker-busters proposed by the Bush administration, and for the first time rules out a nuclear attack against non-nuclear-weapon states who are in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This rule specifically excludes Iran and North Korea.\n\nAs part of the implementation of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, the US Government is reviewing its nuclear deterrence requirements and nuclear plans to ensure that they are aligned to address today's threats. Rose Gottemoeller, US Acting Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, said in early June 2012 that the United States was considering what forces the United States needed to maintain for strategic stability and deterrence, including extended deterrence and assurance to US Allies and partners. Based on this analysis the United States would develop proposals for potential further reductions in its nuclear stockpile.\n\nWith Donald Trump's election came a new nuclear posture review headed by Secretary of Defense James Mattis. The 2018 NPR maintains the need for a nuclear triad in the US defense strategy. There are a variety of options that have been proposed by the 2018 NPR. One of the statements made include a need to close a gap in the nuclear arsenal with low-yield nuclear weapons. This suggests that the US would consider using nuclear weapons if necessary on a smaller-scale regional conflict rather than all-out nuclear war. Other things to note from the 2018 NPR include a need to develop sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) to bolster the SSBN portion of the triad. The review also states the US's intention to not ratify the CTBT and rejects the idea of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Despite these recommendations and stances, the 2018 NPR is argued to be similar rather than different from previous NPRs. The NPR maintains that nuclear weapons are still meant to serve as a deterrent, which is the goal of these proposed actions to modernize the US nuclear arsenal. \n\n\n"}

It measures the airflow through the bronchi and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. Peak expiratory flow is typically measured in units of liters per minute (L/min).\n\nPeak flow readings are higher when patients are well, and lower when the airways are constricted. From changes in recorded values, patients and doctors may determine lung functionality, the severity of asthma symptoms, and treatment.\n\nMeasurement of PEFR requires training to correctly use a meter and the normal expected value depends on the patient's sex, age, and height. It is classically reduced in obstructive lung disorders such as asthma.\n\nDue to the wide range of 'normal' values and the high degree of variability, peak flow is not the recommended test to identify asthma. However, it can be useful in some circumstances.\n\nA small portion of people with asthma may benefit from regular peak flow monitoring. When monitoring is recommended, it is usually done in addition to reviewing asthma symptoms and frequency of reliever medication use.\n\nWhen peak flow is being monitored regularly, the results may be recorded on a peak flow chart. \n\nIt is important to use the same peak flow meter every time.\n\nTo interpret the significance of peak expiratory flow measurements, a comparison is made to reference (normal, predicted) values based on measurements taken from the general population. Various reference values have been published in the literature and vary by population, ethnic group, age, sex, height and weight of the patient. For this reason, tables or charts are used to determine the normal value for a particular individual. More recently, medical calculators have been developed to calculate predicted values for peak expiratory flow. There are a number of non-equivalent scales used in the interpretation of peak expiratory flow.\n\nSome examples of Reference Values are given below. There is a wide natural variation in results from healthy test subjects.\n\nIn 2004 the UK switched from the original Wright scale to the newer, more accurate European scale. Wright values may be converted to the EU scale using the following formula:\n\nThe reverse calculation is:\n\nWhere formula_3 is the value in the Wright scale.\n\nThese formulas have also been trended over time in both rural and metropolitan areas both as air quality studies and as studies on asthma due to the Peak Flow measurement's accuracy as a predictor of mortality and poor prognosis.\n\nMeasurements may be based on 1 second or less but are usually reported as a volume per minute. Electronic devices will sample the flow and multiply the sample volume(Litres) by 60, divided by the sample time(seconds) for a result measured in L/minute : formula_4\n\nThe highest of three readings is used as the recorded value of the Peak Expiratory Flow Rate. It may be plotted out on graph paper charts together with a record of symptoms or using peak flow charting software. This allows patients to self-monitor and pass information back to their doctor or nurse.\n\nPeak flow readings are often classified into 3 zones of measurement according to the American Lung Association; green, yellow, and red. Doctors and health practitioners can develop an asthma management plan based on the green-yellow-red zones.\n\nThe measurement of peak expiratory flow was pioneered by Martin Wright, who produced the first meter specifically designed to measure this index of lung function. Since the original design of instrument was introduced in the late 1950s, and the subsequent development of a more portable, lower cost version (the \"Mini-Wright\" peak flow meter), other designs and copies have become available across the world.\n\n\n"}

Thanks to this impressive performance, Jancker spent only one season with the Austrian club before being brought back to Germany to play for FC Bayern Munich.\n\nJancker's time at Bayern between 1996 and 2002 was the best period of his career, a spell which included four Bundesliga titles and victory in the 2001 UEFA Champions League. At Bayern, Jancker was partnered with the Brazilian inside-forward Giovane Élber, often rated as one of the Bundesliga's best attacking players.\n\nJancker left Bayern for Italian side Udinese in 2002, but the move was not a success; over two seasons and 35 games, the forward registered only two goals. Jancker was said to be \"too slow and predictable for Serie A\" by one football website. In 2004, Jancker returned to Germany with Kaiserslautern and showed a slight improvement in form, netting five times in 25 games. In 2004, he also scored six goals in Kaiserslautern's 15–0 first round DFB-Pokal win against FC Schönberg 95, still a record for any player in the competition. This was an improvement over his own previous joint record of five, which he had scored for Bayern Munich against DJK Waldberg in the latter's 16–1 first round cup defeat in 1997. Following the relegation of Kaiserslautern in May 2006, Jancker signed for Chinese team Shanghai Shenhua.\n\nAfter poor performances, he was dropped in October, and agreed to join SV Mattersburg in the winter transfer window. In June 2009 it was announced that Mattersburg did not want to work with Jancker any further because of his physical condition. In February 2010, he announced his retirement at the end of the current season.\n\nHis performances alongside Elber caught the eye of German national coach Erich Ribbeck, who included Jancker in his international squad for Euro 2000.\n\nInstantly recognisable to European football fans, the invariably shaven-headed forward has generally failed to replicate his club form when playing for the national side. A possible explanation for his poorly-regarded international performances might be that the German national team lacked a skilful strike partner in the Élber mould. Whatever the reason, Jancker never impressed for Germany; although he was included in Rudi Völler's squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup – scoring a goal in the team's opening 8–0 win over Saudi Arabia, he was dropped from the team shortly after the tournament and was never recalled. His German international scoring record stands at roughly a goal every three games. He is known for scoring in Germany's 5–1 defeat to England in 2001.\n\nA powerful and tenacious yet slow striker, Jancker was physically very large for a footballer, standing at . His height and strength proved to be an advantage when playing as a target man, as displayed during his most successful days at FC Bayern Munich. Jancker was known for being an unusual center forward, being weak in the air despite his huge frame, but showing a surprising control of the ball, especially featuring a polished back-to-the-goal game, good link-up play, and a touch for scoring with his hard right-footed shot – always doing the most intelligent and simple things on the field, courtesy of his awareness. He also struggled with injuries throughout his career.\n\nOn 18 February 2010, the former international striker took over the U14 team of SC Neusiedl, the club from his Austrian home town. Additionally he works for the first team in the Austrian Regional League East as an individual coach. On 27 April 2010, Jancker announced that he will work as the new coach of the Under 15 of his former club SK Rapid Wien, starting 1 July 2010. In April 2013, he became assistant coach of the club's Austrian Bundesliga team.\n\nJancker became the head coach of SV Horn in June 2017. He was fired on 28 November 2018.\n\nIn April 2019, he was appointed manager of FC Marchfeld Donauauen, starting from 1 May 2019.\n\nRapid Wien\n\nBayern Munich\n\n"}

It is roughly centred on a pub named the Goat Grill, at the intersection of Goatstown Road and Taney Road, where there has been a pub since the early 18th century.\n\nGoatstown got its name from the fact that formerly goats were bred there; in the 19th century it was popular to travel to Dundrum and nearby Goatstown as goat's milk was considered to be excellent for those suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nA number of roads pass through Goatstown. At the crossroads the R112 passes from west (Taney Road) to east (Mount Anville Road), to the south is the R825 (Goatstown Road) and to the north is the R133 (Lower Kilmacud Road).

They appeared in various classic Mexican films and made many appearances on nationally syndicated programs in Mexico and the United States.\n\nThe band was formed in 1960 in Linares, Nuevo León by Homero Guerrero. The idea of the name \"Cadetes\" came from the fact that, as a child, Guerrero's dream was to attend a military academy. However, because of his family's financial problems, he decided to devote himself to music. He began playing a bajo sexto, singing at family parties, festivals, schools and in the main square of Linares.\n\nIn 1961 Guerrero added an accordionist, Adan Moreno. They began playing around Linares, and became known as Los Cadetes de Linares.\n\nIn 1967 Moreno left the band due to disagreements with the group. In 1968 Samuel Zapata became the group's second accordionist. Homero and Samuel made their first recordings for Discos del Valle, a record company from Houston, Texas. Their early singles included \"Sácame, Sácame\", \"El Ranchero\", \"El Rogón\", \"Estoy Pagando\", and \"Quiero Que Sepas\". Zapata left the group for family reasons in 1968.\n\nIn late 1968 Candelario Villareal joined as the third accordionist for the band. Homero and Candelario made local performances throughout Monterrey, Linares, and southern Texas.\n\nThe band subsequently added Lupe Tijerina. Guerrero and Tijerina made a recording in 1974 with of corrido composed by Lupe Tijerina called \"Los Dos Amigos\". The band subsequently began touring across Mexico and the southwestern United States, as well as places such as Chicago and Los Angeles with large Mexican communities. With the addition of Lupe Tijerina's style, the band began to find chart success. The band's hits in this era included \"Dos Coronas a mi Madre\", \"Las Tres Tumbas\", \"Pueblito\", \"Regalo de Reyes\", and \"Polvo Maldito\".\n\nOn February 19, 1982, Guerrero died in a car accident on the road from Monterrey to Reynosa. His funeral was attended by thousands of people.\n\nAfter Guerrero's death, Ernesto Baez took his place in the group. Lupe Tijerina had success with Cadetes de Linares in that same year with his bolero, \"Adiós Amigo Del Alma\". After the group's original drummer took over as the main vocalist and guitarist, Baez and Tijerina played sold out stadiums and appeared on \"Siempre en Domingo\" and the Johnny Canales Show.\n\nWhen Baez left the band in 2006, Tijerina asked Rosendo Cantu to join. The band broke up the following year, but Cantu, seeing that Los Cadetes de Linares's contract had ended with Ramex Records, applied and bought the legal rights to perform as the authentic Cadetes de Linares, instead of Tijerina. Cantu and Tijerina both formed their own bands. Eventually, after litigation over the name at the USPTO, Ramex Records ended up owning the trademark \"Los Cadetes de Linares\". The label later sold the trademark to Zamic Records of Houston, Texas.\n\nMany bands subsequently formed with the name \"Cadetes de Linares\", to Tijerina's irritation. Tijerina died from respiratory problems shortly after performing the opening song at a concert in Ciudad Fernández, San Luis Potosí on July 5, 2016.\n"}

Hence, the vadose zone extends from the top of the ground surface to the water table.\n\nWater in the vadose zone has a pressure head less than atmospheric pressure, and is retained by a combination of adhesion (\"funiculary groundwater\"), and capillary action (\"capillary groundwater\"). If the vadose zone envelops soil, the water contained therein is termed soil moisture. In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at a pressure less than atmospheric. The vadose zone does not include the area that is still saturated above the water table, often referred to as the capillary fringe. \n\nMovement of water within the vadose zone is studied within soil physics and hydrology, particularly hydrogeology, and is of importance to agriculture, contaminant transport, and flood control. The Richards equation is often used to mathematically describe the flow of water, which is based partially on Darcy's law. Groundwater recharge, which is an important process that refills aquifers, generally occurs through the vadose zone from precipitation.\n\nThe vadose zone is the undersaturated portion of the subsurface that lies above the groundwater table. The soil and rock in the vadose zone are not fully saturated with water; that is, the pores within them contain air as well as water. In some places the vadose zone is absent, as is common where there are lakes and marshes, and in some places it is hundreds of meters thick, as is common in arid regions.\n\nUnlike the aquifers of the underlying water-saturated phreatic zone, the vadose zone is not a source of readily available water for human consumption. It is of great importance in providing water and nutrients that are vital to the biosphere, however, and it is intensively used for the cultivation of plants, construction of buildings, and disposal of waste.\n\nThe vadose zone is often the main factor controlling water movement from the land surface to the aquifer. Thus it strongly affects the rate of aquifer recharge and is critical for the use and management of groundwater. Flow rates and chemical reactions in the vadose zone also control whether, where, and how fast contaminants enter groundwater supplies. Understanding of vadose-zone processes is therefore crucial in determining the amount and quality of groundwater that is available for human use.\n\nIn speleology, cave passages formed in the vadose zone tend to be canyon-like in shape, as the water dissolves bedrock on the floor of the passage. Passages created in completely water-filled conditions are called phreatic passages and tend to be circular in cross-section.\n\n\n"}

It was the first game in the \"Zork\" trilogy and was released for a wide range of computer systems, followed by \"Zork II\" and \"Zork III\". It was Infocom's first game, and sold 378,000 copies by 1986.\n\nThe game takes place in the Zork calendar year 948 GUE (although the passage of time is not notable in gameplay). The player steps into the deliberately vague role of an \"adventurer\". The game begins near a white house in a small, self-contained area. Although the player is given little instruction, the house provides an obvious point of interest.\n\nWhen the player enters the house, it yields a number of intriguing objects, including a brass, battery-powered lantern, an empty trophy case, and an Elvish sword of great antiquity. Beneath the rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar, which is revealed to be one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land known as the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters a colorful host of dangerous enemies, including deadly grues who only prey on their victims in the dark, an axe-wielding troll, a giant cyclops who flees in terror at the mention of Odysseus, a vampire bat that can drop the player anywhere in the mine if encountered, evil spirits guarding the Entrance to Hades, and a nimble-fingered thief armed with a stiletto who makes mapping the maze difficult by removing or scattering any items that the player might drop to leave a trail.\n\nThe ultimate goal of \"Zork I\" is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two complex mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3.\n\nPlacing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 350 points and grants the rank of \"Master Adventurer.\" An ancient map with further instructions then magically appears in the trophy case. These instructions provide access to a stone barrow. The entrance to the barrow is the end of \"Zork I\" and the beginning of \"Zork II\".\n\nThere are 28 ways for the player to die. It is possible to score all 350 points in 223 moves (and win the game completely in 228 moves) by exploiting a bug.\n\nInfocom did not begin their tradition of including feelies, or extra items related to a game, until the 1982 release \"Deadline\". Later re-releases of the game, however, were packaged with:\n\nAlthough the back of the \"Zork I\" \"Grey box\" depicted a zorkmid coin included with the other feelies, production difficulties led to the coins' omission from the packages. Zorkmid coins were not included as feelies until the release of the Zork Trilogy boxed set.\n\nThe original version of \"Zork I\" was published by Personal Software and simply called \"Zork\". It was distributed in clear plastic bags containing only the game disk and a 36-page booklet. Infocom's first \"self-published\" version of \"Zork I\" was in the so-called \"Folio\" format which included a single piece of paper describing how to run the game. The feelies noted above were only introduced when \"Zork I\" was re-released in the \"Grey box\" format.\n\nThe opening text of \"Zork I\" is among the most notable descriptions in video games:\nThis is quite simplistic when compared to Infocom's later games, many of which started with screens full of introductory text.\n\nSeveral of the game's situations and descriptions have become iconic within the field of interactive fiction, such as the brass lantern and the \"Elvish sword of great antiquity\".\n\n\"Zork I\" also introduced the notable grue, a \"sinister, lurking presence\" who kills adventurers who go exploring in the dark. Grues appeared (or, at least, were mentioned) in many subsequent Infocom adventures, right up to the 1997 graphic adventure \"Zork Grand Inquisitor\", published by Activision.\n\n\"Zork I\"s sales surprised Infocom by rising, not falling, over time. Computer dealers demonstrated its parser to customers as example of what their products could do. They sold the game as an essential accessory to those purchasing new computers, including the DEC Rainbow, TI Professional, and others that most people did not see as game machines. It was the best-selling game of 1982, with 32,000 copies sold by the first half of that year; almost 100,000 copies in 1983,—\"Inc.\" reported that the game had been a best seller for four years—more than 150,000 copies in 1984, comprising more than 20% of Infocom's sales that year; and a total of 378,987 copies by 1986. \"InfoWorld\" reported in April 1984 that \"Zork I\" \"has returned to the top of the sales charts two years after its release\". Based on sales and market-share data, \"Video\" listed it fifth on the magazine's list of best selling video games in both February and March 1985, and \"II Computing\" listed \"Zork I\" fourth on the magazine's overall list of top Apple II software as of October–November 1985, and first on the games list.\n\n\"BYTE\" declared in 1981 that \"No single advance in the science of Adventure has been as bold and exciting\" as \"Zork\". The magazine praised the sophisticated parser and quality of writing, stating, \"That the program is entertaining, eloquent, witty, and precisely written is almost beside the point ... \"Zork\" can be felt and touched—\"experienced\", if you will—through the care and attention to detail the authors have rendered.\" It concluded, \"Somebody, please, let me know when [the sequel is] done.\" Jerry Pournelle wrote in the magazine in 1983 that he played the game with his sons, stating that \"If you liked Adventure and wanted more after you solved the Colossal Cave, I guarantee you'll love Zork\". Jon Mishcon reviewed \"Zork\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 40. Mishcon commented that \"Other than the absence of graphics, this game has no weak points I can find. Although [the price] is expensive I believe this is a first rate game and well worth every penny.\" \"80 Micro\" called \"Zork\" \"complicated and sophisticated ... a joy to play\". It praised the documentation (\"Take it from a rank amateur; these instructions are clear and easy to follow\"), and wondered if the game could be solved because \"the program lets you do pretty much what you want to do, even if the consequences are much less than desirable, it leaves open marvelous opportunities\". The magazine concluded by hoping that \"we can expect a second part sometime soon\". \"The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984\" gave the game an overall A+ rating, calling it \"THE definitive adventure game\".\n\nIn 1992, \"Computer Gaming World\" added \"Zork I\" to its Hall of Fame, waiving the normal criteria \"in favor of honoring this venerable classic.\" In 1996, the magazine listed \"Zork I\" at #13 among the top 150 best games of all-time. The editors wrote, \"This seminal Infocom text adventure combined challenging puzzles, wonderful descriptive prose, and a touch of humor to create a rich universe that existed not in SVGA graphics, but within your head.\" On March 12, 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported that it was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including \"Zork\".\n\n\"Zork I\" was one of five Infocom games that were re-released in Solid Gold format with in-game hints.\n\nInfocom allowed the distribution of the early Fortran version, therefore source code is available. Various Public domain software ports are available in various repositories.\n\nThere is also an abridged version, called Mini-Zork I, dated November 24, 1987. Mini-Zork was released free of charge as a promotion.\n\nA German language version was developed, but never released. An unfinished version of this story file, dated January 13, 1988, has made its way into public circulation. The German is evidently non-native, containing many spelling and grammar errors. It is known that Jeff O'Neill worked on this version.\n\nA remastered version of was first released by Japanese software development company SystemSoft for the NEC PC-9801 in March 1991. There are differences in this enhanced remake: the game recognizes verb commands typed in kana (Japanese syllable system) or Latin alphabet. For convenience, some of the most common verb commands (Look, Take, etc.) can be accessed by pressing a corresponding button, but the player still has to type the name of an object. This remake also helps the player to interact with the environment by displaying a list of objects after the player has typed a command. Also, unlike the original, the remake contains enhanced graphics, especially in the list of objects on which the text is super-imposed. Another remastered version was released by Activision and Shoeisha in Japan for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1996. This version also includes graphics (with the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), sound effects, auto-mapping, and music by Yuzo Koshiro. Neither version was ever released outside Japan.\n\nThe game is playable in \"\" with the code \"ZORK\". To do this, Mason (the main character) needs to get up from the chair. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users need to pull L2 and R2 (LT and RT on Xbox 360) rapidly. Windows players need to press the space bar rapidly and Wii players must shake the controls (Wiimote + nunchuck control scheme). After Mason gets up from his chair, he must walk to the left and use the old computer, which is behind the chair. To play Zork, type \"zork\" into the command prompt. An achievement/trophy is also awarded for putting in the code.\n\n"}

It is the official home of football club Club América, Cruz Azul and the Mexico national football team. The stadium sits at an altitude of above sea level. With an official capacity of 87,523, it is the largest stadium in Mexico. As of 2018, the stadium also serves as the home of Cruz Azul. The National Football League (NFL) features one game at Estadio Azteca per season as a part of their International Series.\n\nRegarded as one of the most famous and iconic football stadiums in the world, it is the first to have hosted two FIFA World Cup Finals; in the 1970 World Cup Final, Brazil defeated Italy 4–1, and in the 1986 World Cup Final, Argentina defeated West Germany 3–2. It also hosted the 1986 quarter-final match between Argentina and England in which Diego Maradona scored both the \"Hand of God goal\" and the \"Goal of the Century\". The stadium also hosted the \"Game of the Century\", when Italy defeated West Germany 4–3 in extra time in one of the 1970 semifinal matches. Additionally, it is scheduled to host games in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. \n\nThe stadium was also the principal venue for the football tournament of the 1968 Summer Olympics and 1971 Women's World Cup.\n\nThe Estadio Azteca was designed by architects Pedro Ramírez Vázquez and Rafael Mijares Alcérreca and broke ground in 1961. The inaugural match was between Club América and Torino F.C. on 29 May 1966, with a capacity for 107,494 spectators. The first goal was scored by Brazilian Arlindo Dos Santos and the second one by Brazilian José Alves \"Zague\"; later, the Italians tied the game, which ended in 2–2 draw. Mexican president Gustavo Díaz Ordaz made the initial kick and FIFA president Sir Stanley Rous was the witness.\n\nA modern illumination system was inaugurated on 5 June 1966, with the first night game played between Spanish side Valencia C.F. and Necaxa. The first goal of the match was scored by Honduran José Cardona for Valencia. Roberto Martínez, aka Caña Brava, became the first Mexican to score a goal in the stadium after scoring for Necaxa. The result was a 3–1 victory for Valencia.\n\nIn 1978 the stadium hosted the final of the Copa Interamericana between América and Boca Juniors of Argentina, and would host a final again in 1990 between América and Club Olimpia of Paraguay.\n\nThe Estadio Azteca is also the site in which Pelé and Diego Maradona (during the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cup) lifted the trophy for the last time (The Jules Rimet Trophy and the current FIFA World Cup Trophy, respectively).\n\nEstadio Azteca has also been used for musical performances throughout its history. Michael Jackson (5 sold-out shows in 1993), U2 (in 2006 and 2011), Luis Miguel (in 2002), Elton John, Maná, Juan Gabriel, Gloria Estefan, Jaguares, Lenny Kravitz, *Nsync, Hanson, Ana Gabriel, and The Three Tenors all have become part of the stadium's main spectacle. The stadium has also been used for political events, including Mexican president Felipe Calderón's campaign closure in 2006, as well as religious events, such as Jehovah's Witnesses conventions, and the appearance of Pope John Paul II in 1999.\n\nIn April 2017, it was announced that starting July 2018, Cruz Azul would relocate to the Azteca on a temporary basis, due to the impending demolition of the Estadio Azul. According to club owner Guillermo Álvarez, they plan on building a new private stadium, which could take an estimated three-to-four years.\n\nThe stadium is scheduled to host games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup that will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada. It will be the third time Azteca hosts World Cup games as the 1970 and 1986 games took place at the stadium. Additionally, it is currently vying for the inaugural game with SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles as another possible venue for the game.\n\nThe stadium has undergone gradual improvements and renovations, including the replacing of seating within the stadium as well as the installation of electronic advertising boards. In May 2015, modern Panasonic LED panels were installed at the north and south ends of the stadium, replacing the phosphorous panels installed in 1998.\n\nIn February 2015, a vast renovation plan was unveiled with the intention that the completion of the project coincide with the stadium's 50th anniversary and with Club América's centenary in 2016, as well as the construction of a commercial hub outside the stadium to be completed some time in 2019. It was reported that Grupo Televisa, owners of the stadium, approved a joint-venture bid from private development firms IQ Real Estate and Alhel. The hub, named \"Foro Azteca\", would reportedly consist of a mall, office spaces, two hotels, new leisure spaces, and parking spaces for 2,500 cars. The renovations to the stadium were planned in two phases: the first saw the demolition of the restaurant and seating at the lower east stand and the construction of a new hospitality area with dining and banqueting spaces, and the second saw the construction of new media boxes and private skyboxes at the upper west stand. The renovations to the stadium were completed in November 2016. The seating capacity was ultimately reduced to 87,000 as a result of the renovations.\n\nThe name \"Azteca\" is a tribute to the Aztec heritage of Mexico City. The stadium is currently owned by Mexican multimedia conglomerate Televisa, which has a heated media rivalry with the similarly-named TV Azteca. Although there had been little to no confusion between the stadium and television network (which had only come into existence four years before in 1993), Televisa officially changed the stadium's name to Estadio Guillermo Cañedo on 20 January 1997, in tribute to , a top network executive, former Mexican Football Federation president, and a prominent member of the FIFA executive committee who had died that day. As with the similar situation with the defunct Candlestick Park in San Francisco in the United States and its sponsored names, few outside of Televisa itself took up the new name, and most of the general public probably had no thought about the stadium's ownership (much less the Televisa/Azteca rivalry) and continued to refer to the Estadio Azteca by its original (and current) name. After two of Cañedo's sons took a business interest in TV Azteca in 1998, Televisa quietly returned to referring to it solely as Estadio Azteca.\n\nKnown colloquially by the nickname \"Coloso de Santa Úrsula\", which in English translates to \"Colossus of Saint Ursula\", due to its large structure and Santa Úrsula referring to the suburb where the stadium is located.\n\nIt is served by the Azteca station on the Xochimilco Light Rail line. This line is an extension of the Mexico City metro system which begins at Metro Tasqueña station and ends in the Xochimilco Light Rail Station.\n\nTickets are available up until kick-off times from the ticket office which is located at the front of the stadium, located towards the exit ramps from the Azteca station. Prices start from as little as MXN$100 (about US$5 as of 2016), and could cost up to MXN$500 (about US$26 as of 2016) for more high-profile matches.\n\nA commemorative bronze plaque of the \"Game of the Century\" played between Italy and West Germany, as well as Diego Maradona's \"Goal of the Century\" against England.\n\nThere is also a commemorative plaque with the names of the first goal scorer in the inaugural match and in the first match played at night.\n\nEstadio Azteca has hosted a variety of international sporting competitions, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The full name refers to its capital Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell), in order to distinguish it from neighboring Mauretania Tingitana, which was ruled from Tingis (now Tangiers in Morocco).\n\nThe province had been part of the Kingdom of Mauretania and named for the Mauri people who lived there. Formerly an independent kingdom, and later a client state of Rome, it was annexed into the Empire formally during the reign of Claudius and divided into two provinces about 42 AD. A third province, named Mauretania Sitifensis, was later split off from the eastern portion during the reign of Diocletian in 293 AD. During and after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, most of the hinterland area was lost, first to the Vandal Kingdom and later to the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, with Roman administration limited to the capital of Caesarea. The land was reconquered by Rome during the reign of Justinian. In the late 580s, under the emperor Maurice, all of the Maghreb was granted to the Exarchate of Africa, and Mauretania Caesariensis became part of a new province, Mauretania Prima. The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb brought an end to Roman rule in Mauretania, which became ruled by the Umayyad Caliphate as part of Medieval Muslim Algeria.\n\nIn the middle of 1st century AD, Roman emperor Claudius divided the westernmost Roman province in Africa, named Mauretania (land of the Mauri people, hence the word Moors), into Mauretania Caesariensis (named after its capital, one of many cities simply named Caesarea after the imperial cognomen that had become a title) and Mauretania Tingitana.\nMauretania Caesariensis included eight colonies founded by the Emperor Augustus : Cartennas, Gunugu, Igilgili, Rusguniae, Rusazu, Saldae, Zuccabar, Tubusuctu; two by the Emperor Claudius: Caesarea formerly the capital of Juba, who gave it this name in honour of his patron Augustus, and Oppidum Novum; one by the Emperor Nerva: Setifis; and in later times, Arsenaria, Bida, Siga, Aquae Calidae, Quiza Xenitana, Rusucurru, Auzia, Gilva, Icosium and Tipasa in all 21 well-known colonies, besides several \"municipia\" and \"oppida Latina\".\n\nUnder Diocletian's Tetrarchy reform, the easternmost part was broken off from Mauretania Caesariensis as a separate small province, \"Mauretania Sitifensis\", called after its inland capital Sitifis (now Sétif) with a significant port at Saldae (presently Béjaïa).\n\nAt the time of Diocletian and Constantine the Great, both Sitifensis and Caesariensis were assigned to the administrative Diocese of Africa, in the praetorian prefecture of Italy, while Tingitana was an outpost of the Diocese of Spain.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western part of the Roman Empire, a Germanic Vandal Kingdom was founded, but the remaining Eastern Empire (now known to historians as the Byzantine Empire) recaptured the area around 533, but most of Mauretania Caesariensis remained under the control of local Moorish rulers such as Mastigas, and it was not until the 560s and 570s that Byzantine control was established in the interior.\n\nDuring the reign of Maurice, the empire was reorganized and a number of Exarchates were founded, among them the Exarchate of Africa which included Mauretania, among other territories. Mauretania Sitifensis was re-merged back into this province, and was granted the name \"Mauretania Prima\".\n\nThe Muslim conquest of the Maghreb for the caliphate under the Umayyad dynasty meant the end of the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa and Late Antique Roman culture there and Mauretania Caesariensis became part of the westernmost Islamic province called Maghreb.\n\nCaesarea was a major center of Judaism before 330, and Sitifis was one of the centres of the soldier cult of Mithraic mysteries. Christianity spread throughout in the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nAmong the ruling class, Trinitarian Christianity was replaced by Arianism under the Germanic kingdom of the Vandals, which was established in 430, when the Vandals crossed the Strait of Gibraltar.\nAncient episcopal sees of Mauretania Caesariensis listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees:\nThe principal exports from Caesariensis were purple dyes and valuable woods; and the Amazigh or Mauri were highly regarded by the Romans as soldiers, especially light cavalry. They produced one of Trajan's best generals, Lusius Quietus, and the emperor Macrinus.\n\n\n"}

Harrison is also the former Canadian Member of Parliament for the riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, a riding that encompasses the northern half of the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nBorn in Saskatoon, Harrison joined the Reform Party in 1996 and served in numerous positions in Reform, the Canadian Alliance, and the Conservative Party of Canada, including time as a political staffer in the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Ottawa. He worked for Stephen Harper's leadership campaign in 2002, and from 2002 to 2004 he served on the national executive of the Canadian Alliance. During this time Harrison was also enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law. He graduated from that institution with a Bachelor of Law degree in the spring of 2004. He later graduated with a Master's in Public Administration from the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy.\n\nHe was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in the 2004 federal election. Harrison was defeated in the 2006 federal election by Liberal opponent Gary Merasty. On election night, the margin was 106 votes, which was reduced to 73 when election official reviewed the count sheets. He challenged the result, alleging threats and ballot stuffing by the Liberals, but a judicial recount confirmed Merasty's victory, by a reduced margin of 67 votes. On February 20, Harrison announced that he would not pursue the matter further.\n\nHarrison was cited as being part of the Conservative Party of Canada's alleged In-and-Out scheme during the 2006 election.\n\nHarrison was acclaimed as the Saskatchewan Party's candidate in Meadow Lake in June 2007.\n\nHe was initially declared defeated in the 2007 election, narrowly losing to incumbent MLA Maynard Sonntag in Meadow Lake, but was subsequently declared elected after a count error was noted the following day. The count of absentee ballots on November 19 confirmed Harrison's victory.\n\nFollowing the election, Harrison was named legislative secretary to the minister of energy and resources, northern resources and oilsands development. On May 29, 2009, Premier Brad Wall appointed Harrison to the Executive Council of Saskatchewan as Minister of Municipal Affairs. On June 29, 2010, he was moved to Minister of Enterprise and Minister Responsible for Trade in a cabinet shuffle.\n\nHarrison was re-elected in the 2011 election. Following the election, he was given an additional role as Government House Leader. Harrison was dropped from cabinet in May 2012, but retained his position as Government House Leader.\n\nOn June 5, 2014, Harrison returned to cabinet when appointed associate minister of the economy responsible for trade, tourism, innovation and immigration.\n\nOn August 20, 2017, Harrison announced his bid for the leadership of the Saskatchewan Party just days after party leader and Premier Brad Wall announced that he was retiring from politics. However, Harrison withdrew from the race on September 1 and announced he would support another candidate, Scott Moe, who on January 27, 2018 became the 15th Premier of Saskatchewan.\n\nNote: Conservative vote is compared to the total of the Canadian Alliance vote and Progressive Conservative vote in the 2000 election.\n\n"}

{"id": "1834924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834924", "title": "Spoiled child", "text": "Spoiled child\n\nA spoiled child or spoiled brat is a derogatory term aimed at children who exhibit behavioral problems from being overindulged by their parents or other caregivers. Children and teens who are perceived as spoiled may be described as \"overindulged\", \"grandiose\", \"narcissistic\" or \"egocentric-regressed\". Perception is important to take into account, because when the child has a neurological condition such as autism, ADHD or intellectual disability, observers may judge them as \"spoiled\" without understanding the whole picture. There is no accepted scientific definition of what \"spoiled\" means, and professionals are often unwilling to use the label because it is considered vague and derogatory. Being spoiled is not recognized as a mental disorder in any of the medical manuals, such as the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV, or its successor, the DSM-5.\n\nRichard Weaver, in his work \"Ideas Have Consequences\", introduced the term “spoiled child psychology” in 1948. In 1989, Bruce McIntosh coined the term the \"spoiled child syndrome\". The syndrome is characterized by \"excessive, self-centered, and immature behavior\". It includes lack of consideration for other people, recurrent temper tantrums, an inability to handle the delay of gratification, demands for having one's own way, obstructiveness, and manipulation to get their way. McIntosh attributed the syndrome to \"the failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits\", but others, such as Aylward, note that temperament is probably a contributory factor. It is important to note that the temper tantrums are \"recurrent\". McIntosh observes that \"many of the problem behaviors that cause parental concern are unrelated to spoiling as properly understood\". Children may have occasional temper tantrums without them falling under the umbrella of \"spoiled\". Extreme cases of spoiled child syndrome, in contrast, will involve \"frequent\" temper tantrums, physical aggression, defiance, destructive behavior, and refusal to comply with even the simple demands of daily tasks. This can be similar to the profile of children diagnosed with Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is part of the autism spectrum.\n\n\nChildren with underlying medical or mental health problems may exhibit some of the symptoms. Indeed, where the difficulties are not predicated in the parental-child nexus, many loving parents may be judged as \"spoiling\" instead of affirmed. Speech or hearing disorders, and attention deficit disorder, may lead to children's failing to understand the limits set by parents. Children who have recently experienced a stressful event, such as the separation of the parents (divorce) or the birth or death of a close family relative, may also exhibit some or all of the symptoms. Children of parents who themselves have psychiatric disorders may manifest some of the symptoms, because the parents behave erratically, sometimes failing to perceive their children's behavior correctly, and thus fail to properly or consistently define limits of normal behavior for them.\n\nParents can seek advice, support, and encouragement to empower them in parenthood from diverse sources.\n\nTreatment by a physician involves assessing parental competence, and whether the parents set limits correctly and consistently. Physicians should rule out dysfunction in the family, referring dysfunctional families for family therapy and dysfunctional parents for parenting skills training, and counsel parents in methods for modifying their child's behavior.\n\nIn early infancy, a baby signals desire for food, contact, and comfort by crying. This behavior should be viewed as a distress signal indicating that some biological need is not being met. Although parents sometimes worry about spoiling their children by giving them too much attention, specialists in child development maintain that babies cannot be spoiled in the first six months of life. During the first year, children are developing a sense of basic trust and attachment. In general, the more attention and care they receive from their parents, the better.\n\nAlfred Adler (1870–1937) believed that \"only children\" were likely to experience a variety of problems from their situation. Adler theorized that because only children have no rivals for their parents' affection, they will become pampered and spoiled, particularly by their mother. He suggested that this could later cause interpersonal difficulties if the person is not universally liked and admired.\n\nA 1987 quantitative review of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits contradicted Adler's theory. This research found no evidence of any \"spoilage\" or other pattern of maladjustment in only children. The major finding was that only children are not very different from children with siblings. The main exception to this was the finding that only children are generally higher in achievement motivation. A second analysis revealed that only children, first-borns, and children with only one sibling score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.\n\nSpoiling in early childhood tends to create characteristic reactions that persist, fixed, into later life. These can cause significant social problems. Spoiled children may have difficulty coping with situations such as teachers scolding them or refusing to grant extensions on homework assignments, playmates refusing to allow them to play with their toys and playmates refusing playdates with them, a loss in friends, failure in employment, and failure with personal relationships. As adults, spoiled children may experience problems with anger management, professionalism, and personal relationships; a link with adult psychopathy has been observed.\n\n\n"}

It is located at the junction of the R577 and R578 regional roads.\n\nBallydesmond was established in the 1830s as a model village, and named Kingwilliamstown after King William IV of the United Kingdom. It had formerly been known as Tooreenkeogh. In 1951, it was officially renamed \"Ballydesmond\", an anglicisation of the Irish name \"Baile Deasumhan\". This is thought to refer to legendary freedom fighter, the 15th Earl of Desmond, who is believed to have taken refuge in the nearby hills. However, Kingwilliamstown remained the official name of the townland.\n\nDaniel Buckley, Hannah Riordan and Bridget Delia Bradley from Ballydesmond survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic.\n\nThe Tureengarriffe ambush occurred near Ballydesmond, where a number of British army officers were killed during the Irish War of Independence by untrained members of the local flying column of the Irish Republican Army.

The territory stretched from the northern peninsula opposite Gibraltar, to Sala Colonia (or Chellah) and Volubilis to the south, and as far east as the Mulucha (or Malva) river. Its capital city was Tingis, which is the modern Tangier. Other major cities of the province were Iulia Valentia Banasa, Septem, Rusadir, Lixus and Tamuda.\n\nAfter the death in 40 AD of Ptolemy of Mauretania, the last Ptolemaic ruler of the Kingdom of Mauretania, in about 44 AD Roman Emperor Claudius annexed the kingdom to the Roman Empire and partitioned it into two Roman provinces: Mauretania Tingitana; and Mauretania Caesariensis. The Mulucha (Moulouya River), located around 60 km west of modern Oran, Algeria, became the border separating them.\n\nThe Roman occupation did not extend very far into the continent. In the far west, the southern limit of imperial rule was Volubilis, which was ringed with military camps such as Tocolosida slightly to the south east and Ain Chkour to the north west, and a fossatum or defensive ditch. On the Atlantic coast Sala Colonia was protected by another ditch and a rampart and a line of watchtowers.\nThis was not a continuous line of fortifications: there is no evidence of a defensive wall like the one that protected the turbulent frontier in Britannia at the other extremity of the Roman Empire. Rather, it was a network of forts and ditches that seems to have functioned as a filter. The limes – the word from which the English word “limit” is derived – protected the areas that were under direct Roman control by funnelling contacts with the interior through the major settlements, regulating the links between the nomads and transhumants with the towns and farms of the occupied areas.\nThe same people lived on both sides of these limes, although the population was quite small. Volubilis had perhaps twenty thousand inhabitants at most in the second century. On the evidence of inscriptions, only around ten to twenty per cent of them were of European origin, mainly Spanish; the rest were local.\n\nRoman historians (like Ptolemy) considered all of Morocco north of the Atlas Mountains part of the Roman Empire, because in the times of Augustus, Mauretania was a vassal state and its rulers (like Juba II) controlled all the areas south of Volubilis. The effective control of Roman legionaries, however, was up to the area of Sala Colonia (the castra \"Exploratio Ad Mercurios\", south of Sala Colonia, is the southernmost Roman settlement discovered until now). Some historians, like Leo Africanus, believe the Roman frontier reached the area of Casablanca, founded by the Romans as a port named \"Anfa\". Indeed, the modern city of Azemmour in central Morocco lies on the ancient \"Azama\", a trading port of Phoenician and later Roman origins. Still today can be seen the remains of a Roman deposit for grain in the so-called \"Portuguese cisterns\".\n\nPliny the Elder described in some detail the area south of the Atlas Mountains, when Gaius Suetonius Paulinus undertook a military expedition in 41:\n\nDuring the reign of the Numidian King Juba II, Emperor Augustus had already founded three colonias (with Roman citizens) in Mauretania close to the Atlantic coast: Iulia Constantia Zilil, Iulia Valentia Banasa and Iulia Campestris Babba.\n\nThis western part of Mauretania was to become the province called Mauretania Tingitana shortly afterwards. The region remained a part of the Roman Empire until 429, when the Vandals overran the area and Roman administrative presence came to an end.\nThe most important city of Mauretania Tingitana was Volubilis. This city was the administrative and economic center of the province in western Roman Africa. The fertile lands of the province produced many commodities such as grain and olive oil, which were exported to Rome, contributing to the province's wealth and prosperity. Archaeology has documented the presence of a Jewish community in the Roman period.\n\nThe principal exports from Mauretania Tingitana were purple dyes and valuable woods. Tingitana also supplied Rome with agricultural goods and animals, such as lions and leopards. The native Mauri were highly regarded and recruited by the Romans as soldiers, especially as light cavalry. Clementius Valerius Marcellinus is recorded as the governor (praeses) between 24 October 277 and 13 April 280.\n\nAccording to tradition, the martyrdom of St Marcellus took place on 28 July 298 at Tingis (Tangier). During the Tetrarchy (Emperor Diocletian's reform of Roman governmental structures in 297), Mauretania Tingitana became part of the Diocese of Hispaniae, 'the Spains', and, by extension, part of the Praetorian prefecture of Gaul. Mauretania Caesariensis was in the Diocese of Africa. Lucilius Constantius is recorded as governor (praeses) in the late fourth century.\nThe \"Notitia Dignitatum\" shows also, in its military organisation, a \"Comes Tingitaniae\" with a field army composed of two legions, three vexillations, and two auxilia palatina. Flavius Memorius held this office (comes) at some point during the middle of the fourth century. However, it is implicit in the source material that there was a single military command for both of the Mauretanian provinces, with a \"Dux Mauretaniae\" (a lower rank) controlling seven cohorts and one ala.\n\nThe Germanic Vandals established themselves in the province of Baetica in 422 AD under their king, Gunderic, and, from there, they carried out raids on Mauretania Tingitana. In 427 AD, the \"Comes Africae\", Bonifacius, rejected an order of recall from the Emperor Valentinian III, and he defeated an army sent against him. He was less fortunate when a second force was sent in 428 AD. In that year, Gunderic was succeeded by Gaiseric, and Bonifacius invited Gaiseric into Africa, providing a fleet to enable the passage of the Vandals to Tingis and Septem (Ceuta). Bonifacius intended to confine the Vandals to Mauretania, but, once they had crossed the straits, they rejected any control and marched on Carthage.\n\nIn 533 AD, the Byzantine general Belisarius reconquered the former Diocese of Africa from the Vandals on behalf of the Emperor Justinian I. All the territory west of Caesarea had already been lost by the Vandals to the Berber \"Mauri\", but a re-established \"Dux Mauretaniae\" kept a military unit at Septem (modern Ceuta). This was the last Byzantine outpost in Mauretania Tingitana; the rest of what had been the Roman province was united with the Byzantine part of Andalusia under the name of the Praetorian prefecture of Africa, with Septem as administrative capital.\n\nMost of the Maghreb littoral was later organised as the civilian Exarchate of Africa, a special status in view of the outpost defense needs.\n\nWhen the Umayyad Caliphate conquered all of Northern Africa, it brought Islam to the local adherents of the traditional Berber religion and Christianity. The two Mauretania provinces were consolidated as the territory of \"al-Maghrib\" (Arabic for 'the West', and still the official name of the Sharifian Kingdom of Morocco). This larger province also included over half of modern Algeria.\n\nStone ruins dating from the Roman era exist at various archaeological sites, including the Capitoline Temple at Volubilis, the palace of Gordius, Sala Colonia, Tingis and Iulia Constantia Zilil.\n\n\n\n"}

Aminet was originally hosted by several universities' FTP sites, and is now available on CD-ROM and on the web. According to Aminet, as of 1 April 2013, it has 80592 packages online.\n\nIn January 1992, Swiss student Urban Müller took over a software archive that had been started by other members of a computer science students' club. Soon the archive became mirrored worldwide and in 1995 started being distributed on monthly CD-ROMs. By using a single master site (then wuarchive.wustl.edu) for creating ftp scripts for each slave site, Aminet reduced to a bare minimum the effort to set up new mirror sites. Aminet also illustrates practical use of metadata schema by software repositories. Reports of daily additions to this software archive were posted automatically to Usenet (de.comp.sys.amiga.archive), or could be requested as an email newsletter. Most of the programs on Aminet were public domain or shareware, but software companies made updates and demo versions of their programs available as well. Now Aminet is complemented by platform specific sites archiving software for AmigaOS 4, AROS or MorphOS only.\n\nAminet was an early attempt to create a centralized public archive maintained by the users themselves, predated only by the Info-Mac archive. Aminet aimed to keep the community united and free to download new open source software, new program demo releases, patches and localization of Amiga programs (AmigaOS and its modern programs are free to be localized by any single user into any country language), pictures, audio and video files and even hints or complete solutions to various Amiga games.\n\nRecognized among interesting FTP sites in early 1990s, Aminet was the largest public archive of software for any platform until around 1996. When the Internet explosion took place from 1996 to 1999, Aminet rapidly fell behind the emerging massive PC archives.\n\nDuring 2004 the main Aminet mirror suffered from a hard-disk crash and many people considered the whole project dead. Around the same time, Nicolas Mendoza was setting up a modernized interface that indexed Aminet and provided advanced search features and a modern interface to navigate the tree, called Amirepo. He also posted public suggestions on how to help improving Aminet by adding tags for architectures to help catalog the tree that now consisted of MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Amithlon files, in addition to the already existing M68K, PowerUP and WarpOS files. He also suggested on measures to add proper dependencies to complement and replace the existing Requires field. This also in a future goal of letting Aminet function as a repository for package management systems similar to Debian's APT/DPKG and Red Hats' RPM. He tried to contact individuals like Matthias Scheler and Urban Müller which was known to maintain Aminet, but to no avail.\n\nAt the end of 2004 Christoph Gutjahr made contact with Urban Müller and set up a team to continue the Aminet effort. Urban Müller provided a new main mirror site and the backlog of packages were added in. The Amirepo interface of Nicolas Mendoza was integrated and Aminet was officially up and running again in February 2005. During 2005 the uploads started getting going again and in November 2005 most of the ambiguous files and .readme files were sorted out, finally sanitizing the repository. The team has been making lots of changes gradually.\n\n"}

Traditional body on frame SUVs, most 40 series Land Cruisers were built as 2-door models with slightly larger dimensions than the similar Jeep CJ.\n\nThe model was available in short (J40/41/42), medium (J43/44/46) and long (J45/47) wheelbase versions, with petrol and diesel engines.\n\nFor the history of the J series from the original 1951 Toyota Jeep BJ through the J20 series see Land Cruiser History from 1950 to 1955.\n\n\n\nThe J40 series was produced with both diesel and petrol engines. The F series was a 6-cylinder petrol motor, B series a 4-cylinder diesel, and H series a 6-cylinder diesel. The diesel trucks were never sold to the general public in the United States, though some found their way in as mine trucks. Some engines are similar within their series; for example, the F and 2F engines share many of the same parts. However the H and 2H designations have almost nothing in common. \n\nEngines included (power and torque figures may vary depending on the market):\n\n\nToyota still offers many replacement parts for the J40, available through Toyota parts departments worldwide. Its essence lives on in the J70 series, which is essentially a J40 with an updated front half and slightly different engine offerings. It sells in many countries, but was never available in the United States.\n\nFor 2006, Toyota introduced the FJ Cruiser, a modern SUV with trendy contemporary styling. The FJ Cruiser (FJC) went on sale in the spring of 2006.\n\nIn Brazil, the J40 was known as the Toyota Bandeirante, and made from 1968 until 2001. Those built from 1958 to 1962 received the series code FJ25 (topless) and FJ25L (soft top) but are often referred to as FJ-251, and in 1961 thanks to a new motor called 2F - not to be confounded with the later 2F engine from 1975 - there still came out some few units with the series code FJ-151L (soft top). Bandeirantes built from 1968 to 1993 - with Mercedes-Benz engines - received OJ40/45 (OJ50/55 from 1973) series chassis codes and those built from 1994 to 2001 - with Toyota engines - have BJ50/55 series model codes.\n\nEven though its production ended in Brazil many years ago, the Toyota Bandeirante is still very sought after, due to its good off-road performance. Thus Bandeirantes reach high prices in the Brazilian used car market, especially the rare 1993 models which were the only ones fitted with a Mercedes-Benz engine married to a five-speed transmission.\n"}

The regiment's main duty was to train conscripts and the personnel of the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Frontier Guard.\n\n\nThe original predecessor of Häme Regiment was founded in 1626 by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden.\n\nThe Regiment was an administrative unit without significant combat capability. Technically, was is considered to be a cavalry unit, but it did not have light armored unit role of modern-day Western cavalry units. Instead, the regiment was specialized as a logistics training center which trained the bulk of the logistics personnel of Finnish Defence Forces.\n\nThe Häme Cavalry Battalion was the only unit of the Regiment accepting usual, non-volunteer conscripts. Twice a year, the Battalion inducted some 260 conscripts, who were subsequently trained as military drivers, logistics technicians, cooks or military policemen.\n\nThe Headquarters Troop also trained almost all medics of the Finnish Defence Forces on its three-week combat medic course. The NCO school of the unit, on the other hand, received conscript NCO students from all units of the FDF and the Finnish Border Guard for special training as logistics NCOs. The NCO students were trained to fulfill NCO duties as medic NCOs, motor vehicle NCO, supply NCOs, weapons smith NCOs or hygienics NCOs.\n\nThe Häme Cavalry Battalion was the main military unit of the Häme Regiment. It provided infantry training for the conscripts. Before the creation of the regiment in 1986, the battalion was its own independent unit. Tradition march of the battalion was March of Finnish cavalry in 30-years war. The battalion was disbanded in 2014.\n\nThe Military Music School is open to eligible volunteers. Military Music School accepts yearly some 80 applicants adept at playing a musical instrument, on the basis of national entrance exam. The service term is 9 or 12 months. Most of this time is spent in the Finnish Defence Forces Conscript Band. However, part of the conscripts receive NCO training in addition to their musical duties. In addition to conscript training, the Military Music School trains career musicians of the FDF. In 2015, Conscript Band of the Finnish Defence Forces was moved to Armored Brigade which had its own band (Armored Band) disbanded in 2013. Military Music School as organization was disbanded. Conscript Band's and Military Music School's tradition march was \"Marssi nro. 9\".\n\nThe conscript training in Sports School is open to eligible volunteers. For service in Sports School, the conscript must be at least a semi-professional sportsman of national level. The conscripts of the unit are always trained for reconnaissance duties, interfering as little as possible with the sportsman's career. The typical service term is 12 months, most conscripts receiving at least NCO training. In addition to the conscript training, the Sports School educates the career reconnaissance officers and NCOs and FDF physical education personnel. Sports School's tradition march is \"Urheilun Juhlaa\". Sports School was moved to Guard Jaeger Regiment in Helsinki, in addition winter sports' professionals will be trained in Kainuu Brigade.\n\nThe Logistics Training Center is a purely professional unit, centering on training FDF and Border Guard logistics personnel. In addition to its training mission, the Center pursues research and development initiatives of the FDF logistics branch. The personnel of the Center participate actively in the specialist conscript training of the Häme Cavalry Battalion. Logistics Training Center's tradition march was \"Vapaa kansa\". Logistics Training Center was attached to newly formed Logistics centre in Riihimäki.\n\n"}
{"id": "1834967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834967", "title": "Hampton School", "text": "Hampton School\n\nHampton School (formerly Hampton Grammar School) is an independent boys' day school in Hampton, Greater London, England.\n\nIn 1557, Robert Hammond, a wealthy brewer who had acquired property in Hampton, left in his will provision for the maintenance of a \"free scole\" and to build a small schoolhouse \"with seates in yt\" in the churchyard of Hampton Church .\n\nAlthough Hampton School was founded in 1557, there was provision in the will that the school would only continue as long as the vicar, churchwardens and parishioners carried out his requests. If not, then the properties would revert to his heirs. It seems that the school did not survive beyond 1568, or possibly earlier, and the properties reverted to the heirs.\n\nSubsequently, however, the school re-opened in 1612. This was as a result of a Commission established to enquire into the fate of Tudor charities that had disappeared for various reasons. The \"learned counsell on bothe sides\" reached deadlock at the Commissioners. However, in the spirit of compromise and through the generosity of the then legal owner of the properties, Nicholas Pigeon, the school was re-endowed.\n\nThe early school was on the site of St Mary's Church by the River Thames. It moved to a site on Upper Sunbury Road in 1880. The new school buildings cost £8,000 and were built in the Elizabethan Tudor style to accommodate 125 day boys and 25 boarders. The school moved to its present site on Hanworth Road in 1939. The new 28 acre site allowed for expansion and the potential to provide for 600-650 boys. The foundation stone was laid on 5 July 1938 and a year later the school was opened. \n\nThe School converted from voluntary aided status to become a fee-paying independent school in 1975 after changes to the administration of secondary education in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is next to The Lady Eleanor Holles School for girls, with which it co-operates in a number of co-curricular activities and shares several classes, clubs, facilities and a coach service. Headmaster Barry Martin retired in July 2013 after 16 years of service. He was succeeded by Kevin Knibbs.\n\nFounders' Day is celebrated by the school towards the end of each academic year. The occasion is marked by a procession of boys walking from the school to St. Mary's Church for a service including the school choir singing and readings.\n\nThe School buildings include an assembly hall, sports hall, performing arts centre, classrooms, a Sixth Form centre and specialist facilities for the Sciences, Technology, ICT, Art, Music, Drama and Modern Languages. The site of 29 acres (120,000 m2) accommodates playing fields comprising four rugby pitches, seven football pitches, six cricket squares, three astroturf and three acrylic tennis courts, a 3G Astroturf multi-purpose football/rugby pitch, athletics facilities, two rock walls and the Old Hamptonians' Pavilion.\nThe school also owns a boathouse on the Thames, the Millennium Boathouse, to accommodate for rowing practice. The boathouse is shared with the neighbouring Lady Eleanor Holles School.\n\nRecent/ongoing construction\n\nHampton now has a sixth form centre, aside the main hall, within the original building, in place of the old Hammond Quad, and to keep the founders name alive, resulted in the renaming of the 450 Hall to ‘The Hammond Theatre’. The new sixth form centre has two floors, individual study areas, multiple new classrooms and a live wall.\n\nIn addition to this, new classrooms and science laboratories are being built at the rear of the school, joining the Alexandria building to the physics, chemistry and biology departments on the opposite side. The build has been completed and opened during the 2019–2020 academic year.\n\nThrough the Form Charity programme the whole school community helps raise money and awareness for good causes locally (e.g.Princess Alice Hospice, Barnardos, Home-Start and the Shooting Star Trust), nationally (e.g. Jeans for Genes Day and Breakthrough Breast Cancer), and internationally (e.g. Opportunity International, the African Medical and Research Foundation, Pahamune House). In 2012/13, over £25,000 was raised by Form Charity. The programme involves a vote (from a shortlist) by students as to which charities the school will be supporting the following year. The money from events in that year then goes to the four chosen charities.\n\nA Level Results for 2012-2013 : 31% of the mainstream grades were A*s (2012: 30%), 74.23% were at A*-A (2012: 74%) and 94.6% were at A*-B (2012: 96%). Thirty boys sat the Pre-U Exam in Physics, 18 of whom were graded D2, the equivalent of an A*, and 10 of whom received the even higher D1 rating. Nearly all leavers secured places at an elite university and thirty one Oxbridge offers were confirmed.\nThe School's results are significantly above the national figures and almost all Fifth Formers stay on in the Sixth Form. \nThese are results for GCSE in 2012-13: 89.64% of the grades were A*s and As (2012: 91%), while the percentage of A* grades was 57.29% (2012: 56%). The national figure for A* grades for boys in 2013 was 5.3%. One boy achieved 11 A* grades, twenty achieved 10 and 14 achieved 9. A* grades accounted for over 57% of all grades awarded. There was a 99.89% A*-C grade pass rate. In Mathematics, Geography, History, English Language, English Literature, Modern Languages, Physics and Biology boys follow the more rigorous IGCSE courses. As well as GCSEs and IGCSEs, 94 boys sat the OCR Free Standing Mathematics Qualification. There is no A* grade for this qualification, but 85 boys received A grades.\n\nHampton School has for some years financed a link with Kiira College Butiki, a secondary school in Uganda. As well as regularly supporting international organisations as part of its general charity programme, it supports a safe haven for children at Senga Bay in Malawi. Hampton boys have regularly spent some of their gap years at either Kiira College or the Safe Haven.\n\nFormer pupils include England Rugby sevens captain Simon Amor, Bath and England 'A' player Andy Beattie.. In the 2012–2013 season, the 1st XV reached the semi-final of the Daily Mail Cup, the furthest it has ever progressed, but narrowly lost 11–5 to Dulwich College. It also won the Jack Chester Memorial Cup. It was named Evening Standard Team of the Month in December 2012 and Rugby World Team of the Month in April 2013. In 2014 and 2015, the Hampton 1st XV reached the quarter-finals of the Natwest Cup, only to lose out to RGS High Wycombe and Dulwich College respectively. The school has close links with Premiership Academies such as London Irish, Harlequins and London Wasps, as well as four current pupils having played at England U16 schoolboy level.\n\nThe school regularly takes part in national competitions, winning the Boodles ISFA Cup in 1999, 2007 and 2012 and reaching the final in 2005, 2009 and 2015. The U15 Team won the Investec ISFA Cup in 2012 and 2015, played at the Burton Albion FC stadium, and also the ISFA Fair Play Award ISFA Cup in 2012. In 2019, the U18 team won the English Schools' Football Association Cup, a competition in which almost every school with an U18 football team in England competes in. 364 teams, including the Hampton team, entered that year.\n\nThe 1st XI frequently tours overseas countries such as Sri Lanka and India. In England, the 1st XI has regularly won the 50/40 League cup, a competition played amongst schools in London and surrounding areas, as well as having reached the final stages of the National Twenty20 competition. Age group teams have consistently won the Middlesex Cup and competed in later rounds of the Nationals. Leavers have gone on to play first-class cricket and two currently play at first-class counties: Toby Roland-Jones (Middlesex) and Zafar Ansari (Surrey). The school is also represented by the Old Hamptonians in the Cricketers' Cup/Trophy, an old boys' competition played by leavers of the top cricketing schools in the country in a knockout format.\n\nHampton School Boat Club is one of the top school rowing clubs in the country and each year produces a 1st VIII that competes at Championship level in national school events. The boat club is based at the Millennium Boathouse which it shares with the Lady Eleanor Holles School. Rowing at Hampton is open to boys in the third year (Year 9) and above and the boat club competes at many races both at home and abroad. Hampton has produced three treble winning 1st VIIIs in its history and has been strongly represented at the World Rowing Junior Championships. Martin Cross, a history teacher there, is a gold medalist from the 1984 Olympics and won bronze in 1980. Many Old Hamptonians have gone on to compete at higher levels such as The Boat Race, the World Rowing Championships and the Olympic Games, with Greg Searle and Jonny Searle perhaps the most famous of those, winning gold in the coxed pair in Barcelona in 1992.\nIn 2004 Hampton won 1st, 2nd and 3rd VIIIs at the Schools' Head of the River Race. In 2013, at the same race, they came first in the following categories; Championship VIII's, 2nd VIII's, 3rd VIII's, J16 Championship VIII's, J16 2nd VIII's, J15 2nd VIII's, and J15 3rd VIII's, winning a total of 63 gold medals.In 2012–13, Hampton was the top-performing school in both the School's Head of the River Race and the National Schools’ Rowing Regatta, where all of the senior squad rowers won medals.\n\nIn addition to class music, nearly 400 boys receive instrumental tuition from visiting teachers. Guitarist Brian May of rock band Queen was a pupil at the school, as were bass player Paul Samwell-Smith and drummer Jim McCarty, later of The Yardbirds and guitarist and pianist Vic Briggs, later of Eric Burdon & The Animals. One pipe organ pupil at the school, Timothy Burke of The Mules, served as Organ Scholar at Exeter College, Oxford from 2001–2004. More recently, Lawrence Thain FRCO became Organ Scholar of New College, Oxford in 2008. There is a full Symphony Orchestra, as well as a String Orchestra, a Chamber Orchestra, Wind Band and two Jazz Bands. There are about thirty different music groups playing regularly. Frequent concerts provide performing opportunities for these groups, and for soloists and chamber groups.\n\nDramatic productions also range widely: a typical year might see a Shakespearean or classical play, many studio presentations including pupils' own work, a musical, and evenings of junior drama, with each Form in an entire year group putting on a play, or a whole year group involved in a major production, an excellent example being the \"450th Musical,\" a work designed to commemorate the schools 450th anniversary, which involved contributions from every year of the school, and was devised entirely by the 5th and 6th Forms.\n\nA Hampton School Theatre Company, \"In Human Form\", took its own play The London Thing, to the Edinburgh Festival in August 2000, and returned there in August 2001 with their play Lucky. A newly formed Theatre Company, \"About Turn\", took its first production to the Edinburgh Festival in August 2002 and returned in 2004.\n\nIn 2008, the school (in association with Lady Eleanor Holles) performed Stephen Sondheim's \"\". The staging was highly elaborate, including props (such as chairs and razors) from original productions at the National Theatre. In August 2009 the group, as Artfelt Theatre Company, took this production (albeit in shortened, reduced orchestration form) to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nHampton School hosted its very first annual Playwrights Festival in March 2014. This event consisted of the plays \"Luther and Severus\" (Aca Delic and Oliver Cook), \"All There Is\" (Thomas Millward), and \"The Forecast\" (Fergus Church). All three were written and directed by 5th and 6th formers, and performed by 4th to 6th formers from both LEH and Hampton. The event was organised by Lauren Bensted, and were performed in the 450 Hall or Drama Hall.\n\nBoys from Hampton School have also a long history of being heavily involved in the production of the newspaper of the National Student Drama Festival (Noises Off). Current alumni on the staff there are John Winterburn (Office Manager), Henry Ellis, Euan Forsyth and Ben Lander.\n\nThe Hammond Theatre, which opened in 2015 which was officially launched by TV and film actor, John Hannah.\n\nA range of topics is addressed and boys of all ages are encouraged to participate, either as a main speaker or from the floor. Debates are held with the Lady Eleanor Holles School and teams are entered in national events, notably the Schools' Mace and the Oxford Union competition.\n\nThe School Magazine, The Lion, which is distributed free and is produced by an editorial team of pupils, led by a teacher. It is produced at the School on its own desktop publishing equipment and supplied for printing on disc. This magazine includes boys' creative and original writing.

{"id": "1834972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834972", "title": "Giuseppina Strepponi", "text": "Giuseppina Strepponi\n\nClelia Maria Josepha (Giuseppina) Strepponi (8 September 1815 – 14 November 1897) was a nineteenth-century Italian operatic soprano of great renown and the second wife of composer Giuseppe Verdi.\n\nShe is often credited with having contributed to Verdi's first successes, starring in a number of his early operas, including the role of Abigaille in the world premiere of \"Nabucco\" in 1842. A highly gifted singer, Strepponi excelled in the bel canto repertoire and spent much of her career portraying roles in operas by Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Gioachino Rossini, often sharing the stage with tenor and baritone Giorgio Ronconi. Donizetti wrote the title role of his opera \"Adelia\" specifically for Strepponi. She was described as possessing a \"limpid, penetrating, smooth voice, seemly action, a lovely figure; and to Nature's liberal endowments she adds an excellent technique\"; her \"deep inner feeling\" was also lauded.\n\nBoth her personal and professional life was complicated by overwork, by at least three known pregnancies, and by her vocal deterioration which caused her to retire from the stage by the age of 31, in 1846 when she moved to Paris to become a singing teacher. While it is known that she had a professional relationship with Verdi from the time of his first opera, \"Oberto\" in 1839, they became a couple by 1847 when they lived together in Paris, then moved to Busetto in 1849, married in 1859, and remained together until the end of her life.\n\nStrepponi was born in the city of Lodi in the Lombard region of Italy. She was the oldest child of Rosa Cornalba and Feliciano Strepponi (1797–1832), who was the organist at Monza Cathedral and a moderately successful opera composer, his works having been performed in theatres in Milan, Turin and Trieste. Her first lessons in music were with her father who focused mainly on teaching her to play the piano, but in 1830 she was enrolled in the Milan Conservatory although just over the age of 15. After her father's death at the age of 35 in 1832 of encephalitis, she was able to continue studying singing and the piano as a non-paying pupil at the Conservatory where she notably won first prize for bel canto during her final year in 1834. Her performance of the cavatina from \"Beatrice di Tenda\" and for her parts in both a duet and a trio brought mention in the \"Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano\" of 29 September 1834, where it was noted that her vocal qualities, \"will be a fine acquisition, when the time comes, for the Italian stage\".\n\nStrepponi made her professional opera début in December 1834 as Adria in Luigi Ricci's \"Chiara di Rosembergh\" at the Teatro Orfeo. She had her first major success during the following spring at the Theatro Grande in Trieste singing the title role in Rossini's \"Matilde di Shabran\".\n\nThis success quickly led to numerous engagements at major opera houses throughout Italy and Giuseppina soon became her family's major bread winner. In the summer of 1835, she went to Austria to sing Adalgisa in Bellini's \"Norma\" and Amina in Bellini's \"La sonnambula\" at the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna where she was praised highly by audiences and critics. Although she was highly talented, she never sang outside Italy after 1835.\n\nStrepponi became a celebrity among opera singers during the late 1830s, arousing fanatical enthusiasm in performances throughout Italy. In 1836 she sang the roles of Ninetta in Rossini's \"La gazza ladra\", Elvira in Bellini's \"I puritani\", and the title role in Rossini's \"La Cenerentola\" at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice. \n\nIn Spring 1837, she went under contract with Alessandro Lanari of Florence, then known as \"the king of impresarios\", who was able to secure important engagements for her in the years following. However, within a very short time, she found herself pregnant and had to sing through three pregnancies during the time with Lanari.\n\nThat same year she reprised the role of Elvira and portrayed the roles of Elena in Donizetti's \"Marino Faliero\" and the title role in Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. In 1838 she sang the title roles in Donizetti's \"Maria di Rudenz\", Bellini's \"Beatrice di Tenda\", and Carlo Coccia's \"Caterina di Guisa\" at the Imperial Regio Teatro degli Avvalorati in Livorno. She made her La Scala debut in 1839, replacing Antonietta Marini-Rainieri, who was found unsuitable in the work's premiere performance, as Leonora in the first production of Giuseppe Verdi's first opera \"Oberto\". Strepponi's performance was considered one of the strongest aspects of this production and one of the main reasons that the work was received well.\n\nOther notable roles for Strepponi during the late 1830s include Elaisa in Saverio Mercadante's \"Il giuramento\", Adina in Donizetti's \"L'elisir d'amore\" and Sandrina in Luigi Ricci's \"Un'avventura di Scaramuccia\". However, the record of constant performances over several years has invited speculation about what that might have done to the quality of her voice in later years.\n\nReturning to Milan for rehearsals of \"Nabucco\", she claimed that illness would prevent future performances in Vienna and asked to be relieved of that obligation. Lanari ordered a complete medical examination which concluded that she had \"reached the limits of her endurance\" and that she would be obliged to give up her career or else she would become a consumptive. She persisted with \"Nabucco\", singing all eight performances of Verdi's opera: in her words to Lanari, \"I dragged myself to the end of the performances\" and then told him that she had the possibility of an offer of marriage from a man who would only do so if she were free from contractual obligations. The doctors' conclusions would allow her to do that, but it took her more than a year to recover.\n\nStrepponi continued to remain a highly popular singer during the early 1840s. She notably sang the title role in Donizetti's \"Adelia\" in 1841 at the Teatro Apollo in Rome, a role written specifically for her by the composer. This was followed by a critically acclaimed portrayal as Abigaille in the world premiere of Verdi's \"Nabucco\" at La Scala in 1842. She reprised the role of Abigaille in several opera houses throughout Italy the following year, including the Teatro Regio di Parma and the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, which considerably aided the work's popularity. Also in 1843, she sang the roles of Elisabetta in Donizetti's \"Roberto Devereux\" and Imogene in Bellini's \"Il pirata\" in Bologna.\n\nOther notable roles for Strepponi during the early 1840s included the title role in Bellini's \"Norma\", the Marchesa del Poggio in Verdi's \"Un giorno di regno\", and the title role in Giovanni Pacini's \"Saffo\".\n\nAround 1844, Strepponi began to experience significant vocal problems, most likely brought on by her relentless performing schedule, which culminated in a disastrous season in Palermo in 1845, where she was booed by audiences. Her voice never recovered and she thereafter appeared only sporadically in operas until her retirement in February 1846. Most of her last performances were in operas by Verdi, including performances of Elvira in \"Ernani\" and Lucrezia Contarini in \"I due Foscari\".\n\nCamillo Cirelli (whom Verdi had met while a student of Lavigna's some years before) was one of a group of three theatrical agents under Lanari who took responsibility for Strepponi from Milan after the early months of 1837. He also engaged her for the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice, but it was not uncommon for her to work under other impresarios. However, she became pregnant around March/April 1837 and she stopped singing only about a month before her first child, Camillo Luifi Antonio was born in Turin in January 1838 and baptised as \"Sterponi\" \"(sic)\". From her performance records of these two years, Frank Walker corroborates the fact that she was absent from the stage for about three months, and then began another hectic round of performances under an exclusive contract with Lanari announced in February 1838. Cirelli believed that he was the father, although Frank Walker states that he proved to be a very good friend and that \"it is possible that he had been Camillino's godfather, and given him his Christian name\".\n\nHowever, sometime in the Spring of 1838, Strepponi became pregnant again and, in Florence on 9 February 1839, she gave birth to her second child, Giuseppina Fausta, only a few hours after completing a performance at the Teatro Alfieri and before leaving for an engagement in Venice. The child was placed in the turnstile for abandoned infants at the Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence under the name of \"Sinforosa Cirelli\". These children were known as the \"esposti\", \"the exposed\", or as described by Phillips-Matz, \"society's trash\". Cirelli, who had returned to Milan, initially denied paternity, believing that she had taken another lover. But Cirelli then accepted paternity when the child was born prematurely and there was no time for her to be taken to somewhere private for the birth. \n\nIn late 1838, Lanari and Bartolomeo Merelli, the impresario of La Scala, had negotiated for Strepponi, Moriani, and Ronconi to appear in La Scala for the following spring season, but they had both been horrified to find out in early January that she was five months pregnant, and that this would cause her to be unavailable. But in February 1839 in Florence, she sang in \"Il giuramento\" with such dramatic intensity that it appears to have caused her to miscarry and, by necessity, withdraw from further performances for some time. Increasingly pressured by Lanari, she finally relented to appear at La Fenice, where she was a triumph in March. By April 1839 she was in Milan to fulfill those engagements, and her La Scala debut in \"I Puritani\" on 20th was another triumph. By March 1840, it appears that she may have given birth to a stillborn girl since Phillips-Matz notes that a combination of time taken out of her working schedule corresponds to around the 22 March records showing parents abandoning her in the parish in which she lived.\n\nPerformances in Florence in March and early April 1841 in \"I Puritani\" were the last which Strepponi gave with both Ronconi and Moriani, the latter then leaving for Vienna and Dresden, she and Ronconi going on to the other Italian towns. Later in the year, as the 1841–42 season was being planned, Walker states that \"she knew quite well that she would not be able to carry out the whole of this programme, for she was again pregnant.\" During the following few months, letters between Strepponi and Lanari, in whom she had clearly confided, reveal the existence of \"the despicable M ...\" (and in another letter, he is \"Mr. Mo..\"), and she asks that he \"kindly remind him of the \"important\" sum of money that through your offices he has agreed to pay.\" On 16 August she writes again to Lanari, stating that \"I have been too cruelly treated under the mantle of love ... But I do not wish him ill\"\n\nAll of Frank Walker's investigations, using letters and performance histories of the different people involved in her life, put Strepponi together with only one man at the time that the three children must have been conceived. He concludes that it is the only man who must have been the father of the first two children, and who was then the prospective father of the third: it is Napoleone Moriani. Giuseppina had given birth to a girl in Trieste on 4 November 1841, Adelina Rosa Maria Carolina Strepponi. It appears that she then left the baby with a couple, the Vianellos, who took in illegitimate children. However, the child died of dysentery on 4 October 1842. Strepponi left for Venice with Cirelli with whom she had been living in Milan as a common law wife.\n\nAn early 20th century biography of Verdi, as well as one written in 1938 about Strepponi's life by Mercede Mandula, both propose that Strepponi became Merelli's lover in the early 1840s and it is claimed that this relationship resulted in another illegitimate child. However, this account is vehemently disputed by both Frank Walker, who declares \"but it is not true: it is fiction\", as well as biographer Gabriele Baldini, who states \"that it \"is\" certain that Giuseppina was not Merelli's lover, that she had no sons by him ...\". Verdi's biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, in her account of Strepponi's life both before and after becoming Verdi's partner and then his wife, lays out in detail the singer's history up to the time of \"Nabucco\" and her investigations have produced no evidence of the accuracy of the early scenario.\n\nIn October 1846 Strepponi moved to Paris and became a singing teacher. She came out of her stage retirement briefly for one last opera appearance at the Comédie-Italienne which was not well received. Verdi, who was in England for the premiere of his opera \"I masnadieri\" in July 1847, returned via Paris and the two began a romantic relationship, with the composer remaining there for two years (albeit with short periods in Italy to firstly return to Milan in April 1848 after the nationalistic uprising there and then to oversee a production of his new opera in Rome, \"La battaglia di Legnano\" in early 1849.\n\nThe couple returned to Italy by July 1849 and began , Verdi's hometown where they first lived at the Palazzo Orlandi. The reaction of many of the people of Busseto towards Giuseppina, a woman of the theatre living openly with the composer in an unmarried state concerned Verdi, and as such, she was shunned in the town and at church. While Verdi could \"treat the Bussetani with contempt ... Giuseppina, in the next few years, suffered greatly.\"\n\nFrom May 1851 just outside the town, which today is known as the Villa Verdi.\n\nAlthough unmarried until 1859, the couple remained together for the rest of their lives and she supported her husband in his career in many ways, her knowledge of French and English being especially useful. It is even thought that it was she who translated the original play by Antonio García Gutiérrez, \"El trovador\" of 1836, which became \"Il trovatore\" in 1853. Julian Budden notes that a letter from her to Verdi two weeks before the premiere urges him to \"hurry up and give OUR [her caps] \"Trovatore\"\".\n\nIn other respects, she offered him much advice and, as Walker recalls from her account of being curled up in an armchair nearby, all the while offering comments and criticism while Verdi was composing, he speculates that \"she must have sung many of these world-famous melodies for the first time from the manuscript sketches.\" At one point he took her advice not to have to compose on order by a certain date, but to find a suitable subject, then compose the music at his own convenience, and then find a suitable venue and suitable singers, and he so informed Corticelli, the theatrical agent from Bologna.\n\nTheir marriage was happy and Verdi was deeply saddened by her death at Sant'Agata in 1897.\n\nIn 1894, Verdi and his wife made their last trip to Paris. Hungarian writer Dezső Szomori, who knew them at that time, then described Verdi as a man with small eyes and next to him a woman, Giuseppina, who looked more like an old bird, but ultimately concluded: \"a beautiful and charming couple who grew up together and grow old in the music world.\"\n\nIn those years, Strepponi frequently suffered from stomach problems and arthritis and during her last year of life she could barely move from her bed. In the autumn of 1897, when the couple was once again preparing to spend the winter in Genoa in a more salubrious climate with proximity to the sea, Verdi made the decision to stay in Sant'Agata because his wife was bedridden. Giuseppina Strepponi died after a long illness on 14 November that year at Sant'Agata, due to pneumonia. She was initially buried in Milan. With the death of Giuseppina, Verdi became a widower for the second time, and was once again tormented by the pain of losing one of the most important figures in his life. When Verdi died in 1901 he left instructions in his will to be buried next to Giuseppina, but he was buried in the main cemetery of Milan. The desire to see the couple together in the afterlife eventually led on 26 February 1901 to the transfer of both of their bodies to the oratory of the Casa di Riposo in Milan, the retirement home for musicians which Verdi had created. Arturo Toscanini directed a choir of 900 singers in the famous \"Va, pensiero\" from \"Nabucco\".\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

He retired in 1967, after a season with Torino. Internationally, he played for the Italian national team, earning 14 caps and participating in the 1962 World Cup. He served as team captain for both Milan and Italy.\n\nAs a manager, he also coached his former club Milan on two occasions, as well as Italian sides Foggia, Ternana and Parma. He had a successful career in charge of the Italy under-21 side, winning the European Under-21 Championship a record three consecutive times; he later also coached the Italy senior team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and the Paraguay national football team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe son of Albino Maldini, a sailor, and Maria, Cesare Maldini was born in Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. His father's roots were from Padova, however, as a great lineage of Maldini's originated from there. Cesare Maldini never referenced any origins other than his Italian ones. He married Maria Luisa (Marisa; née Mazzucchelli, 1939–2016) in 1962; together they had six children: three sons and three daughters. One of his sons, Paolo, also had a successful football career as a defender with Milan, and also once held the record for the most caps for the Italian national team (now third behind Gianluigi Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro). The younger Maldini captained Milan to the UEFA Champions League title in 2003 and 2007, and won the trophy five times in total. Maldini's grandsons Christian and Daniel played football in the Milan youth teams.\n\nMaldini began his playing career with local side Triestina, in 1952, and made his Serie A debut in his first season with the club, on 24 May 1953, in a 0–0 away draw against Palermo. After two seasons with Triestina, Maldini transferred to A.C. Milan in 1954, where he went on to achieve notable successes both domestically and internationally in the team's starting line-up, also becoming an important figure at the club. He made his debut with the club on 19 September 1954, in a 4–0 league win over his former side, featuring in a Milan team which included several important players at the time, such as Lorenzo Buffon, Francesco Zagatti, Nils Liedholm, Gunnar Nordahl, and Juan Alberto Schiaffino; he immediately broke into the first team and won his first league title in his debut season with the squad. In total, he made 347 appearances for Milan in Serie A, scoring 3 goals, and made 412 appearances for the club in all competitions. Maldini won four league titles with Milan, and also later became the team's captain in 1961, a role which he held for several years, until he left the club, and was succeeded by Gianni Rivera. During his time with Milan, he also won a Coppa Latina, and went on to capture the club's first ever European Cup as team captain in 1963, as Milan defeated Benfica 2–1 at Wembley Stadium on 22 May, with two goals from José Altafini; as a result, Milan became the first Italian side ever to win the trophy, while Maldini became the first Italian captain to lift the cup. He made his final appearance for Milan on 22 May 1966, in a 6–1 home win over Catania, in Serie A. In 1966 he moved to Torino for a season, before retiring in 1967; he made his final Serie A appearance on 28 May, in a 2–1 away defeat to Napoli.\n\nAt international level Maldini earned 14 caps for the Italy national football team between 1960 and 1963, also serving as the national team's captain between 1962 and 1963, but was less successful than with Milan. He made his debut on 6 January 1960, in a 3–0 win over Switzerland in the 1955–60 Central European International Cup, and later took part in the 1962 FIFA World Cup with Italy, making two appearances in the competition. The team suffered a disappointing and controversial first-round elimination, although he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances. He made his final appearance for Italy in a European championship qualifier in Moscow, in 1963, as Italy suffered a 2–0 away defeat to the Soviet Union.\n\nA commanding, elegant, and respected defender, with good physical attributes, excellent technique, passing range, and an ability to set the tempo of his team's play, Maldini was known for being strong in the air, and for his outstanding ability to read the game, time his challenges, and anticipate opponents; he is considered one of the greatest defenders of his generation, and one of Italy's best ever defenders. He was also highly regarded for his leadership, and consistency, as well as his discipline and class, both on and off the pitch; throughout his career, he only received five yellow cards and was only sent off only once. A tactically versatile player, although he was usually deployed as a man-marking centre-back (or \"stopper\"), or as a sweeper, he was also capable of functioning as a full-back on either side of the pitch, but was usually fielded on the right flank when played in this position; he was even used as a defensive midfielder on occasion, due to his tendency to advance into midfield when in possession of the ball and start attacking plays from the back. Despite his reputation as a consistently world-class defender, in his early career Maldini was at times also known for being overly confident in possession, and for having a penchant to take risks when carrying or playing the ball out of the defence, due to his passing accuracy and ability on the ball; this tendency occasionally led to sporadic and atypical defensive errors, which were later humorously dubbed \"Maldinate\" by the Italian media.\n\nAfter retiring from playing Maldini became a coach, starting his career as an assistant manager for Nereo Rocco at Milan in 1970, and later also coached the team between 1972 and 1974, while Rocco served as the club's technical director. Maldini's first official match as Milan's head coach came on 6 September 1972, in a 4–1 away win over FA Red Boys Differdange in the Cup Winners' Cup; Maldini won a Coppa Italia and a Cup Winners' Cup double in 1973, and also narrowly missed out on the league title that season. However, Milan also suffered a 6–1 defeat on aggregate to Ajax in the European Super Cup; this was the worst defeat for an Italian team in an UEFA competition final. He was sacked by the club in 1974, following a disappointing 2–1 defeat to Verona on 6 April, and was replaced by Giovanni Trapattoni for the final few games of the season. He later went on to coach Foggia (1974–1976), Ternana (1976–77), and Serie C1 side Parma (1978–80), helping the team to obtain Serie B promotion during his tenure with the club, after managing a second-place finish in the league during the 1978–79 Serie C1 season.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1986, he was one of Enzo Bearzot's assistants for the Italian national team, and even served as his assistant manager during the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, which Italy won.\n\nMaldini took charge of the Italian Under-21 side in 1986, and coached the team for ten years, winning the European Under-21 Football Championship tournament a record three consecutive times between 1992 and 1996. As Italy's Under-21 coach, Maldini was also known as a mentor for many of the team's players, who later stated that he played a key role in their development; indeed, former protégés Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluigi Buffon and Francesco Totti from Maldini's 1996 Under-21 European Championship-winning squad went on to win the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also coached the Italian Olympic teams that took part at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nFollowing his successes with the Under-21 side, Maldini took charge of the senior team in December 1996, replacing Arrigo Sacchi. After taking over as the national team's manager, he helped Italy to a crucial 1–0 away victory over England at Wembley Stadium on 12 February 1997, and successfully aided the team to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup undefeated through the play-offs against Russia. Under Maldini, Italy were one of the four teams who also took part in the 1997 Tournoi de France friendly tournament, against his wishes, in which they finished in last place. Despite initially struggling in qualification, the Italian media and fans had great expectations of the 1998 side, which included a strong defence, and several prolific attacking players, such as Christian Vieri, Alessandro Del Piero and Filippo Inzaghi, among others, in their prime. Cesare Maldini's son, Paolo, was captain of the team.\n\nItaly were drawn in Group B of the tournament with Chile, Cameroon and Austria. They won their group, drawing 2–2 with Chile in their opening game, and then beating Cameroon 3–0 and Austria 2–1. Advancing to the Round of 16, Italy then beat Norway 1–0 to secure a spot in the quarter-finals against tournament hosts France. After a goalless draw, Italy were eventually eliminated by the eventual champions on penalties.\n\nAlthough Italy did not lose a match at the World Cup, Maldini resigned after the tournament due to heavy criticism in the Italian media over his allegedly ultra-defensive and \"old-fashioned\" catenaccio-inspired tactics, which included the use of a traditional man-marking defensive back-line, as well as a sweeper. He was also condemned for leaving Gianfranco Zola out of the squad, and for his reluctance to field creative forwards Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero alongside each other in the front-line, opting instead to have one player come on for the other in the second half; these controversial substitutions were compared to those made between Sandro Mazzola and Gianni Rivera by Ferruccio Valcareggi, the Italian manager at the 1970 World Cup.\n\nAfter serving as a head scout for his former team Milan from February 1999, Maldini briefly returned to coach the Milan first team in March 2001, serving as an interim manager for the club (whose captain was his son, Paolo) alongside youth coach Mauro Tassotti, following Alberto Zaccheroni's sacking, and led the squad for their final games of the season. Although the club endured a disappointing season, finishing in sixth place and failing to qualify for the Champions League, Maldini did lead the team to a memorable 6–0 victory over cross-city rivals Inter in the Milan Derby on 11 May; the result was Inter's worst-ever home defeat in Serie A, and Milan's biggest league win in the Derby. After helping the club to qualify for the UEFA Cup, Maldini was replaced by Fatih Terim the following season, although he initially remained with the club as an advisor to the coach.\n\nIn January 2002, Maldini became coach of Paraguay's national team. His appointment caused some controversy as domestic managers were overlooked (prompting the managers union to try to unsuccessfully expel him for immigration breaches), and because he spoke little Spanish. Maldini nonetheless had the support of star goalkeeper José Luis Chilavert and several other senior players. He took over the team which had already qualified for the 2002 World Cup hosted by South Korea and Japan; at the age of 70, he became, what was at the time, the oldest coach to ever be in charge of a national side at a World Cup tournament (his son Paolo captained Italy in the same tournament); this record was later broken by Greece's coach Otto Rehhagel in the 2010 World Cup.\n\nDespite missing Chilavert for the first game due to suspension, Paraguay managed to advance from Group B to the Round of 16, after a 2–2 draw with South Africa, a 3–1 defeat from Spain, and a 3–1 victory over Slovenia. In the Round of 16, Paraguay were eliminated by the eventual finalists Germany, losing 1–0 courtesy of an 89th-minute goal from Oliver Neuville.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, Maldini was known for his cautious, traditional, and conservative approach as a manager, and he used a solid, defensive-minded \"catenaccio\"-inspired system as the head coach of the Italian national side, a system which had been widely used by his mentor, Nereo Rocco; as he preferred to build his team on a very strong back-line, he often fielded a 4–4–2 formation, but which usually employed a sweeper (or \"libero,\" in Italian) and three man-marking centre-backs (or \"stopper,\" in Italian) in front of the goalkeeper, although at times, he would also use a more common flat four-man defensive line and a zonal marking system, with two centre-backs, a left-back, and a right-back. His teams were often known for being very compact defensively and for their tight and physical marking of opponents and would often play on the counter-attack. In attack, he usually paired two forwards who would complement each other alongside one another, namely a traditionally large, physical, and prolific centre-forward – such as Christian Vieri – with a smaller, faster, creative and more technical second striker – such as Roberto Baggio or Alessandro Del Piero; on rare occasions, he also employed an attacking trident.\n\nAfter the 2002 World Cup, Maldini returned to A.C. Milan as a talent scout for the \"Rossoneri\". He also later worked as a sports analyst for several radio stations and sports channels, such as beIN SPORTS, and also for Al Jazeera in 2012, with Alessandro Altobelli.\n\nOn 3 April 2016, Cesare died in Milan at the age of 84. In his honour, a minute of silence was held before every league game in Italy that weekend, while Milan players wore black armbands in their match against Atalanta. Maldini's funeral service was held on 5 April, at the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, in Milan, and was attended by several important footballing figures, including his son Paolo. His wife died later that year, on 28 July.\n\nSource:\n\"*European competitions include the UEFA European Cup & UEFA Cup Winners' Cup\"\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In particular, it seeks to ensure that the government's employees have sworn and signed an oath; deposited a security, money, property, or bond with or without securities; and are covered by a lawful liability insurance carrier. The party argues that without the above, no agent can lawfully claim to perform the duties with which they have been empowered. It is also concerned that there is a lack of adequate checks and balances where a government employee is cited for civil abuse.\n\nThe party is a single issue party: it does not maintain policies on any other issues.\n\n"}

The designs and workmanship was predominantly the duty of the company's creator, Chris Brady. The firm used native Australian hardwoods, particularly jarrah, sheoak, spotted gum, marri, wandoo and lemon scented gum for the drums they manufactured. The business was based in Armadale, an outer suburb of Perth, Western Australia.\n\nChris Brady introduced the world's first solid wood (hollow tree trunk) modern snare drum, and revolutionised the ply shell and block shell method of construction. He possibly created the world's first 10\", 12\" and 16\" snare drums, and is credited with their popularisation in modern music.\n\nThe company's client list includes over 400 internationally renowned drummers including Will Calhoun, Steve Ferrone, Mick Fleetwood, Chad Smith, Jeff Porcaro (formerly), Larry Mullen, Jr, Tre Cool and Thomas Lang. Though the company manufactures all drums shells, their fame is gained from their snare drums. \n\nIn April 2015, Brady Drum Company ceased production of their instruments, following Chris Brady's ongoing health complications. In November 2015, Brady Drum Company announced the closure of the company via its official website and Facebook page.\n"}

{"id": "1835000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835000", "title": "Digital storytelling", "text": "Digital storytelling\n\nDigital storytelling is a short form of digital media production that allows everyday people to share aspects of their story. The media used may include the digital equivalent of film techniques (full-motion video with sound), stills, audio only, or any of the other forms of non-physical media (material that exists only as electronic files as opposed to actual paintings or photographs on paper, sounds stored on tape or disc, movies stored on film) which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea.\n\n\"Digital storytelling\" is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of everyday people who use digital tools to tell their 'story'. Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats, and can be interactive.\n\nThe term \"digital storytelling\" can also cover a range of digital narratives (web-based stories, interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative computer games); It is sometimes used to refer to film-making in general, and as of late, it has been used to describe advertising and promotion efforts by commercial and non-profit enterprises.\n\nOne can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse peoples share their life stories and creative imaginings with others. This newer form of storytelling emerged with the advent of accessible media production techniques, hardware and software, including but not limited to digital cameras, digital voice recorders, iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Final Cut Express and WeVideo. These new technologies allow individuals to share their stories over the Internet on YouTube, Vimeo, compact discs, podcasts, and other electronic distribution systems.\n\nOne can think of digital storytelling as the modern extension of the ancient art of storytelling, now interwoven with digitized still and moving images and sound. Thanks to new media and digital technologies, individuals can approach storytelling from unique perspectives. Many people use elaborate non-traditional story forms, such as non-linear and interactive narratives.\n\nSimply put, digital stories are multimedia presentations that combine a variety of communicative elements within a narrative structure. Media may include any combination of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (like maps).\n\nDigital stories may be used as an expressive medium within the classroom to integrate subject matter with extant knowledge and skills from across the curriculum. Students can work individually or collaboratively to produce their own digital stories. Once completed, these stories can easily be uploaded to the internet and can be made available to an international audience, depending on the topic and purpose of the project.\n\nThe broad definition has been used by many artists and producers to link what they do with traditions of oral storytelling and often to distinguish their work from slick or commercial projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Digital Storytelling has been used by Ken Burns, in the documentary \"The Civil War,\" cited as one of the first models of this genre. In his documentary, Burns used first-person accounts that served to reveal the heart and emotions of this tragic event in American history, as well as narration, archival images, modern cinematography, and music (Sylvester & Greenidge, 2009). Some of the other artists who have described themselves as digital storytellers are the late Dana Atchley, his collaborator Joe Lambert, Abbe Don, Brenda Laurel, and Pedro Meyer.\n\nThe \"short narrated films\" definition of digital storytelling comes from a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the American Film Institute in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990s into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling).\n\nAt StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling), digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a short film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. Technology enables those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using \"moving\" images and sound. The lower processing and memory requirements for using stills as compared with video, and the ease with which the so-called \"Ken Burns\" pan effect can be produced with online or regular video editing software, have made it easy to create aesthetic but short films.\n\nDigital storytelling was integrated into public broadcasting by the BBC's \"Capture Wales\" project working with organisations such as Breaking Barriers. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England titled \"Telling Lives\". Sveriges Utbildningsradio created \"Rum för Berättande\" (\"Room for Storytelling\"). Netherlands Educational TV Teleac/NOT created a program with young people in different parts of the country. KQED, Rocky Mountain PBS, WETA and other public television stations in the US have developed projects. Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms that are interactive and look better. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences.\n\nThe most important characteristics of a digital story are that it no longer conforms to the traditional conventions of storytelling because it is capable of combining still imagery, moving imagery, sound, and text, as well as being nonlinear and contain interactive features. The expressive capabilities of technology offers a broad base from which to integrate. It enhances the experience for both the author and audience and allows for greater interactivity.\n\nWith the arrival of new media devices like computers, digital cameras, recorders, smart phones, and software, individuals may share their digital stories via the Internet, on discs, podcasts, or other electronic media. Digital storytelling combines the art of storytelling with multimedia features such as photography, text, audio, voiceover, hypertext and video. Digital tools and software make it easy and convenient to create a digital story. Common software includes iMovie and Movie Maker for user-friendly options. There are other online options and free applications as well such as WeVideo.\n\nEducators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voice-over narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for \"reader\" participation. It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content.\n\nAdditionally, distinctions may be drawn between Web 2.0 storytelling and that of digital storytelling. Web 2.0 storytelling is said to produce a network of connections via social networking, blogging, and YouTube that transcends beyond the traditional, singular flow of digital storytelling. It tends to \"aggregate large amounts of microcontent and creatively select patterns out of an almost unfathomable volume of information,\" therefore the bounds of Web 2.0 storytelling are not necessarily clear.\n\nAnother form of digital storytelling is the micromovie, which is \"a very short exposition lasting from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes in length. It allows the teller to combine personal writing, photographic images or video footage, narrative, sound effects, and music. Many people, regardless of skill level, are able to tell their stories through image and sound and share those stories with others.\"\n\nTelling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media. Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point. The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound. Another outlet for digital storytelling can be articulated through some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where one might be constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of one's life. \"A story can be as short as explaining how one misplaced one's keys in the morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography.\" The wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules. However, there are certain guidelines that are tried and true over time that make up better stories. The most important rule is don't be boring, tell a good story and the \"truth\" of a \"story\" lies in a process not the content. Joe Lambert and others who work at Storycenter and other places around the world train people in how to improve their stories during digital storytelling workshops by writing out the story and discussing many options of connecting with the material before recording it in a digital format and editing it into video. When one wants to capture the attention of one's audience, it is important to be passionate about the themes and or characters when telling any story. In order to sell the story, regardless of the medium, the artist may need to ask oneself about what stories could be more compelling before relating the story to others. Some of the best stories begin with one's own personal insights in order to find an interesting and profound dramatic story.\n\nThe StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model has also been adopted in education, especially in the US, sometimes as a method of building engagement and multimedia literacy. For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition and Youthworx Media Melbourne and the UK social enterprise Noise Solution employ digital storytelling to engage and empower young people at risk.\n\n\"The idea of merging traditional storytelling with today's digital tools is spreading worldwide.\" Anybody today with a computer can create a digital story simply by answering such questions as \"What do you think? What do you feel? What is important? How do we find meaning in our lives?\" Most digital stories focus on a specific topic and contain a particular point of view. \"These topics can range from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe and every story in between.\"\n\nFor primary grades the focus is related to what is being taught, a story that will relate to the students. For primary grades the story is kept under five minutes to retain attention. Vibrant pictures, age-appropriate music and narration are needed. Narration accompanied by subtitles can also help build vocabulary. Content-related digital stories can help upper-elementary and middle-school students understand abstract or layered concepts. For example, in one 5th grade class a teacher used digital storytelling to depict the anatomy of the eye and describe its relationship to a camera. A fifth grader said, \"This year I have learned that places are not just physical matter but emotional places in peoples' hearts. iMovie has made all my thoughts and feelings come alive in an awesome movie.\"\n\nThese aspects of digital storytelling, pictures, music, and narration reinforce ideas and appeal to different learning types. Teachers can use it to introduce projects, themes, or any content area, and can also let their students make their own digital stories and then share them. Teachers can create digital stories to help facilitate class discussions, as an anticipatory set for a new topic, or to help students gain a better understanding of more abstract concepts. These stories can become an integral part of any lesson in many subject areas. Students can also create their own digital stories and the benefits that they can receive from it can be quite plentiful. Through the creation of these stories students are required to take ownership of the material they are presenting. They have to analyze and synthesize information as well. All of this supports higher-level thinking. Students are able to give themselves a voice through expressing their own thoughts and ideas.\n\nWhen students are able to participate in the multiple steps of designing, creating and presenting their own digital stories, they can build several literacy skills. These include the following: Research skills by finding and analyzing information when documenting the story, writing skills when developing a script, and organization skills by managing the scope of the project within a time constraint. Learning about the use of technology is a skill that can be gained through learning to use a variety of tools, such as digital cameras and multimedia authoring software and presentation skills through the presentation of the story to an audience. Students also gain interview, interpersonal, problem-solving and assessment skills through completing their digital story and learning to receive and give constructive criticism.\n\nSoftware such as iMovie, Photo Story 3 or Movie Maker do all that is required.\n\nFaculty and graduate students at the University of Houston have created a website, The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling, which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.\n\nThe National Writing Project has a collaboration with the Pearson Foundation examining the literacy practices, the values, attitudes, beliefs and feelings, associated with their digital storytelling work with students.\n\nTeachers can incorporate digital storytelling into their instruction for several reasons. Two reasons include 1) to incorporate multimedia into their curriculum and 2) teachers can also introduce storytelling in combination with social networking in order to increase global participation, collaboration, and communication skills. Moreover, digital storytelling is a way to incorporate and teach the twenty-first century student the twenty-first century technology skills such as information literacy, visual literacy, global awareness, communication and technology literacy.\n\nThe educational goals for teachers using digital storytelling are to generate interest, attention and motivation for students of the \"digital generation\" in classrooms. The use of digital storytelling as a presentation tool also appeals to the diverse learning styles of students. Digital storytelling also capitalizes on students' creative talents and allows their work to be published on the Internet for others to view and critique.\n\nA handful of teachers around the world have embraced digital storytelling from a mobile platform. The use of small handheld devices allows teachers and students to create short digital stories without the need for expensive editing software. iOS devices are the norm nowadays and mobile digital storytelling applications like The Fold Game have introduced an entirely new set of tools for the classroom.\n\nWith an emphasis on collaborative learning and hands on teaching, this website offers an in-depth look at how to integrate 21st-century skills with the objectives of a rigorous academic program:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20141105023109/http://nafcollaborationnetwork.org/curriculum-instruction/ci-pbl-ds.html\n\nDigital storytelling spread in higher education in the late nineties with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) collaborating with a number of Universities while based at UC Berkeley. StoryCenter programs with the New Media Consortium led to links to many campuses where programs in digital storytelling have grown; these include University of Maryland Baltimore, Cal State Monterey, Ohio State University, Williams College, MIT, and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The University of Colorado, Denver, Kean University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, Swarthmore College, the University of Calgary, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), the Maricopa County Community Colleges (AZ), and others have developed programs.. The University of Utah offered its first class on digital storytelling (Writing 3040) in the Fall of 2010. The program has grown from 10 students the first semester to over 30 in 2011, including 5 graduate students. Chicago journalist Mark Tatge started a Digital Storytelling program at DePauw University in 2011. Students learned journalistic-style storytelling techniques and published the resulting stories on a class website.\n\nThe distribution of digital storytelling among humanities faculty connected with the American Studies Crossroads Project was a further evolution through a combination of both personal and academic storytelling. Starting in 2001, Rina Benmayor (from California State University-Monterey Bay) hosted a StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) seminar and began using digital storytelling in her Latino/a life stories classes. Benmayor began sharing that work with faculty across the country involved in the Visible Knowledge Project including Georgetown University; LaGuardia Community College, CUNY; Millersville University; Vanderbilt University, and University of Wisconsin–Stout. Out of this work emerged publications in several key academic journals as well as the Digital Storytelling Multimedia Archive.\n\nBall State University has a masters program in digital storytelling based in the Telecommunications Department, as does the University of Oslo.\n\nIn 2011, the University of Mary Washington launched an open online course in digital storytelling titled DS106. The course includes credit-seeking students at the University as well as many open, online participants from around the world.\n\nDigital storytelling is also used as an instructional strategy to not only build relationships and establish people's social presence online but also as an alternative format to present content.\n\nThe development of the Silence Speaks project in 1999 under the direction of Amy Hill (who joined the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) in 2005) led to the expansion of digital storytelling in public health. Projects developed with the Centers for Disease Control, the Open Society Foundation, work in gender-based violence prevention with groups in California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, and with the organization Sonke Gender Justice in South Africa, the broad use of digital storytelling with Foster Youth, and finally the connection to digital storytelling to public campaigns in substance abuse prevention and community mental health programs.\n\nDigital storytelling is being used to raise awareness of the \"human\" factors in healthcare.\n\nThe Patient Voices programme is the product of Pip Hardy and Tony Sumner. Established in 2003, their project provides a means for people (patients, families or healthcare workers) to tell their stories which might affect clinicians, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare arena. The Programme has worked closely with The Royal College of Nursing, The National Clinical Governance Support Team, The National Audit Office, NHS England, NHS Improving Quality, Imperial College Healthcare Trust, Kings College London, University College London and many other NHS organisations and universities. Patient Voices projects have also taken place in Canada, Australia, Norway, Hong Kong and Tanzania and the stories are used in schools of medicine and healthcare throughout the world to prompt reflection and stimulate discussion and debate.\n\nThe Patient Voices programme also provides a freely accessible resource to anyone who desires to improve the quality of health and social care. All stories, once released, are available at The Patient Voices. The stories have contributed to an understanding of patients' experiences and their role in their illness as well as to a greater understanding of the experience of people who work in healthcare.\n\nIn addition, the process of creating a Patient Voices digital story has been used to enhance the reflective skills of newly qualified nurses and medical students.\n\nDigital Storytelling is also being used as therapy. Kim Anderson, who has a Ph.D. in licensed clinical social work has worked with Digital Storytelling with clients suffering from domestic violence, abuse, incest, and other traumatic psychological situations. Her work was used at the University of Southern California, the Zur Institute, and in numerous other publications including one in a chapter in a book on film/video-based therapy while teaching at the University of Southern Florida.\n\nDigital storytelling is being used by many different museums.\n\nThe largest project, \"Culture Shock!\", is currently taking place in the North East of England. This project is using museum and gallery collections to inspire people to create their own digital stories, which are also being added to the relevant museum collections.\n\nAnother large-scale project is the work of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.\n\nThe National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. also held a series of classes to integrate arts education curriculum with digital storytelling from 2003-2005.\n\nSome museums help interpret and make community history accessible. In 2007, the Colorado Historical Society collaborated with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) to create a program, \"The Italians,\" about Italian American History. In 2008, a group of eleven museums in Yorkshire launched \"My Yorkshire,\" a digital storytelling project. The museums work with communities to use contemporary collected oral histories alongside those from archives to interpret local history from a personal point of view, through the use of historical oral recordings and archival photos. The group has also produced help guides to creating digital stories in a museum setting.\n\nFinished digital stories can have many uses: advertising an upcoming exhibition, preserving a short-term project, building relations with communities. They provide skills to volunteers and can be permanently displayed in galleries.\n\nIn 2005, the Church of Norway initiated a project wherein young people raised questions of faith and life in short biographical mini-films called 'Digital Faith Stories'. A study of this project in a congregation near Oslo found that the method of 'Digital Storytelling' could contribute to a more systematic educational method for including the lifeworld of the young in religious training.\n\nA digital story station is a public space for people to create a digital story that serves to archive oral histories from the public perspective. These oral stories may focus on a personal experience, incident, describing a place or witnessing an event. Based on the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model, over 30 public libraries ranging from Northern down the coast to Southern California have a place for people to tell their own story.\n\nBilingual library staff work with participants to create a recording using the digital station, which can be integrated with a variety of media, including audio, video, pictures, and images. The digital storytelling station project called \"California of the Past\" is funded by a grant from the California State Library, U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Technology Act, and administered in California by librarians. The Media Arts Center in San Diego facilitates this project.\n\nSince 2006, San Diego has housed a story station in its downtown library. The Media Arts Center of San Diego partnered with the downtown public library to set up a story station where the public can create a three-minute video. The topics of the archived videos range from personal to historical documentaries.\n\nWith the development of marketing in the digital world is digital storytelling implemented in business.\nDigital storytelling is used as a tool of user-generated content, when consumers contribute their opinion based on their own experiences about a product to promote a firm's product in the digital world.\n\nDigital storytelling is being used by innovative startups to pitch their ideas to the potential investors and to communicate with potential customers to get feedback about the market potential of their product or service.\nThe Enterprise Center with Salem State University organized a Big Idea Video Pitch Contest competition for students to submit a 60-second video pitch of a unique idea for a business, non-profit or social cause. People could vote once per day using the \"vote now\" button that is displayed in the voting section. The Digital Story that receives the most votes was awarded. Videos were judged on originality, creativity, and the clarity of message.\nProject SomePitching is a crowdsourced online competition for new business ideas and early stage startups to provide feedback on their product and business ideas. The freeform explanation could be a website, a short pitching video or an animation (max. 90 seconds), a slideset (max. 5 pages with font size 20+), or any other material (or combination of materials) that was short and clear for anyone to evaluate.\n\nSomePitching used the Innopinion platform to manage the idea rating process and the selection of winners based on the ratings from both the public and professional jury.\n\nThe intent of this competition wasn't to present the best Big Idea of the product, service, or solution only, but also to find the way, how to interpret it by Digital Story the best way from visual and narrative point of view. Because in the public jury phase, the evaluations was based on the following categories (with percent of the final score):\n\nThe Canadian Film Centre's New Media Lab (formerly MediaLinx Habitat) launched a project, Murmur, out of the 2002–2003 studio. The project integrates audio interviews into cellphone-based tours. StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) created Storymapping.org in 2006 with projects in Mendocino (California), Houston, New Orleans, and Tuscaloosa (Alabama) to promote the connection between storytelling and issues of local memory and civic planning.\n\nThe Voice Library (TVL) launched two, ongoing, social-giving projects in 2014. \"The Military Families Story Project\", based out of Portsmouth, NH, maintains and strengthens families' ties, builds morale through a brother-/sisterhood network, enables service men and women and their families to record history as they make it, and memorializes veterans' experiences. TVL's national \"Let Me Be Your Memory\" project, in collaboration with Cognitive Dynamics, offers a unique, six-week audio-based archiving Language Arts curriculum for students and educational institutions that builds multiple, Common Core-adaptable competencies by raising awareness of those living with memory disorders and their caregivers. It stimulates students to learn, investigate, and connect with family and community. The Voice Library changes the digital storytelling paradigm by providing users passcode-protected access through any telephone technology. It also provides online access. Both combine audio and still-image capability. For 24/7, global access, unlike social media, subscribers' private accounts are secured on the company's server.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1835001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835001", "title": "Nakayama's lemma", "text": "Nakayama's lemma\n\nIn mathematics, more specifically abstract algebra and commutative algebra, Nakayama's lemma — also known as the Krull–Azumaya theorem — governs the interaction between the Jacobson radical of a ring (typically a commutative ring) and its finitely generated modules. Informally, the lemma immediately gives a precise sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring behave like vector spaces over a field. It is an important tool in algebraic geometry, because it allows local data on algebraic varieties, in the form of modules over local rings, to be studied pointwise as vector spaces over the residue field of the ring.\n\nThe lemma is named after the Japanese mathematician Tadashi Nakayama and introduced in its present form in , although it was first discovered in the special case of ideals in a commutative ring by Wolfgang Krull and then in general by Goro Azumaya (1951). In the commutative case, the lemma is a simple consequence of a generalized form of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, an observation made by Michael Atiyah (1969). The special case of the noncommutative version of the lemma for right ideals appears in Nathan Jacobson (1945), and so the noncommutative Nakayama lemma is sometimes known as the Jacobson–Azumaya theorem. The latter has various applications in the theory of Jacobson radicals.\n\nLet \"R\" be a commutative ring with identity 1. The following is Nakayama's lemma, as stated in :\n\nStatement 1: Let \"I\" be an ideal in \"R\", and \"M\" a finitely-generated module over \"R\". If \"IM\" = \"M\", then there exists an \"r\" ∈ \"R\" with \"r\" ≡ 1 (mod \"I\"), such that \"rM\" = 0.\n\nThis is proven below.\n\nThe following corollary is also known as Nakayama's lemma, and it is in this form that it most often appears.\n\nStatement 2: If \"M\" is a finitely-generated module over \"R\", J(\"R\") is the Jacobson radical of \"R\", and J(\"R\")\"M\" = \"M\", then \"M\" = 0.\n\nMore generally, one has that J(\"R\")\"M\" is a superfluous submodule of \"M\" when \"M\" is finitely-generated.\n\nStatement 3: If \"M\" is a finitely-generated module over \"R\", \"N\" is a submodule of \"M\", and \"M\" = \"N\" + J(\"R\")\"M\", then \"M\" = \"N\".\n\nThe following result manifests Nakayama's lemma in terms of generators.\n\nStatement 4: If \"M\" is a finitely-generated module over \"R\" and the images of elements \"m\"...,\"m\" of \"M\" in \"M\" / \"J\"(\"R\")\"M\" generate \"M\" / \"J\"(\"R\")\"M\" as an \"R\"-module, then \"m\"...,\"m\" also generate \"M\" as an \"R\"-module.\n\nIf one assumes instead that \"R\" is complete and \"M\" is separated with respect to the \"I\"-adic topology for an ideal \"I\" in \"R\", this last statement holds with \"I\" in place of \"J\"(\"R\") and without assuming in advance that \"M\" is finitely generated. Here separatedness means that the \"I\"-adic topology satisfies the \"T\" separation axiom, and is equivalent to formula_1\n\nIn the special case of a finitely generated module \"M\" over a local ring \"R\" with maximal ideal \"m\", the quotient \"M\"/\"mM\" is a vector space over the field \"R\"/\"m\". Statement 4 then implies that a basis of \"M\"/\"mM\" lifts to a minimal set of generators of \"M\". Conversely, every minimal set of generators of \"M\" is obtained in this way, and any two such sets of generators are related by an invertible matrix with entries in the ring.\n\nIn this form, Nakayama's lemma takes on concrete geometrical significance. Local rings arise in geometry as the germs of functions at a point. Finitely generated modules over local rings arise quite often as germs of sections of vector bundles. Working at the level of germs rather than points, the notion of finite-dimensional vector bundle gives way to that of a coherent sheaf. Informally, Nakayama's lemma says that one can still regard a coherent sheaf as coming from a vector bundle in some sense. More precisely, let \"F\" be a coherent sheaf of O-modules over an arbitrary scheme \"X\". The stalk of \"F\" at a point \"p\" ∈ \"X\", denoted by \"F\", is a module over the local ring O. The fibre of \"F\" at \"p\" is the vector space \"F\"(\"p\") = \"F\"/\"mF\" where \"m\" is the maximal ideal of O. Nakayama's lemma implies that a basis of the fibre \"F\"(\"p\") lifts to a minimal set of generators of \"F\". That is:\n\nThe going up theorem is essentially a corollary of Nakayama's lemma. It asserts:\n\n\nNakayama's lemma makes precise one sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring are like vector spaces over a field. The following consequence of Nakayama's lemma gives another way in which this is true:\n\n\nOver a local ring, one can say more about module epimorphisms:\n\n\nNakayama's lemma also has several versions in homological algebra. The above statement about epimorphisms can be used to show:\n\nA geometrical and global counterpart to this is the Serre–Swan theorem, relating projective modules and coherent sheaves.\n\nMore generally, one has\n\nA standard proof of the Nakayama lemma uses the following technique due to .\n\nThis assertion is precisely a generalized version of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, and the proof proceeds along the same lines. On the generators \"x\" of \"M\", one has a relation of the form\nwhere \"a\" ∈ \"I\". Thus\nThe required result follows by multiplying by the adjugate of the matrix (φδ − \"a\") and invoking Cramer's rule. One finds then det(φδ − \"a\") = 0, so the required polynomial is\n\nTo prove Nakayama's lemma from the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, assume that \"IM\" = \"M\" and take φ to be the identity on \"M\". Then define a polynomial \"p\"(\"x\") as above. Then\nhas the required property.\n\nA version of the lemma holds for right modules over non-commutative unital rings \"R\". The resulting theorem is sometimes known as the Jacobson–Azumaya theorem.\n\nLet J(\"R\") be the Jacobson radical of \"R\". If \"U\" is a right module over a ring, \"R\", and \"I\" is a right ideal in \"R\", then define \"U·I\" to be the set of all (finite) sums of elements of the form \"u·i\", where · is simply the action of \"R\" on \"U\". Necessarily, \"U·I\" is a submodule of \"U\".\n\nIf \"V\" is a maximal submodule of \"U\", then \"U\"/\"V\" is simple. So \"U·J(\"R\") is necessarily a subset of \"V\", by the definition of J(\"R\") and the fact that \"U\"/\"V\" is simple. Thus, if \"U\" contains at least one (proper) maximal submodule, \"U·J(\"R\") is a proper submodule of \"U\". However, this need not hold for arbitrary modules \"U\" over \"R\", for \"U\" need not contain any maximal submodules. Naturally, if \"U\" is a Noetherian module, this holds. If \"R\" is Noetherian, and \"U\" is finitely generated, then \"U\" is a Noetherian module over \"R\", and the conclusion is satisfied. Somewhat remarkable is that the weaker assumption, namely that \"U\" is finitely generated as an \"R\"-module (and no finiteness assumption on \"R\"), is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion. This is essentially the statement of Nakayama's lemma.\n\nPrecisely, one has:\n\nLet formula_9 be a finite subset of formula_10, minimal with respect to the property that it generates formula_10. Since formula_10 is non-zero, this set formula_9 is nonempty. Denote every element of formula_9 by formula_15 for formula_16. Since formula_9 generates formula_10,formula_19.\n\nSuppose formula_20, to obtain a contradiction. Then every element formula_21can be expressed as a finite combination formula_22 for some formula_23.\n\nEach formula_24 can be further decomposed as formula_25 for some formula_26. Therefore, we have\n\nformula_27.\n\nSince formula_28 is a (two-sided) ideal in formula_29, we have formula_30 for every formula_31, and thus this becomes\n\nPutting formula_35 and applying distributivity, we obtain\n\nChoose some formula_37. If the right ideal formula_38 were proper, then it would be contained in a maximal right ideal formula_39 and both formula_40 and formula_41 would belong to formula_42, leading to a contradiction (note that formula_43 by the definition of the Jacobson radical). Thus formula_44 and formula_40 has a right inverse formula_46 in formula_29. We have\n\nTherefore,\n\nThus formula_50 is a linear combination of the elements from formula_51. This contradicts the minimality of formula_9 and establishes the result.\n\nThere is also a graded version of Nakayama's lemma. Let \"R\" be a ring that is graded by the ordered semigroup of non-negative integers, and let formula_53 denote the ideal generated by positively graded elements. Then if \"M\" is a graded module over \"R\" for which formula_54 for \"i\" sufficiently negative (in particular, if \"M\" is finitely generated and \"R\" does not contain elements of negative degree) such that formula_55, then formula_56. Of particular importance is the case that \"R\" is a polynomial ring with the standard grading, and \"M\" is a finitely generated module.\n\nThe proof is much easier than in the ungraded case: taking \"i\" to be the least integer such that formula_57, we see that formula_58 does not appear in formula_59, so either formula_60, or such an \"i\" does not exist, i.e., formula_56.\n\n\n"}

The original Greek bronze is lost but the work is known through numerous Roman copies, both full-scale ones in marble, which was cheaper than bronze, such as the first to be recovered, the \"Palombara Discobolus\", and smaller scaled versions in bronze.\n\nA discus thrower depicted is about to release his throw: \"by sheer intelligence\", Kenneth Clark observed in \"The Nude\", \"Myron has created the enduring pattern of athletic energy. He has taken a moment of action so transitory that students of athletics still debate if it is feasible, and he has given it the completeness of a cameo.\" The moment thus captured in the statue is an example of \"rhythmos\", harmony and balance. Myron is often credited with being the first sculptor to master this style. Naturally, as always in Greek athletics, the \"Discobolus\" is completely nude. His pose is said to be unnatural to a human, and today considered a rather inefficient way to throw the discus. Also there is very little emotion shown in the discus thrower's face, and \"to a modern eye, it may seem that Myron's desire for perfection has made him suppress too rigorously the sense of strain in the individual muscles,\" Clark observes. The other trademark of Myron embodied in this sculpture is how well the body is proportioned, the \"symmetria\".\n\nThe potential energy expressed in this sculpture's tightly wound pose, expressing the moment of stasis just before the release, is an example of the advancement of Classical sculpture from Archaic. The torso shows no muscular strain, however, even though the limbs are outflung.\n\nMyron's \"Discobolus\" was long known from descriptions, such as the dialogue in Lucian of Samosata's work \"Philopseudes\":\n\nPrior to this statue's discovery the term \"Discobolus\" had been applied in the 17th and 18th centuries to a standing figure holding a discus, a \"Discophoros\", which Ennio Quirino Visconti identified as the \"Discobolus\" of Naukydes of Argos, mentioned by Pliny (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).\n\nThe \"Discobolus Palombara\", the first copy of this famous sculpture to have been discovered, was found in 1781. It is a 1st-century AD copy of Myron's original bronze. Following its discovery at a Roman property of the Massimo family, the Villa Palombara on the Esquiline Hill, it was initially restored by Giuseppe Angelini; the Massimi installed it initially in their Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne and then at Palazzo Lancellotti. The Italian archaeologist Giovanni Battista Visconti identified the sculpture as a copy from the original of Myron. It was instantly famous, though the Massimo jealously guarded access to it (Haskell and Penny 1981:200).\n\nIn 1937 Adolf Hitler negotiated to buy it, and eventually succeeded in 1938, when Galeazzo Ciano, Minister of Foreign Affairs, sold it to him for five million lire, over the protests of Giuseppe Bottai, Minister of Education, and the scholarly community. It was shipped by rail to Munich and displayed in the Glyptothek; it was returned in 1948. It is now in the National Museum of Rome, displayed at the Palazzo Massimo.\n\nAfter the discovery of the \"Discobolus Palombara\" a second notable \"Discobolus\" was excavated, at Hadrian's Villa in 1790, and was purchased by the English antiquary and art dealer established in Rome, Thomas Jenkins, at public auction in 1792. (Another example, also found at Tivoli at this date, was acquired by the Vatican Museums.) The English connoisseur Charles Townley paid Jenkins £400 for the statue, which arrived at the semi-public gallery Townley commissioned in Park Street, London, in 1794. The head was wrongly restored, as Richard Payne Knight soon pointed out, but Townley was convinced his was the original and better copy.\n\nIt was bought for the British Museum, with the rest of Townley's marbles, in July 1805.\n\nOther Roman copies in marble have been recovered, and torsos that were already known in the 17th century but that had been wrongly restored and completed, have since been identified as further repetitions after Myron's model. For one such example, in the early 18th century Pierre-Étienne Monnot restored a torso that is now recognized as an example of Myron's \"Discobolus\" as a \"Wounded Gladiator\" who supports himself on his arm as he sinks to the ground; the completed sculpture was donated before 1734 by Pope Clement XII to the Capitoline Museums, where it remains.\n\nYet another copy was discovered in 1906 in the ruins of a Roman villa at Tor Paterno in the former royal estate of Castel Porziano, now also conserved in the Museo Nazionale Romano.\n\nIn the 19th century plaster copies of \"Discobolos\" could be found in many large academic collections, now mostly dispersed.\n\n\n"}

It is distributed in sub-Saharan Africa and with one species, \"C. grandis\" also in South and South-east Asia, and it is also introduced into the New World. Incidentally, \"C. grandis\" is also a cultivated crop and it is used for culinary and medical purposes.\n\n\"Coccinia\" species are perennial climbing or creeping herbs. Climbing is supported by simple of unequally bifid tendrils. Most species develop a tuber from the hypocotyl, sometimes on roots. The cotyledons are simple, entire and have an blunt tip. The leaves are usually stalked, rarely sessile. The leaves are simple to deeply lobed, usually with teeth along the margin. The lower leaf side often bears small nectar-producing glands.\n\n\"Coccinia\" species are dioecious, meaning that individual plants produce flowers with only male or only female organs. The sepals are connected and have five triangulate to lineal lobes. The corolla is also connected at the base and has five free lobes. The color of the corolla is creamy white to yellowish orange, rarely also snow-white or pinkish.\nThe male flowers are solitary, in fascicles or often in racemes, female flowers are usually solitary, sometimes also in racemes. Male flowers have three stamens that are connected to a single filament column. The anthers form a globose head. The pollen is produced in S-shaped thecae. Female flowers have an inferior ovary consisting of three carpels and producing a single style. Each carpel ends in a bulging or 2-lobed stigma. Whereas male flowers lack any sign of female organs, female flowers contain three sterile stamens (staminodes). The fruit is a berry with red flesh and a red skin that rarely exhibits a white longitudinal mottling. The seeds are enclosed in a juicy hull (aril), grayish-beige, flat to lentil-shaped.\n\nAll species occur in sub-Saharan Africa, from semi-arid savannas to rain forests, rarely also mountain forests. The species adapted to these different habitats one to several times independently.\n\nThe genus \"Coccinia\" is best known for \"C. grandis\", commonly known as \"ivy gourd\". It fruits can be eaten raw when ripe or cooked when unripe. In the latter case, it is used in curries. Young leaves and shoots are also edible. All used plants are a good source of carotenoids. The tuber of \"Coccinia abyssinica\" is cooked and a source of starch for the Oromo people in Ethiopia. Local culinary uses also exist. However, many species and also populations within species can be bitter due to cucurbitacins.\n\n\"Coccinia grandis\" is also well known in ayurvedic medicine for diabetes treatment, and modern research seems to confirm that it might be of value in that application.\n"}

{"id": "1835064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835064", "title": "Sociology of health and illness", "text": "Sociology of health and illness\n\nThe sociology of health and illness, alternatively the sociology of health and wellness (or simply health sociology), examines the interaction between society and health. The objective of this topic is to see how social life affects morbidity and mortality rate, and vice versa. This aspect of sociology differs from medical sociology in that this branch of sociology discusses health and illness in relation to social institutions such as family, employment, and school. The sociology of medicine limits its concern to the patient-practitioner relationship and the role of health professionals in society. The sociology of health and illness covers sociological pathology (causes of disease and illness), reasons for seeking particular types of medical aid, and patient compliance or noncompliance with medical regimes.\n\nHealth, or lack of health, was once merely attributed to biological or natural conditions. Sociologists have demonstrated that the spread of diseases is heavily influenced by the socioeconomic status of individuals, ethnic traditions or beliefs, and other cultural factors. Where medical research might gather statistics on a disease, a sociological perspective on an illness would provide insight on what external factors caused the demographics who contracted the disease to become ill.\n\nThis topic requires a global approach of analysis because the influence of societal factors varies throughout the world. This will be demonstrated through discussion of the major diseases of each continent. These diseases are sociologically examined and compared based on the traditional medicine, economics, religion, and culture that is specific to each region. HIV/AIDS serves as a common basis of comparison among regions. While it is extremely problematic in certain areas, in others it has affected a relatively small percentage of the population. Sociological factors can help to explain why these discrepancies exist.\n\nThere are obvious differences in patterns of health and illness across societies, over time, and within particular society types. There has historically been a long-term decline in mortality within industrialized societies, and on average, life-expectancies are considerably higher in developed, rather than developing or undeveloped, societies. Patterns of global change in health care systems make it more imperative than ever to research and comprehend the sociology of health and illness. Continuous changes in economy, therapy, technology and insurance can affect the way individual communities view and respond to the medical care available. These rapid fluctuations cause the issue of health and illness within social life to be very dynamic in definition. Advancing information is vital because as patterns evolve, the study of the sociology of health and illness constantly needs to be updated.\n\nHumans have long sought advice from those with knowledge or skill in healing. Paleopathology and other historical records, allow an examination of how ancient societies dealt with illness and outbreak. Rulers in Ancient Egypt sponsored physicians that were specialists in specific diseases. Imhotep was the first medical doctor known by name. An Egyptian who lived around 2650 B.C., he was an adviser to King Zoser at a time when Egyptians were making progress in medicine. Among his contributions to medicine was a textbook on the treatment of wounds, broken bones, and even tumors.\n\nStopping the spread of infectious disease was of utmost importance for maintaining a healthy society. The outbreak of disease during the Peloponnesian War was recorded by Thucydides who survived the epidemic. From his account it is shown how factors outside the disease itself can affect society. The Athenians were under siege and concentrated within the city. Major city centers were the hardest hit. This made the outbreak even more deadly and with probable food shortages the fate of Athens was inevitable. Approximately 25% of the population died of the disease. Thucydides stated that the epidemic \"carried away all alike\". The disease attacked people of different ages, sexes and nationalities.\nAncient medical systems stressed the importance of reducing illness through divination and ritual. Other codes of behavior and dietary protocols were widespread in the ancient world. During the Zhou Dynasty in China, doctors suggested exercise, meditation and temperance to preserve one's health. The Chinese closely link health with spiritual well-being. Health regimes in ancient India focused on oral health as the best method for a healthy life. The Talmudic code created rules for health which stressed ritual cleanliness, connected disease with certain animals and created diets. Other examples include the Mosaic Code and Roman baths and aqueducts.\n\nThose that were most concerned with health, sanitation and illness in the ancient world were those in the elite class. Good health was thought to reduce the risk of spiritual defilement and therefore enhanced the social status of the ruling class who saw themselves as the beacon of civilization. During the late Roman Period, sanitation for the lower classes was a concern for the leisured class. Those that had the means would donate to charities that focused on the health of non-elites. After the decline of the Roman Empire, physicians and concern with public health disappeared except in the largest cities. Health and public doctors remained in the Byzantine Empire. Focusing on preventing the spread of diseases such as small pox lead to a smaller mortality rate in much of the western world. Other factors that allowed the modern rise in population include: better nutrition and environmental reforms (such as getting clean water supplies).\n\nThe present day sense of health being a public concern for the state began in the Middle Ages. A few state interventions include maintaining clean towns, enforcing quarantines during epidemics and supervising sewer systems. Private corporations also played a role in public health. The funding for research and the institutions for them to work were funded by governments and private firms. Epidemics were the cause of most government interventions. The early goal of public health was reactionary whereas the modern goal is to prevent disease before it becomes a problem. Despite the overall improvement of world health, there still has not been any decrease in the health gap between the affluent and the impoverished. Today, society is more likely to blame health issues on the individual rather than society as a whole. This was the prevailing view in the late 20th century. In the 1980s the Black Report, published in the United Kingdom, went against this view and argued that the true root of the problem was material deprivation. This report proposed a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy to address these issues. Since this did not parallel the views of the Conservative government, it did not go into action immediately. The Conservative government was criticized by the Labour Party for not implementing the suggestions that the Black Report listed. This criticism gave the Black Report the exposure it needed and its arguments were considered a valid explanation for health inequality. There is also a debate over whether poverty causes ill-health or if ill-health causes poverty. Arguments by the National Health Service gave considerable emphasis to poverty and lack of access to health care. It has also been found that heredity has more of a bearing on health than social environment, but research has also proved that there is indeed a positive correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and illness.\n\nMore recently, sociological studies following a life course perspective in health emphasised the limitations of the view linking health outcomes on individual agency only.\n\nThe Sociology of Health and Illness looks at three areas: the conceptualization, the study of measurement and social distribution, and the justification of patterns in health and illness. By looking at these things researchers can look at different diseases through a sociological lens. The prevalence and response to different diseases varies by culture. By looking at bad health, researchers can see if health affects different social regulations or controls. When measuring the distribution of health and illness, it is useful to look at official statistics and community surveys. Official statistics make it possible to look at people who have been treated. It shows that they are both willing and able to use health services. It also sheds light on the infected person's view of their illness. On the other hand, community surveys look at people's rating of their health. Then looking at the relation of clinically defined illness and self reports and find that there is often a discrepancy.\n\nA great deal of the time, mortality statistics take the place of the morbidity statistics because in many developed societies where people typically die from degenerative conditions, the age in which they die sheds more light on their life-time health. This produces many limitations when looking at the pattern of sickness, but sociologists try to look at various data to analyze the distribution better. Normally, developing societies have lower life expectancies in comparison to developed countries. They have also found correlations between mortality and sex and age. Very young and old people are more susceptible to sickness and death. On average women typically live longer than men, although women are more likely to have bad health.\nDisparities in health were also found between people in different social classes and ethnicities within the same society, even though in the medical profession they put more importance in “health related behaviors” such as alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise. There is a great deal of data supporting the conclusion that these behaviors affect health more significantly than other factors. Sociologists think that it is more helpful to look at health and illness through a broad lens. Sociologists agree that alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise are important issues, but they also see the importance of analyzing the cultural factors that affect these patterns. Sociologists also look at the effects that the productive process has on health and illness. While also looking at things such as industrial pollution, environmental pollution, accidents at work, and stress-related diseases.\n\nSocial factors play a significant role in developing health and illness. Studies of epidemiology show that autonomy and control in the workplace are vital factors in the etiology of heart disease. One cause is an effort-reward imbalance. Decreasing career advancement opportunities and major imbalances in control over work have been coupled with various negative health costs. Various studies have shown that pension rights may shed light on mortality differences between retired men and women of different socioeconomic statuses. These studies show that there are outside factors that influence health and illness.\n\nHIV/AIDS is the leading epidemic that affects the social welfare of Africa. Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause AIDS which is an acronym for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening infections. Two-thirds of the world's HIV population is located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the epidemic started more than 15 million Africans have died by complications with HIV/AIDS.\n\nPeople apart of religious sub-groups of Sub-Saharan Africa and those who actively and frequently participate in religious activities are more likely to be at a lower risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. On the opposite end, there are many beliefs that an infected male can be cured of the infection by having sex with a virgin. These beliefs increase the number of people with the virus and also increase the number of rapes against women.\n\nHerbal treatment is one of the primary medicines used to treat HIV in Africa. It is used more than standard treatment because it is more affordable. Herbal treatment is more affordable but is not researched and is poorly regulated . This lack of research on whether the herbal medicines work and what the medicines consist of is a major flaw in the healing cycle of HIV in Africa.\n\nEconomically, HIV has a significant negative effect. The labor force in Africa is slowly diminishing, due to HIV-related deaths and illness. In response, government income declines and so does tax revenue. The government has to spend more money than it is making, in order to care for those affected with HIV/AIDS.\n\nA major social problem in Africa in regards to HIV is the orphan epidemic. The orphan epidemic in Africa is a regional problem. In most cases, both of the parents are affected with HIV. Due to this, the children are usually raised by their grandmothers and in extreme cases they are raised by themselves. In order to care for the sick parents, the children have to take on more responsibility by working to produce an income. Not only do the children lose their parents but they also lose their childhood as well. Having to provide care for their parents, the children also miss out on an education which increases the risk of teen pregnancy and people affected with HIV. The most efficient way to diminish the orphan epidemic is prevention: preventing children from acquiring HIV from their mothers at birth, as well as educating them on the disease as they grow older. Also, educating adults about HIV and caring for the infected people adequately will lower the orphan population.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic is reducing the average life expectancy of people in Africa by twenty years. The age range with the highest death rates, due to HIV, are those between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The fact that this age range is when adults acquire most of their income they cannot afford to send their children to school, due to the high medication costs. It also removes the people who could help aid in responding to the epidemic.\n\nAsian countries have wide variations of population, wealth, technology and health care, causing attitudes towards health and illness to differ. Japan, for example, has the third highest life expectancy (82 years old), while Afghanistan has the 11th worst (44 years old). Key issues in Asian health include childbirth and maternal health, HIV and AIDS, mental health, and aging and the elderly. These problems are influenced by the sociological factors of religion or belief systems, attempts to reconcile traditional medicinal practices with modern professionalism, and the economic status of the inhabitants of Asia.\nLike the rest of the world, Asia is threatened by a possible pandemic of HIV and AIDS. Vietnam is a good example of how society is shaping Asian HIV/AIDS awareness and attitudes towards this disease. Vietnam is a country with feudal, traditional roots, which, due to invasion, wars, technology and travel is becoming increasingly globalized. Globalization has altered traditional viewpoints and values. It is also responsible for the spread of HIV and AIDS in Vietnam. Even early globalization has added to this problem – Chinese influence made Vietnam a Confucian society, in which women are of less importance than men. Men in their superiority have no need to be sexually responsible, and women, generally not well educated, are often unaware of the risk, perpetuating the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as other STIs.\n\nConfucianism has had a strong influence on the belief system in Asia for centuries, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, and its influence can be seen in the way people chose to seek, or not seek, medical care. An important issue in Asia is societal effect on the ability of disabled individuals to adjust to a disability. Cultural beliefs shape attitudes towards physical and mental disabilities. China exemplifies this problem. According to Chinese Confucian tradition (which is also applicable in other countries where Confucianism has been spread), people should always pursue good health in their lives, with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. To the Chinese, having a disability signifies that one has not led a proper lifestyle and therefore there is a lack of opportunities for disabled individuals to explore better ways to accept or adapt to their disability.\n\nIndigenous healing practices are extremely diverse throughout Asia but often follow certain patterns and are still prevalent today. Many traditional healing practices include shamanism and herbal medicines, and may have been passed down orally in small groups or even institutionalized and professionalized. In many developing countries the only health care available until a few decades ago were those based on traditional medicine and spiritual healing. Now governments must be careful to create health policies that strike a balance between modernity and tradition. Organizations, like the World Health Organization, try to create policies that respect tradition without trying to replace it with modern science, instead regulating it to ensure safety but keeping it accessible. India in particular tries to make traditional medicines safe but still available to as many people as possible, adapting tradition to match modernization while still considering the economic positions and culture of its citizens.\nMental health issues are gaining an increasing amount of attention in the Asian countries. Many of these countries have a preoccupation with modernizing and developing their economies, resulting in cultural changes. In order to reconcile modern techniques with traditional practices, social psychologists in India are in the process of “indigenizing psychology”. Indigenous psychology is that which is derived from the laws, theories, principals, and ideas of a culture and unique to each society.\n\nIn many Asian countries, childbirth is still treated by traditional means and is thought of with regional attitudes. For example, in Pakistan, decisions concerning pregnancy and antenatal care (ANC) are usually made by older women, often the pregnant woman's mother-in-law, while the mother and father to be are distanced from the process. They may or may not receive professional ANC depending on their education, class, and financial situation. Generally in Asia, childbirth is still a woman's area and male obstetricians are rare. Female midwives and healers are still the norm in most places. Western methods are overtaking the traditional in an attempt to improve maternal health and increase the number of live births.\n\nAsian countries, which are mostly developing nations, are aging rapidly even as they are attempting to build their economies. Even wealthy Asian nations, such as Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan, also have very elderly populations and thus have to try to sustain their economies and society with small younger generations while caring for their elderly citizens. The elderly have been traditionally well respected and well cared for in most Asian cultures; experts predict that younger generations in the future are less likely to be concerned and involved in the health care of their older relatives due to various factors such as women joining the workforce more, the separation of families because of urbanization or migration, and the proliferation of Western ideals such as individualism.\n\nThe health patterns found on the continent of Australia which includes the Pacific Islands, have been very much influenced by European colonization. While indigenous medicinal beliefs are not significantly prevalent in Australia, traditional ideas are still influential in the health care problems in many of the islands of the Pacific. The rapid urbanization of Australia led to epidemics of typhoid fever and the Bubonic plague. Because of this, public health was professionalized beginning in the late 1870s in an effort to control these and other diseases. Since then Australia's health system has evolved similarly to Western countries and the main cultural influence affecting health care are the political ideologies of the parties in control of the government.\n\nAustralia has had treatment facilities for 'problem drinkers' since the 1870s. In the 1960s and 1970s it was recognized that Australia had several hundred thousand alcoholics and prevention became a priority over cures, as there was a societal consensus that treatments are generally ineffective. The government began passing laws attempting to curb alcohol consumption but consistently met opposition from the wine-making regions of southern Australia. The government has also waged a war on illegal drugs, particularly heroin, which in the 1950s became widely used as a pain reliever.\n\nExperts believe that many of the health problems in the Pacific Islands can be traced back to European colonization and the subsequent globalization and modernization of island communities. (See History of the Pacific Islands.) European colonization and late independence meant modernization but also slow economic growth, which had an enormous effect on health care, particularly on nutrition in the Pacific Islands. The end of colonization meant a loss of medical resources, and the fledgling independent governments could not afford to continue the health policies put in place by the colonial governments. Nutrition was changed radically, contributing to various other health problems. While more prosperous, urban areas could afford food, they chose poor diets, causing 'overnourishment', and leading to extremely high levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Poorer rural communities, on the other hand, continue to suffer from malnutrition and malaria.\n\nTraditional diets in the Pacific are very low in fat, but since World War II there has been a significant increase in fat and protein in Pacific diets. Native attitudes towards weight contribute to the obesity problem. Tongan natives see obesity as a positive thing, especially in men. They also believe that women should do as little physical work as possible while the men provide for them, meaning they get very little exercise.\n\nThe largest endeavors to improve health across Europe is the World Health Organization European Region. The goal is to improve the health of poor and disadvantaged populations by promoting healthy lifestyles including environmental, economic, social and providing health care. Overall health in Europe is very high compared to the rest of the world. The average life expectancy is around 78 in EU countries but there is a wide gap between Western and Eastern Europe. It is as low as 67 in Russia and 73 in the Balkan states. Europe is seeing an increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe because of a worsening socioeconomic situation. Cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes mellitus are more prevalent is Eastern Europe. The WHO claims that poverty is the most important factor bringing on ill health across Europe. Those at low socioeconomic status levels and many young people are also at risk because of their increased tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse. Health and illness prevention in Europe is largely funded by the governmental services including: regulating health care, insurance and social programs. The role of religion and traditional medicine, however, is often left unexamined in such reports.\n\nThe study of hypertension within the United Kingdom has turned to examining the role that beliefs play in its diagnosis and treatment. Hypertension is an essential topic for study since it is linked to increased risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. The most common treatment for hypertension is medication but compliance for this treatment plan is low. A study conducted in the UK examined the differences between 'white' patients and first generation immigrants from the West Indies. There were differing reasons for non-compliance that involve the patients' perception and beliefs about the diagnosis. Patients commonly believe that high levels of anxiety when first diagnosed are the major cause and think that when stress levels decline so too will their hypertension. Other respondents in this UK based study had varying beliefs concerning the necessity of medication while others still argued that it was the side effects of medication that made them end their prescribed regimen. West Indian respondents whose lay culture teaches them to reject long-term drug therapy opted instead for folk remedies in higher numbers than the 'white' respondents. What can be seen here is that some people will choose to ignore a doctor's expert advice and will employ 'lay consultation' instead.\nBefore people seek medical help they try to interpret the symptoms themselves and often consult people in their lives or use 'self-help' measures. A study of 'everyday illness' in Finland including: influenza, infections and musculo-skeletal problems focused on reasons for consulting medical experts and explanations of illness. These common illness were examined not because of their seriousness but because of their frequency. The researchers explain five possible triggers that people seek medical aid: 1- the occurrence of an interpersonal crisis 2- perceived interference with social and personal relations 3- perceived interference with vocational & physical activity 4- sanctioning by other people 5- sufferers ideas about how long certain complaints should last. These kind of explanatory models are part of the process that people use to construct medical culture. They give meaning to illness and health, answer questions about personal responsibility about health and most importantly are part of the dialogue between patients' and professionals' illness explanations. It can help explore why some patients will follow a doctors instructions to the letter and others ignore them completely. A patient's explanation or understanding of their illness can be much broader than a physician's and this dynamic has become a major criticism of modern medical practice since it normally excludes the \"social, psychological and experiential dimensions of illness.\"\n\nThe Finnish study examined 127 patients and the results have been different from findings in other countries where there is more 'lay consultation'. Half of the respondents did not have any lay consultation before coming to the doctors office. One-third did not try any self-treatment and three-quarters of the sample consulted the doctor within three days of symptoms developing. Possible explanations are that in Finland there is an aspect \"over-protectiveness\" within their health care system. Many might conclude that the Finnish people are dependent and helpless but the researchers of this study found that people chose to consult professionals because they trusted them over some lay explanation. These results echo similar studies in Ireland that explain this phenomenon as being based in a strong work ethic. Illness in these countries will affect their work and Finnish people will quickly get treatment so they can return to work. This research out of Finland also describes that this relationship between patient and doctor is based on:\n\nThe conflict between medical and lay worlds is prominent. On one hand many patients believe they are the expert of their own body and view the Doctor-patient relationship as authoritarian. These people will often use knowledge outside the medical field to deal with health and illness. Others see the doctor as the expert and are shy about describing their symptoms and therefore rely on the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn Europe, sociology of health and illness is represented by the European Society for Health and Medical Sociology (ESHMS).\n\nNorth America is a fairly recent settled continent, made up of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was built by an amalgamation of wealth, ideas, culture, and practices. North America is highly advanced intellectually, technologically, and traditionally. This advantageous character of North American nations has caused a high average life expectancy of 75 years for males and 80 years for females. This leads to the conclusion that North America has cultivated a comparatively healthy society. As North America contains several core nations, the growing economies in those nations are able to maintain and develop medical institutions. This subsequently provides more access to health care for American citizens but health care is not universal. North America is known for being a leading nation in regards to industrialization and modernization, but the United States lacks federal laws regarding health care as a basic human right. This lag of health care security causes subsequent issues with pharmaceutical competition, lack of care for the elderly, and little attention to alternative medicine. Health care and education are plentiful at a price and illness still persists for many reasons. A main reason is that a lower- and middle-class population still exists in plentiful numbers, maintaining a group that is highly vulnerable to physical ailment.\nNorth America's primary risk factors for illness are currently alcohol abuse, malnutrition, obesity, tobacco use, and water sanitation. Obesity is a recent epidemic in North America. The 1990s brought a rise in the average Body Mass Index, or BMI. From the beginning and to the end of the decade, the median percent of adults who were obese rose from 12% to 20%. Alcoholism is the addiction of over-consumption of alcohol and is highly prevalent in the US. There are high incidence rates in many other world regions. Roughly 61% of American adults drank in 2007, and 21% of current drinkers consumed five or more drinks at one point in the last year. There have also been 22,073 alcohol induced deaths in the United States in the past year, about 13,000 of which were related to liver disease. Alcoholism has many risk factors ingrained in North American culture, such as heredity, stress from competition or availability.\n\nThe Swine Flu (also known as H1N1) epidemic is a recent disease emerging in the early 21st century. In April 2009, during the early days of the outbreak, a molecular biologist named Dr. Henry Miller wrote in the \"Wall Street Journal\" about New York City high-school students. These students apparently brought the virus back from Mexico and infected their classmates. All six cases so far reported in Canada were connected directly or indirectly with travel to Mexico as well. Flu viruses can be directly transmitted (via droplets from sneezing or coughing) from pigs to people, and vice versa. These cross-species infections occur most commonly when people are close to large numbers of pigs, such as in barns, livestock exhibits at fairs, and slaughterhouses. The flu is transmissible from human to human, either directly or via contaminated surfaces.\"\n\nThere are many diseases that affect South America, but two major conditions are malaria and Hepatitis D.\nMalaria affects every country in South America except Uruguay, Chile, and The Falkland Islands. Elevation is a major factor in the areas where malaria is found. The disease is spread from person to person via mosquito bites. People are typically bitten by mosquitoes at dusk and dawn. Symptoms of this disorder are: high fever, chills, sweating, headaches, body aches, weakness, vomiting and diarrhea. If left untreated, new symptoms can occur; people that are infected may experience seizures, delirium and coma. Severe cases may end in death. Malaria can be cured, but the symptoms may not become noticeable until months later. There are three forms of medication that can cure Malaria. An infected person's accessibility to these drugs is dependent upon their access to medical care and their financial situation. Literature about Malaria treatment typically is focused toward people who are tourists. Most sources are not written with the native in mind.\nThe first sign of Hepatitis D was detected in 1978 when a strange and unrecognizable internuclear antigen was discovered during a liver biopsy of several Italians who suffered HBV infection. Scientists initially thought that it was an antigenic specificity of HBV, but they soon found that it was a protein from another disease altogether. They called it \"Hepatitis Delta Virus\" (HDV). This new virus was found to be defective. HDV needed HBV to act as a helper function in order for it to be detected. Normally Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood or any type of blood product. In South America Hepatitis D was found to be fatal. Scientists are still unsure in what way this disease was being transmitted throughout certain South American countries. Sexual contact and drug use are the most common means of transmission. HDV is still considered an unusual form of hepatitis. Agents of this virus resemble that of plant viroids. It is still hard to tell how many stereotypes exist because HDV is under the umbrella of HBV. HDV causes very high titers in the blood of people who are infected. Incubation of Hepatitis D typically lasts for thirty five days. Most often Hepatitis D is a co-infection with Hepatitis B or a super-infection with chronic hepatitis. In terms of super infections there are high mortality rates, ranging seventy to eighty percent; in contrast with co-infections which have a one to three percent mortality rate. There is little information with the ecology of Hepatitis D. Epidemics have been found in Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, and Brazil. People who are treated for Hepatitis B have been able to control Hepatitis D. People who have chronic HDB will continue to get HDV.\n\nAnother disease that affects South America is HIV and AIDS. In 2008 roughly two million people had HIV and AIDS. By the end of 2008 one hundred and seventy thousand people were infected with AIDS and HIV. Seventy seven thousand people died from this disease by the end of that year. Brazil has the most people that are affected with AIDS and HIV in South America. Forty-three percent of people in Brazil have HIV. In Brazil sixty percent of the inhabitants use drugs, are HIV positive, and are HIV positive because of their drug use. Usually this disease is transmitted by either drug use involving needles or unprotected sex. Sharing needles and being infected with HIV and AIDS is most common in Paraguay and Uruguay. South America is trying to get treatment to the thousands of people infected by this disease. Brazil is offering generic AIDS prescriptions that are much less expensive than the name brand drugs. One hundred and eighty-one thousand inhabitants in Brazil who were infected are being treated. That accounts for eighty percent of those who needed immediate help. This aid from the government has had positive results. Statistics show that there was a fifty percent decrease in mortality rates, approximately sixty to eighty percent decrease in morbidity rates and a seventy percent decrease in hospitalization of infected people.\n\nIn very remote areas of South America, traditional healers are the only forms of health care people have.\nIn north Aymara and south Mapuche, where the indigenous groups have the strongest voices, they still heavily use traditional medicine. The government in Chile has implemented an Indigenous Health System to help strengthen the health care system. Even with Chile's indigenous groups, Chile still has the best public health services in South America. They also have the lowest mortality rates in the area. Their health care policies are centered around family and community wellbeing by focusing on the strategies for prevention health strategies. Reports have shown an increase in mental health issues, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nSouth America's economy is developing rapidly and has a great deal of industries. The major industry in South America are agriculture. Other industries are fishing, handicrafts, and natural resources. Its trade and import-export market is continually thriving. In the past South American countries moved slowly in regards to economic development. South America began to build its economy ever since World War II. South America's largest economies are Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Columbia. Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina's economy are growing very rapidly.\n\n\n"}

It is the Polish term for \"de Zamość\" (Polish \"z Zamościa\"), the name they originally held as lords of Zamość. The family was influential in Polish politics for several centuries, and its members held various official titles, including those of Count and Countess.\n\nThe family traces its origins to the Łaźniński family. In the 15th century, Tomasz Łaźniński bought an estate in Stary (Old) Zamość. His sons Florian (died 1510) and Maciej assumed the name Zamoyski, and the family began to rise in prominence. Florian’s grandson Stanisław was the castellan of Chełm, and his son, Jan Zamoyski, arguably the most famous member of the family, became a chancellor, hetman, and founded the Zamoyski's Ordynat - a large estate that was a major source of the family's wealth. He was the 1st Ordynat of the Zamoyski Family Fee Tail. His son, Tomasz Zamoyski, the 2nd Ordynat, was also a chancellor in Poland. Many of their descendants held important positions within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, often that of a voivode.\n\nIn the 18th century, the 10th Ordynat, Andrzej Zamoyski, became the third chancellor of Poland in the family's history. He was one of the authors of a plan for general reform of the nation, known as Zamoyski Code. The family received the title of count from the Holy Roman Emperor in the late 18th century. Brothers Andrzej Artur Zamoyski and Władysław Stanisław Zamoyski, supported Polish movements aimed at regaining independence during the partitions period; Władysław was exiled after participating in the November Uprising, and Andrzej, in the aftermath of the January Uprising.\n\nAndrzej's grandson, Maurycy Zamoyski, was a Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Second Polish Republic for seven months in 1924.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1835106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835106", "title": "Feoffment", "text": "Feoffment\n\nIn the Middle Ages, especially under the European feudal system, feoffment or enfeoffment was the deed by which a person was given land in exchange for a pledge of service. This mechanism was later used to avoid restrictions on the passage of title in land by a system in which a landowner would give land to one person for the use of another. The common law of estates in land grew from this concept.\n\nIn English law, feoffment was a transfer of land or property that gave the new holder the right to sell it as well as the right to pass it on to his heirs as an inheritance. It was total relinquishment and transfer of all rights of ownership of an estate in land from one individual to another. In feudal England a feoffment could only be made of a fee (or \"fief\"), which is an estate in land, that is to say an ownership of rights over land, rather than ownership of the land itself, the only true owner of which was the monarch under his allodial title. Enfeoffment could be made of fees of various feudal tenures, such as fee-tail or fee-simple. The term \"feoffment\" derives from a conflation of \"fee\" with \"off\" (meaning \"away\"), i.e. it expresses the concept of alienation of the \"fee\", in the sense of a complete \"giving away\" of the ownership.\n\nThe medieval English law of property was based on the concept of transfering ownership by delivery: easy to do with a horse, but impossible with land, i.e. with immoveable property. Thus the conveyance (i.e. delivery) of land to the new tenant, known as the delivery of seisin, was generally effected on the land itself in a symbolic ceremony termed \"feoffment with [de]livery of seisin.\" In the ceremony, the parties would go to the land with witnesses \"and the transferor would then hand to the transferee a lump of soil or a twig from a tree – all the while intoning the appropriate words of grant, together with the magical words 'and his heirs' if the interest transferred was to be a potentially infinite one.\" A written deed (traditionally a document impressed with the signature and seal of the transferor and the signtatures of the witnesses), confirming the symbolic delivery, was customary -- and became mandatory after 1677. Gradually the delivery of this deed to the new owner replaced the symbolic act of delivering an object representing the land, such as a piece of the soil. The feoffee (transferee) was henceforth said to hold his property \"of\" or \"from\" the feoffor, in return for a specified service (money payments were not used until much later). What service was given depended on the exact form of feudal land tenure involved. Thus, for every parcel of land, during the feudal era there existed a historical unbroken chain of feoffees, in the form of overlords, ultimately springing from feoffments made by William the Conqueror himself in 1066 as the highest overlord of all.\n\nThis pattern of land-holding was the natural product of William the Conqueror claiming an allodial title to all the land of England following the Norman Conquest of 1066, and parcelling it out as large fees in the form of feudal baronies to his followers, who then in turn subinfeudated (i.e. sub-divided) the lands comprising their baronies into manors to be held from them by their own followers and knights (in return, originally, for military service).\n\nWhen the feoffee sub-enfeoffed his holding, for example when he created a new manor, he would become overlord to the person so enfeoffed, and a mesne lord (i.e. intermediate lord) within the longer historical chain of title. In modern English land law, the theory of such long historical chains of title still exists for every holding in fee simple, although for practical purposes it is not necessary at the time of conveyance to recite the descent of the fee from its creation. By the early 20th Century it had become traditional to show the chain of former owners for a minimum period of 15 years only, as occupation for 12 years now barred all prior claims. And the establishment, in 1925, of a national Land Registry (a voluntary public record of land ownership) obviated the need for recitals of descent for registered parcels.\n\nIn China and some other South East Asian countries, from the time of the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC) relatives and descendants of the ruling family were granted enfeoffments in return for pledging military service to the King or Emperor in times of war.\n\n\n"}

Similar to optical interferometers, atom interferometers measure the difference in phase between atomic matter waves along different paths. Atom interferometers have many uses in fundamental physics including measurements of the gravitational constant, the fine-structure constant, the universality of free fall, and have been proposed as a method to detect gravitational waves. They also have applied uses as accelerometers, rotation sensors, and gravity gradiometers.\n\nInterferometry inherently depends on the wave nature of the object. As pointed out by de Broglie in his PhD thesis, particles, including atoms, can behave like waves (the so-called wave–particle duality, according to the general framework of quantum mechanics). More and more high precision experiments now employ atom interferometers due to their short de Broglie wavelength. Some experiments are now even using molecules to obtain even shorter de Broglie wavelengths and to search for the limits of quantum mechanics. In many experiments with atoms, the roles of matter and light are reversed compared to the laser based interferometers, i.e. the beam splitter and mirrors are lasers while the source instead emits matter waves (the atoms).\n\nWhile the use of atoms offers easy access to higher frequencies (and thus accuracies) than light, atoms are affected much more strongly by gravity. In some apparatuses, the atoms are ejected upwards and the interferometry takes place while the atoms are in flight, or while falling in free flight. In other experiments gravitational effects by free acceleration are not negated; additional forces are used to compensate for gravity. While these guided systems in principle can provide arbitrary amounts of measurement time, their quantum coherence is still under discussion. Recent theoretical studies indicate that coherence is indeed preserved in the guided systems, but this has yet to be experimentally confirmed.\n\nThe early atom interferometers deployed slits or wires for the beam splitters and mirrors. Later systems, especially the guided ones, used light forces for splitting and reflecting of\nthe matter wave.\n\nThe separation of matter wave packets from complete atoms was first observed by Esterman and Stern in 1930, when a Na beam was diffracted off a surface of NaCl. The first modern atom interferometer reported was a Young's-type double slit experiment with metastable helium atoms and a microfabricated double slit by Carnal and Mlynek in 1991, and an interferometer using three microfabricated diffraction gratings and Na atoms in the group around Pritchard at MIT. Shortly afterwards, an optical version of Ramsey spectrometer typically used in atomic clocks was recognized also as an atom interferometer at the PTB in Braunschweig, Germany. The largest physical separation between the partial wave packets of atoms was achieved using laser cooling techniques and stimulated Raman transitions by S. Chu and coworkers in Stanford.. More recently atom interferometers have begun moving out of laboratory conditions and have begun to address a variety of applications in real word environments.\n\nThe first team to make a working model, Pritchard's, which included D.W. Keith, prompted Keith to leave atomic physics after achieving success, in part because one of the most obvious applications for atom interferometry was in highly accurate gyroscopes for submarines carrying ballistic missiles. AIGs (atomic interferometer gyroscopes) and ASGs (atomic spin gyroscopes) use atomic interferometer to sense rotation or in the latter case, uses atomic spin to sense rotation with both having compact size, high precision, and the possibility of being made on a chip-scale. \"AI gyros\" may compete, along with ASGs, with the established ring laser gyroscope, fiber optic gyroscope and hemispherical resonator gyroscope in future inertial guidance applications.\n\n\n"}

In their short history, the band toured both the United Kingdom, (in support of A) and the United States.\n\nIn 2008, the band reformed to play some live shows, including Soundwave in Australia, Rock Am Ring in Germany, Hove Festival in Norway, a headline tour and Download Festival in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn November 16, 2010 the band released the deluxe single for \"Shot After Shot\" on iTunes from the forthcoming record \"Pedals\", which was released March 8, 2011. Rival Schools released their third album \"Found\" on April 9, 2013.\n\nRival School's first release was based around the concept of a series of EPs where multiple groups would come together to form a single band. For this, they teamed up with former Far leadman, Jonah Matranga. The lone result of this experiment was titled \"Rival Schools United by Onelinedrawing,\" released on 24 July 2001 by Schreifels' Some Records. \n\nTheir full-length album, \"United by Fate\", was produced by the Grammy-nominated Luke Ebbin and released on 28 August 2001. Due to obligations from Schreifels' time with Quicksand, the album was released by Island Records. Two songs from the album saw release as singles: \"Used for Glue\" closely followed the album's release, with \"Good Things\" coming later. Both songs enjoyed heavy rotation on MTV in the US and UK.\n\nThe band went down when member Ian Love left the band in 2002. In between touring with the band, he'd formed [ \"Cardia\"] and eventually left to focus on them. Regardless, a second album was expected for Spring/Summer 2003, but never surfaced commercially (the master tapes, comprising 11 songs, were later leaked onto the Internet). The rest of the band parted ways in September 2003: Schreifels went on to form Walking Concert; Love recorded a self-titled solo album in 2006, released on Limekiln Records; Tolman went on play with Institute; and Siegler joined Nightmare of You and briefly provided percussion for Limp Bizkit.\n\nDespite the band's dissolution, rumours persisted that a new Rival Schools album would be released. This album would presumably be the never-released second LP, however other suggestions have been of an album of B-sides and unreleased songs or of an album of new material, performed by a reformed Rival Schools. Schreifels himself mentioned the likelihood of a new album, with it being mooted for late 2006. The album was mastered in 2012 and eventually released, titled \"Found\", on April 9, 2013, having been unofficially available in mp3 demo form.\n\nOn April 9, 2008 the German Rock am Ring & Rock im Park rock music festivals announced that Rival Schools would perform at the festival on June 8, 2008. The band also played the second stage of the Download Festival in Donington Park, UK on the same day Kiss headlined. The band advertised a 5 date UK tour in Kerrang! Magazine (7 May 2008), and set up an official Myspace page, on which Schreifels revealed the band were writing new material. New songs aired at the UK dates have included 'Big Waves', 'Paranoid Detective', 'On the Frey' and 'Sophia Lauren'. Rival Schools is played a small number of east coast US shows in November, prior to appearing at Fun Fun Fun Festival in Austin, TX in November, and then at the Soundwave festival in February 2009. On January 24, 2009 the band announced on their MySpace that they were entering the studio to start recording their as yet untitled new album. In August 2009, they played the UK Reading & Leeds festivals on the 'Lock Up' stage alongside Mad Caddies, The Bronx and Rise Against. Rival Schools also supported The Offspring at their UK shows.\n\nOn November 16, 2010 the band released the deluxe single for \"Shot After Shot\" on iTunes from the then forthcoming record \"Pedals\" \n\nOn March 8, 2011 \"Pedals\" was released on Photo Finish Records.

{"id": "1835277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835277", "title": "Slitheen", "text": "Slitheen\n\nThe Slitheen are a family of massive, bipedal extraterrestrials from the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" and are adversaries of the Ninth Doctor and later Sarah Jane Smith. The Slitheen are of the egg-laying calcium-based Raxacoricofallapatorian race native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, though many use \"Slitheen\" in referring to the race in general. Instinctive hunters trained to kill at a young age, Slitheen are a ruthless criminal sect whose main motivation is profit. They are also convicted on their home world, not willing to return to their planet due to a death sentence.\n\nThe Slitheen first appeared in the 2005 series episodes \"Aliens of London\" and \"World War Three\", and subsequently recur in later episodes of both \"Doctor Who\" and spin-off series \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\".\n\nAdult Slitheen are tall, rather fat with long forearms, powerful claws, and infantile face. They do not appear to have eyelids, but have a nictitating membrane. They have a highly developed sense of smell, able to track a single target across a few city blocks, smell adrenaline and hormones in people, and can sense if one of their own dies. Female Raxacoricofallapatorians can produce poisons within their bodies to use against their enemies. Known methods of delivery include a poisoned dart that is formed in the finger and then fired, and exhalation of poisoned breath. Members of the Slitheen family have green skin, though there is variation in the skin tone of other Raxacoricofallapatorian families. In \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" episode \"The Gift\", members of the Slitheen-Blathereen family group are seen to have orange skin.\n\nThe Slitheen disguise themselves by fitting into the skins of their victims, using compression fields created by a collar worn around their necks to squeeze their huge size into a slightly smaller space. Initially the compression ratio was limited, so the disguises tended to be obese people. This issue was overcome by new technology by the time of \"The Lost Boy\", in which the skins of thinner people were used (by the time of \"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\" short people could also be used). The exchange of gases that compression entails also builds up within the acquired skin, causing very loud flatulence in humans (the expelled gas smells like bad breath, which the Doctor noted was a form of calcium decay—though, in reality, bacteria that cause tooth decay are different from those that cause bad breath). This side-effect is also overcome by the newer technology in \"The Lost Boy\".\n\nWhen the Slitheen are in their skin suits they break wind loudly; they call this the gas exchange.\nThis can also be caused by over-eating. In \"The Gift\", Sarah Jane and the gang destroy their source of food, a plant called Rackweed, which is native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, The Rackweed, when digested, sits in their stomach. Using the audio of every audio producing device in the vicinity, Mr Smith triggers a sound in the attic. This causes the Slitheen to pass gas and, through the subsequent vibration, cause their stomach's to explode. Clyde then states that they \"farted themselves to death.\"\n\nRaxacoricofallapatorians are vulnerable to acetic acid, which reacts explosively—and fatally—with their bodies, making Slitheen allergic to vinegar, ketchup and Coca-Cola. One of the Raxacoricofallapatorian methods of execution is the lowering of the condemned into a cauldron of acetic acid, which is then heated to boiling. The acidity of the solution is formulated to dissolve the skin, allowing the internal organs to drop into the liquid while the condemned is still alive, reducing them to \"soup\" in a slow and painful death. In \"World War Three\", when a single Slitheen was electrocuted, the effects were transmitted to other Slitheen, even those across the city. Another weakness is shown in an episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures when \"The gang\" use sound to foil the slitheen plot.\n\nWhen they first appeared in \"Aliens of London\" (set in 2006), the Pasameer-Day branch of the Slitheen had been in Great Britain for some time, having infiltrated various levels of British society, from community leaders and military personnel to mid-level politicians and government officials. Their intent was to instigate World War III and sell the radioactive remains of Earth to a depressed galactic economy as fuel for interstellar spacecraft. They staged the crash landing of an alien spaceship in central London, setting up a cybernetically augmented pig as an \"extraterrestrial\" body.\n\nWith the world in a state of heightened alert and panic, and with their commander Jocrassa assuming the role of Acting Prime Minister, they persuaded the United Nations to allow the United Kingdom to use its nuclear arsenal against the alien \"massive weapons of destruction\". Before the Slitheen could receive the launch codes, the Ninth Doctor arranged for a Harpoon missile to demolish 10 Downing Street, ending the scheme and killing all but one of them who managed to escape through an emergency teleport.\n\nBlon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day Slitheen, who had assumed the identity of Margaret Blaine of MI5, survived and appeared in the episode \"Boom Town\". In the intervening six months, \"Blaine\" was elected as Lord Mayor of Cardiff and planned to leave Earth by using the energy from a new nuclear power station to interact with the Cardiff Rift, unconcerned that the planet would be destroyed in the process. Blon was stopped by the Doctor and his companions, and on exposure to the \"heart\" of the TARDIS, regressed to an egg. The Doctor took the egg to the hatcheries on Raxacoricofallapatorius so she could be given a second chance at life.\n\nSome years after the events of \"World War Three\", in \"Revenge of the Slitheen\" (set in either 2008 or 2009) another group of Slitheen infiltrated a construction company with plans to turn off the Sun and destroy Earth by draining the world's energy to avenge the deaths of the Pasameer-Days. It is mentioned that the Judoon have begun to force out the Slitheen, and the various other families have been working against them. The families Blathereen and Hostrazeen are mentioned as part of the Raxacoricofallapatorian ruling bodies, the Senate and the Grand Council. After Commander Glune was killed by Maria Jackson, Luke Smith was able to trick the Slitheen into resetting their machinery, which then malfunctioned and exploded. Two of the remaining Slitheen were killed, and the others escaped, including Korst, the first child Slitheen to appear.\n\nThe Slitheen returned in \"The Lost Boy\" where, using the newer compression technology, two Slitheen named Dax and Bloorm posed as Luke's 'real' parents Jay and Heidi Stafford. They were under the command of Korst from \"Revenge of the Slitheen\", who planned to avenge the deaths of his family. Another shorter adult Slitheen appeared in the 2009 \"From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love\", masquerading as a galactic diplomat in an attempt to steal Sarah Jane's robot dog K-9.\n\nThe Slitheen appeared in the New Series Adventures novel \"The Monsters Inside\" by Stephen Cole. When the Ninth Doctor and Rose are arrested in the Justicia System in the year 2501, the Doctor shares a cell with Dram Fel-Fotch and Ecktosca Fel-Fotch Happen-Bar Slitheen, who claim that after the Earth incident, the remnants of the family went bankrupt and had become historians. The Slitheen had not actually given up business, and were in conflict with a more influential family, the Blathereen. When the Doctor and Rose defeat an attempted Blathereen takeover of the system, the Slitheen are pleased to see they can once again become the profit-holders of their race. The Blathereen were mentioned again in the Sarah Jane adventures episode \"Revenge of the Slitheen\".\n\nIn the Series 3 finale of \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", \"The Gift\", a pair of Slitheen-Blathereen from an intermarried line of the two families attempted to overrun Earth with Rakweed, a plant native to Raxacoricofallapatorius and used as an addictive vegetable.\n\nIn \"Dalek\", a stuffed Raxacoricofallapatorian arm was among a collection of alien artifacts owned by American billionaire Henry van Statten in the year 2012.\n\nRose mentioned the Slitheen Parliament of Raxacoricofallapatorius in \"The Christmas Invasion\" (though her impromptu speech was a pastiche of phrases she had picked up on her travels with the Doctor).

The Slitheen space ship from \"Aliens of London\" was also seen in a flashback in the same episode.\n\nA Slitheen appears briefly in the Tenth Doctor novel \"The Nightmare of Black Island\" by Mike Tucker, created from Rose's memories, along with a Dalek and the Nestene Consciousness. The Slitheen are also briefly referenced by the Doctor in the same novel while speaking to a member of the Cynrog about hiding under human-like skinsuits.

The Guardians first appear in \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" #18 (Jan. 1969). The initial roster consisted of Vance Astro, Martinex T'Naga, Captain Charlie-27, and Yondu Udonta. Later members included Stakar Ogord, Aleta Ogord, and Nikki.\n\nRoy Thomas recounted,\n\nThe team first appeared in the partial reprint title \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" with issue #18 (Jan. 1969), written by Arnold Drake and penciled by Gene Colan. Despite strong sales on this issue, the Guardians of the Galaxy would not appear again for over five years, in \"Marvel Two-In-One\" #4–5 (July–Sept. 1974). The story's writer, Steve Gerber, liked the team enough to use them again in \"Giant Size Defenders\" #5 and \"Defenders\" #26–29 (July–Nov. 1975). In each case, other heroes such as Captain America, the Thing, and the Defenders aid them in their war against the alien Badoon, necessitating the liberal use of time travel in these stories.\n\nThe Guardians were finally given their own series, \"Marvel Presents\", starting with issue #3 (Feb. 1976). Steve Gerber, still handling the writing chores, reflected, \"Most of the stories I was scripting were set in the present. I wanted to do something that combined the standard superhero elements with something a little different, so that I could give my imagination a bit more play. We had Dave Cockrum redesign the costumes, we created a new starship for them to pilot, and we revised the premise of the strip, so that they were no longer fighting the Badoon on Earth, and sent them off among the stars.\" Gerber left the series after seven issues, leaving Roger Stern to take over with \"Marvel Presents\" #10. The series was cancelled shortly afterwards due to poor sales, with the final issue being #12 (August 1977). This was followed by a series of appearances in \"Thor Annual\" #6 (1977), \"The Avengers\" #167–177 (Jan.–Nov. 1978) and #181 (March 1979), \"Ms. Marvel\" #23, \"Marvel Team-Up\" #86 (Oct. 1979), and \"Marvel Two-in-One\" #61–63 & #69 (Nov. 1980). \"Marvel Two-in-One\" #69 drastically changed the Guardians of the Galaxy story; due to changes made to the past of one of the members, the future which the Guardians of the Galaxy come from and the mainstream Marvel Universe are permanently separated, becoming alternate timelines to each other. After this, the Guardians of the Galaxy were absent from published stories for over a decade.\n\nIn 1989, Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco decided to revive the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to cash in on the soaring popularity of the TV series \"\". DeFalco worked out a series concept using a new team of Guardians, but when he saw a series proposal for the original team that Jim Valentino had coincidentally been working on at the same time, he green lit Valentino's idea instead. The Guardians' first self-titled comic launched in June 1990 and ran for 62 issues. This series was initially written and illustrated by Valentino, who deliberately gave it an action-oriented, \"fun\" feel that stood out from the typical \"grim 'n' gritty\" comics of the 1990s. Though Valentino had plotted the series ahead as far as issue #50, his run was cut short when he co-founded Image Comics. Having taken on two new series and the foundation of a publication company, Valentino asked editor Craig Anderson if he could switch to just writing \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", and in response Anderson dismissed him from the series.\n\nWith issue #29 (Oct. 1992) Michael Gallagher commenced writing the title, and continued until its cancellation with issue #62 (July 1995). According to Kevin West, who became the penciller with issue #30 (Nov. 1992), he and Gallagher worked together closely on the series, employing the Marvel method of creation, and soon became good friends. A spin-off four-issue miniseries, \"Galactic Guardians\" (July–Oct. 1994), also by Gallagher and West, appeared during this time. West explained why he did not draw the final issue of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\": \"When I heard we were getting the hook, I naturally started looking for a new job. I ended up at Malibu. There was a hold-up getting the \"Guardians\" plot finished so by the time I got it, I had to pass because I had a Malibu deadline to meet. Arrgh. Despite any minor qualms I had, I really did enjoy working on the series.\"\n\nA second volume was published in May 2008, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The title, set in a different timeline, features a new team, drawn from participants in the \"\" storyline. The 1969 team made guest appearances in #12–17 and #25.\n\nA new ongoing series starring the original Guardians, titled \"Guardians 3000\" and written by Abnett, launched in 2014.\n\nThe Guardians are active in the 31st century in an alternative time-line of the Marvel Universe known as Earth-691. The original members of the team include Major Vance Astro (later known as Major Victory), an astronaut from 20th century Earth who spends a thousand years travelling to Alpha Centauri in suspended animation. He is also the future alternative universe counterpart of Vance Astrovik, the hero known as Justice.\n\nOther original team members are Martinex T'Naga, a crystalline being from Pluto; Captain Charlie-27, a soldier from Jupiter; and Yondu Udonta, a blue-skinned \"noble savage\" from Centauri-IV (the fourth planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri B). Each is apparently the last of their kind and they are forced to unite as a team against the actions of the Badoon, an alien race which attempts to conquer Earth's Solar System.\n\nDuring the course of the war against the Badoon, the team gains three more members—the mysterious husband and wife duo, Starhawk and Aleta, as well as Nikki, a genetically engineered young girl from Mercury seeking excitement in her life—and travel back in time, where they encounter several of the heroes of 20th century Earth, including Captain America and the Thing.\n\nThe guardians eventually defeat the Badoon, but soon find themselves facing a new foe called Korvac, who was in part a creation of the Badoon. After teaming with the thunder god Thor to defeat Korvac in the 31st century, the guardians then follow Korvac to 20th century mainstream Earth, where together with the Avengers they fight a final battle.\n\nThe guardians reappear years later and have a series of adventures in their future, with several others eventually joining the team: the Inhuman Talon, the Skrull , the second Yellowjacket (alias Rita DeMara of the 20th century), and an aged Simon Williams (now called Hollywood, Man of Wonder).\n\nWanting to expand the guardians to a multiple-team organization, Martinex eventually leaves to look for additional members for a second unit, the Galactic Guardians.\n\nDuring their second mission, the team that was to become the Earth-616 incarnation of the guardians discover a time-displaced Vance Astro in a block of ice floating in space. It is his introduction as \"Major Victory of the Guardians of the Galaxy\" that inspires the team to take up the name. In issues #7 and #16 of the series, it was revealed a great \"error\" in the present day has caused the future to be destroyed; Starhawk is constantly trying to prevent it by time travel, causing the future (and the Guardians) to be altered. Only Starhawk, who is changed with each reboot but is \"one who knows\" about the changes, realizes anything is different, but each change still ends in a cataclysm. In issue 17, the universe of the Guardians' future had been taken over by the alien race called the Badoon, and only a small portion remained undestroyed. The Guardians sent a warning to the present day, though at the cost of the end of their own universe.\n\nThe Vance Astro of the modern-day Guardians is revealed to be a Major Victory from one of these altered futures, rather than the original. A second alternate Vance Astro appears in #17.\n\nIn #18, a third version of the Guardians' future was shown: this time led by Killraven against the Martians.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was Grand Princess consort of Moscow as the second wife of Grand Prince Vasili III and regent of Russia for 5 years (1533–38). She was the mother of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.\n\nElena was a daughter of Prince Vasili Lvovich Glinsky, belonging to a Lipka Tatar clan claiming descent from the Mongol ruler Mamai (1335-1380), and Serb Princess Ana Jakšić. It is to her powerful uncle, Prince Mikhail Glinsky, that the family owed its distinction. In 1525, Vasili III resolved to divorce his barren wife, Solomoniya Saburova, and marry Elena. According to the chronicles, he chose Elena \"because of the beauty of her face and her young age.\" They were married on 21 January 1526.\n\nDespite strong opposition from the Russian Orthodox Church, the divorce was effected, and Elena gave birth to Ivan (future Ivan IV the Terrible) in 1530 and Yuri (future prince of Uglich) in 1532. It was later rumoured, that Elena brought witches from Finland and people of the Sami to help her conceive by the help of magic On his deathbed, Vasili III transferred his powers to Elena Glinskaya until his oldest son Ivan, who was only three at the time, was mature enough to rule the country. The chronicles of those times do not provide any more or less precise information on Elena's legal status after Vasili's death. All that is known is that it could be defined as regency and that the boyars had to report to her. That is why the time between Vasili's death on 3 December 1533 and her own demise in 1538 is called the reign of Elena.\n\nElena Glinskaya challenged the claims of her brothers-in-law, Yury Ivanovich and Andrey of Staritsa. The struggle ended with their incarceration in 1534 and 1537, respectively. Elena's reign is also known for conflicts inside the government caused by her close association with a handsome young boyar named Ivan Feodorovich Ovchina-Telepnev-Obolensky and Metropolitan Daniel. In 1535, Elena carried out a currency reform that introduced a unified monetary system in the state. In foreign affairs, Glinskaya succeeded in signing an armistice with Lithuania in 1536, while simultaneously neutralizing Sweden. She had a new defensive wall constructed around Moscow, invited settlers from Lithuania, bought Russian prisoners free and instigated measures to protect travellers against street bandits. She is recorded as having visited several convents\n\nElena died in 1538 at a relatively young age. Her son's governess, Agrippina Fedorovna Chelyadnina was arrested in connection with Glinskaya's death. Some historians believe that she was poisoned by the Shuiskys, who usurped power after her death. Recent studies of her remains tend to support the thesis that Elena was poisoned.\n"}

A shortstop, Scott played in Major League Baseball for 12 seasons as a member of the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Washington Senators, Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds, from 1914 through 1926. Scott batted and threw right-handed.\n\nScott served as captain of both the Red Sox and Yankees, who have become fierce rivals. He compiled a lifetime batting average of .249, hitting 20 home runs with 551 runs batted in in 1,654 games. He led American League shortstops in fielding percentage seven straight seasons (1916–22) and appeared in 1,307 consecutive games from June 20, 1916, through May 6, 1925, setting a record later broken by Lou Gehrig. , it is still the third-longest streak in history.\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Scott became a professional bowler and owned bowling alleys. He died in Fort Wayne, Indiana, at the age of 67. He was posthumously inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame and Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.\n\nScott was born in Bluffton, Indiana. He had two brothers and a sister. His father, Lewis, had moved to Bluffton from Warren, Indiana, shortly before Everett's birth. Lewis' brother, Frame, had been a baseball player when he was younger.\n\nScott attended Bluffton High School, where he played for the school's baseball and basketball teams. He graduated in 1909. Scott married his high school sweetheart, Gladys Watt, in 1912.\n\nAfter graduating from Bluffton, Scott made his professional baseball debut in Minor League Baseball with the Kokomo Wild Cats of the Class D Northern State of Indiana League in 1909. He moved to the Fairmont Champions of the Class D Pennsylvania–West Virginia League for the remainder of the 1909 season. He began the 1910 season with Fairmont, and completed the season with Kokomo. He joined the Youngstown Steelmen of the Class C Ohio–Pennsylvania League in 1911, and remained with them in 1912, when they played in the Class B Central League.\n\nJimmy McAleer, a native of Youngstown and minority owner of the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL), noticed Scott playing for the Steelmen. On McAleer's suggestion, the Red Sox purchased Scott from Youngstown after the 1912 season, and optioned him to the St. Paul Saints of the Class AA American Association. Towards the end of the 1913 season, the Red Sox recalled Scott.\n\nBill Phillips, manager of the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the outlaw Federal League, attempted to convince Scott to jump from the AL after the 1913 season by offering Scott a $4,000 contract ($ today). Scott remained with the Red Sox, signing a contract for $2,500 ($ today) for the 1914 season.\n\nScott made his major league debut on April 14, 1914 for the Red Sox, and had a .239 batting average with strong fielding as a rookie. His batting average dropped to .201 in the 1915 season. The Red Sox won the AL pennant, and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1915 World Series. Scott had one hit in 18 at bats during the series.\n\nOn June 20, 1916, Scott began a consecutive games played streak. Scott batted .232 in the 1916 season and led all AL shortstops in fielding percentage. In the 1916 World Series, the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins. Scott had two hits in 16 at bats, and Wilbert Robinson of the Robins nicknamed Scott \"Trolley Wire\" due to his accurate throws.\nAfter a contract dispute, when Scott refused a pay cut from the Red Sox, Scott signed a contract for the 1918 season. He batted .241 in 1917, while leading AL shortstops in fielding percentage and defensive games played, but the Red Sox did not win the pennant. Scott batted .221 in the 1918 season, while leading AL shortstops in fielding percentage for the third consecutive season, as the Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. In April 1919, Scott signed a three-year contract with the Red Sox. Scott led AL shortstops in fielding percentage for the fourth consecutive season in 1919, and batted .278, the highest average of his career.\n\nScott broke George Pinkney's MLB consecutive games played streak of 577 on April 26, 1920. He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage. The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous captain, Harry Hooper, was traded to the Chicago White Sox. During spring training in 1921, Scott dealt with leg cramp that threatened his playing streak, but he was able to continue playing. Scott had 62 runs batted in on the season, and stated that it was his goal to play in 1,000 consecutive games.\n\nAfter the 1921 season, the Red Sox traded Scott with Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones to the New York Yankees for Rip Collins, Roger Peckinpaugh, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Del Pratt succeeded Scott as captain of the Red Sox.\n\nAfter Peckinpaugh, the captain of the Yankees, was traded, Babe Ruth was named the new team captain. Ruth was suspended in May 1922 and Scott was named captain in Ruth's place. Scott remained the Yankees' captain through 1925.\n\nScott played with the Yankees in the 1922 World Series. He entered the 1923 season 14 games shy of his goal of 1,000 consecutive games played, but sprained his ankle during spring training. He played on Opening Day at the newly opened Yankee Stadium, recording the first assist in the stadium's history. He played his 1,000th consecutive MLB game on May 2, 1923. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby presented Scott with a gold medal during a pregame ceremony. Scott broke Perry Lipe's professional baseball record for consecutive games played of 1,127 on September 14, 1923. By the following offseason, manager Miller Huggins began to consider ending Scott's streak. Huggins benched Scott on May 6, 1925 in favor of Pee Wee Wanninger, ending his record consecutive games played streak at 1,307.\n\nThe Washington Senators selected Scott off waivers from the New York Yankees in June 1925, paying the Yankees the waiver price of $4,000 ($ today). With the Senators, Scott served as Peckinpaugh's backup. The Senators reached the 1925 World Series, but lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates; Scott did not appear in the series.\n\nThough it was reported that Scott would retire to manage his business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Chicago White Sox signed Scott in February 1926. The Cincinnati Reds purchased Scott from the White Sox in July 1926. He played in four games for the Reds.\n\nScott signed with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League for the 1927 season, receiving his unconditionally release on August 4. He signed with the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association in August, and played in 33 games for them. Toledo released him after the season. Scott played with the Reading Keystones of the International League in 1928, batting .315. Scott returned to the Keystones in 1929, but received his release in July 1929 after 62 games, due to the team's disappointing play.\n\nScott was an avid bowler, and he competed in ten-pin bowling events sanctioned by the American Bowling Congress. He bowled against professional Hank Marino in 1931, though he lost. Scott also owned bowling alleys in Fort Wayne. He wrote a children’s book, called \"Third Base Thatcher\", that was published in 1928.\n\nLou Gehrig, a former teammate of Scott's on the Yankees, surpassed Scott's record of consecutive games played in August 1933 in a game against the St. Louis Browns. Gehrig's streak began in 1925, by pinch hitting for Wanninger, the same season Scott's streak ended. Scott attended the game at Sportsman's Park as a special guest of the Browns.\n\nScott died in Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana at age 67. He was posthumously inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986 and the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2008. \"The News-Sentinel\" named Scott the fourth-best athlete from Northeastern Indiana of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1835316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835316", "title": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society", "text": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n\nPhilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society is a scientific journal published by the Royal Society. In its earliest days, it was a private venture of the Royal Society's secretary. It was established in 1665, making it the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science, and therefore also the world's longest-running scientific journal. It became an official society publication in 1752. The use of the word \"philosophical\" in the title refers to natural philosophy, which was the equivalent of what would now be generally called \"science\".\n\nIn 1887 the journal expanded and divided into two separate publications, one serving the physical sciences (\"\") and the other focusing on the life sciences (\"\"). Both journals now publish themed issues and issues resulting from papers presented at the Discussion Meetings of the Royal Society. Primary research articles are published in the sister journals \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\", \"Biology Letters\", \"Journal of the Royal Society Interface\", and \"Interface Focus\".\n\nThe first issue, published in London on 6 March 1665, was edited and published by the Society's first secretary, Henry Oldenburg, four-and-a-half years after the Royal Society was founded. The full title of the journal, as given by Oldenburg, was \"Philosophical Transactions, Giving some Account of the present Undertakings, Studies, and Labours of the Ingenious in many considerable parts of the World\". The society's council minutes dated 1 March 1664 (in the Old Style calendar; equivalent to 11 March 1665 in the modern New Style calendar) ordered that \"the Philosophical Transactions, to be composed by Mr Oldenburg, be printed the first Monday of every month, if he have sufficient matter for it, and that that tract be licensed by the Council of this Society, being first revised by some Members of the same\". Oldenburg published the journal at his own personal expense and seems to have entered into an agreement with the society's council allowing him to keep any resulting profits. He was to be disappointed, however, since the journal performed poorly from a financial point of view during his lifetime, just about covering the rent on his house in Piccadilly. Oldenburg put out 136 issues of the \"Transactions\" before his death in 1677.\n\nThe familiar functions of the scientific journal—registration (date stamping and provenance), certification (peer review), dissemination and archiving—were introduced at inception by \"Philosophical Transactions\". The beginnings of these ideas can be traced in a series of letters from Oldenburg to Robert Boyle:\n\n\nThe printed journal replaced much of Oldenburg's letter-writing to correspondents, at least on scientific matters, and as such can be seen as a labour-saving device. Oldenburg also described his journal as \"one of these philosophical commonplace books\", indicating his intention to produce a collective notebook between scientists.\n\nIssue 1 contained such articles as: an account of the improvement of optic glasses; the first report on the Great Red Spot of Jupiter; a prediction on the motion of a recent comet (probably an Oort cloud object); a review of Robert Boyle's \"Experimental History of Cold\"; Robert Boyle's own report of a deformed calf; \"A report of a peculiar lead-ore from Germany, and the use thereof\"; \"Of an Hungarian Bolus, of the Same Effect with the Bolus Armenus\"; \"Of the New American Whale-Fishing about the Bermudas\", and \"A Narrative Concerning the Success of Pendulum-Watches at Sea for the Longitudes\". The final article of the issue concerned \"The Character, Lately Published beyond the Seas, of an Eminent Person, not Long Since Dead at Tholouse, Where He Was a Councellor of Parliament\". The eminent person in question was Pierre de Fermat, although the issue failed to mention his last theorem.\n\nOldenburg referred to himself as the \"compiler\" and sometimes \"Author\" of the \"Transactions\", and always claimed that the journal was entirely his sole enterprise—although with the Society's imprimatur and containing reports on experiments carried out and initially communicated by of many of its Fellows, many readers saw the journal as an official organ of the Society. It has been argued that Oldenburg benefitted from this ambiguity, retaining both real and perceived independence (giving the publication an air of authenticity) and the prospect of monetary gain, while simultaneously enjoying the credibility afforded by the association. The Society also enjoyed the benefits of ambiguity: it was able to communicate advances in natural philosophy, undertaken largely in its own name, without the worry that it was directly responsible for its content. In the aftermath of the Interregnum, the potential for censorship was very real. Certainly the tone of the early volumes was set by Oldenburg, who often related things he was told by his contacts, translated letters and manuscripts from other languages, and reviewed books, always being sure to indicate the provenance of his material and even to use this to impress the reader.\n\nBy reporting ongoing and often unfinished scientific work that may otherwise have not been reported, the journal had a central function of being a scientific news service. At the time of \"Philosophical Transactions\"' foundation, print was heavily regulated, and there was no such thing as a free press. In fact, the first English newspaper, \"The London Gazette\" (which was an official organ of government and therefore seen as sanitized), did not appear until after \"Philosophical Transactions\" in the same year.\n\nOldenburg's compulsive letter writing to foreign correspondents led to him being suspected of being a spy for the Dutch and interned in the Tower of London in 1667. A rival took the opportunity to publish a pirate issue of \"Philosophical Transactions\", with the pretense of it being Issue 27. Oldenburg repudiated the issue by publishing the real 27 upon his release.\n\nUpon Oldenburg's death, following a brief hiatus, the position of Editor was passed down through successive secretaries of the Society as an unofficial responsibility and at their own expense. Robert Hooke changed the name of the journal to \"Philosophical Collections\" in 1679—a name that remained until 1682, when it changed back. The position of editor was sometimes held jointly and included William Musgrave (Nos 167 to 178) and Robert Plot (Nos 144 to 178).\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, the most notable editors, besides Oldenburg, were Hans Sloane, James Jurin and Cromwell Mortimer. In virtually all cases the journal was edited by the serving secretary of the society (and occasionally by both secretaries working in tandem). These editor-secretaries carried the financial burden of publishing the \"Philosophical Transactions\". By the early 1750s, the \"Philosophical Transactions\" came under attack, most prominently by John Hill, an actor, apothecary, and naturalist. Hill published three works in two years, ridiculing the Royal Society and the \"Philosophical Transactions\". The Society was quick to point out that it was not officially responsible for the journal. Yet, in 1752 the Society took over the \"Philosophical Transactions\". The journal would henceforth be published \"for the sole use and benefit of this Society\"; it would be financially carried by the members' subscriptions; and it would be edited by the Committee of Papers.\n\nAfter the takeover of the journal by the Royal Society, management decisions including negotiating with printers and booksellers, were still the task of one of the Secretaries—but editorial control was exercised through the Committee of Papers. The Committee mostly based its judgements on which papers to publish and which to decline on the 300 to 500-word abstracts of papers read during its weekly meetings. But the members could, if they desired, consult the original paper in full. Once the decision to print had been taken, the paper appeared in the volume for that year. It would feature the author's name, the name of the Fellow who had communicated the paper to the Society, and the date on which it was read. The Royal Society covered paper, engraving and printing costs. The Society found the journal to be a money-losing proposition: it cost, on average, upwards of £300 annually to produce, of which they seldom recouped more than £150. Because two-fifths of the copies were distributed for free to the journal's natural market, sales were generally slow, and although back issues sold out gradually it would usually be ten years or more before there were fewer than 100 left of any given print run.\n\nDuring the Presidency of Joseph Banks the work of the Committee of Papers continued fairly efficiently, with the President himself in frequent attendance. There was a number of ways in which the President and Secretaries could bypass or subvert the Royal Society's publishing procedures. Papers could be prevented from reaching the Committee by not allowing them to be read in the first place. Also—though papers were rarely subjected to formal review—there is evidence of editorial intervention, with Banks himself or a trusted deputy proposing cuts or emendations to particular contributions. Publishing in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" carried a high degree of prestige and Banks himself attributed an attempt to unseat him, relatively early in his Presidency, to the envy of authors whose papers had been rejected from the journal.\n\n\"Transactions\" continued steadily through the turn of the century and into the 1820s. In the late 1820s and early 1830s, a movement to reform the Royal Society rose. The reformers felt that the scientific character of the Society had been undermined by the admission of too many gentleman dilettantes under Banks. In proposing a more limited membership, to protect the Society's reputation, they also argued for systematic, expert evaluation of papers for \"Transactions\" by named referees.\n\nSectional Committees, each with responsibility for a particular group of disciplines, were initially set up in the 1830s to adjudicate the award of George IV's Royal Medals. But individual members of these committees were soon put to work reporting on and evaluating papers submitted to the Royal Society. These evaluations began to be used as the basis of recommendations to the Committee of Papers, who would then rubber-stamp decisions made by the Sectional Committees. Despite its flaws—it was inconsistent in its application and not free of abuses—this system remained at the heart of the Society's procedures for publishing until 1847, when the Sectional Committees were dissolved. However, the practice of sending most papers out for review remained.\n\nDuring the 1850s, the cost of the \"Transactions\" to the Society was increasing again (and would keep doing so for the rest of the century); illustrations were always the largest outgoing. Illustrations had been a natural and essential aspect of the scientific periodical since the later seventeenth century. Engravings (cut into metal plates) were used for detailed illustrations, particularly where realism was required; while wood-cuts (and, from the early nineteenth century, wood-engravings) were used for diagrams, as they could be easily combined with letterpress.\n\nBy the mid-1850s, the \"Philosophical Transactions\" was seen as a drain on the Society's finances and the treasurer, Edward Sabine, urged the Committee of Papers to restrict the length and number of papers published in the journal. In 1852, for example, the amount expended on the \"Transactions\" was £1094, but only £276 of this was offset by sales income. Sabine felt this was more than the Society could comfortably sustain. The print run of the journal was 1000 copies. Around 500 of these went to the fellowship, in return for their membership dues, and since authors now received up to 150 off-prints for free, to circulate through their personal networks, the demand for the \"Transactions\" through the book trade must have been limited. The concerns with cost eventually led to a change in printer in 1877 from Taylor & Francis to Harrison & Sons—the latter was a larger commercial printer, able to offer the Society a more financially viable contract, although it was less experienced in printing scientific works.\nWhile expenditure was a worry for the Treasurer, as Secretary (from 1854), George Gabriel Stokes was preoccupied with the actual content of the \"Transactions\" and his extensive correspondence with authors over his thirty-one-years as Secretary took up most of his time beyond his duties as Lucasian Professor at Cambridge. Stokes was paramount in establishing a more formalized refereeing process at the Royal Society. It was not until Stokes's Presidency ended, in 1890, that his influence over the journal diminished. The introduction of fixed terms for Society officers precluded subsequent editors from taking on Stokes's mantle, and meant that the Society operated its editorial practices more collectively than it had done since the mechanisms for it were established in 1752.\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, the procedure of getting a paper published in the \"Transactions\" still relied on the reading of papers by a Fellow. Many papers were sent immediately for printing in abstract form in \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\". But those which were being considered for printing in full in \"Transactions\" were usually sent to two referees for comment before the final decision was made by the Committee of Papers. During Stokes's time, authors were given the opportunity to discuss their paper at length with him before, during and after its official submission to the Committee of Papers.\n\nIn 1887, the \"Transactions\" split into series \"A\" and \"B\", dealing with the physical and biological sciences respectively. In 1897, the model of collective responsibility for the editing of the \"Transactions\" was emphasized by the re-establishment of the Sectional Committees. The six sectional committees covered mathematics, botany, zoology, physiology, geology, and (together) chemistry and physics, and were composed of Fellows of the Society with relevant expertise. The Sectional Committees took on the task of managing the refereeing process after papers had been read before the Society. Referees were usually Fellows, except in a small number of cases where the topic was beyond the knowledge of the fellowship (or at least, of those willing to referee). The Sectional Committees communicated referee reports to authors; and sent reports to the Committee of Papers for final sanction. The Sectional Committees were intended to reduce the burden on the Secretaries and Council. Consequently, the Secretary in the 1890s, Arthur Rucker, no longer coordinated the refereeing of papers, nor did he generally correspond extensively with authors about their papers as Stokes had done. However, he continued to be the first port of call for authors submitting papers.\n\nAuthors were increasingly expected to submit manuscripts in a standardized format and style. From 1896, they were encouraged to submit typed papers on foolscap-folio-sized paper to lighten the work of getting papers ready for printing, and to reduce the chance of error in the process. A publishable paper now had to present its information in an appropriate manner, as well as being of remarkable scientific interest. For a brief period between 1907 and 1914, authors were under even more pressure to conform to the society's expectations, due to a decision to discuss cost estimates of candidate papers alongside referees' reports. The committees could require authors to reduce the number of illustrations or tables or, indeed, the overall length of the paper, as a condition of acceptance. It was hoped that this policy would reduce the still-rising costs of production, which had reached £1747 in 1906; but the effect appears to have been negligible, and the cost estimates ceased to be routine practice after 1914.\n\nIt was only after the Second World War that the Society's concerns about the cost of its journals were finally allayed. There had been a one-off surplus in 1932, but it was only from 1948 that the \"Transactions\" began regularly to end the year in surplus. That year, despite a three-fold increase in production costs (it was a bumper year for papers), there was a surplus of almost £400. Part of the post-war financial success of the \"Transactions\" was due to the rising subscriptions received, and a growing number of subscriptions from British and international institutions, including universities, industry, and government; this was at the same time as private subscriptions, outside of fellows, were non-existent. By the early 1970s, institutional subscription was the main channel of income from publication sales for the society. In 1970–1971, 43,760 copies of \"Transactions\" were sold, of which casual purchasers accounted for only 2070 copies.\n\nAll of the Society's publications now had a substantial international circulation; in 1973, for example, just 11% of institutional subscriptions were from the United Kingdom; 50% were from the United States. Contributions, however, were still mostly from British authors: 69% of Royal Society authors were from the United Kingdom in 1974. A Publications Policy Committee suggested that more overseas scientists could be encouraged to submit papers if the requirement to have papers communicated by Fellows was dropped. This did not happen until 1990. There was also a suggestion to create a \"C\" journal for molecular sciences to attract more authors in that area, but the idea never materialized. The conclusion in 1973 was a general appeal to encourage more British scientists (whether Fellows or not) to publish papers with the Society and to pass on the message to their overseas colleagues; by the early 2000s, the proportion of non-UK authors had risen to around a half; and by 2017 it had passed 80%.\n\nAs the twentieth century came to a close, the editing of the \"Transactions\" and the Society's other journals became more professional with the employment of a growing in-house staff of editors, designers and marketers. In 1968 there were about eleven staff in the Publishing Section; by 1990, the number had risen to twenty-two. The editorial processes were also transformed. In 1968 the Sectional Committees had been abolished (again). Instead, the secretaries, Harrie Massey (physicist) and Bernard Katz (physiologist), were each assigned a group of Fellows to act as Associate Editors for each series (\"A\" and \"B\") of the \"Transactions\". The role of the Committee of Papers was abolished in 1989 and since 1990 two Fellows (rather than the Secretaries) have acted as the Editors with assistance from associate editors. The editors serve on the Publishing Board, established in 1997 to monitor publishing and report to the Council. In the 1990s, as these changes to the publishing and editorial teams were implemented, the Publishing Section acquired its first computer for administration; the \"Transactions\" were first published online in 1997.\n\nOver the centuries, many important scientific discoveries have been published in the \"Philosophical Transactions\". Famous contributing authors include:\n\nIn July 2011 programmer Greg Maxwell released through \"The Pirate Bay\" the nearly 19,000 articles that had been published before 1923 and were therefore in the public domain in the United States, to support Aaron Swartz in his case. The articles had been digitized for the Royal Society by JSTOR for a cost of less than US$100,000 and public access to them was restricted through a paywall.\n\nIn August 2011, users uploaded over 18,500 articles to the collections of the Internet Archive. The collection received 50,000 views per month by November 2011.\n\nIn October of the same year, the Royal Society released for free the full text all its articles prior to 1941, but denied that this decision had been influenced by Maxwell's actions.\n\nIn 2017, the Royal Society launched a completely re-digitised version of the complete journal archive back to 1665 in high resolution and with enhanced metadata. All the out of copyright material is completely free to access without a login.\n\n\n"}

In local matters, the Patriarchal See is autonomous.\n\nThe seat of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople is the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church (Holy Mother of God Patriarchal Church) in the Kumkapı neighborhood of Istanbul. \n\nThe first Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople was Hovakim I, who was at the time the Metropolitan of Bursa. In 1461, he was brought to Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed II and established as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople. Hovakim I was recognized as the religious and secular leader of all Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, and carried the title of \"milletbaşı\" or ethnarch as well as patriarch. \n\nThere have been 85 individual Patriarchs since establishment of the Patriarchate:\n\nDuring the Ottoman Period (1461-1908), the Armenian Patriarchate served the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire with a line of Patriarchs in Constantinople. However like the Greek Patriarchate, the Armenians suffered severely from intervention by the state in their internal affairs. Although there have been 115 pontificates since 1461, there have only been 84 individual Patriarchs.\n\nIn 1896 Patriarch Madteos III (Izmirlian) was deposed and exiled to Jerusalem by Sultan Abdülhamid II for boldly denouncing the 1896 massacre. The constitution governing the Armenians was suspended by the Sultan.\n\nDuring the reign of the Young Turks (1908–1922), and after Sultan Abdulhamid II was deposed by the Young Turks, Patriarch Madteos III (Izmirlian) was permitted to return to Istanbul in 1908. \nThe new Turkish administration also restored the constitution. In the initial period of the reign of the Young Turks, the Armenians enjoyed a brief period of restoration of civil liberties between 1908 and 1915. However starting 1915, the Armenians suffered great hardship under the Young Turk administration and the Armenian community of Turkey was decimated by mass deportations of its Armenian population and the Armenian Genocide. In this critical period, the post of the Patriarch remained vacant from 1915 to 1919 to be restored for a brief period from 1919 to 1922 with Patriarch Zaven I Der Yeghiayan residing. Four Armenian Patriarchs served under the rule of the Young Turks. \nAfter the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, and despite a huge diminution in the number of its faithful during the Armenian Genocide, the patriarchate remains the spiritual head of the largest Christian community presently living in Turkey. Today, the Armenian Patriarchs are recognized as the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Turkey and he is invited to state ceremonies. Five Armenian Patriarchs have served after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nThe last patriarch Mesrob II (Mutafyan) (Մեսրոպ Բ. Մութաֆեան) was retired by the synod on October 26, 2016, because of his illness which continued more than 7 years. A new patriarch was due to be elected. On 11 December 2019, Sahak II Mashalian was elected new patriarch.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1835337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835337", "title": "The Fat Boys", "text": "The Fat Boys\n\nThe Fat Boys are an American hip hop trio from Brooklyn, New York City, that emerged in the early 1980s. The group was briefly known originally as the Disco 3, originally composed of Mark \"Prince Markie Dee\" Morales, Damon \"Kool Rock-Ski\" Wimbley and Darren \"Buff Love\" Robinson, who died of a heart attack during a bout with respiratory flu in 1995.\n\nThe trio is widely known for using beatbox in their songs. The group opened doors for beatboxers like Biz Markie and Doug E. Fresh. The Fat Boys was one of the first rap groups to release full-length rap albums, along with Run-D.M.C., Whodini and Kurtis Blow. Beloved for their comedic, self-deprecating rhymes, the group released 7 studio albums, 4 of which went Gold by RIAA.\n\nThe first two albums of the group were produced by the legendary Kurtis Blow, and they were successful due to the singles \"Jail House Rap\", \"Can You Feel It?\", \"Fat Boys\", \"Stick 'Em\", \"Don't You Dog Me\", \"All You Can Eat\", \"The Fat Boys Are Back\", \"Pump It Up\", and videos to them.\n\nThe album \"Crushin'\" received a Platinum status due to their loud single \"Wipeout\", which was recorded together with the American rock group The Beach Boys. The next album, \"Coming Back Hard Again\", repeated the formula of the previous one and received a Gold status due to the successful single \"The Twist (Yo, Twist)\", recorded together with American rock 'n roll singer Chubby Checker. The album also included the theme song for the movie \"\", which featured Robert Englund performing as Freddy Krueger.\n\nThe group also starred in three feature films in the 1980s, thereby strengthening the popularity of hip-hop in America: \"Krush Groove\", \"Knights of the City\" and \"Disorderlies\".\n\n\nIn 1983, a Swiss-born promoter named Charles Stettler, the owner of his own label Tin Pan Apple, decided to make a hip-hop talent contest. To find a sponsor, the promoter went to WBLS radio station, which recommended him to a couple of sponsors. In the end, he persuaded the company Coca-Cola to finance a contest worth $300,000. For the next three months, contests were held to identify the winner in each boroughs of New York City every Saturday afternoon.\n\nOn May 23, 1983, was held the final of the contest entitled \"Coca-Cola and WBLS present: The Tin Pan Apple After Dark Dance & Rap Contest!\". It was decided to organize an event at Radio City Music Hall, and this was the first event in the history of the concert hall, which was attended by black artists. The host that evening was Mr. Magic from the famous radio program Rap Attack at the time. According to the terms of the competition, the winner signed a contract to a record deal. The Fat Boys members, then calling themselves The Disco 3, were unexpected winners. They won the contest with the song \"Stick' Em\".\n\nIn 1983, the group released their debut single \"Reality\" under the name The Disco 3. The single was produced by jazz guitarist and keyboardist of Roy Ayers' jazz-funk band, James Mason.\n\nSince the group did not have a manager, Charles Stettler took over this position. Stettler took the group to the European Bus Tour, where he told them to gain more weight. The concerts ended at 12 o'clock in the evening, and they could not get to the hotel until two o'clock in the morning, and only places like McDonald's and Burger King were open. So they gained weight. But since so much was happening, the group members did not even notice it on the tour and did not consider themselves fat. And once their manager offered them to call themselves The Fat Boys. On the occasion of the renaming of the group, was held a party at the Roseland Ballroom in New York.\n\nCharlie Stettler introduced the group to producer Kurtis Blow, who gave them his signature sound. To work on the album, Kurtis Blow recruited drum machine programmers of Run-D.M.C., Larry Smith and Davy \"DMX\" Reeves, both were of the best in making songs at the time. \"Stick' Em\" was the first song they recorded with Kurtis Blow.\n\nThe group's 1984 self-titled debut album, \"Fat Boys\", is considered by many to be the first hip-hop album to feature such an element as beatbox. Darren \"The Human Beat Box\" Robinson was a pioneer in beatboxing, he used his mouth to create hip-hop percussion sounds. He and another rapper, Doug E. Fresh, popularized beatboxing, inspiring other artists to innovate, including Biz Markie.\n\nOne day in 1984, Russell Simmons storming into Stettler's office and told him that he was going to make a Fresh Fest Tour '84 festival, in which his groups and break dancers would take part. And since Stettler raised $300,000 from Coca-Cola to finance his 1983 contest, Simmons wanted Stettler to do it again. But the young promoter could not return to the beverage company, so he called his only Swiss friend and asked him if there was anything the Swiss were trying to sell. Wrist watch Swatch turned out to be such a product. Stettler persuaded the company to finance a tour of $360,000, while the festival had to be renamed The Swatch Watch New York City Fresh Fest.\n\nRussell Simmons didn't want to take The Fat Boys on the tour, because nobody heard of them at that point. Then Stettler went to an old Tower Records store on Broadway and handed out 5,000 flyers that read: \"Guess the weight of The Fat Boys and the person who wins hits 800 cans of diet Pepsi and one dollar\". Therefore, thousands of children lined up at the Tower Records store. Stettler put the group members on the scale, at that time they weighed . In the end, the boy from Harlem won. Channel 2 for its news filmed this event on camera, including how pepsi-cola was delivered to Harlem. Then Stettler called Russell Simmons to show him such a group ad. In response, Simmons said that this is just a local advertising.\n\nThe next day, Stettler saw in the newspaper that The Jackson 5 was going to be reunited at a concert in October 1984. So he called his wife and part-time partner and asked her to write a press release saying that The Jackson 5 have picked an unknown group The Fat Boys as their opening act. As a result, Stettler himself distributed this press release across the city. The next morning, Stettler, together with the group The Fat Boys, got on the TV show Good Morning America, and when the host turns around to The Fat Boys and they don't know what to say, they just go: \"Brrr, Stick' Em! Ha-ha-ha, Stick 'Em!\", because it was the group's popular song at the time.\n\nSo Russell Simmons agreed to add The Fat Boys to the lineup, which included Run-D.M.C., Kurtis Blow, Whodini, Newcleus and The Dynamic Breakers. The first concert of the tour took place on Labor Day, September 3, 1984. For 27 concerts in the United States, the organizers managed to raise $3.5 million. The festival was accompanied by advertising on television.\n\nIn 1985, it was followed by Fresh Fest II, which included the same acts, with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five replacing Newcleus.\n\nAt this time, the American office of the company Swatch was tasked with trying to advertise their product to American audiences. The company was known for using offbeat campaigns, and agreed to feature the Fat Boys in a commercial for the watches on MTV. The video \"Brrr, Swatch ’Em!\" was aired in December 1984. Swatch again featured The Fat Boys in a 1985 Christmas advertisement created by former MTV creative heads Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert. This commercial, \"Swatch Watch Presents A Merry Christmas\" was first broadcast in December 1985. These commercials were notable, because when they aired in December of 1984, MTV did not feature many hip-hop artists in their programming, having only started airing music videos from rap artists earlier that year with Run-D.M.C.’s crossover hit, “Rock Box.” Due to the success of these commercials, they would become frequent guests on MTV, pioneering a space for hip-hop artists to appear on the network and ultimately increasing hip hop’s popularity and legitimacy with MTV’s audience. \n\nBecause of these commercials, the group developed a reputation for their sense of humor. They starred in several feature films. Their first starring role came in the movie \"Krush Groove\" (1985), followed by a second, \"Disorderlies\" (1987), which also featured Ralph Bellamy as a millionaire invalid cared for by his good-natured yet inept orderlies (played by the Fat Boys), with a cameo by manager Stettler.\n\nHoping to repeat the success of Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith with the single \"Walk This Way\" The Fat Boys made a cover version of the song \"Wipeout\" together with rock group The Beach Boys. The single peaked at number 12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song \"Wipeout\" reached #2 on UK Top 100 in September 1987 during a 13-week chart run. \"Wipeout\" was the last song the group members recorded for the album \"Crushin'\", but it was she who helped the album received a Platinum status in the United States.\n\nThe music video begins with an announcement of a boxing match, The Fat Boys and The Beach Boys are attending the match. The match is interrupted by a fight. In the following scene, The Fat Boys load up a car with swimsuits and then drive off. The Beach Boys are driving in a dune buggy through the city. Both bands go around the city in the direction of a beach, while they perform the song and animate the inhabitants of the city to come to the beach. Meanwhile, at the beach one of The Fat Boys tries to lift a heavy weight and is laughed at by two women because of failure, another playing volleyball and another surfing. The Beach Boys on the other hand are DJing in the street. In the course of the video all celebrate a beach party.\n\nThe group was later approached to record the theme song for \"\" (1988), called \"Are You Ready for Freddy\", which featured Robert Englund performing as Freddy Krueger.\n\nThe next album called \"Coming Back Hard Again\" repeated the formula of the previous one. This time, The Fat Boys recorded a cover version of the song \"The Twist\" with Chubby Checker, who performed it originally in 1960. The single peaked at number 16 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 40 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song \"The Twist (Yo, Twist)\" reached number two on UK Top 100 in July 1988 during a 11-week chart run. Another song from the album, \"Louie Louie\", is a cover version of a 1957 song by American singer Richard Berry. The song peaked at number 46 on UK Top 100 on November 5, 1988 for 4 weeks.\n\nHowever, the tastes of the listeners at that time have already changed. By taking part in the rash rap opera \"On And On\", the group tried to regain its fame, but this only accelerated the breakup of the group. Prince Markie Dee left the group to pursue solo interests, which included producing many early tracks for Mariah Carey and Mary J. Blige which included her debut single, \"Real Love\". In 1991, the remaining two members, Kool Rock-Ski and Buff Love, carried on as a duo and released \"Mack Daddy\" (1991), but shortly thereafter, the group disbanded (until 2008).

The Shikhapatri is believed to have been written in the current form in Sanskrit by Satanand Swami, who incorporated into and compiled the scripture known as Satsangi Jivan. The Shikshapatri is a key scripture to all followers of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya and is considered the basis of the sect.\n\nThe Shikshapatri was written in Vadtal on (Maha Sud 5, 1882 VS) 11 February 1826. It is a dharma text, providing detailed instructions on how to live a spiritually uplifting life.\n\nThe Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised the teachings of the Shiskshapatri as:\nThe book of precepts strictly prohibits the destruction of animal life; promiscuous intercourse with the other sex; use of animal food and intoxicant liquors and drugs on any occasion, suicide, theft and robbery; false accusation against a fellow man; blasphemy; company of atheists and heretics, and other practices which might counteract the effect of the founder's teaching. \nOn 26 February 1830 a historic meeting took place between Swaminarayan and Sir John Malcolm, the then Governor of Bombay. At this meeting, Swaminarayan presented a copy of the Shikshapatri to Sir John Malcolm. This copy is now housed at the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford.\n\nSwaminarayan instructed Nityanand Swami to translate Shikshapatri from Sanskrit into Gujarati. It has since been translated numerous times into other languages. It has been translated to Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Udiya, Urdu, Vraj, Afrikaans, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Modern Hebrew, North Sotho, Portuguese, Russian, South Sotho, Spanish, Swahili, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\n"}

Population: \n\nIt was previously known as \"Zvanka\" (until December 27, 1933), \"Volkhovstroy\" (until April 11, 1940).\n\nThe town developed during the industrialization in the first half of the 20th century. The settlement of Zvanka () with a train depot was built here while the railway connecting St. Petersburg with Vologda was being constructed. It was a part of Novoladozhsky Uyezd of St. Petersburg Governorate. A second rail line running north of the station towards Murmansk was constructed in 1916, making the station an important railway junction. In 1918, construction of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station (the first in the Soviet Union) started on this spot. In 1926, the power plant became operational and in 1932, the first Soviet aluminum plant was launched nearby.\n\nOn August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Volkhovsky District, with the administrative center in Zvanka, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On August 15, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On December 27, 1933, the settlements serving the station, the dam, and the aluminum plant were merged with several adjacent villages to form the town of Volkhovstroy. On September 19, 1939, Volkhovstroy became a town of oblast significance and on April 11, 1940, it was renamed Volkhov. During World War II, between 1941 and 1944, the Volkhov River separated the Soviet and the German positions, and Volkhov was a battleground scene. The city itself was never occupied by German troops, and in December 1941 the advance of the German troops to Volkhov was stopped by the Red Army.\n\nIn 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure and Volkhov became a town of district significance.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Volkhov serves as the administrative center of Volkhovsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Volkhovsky District as Volkhovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Volkhovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Volkhovsky Municipal District as Volkhovskoye Urban Settlement.\n\nThe economy of Volkhov is essentially based on the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station and on the aluminum production plant.\n\nVolkhov (railway stations Volkhovstroy I and Volkhovstroy II) is an important railway hub. One railway line connects in with St. Petersburg (Moskovsky Rail Terminal), and Volkhovstroy I is the terminal station of suburban trains from St. Petersburg. To the east, a railway line continues to Vologda via Tikhvin and Cherepovets. Another railway line passing through Volkhov connects Chudovo in the south and Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk, and ultimately Murmansk in the north. In Chudovo, it connects to railway between St. Petersburg and Moscow, so that all traffic between Moscow and Murmansk proceeds via Volkhovstroy.\n\nVolkhov is located on the road connecting Kiselnya on the M18 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk, and Tikhvin, Cherepovets and Vologda. Volkhov is also connected by roads with Kirishi and with Novaya Ladoga. There are also local roads, with bus traffic originating from Volkhov.\n\nThe Volkhov River is navigable; however, there is no passenger navigation.\n\nThe district contains five cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally seventeen objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are the Volkhov Hydroelectric station, the monument to Genrikh Graftio, the head of the construction of the power plant, the first building of the aluminum plant, as well as the houses where Graftio and Boris Vedeneyev, who was also leading the power plant construction, lived.\n\nVolkhov is twinned with:\n\n"}

PGPLOT is written mostly in FORTRAN with a modular output API that allows output to several dozen types of plotting device. PGPLOT has been widely used in the academic and scientific communities, because it provides both low-level (glyph, point, line, and area) plotting primitives and also high-level facilities for drawing graphs. PGPLOT may be redistributed to third parties and modified, but only in binary form. Neither the original nor modified source code are allowed to be redistributed. The most recent version of PGPLOT is 5.2.2, released in February 2001, although third parties have written unofficial patches that include support for additional devices, 64 bit systems, and RGB (true color) plotting.\n\nPGPLOT provides C and Fortran 77 interface. There are also several user-contributed bindings, such as C++, perl, python, ruby and tcl/tk.\n\nPGPLOT includes device-independent output to many devices including several types of image file, graphics display terminals and plotters, PostScript devices, and X Window. Interactive devices can be used to deliver numeric parameters to the controlling program via a graphics cursor. It is known to run on many operating systems, including most Unix-like systems, Mac OS, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nIn part because of its age, PGPLOT has several limitations compared to newer packages such as PLplot. In particular, PGPLOT supports only 8-bit indexed color graphics, and not full RGB color; and there is no clean way to render graphics directly to an array in program memory. The library PG2PLplot has been developed to aid the transition from PGPlot to PLplot in Fortran programs.\n\n"}

He is a currently manager of Needham Market and assistant manager of the Northern Ireland under-21 team. Horlock is a former Northern Ireland international and is most associated with Manchester City, for whom he played in three different divisions including the Premier League. He also played for Swindon Town, West Ham United, Ipswich Town, Doncaster Rovers and Mansfield Town. Horlock was well known for his accurate set pieces and is particularly skilled at taking free kicks.\n\nHorlock started his career as a trainee with West Ham United in 1989 but did not graduate to the first team and moved to Swindon Town in August 1992 where he spent a single season in the Premier League in 1993–94. Over the next few seasons he made his name as a versatile midfielder capable of playing on the left or in the centre, or at left-back. He also scored goals regularly, with 16 in the 1995–96 season. He made 200 appearances in all competitions, scoring 26 goals, in five seasons at Swindon before joining Manchester City in January 1997.\n\nHorlock was Frank Clark's first signing for Manchester City for a transfer fee reported as being between £1.25 million and £1.5 million. He made his debut in a 4–1 Division One win against Oxford United and scored his first goal for Manchester City three weeks later against his former club Swindon. The following season, he was a regular in the first team until suffering an injury which sidelined him for four months. During Horlock's absence, Clark was sacked and chairman Francis Lee later observed that Horlock was one of only two good purchases Clark made. City were struggling at the foot of the table, and were relegated on the final day of the season despite a 5–2 win at Stoke City, in which Horlock scored the fifth goal. Horlock became Manchester City's primary penalty taker in the 1998–99 season, a role in which he continued for the next three seasons. Later that season Horlock was sent off in a match against Bournemouth in unusual circumstances, receiving a second yellow card for \"walking towards the referee in an aggressive manner while asking a question\". Horlock's best season was probably the 2001–2002 season where he was deployed in the holding midfield role and helped Manchester City earn promotion in stylish manner, the team scoring 108 goals. One of the most notable moments of his career was the 1999 season play-off final against Gillingham when he scored the first goal of the comeback when Manchester City won on penalties after being 2–0 down until the last five minutes of the game. Horlock wore the number 6 shirt Horlock made 232 league and cup appearances, scoring 44 goals, in seven years at Manchester City.\n\nHorlock was signed by Glenn Roeder for West Ham United for a fee of £300,000 in August 2003. He made 27 league appearances for West Ham in the 2003–04 season and scored once against Wigan but fell out of favour with manager Alan Pardew and missed the play-offs games at the end of the season. He was given a free transfer to Ipswich Town in July 2004, where he made 58 league appearances before joining Doncaster Rovers on loan in February 2006 and being allowed to leave Ipswich at the end of the 2005–06 season. He joined Doncaster on a permanent two-year contract in May 2006 but missed the majority of the 2006–07 season due to a serious knee injury sustained in Doncaster's 3–1 victory over Crewe Alexandra in August 2006, a game in which he also scored his first goal for the club. A dislocated shoulder further restricted his opportunities, and in January 2008 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent. The next day, Horlock was signed by Scunthorpe United on a contract until the end of the season. However, he did not feature in the first team and joined Mansfield Town in March 2008 on loan until the end of the 2007–08 season.\nHorlock signed for Eastern Counties League Premier Division side Needham Market as player/assistant manager on a twelve-month contract on 8 August 2008.\n\nHorlock was first capped in April 1995 versus Latvia and went on to make 32 appearances for Northern Ireland, before retiring from international football in 2003 for personal reasons. In August 2013 Horlock was appointed assistant manager of the Northern Ireland under 21 team.\n\nHorlock progressed through the coaching ranks at his former club Needham Market, where he had been assistant manager and had set up the club's academy in 2010. He left in 2015 when he was appointed as manager of Isthmian League Division One South side Chatham Town on 15 October 2015. Horlock combined both his Needham Market and Chatham Town roles with the assistant manager's job to the Northern Ireland under-21 team, a position he was appointed to in August 2013.\n\nHorlock left Chatham on 1 May 2016 to concentrate on his coaching roles with Northern Ireland and Colchester United, having guided Chatham to a 19th-position finish in the league. Horlock had been coaching Colchester's under-18 side alongside Wayne Brown. He was named as Brown's assistant for the under-21 side following a number of coaching changes at the U's. This coincided with the announcement that Horlock would take charge of Maldon & Tiptree in the Isthmian League Division One North on 16 May, taking over from Steve Ball. He guided the Jammers to second position in the table, securing a place in the play-offs.\n\nIn May 2018, Horlock and Wayne Brown switched roles, with Horlock taking charge of Colchester's under-23 team and Brown taking the reins at Maldon & Tiptree. On 20 June 2019, Horlock left Colchester to return to Needham Market as the clubs new academy manager. He was appointed manager of Needham Market in February 2020.\n\nIndividual\n"}

If activated for federal service, the wing is gained by Air Combat Command.\n\nThe 116th ACW is the only Air National Guard unit operating the E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS), an airborne ground surveillance and battle management aircraft. Joint STARS detects, locates, classifies, tracks and targets ground movements on the battlefield, communicating real-time information through secure data links with U.S. command posts.\n\nOn 1 October 2002, the 116th ACW was established as the first (and only) Joint Air National Guard/United States Air Force Unit. The Joint Unit was inactivated on 30 September 2011 and the 116th ACW was returned to the sole jurisdiction of the Georgia Air National Guard on 1 October 2011.\n\n\nThe 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron, assigned to the Wing's 116th Operations Group, traces its lineage to the 840th Aero Squadron, established on 1 February 1918. It was reformed on 1 May 1941, as the 128th Observation Squadron, one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II.\n\nThe 116th Fighter Group was federalized on 10 October 1950 due to the Korean War. It was redesignated the 116th Fighter-Bomber Group, assigned to Tactical Air Command and moved to George Air Force Base, California. At George, the 116th Group was assigned to the newly activated 116th Fighter-Bomber Wing on 1 November as it reorganized under the wing base organization.\n\nAt George the wing's three fighter squadrons were equipped with Lockheed F-80C Shooting Stars and began operational training. After losing many of their F-80 pilots to assignment to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) as replacements, all three squadrons were forced to transfer pilots between themselves in order to maintain a balance of qualified pilots, and they were no longer individual squadrons of Georgia, Florida and California. In April 1951 the wing began receiving brand new Republic F-84E Thunderjets directly from Republic Aircraft. On 14 May the wing received a warning order for an impending transfer, and they expected to be transferred to Europe. With a readiness date of 25 June, the 116th was ready to move, and by 1 July they had sent their seventy-five F-84Es to the New York Port of Embarkation for shipment to France. However, on 3 July 1951 they received orders transferring them to Japan. Fifty-four F-84Es had to be obtained from Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas and Langley Air Force Base, Virginia as partial replacements for these Thunderjets.\n\nThe 116th FBG with the 158th and 159th FBS's departed from San Diego on the transport aircraft carrier USS Windham Bay on 12 July, white the 196th FBS had preceded them by two days on the . The USAF, having learned from the expensive previous experience with open air transportation of the F-84 on an aircraft carrier deck, heavily protected their F-84s this time with cosmoline and tarpaulins. The Wing off-loaded at Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan between 24–27 July, with their aircraft being barged to Kisarazu, Japan for cleaning and preparation for flight. Regardless of the care taken, thirty-three F-84s suffered some degree of salt damage.\n\nTwo squadrons, the 158th and 159th were then sent to Misawa Air Base, Japan while the 196th was established at Chitose Air Base, Japan. Their initial role was to serve as an augmentation of Japanese air defenses, and their operational training began on 6 August. The 116th remained on garrison duty in Japan into the fall of 1951. During this period they concentrated on providing air-to-ground support to Army units training in Japan as well as assisting in providing aerial defense of northern Japan as a supplement to the other air defense units.\n\nOn 30 November 1951 the 159th Squadron was alerted for a combat role, and on 2 December they dispatched sixteen F-84Es to Taegu Air Base (K-2), South Korea. The 159th flew their first combat mission of twelve Thunderjets against rail targets at Wonsan in southeastern North Korea that morning. Three F-84s suffered flak damage. They then returned again that afternoon. The following day they returned to Wonsan two fly two more strikes. Further missions were flown on 4 and 5 December, and then on 6 December they sent twelve F-84s to Sinanju and Sunchon, North Korea on a rail cutting mission, and then returned to Misawa.\nOn 12 December wing pilots flew eighty-eight effective combat sorties. On 25 December 15 the 158th Squadron was attacking a train when they were jumped by North Korean MiG-15s that attacked from 20,000 feet in pairs from the F-84s' six o'clock high position. Captain Paul Mitchel, flying as \"Able 3\" saw two MiGs behind two F-84s, so he came in behind them and closed to 100 feet, firing on the MiG leader's wingman. The MiG pilot bailed out, and his leader slowed down to see what was happening, so Mitchel fired on him, too, scoring some hits. Mitchel was credited with 1-0-1, obtaining the last officially credited F-84 MiG kill during the Korean War, and the only \"kill\" for the 116th Wing. The following day, 16 December the 158th lost their only aircraft attributed to enemy action during the conflict. While strafing ox carts south of Pyongyang Captain David Mather, \"George 3\", was hit by antiaircraft fire and his F-84 burst into flames. His wingman told him to bail out, and Mather's canopy was seen to come off, but the F-84 crashed before he could get out. On 18 December the 158th returned to Japan.\n\nThe 196th Squadron started for Taegu on 26 December for their turn, but didn't get there until 28 December, because of weather problems. The 196th flew missions from K-2 until 3 January 1952, mostly close air support, with a 70% accuracy, and returned to Japan on 4 January 1952. The 116th Group returned to combat on 26 May 1952. The first mission was with sixteen F-84Es that flew from Misawa to Chitose Air Base for a pilot briefing, and then after arming with 500-pound general-purpose bombs, they took off for an attack against Sariwon, in southwestern North Korea. The F-84s were refueled en route by Boeing KB-29 Superfortress tankers near Taegu, South Korea, upon their return from the target, which gave any aircraft unable to be air refueled an alternate landing spot. After refueling the mission landed at Johnson Air Base, Japan and resumed the air defense mission.\n\nOn 10 June 1952 the 116th was relieved from active duty. The remaining guardsmen were returned to the United States, the jets and equipment of the Wing were then transferred to the 474th Fighter-Bomber Wing and assigned to Fifth Air Force.\n\nThe wing was redesignated the 116th Fighter-Interceptor Wing and allotted to the Georgia Air National Guard on 10 July and activated at Dobbins Air Force Base. At this time the 116th Group was restructured to include the 128th and 158th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons. Initially upon their return to state control both squadrons were equipped with the long-range North American F-51H Mustang and given an air defense mission. The 116th was gained by Air Defense Command (ADC), upon mobilization, being assigned to the 35th Air Division with a mission of the air defense of the Southeastern United States.\n\nCommencing in February 1953 the 128th began conversion to the F-84D Thunderjet, yet most were not received until mid summer. During the summer of 1955 the 128th was redesignated as the 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and converted the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak. Strangely enough, it was not until March 1957 that the surviving D models were dispatched for salvage, with eleven of those aged D models having been lost in accidents while serving with the 128th.\n\nIn 1958, the 116th implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 128th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert. In 1960 the F-84s were replaced by the North American F-86L Sabre, a day/night/all-weather aircraft designed to be integrated into the ADC SAGE interceptor direction and control system.\n\nIn 1961, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) became the 116th's gaining command as the wing traded in its Sabre interceptors for 4-engined Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter transports. The 116th Wing was assigned to Eastern Transport Air Force and flew long-distance transport missions in support of Air Force requirements, frequently sending aircraft to the Caribbean, Europe, Greenland, and the Middle East in support of Air Force requirements.\n\nIn 1966 MATS was replaced by Military Airlift Command (MAC) and EASTAF became Twenty-First Air Force. The 116th Wing upgraded to the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II strategic heavy airlifter, being the first Air National Guard unit to receive the aircraft. Due to requirements generated by the Vietnam War, missions were flown across the Pacific to Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Okinawa and Thailand.\n\nIn the years after the Vietnam War, the transport requirements of MAC along with the retirement of the C-124 led the 116th to be reassigned back to Tactical Air Command in 1974 and was re-equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre tactical fighter-bombers, many aircraft being veterans of the Vietnam War. The 128th flew the Super Sabre jets for six accident-free years until May 1979 when the last aircraft left Dobbins to be retired as part of the phaseout of the F-100 from the inventory. During that time, one F-100D made a crash landing at Dobbins due to its nose gear failing to lower and lock in place shortly before the aircraft were to be retired.\n\nThe F-100s were replaced with other Vietnam-era hand-me-down combat veteran aircraft by TAC during the early 1980s, as Republic F-105 Thunderchief Wild Weasel electronic warfare aircraft were assigned, then retired and McDonnell F-4 Phantom II fighter bombers in their final years of service.\n\nIn 1986 the 116th retired the last of its Vietnam War Phantoms and received McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle air superiority fighters. The F-15A was introduced into the inventory in the mid-1970s and now were being upgraded in the active duty by the improved F-15C. The 116th flew the F-15 for the next ten years. The 116th Tactical Fighter Wing developed an impressive record of accomplishment and was awarded nine Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards.\n\nIn 1992 as part of the post Cold War reorganizations of the Air Force, the 116th converted to the Air Force Objective organization and the 128th was assigned to the reactivated 116th Operations Group. In 1992 Tactical Air Command was inactivated and the 116th was assigned to the new Air Combat Command (ACC).\n\nAfter calling Dobbins home for 50 years, the 116th was presented with a new challenge in 1996. The wing simultaneously converted from the F-15 Eagle fighters to the Rockwell B-1 Lancer strategic bomber and moved 110 miles south to Robins Air Force Base near Warner Robins, Georgia. As part of the post Cold-War drawdown, the active-duty fleet of B-1Bs were being reduced for budget reductions and being taken off alert status by the former Strategic Air Command.\n\nHaving to make the most of the available facilities, including the former Strategic Air Command alert facility at Robins, the 116th Bomb Wing was quickly up and running and participated in a number of deployments and exercises around the world in the B-1B.\n\nDue to fiscal constraints, in 2002 the USAF agreed to reduce its fleet of B-1Bs from 92 to 60 aircraft, to include removing all B-1 aircraft assigned to the Air National Guard. The 116th Bomb Wing, having older aircraft was ordered to send its aircraft to \"active storage\" which meant that they could be quickly returned to service should circumstances dictate. Its first B-1B was flown to storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona on 20 August.\n\nUnder the Air Force's Total Force Initiative as a \"blended\" wing, the former 93d Air Control Wing, an active-duty Air Combat Command unit, and the 116th Bomb Wing, a Georgia Air National Guard unit, were inactivated effective 1 October 2002.\n\nThe 116th was immediately re-activated and redesignated as the 116th Air Control Wing. The 116th was a blend of active-duty and national guard airmen in a single unit. The wing was equipped with the new E-8C Joint STARS airborne battle management aircraft. Its mission is command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. Its primary mission is to provide theater ground and air commanders with ground surveillance to support attack operations and targeting that contributes to the delay, disruption and destruction of enemy forces. The E-8C evolved from Army and Air Force programs to develop, detect, locate and attack enemy armor at ranges beyond the forward area of troops.\nIn 2006, the National Guard Bureau conducted a facility assessment and determined that the 116th CES was residing in the second worst engineering compound in the Air National Guard. This led to another building being identified for the squadron's new compound, and funding being appropriated for a concept study on how to adapt the facility for CES' needs.\n\nIn April 2010, The 116th Air Control Wing became the first ever Georgia Air National Guard unit to send a team to the Mountain Man Memorial March, held in Gatlinburg, Tennessee to honor those who have fallen in combat. The wing team sponsored Capt Dixon L. Walters, who was shot down over Kuwait on 31 January 1991.\n\nThe 128th Airborne Command and Control Squadron has flown more than 82,000 combat hours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn Operation Odyssey Dawn, and Operation Unified Protector. Beginning in 2011, its operational resume expanded to include support of five Combatant Commands including U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command.\n\nOn 24 November 2010, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Designated the 116th Air Control Wing as an \"Active Associate\" wing and reorganized the \"blended\" wing concept. As a result of this reorganization, a new active duty associate wing was formed. The structure is an association of the Georgia Air Guard's 116th Wing and the active duty 461st Air Control Wing. They will continue to operate together to accomplish the shared J-STARS mission by integrating Air Guard and active duty personnel to the maximum extent possible in groups, squadrons, and shops. The Active Association model is one in which a reserve component (the Air Guard) has principal responsibility for the weapon system that it shares with one or more Active Duty Units.\n\nOn 1 October 2011 the 116th Air Control Wing was inactivated as a Joint Air National Guard/United States Air Force Unit. Reasons cited were that updated Air Force regulations did not cover the blended unit, leading to anomalies in how promotions, disciplinary actions and other administrative issues were handled, according to the Air Force. The 116th was returned to the sole jurisdiction of the Georgia Air National Guard that same day, and reactivated. The unit's 17 J-STARS aircraft remained under the control of the Georgia Air National Guard, though the active duty pilots continue to fly with their Guard counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Population: \n\nIt was previously known as \"Soltsy\" (until 1931).\n\nThe name of the town originates from the Kirisha River (previously known as Kiresha), a tributary of the Volkhov River.\n\nIt was first mentioned in 1693. Since 1727, it was a part of Novoladozhsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate, later of St. Petersburg Governorate. In 1922–1923, the uyezd was renamed Volkhovsky. Before 1931, Kirishi was known as Soltsy.\n\nOn August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Andreyevsky District, with the administrative center in the \"selo\" of Andreyevo, was established. The governorates were also abolished and the district became a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Kirishi became a part of Andreyevsky District. On September 30, 1931, the administrative center of the district was moved to Kirishi and the district was renamed Kirishsky. On December 27, 1933 Kirishi was granted urban-type settlement status. Kirishi was occupied for two years during World War II and completely destroyed in 1943, so that on February 19, 1944 the administrative center of the district was moved to the urban-type settlement of Budogoshch.\n\nIn 1960, Kirishi was rebuilt and the Kirishi oil refinery was constructed. On February 1, 1963, the district was abolished and merged into Volkhovsky District but on January 12, 1965 it was re-established. Kirishi was granted town status and made the administrative center of the district. On January 26, 1967, Kirishi became a town of oblast significance. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure, and Kirishi became a town of district significance.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Kirishi serves as the administrative center of Kirishsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kirishsky District as Kirishskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Kirishskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kirishsky Municipal District as Kirishskoye Urban Settlement.\n\nIn 1974, a \"BVK\" (\"belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat\", i.e., \"protein-vitamin concentrate\") production facility was constructed next to the oil refinery. This was the USSR Ministry of Microbiological Industry's second plant of this kind (after the one in Kstovo, opened in 1973). It used n-paraffins (byproducts of oil refining) as feedstock for yeast, which in its turn produced single-cell protein, used as poultry and cattle feed.\n\nAfter a 1987 accident at the microbiological plant, mass protests forced the Supreme Soviet (1989) to close down the facility, as well as its seven sister plants throughout the Soviet Union.\n\nThere are several oil refineries and chemical industry enterprises. The biggest of them is Kinef. Kirishi Power Station, a thermal power station, is located in Kirishi as well.\n\nKirishi is also planned to serve as the home of Russia's first residual oil high conversion refinery, the Kirishi-2 Oil Refinery, which is scheduled to open in 2017. \n\nThe railroad connecting Sonkovo and Mga passes through Kirishi. Another railway branches off north. It connects Kirishi with Tikhvin, which lies on the line connecting St. Petersburg and Vologda via Cherepovets.\n\nKirishi is connected by road with Volkhov and Chudovo. There are also local roads.\n\nThe Volkhov River is navigable in Kirishi; however, there is no passenger navigation.\n\nThe district contains seven objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance.

From German immigrant stock, his parents named him for a regionally known Baptist minister, James Furman. After initially attending Furman University, Bisher attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a manager for the North Carolina Tar Heels football team. After graduating from UNC in 1938, he became the editor of the \"Lumberton Voice\" newspaper in Lumberton, North Carolina at the age of 20. During World War II, he served as a lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Navy from 1941 to 1945, editing a military newspaper and managing the Armed Services Radio Network in the South Pacific. After his military service ended, he went to work at the \"High Point Enterprise\" in High Point, North Carolina, and then the \"Charlotte News\" in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he became the sports editor in 1948.\n\nBisher landed an interview with former professional baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson in 1949—the first published interview with Jackson since the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. It was the only interview that the former Chicago White Sox outfielder and star hitter would ever give about his alleged involvement in the fixing of the 1919 World Series, and the old ballplayer maintained his innocence to the end, trusting only Bisher to tell his story. In an era when most other sports writers refused to acknowledge auto racing, he also covered the first stock car cup race in 1949—what would later become known as NASCAR.\n\nBisher wrote his first column for \"The Atlanta Constitution\" on April 15, 1950, and became well known regionally and nationally during his fifty-nine years as a sports reporter, columnist and editor for the \"Constitution\", its afternoon sister, \"The Atlanta Journal\", and their combined successor, \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\". Bisher also wrote articles and columns for \"The Sporting News\", \"Sports Illustrated\", \"The Saturday Evening Post\", and several other national publications. His final column for \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" was published online on Saturday, October 10, 2009, with the print version appearing in the October 11, 2009 Sunday paper.\n\nHe became embroiled in a national controversy in 1962 after he contributed to an article for \"The Saturday Evening Post\" which alleged that the University of Georgia's former head football coach and then-current athletic director Wally Butts and coach Bear Bryant of the University of Alabama conspired to fix the outcome of a college football game. Bisher conducted several interviews for the story that were ultimately not used in the final published version of the article. In a libel suit brought by Butts, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Butts' favor. Bryant reached an out-of-court settlement with \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Commenting on the controversy years later, Bisher called it the \"Ugliest part of my career. . . . Some people in Alabama still think I wrote it.\"\n\n\"Time\" magazine named Bisher one of the nation's five best columnists in 1961. He is a member of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame, the University of North Carolina Journalism Hall of Fame, the International Golf Writers Hall of Fame, the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, the Atlanta Sports Hall of Fame, and the Atlanta Press Club Hall of Fame. He was chosen the Georgia Sportswriter of the Year on sixteen occasions, and recognized by the Associated Press for the best Georgia story of the year over twenty times. He received numerous other awards over the years, including the Associated Press Sports Editors' Red Smith Award, and the William D. Richardson Award from the Golf Writers Association of America.\n\nBisher was the president of the Football Writers Association of America from 1959 to 1960, and the president of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association from 1974 to 1976. He was an outspoken proponent of professional sports in Atlanta, and was a charter member of the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium Authority at a time when it wasn't deemed a conflict of interest for a journalist to serve in such a capacity.\n\nHe co-wrote the first autobiography of Hank Aaron, titled \"Aaron, RF\" upon its initial release in 1968. In 1974, with Aaron about to become the all-time home run king, Bisher added an afterword to include the seasons from 1968 through 1973. The new edition was simply titled \"Aaron\", as the subject was no longer a right fielder.\n\nBisher habitually signed off his columns with the Hebrew word \"Selah\" from the Book of Psalms. After retiring from \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" in 2009, he continued to write a column for the \"Gwinnett Daily Post\" in Gwinnett County, Georgia in suburban Atlanta, starting in January 2010. He estimated that he had written 15,000 daily sports columns, 1,200 magazine articles and more than a dozen books.\n\nUntil the age of 90, Bisher held seniority over the hundreds of golf reporters and other sports journalists who descend on Augusta, Georgia, each April for the Masters Tournament. During the 2006 tournament, The Golf Channel profiled Bisher as the \"dean\" of Masters journalists. Bisher covered every Kentucky Derby since 1950, and every Super Bowl but the first.\n\nHe died from a heart attack on March 18, 2012. He was survived by his second wife Lynda and two of his three sons from his first marriage.\n\n\n"}

Proving to be successful, it remained in service for a number of years post-war in both civilian and military roles in the Soviet Union, and with the air forces of several allied nations. 550 built, in use until 1956 (USSR) and 1960 (foreign users).\n\nThe German invasion of the USSR revealed that there was an urgent requirement for a light transport and utility aircraft for use by the Soviet Air Force at the front. To meet this requirement, Aleksei Shcherbakov, who had previously worked at the Kalinin design bureau, and who had also heavily influenced the design of the Polikarpov I-153 fighter before conducting work on pressure cabins and gliders, was directed to design and develop an aircraft that received the designation \"TS-1\".\n\nA cabin monoplane of semi-cantilever, high-wing configuration, the TS-1 was designed to minimise the use of strategic materials, utilising mostly wood in the construction of its remarkably streamlined airframe, and being powered by two readily available Shvetsov M-11 radial engines. Parts of the Lavochkin La-5 aircraft were also used, along with undercarriage parts from the Ilyushin Il-2. The aircraft was equipped with a fixed, conventional taildragger undercarriage, and a twin-fin tail from the Petlyakov Pe-2 was also utilised.\n\nTest-flown in late 1942 and early 1943, the aircraft, by now having been redesignated Shche-2, proved to be capable of meeting the requirement, and production began in October 1943 at \"OKB-47\", the bureaux being established at Chkalov (Orenburg) for use by Yakovlev, but being transferred to Shcherbakov's control for the manufacture of his type.\n\nThe Shche-2 was capable of transporting up to 16 troops, with an alternative air ambulance configuration for up to 11 wounded, or cargo up to by in size. Alternatively, the aircraft could be used as an aircrew and navigational trainer. It was extensively used in the transport and communications roles on the Eastern Front, providing essential, if unglamorous, service.\n\nIn 1945, the improved Shche-2TM variant entered flight test, powered by uprated M-11FM engines of each, and fitted with a modified wing. Despite the improvements in the design, the decision was made not to produce the aircraft due to a reduction in requirements for the type with the end of the war in May of that year. A proposed diesel-engined version, which began flight tests in July 1945, met the same fate.\n\nProving in service to be underpowered yet still easy to fly, and establishing a reputation for reliability and ease of maintenance, the Shche-2 was widely used by Soviet forces during the war. Seeing extensive service supplying guerrilla and partisan forces, the Shche-2 also proved to be useful for the delivery of paratroopers.\n\nIt is estimated that at least 550 Shche-2 aircraft were completed before the close of production in 1946, the OKB-47 factory being closed down at the conclusion of production. After the end of the war, the aircraft remained in service for several years, with the air forces of Yugoslavia and Poland making use of the type, in addition to the aircraft being extensively utilised in transport and air ambulance duties in civilian service within the Soviet Union. In addition, the Shche-2 was operated by Aeroflot on several local airline routes within the Soviet Union for several years after the end of the war, before its replacement by the Antonov An-2.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The MCM design aesthetic is typically characterized by clean, simple lines, honest use of materials, and it generally does not include decorative embellishments. The term was employed as a style descriptor as early as 1948 by the department store Strawbridge & Clothier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n\nThe Mid-Century Modern movement in International and Bauhaus movements, including the works of Gropius, Florence Knoll, Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Although the American component was slightly more organic in form and less formal than the International Style, it is more firmly related to it than any other. Brazilian and Scandinavian architects were very influential at this time, with a style characterized by clean simplicity and integration with nature. Like many of Wright's designs, Mid-century architecture was frequently employed in residential structures with the goal of bringing modernism into America's post-war suburbs. This style emphasized creating structures with ample windows and open floor plans, with the intention of opening up interior spaces and bringing the outdoors in. Many Mid-century houses utilized then-groundbreaking post and beam architectural design that eliminated bulky support walls in favor of walls seemingly made of glass. Function was as important as form in Mid-century designs, with an emphasis placed on targeting the needs of the average American family.\nIn Europe, the influence of Le Corbusier and the CIAM resulted in an architectural orthodoxy manifest across most parts of post-war Europe that was ultimately challenged by the radical agendas of the architectural wings of the avant-garde Situationist International, COBRA, as well as Archigram in London. A critical but sympathetic reappraisal of the internationalist oeuvre, inspired by Scandinavian Moderns such as Alvar Aalto, Sigurd Lewerentz and Arne Jacobsen, and the late work of Le Corbusier himself, was reinterpreted by groups such as Team X, including structuralist architects such as Aldo van Eyck, Ralph Erskine, Denys Lasdun, Jørn Utzon and the movement known in the United Kingdom as New Brutalism.\n\nPioneering builder and real estate developer Joseph Eichler was instrumental in bringing Mid-century modern architecture (\"Eichler Homes\") to subdivisions in the Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay region of California, and select housing developments on the east coast. George Fred Keck, his brother Willam Keck, Henry P. Glass, Mies van der Rohe, and Edward Humrich created Mid-century modern residences in the Chicago area. Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House is extremely difficult to heat or cool, while Keck and Keck were pioneers in the incorporation of passive solar features in their houses to compensate for their large glass windows.\n\nThe city of Palm Springs, California is noted for its many examples of Mid-century modern architecture.\n\nArchitects include:\n\n\n\nExamples of 1950s Palm Springs motel architecture include Ballantines Movie Colony (1952) – one portion is the 1935 Albert Frey San Jacinto Hotel – the Coral Sands Inn (1952), and the Orbit Inn (1957). Restoration projects have been undertaken to return many of these residences and businesses to their original condition.\n\nScandinavian design was very influential at this time, with a style characterized by simplicity, democratic design and natural shapes. Glassware (Iittala – Finland), ceramics (Arabia – Finland), tableware (Georg Jensen – Denmark), lighting (Poul Henningsen – Denmark), and furniture (Danish modern) were some of the genres for the products created. In America, east of the Mississippi, the American-born Russel Wright, designing for Steubenville Pottery, and Hungarian-born Eva Zeisel designing for Red Wing Pottery and later Hall China created free-flowing ceramic designs that were much admired and heralded in the trend of smooth, flowing contours in dinnerware. On the West Coast of America the industrial designer and potter Edith Heath (1911–2005) founded Heath Ceramics in 1948. The company was one of the numerous California pottery manufacturers that had their heyday in post-war US, and produced Mid-Century modern ceramic dish-ware. Edith Heath's \"Coupe\" line remains in demand and has been in constant production since 1948, with only periodic changes to the texture and color of the glazes.\n\nPrinted ephemera documenting the mid-century transformations in design, architecture, landscape, infrastructure, and entertainment include mid-century linen post cards from the early 1930s to the late 1950s. Mid-century linen post cards came about through innovations pioneered through the use of offset lithography. The cards were produced on paper with a high rag content, which gave the post card a textured look and feel. At the time this was a less expensive process. Along with advances in printing technique, mid-century linen postcards allowed for very vibrant ink colors. The encyclopedic geographic imagery of mid-century linen post cards suggests popular middle class attitudes about nature, wilderness, technology, mobility and the city during the mid-20th century.\n\nCurt Teich in Chicago was the most prominent and largest printer and publisher of Linen Type postcards pioneering lithography with his \"Art Colortone\" process. Other large publishers include Stanley Piltz in San Francisco, who established the \"Pictorial Wonderland Art Tone Series\", Western Publishing and Novelty Company in Los Angeles and the Tichnor Brothers in Boston. The printing of mid-century linen post cards began to give way in the late 1950s to Kodachrome and Ektachrome color prints.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired on Teletoon in Canada and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom (incomplete run). It is a co-production between Hat Trick Productions in the UK and Decode Entertainment in Canada. It was originally to be entitled \"Streatham Hill\", but was renamed \"Bromwell High\" in January 2005. Streatham Hill is a real London suburb, while Bromwell is fictional.\n\nSubsequent international purchases have seen the show screened in the United States on BBC America, on The Box in the Netherlands, dubbed to Spanish and Portuguese on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in Latin America, on the ABC in Australia, on TVNZ's TV2 in New Zealand, and also dubbed in French for the Canadian Télétoon network.\n\nIt stars three troublemaking girls: Keisha, Latrina, and Natella, as they wreak havoc on their impoverished school and its teachers.\n\nThe show was designed by David Whittle, who is also responsible for illustrating the popjustice icons series of books.\n\nThe show represents a caricatured view of contemporary British society. For example, the majority of students at Bromwell High School are immigrant children from the Caribbean and Asia, and some of the male teachers are aging 'chavs'. Many of the characters on the show speak a very poor form of English, including the headmaster, Iqbal. Most of the teachers have an affinity for biscuits.\n\nBecause the show was intended for both British and Canadian audiences, the characters sometimes use Canadian terms which are different from those heard in Britain. This can sometimes confuse viewers, especially on the occasions when Bromwell is referred to as a \"public school\"; in Canada, this means a provincial school, open to non-fee paying students, but in the UK, the term refers to a fee-paying, private school which attends the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. In fact, Bromwell would be correctly termed as a state school in Britain.\n\nThere are some other differences between the UK and Canadian versions of the show, notably that the UK version has a longer and slightly different version of the opening credits and theme, and the UK broadcasts were in the 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio, while the Canadian versions are cropped to a 4:3 picture.\n\nThe show is directed by Pete Bishop (who also directed and co-created with Steven Appleby and Frank Cottrell-Boyce the Captain Star TV series) and was created by Anil Gupta, Richard Osman, Richard Pinto, and Sharat Sardana (with Osman, Pinto and Sardana also contributing as writers to the show).\n\n\nFive years before his appointment at Bromwell High, Iqbal had escaped from Parkhurst where he was serving time for an unspecified crime. He subsequently met Mr. Bibby in Angola where they operated a diamond smuggling business together and \"dabbled\" in human trafficking. After being forced to leave Africa in a U.N. helicopter gunship, Iqbal arrived in England with nothing but the shirt on his back, a faded five pound note in his pocket, and a Bedford van's exhaust chamber full of state-of-the-art hydroponic equipment and marijuana seeds with the potential street value, when cultivated, of £80,000 (equal to £81,000 today). With these simple tools, he ran a mini-cab company and built an empire that today covers many thousand square feet.\n\nAlthough he had no formal academic qualifications (he does not believe in science, which he calls \"hocus-pocus\"), Iqbal rose quickly through the ranks to become Headmaster on the night he won Bromwell High in a poker game.\n\nSince he began his tenure, Bromwell High has consistently succeeded in avoiding closure — testament, surely to the quality of leadership he had provided.\n\nGregarious and larger than life, Iqbal is not a conventional Headmaster by any stretch. His language is colourful though his understanding of basic grammar is non-existent. He tries to make money any way he can, which often involves illegal and unethical practices. He holds very long meetings and assemblies that are often filled with irrelevant and/or ridiculous anecdotes or performances (known unofficially as \"Item 53\", due to the fact that in each episode the bizarre story/act is promptly followed by Iqbal saying \"Next on our list, item 54...\"). He can be manipulative and cocky but beneath the rough exterior lurks a conscience, and occasionally Iqbal surprises everyone with (rare) moments of humanity and pastoral excellence.\n\nIqbal's Bromwell High file number is 1. He is voiced by Simon Greenall (of \"I'm Alan Partridge\" fame).\n\nRoger Bibby read geography at Oxford University, where he won a Greco-Roman wrestling scholarship and had to pick an \"academic\" subject to graduate in.\n\nIn his first year, Mr. Bibby came under the spell of an emeritus professor whose study he accidentally wandered into one night thinking it was his own bed. It turned out that it was his own bed and that the \"professor\" was quite seriously mental. That night, a friendship began that eventually resulted in Mr. Bibby becoming a geography teacher.\n\nMr. Bibby is the Deputy Head of Bromwell High and the Geography teacher. Extremely articulate and knowledgeable, he has a very professional bearing. However, he is very stern and insensitive, and sometimes evil just for the sake of being evil (he has been known to be friendly with demons, and with Iqbal has links with the slave trade and diamond smuggling in Angola). In one episode he slapped Iqbal in the face just for crying. He is extremely manipulative, and therefore able to commit unethical acts with the Headmaster's consent.\n\nLike the Headmaster, he is insatiably greedy and tries to make money through unethical practices. However, unlike the Headmaster, he is far more calculated when he implements his plans.\n\nMr. Bibby's Bromwell High file number is 159. He is voiced by Graeme Garden (of \"The Goodies\" fame).\n\nMartin read mathematics at Cambridge though he never graduated. He was physically and sexually abused by his tutor, the head of the mathematics department, the rest of the mathematics department, the rowing club, the varsity football and rugby teams and the Christian society.\n\nHe spent three years as a research project for the School of Medicine—his blood pressure was found to be high enough to clean car wheels. He did not die, he only whined continuously. Research on Martin led to the development of Prozac.\n\nDespite the fact that he was, and still is, the only mathematics teacher in the school, it took Martin five years to gain promotion to Head of Mathematics Department. His teaching has been described by Ofsted as 'cocking shite'.\n\nMartin must always be watched. He has the kind of nervous disposition exhibited by people who take high-velocity rifles up clock towers to pick off passers-by. He is a spineless, ineffectual teacher who hates children, his job, and himself. In his late thirties, he is cripplingly middle-class and hides it by living in a Victorian terraced house in the shadow of a council estate in southeast London. He is the bane of Carol's life.\n\nWhen he teaches he does not discipline his students when they act contemptuously. He is also extremely neurotic, and panics at the thought of anything going wrong for him. He does not have a proper teaching qualification; only a certificate in plumbing technology. He often cheats on his wife, Carol Jackson, although he claims that \"using a prostitute is not cheating.\"\n\nWhen Martin messes up or does something wrong he often hits himself on the head and says \"fuck\" even when students are present.\n\nIqbal's nickname for him is \"Mongo\" (a variant of \"mong\", an offensive term implying mental retardation, derived from the original name given to Down's syndrome).\n\nHe was born Martin Shitely but took his wife's surname after marriage.\n\nMartin's Bromwell High file number is 657. He is also voiced by Simon Greenall.\n\nCarol graduated from \"Hedgehog College, University of the Lake District\", then attended teacher-training college at the \"Above Burger King School of Teaching\", Oxford Street, London.\n\nShe then spent five years at the Amnesty International London office, waiting outside the main entrance. Nobody let her in but she did receive free psychiatric help and eventually accepted that she didn't work for Amnesty International and was in fact a nut.\n\nShe later met and married Martin Shitely, who took her name.\n\nCarol is now an English teacher at Bromwell. She is in her 30s, wears organic clothes, and reads the Guardian. Carol understands people of all races and creeds except her husband Martin. She is discontented with the lack of intimacy and romance in her marriage; this is probably why she competes with Melanie Dickson for the attention of handsome men. She usually responds to Martin doing something stupid or wrong with \"Oh, Martin, you idiot.\"\n\nCarol's Bromwell High file number is 287. She is voiced by Doon Mackichan (from \"Smack the Pony\").\n\nMiss Dickson graduated from the \"University of Pudwacker Salt Flats\" with a First Class Honours degree in Chemical Biology.\n\nShe immediately gained bar work in London and very quickly rose up the ranks to become Bar Manager of \"Alcoholiday\", an Aboriginal-themed bar in London's Leicester Square.\n\nShe moved to Bromwell High thinking it was another themed bar, but within a year she realised that she was Head of Sciences at an inner-city school.\n\nShe is an attractive but very rude woman who shows a lack of proper teaching skills. She often taunts and teases people who aren't as pretty as she is, especially Carol.\n\nOriginally from Australia, Miss Dickson now teaches all the subjects at Bromwell that nobody else will (History/Science/Music/Etc.) - very poorly. She seldom cares about the subjects she teaches and even chain smokes during class. She competes with Carol Jackson for the affections of handsome men, mainly because she has an insatiable libido.\n\nMelanie's Bromwell High file number is 349. She is voiced by Tracy-Ann Oberman.\n\nMr. Phillips grew up in the quiet, crack-addled village of Chomping Frenum on England's west coast. He went missing at age 10, after chasing a worm into the forest. He strayed into an army firing range and was hit by three medium-sized surface-to-air missiles. Fortunately they passed straight through his skull, but he lost 80 percent of his brain matter.\n\nOn his way to an interview for a post at Bromwell High, Mr. Philips was caught in the crossfire of a gang-war shoot-out and lost 80 percent of his remaining brain matter.\n\nMr. Philips is Bromwell High's Physical Education teacher. He is often unaware of his surroundings or current situation, and is therefore utterly ineffective as a teacher. Iqbal refers to him as \"the stupid one\".\n\nMr. Phillips' Bromwell High file number is 999. He is voiced by Stephen Merchant.\n\nGavin was born in a crossfire hurricane. His mother was a tailor and his father was a gambling man. These circumstances made him turn to Christianity, which he hoped would provide some stability in his life.\n\nHe studied Theology at Durham University where he obtained a trombone scholarship.\n\nHe was ready to enter the church by 1990, in a poor east London parish where he felt he could help ease the suffering and assist the poverty stricken. He decided to defer a year and backpack around Thailand instead.\n\nHe claims to have written the novel \"The Beach\", the manuscript of which he says he left in a Bangkok dance bar, possibly in a Bangkok dancer. No one believes him because he has absolutely no proof and is generally considered to be \"a lying twat\".\n\nReturning to the poverty-stricken East End parish, he was struck by how disgusting it was so he got a job teaching.\n\nGavin is now the Religious Education teacher at Bromwell High (he considered being a journalist for NME but became a Christian Fundamentalist without having to change his taste in acoustic-based rock). He acts casual in an effort to connect with his pupils, but this is a thinly-veiled attempt to convert his students to Christianity. He consistently offends followers of all other faiths.\n\nGavin's Bromwell High file number is 742. He is voiced by Stephen Mangan.\n\nMs. Gosby graduated from Oxford Mobile University in 1986. There are no records of her before this. There are, however, records for a Mr. Bruce Gosby, who seems to have vanished during his gap year before attending university.\n\nBruce was an accomplished rower who took first place in both coxless events. He enjoyed being coxless, as if he were waiting all his life to be without cox.\n\nAfter teacher training, \"Ms.\" Gosby taught sciences to inmates of Lezzborough Prison, Little Beanflick, Dykeshire. She was dismissed after her involvement in a rooftop protest.\n\nConvicted of inciting a riot, Ms. Gosby was tagged by the police and considered dangerous and psychologically unstable.\n\nShe has since been appointed to Head of Biology at Bromwell High, and is also the lunchlady.\n\nOther characters have hinted that she might be transgender.\n\nMs. Gosby's Bromwell High file number is 123.\n\nConsidered \"cool\" and attractive by many of the girls within Bromwell High. Although he is depicted as being intelligent, he is usually rebellious within school and rude to teachers and prefects alike. During the episode \"1x06: Valentines's Day\", the girls of Bromwell High witnessed him placing a valentine's card into Keisha's and Natella's box. It remains the episode's plot to see who the card is meant for. Although Davis and Aisha have many similarities, Davis has never mentioned that he likes Aisha. His \"cool\" status comes from his contempt for teachers and his skills in speaking. He is also apparently quite attractive.\n\nDavis' best friend, although he is considerably less popular with the girls of Bromwell High. He is also considerably less intelligent, but less rebellious in school. Latrina has mentioned that she made out with Jamal.\n\nT'Shawn is incredibly short and has a high-pitched voice. He is also depicted constantly wearing an orange jacket, regardless of location, weather, and temperature. These three qualities make him horribly unpopular with the children of Bromwell High. It has been established he has feelings of affection for Keisha, although she strongly dislikes him. T'Shawn's catchphrase is, \"Oh, baby!\"\n\nSimilar to Jamal and Davis, Aisha and Belisha are best friends. Aisha is large, strong, and constantly has an angry expression, so is feared by many Bromwell High students. Most of her bullying comes from intimidation, and not actual physical violence. Aisha strongly dislikes Natella and all of her noble causes.\n\nBelisha is loud and brash. Unlike her best friend Aisha, she does not bully students exclusively through intimidation. She is quite willing (even happy, it seems) to physically harm students and damage property. Although she is relatively slim and only slightly tall, she is feared by all the girls, for she is very violent, and more than willing to fight (it can only be assumed that she is quite experienced in a fight, to make up for her small figure). She sometimes tries to outwit Miss Dickson into dismissing school early.\n\nKylie is a shy girl with bright red hair and bad acne. She is viewed as unpopular with the students of Bromwell and is picked on by Keisha, Aisha, Belisha, and many of the teachers.\n\nA representative of the LEA (Iqbal believes this to be a secret organization, and her name to be Pussy Aplenty). She is rather cruel and manipulative individual, using the school, pupils and staff for her own and the LEA's rather shadowy ends.\n\nIn December 2005 a DVD release in Australia featured the first five episodes out of sequence, i.e.: \"Tolerance\", \"Keisha's in Love\", \"Police Story\", \"No More Teachers\" and — billed as a \"bonus\" - \"Fire Drill\". The DVD received an 'M' censor rating, and of the five episodes on it, only \"Keisha's in Love\" and \"No More Teachers\" were screened in the UK. No further episodes were released in Australia.\n\nA UK DVD release was originally planned for early 2006 - in connection with which a 15m 23s \"Making of Bromwell High\" short was certified by the British Board of Film Classification as a '15' on 31 January 2006 - but was subsequently cancelled. The thirteen episodes were certified as '15' on 30 August 2006, apart from \"Keisha's in Love\", which was classified as a '12', for the release of the complete series as a two-disc set on 2 October 2006. This release contains all 13 episodes (seven of which have never aired in the UK, and which appear on the second disc erroneously labelled as \"Season Two\"), and extras include the previously-prepared \"Making of Bromwell High\" short, deleted scenes and outtakes, commentary on the episode \"Sweets\", and the original animatic storyboard for \"Baby Boom\".\n\nAn uncensored Canadian DVD set was released on 19 August 2008 from Phase 4 Films / kaBOOM! Entertainment as \"Bromwell High - The Complete Season\" (\"Polyvalente Baptiste Huard - La Saison Complète\" in French). It featured all episodes on two discs, with a rating of 18A under the Canadian Home Video Rating System.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835471", "title": "Unity candle", "text": "Unity candle\n\nA unity candle is a candle used in a wedding ceremony to symbolize two people joining in marriage.\n\nThe lighting of a \"unity candle\" is a relatively new custom in wedding ceremonies. There is no record of it in the bible or any Apostolic writings. The custom first became popular in the second half of the 20th century in American Christian weddings. The origins are unclear, however the use of a unity candle in a 1981 episode of General Hospital may have helped to popularize the practice.\n\nUse of a unity candle generally symbolizes the joining of two individuals into the marriage bond, but additional allusions may be invoked. The flame may be said to represent the passion in each individual's soul for their spouse. For Christians, it may be compared to the Holy Spirit and Jesus, who is the light of the world, within the souls of those who are baptized.\n\nTwo taper candles are initially lit and used by each member of the marrying couple. These tapers are then used to light a larger pillar candle in the center. Variations may include additional tapers used by parents to light the tapers that represent the individuals being married.\n\nWhen the practice is intended to symbolize simply the joining together of the bride and groom, the tapers may be blown out, to indicate that the two lives have been permanently merged, or they may remain lit beside the central candle, symbolizing that the now-married partners have not lost their individuality.\nWhile the use of unity candles within the marriage rite has become widespread, it is a recent invention and not explicitly part of the Churches Apostolic Tradition and therefore prohibited in some churches. It is advisable that couples and their Wedding planner should always check with the pastor before including the ceremony in their order of service.\n\nThe Candle Ceremony is not part of the Anglican wedding ceremonies, although it may be allowed at the discretion of the pastor.\n\nThe Unity Candle Ceremony is not part of the Catholic Wedding Ceremony. Catholic Tradition, instead, sees the regular reception of the Holy Eucharist as the heart of Christian Unity. The recently updated Catholic Rite of Marriage does not include any provisions for the Unity Candle Ceremony. For this reason, many parishes do not allow its inclusion in the ceremony. While the US Conference of Catholic Bishops has not explicitly prohibited the use of the unity candle in the marriage rite, neither has it encouraged the practice. The Conference has noted that the policies of most dioceses do not prohibit this custom but many suggest that it be done at the reception since the Rite of Marriage already has abundant symbols of unity. The analysis of the Bishops regarding unity candles concludes by indicating that if the unity candle is permitted, the couple should light their individual candles from the paschal candle, the individual candles should not be extinguished and the unity candle should not be placed on the altar. By following this direction, the lighted candles can then be seen as a way of emphasizing the couple's union in the sacramental and vocational nature of their marriage. \n\nIn the Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church, a marriage is sacramental in nature when the couple are both baptized Christians. This fact can help to give a more Christian interpretation of the Unity Candle, especially in a mixed marriage between a Catholic and a Christian of another Tradition. It is desirable at a Catholic Wedding for Holy Communion to be distributed. However, given that Holy Communion is not encouraged at a mixed Wedding, where one of the spouses together with a large part of the congregation is not Catholic, the use of a Unity Candle might be employed as a sign of the baptismal unity of the couple.\nSince in the rite of baptism, the lighted Paschal Candle and a smaller candle plays an important symbolic part. In the baptism rite, the Pascal Candle is placed near the font. After the person has been baptized with water, another smaller candle is lit by a Godparent from the flame of the Paschal Candle and given to the newly baptized as a sign that they have received the \"light of Christ\". They are instructed to keep the \"flame\" they have received to \"keep burning brightly\" until the return of the Lord (Parousia). This call to vigilance is a reference to the discipleship nature of baptized Christians who are called to evangelize through their vocational calling. The fact that each of the couple shares the same light signifies the unitive nature of their Christian vocation. St. Paul expresses the evangelizing nature of Christian marriage in his letter to the Ephesians 5:22-33. He says \"Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord\" and \"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her\" \n"}

{"id": "1835482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835482", "title": "Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station", "text": "Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station\n\nThe Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station is a nuclear power plant on the shore of Lake Erie near Monroe, in Frenchtown Charter Township, Michigan on approximately 1,000 acres. All units of the plant are operated by the DTE Energy Electric Company and owned (100 percent) by parent company DTE Energy. It is approximately halfway between Detroit, Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio. It is also visible from parts of Amherstburg and Colchester, Ontario as well as on the shore of Lake Erie in Ottawa County, Ohio along with \nOhio Turnpike. Two units have been constructed on this site. The first unit's construction started on August 4, 1956 and reached initial criticality on August 23, 1963, and the second unit received its construction permit on September 26, 1972. It reached criticality (head on) in June 21, 1985 and was declared commercial on November 18, 1988. The plant is connected to two single-circuit 345 kV Transmission Lines and three 120 kV lines. They are operated and maintained by ITC Transmission.\n\nThe plant is named after the Italian nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, most noted for his work on the development of the first nuclear reactor as well as many other major contributions to nuclear physics. Fermi won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity.\n\nOn October 5, 1966, Fermi 1, a prototype fast breeder reactor, suffered a partial fuel meltdown, although no radioactive material was released. After repairs it was shut down by 1972.\n\nOn August 8, 2008, John McCain was taken on a 45-minute tour of the plant, becoming the first actively campaigning presidential candidate to visit a nuclear plant.\n\nThe 69 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor Fermi 1 unit was under construction and development at the site from 1956 to 1963. Initial criticality was achieved on August 23, 1963. On October 5, 1966 Fermi 1 suffered a partial fuel meltdown. Two of the 92 fuel assemblies were partially damaged. According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no abnormal radioactivity released into the environment.\n\nFermi 1 was a liquid metal (sodium) cooled fast breeder reactor design. It was capable of producing 200 megawatts thermal (MWt) power or 69 MW electrical power with 26% enriched metallic uranium fuel. The enriched uranium section of the reactor (core) was a 30 inch in diameter cylinder by 30 inches high and contained 92 fuel assemblies. The core was surrounded by 548 additional assemblies containing depleted uranium. These assemblies were about 2.5 inches square by about 8 feet tall. Only the core section contained the enriched uranium while depleted uranium was placed above and below within the assemblies. The core also contained 2 control rods and 8 safety rods. The plant was designed for 430 MWt and 125 MWe using a newer uranium oxide fuel, but the plant was closed before the fuel was ever ordered.\n\nThe shield plug was a rotating part of the inner reactor vessel and sat over the fuel. It could be rotated in order to facilitate fuel movements. The shield plug also provided radioactive shielding. During fuel loading, new assemblies were lowered down a tube into an adjacent Transfer Rotor which was integral with the reactor vessel. Then an Offset Handling Mechanism lifted the assembly from the Transfer Rotor and placed it into the vessel. Once all of the assemblies were loaded, a Hold Down Mechanism sat atop them so as to prevent them from moving upwards during operation. The Hold Down Mechanism also contained temperature measuring devices (resistance temperature detectors) to monitor sodium outlet temperatures from the assemblies.\n\nThe (primary) sodium which flowed through the core exchanged heat with a secondary sodium system which then exited the containment. The secondary sodium then passed through the tube side of 3 parallel steam generators and transferred heat to water on the shell side. The “once through” design produced superheated steam which turned the main turbine-generator.\n\nA 168 MWe oil-fired boiler was added in 1966 to utilize the turbine-generator during periods when the reactor was not producing power.\n\nThe main cause of the partial meltdown was due to a temperature increase caused by a blockage in one of the lower support plate orifices that allowed the flow of liquid sodium into the reactor. The blockage caused an insufficient amount of coolant to enter the fuel assembly; this was not noticed by the operators until the core temperature alarms sounded. Several fuel rod subassemblies reached high temperatures of around (with an expected range near 580 °F, 304 °C), causing them to melt.\n\nFollowing an extended shutdown that involved fuel replacement, repairs to vessel, and cleanup, Fermi 1 restarted in July 1970 and reached full power. Due to lack of funds and aging equipment, it was finally shut down permanently on November 27, 1972, and was officially decommissioned December 31, 1975 under the definition of the Atomic Energy Commission. Later, the Nuclear Energy Commission replaced the AEC and under their new definitions, Fermi was re-designated as being in SAFSTOR due to some remaining radioactivity at the site. On May 16, 1996, decommissioning was restarted. However, by November 2011 with very little activity remaining, a decision was made to halt further work. It is currently in SAFSTOR.\n\nA number of accounts of the accident are available. One book is \"Fermi-1 New Age for Nuclear Power\" and published by the American Nuclear Society in 1979. A book, \"We Almost Lost Detroit\", was written by local Detroit newsman John Grant Fuller (subtitled \"This Is Not A Novel\" to point out that it was not a work of fiction). The song \"We Almost Lost Detroit\", by Gil Scott-Heron is also about the Fermi 1 meltdown.\n\nFermi 2 is a 1,202 MWe General Electric boiling water reactor owned and operated by DTE Energy. Plans to build were announced in July 1968. Initial criticality was achieved in July 1985, and full commercial operation commenced on January 23, 1988.\n\nThe reactor vessel holds 764 fuel assemblies and 185 control rods which modulate the power. The fuel assemblies are about 6 inches square by about 12 feet long. The turbine generator is an English Electric unit, but the company changed its name to General Electric Company later. Water flowing through the reactor vessel changes to saturated steam and then travels to the main turbine-generator to produce electricity. After that, the steam drops into a main condenser where it is condensed to liquid water and is recycled. A secondary loop of water which enters the tube side of the condenser is non-radioactive. It flows to two large cooling towers which stand 400 feet tall where the hot water is cooled by natural circulation with ambient air. This is a closed loop with only a small amount of make-up water needed from Lake Erie to replace any evaporation.\n\nTwo 345 kV lines send power to the customers. Those same lines are used to supply electricity to the site's safety equipment. Three additional 120 kV lines are also available to supply any needed back-up power to safety equipment. Additionally, four diesel generators and four combustion turbine generators are on site to power plant safety equipment during an emergency.\n\nThe original Fermi 3 project was to be a companion unit identical to Fermi 2. It was ordered in 1972 and cancelled in 1974. See DOE data page 67 and WNA Fermi 3 data.\n\nIn September 2008, Detroit Edison filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a Combined Construction and Operating License (COL) for a third reactor. The new unit is supposed to be built on the same site, slightly to the southwest of Fermi 2. The reactor design selected is the 1,550 MWe GE-designed passive Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR). Review of the 17,000-page application could take four years, after which construction could take six years. The cost is estimated at as much as $10 billion. CEO Anthony Earley said that DTE's analysis \"so far shows that nuclear power will, over the long term, be the most cost-effective baseload option for our customers, ... We expect nuclear to remain the low-cost option, but we will continue to evaluate nuclear against other resources and will commit to proceeding with construction only at the right time and at the right cost\".\n\nIn March 2009, a coalition of citizen groups asked federal regulators to reject plans for Fermi 3, contending that it would pose a range of threats to public health and the environment. The groups have filed 14 contentions with the NRC, claiming that a new plant would pose \"radioactive, toxic and thermal impacts on Lake Erie's vulnerable western basin.\"\n\nIn May 2015, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a combined construction and operating license for Fermi 3, but DTE Energy stated there were no plans for construction at that time.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Enrico Fermi was 4,799,526, a decrease of 3.4 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. Cities within 50 miles include Detroit (30 miles to city center) and Toledo (27 miles). Additional population within 50 miles is in Canada, including Windsor, Ontario, 26 miles.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 2010 estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Fermi was 1 in 238,095 making it the 88th least likely to be damaged of all US nuclear generating stations.\n\nThe Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station consists of one operational reactor, one closed unit and one additional is planned.\n\n"}

At its height in the 1880s, it was a gold and silver mining town with a population of around 2,500 and approximately 75 businesses.\n\nSilver City served as county seat of Owyhee County from 1867 to 1934. Today, the town has about 70 standing buildings, all of which are privately owned. Many of the owners are third- or fourth-generation descendants of the original miners. There are a handful of small businesses, but no gas or service stations. The property is now owned by the federal government, overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. \nSilver City was founded in 1864 soon after silver was discovered at nearby War Eagle Mountain (elev. ). The settlement grew quickly and was soon considered one of the major cities in Idaho Territory. The first daily newspaper and telegraph office in Idaho Territory were established in Silver City. The town was also among the first places in present-day Idaho to receive electric and telephone service. Along with Idaho City in the Boise Basin, these mining areas accelerated the growth of the capital city of Boise as a staging and supply point.\n\nThe placer and quartz vein mines became depleted around the time Idaho became a state in 1890. Due in part to its extremely remote location, Silver City began a slow decline but was never completely abandoned. Small-scale mining continued off and on until World War II; the last mine to be operated all year round in Silver City was the \"Potossi,\" managed by Ned Williams. By the 1940s, there was only one permanent resident, Willie Hawes (1876–1968), who was born in town and was its mayor, police chief, fire chief, postman, etc.\n\nThe Idaho Hotel in Silver City was restored and re-opened for tourists in 1972.

The small flowers can be greenish or white and are borne in racemes. The fruit is light green, ovoid, curved, up to 15 cm long, almost hollow (except for the seeds and a thin flesh layer), with smooth skin or sometimes covered in soft spines; the seeds are black.\n\"Cyclanthera pedata\" is grown at small scale farming in mountain areas of Mexico, Central America and South America. It is sometimes cultivated in Asia. This species can be grown in mountain areas up to 2000, being adapted to cool temperatures.\"\"\n\nKnown in the Andes as \"caigua\" or \"caihua\" (possibly from Quechua \"kaywa\"); also as \"achocha\" (possibly from Quechua \"achuqcha\"). In English it is named \"stuffing cucumber\" or \"slipper gourd.\"\n\nThe fruits are eaten after removing the seeds and stuffing them with other foods like rice or meat, and then cooking them. Young shoots and leaves can also be eaten as greens. The fruits are a source of potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. Fruit flavor might be similar to cucumber or otherwise tasteless.\n\nThe fruits contain flavonoid glycosides of which four show an antioxidant effect.\n\nCaigua fruits generally exhibit high antioxidant activity but a low total phenolic content, which indicates that non-phenolic water-soluble compounds might be involved. Flavonoids are present in this cyclanthera species, which have antioxidant properties as well and were shown that with a high intake are correlated to a decrease in heart disease.\n\nDried samples of caigua showed α-amylase inhibition and relevant ACE inhibitory activities.\n\nA negative aspect of caigua is, that the seeds contain a group of trypsin inhibitors, which negatively affect protein absorption.\n\nOther chemicals in the Caigua include triterpenoid saponins and the seeds have been reported with six cucurbitacin glycosides. as well as 28-30 amino acids.\n\nThe Moche culture often depicted this species in their ceramics. Remains of this species have also been found buried in archaeological sites on the Peruvian coast.\n"}

The Museum celebrated its centenary in March 2010, after extensive renovations.\n\nThe museum is home to exhibitions and collections of various species of sea fauna (starfish, seahorses, turtles, jellyfish, crabs, lobsters, rays, sharks, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, eels, cuttlefish etc.). The museum's holdings also include a great variety of sea related objects, including model ships, sea animal skeletons, tools, weapons etc., as well as a collection of material culture and ritual objects made from, or integrating materials such as pearls, molluscs and nacre.\n\nAt the first floor, \"A Sailor’s Career\" showcases the work of Prince Albert I.

Due to falling electricity prices resulting from the falling price of natural gas, the plant ceased operation May 7, 2013.\n\nThe plant's original operator was Wisconsin Public Service and it was owned by Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (59%) and Alliant Energy (41%). From 2000 to July 2005, the plant was operated by Nuclear Management Company, of Hudson, Wisconsin. The plant is now owned by Dominion Resources of Richmond, Virginia. In 2008, Dominion applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an extension of its operating license for an additional 20 years. The license was extended until 2033.\n\nOn April 27, 2006, there was a small water leak at the plant, though no radioactive material was released.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, Dominion Resources announced they would shut down and decommission the plant in mid-2013. Dominion's chairman and CEO said \"the decision was based purely on economics. Dominion was not able to move forward with our plan to grow our nuclear fleet in the Midwest to take advantage of economies of scale\". Lower natural gas costs and resultant lower electricity prices created an electricity market in which the plant could not compete. The plant came offline permanently on May 7, 2013. Plans for decommissioning are uncertain: as a private owner rather than a public utility, Dominion cannot rely on charges imposed on utility customers by state regulators; however, the firm has a substantial reserve fund earmarked for this purpose and a cause of action against the Department of Energy for failure to remove spent fuel. There is also the chance that the energy market might improve due to economic or political changes.\n\nThe SAFSTOR (SAFe STORage) nuclear decommissioning option was selected. During SAFSTOR, the de-fuelled plant is monitored for up to sixty years before complete decontamination and dismantling of the site, to a condition where nuclear licensing is no longer required. During the storage interval, some of the radioactive contaminants of the reactor and power plant will decay, which will reduce the quantity of radioactive material to be removed during the final decontamination phase. A reduced workforce will move fuel assemblies from the reactor into the spent fuel pool.\n\nThis plant has one Westinghouse pressurized water reactor. The plant has two 345 kV lines interconnecting it to the grid with one going to We Energies North Appleton Substation located north of Appleton, Wisconsin and the other one interconnecting with the Point Beach Nuclear Generating Station located just a short distance away. Two 138 kV lines exit the plant which go to the Green Bay area away.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.\n\nThe 2010 U.S. population within of Kewaunee was 10,292, a decrease of 0.9 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com.

From his mother, he was descendant of Date Masamune, Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. He rose to power as \"daimyō\" of the domain of Satsuma only after surviving a gruesome and arduous war within his own family and domain, known as the \"Oyura Sōdō\" or the \"Takasaki Kuzure\". He faced much opposition in Satsuma since he spent most of his life in Edo (and compulsory requirement as the heir of daimyo, set by the Shogunate); as such he was considered a stranger in his own domain. In his quest to prepare Satsuma for potential Western aggression, he also faced many opposing military schools of thought in Satsuma who disagreed with the Shimazu family's plan for strengthening coastal defense.\n\nNariakira did not see eye to eye with his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father's chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho also saw many similarities in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had a great interest in Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain's financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira's ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho's mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma's affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma's officials or their dealings with the shogunate.\n\nAnother formidable and dangerous obstacle for Nariakira in not only his plans to bolster the defenses of all of Japan but also his ascendancy to \"daimyō\" of Satsuma was Yura, the mother of his half-brother, Hisamitsu. By the time Nariakira had arrived in Satsuma to address a crisis related to the Ryūkyū Kingdom (a vassal state under Satsuma) in 1846, Yura had used her charm to thoroughly convince Narioki to promote the interests of her son Hisamitsu over Narioki's legitimate son and heir-apparent (Nariakira). Zusho, Narioki, Yura, and Hisamitsu were the key members of the coalition which rallied other Satsuma bureaucrats who felt threatened by Nariakira's immense and highly intimidating intelligence, and tried to impede all attempts Nariakira made to retire his father as \"daimyō\" and take his place.\n\nNariakira arrived in Satsuma to attempt to resolve the Ryūkyū crisis, as per the orders of shogunal high official Abe Masahiro, on June 25, 1846. A French ship had arrived in Ryūkyū in 1844, and two British ships the following year, demanding treaties of amity and commerce; as the kingdom was semi-independent and not generally regarded to be part of Japan proper, this presented a dilemma. Nariakira and Abe Masahiro decided in the end that, despite the shogunate's policies of seclusion, such relations should be allowed in Ryūkyū, rather than risking violent conflict with the Western powers.\n\nOn March 8, 1847, Narioki arrived in Satsuma, making Nariakira's position, something equivalent to deputy to his father, obsolete. After essentially having the reins of power wrenched from his hands by his own father, Nariakira left Satsuma for Edo. The authority formerly vested him was clearly and quickly being shifted to his half brother, Hisamitsu Hisamitsu was rapidly elevated through the ranks of his father's court soon after Nariakira's departure from Satsuma for Edo. He was placed in charge of the newly created office of military service of Satsuma in October 1847. In 1848, Narioki appointed Hisamitsu steward of Chosa District, with the responsibility of acting on behalf of the \"daimyō\" in all military matters in the area. At about the same time, Hisamitsu was given the highly respected post of \"han\" councilor, a rank which, according to the instructions accompanying the appointment, placed him at the top of the social scale. At ceremonial occasions, Hisamitsu was ordered by his father to sit at a place higher than that of the deputy in charge of the \"daimyō\" of Satsuma's castle. Narioki even went so far as to place Hisamitsu in charge of all of Satsuma whenever the \"daimyō\" chose to leave Satsuma for any reason, business or pleasure. It was apparent that Hisamitsu was being groomed to become the next \"daimyō\", completely disregarding the fact that, by primogeniture, Nariakira was supposed to be the heir-apparent.\n\nTo further discredit and impede Nariakira's rise to lord of Satsuma, Yura was rumored to have asked at least five spiritual leaders to cast spells on Nariakira's eldest sons as well as take other measures to curse Nariakira's children. Many of Nariakira's followers believed Yura was the source of the subsequent deaths of his eldest children. This belief caused many of them to call for the assassination of Yura, her son Hisamitsu, and Zusho, whom they felt also played a hand in the deaths of Nariakira's eldest children. Nariakira was able to restrain them; upon hearing of their plans for murder, Narioki began rooting out Nariakira's supporters and ordering their deaths by \"seppuku\".\n\nThe conflict had gotten so far out of hand that Nariakira was left with no choice but to request aid from Abe Masahiro. Abe, seeing that Nariakira was being hindered in his proceeding with the Ryūkyū crisis by his own father and family retainers, aided in getting Narioki to retire and removing Zusho.\n\nAbe first went about the task of removing Zusho, who was greatly relied upon by Narioki, by inviting him to Edo. Abe's stated purpose was a desire to discuss the Ryūkyū crisis and its current handling. In the process of the conversation, Abe began to ask Zusho a line of questioning that made it apparently clear to Zusho that Abe, as well as the Tokugawa shōgun, knew the truth of the illegal Satsuma-Ryūkyū-Western trade relations, which were being carried out against the shogunate's policy of seclusion. Zusho's devotion to Narioki pushed him to take full responsibility for the illicit trade by committing \"seppuku\" on December 18, 1848. On December 3, 1850, Narioki was called to Edo by the shōgun and presented with a prized set of tea utensils, indicating the shōgun's desire for Narioki to retire. On February 3, 1851, Nairoki retired and Shimazu Nariakira was made \"daimyō\" of Satsuma.\n\nNariakira was considered one of the wisest \"daimyō\" of his time, thanks to his love of education. In order to better understand this point, his background and education must be considered.\n\nIn 1812, at age three, Nariakira was designated the heir to the Satsuma lordship by his father. As with any \"daimyō’s\" heir, Nariakira was prepared for his future role, by receiving a well-rounded education in the martial and scholarly arts. As stated above, Nariakira shared his grandfather Shigehide's fascination with Western culture and learning. The young Nariakira was fascinated by his grandfather's collection of western items, which included clocks, musical instruments, telescopes, microscopes, and weapons. In the course of his education, he was also taught how to read and write Roman letters, and would later use Roman letters to write Japanese words as a personal form of code. Shigehide also introduced Nariakira to Philipp Franz von Siebold, a German physician serving as the director of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) in Nagasaki, making him one of the few Japanese to have actually met a Westerner.\n\nAfter he became \"daimyō\" of Satsuma, Nariakira had Minayoshi Hotoku, a Satsuma physician, to build the \"Iroha-maru\", one of the first Western-style ships built in Japan. It was based on Minayoshi's , model. Nariakira then built a shipyard for Western-style shipbuilding at Sakurajima. He carried his love of Western culture into the military of Satsuma where he implemented Western-style cavalry and demanded annual military field maneuvers. However, without the Satsuma budget that had been so carefully restored by his enemy Zusho, none of this would have been possible.\n\nHe also began enacting educational changes in Satsuma geared at bringing in Western science and technology. Nariakira established the \"Rangaku Koshujo\", a school for the study of the Dutch language and Western culture. He would frequently visit schools and ask students to explain the meaning of the Confucian texts, to ensure that their Western learning did not corrupt their sense of nationalism. So strong was Nariakira's desire to raise well-educated youths that he set aside four \"koku\" annually to feed starving scholars, essentially a form of financial aid or scholarship. His goal in promoting education in Satsuma was to make sure the youths of Satsuma were “taught to master themselves, rule their homes wisely, preserve national peace, and trust the universal power.”\n\nIn 1848, Shimazu obtained the first daguerreotype camera ever imported into Japan, and ordered his retainers to study it and produce working photographs. Due to the limitations of the lens used and the lack of formal training, it took many years for a quality photograph to be created, but on September 17, 1857, a portrait of Shimazu in formal attire was produced. This photograph became an object of worship in the (also referred to as Shōkoku Shrine) after Shimazu's death, but it later went missing. Lost for a century, the daguerreotype was discovered in a warehouse in 1975 and was later determined to be the oldest daguerreotype in existence created by a Japanese photographer. For this reason, it was designated an Important Cultural Property by the government of Japan in 1999, the first photograph ever given this honor.\n\nIn the course of his life, Nariakira made many friends in high places. These connections came in handy during his efforts to force the retirement of his father. Abe Masahiro, who at the time was a \"rōjū\", was one of these friends. Abe spoke on behalf of the Tokugawa \"shōgun\" in regards to Japan's national military defense and was the one who placed Nariakira in charge of Satsuma's dealing with the Ryūkyū Western Trade Treaty crisis.\n\nAbe, and indirectly, the Tokugawa \"shōgun\", were disturbed by Nariakira's removal from responsibility over the Ryūkyū Western Trade Treaty crisis because their policy concerning the crisis was predicated on their trust in him, not in his father or Zusho Hirosato. Narioki and Zusho had already proven themselves untrustworthy by not being completely reliable on matters concerning Ryūkyū. Abe knew that the only way Nariakira could gain control of the Ryūkyū crisis was if his father and Zusho were removed; through Abe's intervention, this too was accomplished.\n\nSince Narioki and Zusho together ceased the flow of information regarding Satsuma's officials or their dealings with Ryūkyū to Nariakira, Nariakira had to establish his own information-gathering network. He relied on Date Munenari of Uwajima to explain his predicament to the Tokugawa shogunate and Abe. He instructed his associates Yamaguchi Sadayasu and Shimazu Hisataka to gather information in Satsuma for him as well as keep a close watch on Zusho's activities with special emphasis on goods and money being brought into the domain. Nariakira then decided it was time to make his bid for the lordship of Satsuma. He relied on Date Munenari to report the situation for him and gain the sympathies of Abe. In a letter addressed to Date on August 27, 1848, Nariakira thanks him for obtaining Abe's assurance that he would overlook Nairoki and Zusho's transgressions and not take Satsuma to court as long as the Ryūkyū problem was resolved satisfactorily. Date's correspondence with Abe served to hasten Narioki's retirement and Nariakira's ascendancy as \"daimyō\" of Satsuma.\n\nOnce Nariakira became \"daimyō\", he needed loyal men to ensure that Yura and Narioki's continued efforts to undermine his power did not succeed. Saigō Takamori, a low-ranking Satsuma samurai, was promoted from assistant clerk, to Nariakira's attendant, in 1854. Ōkubo Toshimichi was exiled by Narioki for supporting Nariakira, but once Nariakira came to power he was pardoned and rose rapidly through the ranks. Saigō and Ōkubo worked on Nariakira's behalf, speaking with Nariaki, the lord of Mito to convince him to back Nariakira's view that government should have greater focus on the emperor and less on the \"shōgun\". Saigo and Ōkubo adopted many of Nariakira's views, which would later become the foundation of the new Meiji government. These views included centralizing the government around the emperor, and Westernizing the Japanese military.\n\nShortly before his death, Nariakira was left with only a two-year-old son (Tetsumaru) and eight-year-old daughter (Teruhime). He had been forced to ask Narioki to decide between Hisamitsu or Hisamitsu's son Tadayoshi to succeed him as \"daimyō\". Saigō and Ōkubo felt the death of all of Nariakira's viable heirs was caused by Yura and wanted retribution, but Nariakira would not allow it. On July 8, 1858, Nariakira was supervising the joint preparatory maneuvers in Tempozan for sending 3,000 Satsuma soldiers to Edo, and he succumbed to the heat. He was transported to Tsurumaru Castle, where he died on the 16th. A few years after his death, he was deified as a Shinto kami, Terukuni-daimyōjin. His son Tetsumaru died shortly after his father.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
