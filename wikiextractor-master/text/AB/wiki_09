It is a common unit process used in refineries, and is also used in petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants and other industries.\n\nProcesses within oil refineries or chemical processing plants that remove hydrogen sulfide are referred to as \"sweetening\" processes because the odor of the processed products is improved by the absence of hydrogen sulfide. An alternative to the use of amines involves membrane technology. However, membrane separation is less attractive due to the relatively high capital and operating costs as well as other technical factors.\n\nMany different amines are used in gas treating:\n\nThe most commonly used amines in industrial plants are the alkanolamines DEA, MEA, and MDEA. These amines are also used in many oil refineries to remove sour gases from liquid hydrocarbons such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG).\n\nGases containing or both and are commonly referred to as \"sour gases\" or \"acid gases\" in the hydrocarbon processing industries.\n\nThe chemistry involved in the amine treating of such gases varies somewhat with the particular amine being used. For one of the more common amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) denoted as RNH, the chemistry may be expressed as:\n\nA typical amine gas treating process (the Girbotol process, as shown in the flow diagram below) includes an absorber unit and a regenerator unit as well as accessory equipment. In the absorber, the downflowing amine solution absorbs and from the upflowing sour gas to produce a sweetened gas stream (i.e., a gas free of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) as a product and an amine solution rich in the absorbed acid gases. The resultant \"rich\" amine is then routed into the regenerator (a stripper with a reboiler) to produce regenerated or \"lean\" amine that is recycled for reuse in the absorber. The stripped overhead gas from the regenerator is concentrated and .\n\nAlternative stripper configurations include matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure with split feed. Many of these configurations offer more energy efficiency for specific solvents or operating conditions. Vacuum operation favors solvents with low heats of absorption while operation at normal pressure favors solvents with high heats of absorption. Solvents with high heats of absorption require less energy for stripping from temperature swing at fixed capacity. The matrix stripper recovers 40% of at a higher pressure and does not have inefficiencies associated with multipressure stripper. Energy and costs are reduced since the reboiler duty cycle is slightly less than normal pressure stripper. An Internal Exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to in the overheads stream, and therefore less steam is required. The multipressure configuration with split feed reduces the flow into the bottom section, which also reduces the equivalent work. Flashing feed requires less heat input because it uses the latent heat of water vapor to help strip some of the in the rich stream entering the stripper at the bottom of the column. The multipressure configuration is more attractive for solvents with a higher heats of absorption.\n\nThe amine concentration in the absorbent aqueous solution is an important parameter in the design and operation of an amine gas treating process. Depending on which one of the following four amines the unit was designed to use and what gases it was designed to remove, these are some typical amine concentrations, expressed as weight percent of pure amine in the aqueous solution:\n\nThe choice of amine concentration in the circulating aqueous solution depends upon a number of factors and may be quite arbitrary. It is usually made simply on the basis of experience. The factors involved include whether the amine unit is treating raw natural gas or petroleum refinery by-product gases that contain relatively low concentrations of both HS and CO or whether the unit is treating gases with a high percentage of CO such as the offgas from the steam reforming process used in ammonia production or the flue gases from power plants.\n\nBoth HS and CO are acid gases and hence corrosive to carbon steel. However, in an amine treating unit, CO is the stronger acid of the two. HS forms a film of iron sulfide on the surface of the steel that acts to protect the steel. When treating gases with a high percentage of CO, corrosion inhibitors are often used and that permits the use of higher concentrations of amine in the circulating solution.\n\nAnother factor involved in choosing an amine concentration is the relative solubility of HS and CO in the selected amine. The choice of the type of amine will affect the required circulation rate of amine solution, the energy consumption for the regeneration and the ability to selectively remove either HS alone or CO alone if desired. For more information about selecting the amine concentration, the reader is referred to Kohl and Nielsen's book.\n\nMEA and DEA are primary and secondary amines. They are very reactive and can effectively remove a high volume of gas due to a high reaction rate. However, due to stoichiometry, the loading capacity is limited to 0.5 mol CO per mole of amine. MEA and DEA also require a large amount of energy to strip the CO during regeneration, which can be up to 70% of total operating costs. They are also more corrosive and chemically unstable compared to other amines.\n\nIn oil refineries, that stripped gas is mostly HS, much of which often comes from a sulfur-removing process called hydrodesulfurization. This HS-rich stripped gas stream is then usually routed into a Claus process to convert it into elemental sulfur. In fact, the vast majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and other hydrocarbon processing plants. Another sulfur-removing process is the WSA Process which recovers sulfur in any form as concentrated sulfuric acid. In some plants, more than one amine absorber unit may share a common regenerator unit. \nThe current emphasis on removing CO from the flue gases emitted by fossil fuel power plants has led to much interest in using amines for removing CO. (See also: Carbon capture and storage and Conventional coal-fired power plant.)\n\nIn the specific case of the industrial synthesis of ammonia, for the steam reforming process of hydrocarbons to produce gaseous hydrogen, amine treating is one of the commonly used processes for removing excess carbon dioxide in the final purification of the gaseous hydrogen.\n\nIn the biogas production it is sometimes necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the biogas to make it comparable with the natural. The removal of the sometimes high content of hydrogen sulfide is necessary to prevent corrosion of metallic parts after burning the bio gas.\n\nAmines are used to remove CO in various areas ranging from natural gas production to the food and beverage industry, and have been for over sixty years.\n\nThere are multiple classifications of amines, each of which has different characteristics relevant to CO capture. For example, Monoethanolamine (MEA) reacts strongly with acid gases like CO and has a fast reaction time and an ability to remove high percentages of CO, even at the low CO concentrations. Typically, Monoethanolamine (MEA) can capture 85% to 90% of the CO from the flue gas of a coal-fired plant, which is one of the most effective solvent to capture CO.\n\nChallenges of carbon capture using amine include:\n\nThe partial pressure is the driving force to transfer CO into the liquid phase. Under the low pressure, this transfer is hard to achieve without increasing the reboiler’s heat duty, which will result in higher cost.\n\nPrimary and secondary amines, for example, MEA and DEA, will react with CO and form degradation products. O from the inlet gas will cause degradation as well. The degraded amine is no longer able to capture CO, which decreases the overall carbon capture efficiency.\n\nCurrently, variety of amine mixtures are being synthesized and tested to achieve a more desirable set of overall properties for use in CO capture systems. One major focus is on lowering the energy required for solvent regeneration, which has a major impact on process costs. However, there are tradeoffs to consider. For example, the energy required for regeneration is typically related to the driving forces for achieving high capture capacities. Thus, reducing the regeneration energy can lower the driving force and thereby increase the amount of solvent and size of absorber needed to capture a given amount of CO, thus, increasing the capital cost.\n\n\n"}

His ubiquitous late-night infomercials, which promoted unsubstantiated health, diet, and financial advice, earned him a fortune but eventually resulted in civil and criminal penalties for fraud, larceny, and contempt of court.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Trudeau was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud. In 1998, he was accused of grossly misrepresenting the contents of his book, \"The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\". In a 2004 settlement, he agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and cease marketing all products except his books, which are protected under the First Amendment. However, in 2011, he was fined $37.6 million for violating the 2004 settlement, and ordered to post a $2 million bond before engaging in any future infomercial advertising. In 2013, facing further prosecution for violations of the 2011 agreement and non-payment of the $37-million judgment, Trudeau filed for bankruptcy protection. His claims of insolvency were challenged by FTC lawyers, who maintained that he was hiding money in shell companies, and cited examples of continued lavish spending, such as $359 for a haircut.\n\nIn November 2013, Trudeau was convicted of criminal contempt, and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. He will be eligible for release in 2022.\n\nInfomercials starring Trudeau and promoting his books — under the auspices of a private California corporation of undisclosed ownership — continue to air regularly on United States television stations.\n\nTrudeau grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts, the adopted son of Robert and Mary Trudeau. He attended St. Mary's High School in Lynn, where he was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" by the class of 1981.\n\nAfter high school Trudeau became a used car salesman, then joined the seminar circuit, selling memory improvement techniques. In 1990 he pleaded guilty to depositing $80,000 in worthless checks and impersonating a physician, but served, he said, fewer than 30 days. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of credit card fraud and spent two years in federal prison. After his release in 1993, Trudeau joined a multi-level marketing firm, Nutrition for Life. The firm was successful until the Attorney General of Illinois charged that it was running a pyramid scheme. Trudeau and Nutrition for Life settled cases brought by the state of Illinois, and seven other U.S. states, for US$185,000.\n\nNext, Trudeau produced and appeared in a series of late-night television infomercial broadcasts throughout North America. They promoted a range of products, including health aids, dietary supplements (such as coral calcium), baldness remedies, addiction treatments, memory-improvement courses, reading-improvement programs, and real estate investment strategies. The FTC took regulatory action against Trudeau, alleging that his broadcasts contained unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations. In 1998, he was fined. In 2004, he settled a contempt-of-court action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payments of a $2 million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote any product other than publications protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIn 2004, Trudeau began writing books and promoting them with infomercials in the U.S. The first book he published was a medical guide titled \"Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\", which was published in 2005. The book was criticized for containing no natural cures. Trudeau claimed that he was not able to include them because of threats by the FTC. The book became a bestseller selling 5 million copies.\n\nTwo years later, Trudeau published a second medical book titled \"More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease\" (). According to Trudeau, the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses. Trudeau's books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop degenerative conditions like cancer or Alzheimer's disease, and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria, but rather by an imbalance in vital energy. Science writer Christopher Wanjek critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his July 25, 2006 LiveScience.com health column.\n\nTrudeau went on to publish \"The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\" and \"Debt Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\". His writing has been commercially successful if not factual. In September 2005, \"Natural Cures\" was listed in the \"New York Times\" as the number-one-selling nonfiction book in the United States for 25 weeks.\n\nTrudeau launched a self-titled Internet radio talk show in February 2009 which also aired on several small radio stations consisting of mostly brokered programming.\n\nTrudeau has been married at least three times. Little is known about his first marriage, to Oleksandra Polozhentseva, a Ukrainian immigrant. His second union, in 2007, to Kristine Dorow, a Norwegian student whom he met in London, ended in annulment after four months. In 2008 he married Natalya Babenko, another Ukrainian, who currently runs several of his former companies. She has returned to her home in Kiev, according to Trudeau.\n\nIn 2004, Trudeau self-published his book \"Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\", in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims—for example, that sunlight does not cause cancer, sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer, and that AIDS was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage. Trudeau further suggested—again without documentation—that various \"natural cures\" for serious illnesses, including cancer, herpes, arthritis, AIDS, acid reflux disease, various phobias, depression, obesity, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, attention deficit disorder, and muscular dystrophy, had been deliberately hidden from the public by the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and the major food and drug companies. In one widely quoted example, he asserted that the University of Calgary had developed a \"natural\" diabetes treatment, then quashed its data, fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry. (A spokesman for the school told ABC News that \"there have been no human studies conducted at the University of Calgary in the past 20 years on herbal remedies for diabetes.\" The university later sent Trudeau a \"cease and desist\" letter, ordering him to stop using its name.) Rose Shapiro cited \"Natural Cures\" as a prime example in her book, \"Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All\".\n\n\"Natural Cures\" sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion. Quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was \"misleading\". In a 2005 public warning from the New York State Consumer Protection Board, CPB Chairman Teresa A. Santiago cautioned that \"Natural Cures\" contained no actual cures, only \"speculation\". Cures were promised, but only by subscribing to Trudeau's newsletter or website at $71.40 per year or $499 for a \"lifetime membership\". The paid sites contained only additional, similarly unsubstantiated speculation, according to the CPB. The \"Chicago Tribune\" also noted that a purported back-cover endorsement by former FDA commissioner Herbert Ley—who died three years before the book was written—was actually an excerpt from a 35-year-old \"New York Times\" interview.\n\nFollowing \"Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\", Trudeau released a second medical guide two years later. His second book was self-published as well and titled \"More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease.\"\n\nThe book is a similar publication to his first, where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth about how their products can cause disease. In \"More Natural Cures Revealed\", Trudeau writes that workers at the FDA and FTC want to censor him and, figuratively, burn his books. Though the book received negative comments from some reviewers, it received average ratings on both Amazon and GoodReads.com.\n\nIn April 2007, Trudeau released \"The Weight Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\". The book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by British endocrinologist ATW Simeons in the 1950s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin. The diet was criticized in 1962 by the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" as hazardous to human health and a waste of money. In 1976, the FTC ordered clinics and promoters of the Simeons Diet and hCG to inform prospective patients that there had not been \"substantial evidence\" to conclude hCG offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet. Clinical research trials published by the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that hCG is ineffective as a weight-loss aid, citing \"no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups\" and that hCG \"does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction.\"\n\nThe FTC has filed a contempt-of-court action against Trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a 2004 consent order.\n\n\"Debt Cures\" was published in 2007 and has been marketed on television. Chuck Jaffee, a columnist at CBS MarketWatch, stated: \"Truth be told, most of the information (in the book) is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library.\" Trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports, they can dispute them as identity theft; this was the \"magic cure\" of the book's title.\n\nPublished in 2009, the product says it gives tools on how to use the Law of Attraction to manifest readers' desires. The packaging also says it contains key links to using the Law of Attraction that are missing in other publications. Among the claims made in the related infomercial is Trudeau's assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school. He also says he was \"taken in\" by a mysterious group called \"The Brotherhood\" that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book. There is also an invitation to join the now defunct \"Global Information Network,\" an \"exclusive group of highly influential, affluent, and freedom-orientated [sic] people\" (see below). The network operated out of the Caribbean island Nevis and employed the Law of Attraction as its principal wealth generator, a concept generally regarded by much of the scientific community as placebo or pseudoscience.\n\nTrudeau has been interviewed by CNN's Paula Zahn, Matt Lauer of NBC's \"Today Show\", and Harry Smith of CBS's \"The Early Show\". Trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by \"Inside Edition\", ABC's \"20/20\" and \"Dateline NBC\". The \"20/20\" segment highlighted a \"Nightline\" interview with Jake Tapper in which Trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government, the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges, and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by Tapper.\n\nAt one time, Trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials. He consented to an FTC ban applying to everything except publications that the FTC concluded would infringe upon his First Amendment rights. All of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books \"Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You To Know About\" and \"The Weight Loss Cure\". Notable co-hosts included Leigh Valentine (former wife of televangelist Robert Tilton) and the late Tammy Faye Messner (the former Tammy Faye Bakker).\n\nTrudeau offers a conspiracy theory, saying that the drug industry and the FDA work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning all-natural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry. Trudeau says that FDA commissioners who leave the FDA to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars. In any other industry, according to Trudeau, this would be called \"bribery,\" a \"conflict of interest\" or \"payoffs.\" Trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals (such as MSG and aspartame) to get people \"addicted to food\" and to \"make people obese.\"\n\nOne of the major complaints about Trudeau's infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies, making them impossible to cross-check for accuracy. The same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence that he presents in the infomercials. He does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods. For example, he tells a story in an infomercial about \"a friend from England\" who came to his house and complained of heartburn. He also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of St. John's Wort compared to two prescription medications. These studies, the infomercials suggest, are identified in the book being advertised for sale, but none of his books provide any such substantiation. In an interview, he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of \"FTC suppression\"; but readers can join his web site, where, for $9.99 a month or $499 for a lifetime, they can gain access to the special members-only section from which they can e-mail him for the information.\n\nA pair of 2005 Associated Press articles by Candice Choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs. Choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him, Trudeau \"anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory\" and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials. Trudeau's use of the word \"cure\" is an issue for regulators. Also, bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial self-published book.\n\nTrudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create \"Mega Memory\" and \"Advanced Mega Memory\" audio tapes. His promotion of memory-enhancing products was ended by the intervention of the Federal Trade Commission which alleged that the claims made by Trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a \"photographic memory,\" as the advertising claimed.\n\nTrudeau used research that Dr. Michael Van Masters conducted with the State School for the Blind in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1975 as the basis of the \"Mega Memory\" products. Trudeau was selling automobiles at Neponset Lincoln Mercury in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston in 1982 when he first met Van Masters. Shortly after meeting Van Masters, Trudeau joined Van Masters in the memory business in Chicago. \n\nIn addition to \"Natural Cures\", Trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the \"Perfect Lift\" non-surgical facelift. In the United Kingdom, this infomercial was found to violate the ITC advertising rules.\n\nIn 2008, Trudeau began airing another infomercial, for a product called Firmalift, with Leigh Valentine.\n\nOn September 11, 2006, Donald Barrett and ITV Direct, a direct marketing company based in Beverly, Massachusetts, announced that they had partnered with Trudeau to market both of his \"Natural Cures\" books. Trudeau also worked with ITV to create ITV Ventures, a new MLM group based out of ITV's home office. As of December 2006, ITV Direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and Trudeau's books from its corporate website; however, the infomercials continued to run for several years thereafter.\n\nIn 2005, Trudeau founded the International Pool Tour (IPT). His goal was to transform billiards into a \"major league\" sport with aggressive promotion and the largest purses ever offered. The initial three events in 2005 and early 2006 were successful, but at the fourth, the IPT World Open tournament in Reno, Nevada, promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse. Winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments, but most were never paid. The Reno fiasco marked the demise not only of IPT but of professional pool competitions as a whole. As one commentator put it, \"The pool hustler wasn't murdered by any single suspect, but the last man holding the knife was Kevin Trudeau.\"\n\nIn connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuits. Trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the United States government for making claims without evidence. In these cases, Trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine. Trudeau subsequently began to sell books, which are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nTrudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early 1990s. The FTC has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him. A court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service; however, he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to free-speech protection under the First Amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations. On November 19, 2007, a court found Trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book \"The Weight Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\". In August 2008, he was fined more than $5 million<ref name=\"FTC 2008/10\">Kevin Trudeau Banned from Infomercials For Three Years, Ordered to Pay More Than $5 Million for False Claims About Weight-Loss Book, Federal Trade Commission, October 6, 2008.</ref> and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book. The amount of the monetary damages was later increased to $37 million.\n\nIn 1990, Trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit $80,000 in false checks, and in 1991, he pleaded guilty to larceny. That same year, Trudeau faced federal charges of credit card fraud after he stole the names and Social Security numbers of eleven customers of a mega memory product and charged $122,735.68 on their credit cards. He spent two years in federal prison because of this conviction. Later, in an interview, he explained his crimes as:\n\nTrudeau began working for Nutrition For Life, a multi-level marketing program, in the mid-1990s. In 1996, his recruitment practices were cited by the states of Illinois and Michigan, as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Illinois sued Trudeau and Jules Leib, his partner, accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. They settled with Illinois and seven other states for $185,000 after agreeing to change their tactics. Michigan forbade him from operating in the state. A class action lawsuit was filed by stockholders of Nutrition for Life for violations of Texas law, including misrepresenting and/or omitting material information about Nutrition for Life International, Inc.'s business. In August 1997, the company paid $2 million in cash to common stockholders and holders of warrants during the class period to settle the case. The company also paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees of $600,000.\n\nIn 1998, Trudeau was fined $500,000, the funds to be used for consumer redress by the FTC, relating to six infomercials he had produced and in which the FTC determined he had made false or misleading claims. These infomercials included \"Hair Farming,\" \"Mega Memory System,\" \"Addiction Breaking System,\" \"Action Reading,\" \"Eden's Secret,\" and \"Mega Reading.\" The products included a \"hair farming system\" that was supposed to \"finally end baldness in the human race,\" and \"a breakthrough that in 60 seconds can eliminate\" addictions, discovered when a certain \"Dr. Callahan\" was \"studying quantum physics.\"\n\nIn June 2003, the FTC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Trudeau and some of his companies (Shop America (USA), LLC; Shop America Marketing Group, LLC; and Trustar Global Media, Limited), alleging that disease-related claims for Coral Calcium Supreme were false and unsubstantiated. In July 2003, Trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for Coral Calcium Supreme and Biotape.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, the court found Trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction, because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims. The court ordered Trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products.\n\nIn September 2004, Trudeau agreed to pay $2 million ($500,000 in cash plus transfer of residential property located in Ojai, California, and a luxury vehicle) to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called Biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain. He also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials, but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials. Trudeau was the only person ever banned by the FTC from selling a product via television. Lydia Parnes, speaking for the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection stated: \"This ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled American consumers for years.\" Trudeau claimed the government was trying to discredit his book because he was \"exposing them.\"\n\nOn February 28, 2005, Trudeau filed a complaint against the FTC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which the court denied.\n\nThe complaint charged that the FTC had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the 2004 Final Order. That conduct, Trudeau asserted, exceeded the FTC's authority under 15 U.S.C. § 46(f) and violated the First Amendment. The FTC responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nThe district court granted the FTC's motion to dismiss. First, the court concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the press release was not \"a 'final agency action'\" under \"section 704 of the [Administrative Procedure Act]\", 5 U.S.C. § 704. Second, the court held, \"in the alternative, that Trudeau's claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law.\"\n\nTrudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the court's ruling.\n\nTrudeau filed a lawsuit on August 11, 2005, accusing the New York State Consumer Protection Board of violating his First Amendment rights by contacting television stations in New York state and urging them to pull Trudeau's infomercials promoting his book \"Natural Cures \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\". Trudeau won a temporary restraining order on September 6, 2005 prohibiting the Board from sending letters to the television stations. The temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction. However, Trudeau lost a motion to have the Board send a \"corrective letter\" to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages. The case is still in litigation.\n\nThe FTC filed a contempt of court action against Trudeau and the companies that market \"The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About\", alleging that Trudeau was in contempt of a 2004 court order by \"deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weight-loss protocol that is 'easy' to follow.\" The action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on September 17, 2007. According to an FTC press release, Trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy, can be done at home, and readers can eat anything they want. When consumers buy the book, they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting, daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable, and lifelong dietary restrictions.\n\nOn November 19, 2007, Trudeau was found in contempt of the 2004 court order for \"patently false\" claims in his weight loss book. U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Gettleman ruled that Trudeau \"clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book, and by doing so, he has misled thousands of consumers.\"\nOn August 7, 2008, Gettleman issued an order that Trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest, for three years from the date of the order; and was to pay a penalty of $5,173,000, an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book.\nOn November 4, 2008, Gettleman amended the judgment to $37,616,161, the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials. The court denied Trudeau's request to reconsider or stay this ruling on December 11 of the same year.\n\nTrudeau appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which upheld the contempt finding, but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the $37,616,161 damage finding and the three-year infomercial ban. After the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding, and set a $2 million performance bond for future infomercial advertising, Trudeau again appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the damage award on November 29, 2011.\n\nOn February 11, 2010, Trudeau was arrested and appeared in U.S. District Court before Gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he \"asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the Federal Trade Commission.\" He was forced to turn over his passport, pay a $50,000 bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court. On February 17, Gettleman sentenced Trudeau to 30 days in jail and forfeiture of the $50,000 bond. Psychiatrist Stephen Barrett, the creator of Quackwatch.org, \"has for years labeled Trudeau a fraud\" and was quoted: \"He struck me as somebody who (believes he) is omnipotent. That is, no one can touch him,\" Barrett said. \"That's almost been the case.\" Trudeau appealed the ruling and on May 20 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted his motion, dismissing the contempt citation.\n\nOn November 28, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported. The HCG diet was popularized by Trudeau's \"The Weight-Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\" book in 2007.\n\nOn Nov. 29, 2011, Trudeau lost his 2010 appeal in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The court found that the $37.6 million fine for violating his 2004 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission was appropriate as Trudeau had aired 32,000 infomercials and described the figure as \"conservative.\" The court considered sales only from the 800 number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales. Additionally, the court found that requiring Trudeau to make a $2 million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional.\n\nIn September 2013, Judge Robert Gettleman held Trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the $37 million fine assessed in 2010. Noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle, despite insisting that he had been \"completely wiped out\" financially, Gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog Trudeau's assets and holdings. A month later Trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receiver's investigation. In November a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his 2004 agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals. Pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk, and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets.\n\nIn February 2014, the court-appointed receiver announced that a number of Trudeau's known assets, including a home in Ojai, California, would be auctioned, with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitution. The receiver also assumed control of Trudeau's Global Information Network (GIN), the Nevis-based \"secret club\" that had promised extraordinary \"secrets to success\". Court officials informed GIN members that the club's business model \"likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme\", and that its relentlessly publicized group of 30 billionaire financial advisors known as the \"GIN Council\" did not exist. GIN's remaining assets were later auctioned as well.\n\nIn March 2014, Trudeau was sentenced to 10 years in prison, an \"unusually lengthy\" term for a contempt conviction. Judge Ronald Guzman, \"visibly irritated\" by Trudeau's plea for leniency, described him as \"deceitful to the core\". \"[Trudeau] has treated federal court orders as if they were mere suggestions ... or at most, impediments to be sidestepped, outmaneuvered or just ignored,\" Guzman said. \"That type of conduct simply cannot stand.\" Trudeau filed an appeal, contending that (a) Gettleman erred in ruling that Trudeau's misrepresentations of the content of \"Free Money \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\" was in contempt of the court's 2004 Order; (b) that the district court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay compensatory damages of $37.6 million; and (c) further abused its discretion when it amended its 2004 Order to prohibit him from participating in infomercials promoting his books. In February 2016, a federal appeals court found no basis to accept Trudeau's claims, and ruled that the 10-year sentence was reasonable, given \"the size of Trudeau's fraud and the flagrant and repetitive nature of his contumacious conduct.\"\n\nTrudeau is currently serving his sentence at the Federal Prison Camp Montgomery in Alabama. He maintains an active Facebook page, where he solicits donations for his \"defense fund\" and compares his imprisonment to that of Nelson Mandela.\n\nIn April 2014, Guzman ordered that royalties payable to Trudeau from continuing sales of his books—now owned by a California company called Free is My Favorite LLC, which purchased the rights from Trudeau—be forwarded to a government-controlled trust and used for fine and restitution payments. Infomercials for \"Free Money \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\", produced and marketed by Free is My Favorite LLC, continue to run on television stations throughout the United States. In October 2015, Gettleman approved a partial refund of about $8 million to more than 820,000 people who bought \"The Weight Loss Cure \"They\" Don't Want You to Know About\".\n\nOne common criticism by consumer groups is that Trudeau has had no medical training. Trudeau responds that by not having such training, he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the FDA, and that medical doctors \"are taught only how to write out prescriptions\" for \"poisons\" and \"cut out pieces of a person's anatomy.\"\n\nTrudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims. Although he recites anecdotes, he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners. In instances where Trudeau has been asked to provide proof, he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies. For example, Trudeau cited a nonexistent 25-year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the University of Calgary. When ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper confronted him on \"Nightline\", Trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it; he never did. He later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry. In 2006 University of Calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of Trudeau's claims about the university's research were true, and that its attorneys had sent Trudeau a \"cease and desist\" letter, demanding that he stop associating himself with the school.\n\nIn August 2005, the New York Consumer Protection Board warned consumers that Trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products, noting that the back cover of \"Natural Cures\" includes false endorsements. Further, the NYCPB states that Trudeau's television advertisements \"give the false impression that Tammy Faye Messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the 'natural cures' in Trudeau's book.\" A representative for Messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again.\n\nThe back cover includes the following quote from Dr. Herbert Ley, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who died three years before the book was written: \"The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing and what people think it's doing are as different as night and day.\" The statement, extracted from a 1969 interview in \"The New York Times\", was made in the context of Ley's resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes. Trudeau's lawyer, David J. Bradford, says that this quote does not constitute a false endorsement of the book by Ley, but rather is merely a statement that is in line with the purpose of the book.\n"}

{"id": "1925134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925134", "title": "Indo-European copula", "text": "Indo-European copula\n\nA feature common to all Indo-European languages is the presence of a verb corresponding to the English verb \"to be\". Though in some languages it is vestigial, it is present nonetheless in atrophied forms or derivatives.\n\nThis verb has two basic meanings: \n\n\nSome languages have shared these functions between several verbs: Irish, Spanish and Persian all have multiple equivalents of \"to be\", making a variety of distinctions. \n\nMany Indo-European languages also use the conjugations of the verb \"to be\" as an auxiliary for the formation of compound (periphrastic) tenses (\"I’m working\"; \"I was bitten\"). Other functions vary from language to language. For example, although in its basic meanings, \"to be\" is a stative verb, English puts it to work as a dynamic verb in fixed collocations (\"You are being very annoying\").\n\nThe copula is the most irregular verb in many Indo-European languages. This is partly because it is more frequently used than any other, and partly because Proto-Indo-European offered more than one verb suitable for use in these functions, with the result that the daughter languages, in different ways, have tended to form suppletive verb paradigms. \n\nThis article describes the way in which the irregular forms have developed from a series of roots.\n\nThe root \"*hes-\" was certainly already a copula in Proto-Indo-European.\n\nThe e-grade \"*hes-\" (see Indo-European ablaut) is found in such forms as English \"is\", Irish \"is\", German \"ist\", Latin \"est\", Sanskrit \"asti\", Persian \"ast,\" Old Church Slavonic \"ѥстъ (jestŭ)\".\n\nThe zero grade \"*hs-\" produces forms beginning with /s/, like German \"sind\", Latin \"sumus\", Vedic Sanskrit \"smas\", etc. \n\nIn PIE, \"*hes-\" was an athematic verb in \"-mi\"; that is, the first person singular was \"*hesmi\"; this inflection survives in English \"am\", Pashto \"yem\", Persian \"am\", Sanskrit \"asmi\", Bengali first-person verb ending -ām, Old Church Slavonic (\"esmĭ\"), etc.\n\nThis verb is generally reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European thus:\n\nThe root or (which did not have ablaut variations in the protolanguage) probably meant 'to grow', but also 'to become'. \n\nThis is the source of the English infinitive \"be\" and participle \"been\". Also, for example, the Scottish Gaelic \"future\" tense \"bithidh\"; the Irish imperative \"bí\", past \"bhí\" and future \"beidh\"; the Persian imperative \"bov\", past \"bud\" and future \"bâš\"; and the Slavic infinitive, etc. for example Russian (\"byt’\"). \n\nPIE became Latin /f/, hence the Latin future participle \"futūrus\" and perfect \"fuī\"; Latin \"fīō\" 'I become' is also from this root, as is the Greek verb (\"phúō\"), from which \"physics\" and \"physical\" are derived.\n\nThis verb can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nThe root \"*hwes-\" may originally have meant \"to live\". The e-grade is present in the German participle \"gewesen\", the o-grade (\"*wos-\") survives in English and Old High German \"was\", while the lengthened e-grade (\"*wēs-\") gives us English \"were\". (The Germanic forms with /r/ result from grammatischer Wechsel.) See Germanic strong verb: Class 5.\n\nThis has been claimed as the origin of the Old Norse and later Scandinavian languages' present stem: Old Norse \"em, ert, er, erum, eruð, eru\"; the second person forms of which were borrowed into English as \"art\" and \"are\". It has also been seen as the origin of the Latin imperfect (\"eram, eras, erat\") and future tenses (\"ero, eris, erit\").\n\nHowever, other authorities link these forms with \"*hes-\" and assume grammatischer Wechsel (/s/→/r/), although this is not normally found in the present stem. Donald Ringe argues that the copula was sometimes unaccented in Pre-Proto-Germanic, which would have then triggered the voicing under Verner's law. He explains the Germanic first person singular form as such, deriving it from earlier , since -zm-, but not -sm-, was assimilated to -mm- in Germanic (for which other evidence exists as well). Furthermore, the third person plural form (from PIE ) shows that this word, too, was unaccented. If the accent had been preserved, it would have become , but that form is not found in any Germanic language. In this view, it is likely that stressed and unstressed varieties of the copula (with corresponding voiceless and voiced fricatives) existed side by side in Germanic, and the involvement of a separate root \"\" is unnecessary.\n\nThe Latin forms could be explained by rhotacism\n\nThe root \"*(s)teh-\" meant \"to stand\". From this root comes the present stem of the so-called \"substantive verb\" in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, \"tá\" and \"tha\" respectively. On the absence of the initial s- in Celtic, see Indo-European s-mobile.\n\nIn Latin, \"stō, stare\" retained the meaning \"to stand\", until local forms of Vulgar Latin began to use it as a copula in certain circumstances. Today, this survives in that several Romance languages (Galician-Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan) use it as one of their two copulae, and there is also a Romance tendency for a past participle derived from \"*steh-\" to replace the original one of the copula (this occurs in French, Italian and the main dialects of Catalan). See also Romance copula.\n\nAlthough in Dutch, this verb retains its primary meaning of \"stand\", it is also used in an auxiliary-like function that only has a secondary meaning of \"standing\", for example: \"ik sta te koken\" (\"I am cooking\", literally \"I stand to cook\"). When it is not a full copula (it can normally only be used as an auxiliary with another verb), it does have shades of meaning that resemble that of the Italian \"sto cucinando\" (\"I am cooking\"). The intransitive verbs \"zitten\" (\"to sit\"), \"liggen\" (\"to lie\") and \"lopen\" (\"to walk/run\") are used in similar ways.\n\nGerman \"stehen\" also exhibits a similar secondary meaning as a copula in certain locative phrases. For example, \"Das Auto steht da\" (\"the car is over there\" lit. \"the car stands there\").\n\nIn Swedish, which usually lacks gerund forms, the corresponding \"stå\" is often used similarly, along with \"sitta\" (\"to sit\"), \"ligga\" (\"to lie\") and \"gå\" (\"to walk\").\n\nIn Hindustani the past tense of the copula \"honā\" \"to be\" is \"thā/e/ī\", derived from Sanskrit \"sthā\". Gujarati has a cognate verb \"thavũ\" \"to happen\"; cf. Bengali aorist \"thā-\" (to stay) as well.\n\nIn Persian \"istâdan\" means \"to stand\"\n\nThe Hittite verb \"to be\" is derived from the Indo-European root *\"\".\n\nThe Vedic Sanskrit verb \"as\" (to be) is derived from the Indo-European root *\"\".\n\n\"bhū\" (to be) is derived from Indo-European *\"\".\n\nIn modern Hindi, \"as\" has developed into the present indicative forms of the verb होना (\"honā\"). The infinitive itself is derived from \"bhū\".\n\nWith regard to the function of the verb ‘to be’ as a copula, the most conspicuous feature of Modern Persian language is the evolution of an \"existential be\", hast (exists), out of ast (is). In fact, when studying the forms and functions of ‘to be’, one might find certain characteristics specific to Persian that is worth pondering upon— i.e. even without considering the diachronic evolution of Modern Persian language and its relation to Ancient Iranian languages (such as Old Persian and Avestan) whose usage of the verb ‘to be’ seems more close to Sanskrit. Paradoxically, despite the fact that Persian is apparently the only Indo-European language that has created an \"existential be\" out of the copula, it has simultaneously made an extreme use of the latter to produce a general paradigm for conjugating all Persian verbs. Historically speaking, like most of Indo-European languages that make use of suppletive roots to denote ‘to be’, Persian integrates Proto-Indo-Eroupean (PIE) verbs *hes- (to be) and *buH (to grow> to become> to be). Hence, while Persian (Pers) infinitive būdan (to be) < PIE \"*buH\" forms the past stem of the verb (e.g. Pers būd- ‘was’) or acts as an auxiliary verb in formation of pluperfect of other verbs, its present tense is solely based on the derivatives of PIE *\"hes-. It is, in fact, from the declension of PIE *\"hes- (to be) that six present stems have been created and assigned to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person singular and plural to act as the present-tense conjugation of Pers būdan (to be), as shown in the following table. (NB 1. Modern Persian nouns and pronouns have no grammatical gender; thus, all pronouns are neutral, e.g. the language does not distinguish between ‘he’ or ‘she’. NB 2. In the conventional transliteration of Iranian languages: [x] is to be pronounced as \"ch\" in \"Bach\" or \"Loch Ness\"; [ā] as \"a\" in \"far\"; [ī] as \"ee\" in \"deed\"; [ū] as \"oo\" in \"food\", [š] as \"sh\" in \"she\", č as \"ch\" in \"chair\", [ž] as \"j\" in \"déjà vu\")\nAs an example, in the following sentences, the present forms of the verb 'to be' are used as copulas or predicates: ______________ \"\"man doxtar-e to am; īn barādar-e man ast (a or e); to pedar-e man ī \" ______________ (‘I am your daughter; this is my brother; thou art my father.’) Furthermore, as endings added to the stem of the verbs, these declensional forms have been grammatized to shape a general paradigm for the grammatical conjugation of all other verbs; as if any of these endings was once an auxiliary verb which evolved into an enclitic. This generalized conjugational paradigm is also applied to the past tense of the verb \"būdan\" (e.g. \"būd-am = literally: *‘\"(I) am was\"’→ ‘I was’; similarly \"būd-īm→ ‘we were’ etc.) (NB. An old declensional suffix -ad is still used instead of ast for 3rd person singular in present-tense and subjunctive conjugation of Persian verbs). However, what is linguistically notable, is the emergence of an \"existential be\" out of the \"copula\", viz hast (exists) out of ast '(is). The evolution of this exceptional form, might go back to ancient Iranian languages, where \"ast\" could have two variants (cf. Avestan which has both as- and has- <PIE *hes- ‘be’). In the next phase, what we may call a \"pseudo-verb appeared, vis. the verb \" هستن hastan (to exist) has been \"analogically\" evolved from hast (exists) and has been conjugated like any other Persian verb (e.g. \"hast-am = literally: *‘\"(I) am existence\"’→ ‘I exist’). Nevertheless, created out of a wrong re-analysis of hast (exists), the restrictions of this pseudo-verb would show up as soon as one tries to either find its past-tense and/or negate it. Then, \"hastan\" (to exist) will simply turn into the familiar past-tense or negation of the aforementioned verb \"būdan\" (e.g. \"būd-am ‘I was’ vs. \"na-būd-am ‘I was not’) which acts just as a copula and its existential meaning has to be inferred like English ‘to be’. We may therefore deduce that neither \"hast\" (exists) nor its derived pseudo-verb \"hastan\" (to exist) can be negated at all, unless reduced to copulas! In other words, we do not have *\"ni-hast\" (it does not exist), but *\"ni-ast\"> \"nīst\" (it is not) (despite the fact that there was once such a verb as \"(a)nihistan\" in Middle Persian (Pahlavi)). It is also worth mentioning that in the early stages of the Classic (Modern) Persian, \"ni-am\" was the only way to say ‘I am not’. However, following a secondary analogy (similar to \"hast\" [exists] → \"hastan\" [to exist]) a negative pseudo-verb \"nīstan\" (not to be) was invented. Therefore, the mirror image of the pseudo-verb \"hastan\" is not a negation of the existential verb, but just a simple \"negative copula\" formed from \"ast\" (is) → *\"ni-ast\"→ nīst (is not)> nīstan ‘not to be’ which, like \"hastan\", has only present-tense (e.g. \"nīst-am ‘I am not’). Finally, going back to the verb \"būdan\", there is no doubt that it can only act as a copula, even if we look at its other forms which, as a heritage of the ancient Persian, has provided such moods as optative bād [<\"bovād\" ‘May it be!’], (wish to be), the potential (mood of probability) bov-ad (might be), and perhaps subjunctive/ conditional/ imperative bāš. (NB. However, \"bāš\" may be from another PIE root *\"wes-\" cf. English \"was\"). In this regards, we may notice that the third person forms of \"bāš\" whose infinitive bāšīdan\" is conjugated to produce conditional, or substantial mood, has a tendency to replace \"ast\" (is), although considered wrong by educated/cultured Persians (e.g. \"ū mādar mī-bāš-ad\" [She is (a) mother.] instead of simply \"ū mādar ast\"). To summarize: As mentioned in the General Feature, the most significant point is that Persian grammar differentiates the marked or substantive form هست \"hast\" from copula است \"ast\". \"Hast\" is used to express existence while \"ast\" expresses predication. Of course in colloquial Persian, \"hastan\" can be also used for emphasis to express predication in the present tense. In the past tense, the verb بودن \"būdan\" covers both meanings.\n\nStrictly speaking, \"hastan\" is only a theoretical infinitive, not lexical. Therefore, \"būdan\" functions as the actual infinitive., used, for example, in past-tense as \"būd\" (was) and in present-tense modal \"bovad\" ‘it may be’. The circumstantial form of \"būdan\" is باش \"bāš\", used for the imperative and subjunctive, e.g. اگر باشد \"agar bāsh-ad\" 'if it is'.\n\nThe forms \"ast\" (is) and \"hast\" (exists) have been derived from the Indo-European root *', where \"būd\" (was) is derived from Indo-European *'.\n\nThe Ancient Greek verb \"eimi\" (I am) is derived from the Indo-European root *\"\".\nThe participles are based on the full-grade stem ἐσ- in Homeric, according to Smyth.\n\nExcept for Latin, the older Italic languages are very scarcely attested, but we have in Oscan \"set\" (they are), \"fiiet\" (they become), \"fufans\" (they have been) and \"fust\" (he will be), and in Umbrian \"sent\" (they are). This section will explain Latin, and the Romance languages that have evolved from it.\n\nIn Spanish, Catalan, Galician-Portuguese and to a lesser extent, Italian there are two parallel paradigms, \"ser/èsser/essere\" from Latin \"esse\" \"to be\" on one hand, and \"estar/stare\" from Latin \"stare\", \"to stand\" on the other.\n\nFor simplicity, the table below has only the full conjugation of the present tense, and the first-person singular forms of some other tenses.\n\nIn several modern Romance languages, the perfect is a compound tense formed with the participle as in English, but the old Latin perfect survives as a commonly used preterite in Spanish and Portuguese, and as a literary \"past historic\" in French, Italian and Catalan.\n\nThere is a tendency for a past participle derived from \"stare\" (or more specifically its supine, \"statum\") to replace that of the main copula derived from \"esse\". For example, the French participle \"été\" comes from \"statum\".\n\nFor further information, see the main Romance copula article.\n\nProto-Germanic retained the dual, but only in the first and second person.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Lithuanian, the paradigm \"būnu, būni, būna\", etc. is not considered archaic or dialectal but rather a special use of the verb \"būti\", to be, mostly used to describe repeated actions or states, or habits.\n\nIn the Celtic languages there is a distinction between the so-called substantive verb, used when the predicate is an adjective phrase or prepositional phrase, and the so-called copula, used when the predicate is a noun.\n\nThe conjugation of the Old Irish and Middle Welsh verbs is as follows:\nThe forms of the Old Irish present tense of the substantive verb, as well as Welsh \"taw\", come from the PIE root *\"stā-\". The other forms are from the roots *\"es-\" and *\"bhū-\". Welsh \"mae\" originally meant \"here is\" (cf. \"yma\" 'here').\n\nIn modern Gaelic, person inflections have almost disappeared, but the negative and interrogative are marked by distinctive forms. In Irish, particularly in the south, person inflections are still very common for the \"tá/bhí\" series.\n\nGaelic \"(bh)eil\" and Irish \"(bh)fuil\" are from Old Irish \"fuil\", originally an imperative meaning \"see!\" (PIE root \"*wel-\", also in Welsh \"gweled\", Germanic \"wlitu-\" \"appearance\", and Latin voltus \"face\"), then coming to mean \"here is\" (cf. French \"voici < vois ci\" and \"voilà < vois là\"), later becoming a suppletive dependent form of \"at-tá\". Gaelic \"robh\" and Modern Irish \"raibh\" are from the perfective particle \"ro\" (\"ry\" in Welsh) plus \"ba\" (lenited after \"ro\").\n\nThe present tense in particular shows a split between the North and the South. Though the situation is undoubtedly more complicated, King (2003) notes the following variations in the present tense as spoken (not as written according to the standard orthography):\nFor example, the spoken first person singular dw i'n is a contraction of the formal written yr ydwyf fi yn . The Welsh F /v/ is the fricative analogue of the nasal /m/, the PIE suffix consonsant for the first person singular.\n\nThe Classical Armenian present tense derives from PIE *'- (cf. sg. ', ', '; 3rd pl. \"\").\nThe Albanian copula shows two distinct roots. The present \"jam\" ‘I am’ is an athematic root stem built from PIE *'. The imperfect continues the PIE imperfect of the same root but was rebuilt based on the 3rd person singular and plural. The perfect, on the other hand, comes from the thematic aorist of PIE *'- ‘turn’ (cf. Ancient Greek \"épleto\" ‘he turned’, Armenian \"eɫew\" ‘he became’, Old Irish \"cloïd\" ‘turns back, defeats’). Analogical or otherwise indirect reflexes are italicized below.\n\n"}

The first flight to Lugano took place on November 3, 2003 with a Cirrus Airlines aircraft. In May 2004 the airline obtained its Air Operator's Certificate licence from the Federal Office for Civil Aviation of Switzerland (FOCA), allowing it to operate with its own aircraft - a 50-seat Dash 8-Q300 leased from the manufacturer, Bombardier Aerospace.\n\nBaboo was then able to acquire its own aircraft, two Dash 8-Q400 turboprops that formed the airline's fleet for the next five years. In 2007, Baboo was running out of capital and was sold to Lebanese Investment Group M1; among the major developments an equity increase amounting to 9.2 million Euros, which was subscribed in 2007, enabled the management to devise a sound growth strategy and to give the company a new dimension and corporate image. Julian Cook was then ousted from the company.\n\nThe company also ordered three Embraer E190 regional jets, which were to be delivered from April 2008. The airline announced routes to Kiev and St-Petersburg. By September 2008, the three aircraft had been delivered and Baboo announced new routes to Toulouse, Bordeaux, Athens, Bucharest and Zagreb from Geneva. However, the airline encountered problems with its two previously-announced routes: its flights to St-Petersburg were blocked by Russian authorities, whereas its flights to Kiev did not prove popular enough; as a result, neither route ever operated.\n\nAt the end of 2009 Baboo posted a turnover of 73 million Swiss francs. More than 1,300,000 passengers had been carried by that date. Baboo had codeshare agreements with TAROM, Air France-CityJet, Alitalia and Olympic Air.

These include the health impacts of smoking; the permissibility of smoking on holidays and fast days, and the impacts of second-hand smoke on other people.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, the use of tobacco for smoking and in the form of snuff was common among Jews. It is asserted that a Jew named Luis de Torres, who accompanied Christopher Columbus on his expedition in 1492, settled in Cuba, learned the use of tobacco, and introduced it into Europe. From this time Jews were connected with the trade in tobacco.\n\nAs early as the 17th century, rabbis debated various halachic issues which arose in connection with tobacco use, particularly its permissibility on Shabbat, holidays, fast days, and whether a blessing must be recited before use. Among the early sources are \"Keneset ha-Gedolah\" by R' Chaim Benveniste (1603–73) and \"Magen Avraham\" by Avraham Gombiner (1635–83).\n\nGombiner referred to the \"drinking of \"tobak\" [tobacco] through a pipe by drawing the smoke into the mouth and discharging it,\" and was undecided on whether a smoker should first make a blessing over smoking as a type of refreshment. Believing that tobacco was soaked in beer — a kind of \"chametz\" — he banned smoking during Passover.\n\nBenveniste expressed himself very forcibly against smoking \"tutun\" (tobacco) on Tisha BeAv, and reportedly excommunicated a Jew who smoked on that solemn fast-day. Benveniste pointed out the inconsistency of those authorities who permit smoking on holidays because it is a 'necessity,' a 'means of sustaining life,' and who allow it on fast-days because smoke has no 'substance' like food. In Benveniste's opinion, smoking was prohibited on holidays; he quoted Rabbi Joseph Escapa as coinciding in this view, though he thought it unwise to enforce a generally accepted law.\n\nWriting in Turkey, an Islamic country, Benveniste further argued that smoking on fast days is \"Chillul Hashem\" (a defamation of God's name), because Muslims refraining from smoking on fast-days would see Jews smoking on theirs. Despite such concerns, some Jews did smoke on Shabbat using hookas prepared before Shabbat, or else visited Muslim neighbors to enjoy the smoke in their homes. Rabbinic authorities banned this practice on the grounds that Gentiles would consider Judaism as ridiculous.\n\nThe Turkish narghile, in which the smoke passes through water, early became popular; Benveniste rules that the \"tumbak\" (cake of tobacco, over which a burning coal is placed at the other end of the narghile) extinguishes the fire, which is forbidden on holidays as well as Shabbat. Gombiner prohibits tumbak because it is like \"mugmar\" (spice for burning), mentioned in the Talmud, which likewise is prohibited. This, however, is disputed by R. who permits the use of the narghile on holidays. The controversy finally ended in a victory for those rabbis who permitted the use of tobacco on holidays and fast-days, except of course on Yom Kippur, which is like Sabbath; still, some Jews still abstain from smoking on Tisha BeAv.\n\nUnlike smoking, the use of snuff was allowed on the Sabbath, holidays, fast-days, and Yom Kippur. Jacob Hagiz (1620-74) quotes a responsum of Isaiah Pinto permitting the use of snuff on the Sabbath, even though it cures catarrh; for everybody, even healthy people, snuff, and it can not therefore be considered a drug.\nThe Chofetz Chaim (1838–1933) sought to dissuade practitioners from smoking. He considered it a waste of time, and saw the practice of people borrowing cigarettes from each other as morally questionable.\n\nR' Moshe Feinstein prohibited smoking in any place where other people are found, on the grounds that it causes them distress (even ignoring health impacts).\n\nThe early modern responsa literature addresses the question of students smoking in their \"batei midrash\" and synagogues. Some rabbis sought to outlaw smoking and the use of snuff in places of worship and posted notices for study halls. Many leading acharonim prohibited smoking in \"batei midrash\" and synagogues on the grounds that smoking is a frivolous activity which does not show respect for the holiness of these places.\n\nWhen 20th century medicine discovered the negative effects of smoking on health, the question arose whether smoking is forbidden in all circumstances. The debate about the acceptability of smoking according to \"halacha\" is centered primarily around the prohibition for a person to damage his body, or bring about his death.\n\nOpponents of smoking argue that since there is a clear link between smoking and cancer, smoking should be prohibited. However, Rabbi Moses Feinstein wrote a responsum stating that while inadvisable, smoking was permitted for one who had already started. Feinstein explained that since the risk of illness or death due to smoking is considered small, and it is a widespread practice, it is therefore permitted under the rabbinical principle: \"The Lord protects the simple.\" However, starting to smoke would be prohibited because of the transgression of v'lo sasuru. According to students, when informed of the dangers of smoking, Rabbi Aaron Kotler ruled that smoking was a biblical transgression. Many Haredi rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit'. These rabbis include Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman, Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Shapiro, Rabbi Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, and Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach. Rabbi Shmuel HaLevi Wosner forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke are obligated to do everything they can to stop. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.\n\nAmong important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Ben Tzion Abba Shaul and Rabbi Moshe Tzadka called on youth not to start smoking.\n\nOther major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, Rabbi Moshe Stern, and Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg.\n\nSmoking is specifically prohibited by Solomon Freehof, other Reform rabbis, as well as rabbis in the Conservative movement in the U.S. and Israel. \n\nThere is a custom still practiced today by Hasidic and some Haredi grooms who hand out free cigarettes to their friends at their \"vort\" (engagement). Recent rulings against smoking by great rabbis do not have seem to have stopped the tradition. Early on in the Hasidic movement, the Baal Shem Tov taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era. Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev is quoted as saying that \"a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath\". Rabbi Dovid of Lelov taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of Lelov and Skulen, however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after Havdalah. Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of Purim, even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple. However, many Hasidic Rabbis oppose smoking.\n\nIn 2006, the \"Vaad Halacha\" (Jewish law committee), sponsored by the Rabbinical Council of America, ruled that the use of tobacco is forbidden to Jews, and the committee specifically cited and reversed precedents that permitted smoking.\n\n Its bibliography:\n"}

{"id": "1925179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925179", "title": "McCloskey critique", "text": "McCloskey critique\n\nThe McCloskey critique refers to a critique of post-1940s \"official modernist\" methodology in economics, inherited from logical positivism in philosophy. The critique maintains that the methodology neglects how economics can be done, is done, and should be done to advance the subject. Its recommendations include use of good rhetorical devices for \"disciplined conversation.\"\n\nDeirdre McCloskey's 1985 book \"The Rhetoric of Economics\" argues that \"The Mathematization of Economics Was a Good Idea\", but that \"economic modernism\" took equilibrium model-building and econometrics (especially \"existence-theorem\" mathematics, and statistical significance) \"absurdly\" far. Roughly speaking McCloskey wants economics to make interesting, new, and true statements about the real world, and argues that proving the hypothetical possibility of an effect within an analytical framework is not a constructive way of doing this. Although the conventional way of connecting the economic model with the world is through econometric analysis, she cites many examples in which professors of econometrics were able to use the same data to both prove and disprove the applicability of a model's conclusions. She argues that the vast efforts expended by economists on analytical equations is essentially wasted effort.\n\nIn \"Ask What the Boys in the Sandbox Will Have\", McCloskey identified the economists whom she accuses of leading economics astray in the 1940s:\n\nHer complaint against the modern profession, and against the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel winners above, has provoked a strong defense from the economic mainstream. It has led to debates with such figures as Kenneth Arrow, who vigorously support the \"Samuelson\" approach, and argue that the quantity of analytical mathematical models in modern economics is a critical requirement for progress. However, McCloskey acknowledges the virtues as being born from each man's \"genius\", and rather blames the vices as being created not by these three Nobel economists, but by their students and their students' students, including herself.\n\nMcCloskey says that most economists when they write are \"\", assuming that they know already, and concentrating on a high standard of mathematical proof rather than a \"scholarly\" accumulation of relevant, documented facts about the real world. The advice she offers colleagues here is to spend more time in the archives, and write more heavily researched papers from specific observations in the real world (she argues that this is the norm in the natural sciences on which economics believes it is modelling itself, but that most economics practitioners actually base their methodology more closely on pure mathematics).\n\nSince she says: \"No one really believes a scientific assertion in economics based on statistical significance\" the solution she proposes to establishing cause and effect in economics is \"calibrated simulation\". Calibrated simulation relies on measurement and numerical techniques (such as Monte Carlo methods) to test the robustness of its predictions, without requiring a closed-form solution proving that the postulated relationship will always hold (or will be reached in \"equilibrium\", or be impossible). As an illustration, she contrasts the Babylonian and Greek \"rhetoric\" used to back up the claim that the square on the long side of every right angle triangle has the same area as the sum of squares on the other two sides: While Greek geometry found a 'universal proof', the Babylonian engineers simply measured the sides of a thousand right triangular stones, and applied the heuristic that since all of these obeyed the relationship so would the rest. McCloskey believes that the Babylonian approach is more applicable to economics, and that Moore's Law and advances in modeling software will soon make it easier to use and understand than the Greek approach.\n\nIn \"Calibrated Simulation is Storytelling\" she writes that one way to describe scientific theories is how mechanically mathematical they are: at the one end lie such hypotheses as Newtonian celestial mechanics which can be reduced entirely to equations - at the other are important works such as \"The Origin of Species\" which are \"entirely historical and devoid of mathematical models\". McCloskey says that economics would benefit from recalibrating its output within that spectrum to the more historical, \"narrative\" analysis.\n\n\n"}

Even there, there were two types of the divination used. Some court magicians would use inductive lecanomancy; whereby the magician or priest would observe patterns of oil within water to predict the future. However, intuitive lecanomany is thought to have developed out of this, which merely required the magician to interpret ripples on the water through meditation.\n\nThere are also reports of inductive lecanomany being used by the Mesopotamians, though they sometimes substituted flour for oil.\n\nIn the Old Testament a form of lecanomancy was apparently used by Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 44:5) \n\nThe Catawba people used an entirely different system of divination, which is still classified as lecanomany, whereby a bowl of water was placed by a deceased person's head. On the third day of the bowl being present, the deceased's family would watch the bowl for ripples and these would be interpreted to determine the whereabouts of the deceased's soul.\n\nIn medieval Europe, lecanomancy was described as clear bowls being filled with water to determine the future. This is in stark contrast with earlier forms of the divination, which used clay bowls or basins.\n\nOther forms of lecanomancy throughout history involved dropping a rock in water and interpreting the ripples in the water. In yet another form, demons were thought to enter the water whose ripples were being interpreted, and were forced to answer questions by the scryer.\n\n\n"}

Hot mirrors can be designed to be inserted into the optical system at an incidence angle varying between zero and 45 degrees, and are useful in a variety of applications where the buildup of waste heat can damage components or adversely affect spectral characteristics of the illumination source. Wavelengths reflected by an infrared hot mirror range from about 750 to 1250 nanometers. By transmitting visible light wavelengths while reflecting infrared, hot mirrors can also serve as dichromatic beam splitters for specialized applications in fluorescence microscopy or optical eye tracking.\n\nSome early digital cameras designed for visible light capture, such as the Associated Press NC2000 and Nikon Coolpix 950, were unusually sensitive to infrared radiation, and tended to produce colours that were contaminated with infrared. This was particularly problematic with scenes that contained strong sources of infrared, such as fires, although the effect could be moderated by inserting a photographic hot mirror filter into the imaging pathway. Conversely, these cameras could be used for infrared photography by inserting a cold mirror filter into the imaging pathway, most commonly by mounting the filter on the front of the lens.\n\nNew incandescent bulbs incorporate hot mirrors, increasing efficiency by redirecting unwanted infrared frequencies back to the filament.\n"}

As a priest, he was also known as Abbé Nollet.\n\nNollet studied humanities at the Collège de Clermont in Beauvais, starting in 1715. He completed a master's degree in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Paris in 1724. He was consecreated as a deacon in the Roman Catholic church in 1728, but abandoned his clerical career in the same year. However he used the title of Abbé throughout his life. Nollet was particularly interested in the new science of electricity. He joined the Société des Arts in 1728, an association which was reestablished from a previous version which ended in 1723. Formed under the patronage of Comte de Clermont, the Société focused on applying natural philosophy to practical arts. \nThis association gave Nollet the opportunity to come into contact with important natural philosophers. \nIn particular, it is likely that he came into contact with Du Fay and Réaumur, two leading members of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Nollet assisted them with experiments in a wide variety of topics (e.g., anatomy of insects, fertilization of frogs, thermometry, pneumatics, phosphorescence, magnetism, and electricity) from about 1731 to 1735. In the period from 1731 to 1733, Nollet assisted Du Fay, especially with electrical experiments, and travelled with du Fay in 1734 to meet physicists in England and in 1736 to the Netherlands. He was a member of the Royal Society of London from 1734. He is reputed to have given the name to the Leyden jar after it was invented by Pieter van Musschenbroek. To finance his own experimental instruments, Nollet started building and selling duplicate instruments in 1735.\n\nFrom at least 1743, the Royal Academy of Sciences identified Nollet as the person who was particularly in charge of research about electricity.\n\nIn 1753 he became the first professor of experimental physics in France, at the collège de Navarre, University of Paris. In 1762, he was named director of the Royal Academy of Sciences.\n\nNollet held lectures aimed to popularise physics with the use of instruments. These lectures, collected together and published as \"Leçons de physique expérimentale\" and \"L’Art des expériences\", continued to inspire self-taught scientists through the 19th century.\n\nOne of many experimental demonstrations of static electricity which he carried out was the \"Electric boy\", in which a young man was suspended from the ceiling using insulating silk cords, and electrified, causing his body to accumulate charge. Objects were attracted to him, and close proximity of another person could lead to sparks.\n\nIn 1746 Nollet gathered about two hundred monks into a circle about a mile (1.6 km) in circumference, with pieces of iron wire connecting them. He then discharged a battery of Leyden jars through the human chain and observed that each man reacted at substantially the same time to the electric shock, showing that the speed of electricity's propagation was very high. In 1748 he discovered the phenomenon of osmosis in natural membranes. In the same year, he also invented an electroscope.\n\nIn 1750 Nollet was the first to report a phenomenon that is known today as electrostatic spraying. He noted that water flowing from a vessel would aerosolize if the vessel was electrified and placed near electrical ground. He also noted that similarly “a person, electrified by connection to a high-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound.”\n\n\n"}

Therefore, as with all other railways, it was authorised under its own Act of Parliament and built to higher (and more costly) standards than similar railways of the time. In the United Kingdom it was notable as being the only narrow gauge line required to use main-line standard signalling. For a short period the line earned a modest return for shareholders, but for most of its life the L&B made a loss. In 1923 the L&B was taken over by the Southern Railway, and eventually closed in September 1935.\n\nThe Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Association was formed in 1979; and a short section was reopened to passengers in 2004. This was extended in 2006; and the following year plans were announced to open of track, linking the station at Woody Bay to both Lynton (at a new terminus on an extension to the original line, closer to the town) and Blackmoor Gate, and to a new station at Wistlandpound Reservoir. The present track is now narrow gauge.\n\nFollowing the opening of the Devon and Somerset Railway to Barnstaple, there were calls for an extension to serve the twin villages of Lynton and Lynmouth, which were popular with holiday-makers.\n\nThrough the middle of the 19th century, several schemes were proposed, from established railway companies and independent developers. One scheme suggested electric power, while another proposed a line from South Molton. None of these schemes offered sufficient prospects to encourage investment, and few got further than initial plans.\n\nDue to the difficult terrain, one scheme suggested a narrow gauge, already in use by the and elsewhere, to ease construction. This scheme was supported by Sir George Newnes, publisher of Titbits and The Strand Magazine who became chairman of the company. The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Bill was passed on 27 June 1895, and the line opened on 11 May 1898 with public service commencing on 16 May, connecting with trains from Waterloo on the Ilfracombe Branch Line at Barnstaple Town.\n\nThe scheme did not meet with universal enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were some who doubted the true intentions of the promoters. Although many of the sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient where there was no leeway (most observers being oblivious to the fact that a straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route.\n\nA guide published whilst the line was being built stated:\nThe L&B seldom attracted sufficient passengers to remain viable. The journey of nearly took on average an hour and a half. To satisfy several influential residents, the terminus at Lynton was some distance from the town itself, and from the cliff railway to Lynmouth.\n\nDeclining tourism during the First World War, improved roads, increased car ownership further depleted the line's income until it was no longer economic.\nA guidebook published in 1921 described the situation:\n\nDespite numerous cost-saving measures and extra investment in the line, the Southern Railway was unable to reverse the trend, and closed the line.\n\nThe last train ran on 29 September 1935. An observer at the time wrote: \n\nThe Southern removed everything they could use elsewhere, and by 8 November, had lifted the track from Lynton to milepost 15⅓ - on the Barnstaple side of Woody Bay station. On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract much interest. Most rolling stock, and every loco except for \"Lew\", was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches were sectioned for use as garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats found their way into local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco \"Lew\" was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938.\n\nThe L&B had an exemplary safety record, and no members of the public were killed or injured during its 37-year existence, although accidents at Braunton Road and Chumhill did claim the lives of three track workers.\n\nThe route of this diminutive railway and the scenery through which it passes, has been described many times, such as in a 1920s guide to the area:\n\nAs well as several foot- and cycle-routes which can still be followed today, the hostelry in Parracombe mentioned in the article remains a popular venue (although the geese are now singular).\n\nThe L&B rises and falls several times along its length. Starting at above sea level, The first , through Barnstaple, and along the Yeo Valley stays relatively level. \"Collard Bridge\" marks the start of an climb, mainly at one in fifty, to Blackmoor Gate. A shallower down-gradient follows, of about , towards Parracombe Bank, and the start of another climb, of about , to Woody Bay — at , the highest railway station in southern England. The line then falls, again mostly at one in fifty (2%) - to Lynton & Lynmouth station, still above the sea, and hidden by the landscape from the town of Lynton. The minimum radius on curves was .\n\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the L&B was its rolling stock, with the locomotives appearing originally in a livery of plain lined Holly green, later on a black base, with chestnut under-frames, hauling passenger carriages coloured terracotta with off-white upper panels, and light grey goods wagons. The schemes were simplified as individual vehicles were repainted. With the take over by the Southern and arrival of Lew the livery was slowly changed to Maunsell Green for locos and passenger stock, and umber for the goods wagons. The loco headlamps which had been black under the L&B were re-painted red.\n\nAt least four contractors' locomotives were used for construction. Unusually, some of the temporary track was wider than the final gauge - the section around Parracombe Bank for example, spanning the Heddon valley, was built to gauge, with a locomotive known as \"Winnie\". A fifth locomotive - perhaps named \"Spondon\" - may also have been used, although little is known of either of these. In 1900, \"Kilmarnock\" was sold by the L&B. It is believed to have been left behind by James Nuttall, as a result of the financial problems and litigation between railway and contractor.\n\nThe L&B used only coal-fired steam motive power. In 1896, the Hunslet Engine Company submitted two designs (a and a ), but eventually an order was placed for three s from Manning Wardle & Co of Leeds. The locos were named after local rivers: \"Yeo\", \"Exe\", and \"Taw\". These were supplemented by a , \"Lyn\", built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, USA, as the Company realised that three locos would be insufficient. Baldwin was selected as they could deliver the loco — based largely on standard components — more quickly than domestic suppliers, who had a backlog of orders, caused by a national engineering dispute over the 8 hour working day resulting in a lock-out by employers from July 1897 and January 1898. After construction by Baldwin, the loco was shipped across the Atlantic in parts, and re-assembled at Pilton by railway staff. It first steamed in July 1898. The Manning Wardles were delivered ahead of the lock-out, and \"Yeo\" and \"Taw\" were used in the final stages of construction. \"Exe\" was stored locally in a stable, where she received the unwelcome attention of thieves who stole various brass fittings and fixtures.\n\nIn 1923 the L&B was absorbed into the Southern Railway, and began an upgrade programme. All locos & coaches were repainted in Southern Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in Southern Umber livery and track and buildings were improved. A fifth locomotive, \"Lew\" was purchased in 1925, with improvements to the original Manning Wardle design.\n\nAlthough bought at the auction (it is believed by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, \"Lew\" was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, \"Lew\" was moved by rail to Swansea and loaded onto the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then vanished from history and despite several attempts, no trace of the locomotive, or evidence of its fate, has so far been found.\n\nSixteen passenger carriages were delivered for the opening. Built by the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works Co. Ltd., these comprised six different types, all the same size, being long, wide, ( over steps) and high — large by narrow gauge standards — and certainly superior to any previous British narrow gauge stock.\n\nThe coaching stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation far in advance of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design was used as the basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - testament to the excellence of the original design.\n\nThe body for coach 17 was built in 1911, by local firm Shapland and Petter, and mounted on a steel underframe constructed by the railway in its own workshops at Pilton. Marginally longer than the earlier coaches, it contained both smoking and non-smoking accommodation for first and third class passengers, as well as the brake van space.\n\nThe Southern Railway introduced several new items of goods stock, and also purchased two ex-War Department travelling cranes for the line.\n\nGoods-only trains were a rarity, and the usual practice was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services. Whilst the shunting of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to the interest of the tourist and occasional traveller, it also added marginally to the journey time.\n\nThe open goods wagons were originally delivered with a single top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.\n\nThe bogie open doors were also originally top-hung, but converted by the railway at Pilton.\n\nWagon No. 19 was originally used by the contractors. After the railway opened, it was modified and entered revenue service in 1900. At only it was used often in preference to an wagon as it reduced the overall weight of a train.\n\nVan 23 - partially restored but now being prepared (2019) for service at Woody Bay - was built at Pilton by the L&B. Unlike all other L&B stock, its underframe was entirely made of wood. The restored van will have a steel underframe clad in wood.\n\nThe travelling cranes were ex-WD stock, and fitted with outriggers, rated at with a radius, at . Intended as recovery cranes in the event of a derailment, neither saw much use. One crane, with its match truck, was kept in the long headshunt at Pilton, the other was put to use in Lynton goods yard.\n\nThe 1927 bogie goods vans were originally fitted with heavy diagonal wooden cross braces at each end, but these were later replaced with single diagonal angle-iron braces.\n\nEighty-five years after its closure, much of the line is still in evidence. The most spectacular evidence is Bridge 22 - the brick-built Chelfham Viaduct. Fully restored in 2000, its eight wide arches reach above the Stoke Rivers valley — the largest narrow-gauge railway structure in England.\n\nThe stations at Lynton and Bratton Fleming are now private residences, Blackmoor Gate is a restaurant and Barnstaple Town a school. Chelfham and Woody Bay both serve the new L&B. Chelfham station is currently being restored, and open to visitors every weekend, while Woody Bay is the main centre of operations. Snapper Halt was purchased in 2010 by Exmoor Associates - a private company dedicated to securing trackbed for the restoration of the railway.\n\nA short section of the line reopened to passengers in 2004. Bridge 67 was generously rebuilt as a gift by Edmund Nuttall Ltd. — a firm descended from James Nuttall of Manchester, the main contractors for the original construction — allowing an extension to Killington Lane in 2006.\n\nWork is progressing on the next section to be restored, towards Parracombe, Blackmoor and a new temporary Southern terminus at Wistlandpound Reservoir. A total of 7 planning applications were submitted to Exmoor National Park Authority and North Devon Council in February 2016, with approvals granted by March 2018. Restoration of Bridges 54 and 55 was completed in December 2019.\n\nIn November 2015 the Lynton & Barnstaple signed a twinning agreement with the Walhalla Goldfields Railway in Victoria, Australia. This agreement came about due to the similar nature of the railways and to foster cooperation and volunteer exchanges. Like the L&B, the Moe-Walhalla railway was closed over 70 years ago and the work of restoration requires rebuilding the track bed and railway infrastructure.\n\nUnlike the Welsh Highland Railway, the track bed was sold off piecemeal - often reverting to the original owners, paying much less than they had sold it for originally. Although there has been minor development on parts of the route, and Wistlandpound Reservoir has flooded the track bed close to its midpoint, much is still in open countryside, with many sections identifiable.\n\nThe Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Association (since 2000, a charitable trust) was formed in 1979. Woody Bay Station was purchased by the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Company in 1995 and, after much effort, a short section of railway reopened to passengers in 2004. This was extended to over a mile in 2006, with steam and diesel-hauled trains running between Woody Bay and the new, temporary terminus at Killington Lane.\n\nIn 1995, the Lynbarn Railway — at the \"Milky Way\", a theme park near Clovelly, was created and operated by L&B volunteers. Profits from this funded the purchase, restoration and reopening of Woody Bay. The \"Lynbarn\" was handed over to the park in 2005, once Woody Bay had become established, and continues to operate as part of the attraction.\n\nLittle original rolling stock survives, but as well as the heritage coaches mentioned below, the largely restored Van 23 was on display at Woody Bay until being removed to the L&B restoration team in Essex in November 2013, for refurbishment and the fitting of brakes, underframe and couplers. The remains of several other coaches and Goods Van 4 are in storage awaiting reconstruction.\n\nCoach 2, used as a summer house, is on display (unrestored) at the National Railway Museum York along with the nameplates of the original locomotives. Coach 15, recovered from Snapper Halt in 1959 and restored by the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales, has been running there (now as FR Coach 14) for longer than it did on the L&B. Due to the Ffestiniog's smaller loading gauge, the roof profile was altered so it can pass through Garnedd tunnel. In September 2010, Coach 15 visited the L&B with the \"Lew\" replica loco, \"Lyd\".\n\nA 1915 Kerr Stuart \"Joffre\" class 0-6-0T loco was bought in 1983, and named \"Axe\". Restored to working order in 2008, \"Axe\" worked most passenger trains at Woody Bay until December 2013. An 0-4-0WT Maffei named \"Sid\", owned by several L&B members, was also used on the L&B steam service until the end of 2013, when it was sold off to a railway museum line in Sweden. To replace \"Sid\", another privately owned loco, \"Isaac\" - a Bagnall 0-4-2T, No. 3023, built in 1953 for use in South African Platinum mine - arrived at Woody Bay from Boston Lodge in December 2013, principally for use hauling the restored original L&B heritage coaches.\n\nThe Trust owns three industrial diesel locomotives, one of which \"Pilton\", can be used as backup for \"Axe\" and \"Isaac\", and another, \"Heddon Hall\", is often used for maintenance trains.\n\nA number of other visiting diesel and steam locomotives have also seen service on the line.\n\nSixteen coaches were originally built for the L&B in 1898, and another was built by the railway in 1911. Although most were broken up when the railway closed, several parts have survived, and have been retrieved and stored by the railway preservationists.\n\nFollowing a ten-year restoration, Coaches 7 and 17 returned to Woody Bay on 15 April 2013, to re-enter passenger-carrying service on 10 May 2013 after an absence of 78 years. Coach 16 followed in September 2013, and Coach 11 returned in April 2015. Coach 5 returned to service after restoration in August 2019, with Coach 1 the next to be restored. The initial rake of three heritage coaches, after an inaugural service over the Autumn Gala weekend in September 2013, entered regular service - hauled by \"Isaac\" - for the Santa Specials in December 2014.\n\nA Lynton and Barnstaple Manning Wardle type replica, named \"Lyd\", is operational on the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales.\n\nFirst Steamed in Spring 2010, \"Lyd\" visited Woody Bay in September 2010 - to mark the 75th Anniversary of the closure of the L&B. \"Lyd\" first moved under its own steam on 5 August 2010 and then underwent running-in trials before visiting the L&B in September 2010 with former L&B coach 15 and Ffestiniog Railway observation car 102.\n\nA modern version of the Baldwin, \"Lyn\" - looking externally similar to the 1898 original, but employing several advanced steam technologies, including roller bearings, welded tanks, Lempor exhaust system, and a high-pressure boiler - was completed in 2017. Its first public steaming took place on 8 July 2017 at Alan Keef Ltd. Lyn was delivered to Woody Bay on 11 September 2017, and first ran there on 28 September.\n\nA set of frames for a new \"Yeo\" were built by Winson Engineering in 2000, and these are in storage, awaiting further funds to continue the construction. A new fundraising campaign was launched in 2019 to build replicas of both \"Yeo\" and \"Exe\", but it is unclear yet whether the Winson frames can be used for the new \"Yeo\".\n\nRestoring passenger services from Woody Bay was a major undertaking by the enthusiastic volunteers. Although much of the track bed survives intact, several obstacles — including Wistlandpound Reservoir — must be overcome if the greater part of the route is to be restored, fulfilling the hopes expressed in a card left at Barnstaple on the day after the line closed — \"Perchance it is not dead, but sleepeth\"...\n\nIn October 2007, the railway announced plans for reinstating enough trackbed to reopen of track, linking the station at Woody Bay to both Lynton (at a new terminus on an extension to the original line, closer to the town) and a new station at Wistlandpound. It is hoped that the extension, codenamed 'Phase 2a', will be complete by 2026.\n\n\"Exmoor Enterprise\", the working group leading the project, estimated that the full project being considered was likely to cost around £30 million, including the building of replica rolling stock, reconstructing original coaches and Van 4, as well as improving the line as an important local tourist attraction.\nThe railway's management predicts the scheme will generate over £70 million for the south west economy within five years.\n\nWorking closely with international engineering and design consultants Arup, The L&B Trust held a series of public consultations during May and June 2012, providing information to local communities about plans for obtaining a TWO, and the next phase of the reinstatement, south-west from Killington Lane to Blackmoor, then Wistlandpound, and north-east to Caffyns, and eventually to Lynton.\n\nLonger-term plans see reopening the line towards Barnstaple.\n\n\nMulti-media:\nBooks:\n\nMagazines:\n\nMuch has been written about the L&B since its closure in 1935, and this continues today. The railway regularly features in articles published by specialist railway, engineering, heritage and modelling magazines.\n\n"}

She provides voices for English language versions of Japanese anime films and television series.\n\nMonica Jean Rial was born on October 5, 1975 in Houston, Texas. Her father is from Pontevedra, Galicia, Spain. When she was young, her family would often visit Spain. She would translate for her younger brother some of the European Spanish-dubbed cartoons which included anime shows \"Doraemon\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\", often imitating the various characters. Rial studied ballet, tap, and jazz, but transitioned to musical theater when was 12. She studied acting through high school as well as college at the University of Houston. In an interview with Otaku News, Rial mentioned voice actor inspirations from \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\" and \"Beavis and Butt-head\". She was working on a theater show with Jason Douglas, who suggested she audition for ADV Films.\n\nRial's first voice-over role was some walla in the 1999 dub of \"Martian Successor Nadesico\". In an interview with Otaku News, Rial said she had to talk for two minutes straight as folks in a crowd telling the Jovians to go home. She would later land main character roles as Miharu in \"Gasaraki\", Natsume in \"Generator Gawl\", and the title character in ADV Films' production of \"Hello Kitty's Animation Theater\", the last of which was one of ADV's best-selling DVDs. In 2001, she voiced Izumi in the baseball anime \"Princess Nine\" and in 2002, she got to voice Hyatt in \"Excel Saga\", which she listed among her absolute favorites.\n\nIn 2003, Rial voiced best-friend character Kyoko Tokiwa in \"Full Metal Panic!\", and got to reprise her for \"Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu\" and \"Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid\". In the same year, Rial voiced Kirika Yumura, the quiet assassin partner in \"Noir\". Rial said that Kirika was challenging because she had very few words but had to convey a lot of emotions. She also noted that Kirika's personality changed over the course of the series, so she voiced her to be more emotional in later episodes which drew some criticism from fans. She also voiced Lila in \"Najica Blitz Tactics\" where she also got to do a DVD commentary along with fellow actress Kira Vincent-Davis. The commentaries have become popular as she receives feedback from fans about them at anime conventions. She voiced female protagonist Haruka Shitou in the sci-fi show \"RahXephon\".\n\nIn 2004, Rial started voice-over work with the anime dubbing company Funimation in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. During that year, she voiced Amy in the long-running detective anime series \"Case Closed\", and Lyra (aka Dante) in the drama series \"Fullmetal Alchemist\". Both of these shows were featured on Cartoon Network. She also voiced co-lead character Lumiere in \"Kiddy Grade\". Meanwhile, with ADV, she voiced Nyamo-sensei in the school comedy \"Azumanga Daioh\". She had also taken over some character roles as Momiji in \"Blue Seed\" and Maya in \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". Rial said that it was very difficult to try to sound like the previous voice actors, especially Maya's low voice, so she tried her own approach. She also got to voice Pen-Pen the penguin in \"Evangelion\". In 2005, she voiced the serious lead character Jo in a team of mercenary girls in the cyberpunk science fiction series \"Burst Angel\".\n\nRial continued to land leading roles in anime shows. In 2006, she voiced the title character in \"Nanaka 6/17\", about a 17-year-old girl who, through an accident, has amnesia and regresses to her 6-year-old self. In \"Speed Grapher\" she voiced female protagonist Kagura Tennōzu, and in the ADV Films remake of \"Macross\", she voiced Misa Hayase. In 2007, she voiced in the English anime adaptation of Clamp's \"\"; Maria in \"Witchblade\"; Misuzu Kamio, a heroine in \"Air\", and the title character in \"\". She also voiced lead characters Misao Shinohara, Sasami's best friend in \"\"; and heroine Asa Shigure in the harem comedy \"Shuffle!\".\n\nIn 2010, when \"Dragon Ball Z\" was remade as \"Dragon Ball Z Kai\", Rial got to voice the heroine character Bulma. She voiced other lead girl characters such as Miya Asami in \"Sekirei\", Tsubaki Nakatsukasa in \"Soul Eater\", May Chang in \"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood\", and Ringo in \"Casshern Sins\". Both \"Soul Eater\" and \"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood\" have had sizeable runs on Adult Swim's Toonami block. In 2011, she voiced the title character Mina Tepes in \"Dance in the Vampire Bund\", as well as several lead female characters in ensemble shows \"Rosario + Vampire\", \"Highschool of the Dead\" and \"Fairy Tail\", such as Yukari Sendou, Shizuka Marikawa, and Mirajane Strauss respectively.\n\nRial voiced more leads in 2012 with Shiro in \"Deadman Wonderland\" which also broadcast on Adult Swim, Stocking in the raunchy comedy \"Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt\". In 2013, she voiced the heroine character Haruko Amaya in the harem comedy \"Maken-ki!\" and Iori Nagase in the school anime series \"Kokoro Connect\". With regards to her lead role of Michiko Malandro in \"Michiko & Hatchin\", which was released on DVD in 2013 and was broadcast on Adult Swim in 2015, Rial said that out of the 300 or so characters she had voiced, only two of them were Hispanic, and she liked that her character wasn't a stereotype. In 2014 and 2015, she voiced the title characters in the comedies \"Watamote\" and \"Maid Sama!\" as Tomoko Kuroki and Misaki Ayuzawa, respectively. \n\nIn addition to voice acting, Rial has been steadily involved in ADR script writing, with work in the English dubs for \"D.N. Angel\", \"Madlax\", and \"Gatchaman\". In an interview with Active Anime, Rial said she would \"take the direct translation and write it into a coherent scene that matches the lip flaps\". At later anime conventions, Rial has mentioned that ADR script writing has kept her quite occupied, especially with simuldubs, which are shows that are locally dubbed soon after the original broadcast. She has also written columns for \"Newtype\"s USA edition. In January 2018, Rial has announced that she is taking time off of script adaptation.\n\nIn 2019, Rial alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by fellow voice actor Vic Mignogna in 2007. On April 19, 2019, Mignogna filed a lawsuit against Rial, her fiancé, Ron Toye, as well as Funimation and Jamie Marchi for tortious interference, civil conspiracy, and defamation in regards to Rial's allegations. On July 19, 2019, Rial, Toye and Marchi all filed anti-SLAPP motions for Mignogna to dismiss his lawsuit. On October 4, 2019, the case was dismissed, and all the charges against Funimation, Marchi, Rial and Toye were dropped.\n\nRial has a younger brother, Miguel, and a younger sister, Natalie, who is also an actress. Both siblings have voiced in anime dubs. Rial is currently engaged to Ron Toye.\n\n"}

The current rabbi is Joel Fleekop.\n\nThe first Jews who migrated to northwest Florida originally stopped at Milton, twenty miles to the east, because Milton was a national hub for lumber production and distribution in the South (the first Jews to the area were skilled in lumber production; they came from heavily wooded areas in what is now southern Germany). \n\nSensing more business opportunities to the west, a congregation settled in Pensacola and founded a Reform temple after forming in 1876. Many of the lumber workers in Milton did not follow the congregation, and eventually started a smaller Jewish community in Okaloosa County when lumber opportunities dried up. The male members of Beth-El's first congregation consisted largely of businessmen and tavern owners.\n\nTemple Beth-El is now in its third building, still in its same spot on 800 North Palafox Street. The current building, designed in the 1930s, is an example of Art Deco architecture, which was prominent in Florida at the time.\n\nToday, many members of the current congregation are descendants of the men who founded the temple over 125 years ago. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, Israel, and the Caucasus eventually settled in Pensacola and became part of the congregation as well. Beth-El is unique today in that a large number of the congregation consists of Jews who converted from other faiths.\n\nStarting in 1962, Paula Ackerman, the first woman to perform rabbinical functions in the United States, served the congregation at Beth-El. A Pensacola native, Beth-El was Mrs. Ackerman's home temple and she was asked to fill in until a suitable replacement was found in 1963.\n\n\n\n\nOldest synagogues in the United States\n"}

He joined London Wasps at the age of 16 from Welwyn RFC. He went on to help Wasps win the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 1999 and 2000. He became the youngest player to represent England U21s, after being a member of the England Schools 18 Group Grand Slam team in 1994–95. Amongst his trophies at Wasps were four Premiership titles in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. Worsley played in all four finals, scoring a try in 2003. He also played in the victorious 2004 and 2007 Heineken Cup finals. \n\nWorsley is noted for his defensive capabilities against opposing ball-carriers. His ability to play any of the three back row positions earned him a place in the England World Cup Squad in 1999 as a bench replacement. He won his first cap against Tonga at the World Cup, then came on as a replacement against both Scotland and Italy during England's Six Nations Championship matches in 2000. He won two more caps as a replacement in that summer's Tests against South Africa in Pretoria and Bloemfontein. He enjoyed a successful tour to North America in the summer of 2001, filling Lawrence Dallaglio’s number 8 position and scoring against both Canada and the United States.\n\nHe continued in the back row for England's 2001 Investec Challenge matches, when he turned in two outstanding performances against Australia and South Africa. He also replaced Richard Hill in both of England's 2003 tour matches against New Zealand and Australia.\n\nHis 2002–03 season started well, and Worsley won the Man of The Match award against Saracens in September. However, a hamstring injury, forced him out of the England Autumn Internationals and six weeks of the Zurich Premiership.\nHe scored England's second try in their win over Wales at Cardiff in 2003, just eight days after scoring against France A for England A at Northampton, and being voted man of the match.\nWorsley was a member of England's victorious Rugby World Cup squad in 2003, coming on during the pool match against South Africa and starting against both Samoa and Uruguay.\n\nIn 2004 he played against Italy, Ireland and France in the Six Nations Championship, as well as coming off the bench against Wales to score a match winning try. Worsley played powerfully against both South Africa and Australia in November 2004. He started in the back row, now an automatic choice after former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio retired from England duty two months earlier.\nHe was a member of the London Wasps side that won both the Zurich Premiership final and the Heineken European Cup Final in 2004 and he played well on the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia.\nHe missed out on England's entire 2005 Autumn test series due to a knee injury but regained full fitness in time for the 2006 Six nations championship.\nWorsley participated in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He made a \"try-saving tap-tackle\" which prevented Vincent Clerc of France from scoring a probable match-winning try late in the semi-final (13 October). Worsley toured New Zealand in June 2008, coming on as a substitute in both Tests, and was named as a replacement for Tom Rees in the shadow of the 2009 Six Nations, and began as a replacement against Italy.\n\nHe then restarted his international career, starting in front of Steffon Armitage against Wales, and proving his worth, earning man of the match.\nHe played on the Lions 2009 tour of South Africa in front of any other English flankers.\nOn 1 August 2011 it was announced that Worsley had been cut from England's training squad due to injury and would probably miss the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nOn 14 November 2011 it was announced that Worsley would be forced to retire due to a neck injury.\n\nWorsley is now defence coach of French top 14 team Bordeaux Bègles.\n\nHe is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland.\n\nHe has also started actively participating in Rugby classes for the Alex Boys academy, helping disadvantaged children learn rugby of which he is a keen advocate.\n\n"}

The show is broadcast 6:30–10:00am each weekday (originally broadcasting from 6:55–10:00am between 2004–2007).\n\nAt eight years, \"The Chris Moyles Show\" did continue to hold the title of the longest running breakfast show in BBC Radio 1's history, having overtaken original Radio 1 breakfast show presenter Tony Blackburn's tenure of five years between 1967 and 1973.\n\nThe original BBC Radio 1 show lasted for three and a half hours, with news and sport read half-hourly between 06:30 and 10:00, except at 09:00. Starting on 1 January 2007, the show began with the \"Cheesy Song\", an opening song performed by session singer Richard Oliver in the style of the \"Station Song\" jingles which were commonly used in radio before the advent of 24-hour broadcasting. Starting on 5 January 2009, the song had its own day, for example, if it was Wednesday, it would go \"the Wednesday Cheesy Song\" repeatedly. A typical half-hour segment contained fifteen to twenty minutes of chat, discussing the team members' lives, Radio 1's features, music or popular culture. There were regular celebrity guest interviews usually between 08:00 and 09:00, with the occasional live music performance and frequent first exclusive plays of new single releases. At 10:00, when Fearne Cotton took over (who took over the slot previously occupied by Jo Whiley from 21 September 2009) Moyles and the team would typically talk to Cotton for the first few minutes. The show relied in a variation of the \"zoo\" format, with members of the production team, news and sport readers and other studio guests contributing throughout the show.\n\n\nNumerous other features of past shows include \"Celebrity Tarzan\", \"Celebrity Two Word Tango\", \"Who Knows Dom?\", \"One Word Weather with Nelson Mandela\", \"One Road Travel\", \"Yesterday's Weather\", \"Truth or Gunge\", \"Listen, Watch, Cher\", \"Let's get ready to Ramble!\" and \"Birthday Corner\".\n\nOther former regular competitions hosted included \"Viaduct\" (named by Simon Mayo when asked for a suggestion about what to call the quiz when Moyles stood in for Zoë Ball on the breakfast show). It was based on a \"Two Ronnies\" sketch (in turn based on \"Mastermind\", with a specialist subject of \"answering the question before the last\").\n\nThe team members of \"The Chris Moyles Show\" on Radio 1 were:\n\n\nAs well as the team members, other contributors also regularly featured on the show:\n\nScott Mills covered the programme when Moyles and the team were absent, and presented the programme under the title \"The Chris Moyles Show with Scott Mills\". Mills used most of his own features from his afternoon slot, and was joined on air by radio personalities Rebecca Huxtable, Mark Chapman and Chris Stark.\n\nWhen only Moyles was away, Vernon Kay or Sara Cox would present in his place, and stay with the usual format of the show.\n\nOn 28 February 2011, it was announced that Moyles and David Vitty would attempt to beat the record for the longest continuous Radio 1 show in aid of Comic Relief. The previous record of 37 hours was set by Simon Mayo from 1999.\n\nMoyles and Vitty began their record attempt on the morning of 16 March 2011. At the beginning of the show, Moyles announced that they would attempt to break the \"Guinness World Record\" for \"Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)\" and attempt to continuously broadcast for 51 hours 30 minutes. At 19:30 on 17 March they were joined by Simon Mayo who held the previous record and also revealed that they had raised £1,009,033. Moyles and Vitty were presented with a cake by Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt.\n\nOn Friday 18 March 2011 at 08:30, Moyles and Comedy Dave broke the \"Guinness World Record\" for the 'Longest Marathon Radio DJ (team)' and by the end of the show (at 10:00), they had hit the 51 and a half hour mark. The duo opted to 'round it off' by going to 10:30 and thus set a new record of 52 hours. In doing, so they raised a final total of £2,406,648 for Comic Relief, which is an average of £46,282 for each hour they were on air. During the attempt, the duo were joined by many celebrity guests, including Paul O'Grady, Phillip Schofield, The Wanted, Chipmunk, Jimmy Carr, Craig David, Katy Perry and Ricky Gervais. The grand total has since increased to £2,821,831 and with an audience of 2.84 Million, the event was the most popular live BBC Red Button radio feature ever. 3.8 million people watched on the Radio 1 website.\n\nOn 18 November 2011, their record was broken by a breakfast show on the German station 98.8 KISS FM Berlin, when presenters Nora Neise and Tolga Akar were on air for 73 hours.\n\nOn 21 September 2015, Moyles relaunched the show on Radio X, the rebranded XFM, reviving the show under the same title. The new show incorporates elements of the BBC Radio 1 incarnation of the show, in particular referencing the opening \"Cheesy Song\" at the start of the show before reverting to the Radio X imaging, Paul Turner providing prerecorded voice over, and Richard Oliver singing the show's jingle. In February 2016 RAJAR published the first listener figures for the Radio X show. However these figures were only for FM listeners in London. Moyles provided a 39% boost in listeners for Radio X and gave the station its best breakfast show figures in London in almost a decade.\n\n\"The Chris Moyles Show\"'s rebrand on Radio X consisted largely of the same format used in the Radio 1 version. The \"Cheesy Song\" and similar jingles were replaced by a more distinguished rock-led sound. Dominic Byrne returned for news, sport and weather. Similarly Pippa Taylor, also previously at Radio 1, returned as producer joining previous XFM Breakfast Show producer Dave Masterman.\n\n\n\nJohnny Vaughan initially covered the programme when Moyles and the team were absent and presented the programme under the title \"The 6.30 till 10 Thang\" - a variation on his normal \"4 till 7 Thang\" drive-time slot. Vaughan used most of his own features from his afternoon slot and would be joined on air by his usual team of Gavin Woodman, Sunta Templeton, Big Si and Little Si.\n\nAs of 2019, Toby Tarrant typically covers Moyles and the team, keeping with the normal format of the show.\n\nStarting on 28 July 2005, as part of a BBC podcasting trial, a weekly podcast entitled the \"Best of Chris Moyles\" was released, containing the highlights from the past week of the show. Originally updated every Thursday, and now Friday as from January 2006, the podcast features highlights from the five previous broadcasts. It featured as the most downloaded podcast in the UK iTunes Music Store for much of 2005; however, in December 2005, it was overtaken by the Ricky Gervais Podcast. The podcast was regularly downloaded by over three hundred thousand people worldwide . The podcasts also contain original opening and closing links.\n\nFrom July 2011, the podcast was referred to as a Free Download and this was marked by the team on the 24 June 2011 episode.\n\nThe current Radio X show has a podcast available via iTunes and RSS.\n\nThere have been a number of complaints about \"The Chris Moyles Show\". These have included complaints of swearing, bullying, racism, homophobia, transphobia and sexism. Some of these complaints have been upheld by Ofcom, while others were dismissed.\n\n"}

He is best known for his stint in World Championship Wrestling in 2001 under the ring name Kid Romeo, where he was one half of the first ever Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions alongside Elix Skipper.\n\nAfter briefly working as a male stripper, Roman started wrestling in 1999 in World Championship Wrestling after being trained by Paul Orndorff at the WCW Power Plant. He debuted later that year at a house show on September 3 under the ring name Kid Romeo, where he defeated Triple A. Two days later, Triple A defeated Romeo in a rematch. After Triple A began using his real name (Allan Funk), the two exchanged victories on \"Saturday Night\" before Romeo began wrestling against fellow Power Plant graduates in dark matches through the rest of 1999 and into early 2000.\n\nOn the January 24, 2000 episode of \"Nitro\", Romeo made his televised debut and was easily defeated by The Wall. Two days later on \"Thunder\", Romeo lost to Prince Iaukea in a Cruiserweight Championship tournament quarterfinal match. After winning a few consecutive dark matches, Roman was sent to Japan to compete in New Japan Pro Wrestling in order to further hone his skills.\n\nAfter losing a match against Essa Ríos on the February 10, 2001 episode of \"Jakked\", Roman returned to WCW, where he resumed his Kid Romeo name and lost to Chris Harris in a dark match before SuperBrawl Revenge. On the March 5 episode of \"Nitro\", Romeo was introduced as Elix Skipper's mystery tag team partner against A.J. Styles and Air Paris. With Skipper, Romeo won his redebut match and they both advanced to the semi-finals of a tournament to crown the inaugural Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions. Upon returning, Romeo adopted a heel gimmick loosely based on Ricky Martin, which was further emphasized with his entrance music being a cover of Martin's song \"The Cup of Life\". The following week on \"Nitro\", Skipper and Romeo defeated The Jung Dragons to advance to the finals of the tournament. On March 18 at Greed, WCW's final pay-per-view, Romeo and Skipper defeated The Filthy Animals (Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Kidman) in the tournament finals to become the promotion's first ever Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions, which also gave Romeo the first championship of his career. Romeo and Skipper began feuding with the Animals over the title, and on the final episode of \"Thunder\" on March 21, Romeo and Skipper's undefeated streak was broken as they and Chavo Guerrero, Jr. lost to Mysterio, Jr. Kidman and Shane Helms. On the final episode of \"Nitro\" on March 26, their feud culminated as Romeo and Skipper lost the Cruiserweight Tag Team Title to Mysterio, Jr. and Kidman in what turned out to be the second to last match in WCW's history.\n\nFollowing WCW's closure, Roman traveled to Puerto Rico to wrestle for the World Wrestling Council. He also made some appearances in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, making his debut there on July 10, 2002 in a six-way elimination match that included Tony Mamaluke, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Jerry Lynn, and Low Ki, although Roman was eliminated after Low Ki forced him to submit. He returned to TNA on May 21 as Romeo, competing in a four-way match against CM Punk, Jason Cross and Paul London, the latter of whom won the match and became the number one contender to the X Division Championship. From 2003 to 2004, Roman would continue to be used as a jobber, losing to the likes of Raven, Jeff Hardy, Kid Kash and Chris Sabin. During his time with TNA, Roman's only victory was a tag team dark match where he and Sonjay Dutt defeated The Naturals. In addition to TNA, Roman also wrestled in Championship Wrestling from Florida for a short time, where he feuded with Tyree Pride. He returned to TNA for the final time on May 17, 2005, where he lost to Zach Gowen. Roman then took a hiatus from wrestling and subsequently began working as an exterminator.\n\nIn 2008, Roman returned to wrestling as Romeo and joined NWA South Atlantic. On May 10, he teamed with Benny Blanco as the Casanova Cartel to defeat Manson and Black Knight (the latter substituting for Manson's partner Rico Moon) to win the territory's Tag Team Championship. The Cartel would go on to hold the title for over six months before being defeated by the SWAT Patrol on November 15. Following the title loss, Roman retired from wrestling.\n\n"}

He has been an assistant manager of the Croatia national team since 2018.\n\nLadić was born in Čakovec, but grew up in the nearby village of Gornji Hrašćan and started his career at NK Varteks in 1977, transferring to the club's senior squad in 1980. He left Varteks for Dinamo Zagreb in 1984, but the club decided to loan him to Iskra Bugojno for two seasons immediately after they signed him. He eventually made his debut for Dinamo in July 1986 and stayed at the club until the end of his playing career nearly 14 years later, collecting a record-holding total of 802 appearances in official matches.\n\nDuring his time at the club, Ladić also played in several matches of both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup. In 1997, he notably saved a penalty kick in Dinamo Zagreb's home match against Partizan Belgrade in the first qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League, which they won 5–0. The Dinamo team continued to compete in the UEFA Cup after an unlucky 4-3 defeat on aggregate in the last minute of extra time against Newcastle United in the second qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League and got all the way to the third round, where they lost 2–1 on aggregate against Atlético Madrid.\n\nIn the autumn of 1998, Ladić debuted with Dinamo Zagreb in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League and played all six group matches before the club was eliminated from the competition by finishing second in their group, behind Olympiacos. The club repeated the success of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stages the following year, with Ladić making four group-stage appearances before being injured in the fourth group match against Sturm Graz and missing the final two matches before the team was eliminated from the competition after finishing last among the four teams in their group, one point behind the third-place Sturm Graz.\n\nHe soon recovered from the injury and continued to play for Dinamo until the end of the 1999–2000 season, making his last appearance for the club in the Croatian Cup finals against Hajduk Split on 16 May 2000 in Zagreb. With Dinamo, he won the Croatian First League champions title six times, in 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, as well as four Croatian Cup titles in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998.\n\nIn early 1990, Ladić was for the first time in his professional career a candidate to play for the national team of former Yugoslavia and was also mentioned to be part of their squad at the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals in Italy, but was eventually omitted from the squad without making his debut for the team that year. He eventually made his international debut for at the time newly founded Croatian national team in their first international match, a friendly against the United States on 17 October 1990 in Zagreb. After winning his first two caps for Croatia, Ladić nevertheless managed to make his international debut for Yugoslavia as well. He appeared in two matches, playing all 90 minutes in a friendly against Turkey on 27 February 1991 in İzmir and being the team's substitute goalkeeper in the last 25 minutes of a Euro 1992 qualifier against the Faroe Islands on 16 May 1991 in Belgrade. The match against the Faroes was also the last where Croatian footballers have played for the Yugoslav national team.\n\nLadić went on to become the first-choice goalkeeper of the Croatian national team throughout the 1990s and won a total of 59 international caps before he retired in May 2000. His competitive debut for the Croatian national team came in the team's first qualifying match for the UEFA Euro 1996 against Estonia on 4 September 1994 in Tallinn. He went on to make nine out of possible ten appearances in that qualifying campaign, only missing the team's away match against Ukraine due to a one-match suspension for a red card received in the previous home match against Slovenia. He was also the team's starting goalkeeper at the Euro 1996 finals in England, making three out of possible four appearances and only missing the final group match against Portugal where Croatia started to play with seven players who were normally left on the bench. Croatia was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals after losing 2–1 to Germany.\n\nLadić was also the first-choice goalkeeper during the Croatian national team's qualifying campaign for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and appeared in seven out of possible ten matches, but is mostly remembered from this period for his two blunders that he made during the qualifying campaign. The first happened to him in the team's home match against Denmark, when he conceded a bizarre goal after misjudging the path of Brian Laudrup's cross due to strong wind deflecting the ball and allowing Denmark to get an equaliser in the final ten minutes of the match. The incident saw Croatia losing two possibly crucial points after the match ended in a 1–1 draw. The second blunder was when he scored an own goal that put the Bosnia and Herzegovina team 1–0 up in another Croatia's home match, but the team eventually managed to get all three points with a tough 3–2 victory. Croatia eventually qualified for the finals after beating Ukraine 3–1 on aggregate in the play-offs, without Ladić playing in the second leg.\n\nDespite Ladić's solid performances for Dinamo Zagreb in the European competition in 1997, his two blunders for the national team were still remembered by many people and made them sceptical when he was chosen as the Croatian national team's starting goalkeeper at the 1998 World Cup finals in France. However, he showed really good shape at the tournament and already distinguished himself in the second group match against Japan with a great save of Masashi Nakayama's shot in a one-on-one situation. He once again attracted the attention in the quarterfinals against Germany by saving a header and a volley from Oliver Bierhoff at close range, helping the Croatian team to record a surprisingly convincing 3–0 victory over the highly favoured German side. In the semifinals, he was helpless against two Lilian Thuram's goals that gave France a 2–1 victory and a place in the Final, but once again performed well in the third-place match against the Netherlands, clearing several promising goalscoring chances from the Dutch side and conceding only an unstoppable shot from Boudewijn Zenden for the 1–1 equaliser. Croatia won the match 2–1 in the end and was awarded with bronze medals in their very first World Cup appearance since the country's independence. Ladić was seen by many as one of the three best goalkeepers of the tournament. He appeared in all of the team's seven matches.\n\nDespite initially announcing his withdrawal from the national team following the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ladić later continued to play for Croatia in the Euro 2000 qualifying and made seven out of possible eight appearances, eventually ending his international career after the final qualifying match against Yugoslavia on 9 October 1999 and Croatia's failure to qualify for the final tournament.\n\nHe briefly returned to the Croatian national team for their friendly match against France on 28 May 2000 in Zagreb to make the final appearance of his career, symbolically appearing in the opening ten minutes of the match. As this was his 59th match for the Croatian national team, he played it with an otherwise unusual shirt number 59.\n\nWhen Otto Barić took the charge of the Croatia national team in 2002, Ladić was appointed goalkeeping coach in his coaching staff. He left the post following the UEFA Euro 2004 finals in Portugal, along with the rest of the staff, as their contracts expired after the tournament and were not renewed following Croatia's failure to reach the quarter-finals.\n\nOn 9 August 2006, Ladić was appointed the head coach of the Croatia national under-21 team, replacing Slaven Bilić, who was appointed the head coach of the country's senior national team at the time.\n\nIn the early morning of 5 September 2010, hours after an under-21 international between Serbia and Croatia, Ladić was involved in a car accident when the Mercedes-Benz E-Class he was driving, collided with a Renault Clio at a Zagreb road intersection. Both cars were damaged beyond repair and three passengers in the Renault sustained serious injuries. Ladić escaped the accident unhurt. Some eyewitnesses of the accident accused Ladić of a red light violation, which he denied.\n\nHe was removed from his position in January 2011, when the Croatian Football Federation accused him of falsifying insurance documents following the car accident. However, within the federation there were, and still are, others who have been charged of felonies and have not been removed from their positions, sparking corruption claims within the media.\n\nIn March 2018 Ladić joined Croatia's coaching staff under the manager Zlatko Dalić, as the coach.\n\nIskra Bugojno\n\nDinamo Zagreb\n\n\n\n\n"}

He last played for Toulon and played for England.\n\nHe was born 1 September 1973 in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nAt , he is one of the tallest men to have played for England. Shaw has represented England at various levels including students and Under-21s. He played for Bristol at 17. This was despite not taking up the game seriously until he was 16, just after his family had moved to England from Spain. He was educated at Runnymede College, in Madrid and at Godalming College in Surrey. He also played for Cranleigh Rugby Club in his younger years, and often returns to train with the youth teams.\n\nDespite Shaw's hefty size, he was a very skilful and athletic player with good hands and an impressive ability to get around the field. He was also known for being very effective in the maul.\n\nShaw played for Bristol at the age of 17. He joined London Wasps in 1997. Wasps won the Tetley's Bitter Cup in 1999 and retained it the following season with a victory over the Northampton Saints. Playing against Bath in August 2000, Shaw became the only lock in the Premiership to have scored a drop goal.\n\nIn the 2002–03 Zurich Premiership Shaw won the Premiership for the first time, defeating Gloucester in the final. That season Shaw also won his first European silverware with victory against Bath in the 2002-03 Parker Pen Challenge Cup. The 2003-04 Zurich Premiership season saw Wasps retain their Premiership crown and win the 2003-04 Heineken Cup, their first Heineken Cup title.\n\nThe 2004–05 season saw Wasps win the Premiership for a third season in a row. The following season Wasps defeated the Scarlets to win the Powergen Cup.\n\nWasps defeated Leicester Tigers in the final of the 2006–07 Heineken Cup to become European Champions for the second time.\n\nThe following 2007–08 season saw Wasps defeat Leicester Tigers in a final again to regain the Premiership title.\n\nIn May 2008, playing against Leeds Carnegie in the last match of the regular season, Shaw became the first player ever to play in 200 Premiership matches.\n\nIn November 2011, Shaw decided to finish his career overseas and signed for French club, RC Toulonnais.\n\nHe won his first England cap against Italy in 1996. The following year Shaw was picked for the successful 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa. A spate of injuries and Wasps' indifferent form in his first season at the club cost him his England place and although he regained his place in the England squad for the following summer's tour, he was forced to withdraw with a long-standing back injury.\n\nDuring the 2000 Six Nations Championship, he had to step in for the injured Martin Johnson. He earned his 20th cap during the 2003 Six Nations Championship, a tournament which saw England win the Grand Slam. Shaw played in all three 2003 Rugby World Cup warm up matches. He was not named in the original 30-man squad but was flown out to Australia due to an injury to Danny Grewcock, earning him an MBE as part of the World Cup winning team. He keeps this in a drawer as he feels he didn't \"win\" it as he never played in a test.\nShaw was called up to the squad for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand after Irish lock Malcolm O'Kelly aggravated a groin injury in training.\n\nShaw was selected as a member of the England 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. Shaw played the full 80 minutes in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final.\n\nIn recognition of his continued good form with club and country, Shaw was selected for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. This made him the oldest person to ever be selected and play for a Lions team. In South Africa he was awarded his first Lions cap on his third tour when he was selected to start in the second test against the Springboks at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria and he put in one of the most outstanding performances by a British and Irish lock in a test match, with his performance subsequently earning him man of the match. During the third test in Johannesburg he was yellow-carded for dirty play when he knee-dropped Fourie du Preez. In 2004 he was red-carded for a similar offence against the All Blacks.\n\nIn August 2011 he was selected as part of England's 30-man squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIn 2011, Simon Shaw became a director of Rugby Hospitality company Set Piece Events.\n\n"}

It features the origin of the Fantastic Four and the team's first battle with the evil Doctor Doom. Executive-produced by low-budget specialist Roger Corman and Bernd Eichinger, the film was ultimately never released officially, but illegal copies began circulating after a few years.\n\nReed Richards and Victor von Doom are college friends who use the opportunity of a passing comet to try an experiment; however, the experiment goes wrong, leaving Victor believed dead. Susan and Johnny Storm are two children living with their mother, who has a boarding house where Reed lives. Ben Grimm is a family friend and a college buddy of Reed's.\n\nTen years later, Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben go up into an experimental spacecraft of Reed's as the same comet passes by Earth. They are hit by cosmic rays from it, due to a necessary diamond being exchanged for an imitation by the Jeweler.\n\nUpon crash-landing on Earth, the four discover that the cosmic rays gave them special powers: Reed's bodily structure has become elastic, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can generate fire on demand and Ben has transformed into a creature with stone-like skin: the Thing. They are later captured by Victor's men, who pose as Marines, and meet villainous monarch Dr. Doom. After escaping from Doom's men, the four regroup at the Baxter Building, trying to decide what to do now that they have gained superpowers. An angry Ben leaves the group to go out on his own, feeling he has become a freak of nature. He is found by homeless men and joins them in the lair of the Jeweler.\n\nThe Jeweler has his henchmen kidnap blind artist Alicia Masters, whom he plans to force into being his bride and intends to use the stolen diamond as his wedding gift to her. Doom has his own plans for the diamond and sends his henchmen to the Jeweler's lair to make a deal with him, to no avail. Doom, displeased, seizes the diamond himself as a gun battle breaks out between The Jeweler's and Doom's men. Ben enters the fray, only for Doom to take Alicia as his hostage. Ben threatens to 'clobber' Doom, only for Alicia to beg his not to risk it and confesses her love for him. Her confession reverts Ben to human form, causing him to flee out onto the city streets. Frustrated at his helplessness, he reverts to the Thing.\n\nBen returns to his friends; by now, Reed has learned that Doom is actually Victor. Doom contacts them and threatens to use the diamond to power a laser cannon that will destroy New York City, unless they surrender to him. Realizing they are the only ones who can stop Doom, they don costumes and travel to Doom's castle. There, the Fantastic Four battle a series of Doom's military. Doom fires his laser as Reed has a final battle with him, which ends with Doom being knocked off a balcony wall. He manages to grab hold of the wall and Reed attempts to rescue him, only for Doom's gauntlet to come loose and him falling into the fog below. His gauntlet, still on the balcony, starts to move on its own. Johnny becomes the Human Torch and flies off to stand between the laser's shot and the city, pushing the beam into outer space. Ben frees Alicia and finally introduces himself to her. She feels the rocky surface of his face but is not fazed by his altered appearance. Thereafter, the Four dedicate themselves to fighting evil, and Reed and Sue marry.\n\n\nIn 1983, German producer Bernd Eichinger met with Marvel Comics' Stan Lee at Lee's Los Angeles home to explore obtaining an option for a movie based on the Fantastic Four. The option was not available until three years later, when Eichinger's production company Constantin Film obtained it for a price the producer called \"not enormous\" and which has been estimated to be $250,000. Despite some interest from Warner Bros. Pictures and Columbia Pictures, budget concerns precluded any production, and with the option scheduled to expire on December 31, 1992, Constantin asked Marvel for an extension. With none forthcoming, Eichinger planned to retain his option by producing a low-budget \"Fantastic Four\" film. In September 1992, he teamed with B-movie specialist Roger Corman, who agreed to produce the film on a $1 million budget, to be released by his distribution company New Horizons Pictures.\n\nProduction began on December 28, 1992, under direction of music video director Oley Sassone. Storyboards were drawn by artist Pete Von Sholly. The 21-day or 25-day production was shot on the Concorde Pictures sound stage in Venice, California, as well as in Agoura, California for a spacecraft-crash scene, the Loyola Marymount University campus for a lab-explosion scene, and the former Pacific Stock Exchange building in downtown Los Angeles for team-meeting scenes.\n\nCostume designer Réve Richards recalled in 1993 going to Golden Apple Comics on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to buy \"Fantastic Four\" comic books for research, and, upon explaining his task, \"these people in the store just swarmed me and said, 'You are going to be faithful to it?' And I told them, 'This is why I am buying these books.'\" Paul Ahern was hired as weapons consultant, and Scott Billups for computer visual effects. The special-effects makeup was by John Vulich and Everett Burrell of Optic Nerve. Stuntman Carl Ciarfalio, who wore a rubber suit to portray the monstrous superhero Thing, worked with actor Michael Bailey Smith, who played the Thing's human self, Ben Grimm, so that their mannerisms would match. During the months of post-production, music composers David and Eric Wurst personally contributed $6,000 to finance a 48-piece orchestra for the soundtrack.\n\nA 1993 magazine article gave a tentative release date of Labor Day weekend 1993. During that summer, trailers ran in theaters and on the video release of Corman's \"Carnosaur\". The cast members hired a publicist, at their own expense, to help promote the film at a clips-screening at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and at the San Diego Comic-Con International, and the film appeared as a cover story on an issue of \"Film Threat\" magazine. By this time, the world premiere was announced to take place at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, on January 19, 1994, with proceeds from the event earmarked for the charities Ronald McDonald House and Children's Miracle Network.\n\nSuddenly, the premiere was halted, the actors received a cease and desist order on all promotion from the producers, and the studio confiscated the negatives. Eichinger then informed Sassone that the film would not be released. Speculation arose that the film had never been intended for release, but had gone into production solely as a way for Eichinger to retain rights to the characters; Stan Lee said in 2005 that this was indeed the case, insisting, \"The movie was never supposed to be shown to anybody,\" and adding that the cast and crew had been left unaware. Corman and Eichinger dismissed Lee's claims, with the former stating, \"We had a contract to release it, and I had to be bought out of that contract\" by Eichinger. Eichinger called Lee's version of events \"definitely not true. It was not our [original] intention to make a B movie, that's for sure, but when the movie was there, we wanted to release it.\" He said future Marvel film impresario Avi Arad, at this point, in 1993, a Marvel executive,\n\nArad recalled in 2002 that while on a trip to Puerto Rico in 1993, a fan noticing Arad's Fantastic Four shirt expressed excitement over the film's upcoming premiere, of which Arad said he was unaware. Concerned how the low-budget film might cheapen the brand, he said he purchased the film \"for a couple of million dollars in cash\" and, not having seen it, ordered all prints destroyed, in order to prevent its release.\n\nEichinger continued negotiations to produce a big-budget adaptation, speaking with directors including Chris Columbus, Peyton Reed, and Peter Segal. After pre-production briefly went underway in 1996, Eichinger and his company began production in 2004 of \"Fantastic Four\" (2005), with an estimated $90 million budget. Following that film's 2005 release, Eichinger and Constantin produced a $130 million sequel, \"\" (2007). A reboot for the film series was released in 2015.\n\nAlthough never officially released to the general public, but exhibited once on May 31, 1994, \"The Fantastic Four\" has been subject to bootleg recordings.\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 33%, based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 4.67/10. Clint Morris of \"Film Threat\" magazine said of a copy of the film he obtained, \"[Y]es it's terribly low-budget and yes it's derisorily campy and feebly performed, but at the same time there's also something inquiringly irresistible about this B comic tale that makes you wonder why it didn't get a release somewhere along the line. Even if it does resemble \"Toxic Avenger\" [more so] than say, \"Spider-Man\" ... The script isn't actually all that bad and some of the actors—notably Michael Bailey Smith—are actually quite good here, and with an extra polish I think they might have been able to release this thing.\" Neil Calloway of Flickering Myth said \"the production values are of a 1990s daytime soap, with some rather clunky dialogue.\"\n\nIn 2013 a main story arc in fourth season of the television series \"Arrested Development\" concerned the character Tobias Fünke's attempt to stage a musical based on The Fantastic Four. The setup for the story concerned his romantic relationship with an actress who had played Sue Storm in an unreleased Fantastic Four movie. This backstory parodies the development of the 1994 Corman movie and the storyline is an extended satire on various comic book rights battles.\n\nIn 2014, a trailer for the documentary \"\" was released, with Corman and the rest of the cast and crew explaining what transpired with the film and its production. The documentary was released on July 10, 2015.\n\n"}

His father was a professor at the University of Dorpat, and he studied also himself in the university. After his studies in Tartu, he moved to Erlangen to become a student of Felix Klein. He published his PhD thesis in 1875, and received the right to teach (venia legendi) at the university of Leipzig the same year. One year later he accepted a position at Technical University Darmstadt. In 1877 he married Elisabeth von Öttingen, and they moved to Dresden, where he acquired professorship in the Polytechnikum, which becomes a technical university in 1890.

{"id": "1925279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925279", "title": "Inkpen", "text": "Inkpen\n\nInkpen is a village and civil parish in West Berkshire southeast of Hungerford, most of the land of which is cultivated fields with scattered woodland which was once part of a former forest known as Savernake. Inkpen has boundaries with Wiltshire and Hampshire, including part of Walbury Hill, the highest point in England's South East.\n\nThe earliest record of Inkpen is in the Cotton Charter viii, dated between 931 and 939. This includes the will of a Saxon thegn named Wulfgar, whose name means \"wolf-spear\". Wulfgar owned \"\"land at inche penne\"\" which he \"\"had from Wulfric, who had it from Wulfhere who first owned it\"\", his father and grandfather respectively. Wulfgar left this to be divided amongst named heirs: three quarters to his wife, Aeffe, the other quarter to \"\"the servants of God\"\" at the holy place in Kintbury. Following Aeffe's death, her share was also to go to the holy place at Kintbury \"\"for the souls of Wulfgar, Wulfric and Wulfhere\"\".\n\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint Michael is 13th century. The east window of the chancel and west window of the nave were added in the 15th century. The church was restored by Clapton Crabb Rolfe in 1896; he added the south porch, south window and north aisle The church's new reredos, altar tables, Rood and rood screen, pulpit, lectern and much new seating were carved for Rolfe by Harry Hems of Exeter.\n\nNear the centre of the village just off Post Office Road is Inkpen Crocus Fields a large field of Mediterranean crocuses, one of only two in the UK. According to the information plaque, the plants are believed to have been brought here by the Knights Templar in the Middle Ages for the production of saffron. It is currently owned by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust.\n\nThe Old Rectory was built in 1695. Behind is a remarkable miniature Versailles garden inspired by the great French landscape architect, André Le Notre.\n\nKirby House was built in 1733 and West Court House in two stages in the 18th century. The Primary School was designed by G.E. Street and built in 1850.\n\nInkpen Post Office closed in the 1980s.\n\nBelow is a selection of subsequent spellings of a dictated Inkpen over a period of some three hundred years by various scribes:\n\n\nThe area was part of Savernake Forest, one of the first landscapes to reappear in all but southern-most Britain when the Ice Age receded at least 10,000 years ago. The ice left the deposits of heavy clay soil found in Inkpen that give rise to the occasionally saturated lowland areas. From the Downs, pockets of ancient woodland scattered in and around Inkpen persist.\n\nThe earliest sign of habitation in Inkpen dates to the Mesolithic period between 10,000 and 5500 BC. Only one artefact has been uncovered, to the west of the gibbet, but even this helps confirm the traditional view of small groups of Mesolithic people following established cyclic seasonal trails through the forested countryside, often along hilltops. They may have attempted to manipulate resources through forest clearance.\n\nThere were people living on the Downs of Inkpen some 5,000 years ago. Intact pots by the Beaker People have been unearthed at the Hungerford end of Craven Road in Inkpen, opposite Colnbrook Copse, as well as on the Downs. They show skill and artistic design and now reside in the West Berkshire Museum. Early Beaker People flint tools have been found close to the old saw mills at the end of Folly Road, along with evidence that suggests they were manufactured nearby. The pottery finds at Craven Road were found in a layer of sand close to where an ancient brook known as the \"Ingeflod\" would have run. At the bottom of the hill on the Hungerford Road leaving Inkpen, flooding in wet weather, still sometimes re-enacts the meanderings of this river through the fields to the northeast. It seems likely that this fresh water attracted the beaker people to settle and live in their round houses there, using the fertile soil for crops and livestock grazing. Evidence of an ancient field system is certainly still visible not far from the Inkpen Long Barrow.\n\nThe West Berkshire Museum has a number of bone tools and a bronze knife found in Inkpen that date from this period. In 1908 trenches dug at Sadler's Farm, the site of a ploughed-out barrow, revealed a large quantity of animal and some human bones, horns and some early or pre-Romano-British potsherds. The beaker people buried their dead in simple stone mounds since called round barrows, often with a beaker alongside the body. Several of these remain on the hilltop to the west of the Gibbet. Four were explored in 1908 when Neolithic tools and small urns with burnt human bones, suggesting cremation, were found. Later, in the Bronze Age, communal long barrows were used, like the one under Combe Gibbet.\n\nIn the Iron Age burial mounds and circles gave way to permanent fields and hill forts such as Walbury Camp on Walbury Hill adjacent to Gallows Down. It was built in around 600 BC and remained in use until about the time the Romans invaded Britain. The construction of its massive banks and ditches, encircling some , would have been an enormous feat. It would have been defended by a timber fence or palisade and populated with round houses and maybe pens for livestock. Walbury Camp was built, not only for the protection of the locals from attack by warring groups, but also in response to the increasing importance of the hilltop tracks for trade and the movement of livestock.\n\nThere is little evidence of Roman activity in Inkpen. Some of the hill trail trade was diverted down to the Ermin Way and Romanized Brythons certainly lived in the area. In 1984 archaeological finds were discovered near Lower Green suggesting the presence of a Roman dwelling of some kind, possibly not unlike the Roman villas found at nearby Kintbury and Littlecote. During building work near Combe in 2003, a Roman burial was found.\n\nThe Roman army withdrew from Britain in around AD 410 and the settlement of Anglo-Saxons from Denmark and Northern Germany followed soon afterward. At the foot of the Inkpen Beacon is what some believe to be the eastern end of the Wansdyke, a long ditch and bank (or linear defensive earthwork) built sometime between 400 and 700. Current theory suggests a date around AD 470 when some hill forts were being refortified by the Romano-Britons. It runs east-west between Inkpen Beacon and Portishead near Bristol. Although its eastern end is generally thought to be just south of Marlborough, this small section is named \"Wansdyke\" on Inkpen's enclosure award map of 1733. Its construction clearly points to danger from the north, perhaps from the first Saxons of what is now Berkshire, who settled around Abingdon. Early Saxon coins known as \"sceattas\" have been found on the Downs.\n\nInkpen has two public houses, the Crown & Garter and the Swan Inn, although the Swan Inn closed in April 2018 and was for sale as of December 2018. Both are hotels and have restaurants, and the Swan Inn had an organic food shop. The village has a monthly farmers' market.\n\nThere is a village hall. Inkpen Primary School has about sixty pupils.\n\nHalf of the crest of the highest point in the South East, Walbury Hill, is in the civil parish south of the village nucleus. The whole of the parish accordingly is in the North Wessex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty. At its summit, above sea-level, is Walbury Camp Iron Age hill fort, the start of the Test Way and the Wayfarers Walk. On the adjacent Gallows Down, but just within Combe parish, are Combe Gibbet and Inkpen Long Barrow.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925281", "title": "Jeholopterus", "text": "Jeholopterus\n\nJeholopterus was a small anurognathid pterosaur from the Middle to Late Jurassic Daohugou Beds of the Tiaojishan Formation of Inner Mongolia, China, preserved with hair-like pycnofibres and skin remains.\n\nThe genus was named in 2002 by Wang Xiaolin, Zhou Zhonghe and Xu Xing. The type species, the only known, is \"Jeholopterus ninchengensis\". The genus name is derived from its place of discovery, Jehol in China, and a Latinised Greek \"pteron\", \"wing\". The specific name refers to Nincheng County.\n\nThe type species is based on holotype IVPP V12705, a nearly complete specimen from the Daohugou beds of Ningcheng County in the Neimongol (Inner Mongolia) Autonomous Region of China. The specimen is crushed into a slab and counterslab pair, so that parts of the specimen are preserved on one side of a split stone and some on the other. This includes exquisite preservation of carbonized skin fibers and pycnofibres. The fibers are preserved around the body of the specimen in a \"halo.\" Wing tissue is preserved, though its extent is debatable, including the exact points of attachment to the legs (or if it is attached to the legs at all). In 2009 Alexander Kellner published a study reporting the presence of three layers of fibers in the wing, allowing the animal to precisely adapt the wing profile.\n\nAs an anurognathid, \"Jeholopterus\" shows the skull form typical for this group, being wider than it was long (28 mm), with a very broad mouth. Most teeth are small and peg-like, but some are longer and recurved. The neck was short with seven or eight cervical vertebrae. Twelve or thirteen dorsal vertebrae are present and three sacrals. There are five pairs of belly ribs. The tail vertebrae have not been preserved. The describers argue that \"Jeholopterus\" had a short tail, a feature seen in other anurognathids but unusual for \"rhamphorhynchoid\" (i.e. basal) pterosaurs that typically have a long tail. Wang \"et al.\" cited the presence of a fringe of pycnofibres in the region of the tail to infer the presence of a short tail. However, a subsequent study by Dalla Vecchia argued that gleaning any information about the tail is impossible, given that the tail is \"totally absent\" in the fossil.\nThe wing bones are robust. The metacarpals are very short. A short pteroid, supporting a propatagium, is pointing towards the body. The hand claws are long and curved. The wings of \"Jeholopterus\" show evidence that they attached to the ankle, according to Wang \"et al.\". They are relatively elongated with a wingspan of ninety centimetres.\n\nThe legs are short but robust. The toes bear well-developed curved claws, but these are not as long as the hand claws. The fifth toe is elongated, according to the authors supporting a membrane between the legs, the uropatagium.\n\n\"Jeholopterus\" was by the authors assigned to the Anurognathidae. An analysis by Lü Junchang in 2006 resolved its position as being the sister taxon of \"Batrachognathus\". Kellner et al. 2009 proposed Batrachognathinae for the clade comprising these two genera and \"Dendrorhynchoides\".\n\nAnurognathids are normally considered insectivores. Wang e.a. hypothesised that \"Jeholopterus\", being the largest species known of the group, might also have been a piscivore, a fish-eater.\n\nIn 2003, natural history writer David Peters, widely known for his highly inaccurate reconstructions and theories about most vertebrates, proposed \"Jehelopterus\" to be a hematophagic animal akin to a vampire bat. This theory has been widely condemned and ridiculed by the palaeontological community.\n\n"}

Operated by RTC Transit, it began service on October 27, 2005. Originally \"The Deuce\" meant four things: (1) buses on the route were double decked; (2) the one-way fare was $2; (3) the route served the two primary gaming areas, the Strip and Downtown; and (4) the first batch of vehicles bought primarily for the service were assigned fleet numbers starting with \"2\". Although the double decker buses also serve other local routes and the price is no longer $2, the name \"The Deuce on the Strip\" is used by RTC to emphasize that the route refers to just the tourist route.\n\nBefore the Deuce's debut, the Las Vegas Strip corridor was served by route 301, which ran between Downtown Las Vegas and the former Vacation Village resort. It was also accompanied by its express counterpart, route 302. (When the transit authority was branded as Citizens Area Transit (or CAT), it categorized routes serving the Strip under the 300's.)\n\nIn March 2010 a new bus rapid transit line connecting the Strip to downtown Las Vegas and Town Square and the South Strip Transfer Terminal became operational. This new 11 mile service was called ACE Gold Line and is similar to the Metropolitan Area Express BRT Line which has been operating since June 30, 2004. Due to a lawsuit by Ace Cab, the line was rebranded as the Gold Line. On November 7, 2010, it was rebranded to be known as the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX).\n\nPreviously, RTC planned to shorten The Deuce on the Strip from the current 9.3 miles to just the 5 miles of the Strip from Mandalay Bay Casino to Palace Station on Sahara Avenue. This would have been the first time in 45 years (including Las Vegas Transit System) that the main Strip corridor route had undergone a major route change and be shortened. However, the first week of the service change, the northern portion of the route was reinstated with buses continuing to serve the Downtown Transportation Center.\n\nAs of 2014, the fare \"for the Las Vegas Strip\" is $6 for a two-hour pass, $8 for a 24-hour pass, or $20 for a 72-hour pass.\n\nThe route operates using Alexander Dennis Enviro500 vehicles built by the British manufacturer Alexander Dennis. They each seat 27 people on the lower deck, 53 on the upper deck, and are 40 feet long. RTC Transit is one of five transit agencies that operate double-decker buses in the United States for fixed-route services, the others being Unitrans of Davis, California; Community Transit of Snohomish County, Washington; Antelope Valley Transit Authority of Palmdale, California and Lancaster, California; and SLO Transit of San Luis Obispo, CA. All of the five agencies reside on the west coast.\n\nIn 2006, the RTC announced that they purchased 40 more double-deckers that arrived in Spring 2007, and another 40 that arrived in 2008. These new vehicles replaced the original 50 that have been serving the Strip. The original vehicles were reassigned to local routes (height permitting). These new Deuces are special in that they have 2 staircases, one in the current position, and a second one in the back. They are also 2 feet longer than the present double deckers, and have earned the nickname \"Superdeuce.\"\n\nSince January 2008, 80 new double deckers have arrived with half of that order featuring the reconfigured 42 ft, double staircase bus. The double staircase buses are assigned mostly to The Strip, while some, as well as all of the 40 ft double deckers are assigned to local routes. Although rare, some of the 40 ft vehicles will find their way onto The Strip route as a last resort.\n\n\n"}

Total prize money for the race is A$400,000.\n\nThe first Adelaide Cup was raced on 21 April 1864 at Thebarton Racecourse, where Mile End is today. The race had stakes of 500 sovereigns with an additional sweep of 50 sovereigns to induce owners from other colonies to compete in the race. Victoria's P. Dowling's Falcon carried 10 stone 1 pound and ridden by jockey J.Morrison won the race in a time of 3:50.50. A crowd of 7,000 or 8,000 was present for the event.\n\nThe race was run at Weight for Age over two miles from 1864–68.\nIn 1869, still at Thebarton Racecourse, it was run as a handicap race over two miles. There was no Cup raced in 1870 or 1871. \nThe Cup resumed in 1872 and was run at \"The Old Course\" (Victoria Park Racecourse) over two miles with a smaller stake of 200 sovereigns and an additional sweep of 15 sovereigns. In 1876 the race was held at Morphettville Racecourse. In 1884 the race was run over 13 furlongs or miles (~2,600 metres), as was every race held until 1941.\n\nThe Totalizator, whose operation on South Australian racecourses became legal in 1880, was abolished by the Totalizator Repeal Act of 1883, and the SAJC suffered a financial collapse. The racecourse was mortgaged and the 1885 Adelaide Cup was held at Flemington, Victoria, and was not held for three more years. In 1889, running of the Cup resumed at Morphettville when Sir Richard Baker and A. O. Whitington took over the course.\n\nStarting on 1 March 1942, there was a ban on racing due to World War II and thus the race was not held in 1942 and 1943.\n\nIn 1980 due to renovation of Morphettville Racecourse the race was run at Victoria Park Racecourse and in 2000 the Cup race day was abandoned due to rain and was rescheduled later and also run at Victoria Park.\n\nThe highest ever Cup attendance was in 1951 when 50,000 spectators attended.\n\nThe cup is held on the second Monday of March since March 2006. Before 2006 it was held in May. It was first run in 1864, just three years after the Melbourne Cup commenced.\nThe day received public holiday status in 1973 and became a major social event in South Australia. In the decade since the move of the Adelaide Cup to March, attendance has fallen to a third of previous levels, seeing 10,500 people trackside in 2015. This is due to use of the public holiday by other \"Mad March\" events (the Adelaide Festival of the Arts, the associated Fringe Festival, the WOMAD world music festival, a touring car race the weekend prior). Thoroughbred Racing SA and the South Australian Jockey Club wish to move the race and its associated public holiday out of March. However the South Australian government Minister for Racing said \"We can't be at the whim of a racing club that wants to dictate when the public holiday is going to be\" and suggests if the race be moved again then it be held on a Saturday.\n\nThe race was a Principal Race from 1864 until 1979 and a Group 1 race from 1979 until 2006.\nThe race was downgraded from Group 1 to Group 2 status following a decision by the Australian Pattern Committee in 2007.\n\n† Race not held due to a ban on war time racing in the state.\n‡ Race held at Flemington, Victoria after financial collapse of the SAJC which followed the Totalizator Repeal Act 1883.\n\n"}

As a result, it is recommended when this name is encountered to check what the author means.\n\nHowever, in the northern temperate regions the name is unambiguous as the only representative is \"Tilia\", the lime or linden.\n\nIn the de Candolle system the circumscription of the family was:\n\nAccording to APG II system, the current placement of these genera is mostly in the 'new' Malvaceae sensu lato, but with \"Gyrostemon\" moved to family Gyrostemonaceae, \"Muntingia\" to family Muntingiaceae, \"Sloanea\" to family Elaeocarpaceae, \"Vatica\" to family Dipterocarpaceae and \"Wikstroemia\" to family Thymelaeaceae (possibly reduced to a synonym of \"Daphne\").

Modern botanical taxonomy, such as the relevant volume in the Kubitzki series which conforms to APG, treats most of the plants that traditionally constitute the family (see above) in the subfamilies Tilioideae, Brownlowioideae, and Grewioideae within this extended family Malvaceae sensu lato.

It occupies an approximate rectangle of land south of the (Old) Bath Road (A4) between Reading, its nearest town and Thatcham. It has several small clusters of homes and woodland covering about a fifth of the land, in the centre and north beside which is Thames Valley Police's main Training Centre at Sulhamstead House. Its main amenities are its Church of England parish church and a shop and visitor centre by the Kennet & Avon Canal.\n\nSulhamstead's immediate neighbours toward its northern border, the A4 road, are much more populous Theale which has the nearest Theale and shops and similarly low density Ufton Nervet. Across this road is very low population and housing density Englefield.\n\nA dispersed village, it has five clusters of homes. The greatest of these is linear, on Sulhamstead Hill (road) from the top of the hill by Ufton Church down to the water meadows by the Kennet and the Bath Road (A4). Three further developed points are diminutive Sulhamstead Abbots, Whitehouse Green and Sulhamstead Bannister. Lastly the northwestern corner of Burghfield Common village is in the far south, the remainder of the village part of Burghfield.\n\nSulhamstead Abbots Church, St Mary's, to the south, is the active ecclesiastical parish church. Sulhamstead Bannister forms the narrowly buffered halves: \"Upper End\" and \"Lower End\". Upper End is between Wokefield and Grazeley, although this has since been absorbed into Wokefield civil parish. The core of its village was around the old demolished church, where the inventor Samuel Morland's father was once the vicar.\n\nBefore 1782, Sulhamstead consisted of two ecclesiastical parishes, Sulhamstead Abbots and Sulhamstead Bannister, approximate to the boundaries of the manors of the same name before medieval and later subdivision.\n\nThe name Sulhamstead means 'Narrow Valley Homestead' and was given to the area by the first Saxon settlers. There is supposed to have been a Danish Camp of some sort there during the troubled times just before and during King Alfred's reign.\n\nBan(n)ister was the name of the Lords of the Manor from the early 12th century. They were still holding lands here three hundred years later, and had another important manor in Finchampstead. The Upper End was, however, often called Meales and Meales Farm, a reputed manor, stands next to the site of the Church of St. Michael from which its name derives.\n\nA congregational chapel/church was built in 1881 in place of an older chapel. The inclosure of the two parishes of Sulhamstead Abbots and Sulhamstead Bannister was made by Act of Parliament, effective 1817.\n\nGrazeley was a tithing in the parish of Sulhamstead Abbots containing of . In 1854, when the manorial estate of Grazeley was advertised for sale, it was inclosed in a ring fence and apparently included the whole tithing.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, 8 gold coins from a single treasure hoard were discovered at an undisclosed location near Sulhamstead. The coins are estimated as having been buried between 20-30 BC. Six of these coins are quarter staters, similar to some others found in Berkshire and Wiltshire. The remaining two are believed to have originated from North West France. As of 2019, the coins are on display in the West Berkshire Museum, and will continue to be displayed in the museum's 'Hoards' exhibition throughout 2019.\n\nOn August 15, 2019, the A4 near Sulhamstead was the location of the murder of a Police Officer of the Thames Valley Police Roads Policing Unit, who was responding to reports of a local burglary.\n\nSulhamstead House, commonly known as the White House, was the manor house of Sulhamstead Abbots. It was built by Daniel May, son of the Basingstoke brewer, Charles May, in 1744, becoming home to his sister's descendants, the Thoyts family.\n\nThe house was largely rebuilt in 1800 for William Thoyts, the High Sheriff of Berkshire. It was the childhood home of his great granddaughter, Berkshire historian and palaeographer, Emma Elizabeth Thoyts (1860–1949). It refurbishment was paid for in 1910 by William G Watson, created a baronet (territorial designation: of Sulhamstead). The baronetcy is extinct.\n\nIn 1949, the house became the headquarters of the Berkshire Constabulary. Since their merger into Thames Valley Police, it has functioned as that force's training centre and houses the Thames Valley Police Museum. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe Sulhamstead estate is owned by the Astor family.\n\nThis was built around a small timber-framed cottage dating to around 1650, which was gradually enlarged into a farm house and now survives as a small wing of the house. The house was transformed in 1906 by Arts and Crafts architect Edwin Lutyens into a country home for H. H. Cochrane. It was extended, by Lutyens, for Zachary Merton, six years later. It is one of Lutyens' best-known house designs. Lutyens collaborated with Gertrude Jekyll to make the diverse, multi-level garden. Folly Farm is Grade I listed, being the highest category, as it is an exceptional example of Arts and Craft architecture.\n\nThe church of St Mary (formerly St Bartholomew) dates from the 13th century and is Grade I listed.\n\nThe active village hall for Sulhamstead and Ufton is halfway down the road Sulhamstead Hill, built in 1927.\n\nSulhamstead Lock, Tyle Mill and Tyle Mill Lock on the Kennet & Avon Canal have a wharf, lock and swing bridge. The singer-songwriter Kate Bush lived in a large canalside home for several years until 2004.\nOmer's Gully Wood is next to the north-west corner of more populous Burghfield Common village. The most part is owned by the Englefield (Manor) Estate and the remainder by the Local Authority. The wood covers 3.6 hectares. The woodland has been well coppiced for firewood in the past. 86 different plant species and 46 different birds have been found and it is a recorded habitat for mammals including foxes, deer, badgers, squirrels and rabbits. The woodland links up with other woodland by Omers Brook, such as Clayhill Copse to the north east as part of a larger natural woodland covered habitat.\n\n"}
{"id": "1925353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925353", "title": "Scott Norton", "text": "Scott Norton\n\nScott Norton (born June 15, 1961) is an American semi-retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenures in World Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro-Wrestling.\n\nNorton started out as a professional arm wrestler. He won over 30 championships during his days as an arm wrestler, including four U.S. National championships, and gained the nickname \"Flash\" due to his quickness in winning matches. His status in the arm wrestling world earned him a role in Sylvester Stallone's arm wrestling movie, \"Over the Top\". While touring the arm wrestling circuit in Japan, Norton was approached by New Japan Pro-Wrestling about becoming a professional wrestler, but he turned it down initially. In addition to his professional arm wrestling career, Norton also worked as a bodyguard for Prince during the musician's 1999 and Purple Rain Tours.\n\nAfter finally deciding to enter professional wrestling, Norton was trained to wrestle by former Olympic wrestler Brad Rheingans. Despite Norton's inexperience, Verne Gagne decided to debut him before he was totally finished with his training, putting him on television as a regular performer for the American Wrestling Association in 1989. He sometimes teamed with John Nord as the Yukon Lumberjacks. He challenged then World Champions Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and Larry Zbyszko to an TV arm wrestling match. If anyone beat him, he would pay them (kayfabe) $1,000,000. Nothing became of the challenge. By the end of 1989, Norton left the AWA and went to the Pacific Northwest territory to further his career. In PNW, Norton started out as a face with a lumberjack gimmick and the nickname \"Flapjack\". He soon formed a tag team with John Nord once more to reprise their lumberjack gimmick from the AWA. In 1990, Norton turned heel and broke away from Nord to become a singles competitor. He won the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship from Brian Adams on May 12, 1990, but was stripped of the title two weeks later after attacking several wrestlers.\n\nIn 1990, Norton signed with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Upon debuting for the promotion, Norton alternated between tag team and mid-card singles matches. Norton appeared at both the joint NJPW/World Championship Wrestling Starrcade in Egg Dome shows, giving him exposure to WCW executives.\n\nThe working agreement between NJPW and WCW meant that The Steiner Brothers would tour Japan on a regular basis, often wrestling against Scott Norton alongside a variety of partners. On November 5, 1991 Norton acted as a substitute for the injured Scott Steiner in an IWGP Tag Team Championship match. Norton and Rick Steiner were unsuccessful on the night and lost the tag-team titles to Hiroshi Hase and Keiji Mutoh. About a year after losing the title he never technically held, Norton won the Tag Team Title properly when he and Tony Halme beat the Steiner Brothers for the gold on November 22, 1992. The powerhouse team only held on to the title for a little over three weeks before losing them to the Hell Raisers (Road Warrior Hawk and Power Warrior).\n\nAfter splitting up with Halme, Norton started to team with Hercules Hernandez in March 1993. Hercules was a fellow powerhouse wrestler and the two formed The Jurassic Powers, a team that won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from the Hell Raisers. The Powers held the title for about four months before losing them back to the Hell Raisers at NJPW's January 4 Dome Show. While holding the title, the Jurassic Powers successfully defended against teams such as Keiji Mutoh and Hiroshi Hase, The Nasty Boys, Takayuki Iizuka and Akira Nogami, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts and Brutus Beefcake, Masa Saito and Manabu Nakanishi and The Barbarian and Haku in non-title competition. The team also and made it to the finals of the 1993 Super Grade Tag League, where they lost to Keiji Mutoh and Hiroshi Hase.\n\nAfter breaking up with Hernandez, Norton failed to achieve much notoriety in the singles ranks nor in the tag team division, where he teamed with a variety of partners such as Mike Enos, Ron Simmons, Masahiro Chono, Osamu Kido, and Road Warrior Hawk.\n\nNorton returned to the U.S. and signed with World Championship Wrestling in 1993. The promoters first tried to get Norton over with the fans as a villain by feuding with Sting, but Norton quit before Slamboree 1993 and was replaced by the Prisoner.\n\nNorton made an appearance on a WWF house show in Sunrise, Florida on October 9, 1994. He was defeated by Thurman \"Sparky\" Plugg.\n\nNorton returned to WCW in September 1995, where he briefly feuded with Shark, after the latter inadvertently helped Randy Savage defeat Norton on the September 11 edition of \"WCW Monday Nitro\".\n\nDuring a WCW \"Saturday Night\" taping, Norton squared off against Ice Train. The bout ended in a double count out when both men clotheslined the other, knocking each out. After the match, the two shook hands and Norton explained to announcer Gene Okerlund that he felt that they would make a formidable tag team because of their similar wrestling styles. The team was quickly named Fire and Ice. At Slamboree, Norton and Ice Train were randomly drawn to be on the same team and easily defeated the makeshift team of Big Bubba Rogers and Stevie Ray. The team advanced to the \"Lord of The Ring\" battle royal, but neither won the match.\n\nAt The Great American Bash, Fire and Ice came head to head with Norton's long-time rivals, the Steiner Brothers. The two teams was engaged in a mini-feud of sorts, as the two teams tried to show who was better powerhouse team. On that night the Steiner Brothers won, but Fire and Ice were not deterred. After a pre-PPV loss to The Rock 'n' Roll Express at Bash at the Beach, dissension started to appear between the two, a dissension that turned into battle as Norton attacked Ice Train after another team loss. Norton defeated the Ice Train at Hog Wild in a submission match, but lost to Ice Train in a rematch a month later.\n\nAfter Fire and Ice ended, Norton split his time between WCW and NJPW, achieving more success in NJPW than WCW most notably in the tag team division. Norton and Shinya Hashimoto teamed up and won the Super Grade Tag League in 1996 after beating Keiji Mutoh and Rick Steiner in the finals.\n\nIn late 1996, Norton joined the New World Order (nWo), which gave his WCW career some direction after the breakup of Fire and Ice. In the nWo, Norton teamed with Buff Bagwell as Vicious and Delicious. They feuded with the Steiner Brothers, but were never able to win the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nDuring his nWo days, Norton traveled back and forth to NJPW, where he was a member of nWo Japan, and became NJPW's gaijin ace while also becoming one of the few wrestlers to be a regular member of both factions. On September 23, 1998, he won the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship by defeating Yuji Nagata. Norton's title win was mentioned only once in America on a broadcast of \"Nitro\" while he was seen holding the belt, but Norton's standing in the WCW version of the nWo never changed from this fact mostly due to the nWo's leader being Hollywood Hogan, who was the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Norton held the IWGP Heavyweight Title for four months before losing the title to Keiji Mutoh. Norton is one of nine foreigners who ever held the IWGP Championship, the others being Big Van Vader, Salman Hashimikov, Bob Sapp, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, AJ Styles, Kenny Omega and Jay White.\n\nNorton soon began playing a smaller role in WCW, becoming part of the nWo \"B-Team\", which often placed him in mid-lower card matches; although he would continue to squash jobbers frequently in singles competition. While in NJPW, however, Norton was seen as a main eventer and constant threat to world champions. He left WCW completely in 1999 after losing a match against Goldberg on the September 30 episode of \"Thunder\" and began focusing his efforts on NJPW, where he was part of Masahiro Chono's Team 2000.\n\nOn March 17, 2001, Norton defeated Kensuke Sasaki in Nagoya, Japan to capture the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship a second time. His second reign was shorter than his first, and he lost to Kazuyuki Fujita on his first defense. After the loss, Norton started to team with fellow WCW alumnus Rick Steiner whenever Steiner toured Japan, but otherwise he was planted solidly in the mid-card as a test any hopeful world title challenger would have to pass. After briefly retiring in 2004, Norton returned later that year and resumed teaming with Steiner. Following the 2006 New Japan Cup, he left NJPW after 16 years, becoming a freelancer in the process.\n\nIn mid-2006, Norton started his own independent promotion, Wild West Championship Wrestling, based in the southwest of United States, where he acted as both a booker and wrestler until its closure later that year.\n\nAfter wrestling for Hustle from mid to late 2007, Norton took a near-year long hiatus before returning on October 24, 2008, where he and Masahiro Chono defeated Don Frye and Yoshihiro Takayama in the first part of the Pro Wrestling Expo. The next day, Norton, Frye and Dick Togo lost to Chono, Eric Young and Kohei Sato. Since then, Norton has been inactive from wrestling.\n\nIn an August 2010 interview, Norton revealed that he would be interested in a run with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. At the time, Norton lived in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is located minutes outside of TNA's headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee and commented that wrestling is, \"something I enjoy doing. You miss it. I can still perform at a high level. I’m still a big, strong man. I would like to give it another shot. If I can get a couple-year run, I'll fold up my tent and call it a day.\"\n\nOn October 7, 2012, Norton teamed with Keiji Mutoh to defeat the team of Masanobu Fuchi and Taiyo Kea in a tag team match on the first event of All Japan Pro Wrestling's 40th Anniversary Tour.\n\nNorton returned to NJPW on January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, taking part in the New Japan Rumble, from which he was eliminated by Michael Elgin. The following day, Norton teamed with Cheeseburger and former nWo Japan stablemates Hiro Saito, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima in a ten-man tag team, where they defeated Bullet Club (Bad Luck Fale, Bone Soldier, Kenny Omega, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa).\n\nOn April 29, 2017, Norton faced NYWC Heavyweight Champion Bull James at April Reign in a losing effort.\n\nNorton is married to his wife Tammy. His book, \"Scott Norton: Strong Style\", with assistance from Adam Randis, who has been a longtime fan of Norton, was released on May 25, 2019.\n\nGrowing up in Minnesota, Norton became friends with a number of future fellow professional wrestlers, including Road Warrior Hawk, Curt Hennig, Rick Rude, John Nord and Wayne Bloom.\n\n"}

Originally there were six members: Rupert Browne (vocals), Ed East (rhythm guitar), Steve Bond (drums), Simon (Boris) Exton (keyboards), Luke Sherwood (lead guitar) and Trevor Wensley (saxophone). Originally called \"Rupert & The Beards\", the band have been playing together for over 15 years. After Sherwood left the band, Wensley became a second keyboard/synth player. As there was no bass player the two keyboards shared rhythm, bass and melody duties. All five members write the songs. An early EP, \"Telephone Heroes\", was followed by their first album, \"Experiment with Mother\". Recorded at home, it was released by Bristol Label Sink and Stove Records along with the single \"Like It Or Leave It”. Having gigged regularly for many years around Bristol they began to play further a-field. This led to them acquiring management and subsequently signing a deal with Island Records. The band recorded the album \"Lick Your Ticket\" in 2003 with producer Steve Osborne at Realworld Studios. They released a number of singles from it and toured extensively, playing with bands such as Kasabian (other than in Southampton), the Kaiser Chiefs and The Charlatans as well as at Glastonbury and V festivals. However, they were unable to sell enough records to make a sufficient return on the large investment Island had made in them and their contract was not extended to another album.\n\nWhilst working in Berlin with dance producers Tiefschwarz they were seen performing by Kitty-Yo Records who signed the album up for release in GAS. Their next album, \"Brace, Brace\" was licensed by Weekender among other labels. Produced by Bruno Ellingham this album featured the single, \"You Said\" which enjoyed airplay and allowed the band to play a large number of gigs across Europe.

He graduated from Austin High School in Austin, Texas, before attending Texas Lutheran University (formerly Texas Lutheran College), where he was one of the founders of the Omega Tau Fraternity in 1958 before graduating in 1962. He is now a member of the Board of Regents for his alma mater.\n\nLundquist attended Augustana Seminary in Rock Island, Illinois in 1962. His father was a Lutheran pastor and President of the Nebraska Synod of the Augustana Lutheran Church. Lundquist played basketball and baseball and was a disc jockey at WOC, Davenport, Iowa. His 'Golden Voice' was the highlight of the seminary class on preaching.\n\nHe began his broadcasting career as sports anchor for WFAA in Dallas and in Austin for KTBC, as well as being the radio voice of the Dallas Cowboys. Lundquist joined the Cowboys Radio Network in 1967 and remained with the team until the 1984 season. He was paired with future (and now current) play-by-play man Brad Sham starting with the 1977 season, the year the Cowboys went 12–2 and captured their second NFL title in Super Bowl XII. He was sportscaster at WFAA during their 6pm news, while his eventual successor Dale Hansen did the 10pm news.\n\nBefore becoming a nationwide sports commentator, from 1970 to 1974, Lundquist was commentator for the sports show, \"Bowling for Dollars\", in Dallas, Texas. It aired weekday evenings on the ABC station, WFAA-TV, from 6:30 to 7:00, in north central Texas. During these four seasons, Lundquist started interviewing Cowboys players and their first head coach, Tom Landry, at their sidelines, during halftimes, practices, pre-season and pre-game warm-ups, in Dallas. \n\nNationally, Lundquist worked for ABC Sports from 1974 to 1981, CBS from 1982 to 1995, and TNT cable from 1995 to 1997 before returning to CBS in 1998. Lundquist's patented belly laugh and his contagious enthusiasm for the events he covers have made him one of the more prominent and recognizable on-air talents in network TV.\n\nHe is among the key voices of NFL Films, and in past years had called regional NFL games for CBS, NBA games for CBS and TNT, and TNT's \"Sunday Night Football\" telecasts. He called television play-by-play on Seattle Seahawks preseason games from 2006 to 2008. \n\nDuring the 1992, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics, whose rights were held by CBS and TNT, Lundquist and Scott Hamilton served as the announcers for figure skating events. Their performances were parodied by \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members Phil Hartman and Darrell Hammond (as Lundquist) with Dana Carvey, David Spade, and Will Ferrell (both as Hamilton): in 1992 with Jason Priestley and 1994 with Nancy Kerrigan and Chris Farley. They did a spoof of the Olympics figure skating events, as both Hartman and Myers went \"Oh!\" when Priestly or Farley (in a pre-recorded performance) did an on-ice pratfall. Lundquist, after seeing the original footage in 1992, commented that Hartman \"nailed it dead on.\"\n\nLundquist filled in for Ernie Johnson Jr. as host of TNT's coverage of the PGA Championship twice, in 2006 as Johnson was battling cancer, and in 2011 when Johnson left after the second round following the death of his father on that Friday night.\n\nAfter his return to CBS, Lundquist served as the long-time lead play-by-play announcer for CBS Sports' coverage of college football on the \"SEC on CBS\" from 2000–2016.\n\nLundquist retired from broadcasting college football games after calling the Army–Navy Game on December 10, 2016. He planned to contribute to other CBS Sports programs, including its college basketball and golf coverage, for the foreseeable future. \n\nIn March 2018, Lundquist announced he would not work the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, as he was still recovering from back surgery he had in November 2017, and would retire from calling college basketball.\n\nDespite his retirement from calling college football and basketball, Lundquist remains active as an announcer, calling The Masters and the PGA Championship for CBS Sports in 2018 and 2019.\n\nCurrently, Lundquist resides in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.\n\nLundquist played himself commentating on golf tournaments in the 1996 motion picture \"Happy Gilmore\".\n\nLundquist was a play-by-play announcer in the \"NBA Live 98\" video game and was also the play-by-play announcer in the \"College Hoops 2K8\" video game.\n\nA famous pet phrase Lundquist uses on occasion is \"\"How do you DO!\"\"; on a huge offensive or defensive play, a phrase he took from USC football broadcaster Pete Arbogast (who in turn took the phrase from venerable broadcaster Vin Scully). \n\nAt the 2005 Sun Bowl, Lundquist was inducted into the Sun Bowl Hall of Fame along with former UCLA Bruins football coach Terry Donahue.\n\nFrom 1977–1983, the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Lundquist as Texas Sportscaster of the Year for his accomplishments from his time in Dallas. The organization later inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nIn broadcasting circles, Lundquist is affectionately known as \"The Golden Throat\".\n\nIn May 2012, Lundquist delivered the commencement address at Hampden-Sydney College, an honor he calls \"one of the true achievements of my lifetime.\"\n\nLundquist is on the Board of Directors of the summer music festival, Strings Music Festival in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.\n\nOn October 22, 2016, Lundquist was a Celebrity Guest Picker on \"College GameDay\" on ESPN.\n\nLundquist has had many broadcasting partners over his long career, including:\n"}

Fifteen were built, and one has survived to preservation. Originally known as the Big Goods class, they became class I under Peter Drummond's 1901 classification scheme.\n\nFifteen locomotives were built by Sharp, Stewart and Company and delivered between September and November 1894, numbered 103 to 117. At the time, these were the most powerful main line engines in the country. Originally intended principally as freight engines, they were often called upon for passenger duties during the wide fluctuations of traffic which occurred on the Highland Railway, particularly during the summer season.\n\nThe 4-6-0 wheel arrangement had its origins in the United States, and its introduction to Britain was the work of the Highland Railway's locomotive superintendent David Jones. When the 'Jones Goods' first appeared they were felt to be somewhat daring as they were such an advance on anything that Jones or the Highland Railway had previously built.\n\nAlthough the type was a notable success for Jones, an accident while testing one of the locomotives caused one of his legs to be severely scalded. Although he recovered, he was permanently affected and by the end of December 1896 had retired due to ill-health.\n\nBoiler pressure was — the previous highest on the Highland being . Outside cylinders were , bore by stroke – the previous largest being . Driving wheels were in diameter — the HR standard for freight locomotives. Additionally the boiler and chassis were significantly longer than anything previously attempted by the company. It was also the first tender locomotive for the railway not to have Allan double frames and inclined cylinders beside the smokebox.\n\nThe class was numbered 17916–17930 and given power classification '4F' by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). They were withdrawn between 1929 and 1940.\n\nNumber 103 (LMS 17916) was set aside for preservation by the LMS in 1934. It was restored to working order by British Railways in 1959 and spent several years operating enthusiasts' tours. During this time, it appeared in the 1965 film \"Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines\". It was finally retired in 1966 and is today in the Glasgow Museum of Transport. In addition to being the first ever British 4-6-0, no. 103 has since 1966 also had the less positive distinction of being the only surviving former Highland Railway locomotive.\n\n\n"}

He was Minister of Science and Development in the 1980s and early 1990s. He was the President of Tel Aviv University from 1971 to 1977. He was awarded the Israel Prize in the field of exact sciences (which he returned in 1992 in protest of the award of the Israel Prize to Emile Habibi), the Albert Einstein Award, the Wigner Medal, and the EMET Prize for Arts, Sciences and Culture.\n\nYuval Ne'eman was born in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era, graduated from high school at the age of 15, and studied mechanical engineering at the Technion.\n\nAt the age of 15, Ne'eman also joined the Haganah. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Ne'eman served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as battalion deputy commander, then as Operations Officer of Tel Aviv, and commander of Givati Brigade.\n\nLater (1952–54) he served as Deputy Commander of Operations Department of General Staff, Commander of the Planning Department of the IDF. In this role, he helped organize the IDF into a reservist-based army, developed the mobilization system, and wrote the first draft of Israel's defense doctrine.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1960 Ne'eman was IDF Attaché in Great Britain, where he also studied for a PhD in physics under the supervision of 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics winner Abdus Salam at Imperial College London. In 1961, he was demobilized from the IDF with a rank of Colonel.\n\nIn 1981, Ne'eman became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.\n\nBetween 1998-2002 Ne'eman was the head of the Israeli Engineer Association \n\nOne of his greatest achievements in physics was his 1961 discovery of the classification of hadrons through the SU(3) flavour symmetry, now named the \"Eightfold Way\", which was also proposed independently by Murray Gell-Mann. This SU(3) symmetry laid the foundation of the quark model, proposed by Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964 (independently of each other).\nNe'eman was founder and director of the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel Aviv University from 1965 to 1972, President of Tel Aviv University from 1971 to 1977 (following George S. Wise, and succeeded by Haim Ben-Shahar), and director of its Sackler Institute of Advanced Studies from 1979 to 1997. He was also the co-director (along with Sudarshan) of the Center for Particle Theory at the University of Texas, Austin from 1968 to 1990. He was a strong believer in the importance of space research and satellites to Israel's economic future and security, and thus founded the Israel Space Agency in 1983, which he chaired almost until his death. He also served on the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1965 to 1984 and held the position of scientific director in its Soreq facility. Neeman was chief scientist of the Defense Ministry from 1974 to 1976.\n\nHe was described as \"one of the most colorful figures of modern science\" and co-authored \"The Particle Hunters\", which was published in English in 1986. \"The Times Literary Supplement\" hailed this book as \"the best guide to quantum physics at present available\".\n\n\nHe was also awarded with the College de France Medal and the Officer's Cross of the French Order of Merit (Paris, 1972), the Wigner Medal (Istanbul-Austin, 1982), Birla Science Award (Hyderabad, 1998) and additional prizes and honorary doctorates from universities in Europe and USA.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Ne'eman founded Tehiya, a right-wing breakaway from Likud, formed in opposition to Menachem Begin's support for the Camp David talks that paved the way for peace with Egypt and the evacuation of Yamit. He was elected to the Knesset in the 1981 elections in which Tehiya won three seats. The party joined Begin's coalition about a year after the elections and Ne'eman was appointed Minister of Science and Development, the role later changed to Minister of Science and Technology.\n\nHe retained his seat in the 1984 elections, but Tehiya were not included in the grand coalition formed by the Alignment and Likud. After the 1988 elections, Tehiya were again excluded from the governing coalition. Ne'eman resigned from the Knesset on 31 January 1990 and was replaced by Gershon Shafat. However, Tehiya joined the government in June after the Alignment had left, and he was appointed Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Minister of Science and Technology despite not retaking his seat in the Knesset. He lost his ministerial position following the 1992 elections and did not return to politics.\n\nHe died at age 80, on 26 April 2006 in the Ichilov Hospital, Tel Aviv, from a stroke. He left a wife, Dvora; a son and daughter; and a sister, Ruth Ben-Yisrael. His death came decades after that of his adopted brother, William Friedlieb.\n\n\n"}

He was the last known holder of the 1914 Star (the Old Contemptibles), the last known combatant to participate in the 1914 World War I Christmas truce, Scotland's last known World War I veteran, and Scotland's oldest man for more than a year.\n\nAlfred Anderson was born on 25 June 1896 at 20 Kirloch Street, Dundee. He was the son of Andrew Anderson, a joiner, and Christina Thomas Emmerson. His parents married on 5 September 1888 in Chicago, Illinois, where they had two sons before returning to Scotland. The Andersons went on to have four more children, including Alfred. Andrew Anderson died on 31 July 1943, aged eighty-one, of bronchial asthmafrom which he had suffered for over twenty-five yearsand bronchopneumonia. Christina Anderson died of cardiovascular degeneration on 9 January 1953, aged eighty-four. Alfred registered both of his parents' deaths.\n\nIn October 1914, Anderson left his home and with the rest of the 1/5th Angus and Dundee Battalion of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), travelled by train from Dundee to Southampton and then crossed the channel by ferry to Le Havre. The regiment was mainly recruited in Angus, so Anderson was surrounded by a group of friends with whom he had joined the Territorial Force in 1912 at the age of sixteen; he thought that he was going on a grand adventure and as Anderson recalled in a television interview in 2005, it offered the chance of a holiday . The young lads who had joined up had volunteered to go and fight on the Western Front.\n\nOn Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (24 and 25 December) 1914, Anderson’s unit was billeted in a farmhouse away from the front line. He vividly recalled the day and once said:\n\nI remember the silence, the eerie sound of silence. Only the guards were on duty. We all went outside the farm buildings and just stood listening. And, of course, thinking of people back home. All I’d heard for two months in the trenches was the hissing, cracking and whining of bullets in flight, machinegun fire and distant German voices.\n\nBut there was a dead silence that morning, right across the land as far as you could see. We shouted ‘Merry Christmas’, even though nobody felt merry. The silence ended early in the afternoon and the killing started again. It was a short peace in a terrible war.\nBertie Felstead, who died in August 2001 at the age of 106, was originally believed to have been the last survivor of the Christmas Truce. However, it later emerged that Alfred Anderson had participated in the Christmas Truce, and he outlived Felstead by four years.\n\nThe following year the 1/5th Battalion fought at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and Loos. He became batman to his platoon commander Lieutenant Ian Bruce Gardyne MC, and also briefly to Captain Fergus Bowes-Lyon, brother to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Bowes-Lyon (1889–1915) was killed during the Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt in the Battle of Loos.\n\nWhilst Alfred Anderson was serving as a batman, he would often go out at night with Bruce-Gardyne into No-Man’s Land to listen for enemy activity such as tunneling or troop movements. On one of these night-time watches, Anderson was wounded in the back of the neck by shrapnel from shellfire in 1915. The wound, termed a ‘Blighty’ wound, meant that he was sent home to Britain to recuperate. After recovering at a hospital in Norfolk he became an infantry instructor at a camp near Ripon, rising to the rank of Staff Sergeant by the end of the war in 1918. It was during his time as an instructor that he met and married his wife, Susanna Iddison (1896–1979). After the war, he took her back to Scotland and recommenced life as a joiner in his father’s business.\n\nWhen the Second World War erupted in 1939, Alfred by now was aged forty-three and therefore too old to be drafted into the military. He was placed in command of a detachment of the Home Guard which ensured that he ‘did his bit’ for 'King and country' a second time. Following the British and Allied victory in 1945, Anderson was elected Chairman of the local branch of the Royal British Legion.\n\nHis wife died in 1979 and he moved to Alyth to be near his youngest daughter.\n\nHe was awarded the Légion d'honneur in 1998 as were all First World War veterans who fought on French soil. In 2003, when his service as batman to Fergus Bowes-Lyon (who was killed in 1915) came out, Prince Charles went to visit him. Charles is the great-nephew of Fergus Bowes-Lyon.\n\nSix weeks before his own death he moved to Mundamalla Nursing Home, where he died in November 2005 at the age of 109. At his death, he was Scotland's oldest man. He died just a few weeks after featuring in the BBC One documentary \"The Last Tommy\", which interviewed some of the last surviving First World War British Army veterans (nicknamed Tommy or Tommy Atkins).\n\nThe widower, who had five children, said he had lost count of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was actually survived by four children, ten grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren, and two great-great grandchildren. A biography (\"Alfred Anderson: A Life in Three Centuries\") was published in 2002, and a bust of him stands on display at the public library in Alyth.\n\nAbout Christmas Anderson said:\n\n\n"}

He was one of seven children in the Berger Iversen family. His eldest brother Jon immigrated to the United States in 1861, followed by his sister Mathea in 1865. In 1867, his parents and the rest of the family also followed – landing first in New York City, and then traveling to Black River Falls, Wisconsin, to join the oldest son and daughter. Simon Bergersen was 16 when he arrived in the United States. After arriving in the United States, the family had taken out naturalization papers, changed their family surname to \"Benson\" and proceeded to become United States citizens.\n\nBenson first went to work as a farm hand and later worked in logging camps and sawmills. At the age of 24, he opened a general store in Lynxville, Wisconsin. It did well until it was destroyed by fire three years later. Then 27, he was completely broke and now had a wife, Esther Searles, and son Amos to care for.\n\nHaving heard about all the timber there was in the Northwest and with his experience working in the woods and sawmills of Wisconsin, he moved his family to Portland, Oregon in 1880. Simon had two more children with Esther, Alice and Caroline, before Esther died in 1891 after a long fight with tuberculosis. In 1894 Simon married Pamelia Loomis by whom she had two more children, Gilbert and Chester.\n\nRiding through two personal cycles of prosperity and poverty before his third and lasting success, Benson went into the business of logging in near Clatskanie, Oregon and Oak Point, Washington, downstream from Portland, buying up tracts of timber wherever he could. He introduced a number of changes to Northwest logging, including the donkey steam engine which replaced the oxen that had previously been used to haul logs. He later built the famous Benson seagoing rafts which could carry up to six million board feet (14,000 m³) of timber, cutting the cost of transporting logs to markets in California.\n\nIn 1898, he moved his family and his business headquarters back to Portland. The family lived in a rented house for two years until Benson decided to build a new home at the corner of SW Park and Montgomery. This is the home known as the Simon Benson House. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, it was later saved from city condemnation and restored by the Friends of Simon Benson House and moved to the Portland State University (PSU) campus at SW Park and Montgomery in 2000. It houses a visitor's center and is home to the PSU Alumni Association.\n\nNow a wealthy man, Benson's interests expanded beyond the timber industry. In 1912, he began building a fine hotel because he felt it was needed in Portland to attract tourists and more commerce to the city. It was modeled on the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago, a brick structure with the same type of French mansard roof. It opened in 1913 and was known as the Oregon Hotel. For sixteen months it lost money and finally Benson took over management, at which time it became known as the Benson Hotel.\n\nBenson later built the Columbia Gorge Hotel near Hood River in 1921. He brought Henry Thiele, later owner of his own famous restaurants in Portland, to be its head chef. Benson was also an enthusiastic supporter of good roads and among a group of businessmen who encouraged the building of the Columbia River Highway. When citizens of Hood River County voted a $75,000 bond levy to construct the portion of the highway that would run from the Multnomah County line to Hood River, Benson purchased the entire bond issue within a month because the bonds were not selling.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Benson moved to southern California to retire, but gradually became active in business again, buying and developing land and managing business properties. He died in Los Angeles, California in August 1942. Benson is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nBenson is well remembered for his philanthropy. He has been quoted as having said: \"No one has the right to die and not leave something to the public and for the public good.\"\n\nBenson purchased a 400-acre (1.6 km²) tract of land in the Columbia River Gorge, which included Wahkeena Falls and Multnomah Falls, and deeded it to the City of Portland for a public park. Subsequently, the land was divided to become the Wahkeena Falls Recreation Area, Benson State Park, and Multnomah Falls Recreation Area. Benson also paid for the masonry footbridge across Wahkeena Falls and the reinforced concrete arch pedestrian bridge over the lower Multnomah Falls.\nIn 1905 Benson donated the Forestry Building at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland.. The building was the largest wooden building at the time and it burnt down in 1964. The interior was copied in the Glacier Park Lodge.\n\nSimon Benson was a tee-totaler and he wanted to discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day. In 1912, Benson gave the City of Portland $10,000 for the installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. These fountains, known as \"Benson Bubblers\", are still in use in downtown Portland. Today there are 52 Benson fountains, most in Portland but also one in Sapporo, Japan (since 1965), the first of Portland's sister cities; one at the Maryhill Museum of Art in the Columbia River Gorge; and since 2012 one in Pendleton, Oregon. Conservationist Francis J. Murnane was instrumental in preserving the bubblers, his first successful project.\n\nBenson was chosen to represent Oregon at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, as the state's \"First Citizen.\"\n\nIn 1916, Benson gave the Portland School District $100,000 to help fund the building of a polytechnic school. Finished in 1918, the school was first used for the training of soldiers for World War I. It was re-opened to high school students in January 1919 and renamed Benson Polytechnic.\n\nIn 1921, after moving to Beverly Hills, California, Benson deeded the city of Portland nine acres overlooking the Willamette River between North Greeley and Going Streets. The land was later dedicated as Madrona Park.\n\nThe Simon Benson Award was created in 1999 to honor the region's contemporary pioneers of philanthropy. Portland State University's Simon Benson Award honors philanthropists who have made a lasting impact in the region.\n\n\n"}

The special preparations required to do so limited their operational flexibility and required additional time and resources. Alois Lödige and several of his colleagues of the Kiel-Eckernförde torpedo testing center developed the concept of putting tracks on a midget submarine to allow it to move on and off a beach under its own power. They designed and built a proof-of-concept vehicle in early 1944 that was tested in March. The one-man (special vessel) was long and displaced without armament. It mounted a pair of torpedoes low on the hull by the tracks.\n\nThe prototype \"Seeteufel\" was developed in four months and was ready for testing in July. A two-man crew controlled the submarine. It had a beam of and displaced . The submarine was equipped with an gasoline-fueled Otto engine provided propulsion on both water (at on the surface using a single propeller) and land (at ). When submerged, the same electric motor as used in the \"Seehund\" (Seal) midget submarine, gave the vessel a cruising speed of . The prototype demonstrated a diving depth of \n\nThe \"Seeteufel\"s engine was in the bow, directly underneath the fixed snorkel mast that also contained the periscope, a radio antenna and the magnetic compass. The control room was aft of this with a low-profile conning tower fitted with the entry hatch. The batteries and the fuel tank were in the middle with the AEG electric motor in the stern. The forward diving planes were fixed, but the rudder and aft diving planes were governed by the driver with his aircraft-like control stick. The boat was equipped with a special ballast tank that compensated for the weight of its armament of a pair of standard G7e torpedoes and prevented it from breaking the surface when the torpedoes were fired. It could carry four naval mines in lieu of the torpedoes. On land it could be equipped with flamethrowers or machine guns.\n\nTesting showed that the submarine performed well underwater, but it was considered underpowered on land and the tracks were too narrow. More powerful diesel engines were planned for later models, in addition to wider tracks to spread the load and decrease ground pressure. The prototype was demonstrated to the management of the Borgward factory in Bremen and negotiations began for the production of three preproduction vessels to test the planned changes. The decision by the (Naval High Command) to focus production on models already being manufactured at the beginning of 1945 caused these plans to be canceled. The prototype was transferred to Lübeck and destroyed at the end of the war.\n\n (Vice Admiral) Hellmuth Heye, commander of the German Naval Special Forces (), stated in 1944:\n\"I consider the Sea Devil a promising weapon for use in commando raids. It is independent of mother craft and base personnel, can land on foreign shores, commit acts of sabotage, and evade pursuit ashore or afloat. It can be taken to site by a mother ship equipped with a large crane. With an engine of higher output than that of the experimental boat, a speed of 8 to 10 knots can be obtained. Speed and radius of action could be further increased by installation of a closed-cycle engine.

He is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy for his work using folic acid antagonists to combat leukemia, which led to the development of other chemotherapeutic agents against other malignancies. Farber was also active in cancer research advocacy and fundraising, most notably through his establishment of the Jimmy Fund, a foundation dedicated to pediatric research in childhood cancers. The Dana–Farber Cancer Institute is named after him.\n\nHe was born in Buffalo, New York, to Jewish parents Simon and Matilda (Goldstein) Farber. He was the third oldest of 14 children. He was the younger brother of the noted philosopher and University of Buffalo professor Marvin Farber (1901–1980).\n\nFarber graduated from University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, or SUNY Buffalo, in 1923. Farber Hall, built in 1953 on the South Campus of SUNY Buffalo, is named for him.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Jewish students were often refused admission to US medical schools, prompting him to go to Europe. As Farber was fluent in German, he undertook his first year of medical school at the Universities of Heidelberg and Freiburg in Germany. Having excelled in Germany, Farber entered Harvard Medical School as a second-year student and graduated in 1927.\n\nFarber pursued postgraduate training in pathology at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (the predecessor of Brigham and Women's Hospital) in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was mentored by Kenneth Blackfan, and was appointed to a resident pathologist post at Children's Hospital in 1929.\n\nFollowing postgraduate training, Farber became an Instructor in Pathology at Harvard Medical School in 1929. That same year, he was also appointed the first full-time pathologist to be based at Children's Hospital, where he became a close mentee and friend of pathologist Simeon Burt Wolbach. Farber was an extremely meticulous and precise scientist, and his laboratory become known for its tidiness.\n\nIn 1946, Farber was named Chairman of the Staff at the Children's Hospital, where he managed the Medical Center of Children's and envisioned an Institute for Pediatric Pathology which now exists as the Pediatric Research building. Farber was appointed Pathologist-in-Chief of the Children's Hospital in 1947 and Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School in 1948.\n\nThroughout his career, Farber published more than 270 books and research papers on pediatric pathology, autopsy, and the history of medicine. Many remain classic references today, such as his 1937 book on autopsy methods and techniques titled \"The Postmortem Examination\".\n\nFarber's research was primarily focused on diseases in children and infants. His work at Children's spanned many areas, including cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, infant hyaline membrane disease, Eastern equine encephalitis, eosinophilic granuloma, meconium ileus, and sudden infant death syndrome. As a result, Farber is now known as a founder of pediatric pathology.\n\nThrough the mid- to late-1940s, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was almost inevitably fatal and little was known about the mechanisms of the disease. Only basic forms of treatment were available, including red blood cell transfusions and antibiotics, leading to survival rates of merely weeks to months after diagnosis. Despite general pessimism in the scientific community towards efforts to cure cancer, Farber became dedicated to the battle against childhood leukemia in 1947 during his assistant professorship at Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nFarber discovered that folic acid plays a key role in the proliferation of cancer cells in leukemias. Realizing this, he attempted to use a folate antagonist, aminopterin, to block the function of folic acid in patients with leukemia in hopes of achieving remission. In 1947, Farber conducted a clinical trial on aminopterin on 16 children, 10 of which eventually achieved temporary remission. While many practicing physicians responded to these results with enthusiasm, many scientists expressed disbelief and resistance against the new drug since Farber, a young pathologist at the time, was viewed as presumptuous. However, Farber's discovery marked a breakthrough in cancer research since no drugs had previously been found effective against tumors of the bodily fluids.\n\nWhile working at Harvard Medical School on a research project funded by a grant from the American Cancer Society, he carried out both the preclinical and clinical evaluation of aminopterin (synthesized by Yellapragada Subbarow). He showed for the first time that induction of clinical and hematological remission in this disease was achievable. These findings promoted Farber as the father of the modern era of chemotherapy for neoplastic disease, having already been recognized for a decade as a founder of modern pediatric pathology.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and '60s, Farber continued to make advances in cancer research, notably the 1955 discovery that the antibiotic actinomycin D and post-operative radiation therapy could produce remission in Wilms' tumor, a pediatric cancer of the kidneys. The antibiotic, derived from \"Streptomyces parvulus\", was originally offered for free by the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company. Farber and his colleagues published their results on the efficacy of actinomycin D in 1960, and further development of treatment protocols by the National Wilms Tumor Study Group resulted in a 90% survival rate in children with Wilms' tumors by the end of the century.\n\nIn 1939, during his appointment at the Children's Hospital, Farber worked with colleague Jerome S. Harris to publish a classic description of the transposition of the great blood vessels in the heart. This work played a major role in the development and advancement of pediatric cardiac surgery.\n\nIn 1952, Farber described a lipid storage disease that was subsequently named Farber disease.\n\nFarber began raising funds for cancer research with the Variety Club of New England in 1947. Together they created the Children's Cancer Research Foundation (CCRF), which was one of the first nationwide fundraising efforts to take full advantage of modern media, such as a broadcast of the radio show \"Truth or Consequences\". On May 22, 1948, one of the CCRF's first patients to respond to Farber's antifolate, a twelve-year-old boy named Einar Gustafson, appeared on the show. Despite having Burkitt lymphoma, rather than leukemia, Gustafson (nicknamed 'Jimmy' for publicity purposes) became an inspiration for all pediatric cancer patients and triggered the renaming of the CCRF to the Jimmy Fund.\n\nThe success of the Jimmy Fund led Farber to realize the importance of marketing in the scientific advancement of knowledge about diseases. For the remainder of his career, Farber would extend far beyond his identity as a pathologist and oncologist, becoming not only a clinician but a public cancer research advocate too. This personal transition reflected the shift in society's attitude towards cancer as well; bringing cancer into the public spotlight propelled funding and awareness for cancer research for the remainder of the century and beyond.\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, and continuing until his death in 1973, Farber became a star presenter at Congressional hearings on appropriations for cancer research. A compelling speaker, he was very successful in his efforts. With Mary Woodard Lasker, a longtime advocate of biomedical research, famed surgeon Michael E. DeBakey, Senator J. Lister Hill of Alabama and Congressman John E. Fogarty of Rhode Island, Farber led the drive for a massive expansion in federal spending for cancer research. Between 1957 and 1967, the annual budget of the National Cancer Institute, the government's primary funder of cancer research, jumped from $48 million to $176 million.\n\nIn 1974, Farber's CCRF was renamed the Sidney Farber Cancer Center, and again in 1976 to the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute. Long-term financial support by industrialist Charles A. Dana and his foundation was acknowledged by the building of the Charles A. Dana Building in 1978 and the establishment of the Institute's present name of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1983.\n\nFarber married Norma Farber (formerly Holzman) in 1928, a poet, author of children's books, and classical soprano.\n\nOn March 30, 1973, at the age of 69, Sidney Farber died from cardiac arrest while working in his office. Upon his death he was survived by his widow, four children, and three grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

There are many variations on these basic types, with inter-grades between them. Bell-beakers have been found from North Africa to southern Scotland and from Portugal to the far east of Europe, but are particularly common in the Rhine valley and the coasts of the North Sea.\n\n“Typical” bell beakers appear to be the earliest type and are often covered with decoration made from impressing twisted cord into the unfired clay. When the decoration covers the whole vessel they are known as all-over corded (AOC) beakers. Where comb designs are used, perhaps along with cord impressions they are called all-over ornamented (AOO) beakers. Some have a looped handle on one side or a white coloured material pressed into the decoration, contrasting with the usual orange or brown ceramic.\n\nThe traditional archeological interpretation is that the original, typical bell-beaker shape was replaced by the short-necked form, which in turn was replaced by long-necked bell-beakers. However, work by Humphrey Case in the 1990s suggests that all three styles were used contemporaneously, with different shapes used for different purposes.\n\n"}

The GLA also make an appearance in issue #309 of \"Avengers\" and in the 1990 \"Avengers Annual\". This was followed by appearances in issues #15–17 and #25 of \"Thunderbolts\" and issues #10–11 and #61 of \"Deadpool\".\n\nIn 2005, the GLA were featured in a self-titled, four-issue mini-series (written by Dan Slott) and the one-shot, \"GLX-Mas Special\". This was followed in 2006 by a minor appearance in \"I ♥ Marvel: Masked Intentions\", \"The Thing\" vol. 2, #8, and \"Cable and Deadpool\" #30.

The Avenger Hawkeye first protests their use of the name \"Avengers\", and eventually the GLA are sent a cease-and-desist order by the Maria Stark Foundation. The team rename themselves the Lightning Rods after fellow super-team, the Thunderbolts. While working for S.H.I.E.L.D., Mr. Immortal suggests a name-change to S.W.O.R.D., although ultimately the team's name is changed to the Great Lakes X-Men when its members collectively realize that they are all mutants.\n\nAfter another cease and desist -- this time from Marvel Girl of the X-Men, the GLA rename themselves the Great Lakes Champions. Following the events of \"Avengers: Civil War\", the team operated as the Great Lakes Initiative in the state of Wisconsin. Some time later, the team reverts to the name Great Lakes Avengers.\n\nCraig Hollis discovers that he is immortal, and he decides to fight crime as Mr. Immortal. After being shot by a group of thieves and left for dead, he realizes that operating alone may not be feasible. He places an advertisement for costumed adventurers in the local paper and assembles the Great Lakes Avengers, recruiting Dinah Soar, Big Bertha, Flatman and Doorman. Mr. Immortal refuses one candidate, Gene Lorrene, a leather fetishist calling himself Leather Boy. Turned down because he has no superpowers and is therefore ineligible, Lorrene takes the rejection personally.\n\nThe team is first seen in public by Avengers Hawkeye and Mockingbird, who watch the group as they foil a robbery attempt. Although annoyed by the team's naiveté and their use of the \"Avengers\" name without permission, Hawkeye and Mockingbird agree to act as the team's mentors. The Great Lakes Avengers assist the Avengers and West Coast Avengers from time to time, and once help them fight Terminus. After aiding the Thunderbolts against the villain Graviton, the GLA clash with the mercenary Deadpool.\n\nAfter a period of inactivity, the team learns that the West Coast Avengers have been disbanded and that Hawkeye has been killed. The team subsequently battle Maelstrom, who is building a doomsday device. During this encounter, Dinah Soar is killed. New members Squirrel Girl (who has a pet squirrel Monkey Joe) and Grasshopper are then recruited. Although Maelstrom is defeated via Mr. Immortal's trickery, Doorman, Grasshopper and Monkey Joe are all killed (the last of these murdered by Gene Lorrene, who sought revenge against the GLA). Mr. Immortal is also killed several times, though he always recovers. Doorman is revived soon after his death and learns that he is connected to the Darkforce Dimension, and Mr. Immortal learns that as an immortal he is considered \"Homo sapiens supreme\". Despite defeating Maelstrom and saving the universe, the Great Lakes Avengers' victory goes unnoticed. After receiving a subpoena from the Avengers and discovering that they are all mutants, the team decides to rename themselves the Great Lakes X-Men.\n\nSquirrel Girl acquires a new partner, a female squirrel called Tippy-Toe; Grasshopper II dies after misjudging his armor's jumping capabilities and Doorman becomes an \"angel of death\" charged with conveying the souls of the dead to the afterlife. After Flatman wins a superhero poker tournament and Marvel Girl demands that they drop the \"X-Men\" name, the team assumes the name Great Lakes Champions.\n\nWith the beginning of the \"Civil War\" storyline, the GLC decide to comply with the Superhuman Registration Act, in fact waiting in line to register the day the Act is announced. The team is renamed as the Great Lakes Initiative, becoming officially sanctioned by the Fifty State Initiative as the team for the state of Wisconsin.\n\nThe team and Deadpool stop A.I.M. from using an \"inebriation ray\" that induces drunkenness in superheroes. Deadpool is granted reserve membership on the team, but is forcibly evicted from GLI headquarters after proving to be too much of an annoyance.\n\nThe team also appears during the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline confronting a Skrull disguised as Grasshopper, with help from Gravity and Catwalk. When Norman Osborn assumes control of the Initiative, he transfers Gravity to a leadership role in the GLI, much to the superhero's dismay.\n\nAfter a fight with Fin Fang Foom, Squirrel Girl elects to leave the team and return to New York, because she feels that the other team members (who simply stayed in their headquarters, playing cards, during the fight) have come to rely upon her too much, and that her continued presence will prevent them from reaching their full potential as heroes and as a team.\n\nDuring the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, the team has reverted to the name Great Lakes Avengers where they encounter Asbestos Man, who had been taking advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening. After standing around him for hours, Mr. Immortal talks him into giving up in return for being remembered by the others.\n\nIt is revealed that the team had disbanded and gone their separate ways. Flatman receives a visit from Connie Ferrari, a lawyer representing the real Avengers, who informs him that the GLA has been reinstated as a permanent addition to the Avengers. Flatman reunites with Big Bertha and Doorman, though Mr. Immortal doesn't show up and Squirrel Girl apparently ignores Flatman's call. The team moves to a new headquarters, a factory owned by Tony Stark in Detroit, Michigan. The team visits a local bar, where a fight breaks out after the owner, Nain Rogue, insults the team. Upon getting arrested after a fight, Doorman escapes, leaving Flatman and Bertha to deal with a young girl named Goodness Silva, who can transform into a werewolf, who was attacking the cops inside the station. Ferrari gets the team released over the accusations of councilman Dick Snerd, who is actually Nain Rouge. She also helps the team recruit Goodness Silva, who takes the name of Good Boy. After Snerd shuts the team down, Mr. Immortal returns and goes on patrol with Flatman, while Bertha, Doorman and Good Boy go to Nain Rogue's bar to find clues. At the bar, Bertha and Good Boy find Snerd drunk and discern his secret identity. Doorman is brought to the Darkforce Dimension where Oblivion angrily questions his absence, while Mr. Immortal and Flatman resolve their issues. Bertha and Good Boy take Nain Rogue hostage, where he reveals some of his background story.

After Ferrari tells the team to lie low for a couple of days, Bertha goes to a modeling gig for a weight-loss product created by Dr. Nob — a trap set to get a sample of her mutant DNA and use it to improve his product with Bertha's powers. Meanwhile, Good Boy's brother, Lucky, visits her at GLA HQ and tells her they need to leave town due to what she did to Nain Rogue. Bertha fights back against Dr. Nod and his squad, but Dr. Nod ingests much of the supplements, becoming a huge monster, and injures her. Bertha sends a text to the rest of the team, including Good Boy, and takes some of the supplements herself to fight Dr. Nod. During the battle, Dr. Nod takes more of the supplements, becoming much bigger and monstrous. On Mr. Immortal's suggestion, Doorman and Mr. Immortal enter Dr. Nod's body, where Mr. Immortal kills him by punching his heart.

He got his start by accepting a \"shoot\" wrestling challenge from Bob Roop. Although Roop defeated Kernodle by submission, Kernodle's skills impressed Ole Anderson and Gene Anderson who both offered to train Kernodle for free.\n\nAt first, he (now known as Pvt. Kernodle) was part of Sgt. Slaughter's \"Cobra Corps\" and teamed with Slaughter and Pvt. Jim Nelson. In 1982, the team of Kernodle and Nelson won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship from Porkchop Cash and Jay Youngblood. They later lost the title to Cash and King Parsons, from whom they also regained the title. After Nelson was removed from the alliance, Kernodle became the tag partner of Sgt. Slaughter, with whom he held the NWA World Tag Team Championship in late 1982 and early 1983. They lost the titles in a steel cage match vs. Rick Steamboat and Jay Youngblood on March 12, 1983.\n\nFollowing the title loss, Kernodle remained a villain and formed a tag team with Bob Orton, Jr. and was managed by Gary Hart. He soon turned against America and formed a tag team with Ivan Koloff and won the NWA World Tag Team Title. When Koloff's \"nephew\" Nikita Koloff arrived in late 1984, Kernodle helped to train him. Also in 1984, the Koloffs turned on Kernodle after he and Ivan lost the NWA World Tag Titles to Dusty Rhodes and Manny \"The Raging Bull\" Fernandez and started a feud. Kernodle teamed with his brother Rocky to feud with the Koloffs and helped the Rock 'n' Roll Express to win the Tag Team Title from them at Starrcade '85: The Gathering.\n\nIn 1986, Kernodle left the NWA and wrestled in various independent promotions in the Carolinas. He later became a Sergeant for Immigration Customs Enforcement for Alamance County.\n\nSince 2002, Kernodle and his brother have wrestled several times per year with CWF Mid-Atlantic near their home in Burlington, NC.\nHe is now a deputy sheriff with the Alamance County sheriffs office.\n\nHe appeared in the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie \"Paradise Alley\".\n\nIn college, he lettered four times in amateur wrestling.

It runs from US Highway 131 (US 131) at exit 61 outside of Bradley to M-43 just west of Hastings in the Lower Peninsula. The highway crosses through forest land and provides access to state recreational areas. M-179 has been given the Chief Noonday Recreational Heritage Route designation by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). Prior to October 1998, this highway was the eastern portion of county road A-42. The number was formally assigned by the next year. This is not the first time the number was used in Michigan, an unrelated M-179 previously existed in the 1930s through the 1950s farther north.\n\nM-179 begins at an interchange with US 131 just west of Bradley. From there, the road travels to the east past the Gun Lake Casino and through the community before bending around the southern edge of Sager Lake. After passing the lake, the highway resumes its easterly course and continues through the rural forest areas of eastern Allegan County, where the road is known as 129th Avenue. M-179 crosses the county line and heads into Barry County north of Gun Lake. The road is then locally known as Chief Noonday Road. Here it continues its eastward trek until it winds its way through the Yankee Springs State Recreation Area. After passing through the recreation area, the road continues to the east passing through wooded area before a slight curve to the north, after which it continues to the east and terminates at a junction with M-43 just west of Hastings.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains the roadway as a part of the state highway system. As a part of this role, the department tracks the average annual daily traffic on its roadways, a calculation of the number of vehicles to use a highway segment on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that 5,622 vehicles in Allegan County and 4,253  vehicles in Barry County used M-179 daily. For the whole length of the highway, the commercial traffic was calculated to be 246 trucks daily in 2009. No section of the highway has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. M-179 has been named the Chief Noonday Trail Recreational Heritage Route (now a Pure Michigan Byway) by MDOT for its \"natural beauty\" and access to recreational areas.\n\nThe original version of M-179 was established in 1935 as a shortcut near Le Roy between US 131 and what was M-63. That route was turned back to local control in late 1958 or 1959, and the designation disappeared from the system. (The original M-63 itself was decommissioned a few years later in 1961.) On October 1, 1998, as part of the Rationalization process, a jurisdictional transfer turned county road A-42 between US 131 and M-43 over to the state, which the state later designated as M-179 for the following year.\n\n"}

In both conflicts he was wounded. He earned the Silver Star with three oak leaf clusters, Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster and the French Croix de guerre. After World War II, he became a successful businessman and the founder of a New York City bond brokerage house, as well as a spokesman for conservative political causes.\n\nAs a child, Archie was very quiet but very mischievous – especially when he was with his brother Quentin; growing up, Archie and Quentin were very close. They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly. His father remarked to him, \"Archie, my smart boy, never give up your smartness; that goes for you and your brother Quentin.\"\n\nArchie first attended the Force School and Sidwell Friends School.\nAfter being expelled from Groton, Archie continued his education at the Evans School for Boys, and graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass., in 1913. He went on to Harvard University, where he graduated in 1917.\n\nArchie was born in Washington, D.C., the fourth child of President Theodore \"T.R.\" Roosevelt, Jr. and Edith Kermit Carow. He had three brothers, Ted (Theodore III), Kermit, and Quentin, a sister Ethel, and a half-sister Alice. Archie was named for his maternal great-great-great-grandfather Archibald Bulloch, a patriot of the American Revolution.\n\nHis first cousin was Eleanor Roosevelt and his fifth cousin, once removed was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was uncle to Kermit Roosevelt Jr., Joseph Willard Roosevelt, Dirck Roosevelt, Belle Wyatt \"Clochette\" Roosevelt, Grace Green Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt III, Cornelius V.S. Roosevelt, and Quentin Roosevelt II. His sister-in-law was Belle Wyatt Willard Roosevelt, and his grandniece was Susan Roosevelt Weld, the former wife of Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld.\n\nArchie volunteered for the United States Army during 1917, shipped over to France, and was wounded while serving with the U.S. 1st Infantry Division. His wounds were so severe he was discharged from the Army with full disability. He had ended the war as an Army captain. For his valor, Archie received two Silver Star Citations (later converted to the Silver Star medal when it was established in 1932) and the French government's Croix de Guerre. After the death of his father in 1919, he sent a telegram informing all his siblings that \"the old lion is dead\".\n\nAfter the end of the war, he worked for a time as an executive with the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company, as vice president of the Union Petroleum Company, the export auxiliary subsidiary of Sinclair Consolidated. At the same time his eldest brother Ted was Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In 1922, Albert B. Fall, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, leased, without competitive bidding, the Teapot Dome Field to Harry F. Sinclair of Sinclair Oil, and the field at Elk Hills, California, to Edward L. Doheny of Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company, both fields part of the Navy's petroleum reserves. The connection between the Roosevelt brothers could not be ignored. After Sinclair sailed for Europe to avoid testifying, G. D. Wahlberg, Sinclair's private secretary, advised Archibald Roosevelt to resign to save his reputation. Eventually, after resigning from Sinclair, Roosevelt gave key testimony to the Senate Committee on Public Lands probing the Teapot Dome scandal, in which Roosevelt was not implicated, but where Sinclair and Doheny both gave \"personal loans\" to Secretary Fall. Following this, Roosevelt took a job working for a cousin in the family investment firm, Roosevelt & Son.\n\nIn the summer of 1932, Archie, former President Calvin Coolidge, former Solicitor General William Marshall Bullitt, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and General James Harbord, among others, formed a conservative pressure group known as the National Economy League, which called for balancing the federal budget by cutting appropriations for veterans in half.\n\nIn 1942, Captain Archibald Roosevelt met with the Kurdish president, Qazi Muhammad, of the Republic of Mahabad in Mahabad, Iran, shortly before the creation of the Soviet-backed Kurdish republic. The meeting took place at the House of Qazi Muhammad in Mahabad, Iran.\n\n During 1943, following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt petitioned President Franklin D. Roosevelt to put his battlefield-honed leadership skills to worthwhile use supporting the war effort. The president approved his request and he rejoined the Army with a commission as a lieutenant colonel. Roosevelt was given command in early 1943 of the US Army's 2nd Battalion, 162nd Infantry Regiment also called the 162 Regimental Combat Team, (RCT), 41st Infantry Division in New Guinea commanding this unit until early 1944. Working with the Australian 3rd Division, Roosevelt and his battalion landed in New Guinea's Nassau Bay, on July 8, 1943.\n\nOvercoming significant command ambiguities between American and Australian forces because of overlapping spheres of operation, Roosevelt played an important role in the Salamaua campaign. His service was recognized when one of the hotly contested ridge-lines northwest of the island's Tambu Bay was named in his honor. This piece of key terrain during the campaign was originally referred to as \"Roosevelt's Ridge\" to mark the ridge nearest his battalion to higher HQ. Later, it was referred to as \"Roosevelt Ridge\" as it was depicted in the official American and Australian campaign histories as well as the US Army Air Force World War II Chronology. See left map.\n\nOn August 12, 1943, Roosevelt was wounded by an enemy grenade, which shattered the same knee that had been injured in World War I, and for which he had been earlier medically retired, earning him the distinction of being the only American to ever be classified as 100% disabled twice for the same wound incurred in two different wars. At the time of his injury, command of his battalion passed to his executive officer, Major Taylor. Archie returned to his unit in early 1944. For these actions in the Pacific Theater of Operations, Roosevelt was awarded his second and third oak leaf clusters to the Silver Star in lieu of additional awards.\n\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Archie Roosevelt formed the investment firm of Roosevelt and Cross, a brokerage house specializing in municipal bonds. It is still a going concern with offices in New York City, Providence, Buffalo and Hartford. In 1953 he joined the Empire State Society of the Sons of the American Revolution of which both his father and elder brother had been members.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Archie became affiliated with a variety of right-wing organizations and causes. He joined the John Birch Society and was the founder of the Veritas Foundation, which was dedicated to rooting out presumed socialist influences at Harvard and other major colleges and universities. Writing in the book \"America's Political Dynasties\" (Doubleday, 1966), Stephen Hess commented: \"Archie Roosevelt has, in recent years, added the family's name to many ultra-rightist causes. As a trustee of the Veritas Foundation he was a leader among those seeking to root out subversion at Harvard. He also sent a letter to every U.S. Senator, stating 'modern technical civilization does not seem to be as well-handled by the black man as by the white man in the United States.' Present civil rights difficulties he blamed on 'socialist plotters.'\" Roosevelt also edited 1968's incendiary \"Theodore Roosevelt On Race, Riots, Reds, Crime.\" He was also the chief sponsor behind \"The Alliance,\" a short-lived organization of the 1950s.\n\nIn 1954, when the Theodore Roosevelt Association made a decision to award the Theodore Roosevelt Medal for Distinguished Public Service to black diplomat Ralph Bunche, Archie loudly protested the award. He even went so far as to write and publish a 44-page pamphlet that attempted to prove Bunche had been working as an agent of the \"International Communist Conspiracy\" for more than two decades.\n\nArchie additionally served as President for an organization named The Alliance, Inc., where Zygmund Dobbs was Research Director. The Alliance published books by Dobbs such as \"Red Intrigue and Race Turmoil\" (New York: The Alliance, Inc., 1958), for which Archie wrote forewords. In the Foreword to \"The Great Deceit: Social Pseudo-Sciences\", Archie wrote: \"Socialists have infiltrated our schools, our law courts, our government, our MEDIA OF COMMUNICATIONS... the Socialist movement is made up of a relatively small number of people who have developed the TECHNIQUE OF INFLUENCING large masses of people to a VERY HIGH DEGREE.\"\n\nArchie married Grace Lockwood, daughter of Thomas Lockwood and Emmeline Stackpole, at the Emmanuel Church in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 14, 1917. The couple spent most of their married life in a pre-Revolutionary house on Turkey Lane in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, not far from Oyster Bay, where they had four children:\n\nOn October 13, 1979, Roosevelt died of a stroke at the Stuart Convalescent Home in Stuart, Florida. He was 85 years old, the last child of Theodore and Edith to die (although his half-sister Alice would outlive him by four months). He is buried with his wife at Young's Cemetery, Oyster Bay. His tombstone reads: \"The old fighting man home from the wars.\"\n\nRoosevelt's grandson is Tweed Roosevelt (b. 1942), who is the chairman of Roosevelt China Investments, and is the President of the Board of Trustees of the Theodore Roosevelt Association.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1925496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925496", "title": "Military history of Argentina", "text": "Military history of Argentina\n\nThe military history of Argentina spans a period of over two centuries. During the course of those years, it broke colonial ties with Spain, waged a civil war to define its organization and wars with Brazil, Paraguay, Britain and France. The military also played a role in the institutional life of the country, during a series of coups d'état that took place in the 20th century.\n\nOne of the first notable military conflicts taking place in modern Argentina were the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, involving both Buenos Aires and Montevideo (currently part of Uruguay). As part of the Napoleonic Wars, a British force led by William Carr Beresford occupied Buenos Aires on June 27. The French Santiago de Liniers moved to Montevideo and led the forces that would reconquer Buenos Aires on August 12, 1806. The Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte, who had fled from the city to Córdoba, was not allowed to return, and Liniers was trusted to organize the defense of the city against a possible British counter-attack. For this end he drafted all men capable to bear arms, regardless of their social condition (including slaves), and formed militias to defend the city. The Regiment of Patricians, composed of criollo people, was created during this time.\n\nThe second invasion took place the following year. A new British army, much bigger than the first one, invaded first Montevideo and then moved to Buenos Aires, led by Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke. The British found a strong resistance and were forced to surrender, and return Montevideo to the viceroyalty.\n\nAs a result of the invasions, Sobremonte was removed as viceroy, and replaced by Liniers. The Regiment of Patricians, led by Cornelio Saavedra, became a strong political force in Buenos Aires, and was instrumental to the failure of the Mutiny of Álzaga and the success of the May Revolution.\n\nThe May Revolution ousted the Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and replaced him with a junta, the Primera Junta. The viceroyalty was also renamed, removing the \"viceroyalty\" word from it, and it nominally became the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. However, the status of the different territories that used to belong to the viceroyalty changed many times during the development of the war, as some regions would remain loyal to the former organization, others were captured or recaptured, and later they would divide into several countries.\n\nThe first military campaigns against the royalists were waged by Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli. The Army of the North led by Castelli was headed first by Ortiz de Ocampo and defeated a counter-revolution organized by Liniers at Córdoba. Castelli took command to enforce the execution of the captured royalists, and then moved to the Upper Peru. He took control of it for a brief time, and was defeated by Goyeneche at the Battle of Huaqui. Belgrano led an ill-fated campaign to Paraguay, and created the Flag of Argentina when preparing the defenses of Rosario against a possible attack from the Banda Oriental (where Montevideo was under siege by Artigas). Belgrano led a new campaign to the Upper Peru, achieving military victories at Salta and Tucuman, but being defeated at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma.\n\nBy this time José de San Martín arrived to Buenos Aires with other generals of the Peninsular War. They gave new strength to the Revolutionary war, which was compromised by the defeats of Belgrano and Castelli and the royalist resistance at the Banda Oriental. Alvear took Montevideo, and San Martín started a military campaign that would span across an important part of the Spanish territories in America. First, he created the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and defeated a Spanish raid at the Battle of San Lorenzo (the only battle that San Martín fought in Argentine territory). He created the Army of the Andes in Mendoza and, with help of Bernardo O'Higgins nd other Chileans he made the Crossing of the Andes and liberated Chile. With the Chilean navy at his disposal, he moved to Peru, liberating that country as well. San Martín met Simón Bolívar at Guayaquil, and retired from action.\n\nThe Congress of Tucumán was called while San Martín was preparing the crossing of the Andes. It declared independence from Spain or any other foreign power.\n\nAfter the Argentine independence from Spain, a history of military conscription emerged and that this tradition of mandatory military service began in 1896 with the First Conscription (\"Servicio Militar Obligatorio\") where 20-year-old men were drafted by a decree of President José Evaristo Uriburu and lasted until 1994. This policy persisted owing to numerous conflicts that Argentina was involved in previously after its independence and the foreseen territorial conflicts with neighboring countries. For instance, 1825 saw the outbreak of the Argentina-Brazil War over the control of Uruguay, then called \"Banda Oriental\". This war ended with the independence of Uruguay in 1828. The Argentine military achieved several victories against Brazil but internal political strife eventually forced them to withdraw and settle for the 1828 Convention of Peace, with the British serving as the intermediary.\n\nSeveral years later, Argentina became involved in a conflict against the United Kingdom and France. This came with the November 20, 1845 Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata. The combined forces from the United Kingdom and France seized control of the Paraná River in order to establish trade relationships with Paraguayan ports blocked by Argentina. The Army of the Argentine Confederation, commanded by General Lucio Mansilla, expelled the invaders causing severe damage to the 11 warships by shooting from both river's shores, at the cost of 150 Argentines killed and 90 wounded. Although the invading troops took fewer casualties (26 killed, 86 wounded), they decided to leave in order to preserve the remaining ships. It was the last attempt on Argentine rivers by the Royal Navy. Other notable conflicts include the following:\n\n\nFrom the latter part of the 19th century to the early 20th century, the Argentine military history was characterized by a process of armed forces modernization and technification. The following are key milestones during this period:\n\n\nAfter the war, the military's role began to shift from the previous appearance as protector of the constitution and of the people against corruption. Military leaders during the postwar period began increasingly imposing their own rules and standards on the political system so that, in the end, the armed forces came to dominate the political system. This began during World War II, between 1939 and 1945. The civilian government considered joining the allies, but many officers in the armed forces and ordinary citizens objected due to fears over the spread of communism. This was a factor contributing to the military coup of 1943. Pedro Pablo Ramírez, who had been attached to the Kaiser's army and later Mussolini's in the twenties, became dictator. In 1944 he was replaced by Edelmiro Julián Farrell, who had spent two years attached to Mussolini's army. The government maintained a neutral policy but towards the end of the war, Farrell bowed to intense pressure from the United States. Like several Latin American states, Argentina made a late declaration of war against Germany.\n\n\n\n"}

He feuded with Bobby Jaggers.\n\nIn October 1985, when Mike Von Erich was unable to wrestle due to toxic shock syndrome, Vaughan went to World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) to take his place in the feud against the Fabulous Freebirds. He adopted the name Lance Von Erich and was billed as the son of Fritz Von Erich's \"brother\" Waldo. In reality, neither Vaughan nor Waldo were related to the Adkisson family.\n\nKevin Von Erich, as well as most of the family, was adamantly against bringing Vaughan in as another Von Erich, but Fritz was adamant, especially as Kevin and Kerry were wrestling two or three times a day in various places throughout the Texas territory. The deception made the von Erichs look like liars to their fans, who normally saw them as good guys who could do no wrong.\n\nOn October 28, 1985, Vaughan wrestled Ric Flair in Fort Worth, Texas, in the last NWA World title match in the World Class territory. The match ended in a no contest; World Class withdrew from the NWA in February 1986. On May 4, 1986 at The 3rd Annual Von Erich Parade of Champions he teamed with Kerry Von Erich and Steve Simpson to defeat The Fabulous Freebirds for the WCWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. On September 1, 1986, he entered in a tournament for the vacant WCWA World Tag Team Championship with Chris Adams. The team made it to the finals where they were defeated by Matt Borne and Buzz Sawyer. Lance got his revenge on November 17, 1986, when he teamed with The Dingo Warrior to capture the titles back from Borne and Sawyer. In October 1986, he wrestled a tour for New Japan Pro Wrestling, most notably his disqualification victory against Kengo Kimura on October 9.\n\nWhen demands for more money in 1987 were not met by Fritz, Vaughan jumped to a rival territory, Wild West Wrestling. In a rare breach of kayfabe, Vaughan's non-relationship to the family was exposed by Fritz on television in retaliation.\n\nBecause the Von Erich surname was a registered trademark, Vaughan wrestled under the ring name Fabulous Lance after leaving World Class. He subsequently wrestled in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council after Wild West Wrestling folded.\n\nIn May 1993, after a hiatus, Vaughan returned and was back wrestling as Lance Von Erich for promotions such as International Wrestling Federation in Florida and International World Class Championship Wrestling in New York. In December 1993, he wrestled a tour of India. In 1994, he wrestled a tour of South Africa for England's All-Star Wrestling. In 1996, he wrestled a tour of Malaysia for the National Wrestling Alliance, before retiring.\n\nPrior to becoming a wrestler, Vaughan was a real estate agent and he competed in weight-lifiting competitions.

He was known as \"Chap\" when he was young.\n\nWith riches derived from Nevada's Comstock Lode, he became one of the richest and most powerful men in California. He founded the Bank of California and was known for having a nothing-is-impossible attitude.\n\nHe built Ralston Hall in Belmont, California as a summer home, however his wife Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Fry and their four children lived there all year round. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is now part of the campus of Notre Dame de Namur University.\nHe built the California Theatre on Bush Street in San Francisco, which opened on January 18, 1869.\n\nHis dream was the construction of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California at the corner of New Montgomery and Market. He spent $5M on its construction, draining his banking empire in the process. John Painter Gaynor was the architect, and had been instructed by Ralston to study European luxury hotels for inspiration. The hotel opened on October 2, 1875. The hotel had early elevators or \"rising rooms\" and electric call buttons in the rooms. The hotel survived the 1906 earthquake, but was destroyed in the fire that followed. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1909. There is still a Ralston Room in the hotel, off the main corridor to the left.\n\nIn 1871, following a severe drought in California, he initiated work on the surveying for an irrigation scheme in the San Joaquin Valley, and his lobbying was successful in securing the passage through Congress in 1873 of an Act to set up a Water Commission to advise on the irrigation of California.\n\nHe was also involved in Philip Arnold's diamond-mining hoax of 1872.\n\nIn 1875, his financial empire collapsed as a result of the combination of the expense of building the Palace Hotel, the failure of his attempt to buy and then resell the Spring Valley Water Company, the after-effects of the Panic of 1873, and a crash in the stock value of the Bank of California. The crash occurred just weeks before the opening of the Palace Hotel.\n\nThe day after the collapse, his body was found in the San Francisco Bay. He was the victim of either a stroke during his regular swim or suicide. About 50,000 people were said to have watched his funeral procession, and 8,000 of his friends were said by Robert Brereton to have attended the public meeting held in Union Hall on September 8, 1875 to express the community's loss. His partner, U.S. Senator William Sharon, acquired many of his assets, including the Palace Hotel and Ralston Hall.\n\nRalston Avenue is one of the principal roads in Belmont, California. Ralston Street in Reno, Nevada is named for William Ralston. There are Ralston Avenue exits from both Highway 92 and Highway 101. Ralston Middle School, Ralston Hall, and the William Chapman Ralston Award are all named for him. A small mining town in southwest New Mexico was named Ralston City in honor of William Ralston, its largest investor, but has since been renamed Shakespeare. \nA very small (pop. 70) town in Iowa is named Ralston. Ralston Lane in Redondo Beach ,CA 90278. is named for William Chapman Ralston.\n\nThe town of Modesto was to be named for Ralston; he declined, however, and it was called Modesto as one of the Spanish-speaking workers at the naming ceremony for that town said he was \"\"muy modesto\"\" or very modest. Modesto is home to Ralston Tower, an 11-floor building for the elderly. It is the second-tallest building in the city.\n\nRalston was portrayed by Ronald W. Reagan in a 1965 episode of \"Death Valley Days\", \"Raid on the San Francisco Mint.\" The episode dramatizes an 1869 event in which Ralston gets the head of the mint drunk in order to persuade him to authorize an exchange of bullion for coins. Vaughn Taylor was cast as financier and adventurer Asbury Harpending.\n\nIn a 1968 \"Death Valley Days\" episode, \"The Great Diamond Mines\", narrated by Robert Taylor, the role of Ralston was played by Tod Andrews, who is deceived by two prospectors who claim to have a functioning diamond mine in the desert.\n\n"}
{"id": "1925514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925514", "title": "Space Taxi", "text": "Space Taxi\n\nSpace Taxi is an action game for the Commodore 64 written by John Kutcher and published by Muse Software in 1984. It simulates a flying taxi controlled by thrusters. The game uses sampled speech, including \"Hey taxi!,\" \"Pad one please,\" \"Thanks,\" and \"Up please.\" These are said in a variety of voice pitches, creating the feeling of different taxi customers.\n\nIn addition to thrusters, the taxi has landing gear that can be switched on or off. Switching landing gear on disables the side thrusters, but landing without landing gear destroys the taxi. The taxi also crashes when colliding with the environment, landing with high velocity or not landing properly (i.e. having only one of the gear stands on the platform while having the other in midair).\n\nThere are 24 different levels, in sequential order, and the player has to complete all of them.\n\nIn each level, there is a set of numbered platforms. At regular intervals, a customer materializes out of nowhere, on a randomly selected platform. The player has to fly their taxi to that platform, whereupon the customer will enter the taxi, saying which platform he wants to go to. When the player takes him to that platform, he will pay the taxi fee and tip based upon how fast the trip takes and the smoothness of the landing. After each numbered platform has been successfully visited, the next customer will say \"Up please\", whereupon the gate at the top of the level will open. Flying through the gate completes the level. One must also be careful not to land on or hit the customer with the taxi, not only because he will angrily yell \"HEY!\" and then disappear, before appearing somewhere else on the platform, but also deduct money from your total earned. This is increasingly difficult on smaller platforms where the platform will barely fit the customer and the taxi.\n\nEach level features a different setting or theme (such as a treat-strewn candyland or a snowy winter landscape), and most have some special feature to hinder the player's job. Some of the features include a table tennis ball bouncing across the level, snowflakes falling from the sky, a series of radar masts interfering with the controls, or teleports that send the player to a random location.\n\nThe taxi also has a limited fuel supply. The fuel level resets at the end of each level, but on some of the more complicated screens it is necessary to refuel. This is accomplished by flying to a special platform marked with an \"F\" and containing a gas pump. The player must pay for fuel out of the money he has earned. Passengers do not make allowances for pitstops, and their tip will continue to decrease as the player tanks up. The taxi's fuel consumption is based upon the time spent in the air, not how much the thrusters are used, so if a player needs to get from one side of the screen to the other, it consumes less fuel (though is more dangerous) to accelerate halfway across the screen and then reverse thrust, than to use one small thrust to move slowly across the screen and occasional upward thrusts to maintain altitude.\n\nAfter completing all levels, the player gets to a special \"mystery level\", in which the player is greeted with the message \"Welcome to... MUSEWORLD\" and three platforms, each with a figure relating to another Muse Software game: an ambulance representing \"Rescue Squad\" (1983, also John Kutcher), the soldier with Hakenkreuz for \"Castle Wolfenstein\" (1981, Silas S. Warner), and a shooting robot relating to \"RobotWar\" (1981, Silas S. Warner).\n\nKutcher wrote \"Space Taxi\" while a freshman at Hopkins University. The physics in the game were influenced by \"Lunar Lander\".\n\n\"Space Taxi\" was cloned several times for the Amiga, once keeping the original name and once as \"AirTaxi\". A similar game on the PC was called \"Ugh!\", where the player controls a caveman with a flying contraption. For Windows Phone a remake of the first eight levels was published in 2012 as \"Sketch Taxi\".\n\n\"Space Taxi 2\", an authorized sequel to \"Space Taxi\", was released by Twilight Games in 2004. It is no longer available\n\n\"Space Cab\" is a tribute to \"Space Taxi\" created for the Atmega 32u4 based Arduboy game system. \"Space Cab\" can also be played through online emulation.\n\n"}

Warner of Warner Bros., Koch wrote the screenplay for \"Mission to Moscow\" (1943). The movie subsequently spawned controversy because of its positive portrayal of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. After the war, Koch was fired by Jack Warner after Koch was denounced as a Communist. He was then criticized by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his outspoken leftist political views. Koch was blacklisted by Hollywood in 1951.\n\nAfter being blacklisted, Koch moved with his wife Anne (an accomplished writer in her own right) and their family to Europe and eventually took up residence in the United Kingdom with other blacklisted writers, where they wrote for five years for film and television (The Adventures of Robin Hood among them) under the pseudonyms \"Peter Howard\" and \"Anne Rodney\".

It is the largest store in both Sweden and Scandinavia, and the growth of the store has made \"Ullared\" more or less synonymous with \"low prices\" among Swedes. A large number of stores, usually in the lower price range, have been established in the village since the early 1990s.\n\nHistorical railway crossing\n\nTwo railways built in the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Falkenberg railway (Falkenberg–Limmared, also called Pyttebanan) and WbÄJ (Varberg–Ätran 1911–1961), had a station in Ullared, which gave it an advantage compared to surrounding villages. The railways closed around 1960. The following decade saw a lot of housing construction and the establishment of many shops and an increase in publishing services.\n\nPyttebanans hike and bicycle path\n\nPortions of the Pyttebanan is today restored as hiking and bicycle path. Signs along the path show the history of the railway. Today's track starts in Ullared running towards Fridhemsberg. At the entry of Fridhemsberg it crosses the road. Here a building still holds the old sign \"Fridhemsberg\"s station. Further the track crosses small rivers and streets. It is a well maintained track not only popular in summer.\n\nBuilding of today's municipality\n\nThe municipality merged with Källsjö and Fagered in the 1950s, during the reform by which parish sized municipalities merged to form new units. The next reform in 1971 lead to the village becoming a part of Falkenberg Municipality.\n\nThe council adopted a general plan for the village in 2005. The plan assign \"Ängaberg\" (an area behind the school) as suitable for residential buildings. Areas to the east of the village are assigned to retailing.\n\nA new road is planned between county road 154 and Gekås, in order to relieve traffic congestion on the central parts of the village. There are long term plans to change the route of county road 154.\n\n\"Apelskolan\" is a school with about 500 pupils, aged 6 to 15. The village also has a clinic, motel, fire station, care home, slalom slope and a campsite. The village obtains water from \"Ängaberg\".\n\nThe area behind Gekås' parking is today Sweden's largest all-year-round campground. There are spaces for RVs, tents as well as cabins for rent. Nearby a lake is located for swimming. Buses transfer campers to Gekås and back.\n\nGekås continuously expands and dominates the small village of Ullared. In 2016 new parking lots with multiple stories opened to meet the number of visitors. A small hill of granite has been removed to build this parking. Gekås, founded by Göran Karlsson in 1963, is considered as Scandinavia's largest shopping center.\n\nSeveral lakes surround Ullared: \"Kinnasjön\", \"Sonnerängssjön\" and \"Musasjön\". A stream, Högvadsån, and its tributary, \"Hjärtaredsån\", flows through the village. The village is surrounded by hills, and therefore requires an auxiliary transmitter in order to receive terrestrial television.\n\nThe northern part of the village, \"\"Furet\"\", is dominated by detached houses, as is the southern and western parts. The centre is dominated by retailing and there is a minor industrial estate in the southern part called \"Hedens industriområde\".\n\nUllared has a hybrid climate between maritime and continental. Since the station's inception, it has been arguably the wettest in Sweden. The inland position renders vast temperature swings a possibility under conditions favourable to those, such as summer highs above during heat waves and winter nights below . In winter, freeze-thaw cycles are common, with both rain and snow being frequent. Summer thunderstorms are rather common in the area due to the convection between various air masses.\n\nUllared is dominated by retailing, with not just Gekås, but also a large number of other retailers, of different sizes. In total, there are 1,300 workplaces, and as a result commuting is common.\n\nThe following sports clubs are located in Ullared:\n\n\n\n"}

It is composed of differing materials: the Tanezrouft contains mostly sandstone deposits, whereas the Hoggar formations are metamorphic rocks.\n\nThe Tanezrouft's sandstone hills contain steep canyon walls, some rising to 500 meters elevation. Numerous sand dunes rise from sandy stretches, interspersed with sandstone outcrops. The terrain shows stark evidence of long-ago water erosion (when the Sahara Desert's climate was much wetter; present annual rainfall is much less than 20 mm). In the present era the terrain is being shaped by wind erosion, which occurs much faster than in other areas, since there is little or no vegetation to hold the surface in place. The area is known for aridity and extreme heat, and high temperatures in summer can easily reach 52 °C (125.6 °F) or more.\n\nTanezrouft has been long-shunned by nearby civilizations (it is known as \"Land of Thirst\"). A trade route may have connected the area with Ghadames and the Hoggar, since perhaps 500 BC. It is now spanned north-south by a trans-Saharan motor route, from Béchar in Algeria to Gao in Mali. Poste Maurice Cortier is a fueling station along the route. Tanezrouft is nearly uninhabited; its few nomadic dwellers are of the Tuareg people.

As a part of Ruthenian Voivodeship remained in Poland from 1434 until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland). It was during this time that the area experienced a large influx of Polish, Jewish and Armenian settlers. In the late 14th century, Polish nobleman (szlachta), Michał Awdaniec, Abdank coat of arms became the owner of the town on 1360-s or 1370-s. On July 28, 1379, Michał Awdaniec founded a Roman Catholic parish church, and built a castle. agreed to grant Magdeburg rights to Buchach (Buczacz): it was first Magdeburg-style city, located in the Halych Land. In the early 15th century, the Awdaniec family of Buchach changed its last name into Buczacki, after its main residence. Frequent invasions of the Crimean Tatars brought destruction to the town, and in 1515, it once again received the Magdeburg rights. In 1558 Katarzyna Tworowska nee Buczacka get the king's grant for market in Buchach. In 1580, local castle was rebuilt: the castle was twice besieged by the Tatars (1665, 1667), who finally captured it in 1672, during the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–1676). Buchach was a temporary residence of Mehmed IV; here, on October 18, 1672, the Treaty of Buchach was signed between Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. According to this treaty, Poland handed the provinces of Ukraine and Podolia to Turkey. \n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Buchach belonged to the Potocki family. Mikołaj Bazyli Potocki, the Starosta of Kaniv, Bohuslav, the son of Stefan Aleksander Potocki, Voivode of Belz, who became a Greek-Catholic about 1758, built here Buchach cityhall with a 35-meter tower (near 1751), a late Baroque Roman Catholic Church of Assumption of Mary (1761–1763), and rebuilt the castle, destroyed by the Turks. With the unification of Poland and Lithuania in 1569, the newly united kingdom extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Owing to its importance as a market town, Buchach had become a prominent trading centre linking Poland and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1772, Eastern Galicia together with other areas of south-western Poland, became a part of Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria — a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as part of the First Partition of Poland. Industry came to Buchach around the end of the 19th century. Among the small-scale industries there included a brickworks, and candle and soap factory, (modern) flour mills, a textile plant, and a necktie factory. The town also boasted a brewery and a winery. The largest factory was established early in the 1900s, when the Hilfesverein concern of Vienna set up a plant for the manufacture of wooden toys in Buchach employing some 200 workers, mainly young girls. In 1912 the Stanislaviv-based Savings and Credit Union opened a branch in Buchach, and this served as a bank for local industrialists and business.\n\nBuchach remained a part of Austria and its successor states until the end of the First World War in 1918. The town was briefly a part of the independent West Ukrainian People's Republic before it was captured by the Republic of Poland in July 1919 after Ukrainian-Polish War. Also, between August 10 and September 15, 1920, it was occupied by the Red Army (see Polish-Soviet War). In the Second Polish Republic, Buchach was the seat of a county (powiat) in Tarnopol Voivodeship. In the 1920s, Buchach was inhabited by Jews (~60%), Poles (~25%), and Ukrainians (~15%). On September 18, 1939, during the Soviet Invasion of Poland, Buchach was occupied by the Red Army, and incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR (see Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact). In 1941, it was invaded by Nazi Germany. Before World War II, approximately 10,000 Jews (half of the local population) lived in Buchach. According to the Soviet Extraordinary Commission, approximately 7,000 Jews were killed in Buchach during the Nazi occupation. Some were sent to Belzec, others murdered in the streets or in killing places in the forests. A few escaped to the Soviet Union or lived in the forests and fields. In May 1943, Buchach was proclaimed Judenfrei town.\nWhen Soviets retook the town on July 21, 1944, only about 100 Jewish survivors remained. \nIn 1945, its Polish residents were resettled into the lands of western Poland that had previously been German, and Communist authorities closed the parish church, turning it into a storage facility. Bones of the members of the Potocki family, kept in the church cellar, were thrown out, and later buried at the local cemetery. \n\nIn 1965, the neighboring village of Nahirianka was annexed to Buchach. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Buchach became a part of independent Ukraine, and new, Ukrainian government returned the church to its rightful owners.\n\nThe coat of arms of Buchach originated from the Piława coat of arms, which was used by the Potocki family.\n\n\nThe city has religious communities of different churches: Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate, Adventist Church and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closest international airports are:\n\n\nBuchach is currently twinned with: \n\n\n\n"}

The term, which embraces several distinct \"tribes\" or peoples, in particular the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara groups, is pronounced with the stress on the first syllable: .\n\nThe original meaning of the word was \"human being, person\", \"human body\" in a number of eastern varieties of the Western Desert Languages (which are in the Pama–Nyungan group of languages), in particular Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara. It is now used as an Aboriginal endonym by a wide range of Western Desert Language (WDL) peoples to describe themselves. It is rarely or never applied to non-Aboriginal people. It has come to be used also as an exonym by non-Aboriginal Australians to refer to WDL-speaking groups or individuals.\n\nWith regard to the term's distribution and spelling, the following table shows the main WDL dialects in which it is used (left column) along with the word spelled according to the orthography of that dialect (right column).\n\nThe reasons for the spelling variations are that some WDL dialects do not allow vowel-initial words—in these varieties the word begins with \"y\"; some orthographies use underlining (e.g. ṉ) to indicate a retroflex consonant, while others use a digraph (e.g. \"rn\"). Pitjantjatjara seems to be the best-known source for the word, but the underlining of the consonant is often ignored (or not understood) by English speakers, and is difficult to type, so the word is very commonly, but incorrectly, rendered as \"anangu\".\n\nThe Aṉangu dwell primarily in the Central Western desert, to the south of the traditional lands of the Arrernte and Walpiri peoples.\n\nThe inma is a cultural ceremony of Aṉangu women, involving song and dance and embodying the stories and designs of the tjukurrpa (Ancestral Law, or Dreamtime). The ceremony carries camaraderie, joy, playfulness and seriousness, and may last for hours. There are many different inma, all profoundly significant to the culture.\n\nAṟa Irititja (meaning \"stories from a long time ago\") is a project of Ara Irititja Aboriginal Corporation, which works in collaboration with the South Australian Museum and Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara at Umuwa. The project began in 1994 with the aim of repatriating cultural items which had been \"lost\" over the years to Anangu of the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands. These included cultural artefacts, photographs, films and sound recordings. Some had ended up in the archives of public institutions, while others had been packed away in boxes and forgotten. By 2018, Ara Irititja had tracked down hundreds of thousands of items and made them available through interactive software, keeping them safe in a digital archive. Cultural priorities have been built into the software, and Anangu can navigate the database, add information, stories and reflections, and alert administrators to specific items requiring restricted access. This enables Anangu have control over how their history and culture are presented to the world in future.\n\nAṟa Irititja is one of ten Indigenous-owned and -governed enterprises that go to make up the APY Art Centre Collective, established in 2013.\n\n\n"}

The River Enborne shares its name, although it does not run through the village; rather, it runs through and rises near the nearby village of Enborne Row. Enborne is a civil and an ecclesiastical parish in the ceremonial and historic county of Berkshire. It lost some of its eastern land to Newbury's 20th century expansion. The village name has had many variant spellings in the past, including Anebourne in 1086, and Enbourne, Enborn, Enbourn in the last 200 years.\n\nThe parish lies immediately west of Newbury in West Berkshire, and contains the settlements of Redhill, Crockham Heath, Skinner's Green, Enborne Row and Wash Water. There is no main population centre; the settlements are scattered.\n\nThe River Enborne marks the southern boundary of the parish, where Berkshire joins Hampshire. The northern boundary is the railway line. Newbury lies to the east, and the parish of Hamstead Marshall to the west. The Kennet & Avon Canal passes across the northern end of the parish, together with the River Kennet.\n\nThe parish has always been, and still is, mostly agricultural in character, with substantial woodland and private parkland. However, in recent years, many of Enborne's former farmsteads have been redeveloped into housing.\n\nEnborne has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the east of the village, called Enborne Copse and another to the south called Avery's Pightle.\n\nEarly records show that the at one time up to at least 16 acre Reddings copse in East Enborne was held by the family of the barons de Pinkney and was granted by them to William de Clervaux or Nicholas Aufryke. By the middle of the thirteenth century De Clervaux had granted his lands in East Enborne to the Prior of Sandleford, who also acquired the lands held by Aufryke. Reddings copse belonged to one or other of these. Sandleford Priory had it until the priory's property was taken over by the Dean and Canons of Windsor of St George's Chapel in the fifteenth century. Various records of the \"sale of woods\" or \"lease of Readings Coppice\" survive which indicate tenants between 1585 and 1748. In the nineteenth century a railway in a deep cutting was built through its heart and in 1996 the by then disused railway was replaced by a wider four-lane motorway with lay-bys. \n\nEnborne is served by service 13 from Hungerford to Newbury. Enborne has never had a railway station but the now-closed Woodhay was closer than Newbury's, away today. From the 1880s to the 1960s Enborne Junction marked the forking off of the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway from the Berkshire and Hampshire Line of the Great Western Railway. The now-disused DN&SR line became much of the Newbury bypass (A34) which being a dual carriageway is wider. The large environmental protection Newbury By-pass protest against its building in the late 1990s was technically in the parish.\n\nEnborne's parish church is of 12th-century origin, dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. There is a Church of England primary school, founded in the 1820s. There is also a pub, the Craven Arms, which certainly dates back to the early 18th century and probably much earlier.\n\nOne of the Henry III rolls of Easter 1262, reads:\nThis is an early example of the name Robin Hood being used for outlaws, presumably in imitation of the famous man of legend.\n\nEnborne historically adhered to an unusual legal practice. The rights to copyhold land inheritance from a husband were forfeited if his widow remarried or was unchaste. However, the steward of the manor was obliged to reinstate the rights if she rode into the manor court, backwards on a black ram, whilst at the same time reciting a particular set of bizarre lines ending in a request for their restoration.\n\n"}
{"id": "1925562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925562", "title": "Billy Jack Haynes", "text": "Billy Jack Haynes\n\nWilliam Albert Haynes III (born July 10, 1953) is a retired American professional wrestler better known as Billy Jack Haynes.\n\nHaynes started wrestling in 1982 at the age of 28. He trained in Stu Hart's Dungeon pro wrestling school and briefly wrestled in Hart's Stampede Wrestling under his given name, forming a tag team with Bruce Hart. He started wrestling as Billy Jack in the Pacific Northwest territory but had to change his name when Tom Laughlin (who starred in the movie \"Billy Jack\") threatened to sue him. He added his real last name to the gimmick and continued to work as a babyface.\nIt is rumored that Haynes served time for manslaughter before becoming a pro wrestler.\n\nHe feuded heavily with Rip Oliver until 1984, when he had a run in Championship Wrestling from Florida where he feuded with Kendo Nagasaki for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship winning the title from him. They then had a brief run in World Class Championship Wrestling in 1985, managed by Sunshine. Due to internal conflict between Fritz Von Erich and Billy, he was written out of the organization, jobbing to Rip Oliver in a storyline where Rip bloodies and injured Billy. He rarely stayed put in any federation that he went to. During that time he faced off against the debuting Shawn Michaels. He started splitting his time between Portland Wrestling and CWF and wrestled with partner Wahoo McDaniel and won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship and in Jim Crockett Promotions where they feuded with Ole and Arn Anderson. He had just begun a feud with The Barbarian over who was the strongest man in the territory when he abruptly left the company after a confrontation with Jim Crockett in his office which became physical.\n\nIn 1986, Haynes went to the World Wrestling Federation and feuded with Randy Savage over the Intercontinental Championship and then with Hercules Hernandez over who was stronger, more muscular, and who had a better version of the full nelson (their mutual finishing maneuver). Their feud in the WWF peaked with what was dubbed \"The Battle of the Full Nelsons\" at WrestleMania III, where the two men battled to a double count-out. After the bell, Hercules' manager Bobby Heenan kneed Haynes in the back while he had Hercules in a full nelson out on the floor. Haynes chased Heenan into the ring where Hercules blindsided him with his trademark chain, hitting Haynes multiple times and (Kayfabe) cutting his forehead (in reality, Haynes had bladed himself with a small razor hidden in the tapes around his wrists after the first hit. He was actually seen on camera taking the razor out of his wrist tapes while chasing Heenan around the ring).\n\nIn the months to follow, the two had a series of \"chain matches,\" where they were attached at the wrist by a foot long chain which could also be used as a weapon during the match. Haynes later teamed with fellow Oregon native Ken Patera who had returned to the WWF. Haynes saved Patera from a beating at the hands of Hercules and Harley Race after Patera's return match. The pair would later feud with Demolition after a television match where Demolition left Haynes, Patera, and Brady Boone (who played Haynes' cousin) beaten and lying in the ring.\n\nHaynes' departure from the WWF has been a subject of controversy considering dramatic changes in the story as Haynes repeated it. In one version, he says he quit the WWF after refusing to do a job in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. Another account of the same incident reported that he actually wrestled the match with the finish reworked and then was fired afterwards.\n\nHaynes went back to Oregon in 1988 and wrestled in their independents, including forming his own promotion, Oregon Wrestling Federation. In the early 1990s he did several shows for Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation, where they built up another strongman feud between Haynes and Ken Patera. Haynes returned to the major promotions when he appeared under a mask in World Championship Wrestling as Black Blood in Kevin Sullivan's stable. Soon after The Great American Bash, he was fired in July 1991, due to a pay dispute. At the time he was fired, he suffered a severe knee injury. After a year and a half of rehabbing, he went back to Portland, where he was a heel this time and feuded with top babyface Steve Doll. He showed up next in the United States Wrestling Association in 1995 and retired in early 1996.\n\nOn March 16, 2013, Haynes was hospitalized because he was suffering from an aortic aneurysm, and liver and kidney issues.\n\nIn October 2014, the \"Portland Tribune\" reported that Haynes filed a lawsuit in federal court against WWE, alleging \"egregious mistreatment of its wrestlers for its own benefit, as well as its concealment and denial of medical research and evidence concerning traumatic brain injuries suffered by WWE wrestlers.\" This litigation was taken after research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which was attributed to causing the deaths of Chris Benoit in 2007 and Andrew Martin in 2009. Haynes also sought for the court to grant class action status for hundreds of former wrestlers and to force WWE to establish a medical trust fund to pay for wrestlers who suffer from injuries that took place in a WWE ring. Former WWE stars Vito Lograsso and Adam Mercer filed a class action lawsuit against WWE in January 2015 while being represented by the same lawyer as Haynes, Konstantine Kyros. In March 2016, the suit was dismissed by Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant. At the time of dismissal, dozens of former WWE wrestlers had joined a class action lawsuit under Kyros's counsel. On July 8, 2019, Kyros and the wrestlers (now totaling 67 wrestlers and estates of deceased wrestlers) filed their latest appeal in the class-action lawsuit known as \"Haynes, Laurinatis, et. al., v. World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., et. al.\".\n\n"}

To the northwest is the large walled plain Pavlov.\n\nMost of the interior floor of this crater has been flooded with basaltic lava, leaving a dark, low-albedo surface that is relatively level and flat. It is somewhat unusual for a crater feature on the far side to be flooded with lava, as the crust is generally thicker than on the near side.

A small crater also lies across the southern rim, while Jules Verne P is attached to the exterior along the south-southwest.\n\nJules Verne is one of the few lunar craters that is known by a person's full name rather than the surname.

{"id": "1925576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925576", "title": "Johnny Moynihan", "text": "Johnny Moynihan\n\nJohn Moynihan (born 29 October 1946, Phibsboro) is an Irish folk singer, based in Dublin. He is often credited with introducing the bouzouki into Irish music in the mid-1960s.\n\nKnown as \"The Bard of Dalymount\", he was a co-founder of the band Sweeney's Men with Andy Irvine and 'Galway Joe' Dolan (who was later replaced by Terry Woods). Sweeney's Men broke the mould of Irish music and are credited with starting the folk revival there in the late 1960s.\n\nThe most famous innovation of Sweeney's Men is probably Moynihan's introduction of the bouzouki, originally a Greek instrument, into Irish music, albeit with a different tuning: GDAD' (one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin), instead of the modern Greek tuning of CFAD'. However, the original three-course bouzouki used in early Rebetika was also tuned DAD.\n\nIn his book, \"The Humours of Planxty\", Leagues O'Toole documented that Moynihan bought his first bouzouki from a friend called Tony Ffrench, who had brought it back to Ireland from Greece but decided he couldn't play it, or didn't want to. At first, the other Sweeney's weren't too keen on Moynihan's new instrument, until the evening when he and Irvine worked out an intricate harmony for bouzouki and mandolin while rehearsing \"Rattlin' Roarin' Willy\": Later, Moynihan swapped this Greek, round back bouzouki for a pre-war Gibson mandolin. During a subsequent trip to London, he bought a flat back bouzouki from instrument maker John Bailey, who had made it as an experiment after measuring an authentic bouzouki in one of London's Greek restaurants.\n\nThe group made two albums, \"Sweeney's Men\" and \"The Tracks of Sweeney\". The latter was recorded without Irvine, who had taken himself off to the Balkans. Both albums are available on Transatlantic Records.\n\nIn 1973, Moynihan briefly joined Planxty for their album \"Cold Blow and the Rainy Night\". After Planxty, Moynihan replaced Irvine in De Dannan in 1976 and can be heard on their second album, \"Selected Jigs, Reels & Songs\", released in 1977 but never re-issued on CD.\n\nAlso in 1976, he recorded with Maddy Prior & June Tabor (the Silly Sisters) and with Tony Hall.\n\nFor a time, he also fronted the Fleadh Cowboys, a popular band in 1980s Dublin.\n\nMoynihan performs regularly at the Cobblestone Pub, Smithfield, Dublin.\n\nIn 2006, Moynihan could also often be seen playing old-time Appalachian music with a trio based in east-Clare and calling themselves 'Frankie, Johnny and Sweetheart' (a pun on the song title \"Frankie and Johnny\"). The other members were Swedish Lena Ullmann on clawhammer banjo and American Frank Hall on fiddle; in 2007, they, sensibly, renamed themselves Moonshine.\n\nMoynihan reunited with Irvine for a one-off concert in Galway in 2001. He is an erratic character, though, and it was considered doubtful if he and Irvine would ever play together again.\n\nHowever, they reunited once more, this time billed as Sweeney's Men, for a one-off gig in Rostrevor, County Down on 22 July 2007, with Paul Brady deputising for Joe Dolan who was unwell. Another Sweeney's Men reunion took place when Moynihan, Irvine and Woods performed together again on 16 and 17 June 2012, as part of Irvine's 70th birthday concerts at Vicar Street, in Dublin. It worked so well that they have resumed gigging regularly in Ireland during late 2012 and again in 2013.\n\nThe world of Moynihan and Sweeney's Men is best summed up in Andy Irvine's song \"My Heart's Tonight in Ireland\" from his \"Rain on the Roof\" album, available from Irvine's own website. More information about Moynihan and his career with Sweeney's Men and Planxty can be found in O'Toole's book.\n\nHe was famously associated with the folk singer Anne Briggs in the mid-1960s and both of them traded off their mutual inclination for wild behaviour. He plays backing bouzouki on several Anne Briggs songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Later it was paved and during the reign of Nero it was lined with colonnades.\n\nThe road provided the setting for many deeds and misdeeds of Rome's history, the solemn religious festivals, the magnificent triumphs of victorious generals, and the daily throng assembling in the Basilicas to chat, throw dice, engage in business, or secure justice. Many prostitutes lined the street as well, looking for potential customers. From the reign of Augustus, the Via Sacra played a role in the Apotheosis ceremony by which deceased Roman Emperors were formally deified. The body of the Emperor, concealed under a wax death mask, was carried on a pall from the Palatine hill down the Via Sacra into the Forum, where funeral orations were held before the procession of Knights and Senators resumed its course to the Campus Martius.\n\nWhile the western stretch of the Via Sacra which runs through the Forum follows the original ancient route of the road, the eastern stretch between the end of the forum and the Colosseum, which passes underneath the Arch of Titus, is a redirection of the road built after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. In the Republic and Early Empire, the route forked to the north near the House of the Vestals and passed through a saddle in the Velian Hill, now occupied largely by the Basilica of Maxentius and the modern Via dei Fori Imperiali. As part of his rebuilding program following the fire, Nero essentially straightened the road by redirecting it between the Velian and Palatine Hills, creating grand colonnades on either side for shop stalls and commerce.\n\n"}

{"id": "1925602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925602", "title": "Buy and hold", "text": "Buy and hold\n\nBuy and hold, also called position trading, is an investment strategy \nwhere an investor buys stocks and holds them for a long time, with the goal that stocks will gradually increase in value over a long period of time.\n\nThis is based on the view that in the long run financial markets give a good rate of return even while taking into account a degree of volatility. Buy-and-hold says that investors will never see such returns if they bail out after a decline. This viewpoint holds that market timing (i.e. the concept that one can enter the market on the lows and sell on the highs), does not work; attempting such timing gives negative results, at least for small or unsophisticated investors, so it is better for them to simply \"buy and hold\".\n\nPassive management is most common on the equity market, where index funds track a stock market index, but it is becoming more common in other investment types, including bonds, commodities and hedge funds. Today, there is a plethora of market indices in the world, and thousands of different index funds tracking many of them.\n\nPassive management is an investment strategy that is primarily used by the two firms with the largest amounts of money under management, Barclays Global Investors and State Street Corp.\n\nThe antithesis of buy-and-hold is the concept of day trading, in which money can be made in the short term if an individual tries to short on the peaks, and buy on the lows with greater money coming with greater volatility.\n\nOne argument for the strategy is the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH): If every security is fairly valued at all times, then there is really no point to trade. Some take the buy-and-hold strategy to an extreme, advocating that you should never sell a security unless you need the money. \n\nOthers have advocated buy-and-hold on purely cost-based grounds, without resort to the EMH. Costs such as brokerage and bid/offer spread are incurred on all transactions, and buy-and-hold involves the fewest transactions for a given amount invested in the market, all other things being equal. Taxation law also has some effect; tax for long-term capital gains may be lower, and tax may be due only when the asset is sold (or never if the person dies). Warren Buffett is an example of a buy-and-hold advocate who has rejected the EMH in his writings, and has built his fortune by investing in companies at times when they were undervalued.\n\nThe strategy was less popular in early 2009.\n\nFor a single event firm T-month BHAR is defined as: \n\nformula_1\n\nwhere:\n\nBHAR - the buy-and-hold abnormal return for rm i in the period between months t and T\n\nR - the return of the rm i in month t\n\nR - the return on the matched (benchmark) portfolio in month t \n\nIn order to test the statistical significance of the results (1) the average BHAR (ABHAR) needs to be calculated and (2) t-test needs to be applied. The formulations are as follows:\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nwhere:\n\nABHAR - average BHAR\n\nw - value weight based on the market capitalization of the event firms \n\nn - the number of observations \n\nσ - the variance of BHAR \n\nA buy and hold strategy can also apply to real estate. According to this concept, a person will buy a property, such as a house, and not sell it. This is typically done with borrowed money, although part of the plan is that the loan will eventually be paid off, and it is then not a leveraged investment. It contrasts with a trading strategy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925608", "title": "Michalovce", "text": "Michalovce\n\nMichalovce (; , , Romani: \"Mihalya\", Yiddish: \"Mikhaylovets\" or \"Mykhaylovyts\"; ) is a town on the Laborec river in eastern Slovakia. Originally named after the Archangel St Michael, it is the second-largest city in the Košice Region and the seat of the Michalovce District.\n\nThe city is located on the shore of Lake Sirava, approximately east of the capital Bratislava and immediately adjacent to the border with Ukraine. Michalovce is mostly recognized for its adjacent lakes and volcanic mountains, which generates tourism, and for agriculture as well as the passing Druzhba pipeline. According to the latest census, the population of the town stood at 40,255, with a metropolitan population of 109,121, which ranks it among the largest population centers in eastern Slovakia.\n\nThe city of present-day Michalovce along with the adjacent lowlands was settled in from the Palaeolithic era. Archaeologists have found prehistoric \"Homo sapiens\" skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges by the foot of the Vihorlat mountains, dating from the Neolithic. During the Late Bronze Age, which meant the period of processing bronze as the main metal, the surrounding area was an important cultural and trading center within the Carpathian Basin and, together with the area of the southern Tisa River Basin, played an important part forging relations with areas outside of the Carpathians. The history of Michalovce was significantly influenced by presence of Celtic tribes, starting from the Gallic expansions in the 4th century BC, and later by the Romans.\n\nSlovak historians claim that Slavs arrived in the area in the fifth century, first being a part of the empire of the Avars. Although there is no evidence, Slovak historians claim that the area was part of the Great Moravian empire in the ninth century. It is probably unlikely. The town of Michalovce is the place where the legendary Prince Laborec died and was buried according to legends. From the tenth century onwards, the region was part of Hungary. However when the Magyar tribes arrived in the late 800s, the entire region was sparsely populated and there were few actual settlements. Much of Slovak history is based on conjecture, legends and nationalism.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest in south central Hungary in the sixteenth century, Hungary was divided, and present-day Michalovce became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, and later Royal Hungary. The town grew significantly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Since the Austrian-Hungarian Ausgleich of 1867, it achieved the status of a large community, and shortly afterward became the seat of one of the districts of Zemplén County.\n\nThe 19th century brought back significant development of the town. In 1828 there were 49 craftsman workshops representing all 22 kinds of craft production of the crafts licences in the region of Zemplin. Until 1874 there were a few industrial factories of local importance in the surroundings of Michalovce (starch factories, distilleries, mill-houses, brickworks) with a limited number of work opportunities. The construction of the railway linking Michalovce with Medzilaborce in 1874, as well as the construction of the first railway linking Hungary with Galicia in 1871, had a profound impact on the production, business, and regional development in and around Michalovce.\n\nMore food-processing factories and industrial factories – a brewery, two brickworks and a steam millhouse – were established. Starting in 1876 doctors were employed in the town, as the Štefan Kukura Hospital was established that year. In 1896 the Hungarian language newspaper \"Felso Zemplén\" was published. In 1805 a common school is founded, which later changed into a state school. In 1804 a post office was established, and in 1873 a printing office was established.\n\nIn 1885, by a decision of the municipal council, a fire brigade was founded, and the first public lighting was provided. Unemployment, being a widespread side-effect of the 18th century, resulted in the emigration of mainly farmers. Many left to seek work in the coal mining industry in Pennsylvania, United States, giving rise to a large Rusyn American community there.\n\nAfter World War I, in 1918 (confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), Michalovce, along with some other parts of Zemplén County, became part of the then-formed Czechoslovakia. In 1944, 3500 Jewish inhabitants were deported from Michalovce. Since 1993, with the breakup of Czechoslovakia, Michalovce has been part of Slovakia. In 1996 it was made the seat of the Michalovce District.\n\nThe previous agricultural character of Michalovce was changed by a number of newly established industrial factories after 1945. In the 1950s and 1960s, factories processing agricultural products, and textile, engineering and construction companies arose. These included Agricultural Business and Supply Company, East-Slovak Dairy, East-Slovak Bakery and Confectionery, Slovak Malt Plant, East-Slovak Poultry Plant, Clothing Company and Odeta, a production company. During the early 1960s, construction of the Druzhba pipeline was a major source of employment.\n\nThe town lies in the Košice Region, in the Eastern Slovak Lowland on the Laborec river, historically belonging to Zemplén County. The town is about east of Košice and west of Uzhhorod, Ukraine. Geographical features nearby include the Vihorlat Mountains and the Zemplínska šírava lake. Nearby is the biggest lake of the Vihorlat Mountains, Morské oko, Vinné castle and Vinné lake.\n\nIn 1910, Michalovce had 6120 residents, of whom 3792 were Hungarian, 1586 Slovak and 542 German. The religious makeup was 38.6% Roman Catholic, 32.3% Jewish and 23.2% Greek Catholic. After World War II, due to the Presidential Benes decrees, almost the entire population of the region's ethnic Hungarians and Germans (including the region's native Carpathian Germans) were forcibly expelled. Those remaining were assimilated and subjected to Slovakization.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, the town had 39,948 inhabitants. 94.57% were Slovaks, 2.24% were Roma, 0.73% were Czechs and 0.47% were Ukrainian. The religious makeup was 53.92% Roman Catholics, 19.65% Greek Catholics, 9.73% people with no religious affiliation and 5.19% Orthodox.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the town had 40,027 inhabitants. 79.53% of the inhabitants were Slovaks, 3.09% were Roma, 0.39% were Czechs and 0.36% were Ukrainians. 15.47% did not specify a nationality. The religious makeup was 42.07% Roman Catholics, 16.50% Greek Catholics, 3.96% Orthodox, 3.97% Evangelicals, 10.33% with no religious affiliation and 18.30% who did not specify affiliation.\n\nThe city of Michalovce is home to many secondary schools and some university colleges. Of the seven secondary schools, the most well-known and prestigious is the Pavol Horov Gymnasium. The other gymnasium is Gymnazium na ulici Ľudovita Štúra 26.\n\nThe largest health care provider in the municipality is the Štefan Kukura Hospital in Michalovce, with 712 beds.\n\nMichalovce is twinned with:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925614", "title": "Investment strategy", "text": "Investment strategy\n\nIn finance, an investment strategy is a set of rules, behaviors or procedures, designed to guide an investor's selection of an investment portfolio. Individuals have different profit objectives, and their individual skills make different tactics and strategies appropriate. Some choices involve a tradeoff between risk and return. Most investors fall somewhere in between, accepting some risk for the expectation of higher returns.\n\nNo strategy: Investors who don't have a strategy have been called Sheep. Arbitrary choices modeled on throwing darts at a page (referencing earlier decades when stock prices were listed daily in the newspapers) have been called Blind Folded Monkeys Throwing Darts [no source]. This famous test had debatable outcomes.\n\nActive vs Passive: Passive strategies like buy and hold and passive indexing are often used to minimize transaction costs. Passive investors don't believe it is possible to time the market. Active strategies such as momentum trading are an attempt to outperform benchmark indexes. Active investors believe they have the better than average skills.\n\nMomentum Trading: One strategy is to select investments based on their recent past performance. Stocks that had higher returns for the recent 3 to 12 months tend to continue to perform better for the next few months compared to the stocks that had lower returns for the recent 3 to 12 months. There is evidence both for and against this strategy.\n\nBuy and Hold: This strategy involves buying company shares or funds and holding them for a long period. It is a long term investment strategy, based on the concept that in the long run equity markets give a good rate of return despite periods of volatility or decline. This viewpoint also holds that market timing, that one can enter the market on the lows and sell on the highs, does not work for small investors, so it is better to simply buy and hold.\n\nLong Short Strategy: A long short strategy consists of selecting a universe of equities and ranking them according to a combined alpha factor. Given the rankings we long the top percentile and short the bottom percentile of securities once every re-balancing period.\n\nIndexing: Indexing is where an investor buys a small proportion of all the shares in a market index such as the S&P 500, or more likely, an index mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This can be either a passive strategy if held for long periods, or an active strategy if the index is used to enter and exit the market quickly.\n\nPairs Trading: Pairs trade is a trading strategy that consists of identifying similar pairs of stocks and taking a linear combination of their price so that the result is a stationary time-series. We can then compute Altman_Z-score for the stationary signal and trade on the spread assuming mean reversion: short the top asset and long the bottom asset.\n\nValue vs Growth: Value investing strategy looks at the intrinsic value of a company and value investors seek stocks of companies that they believed are undervalued. Growth investment strategy looks at the growth potential of a company and when a company that has expected earning growth that is higher than companies in the same industry or the market as a whole, it will attract the growth investors who are seeking to maximize their capital gain.\n\nDividend growth investing: This strategy involves investing in company shares according to the future dividends forecast to be paid. Companies that pay consistent and predictable dividends tend to have less volatile share prices. Well-established dividend-paying companies will aim to increase their dividend payment each year, and those who make an increase for 25 consecutive years are referred to as a dividend aristocrat. Investors who reinvest the dividends are able to benefit from compounding of their investment over the longer term, whether directly invested or through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP).\n\nDollar cost averaging: The dollar cost averaging strategy is aimed at reducing the risk of incurring substantial losses resulted when the entire principal sum is invested just before the market falls.\n\nContrarian investment: A contrarian investment strategy consists of selecting good companies in time of down market and buying a lot of shares of that company in order to make a long-term profit. In time of economic decline, there are many opportunities to buy good shares at reasonable prices. But, what makes a company good for shareholders? A good company is one that focuses on the long term value, the quality of what it offers or the share price. This company must have a durable competitive advantage, which means that it has a market position or branding which either prevents easy access by competitors or controls a scarce raw material source. Some examples of companies that response to these criteria are in the field of insurance, soft drinks, shoes, chocolates, home building, furniture and many more. We can see that there is nothing “fancy” or special about these fields of investment: they are commonly used by each and every one of us. Many variables must be taken into consideration when making the final decision for the choice of the company. Some of them are:\n\nSmaller companies: Historically medium-sized companies have outperformed large cap companies on the Stock market. Smaller companies again have had even higher returns. The very best returns by market cap size historically are from micro-cap companies. Investors using this strategy buy companies based on their small market cap size on the stock exchange. One of the greatest investors Warren Buffett made money in small companies early in his career combining it with value investing. He bought small companies with low P/E ratios and high assets to market cap.\n\n\n\n"}

Mordechai \"Motta\" Gur (, May 6, 1930 – July 16, 1995) was an Israeli politician and the 10th Chief of Staff of the IDF. During the Six-Day War (1967), he commanded the brigade that penetrated the Old City of Jerusalem and broadcast the famous words, \"The Temple Mount is in our hands!\" (, \"Har HaBayit BeYadeinu\"). As Chief of Staff, he had responsibility for planning and executing Operation Entebbe (1976) to free Jewish hostages in Uganda. He later entered the Knesset and held various ministerial portfolios. He contracted terminal cancer and committed suicide at the age of 65.\n\nGur was born in Jerusalem and later joined the Palmach Haganah (the underground armed group of the Jews in the British Mandate of Palestine). He continued serving in a military capacity with the founding of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the Israeli War of Independence in 1948.\n\nIn the IDF, Gur served in the Paratroopers Brigade most of his career and became one of the symbols of the \"red beret\" brigade. During the 1950s he was a company commander under the command of Ariel Sharon. He was wounded during a counter-terror raid in Khan Yunis in 1955 (Operation Elkayam) and received a recommendation of honor from Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan. In 1957 he was appointed as adjutant to the brigade commander. After serving in this position Gur went to study at the École Supérieure de Guerre in Paris.\n\nAfter two years in France, he returned and was appointed as the commander of the Golani Brigade (1961–1963) and commanded the counter-terror raid in Nukiev. He brought over the traditions and attitude of the Paratroopers, raised morale, and helped instill an espirit de corps in Golani for which the brigade is still famous. In 1965 he was appointed as the head of the operations branch in the general staff of the IDF. He later also served as a commander of the IDF commanders' school.\n\nIn 1966 Gur was appointed as the commander of the 55th Paratroopers Brigade (Reserve), which he led during the Six-Day War. Gur and his troops were part of the assault force which wrested Jerusalem from the Jordanians, and which were the first to visit the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. The pictures of paratroopers crying at the Wall and Gur's audio recording in the communication networks, \"The Temple Mount is in our hands!\" (, \"Har HaBayit BeYadeinu!\"), became one of the most touching symbols of the war both to the Israeli public and those abroad.\n\nAfter the war he was promoted to Brigadier General's rank and was appointed as the IDF commander in the Gaza Strip and northern Sinai Peninsula. In 1969 he was promoted to Major General and was appointed as the commander of the northern front, where Palestinian terrorists from the PLO, backed by Syria, attacked Israel's northern settlements. Gur led several counter-attacks to reign in the terror attacks, conquering the Shebaa farms from Syria in order to establish a defensive position to prevent border attacks.\n\nFrom August 1972 to December 1973 he served as the IDF military attache at Israel's Washington D.C., embassy. In January 1974 he was reappointed as the commander of the northern front.\n\nFollowing the retirement of General David Elazar due to the criticism of the Agranat Commission he was appointed in April 1974 as the 10th IDF Chief of Staff. He served in that position until 1978.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the IDF, Gur was appointed as the general manager of Kur Mechanica company. In 1981 he was elected to the Knesset as a member of the Israeli Labor Party within the Alignment . Re-elected in 1984, he served as Minister of Health and was also a member of the Knesset's Security and Foreign Affairs Committee. Between 1986 and 1988 he served on the board of Solel Boneh, a construction company.

{"id": "1925618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925618", "title": "Olive oil extraction", "text": "Olive oil extraction\n\nOlive oil extraction is the process of extracting the oil present in olive drupes, known as olive oil. Olive oil is produced in the mesocarp cells, and stored in a particular type of vacuole called a lipo vacuole, i.e., every cell contains a tiny olive oil droplet. Olive oil extraction is the process of separating the oil from the other fruit contents (vegetative extract liquid and solid material). It is possible to attain this separation by physical means alone, i.e., oil and water do not mix, so they are relatively easy to separate. This contrasts with other oils that are extracted with chemical solvents, generally hexane. The first operation when extracting olive oil is washing the olives, to reduce the presence of contaminants, especially soil which can create a particular flavor effect called \"soil taste\".\n\nPeople have used olive presses since Greeks first began pressing olives over 5,000 years ago. Roman olive presses survive to the present time, with a notable collection present at Volubilis in Morocco. An olive press works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard decantation.\n\nThis basic method is still widely used today, and it is still a valid way of producing high quality olive oil if adequate precautions are taken.\n\nFirst the olives are ground into an olive paste using large millstones at an oil mill. The olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30–40 minutes. This has three objectives:\n\nOlive oil mills very rarely use a modern crushing method with a traditional press.\n\nAfter grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other, then placed into the press. Traditionally the disks were made of hemp or coconut fiber, but in modern times they are made of synthetic fibers which are easier to clean and maintain.\n\nThese disks are then put on a hydraulic piston, forming a pile. Pressure is applied on the disks, thus compacting the solid phase of the olive paste and percolating the liquid phases (oil and vegetation water). The applied hydraulic pressure can go to 400 atm. To facilitate separation of the liquid phases, water is run down the sides of the disks to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated either by a standard process of decantation or by means of a faster vertical centrifuge.\n\nThe traditional method is a valid form of producing high-quality olive oil, if after each extraction the disks are properly cleaned from the remains of paste; if not the leftover paste will begin to ferment, thereby producing inconsistencies of flavors (called defects) that will contaminate the subsequently produced olive oil. A similar problem can affect the grindstones that, in order to assure perfect quality, also require cleaning after each usage.\n\nProper cleaning produces higher-quality oil. Grindstones, while ancient in design, are a suitable way to grind olives, because this method breaks up the drupe's pulp while only slightly touching the nut and the skin. This reduces the release of the oil oxidation enzymes present in these organs. In addition, in this extraction method, the introduction of water is minimal when compared to the modern one, thus reducing the washing-off of the polyphenols. The exhausted paste, called pomace, has a low content of water, making it an easier residue to manage.\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe modern method of olive oil extraction uses an industrial decanter to separate all the phases by centrifugation. In this method the olives are crushed to a fine paste. This can be done by a hammer crusher, disc crusher, depitting machine or knife crusher. This paste is then malaxed for 30 to 60 minutes in order to allow the small olive droplets to agglomerate. The aromas are created in these two steps through the action of fruit enzymes.\n\nAfterwards the paste is pumped into an industrial decanter where the phases will be separated. Water is added to facilitate the extraction process with the paste.\n\nThe decanter is a large capacity horizontal centrifuge rotating approximately 3,000 rpm, the high centrifugal force created allows the phases to be readily separated according to their different densities (solids > vegetation water > oil). Inside the decanter's rotating conical drum there is a coil that rotates more slowly, pushing the solid materials out of the system.\n\nThe separated oil and vegetation water are then rerun through a vertical centrifuge, working around 6,000 rpm that will separate the small quantity of vegetation water still contained in oil and vice versa.\n\nWith the three phases oil decanter, a portion of the oil polyphenols is washed out due to the higher quantity of added water (when compared to the traditional method), producing a larger quantity of vegetation water that needs to be processed.\n\nThe two phases oil decanter was created as an attempt to solve these problems. Sacrificing part of its extraction capability, it uses less added water thus reducing the phenol washing. The olive paste is separated into two phases: oil and wet pomace. This type of decanter, instead of having three exits (oil, water, and solids), has only two. The water is expelled by the decanter coil together with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace that is much harder to process industrially. Many pomace oil extraction facilities refuse to work with these materials because the energy costs of drying the pomace for the hexane oil extraction often make the extraction process sub-economical. In practice, then, the two phases decanter solves the phenol washing problem but increases the residue management problem. This residue management problem has been reduced by the collection of this wetter pomace and being transported to specialized facilities called extractors which heat the pomace between 45 °C and 50 °C and can extract up to a further 2 litres per 100 kilos of pomace using adapted two-phase decanters.\n\nThe two-and-a-half-phase oil decanter is a compromise between the two previous types of decanters. It separates the olive paste into the standard three phases, but has a smaller need for added water and also a smaller vegetation water output. Therefore, the water content of the obtained pomace comes very close to that of the standard three-phase decanter, and the vegetation water output is relatively small, minimizing the residue management issues.\n\nDepending on the olives and processing, the Decanter or Tricanter can extract between 85 and 90% of the olive oil in the 1st extraction. The yield from olive oil manufacture can be increased even further with a 2nd extraction. The olive oil yield increases to as much as 96% by combining the 1st and 2nd extractions. \n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe Sinolea method to extract oil from the olives was introduced in 1972; in this process, rows of metal discs or plates are dipped into the paste; the oil preferentially wets and sticks to the metal and is removed with scrapers in a continuous process. It is based on the different surface tension of the vegetation water and the oil, these different physical behaviors allow the olive oil to adhere to a steel plaque while the other two phases remain behind.\n\nSinolea works by continuously introducing several hundreds of steel plaques into the paste thus extracting the olive oil. This process is not completely efficient leaving a large quantity of oil still in the paste, so the remaining paste has to be processed by the standard modern method (industrial decanter).\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nMany oils are marketed as first cold pressed or cold extraction. \"Cold\" means no heat is added during extraction. \"Pressed\" means that the olives are crushed in a mill to extract the oil.\n\nIn the EU, these designations are regulated by Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 of 13 June 2002 on marketing standards for olive oil. This article states that in order to use these designations the olive oil bottler must prove that the temperature of malaxation and extraction was under 27 °C (80 °F).\n\nFor olive oil bottled outside EU countries, this regulation does not apply, and thus the consumer has no assurance that these statements are true.\n\nThe temperature of malaxation and extraction is crucial due to its effect on olive oil quality. When high temperatures are applied, the more volatile aromas are lost and the rate of oil oxidation is increased, producing therefore lower quality oils. In addition, the chemical content of the polyphenols, antioxidants, and vitamins present in the oil is reduced by higher temperatures. The temperature is adjusted basically by controlling the temperature of the water added during these two steps. High temperatures are used to increase the yield of olive oil obtained from the paste.\n\nSome producers, in order to maximise product quality, choose to combine the traditional grinding method, the stone mill, with a modern decanter. This technique produces more selective grinding of the olives, reduces the malaxation time olive paste, and avoids the complicated cleaning of the olive press fibre disks. Because the use of the stone mill requires a loading and unloading phase, this extraction method is discontinuous, i.e., there are times when all the machinery is stopped, therefore it is generally not used on a large commercial scale, being applied only by small scale olive mills producing high quality olive oil.\n\nHigh quality olive oil can be obtained by all the methods if proper measures are taken. Olive oil quality is equally dependent on the quality of the olives themselves and on the time they have to wait from harvesting to extraction, in addition to the extraction method itself.\n\nThe two main agents that cause the degradation of olive oil are oxygen and light. Once an olive is harvested, it should be pressed within 24 hours. Oxidation begins immediately upon harvesting. In the period between harvest and grinding, the fruits' enzymes are very active and increasingly degrade the endogenous oil, and therefore oil obtained after a longer wait is of lower quality, presenting higher acidity (free fatty acids percentage).\n\nIn addition, if additional oxygen is allowed to interact with the olive paste during the extraction process, the acidity level will increase further. Sealed extraction methods are best to prevent the continued introduction of oxygen, as well as light to the oil.\n\nAfter extraction is complete, in most cases unfiltered olive oil appears somewhat cloudy, mainly due to the presence of minute amounts of water and suspended solids of olive pulp and seed. This type of oil is therefore sometimes called \"cloudy\" or \"veiled olive oil\".\n\nIt is common practice that unfiltered olive oils are then \"racked\" for a time, i.e. stored in cool stainless steel silos with a conical bottom that are pumped free of oxygen to enable the precipitation and separation of the two phases and facilitate later filtration; it will also contribute in the integrity and stability of the oil.\n\nThe future of olive extraction points to reducing the negative aspects of the present methods, decreasing the degradation oil produced by the extraction process in itself.\n\n\n\n"}

New Echota is located in present-day Gordon County, in northwest Georgia, 3.68 miles north of Calhoun, and south of Resaca. The site has been preserved as a state park and a historic site, and it was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1973.\n\nThe site is at the confluence of the Coosawattee and Conasauga rivers, which join to form the Oostanaula River, a tributary of the Coosa River. It is near Town Creek. Archeological evidence has shown that the site of New Echota had been occupied by ancient indigenous cultures for thousands of years prior to the Cherokee Native Americans. It was known as \"Gansagiyi\" or \"Gansagi\"; the Cherokee renamed it as New Echota in 1825 after making it the capital, in honor of their former chief town.\n\nPrior to relocating to Gansagi and building the community of New Echota, the Cherokee had used the nearby town of \"Ustanali\" on the Coosawattee River as the seat of their tribe, beginning in 1788 after migrating south from Tennessee and South Carolina under pressure from European-American settlement. \n\nUstanali had been established in 1777 by refugees from the Cherokee Lower Towns in northwestern South Carolina. In that year, Old Tassel and several other Cherokee leaders were murdered by whites while under the flag of truce, while visiting representatives of the short-lived State of Franklin. In response, warriors across the frontier increased attacks on European-American settlers. The Chickamauga Cherokee, a band led by Dragging Canoe, were already carrying out armed resistance to European-American settlement. \n\nFollowing the murders, Little Turkey was elected chief of the Cherokee, although they did not have a centralized form of government. The people moved the seat of the Cherokee council from \"Chota\" to Ustanali.\n\nNew Echota was named after Chota, the former capital of the Overhill Cherokee, those who lived to the west of the Appalachian Mountains and were associated with the region of the Overhill Towns.\n\nA common English name for New Echota was \"Newtown\" or \"New Town.\" These names are still used for the area around the State Park. Later Anglo-American settlers called the area \"The Fork\" and \"Fork Ferry\" because of transportation at the confluence of the rivers.\n\nBy 1819 the government of the Cherokee Nation was meeting in New Echota. On November 12, 1825, New Echota was officially designated as the capital of the Cherokee Nation. They had organized a council, and supreme court to adjudicate their justice issues. The tribal council began a building program that included construction of a two-story Council House, and a Supreme Court.\n\nLater they built the office (printer shop) for the \"Cherokee Phoenix,\" the first Indian-language and Cherokee newspaper. Elias Boudinot was the chief writer and editor. Samuel Worcester, a missionary and printer, laid out the first Native American newspaper. Boudinot wrote it in both English and Cherokee, using for the latter the new syllabary created in 1820 by \"Sequoyah\", with type cast by Worcester. Private homes, stores, a ferry, and mission station were built in the outlying area of New Echota.\n\nThe town was quiet most of the year, but Cherokee Council meetings provided the opportunity for great social gatherings. During these meetings, the town filled with several hundred Cherokee, who arrived by foot, horseback, or in stylish carriages.\nIn 1832, after Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act, Georgia included Cherokee territory in its Sixth Land Lottery, allocating Cherokee land to white settlers. The Cherokee Nation had never ceded the land to the state. Over the next six years, the Georgia Guard operated against the Cherokee, evicting them from their properties. By 1834, New Echota was becoming a ghost town. Council meetings were moved to Red Clay, Cherokee Nation (now Tennessee). The United States urged the Cherokee to remove to Indian Territory, offering lands in exchange for their lands in Georgia.\n\nOn December 29, 1835, a small group of Cherokee (100–500 Cherokee known as Ridgeites or the Treaty Party, who represented a minority of Cherokee) signed the Treaty of New Echota in the home of Elias Boudinot. Signers included Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Andrew Ross, a brother of John Ross, the principal chief. Believing that the negotiation would allow them to preserve some rights for the Cherokee, they agreed to cede their remaining lands and to removal in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee were to have sovereignty in that western territory. Despite objections from John Ross, who represented the large majority of Cherokee to the US government, the Senate ratified the treaty. The US government eventually forced most of the Cherokee out of the Southeast. \n\nIn 1838 the U.S. Army, under the command of Winfield Scott, began the forced removal of Cherokee from the state of Georgia. A Cherokee removal fort was located at New Echota, called Fort Wool. This held Cherokee from Gordon and Pickens counties until their removal. As the first group of Cherokee began their exodus to Rattlesnake Springs, Cherokee Nation (4 miles south of Charleston, Tennessee), the Cherokee from counties south and east of the area also were housed here.\n\nAfter the Cherokee were fully removed in 1838, their capital remained abandoned for more than 100 years. Many of the structures disappeared, though some of the houses continued to be used. Most notable was the house of Samuel Worcester, who was called \"the Messenger,\" and a missionary to the Cherokee. When its landowners deeded land to be commissioned to the state for preservation, the Worcester House, the largest remaining structure, had been vacant for two years. It had deteriorated in that time.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1950 the site was designated by Congress as the New Echota Marker National Memorial. \nIn March 1954, the archeologist Lewis Larsen from the Georgia Historical Commission, and five associates were assigned to oversee the work of excavating New Echota. The team uncovered evidence not only of the Cherokee settlement in New Echota, but also of much earlier indigenous cultures. They asked the National Park Service archeologist Joe Caldwell and two more workers to join them for the next two months as they continued excavation. The group recovered a Spanish coin dated 1802, crockery, household wares, bootery remains, a small quantity of lead, and 1700 other artifacts. They identified 600 items as having belonged to the Cherokee. In addition to the standard finds and remains of many buildings, Larsen and Caldwell astonished the world by discovering much of the type syllabary that was once used to print the \"Cherokee Phoenix\".\n\nOn March 13, 1957, following the news of these archeological finds, the State of Georgia authorized reconstruction of the town of New Echota as a state park. They reconstructed such buildings as the Council House, the Supreme Court, the printer shop, a building of the \"Cherokee Phoenix\", a common Cherokee cabin representing a home of an average family, and a middle-class Cherokee home, including outbuildings. Vann's Tavern, which had been owned by Chief James Vann, is a restored building, for which modern nails and replacement wooden parts were used. It was relocated from Forsyth County, Georgia (Chief Vann had owned 14 taverns across the state of Georgia), as the original New Echota Vann Tavern was destroyed. The park contains the site of the former Elias Boudinot house, which serves as a memorial to Boudinot. The Worcester House was restored to its 19th-century condition. Together the buildings of the complex form an open-air museum.\n\nOther sites are not open to the public, as they are now on private property. Across from the New Echota park are two farmhouse sites, formerly owned by white men who had married Cherokee women. These sites are now part of an Elks Club golf course.\n\nThe New Echota Historical Park was opened to the public in 1962. Inside the office of the \"Cherokee Phoenix\" were displayed 600 pieces of type which had been used for the first American Indian newspaper. Later some type was moved to the museum and research facility which was built by the park. The Newtown Trail is a 1.2 mile interpreted trail that takes tourists to Town Creek (inside the center of New Echota), where the majority of the Cherokee had camped when the Council was in session. In 1973, the Department of Natural Resources, also known as Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites, took over New Echota Park; it continues to operate and maintain this historic site.\nThe site was designated in 1973 by the US Department of Interior as a National Historic Landmark, the highest recognition in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

Made on location in Southern California, \"The Wild Angels\" was the first film to associate actor Peter Fonda with Harley-Davidson motorcycles and 1960s counterculture. It inspired the biker film genre that continued into the early 1970s.\n\n\"The Wild Angels\", released by American International Pictures (AIP), stars Fonda as the fictitious Hells Angels San Pedro, California chapter president \"Heavenly Blues\" (or \"Blues\"), Nancy Sinatra as his girlfriend \"Mike\", Bruce Dern as doomed fellow outlaw \"the Loser\", and Dern's then real-life wife Diane Ladd as the Loser's on-screen wife, \"Gaysh\".\n\nSmall supporting roles are played by Michael J. Pollard and Gayle Hunnicutt and, according to literature promoting the film, members of the Hells Angels from Venice, California. Members of the Coffin Cheaters motorcycle club also appeared.\n\nIn 1967 AIP followed this film with \"Devil's Angels\", \"The Glory Stompers\" with Dennis Hopper, and \"The Born Losers\".\n\nIn between sprees featuring drugs, fights, sexual assault, loud revving Harley chopper engines and bongo drums, the Angels ride out to Mecca, California in the desert to look for the Loser's stolen motorcycle. One of the Angels find what they say is a piece of the Loser's motorcycle in a garage that is the hang-out of a Mexican group. The two groups brawl with the Angels apparently winning. The police arrive and the Angels escape but the Loser gets separated from the others and is left behind. He steals a police motorcycle but is not able to lose the policeman who is pursuing him or evade the road block that the police have in place. Eventually one of the officers shoots the Loser in the back, putting him in the hospital.\n\nBlues leads a small group of Angels that sneaks him out of the hospital. One of the other Angels attempts to rape a nurse (Kim Hamilton) who happens to hear a noise and comes into the room. Blues pulls the other Angel away, forcing him to stop the attempted rape, but the nurse sees Blues and identifies Blues to police (It is never resolved whether the nurse identifies Blues in error as the man who attacked her, or if she identified him only as one of the people who got the Loser out of the hospital). Without proper medical care, the Loser goes into shock and dies. His cohorts forge a death certificate and arrange a church funeral in the Loser's rural hometown. Blues loses his temper and interrupts the minister's sermon. The other Angels follow his lead and have another \"party\". The Angels remove the Loser from his Nazi flag-draped casket, sit him up and place a joint in his mouth, knock out the minister, place him in the casket, and two Angels drug and rape the Loser's grieving widow, Gaysh, while Blues is apparently raping another woman.\n\nLater, the Angels proceed to the Sequoia Grove cemetery to bury the Loser. There, the locals throw stones at the Angels and provoke a fight. As police sirens approach and everyone scatters, Mike begs Blues to leave immediately, but he refuses and tells her to leave with another member of the gang. Blues stays behind, and before starting to bury his friend on his own, says with resignation, \"There's nowhere to go.\"\n\n\nRoger Corman became interested in making a film about the Hells Angels after seeing a photo of a biker funeral in the January 1966 issue of \"Life\" magazine . Corman approached AIP, Charles B. Griffith was hired to write a screenplay. Griffith's first draft was a near-silent movie which contrasted the bikers with the story of a police motorcycle cop. Corman did not like it and had Griffith rewrite it. Corman still was not happy and gave it to Peter Bogdanovich to rewrite. Bogdanovich had met Corman socially and agreed to write an adventure script in the vein of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" or \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" \"only cheap\"; Corman pulled Bogdanovich off that project and paid him $300 to work on \"Wild Angels\". Bogdanovich later estimated he rewrote 80% of the script. He later directed second unit and did various other odd jobs.\n\nGeorge Chakiris and Peter Fonda were originally cast in the lead roles. However Chakiris could not ride a motorcycle so he was replaced by Fonda; with Bruce Dern taking Fonda's original role.\n\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin called \"The Wild Angels\" \"OK after about 24 beers\". It opened the Venice Film Festival in 1966, to tepid response. In a 2009 interview, Corman told Mick Garris that the US State Department tried to prevent the film from being shown in Venice on the grounds that it \"did not show America the way it is\". But the film was shown there anyway. \n\nCorman took chances with this subject matter and the Charles B. Griffith–authored screenplay, without being overly graphic, paid dividends commercially: \"The Wild Angels\" was the 16th highest-grossing film of 1966, earning $5.5 million in domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals.\n\nThe film had admissions in France of 531,240 people.\n\nThe movie's success established Fonda as \"a counter culture film star\".\n\nThe film holds a 61% \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews.\n\nWhile promoting another of his 1960s counterculture movies, \"The Trip\", and autographing a movie still from \"The Wild Angels\" depicting Bruce Dern and him sharing one motorcycle, Fonda conceived the film \"Easy Rider\". \n\nEdited samples of dialogue from the film, where Fonda's character Blues explains his attitude toward life to the preacher at Loser's funeral was used at the start of Mudhoney's 1989 track \"In 'n' Out of Grace\" (from \"Superfuzz Bigmuff)\" and later Primal Scream's 1990 single \"Loaded\" (from \"Screamadelica)\". Some of the same sample of dialogue was also featured in the launch trailer of the video game \"Need for Speed\" (2015). Audio of Fonda's speech was also sampled repeatedly in the Edgar Wright film \"The World's End\", as well as repeated by Simon Pegg's character Gary King at the end of the movie.\n\n\"The Wild Angels\" was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on April 1, 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD, on September 11, 2007 as part of \"The Roger Corman Collection\" (movie number seven of a set of eight), and to Blu-ray by Olive Films (under license from MGM) on February 17, 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

On December 7, 1976, he won the WWWF World tag team championship with Chief Jay Strongbow.\n\nIn 1981, Adnan Al-Kaissie joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), in 1990 he joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF formerly WWWF), where he managed Sgt. Slaughter under the name \"General Adnan\". He competed at SummerSlam 1991 with his partners Sgt. Slaughter and Col. Mustafa in a Handicap match with Sid Justice as special guest referee against Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior.\n\nAdnan Al-Kaissy was born Adnan Bin Abdulkareem Ahmed Al-kaissy El Farthie in Baghdad, Iraq. According to his autobiography, he came from a fairly distinguished family, with his father being an imam (Muslim preacher). One of his high school classmates was Saddam Hussein. He had an amateur wrestling career in Iraq and attended Oklahoma State University.\n\nAl-Kaissy began wrestling in the state of Oklahoma in 1959 under the ring name \"Adnan Kaissey\".\n\nKassey wrestled for Pacific Northwest Wrestling in the 1960s and in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the 1970s under the Native American gimmick Billy White Wolf and won the World Tag Team Titles with Chief Jay Strongbow. Needing neck surgery, Kassey agreed to work an injury angle where he had his neck broken by Ken Patera via the Swinging Neckbreaker on TV. After he left the territory for his neck surgery, the 'Indians' were stripped of their titles. He wouldn't return until the early 1990s, using his real name, as a manager.\n\nIn 1967, Adnan, who had married an American woman, became a United States citizen.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he took professional wrestling to Iraq under the direction of Saddam Hussein. In one such match, he defeated André the Giant in Baghdad and he defeated the Scottish Ian Campbell and the Canadian champion George Gordienko in Baghdad. In 1978, he wrestled in Hawaii and was the master of the \"Indian Death Match\" until his arch-rival, Tor Kamata, defeated him. Not long after, he returned briefly to Iraq with the intent of introducing pro wrestling. By this time, his old classmate Saddam was ruler of the country. By his own account, it was a difficult time, for although Kaissey was very popular and had some success introducing professional wrestling to Iraq, Saddam was already becoming paranoid about potential rivals, and he saw Kaissey in this light. Kaissey fled back to the US and never returned, though he kept contact with his family in Baghdad.\n\nIn 1974, Adnan debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling as the Sheik of Sheiks of Baghdad, he teamed with Nikolai Volkoff and they tried to win the NWA North American Tag Team but they failed after losing the Best Two Out Of Three Falls match against Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi at Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium in Aichi, Japan. Later he feuded with the likes of Antonio Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, Kantaro Hoshino, Osamu Kido, Haruka Eigen. After he left NJPW, Adnan returned to the United States, where he wrestled in Eddie Graham's promotion Championship Wrestling from Florida under his real name.\n\nIn 1981, with tensions between the US and Middle East running high, he debuted in the American Wrestling Association as \"Sheik Adnan El Kaissey,\" where his stated goal was to win the AWA title from champion Nick Bockwinkel. He failed at that task, so he then enlisted Jerry Blackwell, now wearing a sheik's outfit and renamed Sheik Ayatollah Jerry Blackwell, to team with him to try to win the AWA tag team titles. That failed, too, so Adnan bought Ken Patera from manager Bobby Heenan to team with Blackwell, and Adnan would act as Blackwell and Patera's manager. The team of Blackwell and Patera captured the AWA World tag team title from Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell. Adnan had to quit wrestling when he was injured, which is the real reason Patera was brought in to team with Blackwell. On April 23, 1983, at the AWA Super Sunday, he teamed with Blackwell in a tag team match against Verne Gagne and Mad Dog Vachon which they lost it. In 1986 at AWA WrestleRock he lost to Verne Gagne in a steel cage; he then teamed with Boris Zhukov in a tag team match against The Midnight Rockers (Marty Jannetty & Shawn Michaels). Kassie later left the AWA, but returned on a November 26, 1988, card in Bloomington, Minnesota, when he managed The Iron Sheik (who he would also later manage in the WWF) in a match against Sgt. Slaughter.\n\nIn the World Wrestling Federation, during the summer of 1990, he allied with Sgt. Slaughter as \"General Adnan,\" and managed him during his pro-Iraqi gimmick in a feud with Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior. During this feud, Slaughter won the WWF title from the Warrior at the 1991 Royal Rumble, and lost it a couple of months later to Hogan at WrestleMania VII. The pair were then joined by Slaughter's former nemesis, The Iron Sheik to form the Triangle Of Terror/Desert Power (Corps of Destruction) who was renamed Colonel Mustafa. Adnan also headlined SummerSlam 1991 with Slaughter and Mustafa against Hogan and Warrior. During the build-up to Survivor Series 1990, the WWE showed what they claimed were \"classified top secret photos released by the Pentagon/CIA\" that featured General Adnan with Saddam Hussein. After Slaughter turned face, Adnan continued to manage Col. Mustafa until leaving the WWF shortly after Royal Rumble 1992.\n\nAl-Kaissie is also featured as a playable character in the \"WWE 2K15\" video game; in where he appears as a downloadable character as part of the \"Path of the Warrior\" Showcase. He was once again featured as a playable character in \"WWE 2K16\".\n\nAfter WWF he then joined American Wrestling Federation (AWF) where he managed \"The Rat Pack\" of Bob Orton Jr, Mr. Hughes & Manny Fernandez. He also managed Hercules Hernandez.\n\nHe formerly managed his own company, the World All-Star Wrestling Alliance, which he co-owned with Ken Patera.\n\nOn November 22, 2006, he appeared on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity & Colmes\" describing his encounters with a young Saddam Hussein.\n\nOn June 30, 2005 Triumph Books published his memoirs in \"The Sheik of Baghdad: Tales of Celebrity and Terror from Pro Wrestling's General Adnan\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1925651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925651", "title": "Limnanthaceae", "text": "Limnanthaceae\n\nThe Limnanthaceae are a small family of annual herbs occurring throughout temperate North America. There are eight species and nineteen taxa currently recognized. Members of this family are prominent in vernal pool communities of California. Some taxa have been domesticated for use as an oil seed crop. Some members are listed as threatened or endangered and have been the focus of disputes over development plans (e.g. \"Limnanthes floccosa\" subsp. \"californica\", \"Limnanthes vinculans\" )\n\nThe Limnanthaceae are members of a recently identified clade (Brassicales) of mustard oil producing plants. They have a sharp flavor similar to mustard greens, radish or capers.\n\nTwo genera are recognized in the family. The monotypic genus \"Floerkea\" inhabits shaded, vernally wet habitats in eastern North American deciduous forests, high montane islands in the great basin and humid coniferous forests along the northwest coast. All seven species of \"Limnanthes\", with one British Columbian exception, occur solely in the California Floristic Province, most commonly occupying grassland or savanna vernal pool habitats. Various taxa of this genus are prominent elements in the flora of the Great Central Valley \"hogwallow\" communities, the coastal prairie, and wet meadows of the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada/Cascade foothills up to 1800 meters. Disjunct populations occur in the Peninsular Ranges just north of the Mexican border and in the Umpqua River valley of central Oregon. In favorable years \"Limnanthes\" can cover large areas with white flowers (hence the common name Meadowfoam) and in hogwallow habitats sometimes forms spectacular rings surrounding the deepest parts of the pools.\n\nTwo sorts of flowers are found in the family, reflecting different breeding systems: some taxa have inconspicuous perianths and reproduce largely by self-pollination. Others have large, showy flowers, usually pentamerous and white, some with varying amounts of yellow or ultraviolet, others with prominent rose or brown veins and anthers. These are fully to predominantly outcrossing, usually pollinated by species of solitary bees in the genera \"Panurginus\", \"Andrena\" and \"Hesperandrina\".\n\nThe Flora of North America Project has chosen a line drawing of \"Floerkea\" to serve as its logo because of this taxon's ubiquitous (but obscure) occurrence in many areas of North America, and the diverse aspects of the family including economic and horticultural value, endangered species status and fruitful subject of scientific research.\n\nLimnanthaceae currently consist of two genera, eight species and nineteen taxa.\n\nLimnanthaceae are all herbaceous annuals. Leaves are alternate, simple or compound with pinnate venation. Flowers are produced singly in the axils of leaves. They have 3, 4 or 5 petals, mostly white. Fruits are ridged or tuberculate shizocarps (nutlets).\n\nWhen Robert Brown created the family Limnanthaceae in 1833 he declared that, \"the place of this new family is not absolutely determined; but it is suggested that in two remarkable points of its structure, namely, the presence of glands subtending the alternate filaments, and the existence of a gynobase, it more nearly approaches to Hypogynous families than to Perigynous, with which it has hitherto been associated\". Ultimately he demurred from assigning a systematic position to his family. Subsequent taxonomists promoted various divergent placements. Bentham and Hooker (1862) decided that given the great similarity of \"Limnanthes\" and \"Floerkea\" to taxa in the Geraniaceae, family status was not warranted; accordingly, they placed both genera in the tribe Limnantheae in that family. Engler and Prantl (1896), however, disagreed, noting that the position of the seed indicated the family should be placed in the Sapindales.\n\nMost recent authors of taxonomic treatises have maintained the family Limnanthaceae but placed it in the order Geraniales, including Thorne (1976) Cronquist (1988), who nevertheless states that Limnanthaceae are, \"without...obvious affinities...\" and Takhtajan (1980). Hutchinson (1973), proposed that Limnanthaceae should be included in Geraniales, but its similarity to Caryophyllales (which he believed is derived from Geraniales) suggested that Limnanthaceae form a link between these two groups.\n\nA number of studies over the years have noted various morphological, developmental and embryological characters at variance with the Geraniales (as well as other groups to which Limnanthaceae have been assigned). Maheshwari and Johri (1956) conducted an extensive investigation of the morphology of \"Floerkea\" noting that, among other things, the herbaceous habit, gynobasic style, unusual type of tetrasporic embryo sac and basal parietal placentation of the unitegmic, tenuinucellate ovules differ from the Geraniales which has among its woody to herbaceous members, (at most) lobed syncarpous gynoecia, monosporic embryo sacs, generally axile placentation and bitegmic, crassinucellate ovules. Additionally the fruit type of Limnanthaceae, a schizocarpic nutlet, is unlike anything in the Geraniales most of which produce capsules. They also found a number of key differences between Limnanthaceae and Sapindales, and concluded that Limnanthaceae should be given their own order.\n\nHofmann and Ludewig (1985) undertook a similar detailed study of the morphology of \"Limnanthes douglasii\" and made systematic inferences from their findings. They concluded that there is nothing in the morphology to suggest a relationship to the Coriariaceae (suggested by Chatin in 1856), Geraniales or the Sapindales (\"sensu\" Cronquist), though they allow that the, \"level in evolution is about the same...\" They also rejected any meaningful similarity between Limnanthaceae and Tropaeolaceae, as suggested by Dahlgren, who noted the shared possession of certain phytochemicals (glucosinolate, myrosinase, erucic acid and eicosenoic acid). They rejected this connection on the grounds that these phytochemicals also occur in the Brassicaceae which is assumed to be unrelated and suggest that the secondary compounds must be convergent. They concluded that the systematic position of Limnanthaceae is uncertain and cannot be presently determined.\n\nDahlgren (1975), who believed strongly in the systematic value of secondary chemicals, placed Limnanthaceae in Capparales with Brassicaceae. He later (1980) placed Limnanthaceae together with Tropaeolaceae in the order Tropaeolales.\n\nBuchner, Halbritter, Prundner and Hesse (1990) investigated the pollen morphology of Limnanthaceae and discovered that the zonosulcate morphology is unlike the pollen of any known angiosperm and therefore relationships cannot be inferred from it. They reiterated Maheshwari and Johri's suggestion that a new order, the Limnanthales, should be created to contain the family.\n\nRodman (1991a, b) included Limnanthaceae in a twin phenetic and cladistic analysis of all 15 taxa then known to produce glucosinolates. In UPGMA phenograms, Limnanthaceae clustered with Balsaminaceae. Similarly, cladistic analysis showed Limnanthaceae either in a clade with Balsaminaceae and sometimes Pentadiplandraceae or in a polytomy with Balsaminaceae, Pentadiplandraceae, Caricacaeae, Centrospermae, and a clade which includes all the rest of the glucosinolate taxa (except \"Drypetes\").\n\nRodman et al. (1993, 1997) assembled additional DNA sequence data sets for glucosinolate taxa and applied cladistic methods to generate hypotheses about relationship. They discovered that all the glucosinolate-producing taxa save \"Drypetes\", form a clade. Despite the paucity of morphological synapomorphies (and therefore, to the surprise of many taxonomists), \"rbcL\" sequences have provided well supported evidence for the group's monophyly. 18S nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences have similarly, though less certainly, indicated a common ancestor for all the glucosinolate containing plants except \"Drypetes\".\n\nThe Angiosperm Phylogeny Group places Limnanthaceae in Brassicales, which is in the Malvid/Rosid II lineage.\n"}

A member of the New Zealand National Party, Groser was a Member of Parliament between 2005 and 2015, and a cabinet minister between 2008 and 2015. He resigned from Parliament on 19 December 2015 to take up the role of New Zealand's ambassador to the United States of America.\n\nHe was born in Perth, Scotland and came to New Zealand with his parents in 1958. After completing his education at Victoria University of Wellington he served as a policy adviser in a number of key departments including Treasury, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Prime Minister's Advisory Group under Robert Muldoon.\n\nIn the 1980s he was appointed New Zealand's chief agricultural negotiator in the GATT Uruguay round before being promoted to Chief Negotiator midway through negotiations. He subsequently became New Zealand's ambassador to Indonesia from 1994 to 1997.\n\nSince then Groser has served as New Zealand's Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and as the WTO's chairman of agricultural negotiations. He was heavily involved in the Doha round of discussions.\n\nIn 2005 Groser opted to leave the civil service and run for Parliament. He was selected to stand as a list-only candidate for the National Party in the 2005 election. He was placed 13th on the list and as a result was comfortably elected.\n\nAfter the 2008 election he was given a Cabinet position with the Conservation and Trade portfolios.\n\nGroser made international headlines in late 2012 when he said that the New Zealand Government would not sign up for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Tim Groser said the 15-year-old agreement was outdated, and that New Zealand was \"ahead of the curve\" in looking for a replacement that would include developing nations.\nIn December 2012, the New Zealand Government announced that it was supporting Groser's bid to become the next Director-General of the World Trade Organization, a position which became vacant at the end of May 2013 with the retirement of Pascal Lamy. Groser's bid was eventually unsuccessful and the Brazilian diplomat Roberto Azevêdo was elected as the Director General of the WTO on May 2013. On 22 March 2015, Edward Snowden's The Intercept news website claimed that New Zealand's signals intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau, had spied on other WTO directorship contenders on behalf of Groser. Known targets included candidates from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, and South Korea.\n\nDespite no official announcement having been made, New Zealand media reported earlier in 2015 that Groser was \"widely expected\" to replace Mike Moore as ambassador to the United States. This was confirmed by prime minister John Key on 7 December 2015, with Groser relinquishing his roles on 14 December. Groser will take up his post as ambassador in early 2016.\n\nIn July 2015, Groser said he believed reasonable people were being \"whipped up into a frenzy\" over issues like pharmaceutical costs and investor-state dispute settlement by people who, for ideological reasons, oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement.\n\nHe resigned from Parliament on 19 December 2015 to take up the role of New Zealand's ambassador to the United States of America.\n\nGroser converted to Islam to marry Milda Emza, an Indonesian Muslim and his second wife, in 1996, during his tenure as ambassador to Indonesia.

He served as Secretary for Scotland in William Ewart Gladstone's short-lived 1886 administration.\n\nDalhousie was born at Aberdour House at Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire on 29 January 1847. He was the eldest son of Admiral George Ramsay, 12th Earl of Dalhousie, and Sarah Frances, daughter of William Robertson of Logan House. The Hon. Charles Maule Ramsay, MP for Forfarshire, was his younger brother. He gained the courtesy title of Lord Ramsay in 1874 when his father succeeded in the earldom of Dalhousie on the death of his first cousin, Fox Maule-Ramsay, 11th Earl of Dalhousie.\n\nHis paternal grandfather was The Hon. John Ramsay (the fourth son of George Ramsay, 8th Earl of Dalhousie).\n\nAfter attending Charterhouse School, he matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford in 1875.\n\nDalhousie followed his father into the Royal Navy, where he served from 1861 to 1879, achieving the rank of Commander. He was Equerry to the Duke of Edinburgh between 1874 and 1876 and an Extra Equerry between 1876 and 1880.\n\nDalhousie was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Liverpool in March 1880, but was forced to resign in July 1880 after succeeding his father in the earldom. After taking his seat in the House of Lords he was appointed a Lord-in-waiting in September 1880 by William Ewart Gladstone, a position he held until the government fell in 1885.\n\nIn April 1886 he succeeded George Trevelyan (who had resigned over Irish Home Rule) as Secretary for Scotland in Gladstone's short-lived 1886 administration, although in contrast to Trevelyan he was not a member of the cabinet. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. He retained this post until the government fell in July 1886. He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1881.\n\nOn 6 December 1877, Lord Dalhousie was married to Lady Ida Louisa Bennet. She was a daughter of Charles Bennet, 6th Earl of Tankerville and Olivia Bennet, Countess of Tankerville (eldest daughter of George Montagu, 6th Duke of Manchester). Together, Lord and Lady Dalhousie had five sons:\n\n\nAfter returning from a trip to the United States in November 1887, the couple were forced to break off their journey in Le Havre after Lady Dalhousie was taken ill. Despite medical attention she died of peritonitis on 24 November, aged 30. After retiring to bed the same night, Lord Dalhousie never awoke, having apparently suffered from an apoplectic fit during the night, thus surviving his wife by less than 24 hours, dying at age 40.\n\n"}
{"id": "1925700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925700", "title": "Sorcerer Hunters", "text": "Sorcerer Hunters\n\nIn the United States the manga was serialized in \"MixxZine\", replacing \"Ice Blade\", which had ended.\n\nSorcerer Hunters is set on the Spooner Continent, where the populace is divided into two groups: the ordinary people, called the Parsoners, and the magic users, the Sorcerers. Marked by the triangles on their foreheads, many Sorcerers dominate, exploit, torment, murder, and enslave the Parsoners of the Spooner Continent.\n\nThe Sorcerer Hunters are a group of warriors who protect humans from the Sorcerers. They are under the command of a holy woman who goes by the name of \"Big Mama\", the head of the popular Stella Church, who seeks to protect Parsoners from the gifted Sorcerers who have chosen to abuse their powers.\n\nThe plot focuses on the adventures of a small family group of Sorcerer Hunters, including the Glace Brothers (Carrot and his younger brother Marron), their childhood friends, the Misu Sisters (Tira and her older sister Chocola), and Gateau Mocha.\n\nFamily (\"La Familia\") is one of the story's main themes, playing a very important role throughout the manga.\n\nAlmost all character names are puns on the names of foods, particularly pastries.\n\nThe style is usually a parody of fantasy clichés, but it occasionally satirizes pop culture in the broader sense. For example, one entire chapter is a dedicated parody of the popular \"Iron Chef\" cooking show. In another one, the characters drink a potion to make them the heroes of various anime series, such as \"Urusei Yatsura\", \"Darkstalkers\", \"Sailor Moon\", and even literary classics, such as Alexandre Dumas's \"The Three Musketeers\" and Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Women\".\n\nThe primary protagonist and the de facto leader of the Sorcerer Hunters, Carrot is an apparently powerless boy who carries a longsword, but almost never uses it due to extreme imprecision. However, he does have one ace in the hole. When he comes into contact with a Sorcerer's magic, his Aranju and Zoanthropy activate one of his 12 beast genes and transform him into a giant, out-of-control monster. It takes Tira Misu to bring him back to his normal state in the animated series; in the manga, she wears Carrot's monster form down while his brother Marron pulls the magic out of Carrot. Carrot's forms are based on the animals of the Chinese zodiac, and he has been known to transform twice during a fight.\n\nCarrot is a lascivious pervert with a ravenous libido; he propositions nearly every woman he sees with either a date or sex. In fact, the only two women whom he does not pursue are Tira and Chocola, who really love him, and both of them take great offense to Carrot's lustful pursuits. In his defense, Carrot doesn't view himself as being unfaithful to the Misu sisters; he has a brotherly love for them rather than a romantic type, and he feels uneasy with the notion of being with Tira or Chocola romantically and thus, uses this rationale to chase after other girls. Unfortunately, this doesn't suit very well with the sisters, who think he ignores their affections. As a result, when they are not in battle with sorcerers, Carrot is often the victim of the Misu sisters' barrage of whippings as punishment for his constant infidelity (or what they perceive as infidelity) towards them, which is another reason Carrot fears both the sisters. Later in the series, he professes his love to both Tira and Chocola and even marries Tira at the end of the manga. However, even though Chocola let her sister marry him, she's still bound and determined to bear Carrot's first child.\nMarron is Carrot's younger brother, although he appears to be older due to his height, as well as his docile, mature manner. Unlike Carrot, Marron is a gentleman. He is an expert practitioner of Eastern style magic, which does not require one to be born a Sorcerer. He can conjure the Four Symbols. Marron is also a very skilled swordsman, but he rarely uses his sword skills. He is pursued by Gateau because of his beauty. Despite being a male he's beautiful enough to catch Gateau's attention. While he seems to mostly ignore Gateau's advances, there is a running gag with his overt, suspicious affection for his older brother, more pronounced in the manga than the anime. Marron is said to be gay but is really more asexual.\n\nGrowing up, Carrot always protected Marron from other kids who bullied him on account of his rather feminine looks. Now in their teens, Marron returns the favor by taking out anyone who harms him, his friends, and especially his older brother Carrot.\n\nThough powerful, Marron does have some weak points shown better in the manga, such as a total lack of tolerance for alcohol. He's named after the European confection.\nThe oldest of the five Sorcerer Hunters, Gateau was not raised in the Sorcerer Hunters' village on Mt. Saint Hordic; as a result, he is one of the few to join in adulthood (in the anime, he and Éclair grew up with the Glace brothers and Misu sisters). His advantage is immense physical strength due to a lifetime of martial arts training; he is also partially immune to magic due to that strength. Gateau's parents were killed by Sacher Torte, and his younger sister Eclair was abducted at that time; shortly afterwards, he met Chocola and joined her team.\n\nGateau is excessively macho and also bisexual, as shown in the manga by his statement \"Beauty transcends gender.\" He also has a libido that nearly rivals that of Carrot, the only main character to whom Gateau has no attraction. Unlike Carrot, however, Gateau knows when to put his libido in check.\n\nGateau's main hobby is exhibitionism, often stripping to a speedo and posing, accompanied by a cry of \"Look at meee!\" There's a running gag with him openly showing attraction to Marron due to his physical beauty, only to be ignored by the younger mystic.\n\nHis first name means \"cake\" in French.\nTira, along with Chocola, was raised by Carrot and Marron's father and mother, Onion and Apricot. She resembles Little Red Riding Hood, dressed in an oversized cloak and glasses.\n\nShe seems very meek and shy, but reveals a bolder side of her personality in combat, pulling away her cloak and revealing her whip and leather Dominatrix gear. She is very skilled with the whip and is the one who usually beats Carrot down after he transforms, turning him back to human form in the anime.\n\nTira is deeply in love with Carrot, but due to her shy nature she isn't very up front until later in the manga, so her love for Carrot is an open secret. Tira gets jealous when Carrot lusts after other girls, and along with her sister Chocola, she whips Carrot as punishment for his constant skirt-chasing. Tira even gets miffed when she sees Chocola incessantly flirting with Carrot.\n\nIn battle, Tira occasionally uses a whip. She also has basic knowledge of Gaia's magic, which is derived from nature; magic she learned from Apricot Glace, though she is only able to heal with it. Her dominatrix attire in the manga and OVAs is the traditional ensemble consisting of black leather stiletto-heel boots, bustiers, corsets, and spiked dog chains. Her anime attire, however, has a more colorful style, consisting of a tight, skimpy, orange and white leotard with an emerald \"tie\", white gloves and heels. In the manga, her dominatrix outfit changes often—sometimes even during the same story. In the anime, she appeared in her manga outfit after being reborn.\n\nAt the end of the manga, Tira finally admits her love to Carrot and marries him.\n\nHer name is a pun on the Italian dessert.\nChocola is the sexy, straightforward, sometimes high-maintenance, short-tempered and somewhat nymphomaniac older sister of Tira. She is madly in love with Carrot (whom she calls \"Darling\" although there have been few times she's called Carrot by name) and literally throws herself at him. Often, Carrot is petrified of her and flees from her advances. Still, she keeps a close bond with Tira, protecting her when it's needed and fighting in her name. She and Gateau are a separate team early in the manga, but eventually all five form a single group.\n\nChocola is a dominatrix like Tira, but is far more violent and savage than her sister, and is also able to turn Carrot back to normal in the anime—after beating him up even harder than Tira. Her main weapon is her garrote and she is incredibly skilled with it. It's suggested that her character was inspired by Lum from Urusei Yatsura.\n\nChocola's dominatrix attire in the manga and OVAs resembles that of a Nazi German soldier. It consists of a leather cap (with the Nazi symbols of the eagle carrying the swastika as well as the Gestapo Death's Head), suspenders that barely cover her ample bust, leather pants and boots (her dominatrix attire in the manga and OVAs is also reminiscent of that worn by Charlotte Rampling in the 1974 film \"The Night Porter\"). However, in the anime television series, her attire is more reflective of a biker: a slightly modest red leather bra top, along with similar leather pants, boots and cap (sans the Nazi symbol), with red gloves. At the end of the anime, after being reborn, Chocola appears in her manga outfit with her sister.\n\nEven though she loves Carrot sincerely, Chocola is a very jealous girl and is quite vicious and ferocious towards Carrot when she catches him cheating on her, and whips him mercilessly (though she is most vicious to those that harm her friends, in particular Tira and Carrot). Normally, however, she is very amorous and romantic towards him, always smothering him in deep love and affection, which is the reason Carrot keeps his distance from her between the two sisters. Chocola often has romantic/sexual dreams of her and Carrot together. These shōjoesque fantasies usually feature Carrot as very well-groomed and debonair-looking, as well as often ending in Carrot making love to her; in which she often goes into complete ecstasy. Oddly enough, her own image in these fantasies show her to be either meek or submissive, which is a big change from what she truly is.\n\nAt the end of the manga, Chocola allows her sister to marry Carrot, though that doesn't stop her from trying to seduce him and bearing his children.\n\nAn important part of the plot is that the five Sorcerer Hunters are reincarnations of five gods. They are:\n\n\nCarrot is the reincarnation of the Destruction god Hakaishin while the other four Hunters are the reincarnations of the four gods that subdued him, which explains why it takes Tira and/or Chocola as well as even Marron to bring Carrot back to his normal human form.\nBig Mama is an imposing being with great magical abilities. Her real name is Kanure Stella and she, alongside Sacher Torte, formed the Sorcerer Hunters, and henceforth dedicated her life to the punishment of evil Sorcerers. The highest rank of the Sorcerer Hunters, the Haz Knights, are her personal bodyguards.\nAlso known as Dotta, she is Big Mama's messenger and assistant. She is one of only two survivors of the Winged People. She wears qipao, and usually has her hair up in small buns.\n\nThe Haz Knights are the most elite Sorcerer Hunters, with amazing powers, augmented by magical armor. Mille is the first to appear in the manga, while the others don't appear until volumes nine, ten and eleven.\nAlso known as Milphey-uy, he is a transvestite who most often acts with Carrot's group and has a thorough knowledge of necromancy and all kind of magic. His power comes from his Guardian Spirit, the Phoenix. He is pansexual and constantly flings himself at both Onion and Carrot, which draws more ire from Tira and Chocola, and flirts with them, though he's also shown some degree of interest in Gateau and Marron.\n\nA very youthful-looking blonde girl with a slow manner, she has the power of super speed.\n\nHe is a master of magical chemistry, using test tubes and flasks as powerful magic explosives, as well as for other offensive and defensive uses.\n\nThis man is another highly skilled mystic, specializing in ice.\n\nA former Haz Knight who left the group to raise a family. He wields twin axes that can inflict serious damage. He married Apricot Anzu, a fellow hunter and is Carrot and Marron's father. His appearance is very similar to Carrot's, with the addition of a facial scar and a far more muscular body. After the death of Apricot, it seems he has become as much of a lecher as his oldest son, at times. Of the two he acts as if he dislikes Carrot, though adores Marron for the resemblance to his dead wife.\n\nA former Sorcerer Hunteress who can change into her own outfit and uses a knife as well as nature magic. She was \"killed\" long ago by the Lord of Darkness Almond Rasseru who possessed her body. However, her soul escaped and inhabited a new one—that of a female artificial human named Mousse. She becomes the head of the Stella Church at the end of the manga. She is Onion's wife and the Glace brothers' mother.\n\nA sorcerer of noble birth who is after the Crystal Magicians, who kidnapped his Parsoner girlfriend Audrey. He becomes an ally of the Sorcerer Hunters during the Crystal Magicians' story arc, although Gateau is reluctant to trust him. After the Magicians are defeated, he proposes to Audrey and vows to aid the Hunters whenever they ask.\n\nNicknamed the \"Butterfly of Death\", Shicho is a kunoichi ally of the Soga Clan who has poison in her blood.\n\nA pint-sized sorcerer with a lisp, he looks far more like his father who makes an appearance in the manga.\n\nSalad Chips is Potato's short and rather young-looking mother. She is over 30 though looks no more than 12.\n\nAn elder at the village of hunters who resembles Yoda from Star Wars, he offers wisdom and support to Sorcerer Hunters though his true identity has a far darker twist (see below in Enemies).\n\nThe Crystal Magicians, who turn humans into gems used for mystical purposes. They are appropriately named after jewels.\n\nThe first of the Crystal Magicians to appear. He was responsible for kidnapping Qui Shurein's girlfriend Audrey and turning her into a gem. He tries to do the same to Carrot, but is killed by Gateau.\n\nThe leader of the Crystal Magicians. Appearing initially as a mischievous young boy, he later reveals his true age and form (a centuries-old man) to the Sorcerer Hunters. He is killed by Carrot.\n\nThe most powerful of the Crystal Magicians. He uses a magic void to draw Marron in, but is burned alive from within by Marron's phoenix spell.\n\nRa's lover. She kisses Carrot and Gateau to place them under her control. She later tries to trap Chocola into a crystal, but is impaled by Chocola's garotte.\n\nA sorcerer doctor and wielder of the Plantina Energy, he was once an ally of Big Mama. He helped found the Sorcerer Hunters, but eventually left because of differences between himself and Mama. He is Chocola and Tira's adoptive father. He's named after the Austrian dessert.\n\nA powerful Necromancer. He seeks the \"Necronomicon\", a book that will give him absolute control over the dead. He is defeated by Carrot in his beast form and ultimately killed by Mille Feuille.\n\nThe Sorcerer Hunter Killers\n\n\nThe Five Guardian Spirits, assembled by Sacher to guard the Plantina Stones. They are named after stars.\n\n\nLendoll Carlsburg, the sonic gunslinger from the town of Tamales who gave the hunters all they could handle.\n\nFour Lords of Darkness, ancient demons who once terrorized the world.\n\n\nMany fans of the original manga disliked the anime version, viewing it as being unfaithful to the manga with its many differences in story (adapted by Hiroyuki Kawasaki) and character design (adapted by Keiji Gotō). There is some debate over whether Sorcerer Hunters was edited to match with Japanese broadcast standards for children's television or whether the show was altered to appeal more to younger audiences without controversy. The OVA uses the original character designs, which are again adapted by Gotō. Many characters who did not appear in the television series appeared in the OVA. Also, Tira and Chocola (who are 18 and 19 years old respectively) look physically mature in their dominatrix alter egos.\n\n\"Sorcerer Hunters\" was later adapted into a 26-episode anime television series by Xebec, which was the studio's first production, and aired on TV Tokyo from October 3, 1995 to March 3, 1996. In North America, the series is licensed by ADV Films. On May 25, 2019, Discotek Media licensed both the TV series and the OVA series. \n\nThe TV series was followed by a three-episode OVA, also by Xebec.\n\nSorcerer Hunters has three releases in dramatic audio format in which the main roles are all performed by the same actors as in the TV series and OVA. The first set, Sorcerer Hunters Whip I - V, was released on June 22, 1994. This was followed in 1995 by Sorcerer Hunters II, The Monthly Collection: 1st Season - 5th Season. The third set, Sorcerer Hunters SP, came out in 1996.\n\n\n\n"}

It became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans drafted by Gosplan. GOELRO is the transliteration of the Russian abbreviation for \"State Commission for Electrification of Russia\" (Государственная комиссия по электрификации России).\n\nThe Commission and Plan were initiated and supervised by Vladimir Lenin. Lenin's belief in the central importance of electrification to the achievement of communism is represented by his statement that\nThe Commission was established by the Presidium of the VSNKh on February 21, 1920 in accordance with February 3, 1920 VTsIK resolution on the electrification plan development. The director of the Commission was Gleb Krzhizhanovsky. About 200 scientists and engineers participated, including Genrikh Graftio, Ivan Alexandrov, Mikhail Shatelen and others. By the end of 1920 the Commission devised the \"Russian SFSR Electrification Plan\" (), that was approved subsequently by the 8th Congress of Soviets on December 22, 1920 and accepted by the Sovnarkom (Soviet government) on December 21, 1921.\n\nThe Plan represented a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country. Lenin's stated goal for it was \"...the organization of industry on the basis of modern, advanced technology, on electrification which will provide a link between town and country, will put an end to the division between town and country, will make it possible to raise the level of culture in the countryside and to overcome, even in the most remote corners of land, backwardness, ignorance, poverty, disease, and barbarism.\"\n\nThe GOELRO Plan was implemented during a 10- to 15-year period. According to the Plan, the territory of the Russian SFSR was divided into eight regions, with distinct development strategies due to specific features of each region: Southern Region, Central Industrial region, Northern Region, Ural Region, Volga Region, Turkestan Region, Caucasus Region and Western Siberia Region. The Plan included construction of a network of 30 regional power plants, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises. It was intended to increase the total national power output per year to 8.8 billion kWh, as compared to 1.9 billion kWh in Imperial Russia in 1913. Soviet propaganda claimed that the plan was basically fulfilled by 1931. In reality, only three out of ten hydroelectric stations were built by 1930: the Volkhov, the Svir, and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Stations. The goal of 8.8 billion kWh nevertheless was reached in 1931, and national power output continued to increase significantly, reaching 13.5 billion kWh by the end of the first five-year plan in 1932, 36 billion kWh by 1937, and 48 billion kWh by 1940.\n\nIvan Alexandrov later directed the Regionalisation Commission of Gosplan which divided the Soviet Union into thirteen European and eight Asiatic economic regions, using rational economic planning rather than \"the vestiges of lost sovereign rights\".\n\nThe term \"Ilyich's lamp\" (лампочка Ильича) for an electric bulb, a reference to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, is a reminder of the Plan period.\n\n"}

It is one of several dialects in the Western Desert language group.\n\nThe name \"luritja\" is thought to derive from the Arrernte word \"lurinya\", 'foreigner'. It appears to have originally been applied by Arrernte speakers to people of the Western Desert Language group who had relocated onto Arrernte lands in the process of moving (or being moved) from remote desert areas to the region closer to Alice Springs. Over time younger generations have taken on the term as their ethnonym, possibly unaware of its origin.\n\nThe Luritja lands include areas to the west and south of Alice Springs, extending around the edge of Arrernte country. The area surrounding Papunya, including Mount Liebig is often referred to as Papunya Luritja, both in land and language, while areas to the south-east around Aputula and Maryvale are often referred to as Titjikala Luritja (Maryvale is the name of the cattle station on Titjikala land). The area around Ulpanyali and Watarrka National Park (Kings Canyon) is also referred to as Luritja country and the dialect of Luritja spoken there is referred to as Southern Luritja (It's identical to Titjikala Luritja). The variety of Luritja spoken at Kintore is often referred to as Pintupi/Luritja.\n\nPapunya Luritja is the variety of Luritja spoken around the community of Papunya, and also west through Mount Liebig to Kintore. Like Luritja generally, Papunya Luritja is a dialect of the Western Desert Language and is closely related to the Pintupi language of the area around Kintore and further west. Papunya Luritja has probably also been influenced by western varieties of Arrernte as well as Warlpiri.\n\nThis variety is also a dialect of the Western Desert Language spoken in Titjikala. While it is quite similar to Papunya Luritja, it shows notable differences probably having been derived mostly from Pitjantjatjara as well as being influenced by Antakarinya and the more southern varieties of Arrernte.\n\nThe total population of Luritja people (including Papunya Luritja) is probably in the thousands making them the third largest of the Central Australian Aboriginal populations, behind Arrernte and Pitjantjatjara.\n\nThe Luritja area relies heavily on the sale of artwork, and Luritja artwork has a large number of famous artists, and many companies that specifically cater for the sale of Luritja art. The Papunya Tula company in particular is world-renowned for its artists, most of whom reside at Papunya and Kintore.\n"}

Rowe Sr.\n\nJames Gordon Rowe Sr. (1857 – August 2, 1929) was an American jockey and horse trainer elected to the Hall of Fame for Thoroughbred Horse racing. He won the Belmont Stakes twice as a jockey and 8 times as a trainer. He had 34 champion horses to his credit, more than any other trainer in the Hall of Fame.\n\nRowe was born in the environs of Richmond, Virginia, and went to work at a racetrack as a boy of 10 years old. He went from an apprentice rider to being considered the leading jockey in the U.S. at age 14, a position he kept from 1871 to 1873.\n\nWith age came weight, and in 1875, at the age of 18, Rowe retired from racing as a jockey. He began working for the Davis & Hall racing stable as an assistant to the trainer, David W. McConn. Rowe eventually became head trainer for the stable.\n\nIn 1879, Rowe joined the Dwyer Brothers Stable. On May 17, 1881, with the future Hall of Fame horse Hindoo, he became the youngest trainer to win the Kentucky Derby. Hindoo won eighteen straight races that year. The Dwyers pushed their horses hard, in a manner that would be unacceptable and illegal today. Rowe quit the Dwyers in 1885 in a dispute regarding over-racing their horses, especially the mare Miss Woodford.\n\nRowe trained for Alfred F. Walcott's Fairfax Stable, after which he was a public or freelance trainer until 1889. While he ran his own stable one of his clients was August Belmont. In 1891, Rowe was hired as the race starter at minor racetracks. In January 1892, he was hired by the Board of Control as starter for the Monmouth Park Association, Coney Island Jockey Club, Brooklyn Jockey Club, and the New York Jockey clubs.\n\nIn 1899, Rowe became head trainer for the racing operations of James R. Keene. In 1911, he took charge of the racing stable of Harry Payne Whitney, for whom he trained his second Kentucky Derby winner. Rowe was the leading money winner in horse racing in 1908, 1913, and 1915, the year the Whitney stables' Regret became the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby. Regret was named 1915's Horse of the Year. She was later elected to the Racing Hall of Fame. Rowe had four second-place finishes with horses in the Preakness Stakes and won it with Broomspun in 1921.\n\nDespite his many victories in important races, it is for the performance of his horses in the Belmont Stakes that Rowe is most remembered. Between 1883 and 1913, he won the Belmont Stakes 8 times, more than any other trainer in history. One of those victories came in 1908 with a horse named Colin, who went unbeaten during his 15-race career. Rowe considered Colin to be the greatest horse he had ever trained. He once said that for his epitaph he wanted only these words: \"He trained Colin.\"\n\nFollowing the formation of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955, James Rowe Sr. was inducted posthumously. His son, James Jr., also had a very successful career as a trainer but died at age 42 of a heart attack.\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the Continental Wrestling Association, Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nDennis Condrey was born in Florence, Alabama, and started wrestling in 1973 in the Tennessee area, wrestling for promoter Nick Gulas. He would also wrestle in the Mid-Atlantic area as well. In July 1974, he won the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship with his brother-in-law, Joe Turner. Three months later, he would win the NWA Tri-State Heavyweight Championship. By the end of 1974, Condrey teamed up with Phil Hickerson, and became known as the Bicentennial Kings, and was managed by \"Kangaroo\" Al Costello. In March 1977, he began wrestling for Jerry Jarrett's promotion in Memphis. Four months later, he would make his first international trip to Canada, wrestling in the Maritimes. In 1978, Condrey went to Alabama's Southeast Championship Wrestling. After the Bicentennial Kings broke up in 1979, Condrey formed the Big C's with Don Carson. In 1980, after Carson retired, Condrey teamed up with Randy Rose, and formed the Midnight Express, alongside Norvell Austin. They dominated the tag team scene there until Condrey left for Mid-South wrestling in 1984.\n\nOnce in Mid-South, Condrey formed a new version of the Midnight Express with Bobby Eaton with Jim Cornette as their manager. They also started a legendary feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express that carried over into the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985.\n\nIn early 1986, Condrey and Eaton won the NWA World Tag Team Titles from the Rock 'n' Roll Express on \"Superstars on the Superstation\" and feuded with them until Condrey left the promotion in early 1987. He literally left overnight, giving no notice to Cornette, Eaton, or the NWA.\n\nCondrey would reunite with former partner Randy Rose in the AWA under manager Paul E. Dangerously. \"Loverboy\" Dennis and \"Ravishing\" Randy called themselves \"The Original Midnight Express\", and claimed the right to the name, which had since been used by Condrey and Eaton (and later by \"Beautiful\" Bobby Eaton and \"Sweet\" Stan Lane) in the NWA.\n\nThey would defeat Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee for the AWA World Tag Team titles on October 30, 1987, in Whitewater, WI. They would have a two-month title reign, losing the titles to the returning Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) on December 27, 1987 in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAfter wrestling the independents, Condrey returned to the NWA in November 1988, alongside Randy Rose and Paul E. Dangerously.\n\nDuring the November 5 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Jim Cornette received an anonymous phone call. The caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team titles to the Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on TBS carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on.\n\nThe teams wrestled at Starrcade '88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in the NWA for months, building up to a 6-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per-view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, due to changes in ownership, the NWA was going through booking upheaval with Dusty Rhodes being replaced as head booker by George Scott. Jim Crockett, Jr. already had a problem with Condrey due to his previous overnight disappearance and Scott had previous animosity with Rose, so Scott's appearance as top booker made for the catalyst to bury both teams and the feud. The feud was cooled off and the \"loser leaves town\" match was going to be used to kick one of them out of the territory once and for all and continue to bury the other. At the last minute, Dennis Condrey once again decided to leave the NWA, rather than take his PPV payoff and give Crockett and Scott the satisfaction. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward.\n\nCondrey returned to Alabama (now known as Continental) in the Spring of 1989. On July 22, 1989, Condrey defeated Tom Prichard to win the CWF Heavyweight Championship, before losing the title back to Prichard on December 6. He would also form a short-lived tag team called the \"Lethal Weapons\" with Doug Gilbert. Together, they went to the New England area to wrestle for International Championship Wrestling. On December 30, 1989, they defeated Phil Apollo and Vic Steamboat, who was subbing for Apollo's partner Eric Sbraccia, who no-showed, to win the ICW Tag Team Championship. They held onto the belts until March 1990, when they left the promotion. Condrey retired shortly thereafter.\n\nCondrey came back to team with Eaton in 2004 and, along with Stan Lane, they have been wrestling as the Midnight Express in the independents and feuding with the Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Fantastics.\n\nCondrey signed to World Wrestling Entertainment in March 2010 as a developmental trainer. He was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling and works with the rookies on the NXT roster. Condrey retired in 2011, after wrestling his last match on October 15, against Bill Mulkey at the AWE Night of Legends.\n\n\n\n"}

The year-long story followed the adventures of a number of individuals in a world wherein a human-zombie war has been narrowly averted and corporate marketing interests are just starting to target the undead as a viable demographic. Comprising 48 episodes, each five to ten minutes long, the series ran from October 2003 to November 2004, and attracted a cult following due to its black humor and commentary on modern marketing culture.\n\n\"Dead End Days\" was created by producer Brad Fox, director Matthew Hoos, and screenwriter Jason Patrick Rothary, childhood friends from Calgary, Alberta.

Construction by the United States Army began in June 1941. The first aircraft landed there in January 1942, as a link in the North Atlantic air ferry route in World War II. The base had a peak population of about 4,000 American servicemen, and it is estimated that some 10,000 aircraft landed there en route to the war in Europe and North Africa.\n\nSoon after the United States entered the war, the War Department decided to deploy Major General Carl Spaatz's Eighth Air Force to Britain, putting the North Atlantic ferry route facilities constructed by the Corps to an early test. Radioing from Bluie West 1, while crossing the Atlantic in mid-June 1942, Spaatz ordered the movement to begin. The P-38 and P-39 fighters, piloted by combat crews who had been given special training in long-distance flying, were escorted by the longer-range B-17 bombers.\n\nWith stops at the Canadian-built base at Goose Bay in Labrador, Bluie West 1 in Southern Greenland, and Reykjavik or Keflavik in Iceland, the aircraft could fly from the new Presque Isle Army Airfield in northern Maine to Prestwick Airport in Scotland with no leg of the journey longer than . Other important bases in Greenland were Bluie West Eight near the present-day town of Kangerlussuaq, and Bluie East One on the almost-uninhabited east coast.\n\nBad weather is frequent in Southern Greenland, and Narsarsuaq is virtually surrounded by high mountains, making the approach to the steel-mat runway exceedingly difficult. The usual approach was a low-level flight up a fjord. Because the runway slopes up west to east, landings were (and still are predominantly) made to the east, with take-offs to the west, regardless of the wind direction.\n\nBW-1's importance declined post World War II, but the U.S. Air Force maintained it as Narsarsuaq Air Base during the early Cold War years, when it served as a refuelling station for jet fighters and for helicopters crossing the North Atlantic. The runway by this time had been paved with concrete. Jets require a longer take-off run than do propeller-driven aircraft, and the air base used a small tugboat to move icebergs out of the way of planes taking off over the basin west of the runway. There is a detailed account of a visit to BW-1 in the early days of World War II by Ernest K. Gann, in the book Fate Is The Hunter.\n\nThe advent of aerial refueling, and the opening of the larger Thule Air Base in northern Greenland, made the base redundant, and it was turned over to the Danish government of Greenland in 1958. It is currently known as Narsarsuaq Airport and served by regular flights from Reykjavík, Iceland during the summer season, as well as by commuter aircraft from Kangerlussaq and other Greenlandic airfields. There is no control tower, and ceiling is required, on all approach procedures.\n\n\n"}

A majority of his works are within the field of philosophy and method of sociology, history of political theories and political science. In the past two decades, his work was mainly devoted to the study of Nietzsche and Heidegger.\n\nĐurić studied law, philosophy and classic philology in Belgrade, where he obtained his PhD with the thesis on \"Ideas of the Natural Law in Greek Sophists\" (1954). He was professor at Law School from 1954 until 1973, when, for political reasons, he was removed from the University. In 1954 he was appointed as Research Fellow at the University of Belgrade's Law School, where he was later promoted to Assistant Professor in 1957, Associate Professor in 1964, and full Professor in 1969. He taught History of Political Theory, General Sociology and Methodology of Social Science.\n\nIn 1972, Mihailo Đurić was expelled from the University, tried and sentenced to 9 months in prison for his criticism of the 1971 Constitutional Amendments as well as his opposition to demolishing of the Petar Petrović Njegoš chapel on Mount Lovćen. The discussion at the Law Faculty was delivered in a public discussion within the University building and the article on Njegoš in a literary review written in opposition to the destruction.\n\nDuring his trial and imprisonment, many public figures expressed their opposition to then Yugoslav communist government, among them philosopher Ernst Bloch.\n\nAfter the release from prison Đurić was formally employed at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, from 1974 until 1989, when he returned to University. From his release from prison (1972), he was also a visiting professor at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin and Augsburg. In 1991, after rehabilitation, he returned to Law School.

{"id": "1925764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925764", "title": "Per Martin-Löf", "text": "Per Martin-Löf\n\nPer Erik Rutger Martin-Löf (; ; born 8 May 1942) is a Swedish logician, philosopher, and mathematical statistician. He is internationally renowned for his work on the foundations of probability, statistics, mathematical logic, and computer science. Since the late 1970s, Martin-Löf's publications have been mainly in logic. In philosophical logic, Martin-Löf has wrestled with the philosophy of logical consequence and judgment, partly inspired by the work of Brentano, Frege, and Husserl. In mathematical logic, Martin-Löf has been active in developing intuitionistic type theory as a constructive foundation of mathematics; Martin-Löf's work on type theory has influenced computer science.\n\nUntil his retirement in 2009, Per Martin-Löf held a joint chair for Mathematics and Philosophy at Stockholm University.\n\nHis brother Anders Martin-Löf is now emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University; the two brothers have collaborated in research in probability and statistics. The research of Anders and Per Martin-Löf has influenced statistical theory, especially concerning exponential families, the expectation-maximization method for missing data, and model selection.\n\nPer Martin-Löf is an enthusiastic bird-watcher; his first scientific publication was on the mortality rates of ringed birds.\n\nIn 1964 and 1965, Martin-Löf studied in Moscow under the supervision of Andrei N. Kolmogorov. He wrote a 1966 article \"The definition of random sequences\" that gave the first suitable definition of a random sequence.\nEarlier researchers such as Richard von Mises had attempted to formalize the notion of a test for randomness in order to define a random sequence as one that passed all tests for randomness; however, the precise notion of a randomness test was left vague. Martin-Löf's key insight was to use the theory of computation to define formally the notion of a test for randomness. This contrasts with the idea of randomness in probability; in that theory, no particular element of a sample space can be said to be random.\n\nMartin-Löf randomness has since been shown to admit many equivalent characterizations — in terms of compression, randomness tests, and gambling — that bear little outward resemblance to the original definition, but each of which satisfies our intuitive notion of properties that random sequences ought to have: random sequences should be incompressible, they should pass statistical tests for randomness, and it should be impossible to make money betting on them. The existence of these multiple definitions of Martin-Löf randomness, and the stability of these definitions under different models of computation, give evidence that Martin-Löf randomness is a fundamental property of mathematics and not an accident of Martin-Löf's particular model. The thesis that the definition of Martin-Löf randomness \"correctly\" captures the intuitive notion of randomness has been called the \"Martin-Löf-Chaitin Thesis\"; it is somewhat similar to the Church–Turing thesis.\n\nFollowing Martin-Löf's work, algorithmic information theory defines a random string as one that cannot be produced from any computer program that is shorter than the string (Chaitin–Kolmogorov randomness); i.e. a string whose Kolmogorov complexity is at least the length of the string. This is a different meaning from the usage of the term in statistics. Whereas statistical randomness refers to the \"process\" that produces the string (e.g. flipping a coin to produce each bit will randomly produce a string), algorithmic randomness refers to the \"string itself\". Algorithmic information theory separates random from nonrandom strings in a way that is relatively invariant to the model of computation being used.\n\nAn algorithmically random sequence is an \"infinite\" sequence of characters, all of whose prefixes (except possibly a finite number of exceptions) are strings that are \"close to\" algorithmically random (their length is within a constant of their Kolmogorov complexity).\n\nPer Martin-Löf has done important research in mathematical statistics, which (in the Swedish tradition) includes probability theory and statistics.\n\nPer Martin-Löf began bird watching in his youth and remains an enthusiastic bird-watcher. As a teenager, he published an article on estimating the mortality rates of birds, using data from bird ringing, in a Swedish zoological journal: This paper was soon cited in leading international journals, and this paper continues to be cited.\n\nIn the biology and statistics of birds, there are several problems of missing data. Martin-Löf's first paper discussed the problem of estimating the mortality rates of the Dunlin species, using capture-recapture methods. A second problem of missing data arises with studying the sex of birds. The problem of determining the biological sex of a bird, which is extremely difficult for humans, is one of the first examples in Martin-Löf's lectures on statistical models.\n\nMartin-Löf wrote a licenciate thesis on probability on algebraic structures, particularly semigroups, a research program led by Ulf Grenander at Stockholm University.\n\nMartin-Löf developed innovative approaches to statistical theory. In his paper \"On Tables of Random Numbers\", Kolmogorov observed that the frequency probability notion of the limiting properties of infinite sequences failed to provide a foundation for statistics, which considers only finite samples. Much of Martin-Löf's work in statistics was to provide a finite-sample foundation for statistics.\n\nIn the 1970s, Per Martin-Löf made important contributions to statistical theory and inspired further research, especially by Scandinavian statisticians including Rolf Sundberg, Thomas Höglund, and Steffan Lauritzen. In this work, Martin-Löf's previous research on probability measures on semigroups led to a notion of \"repetitive structure\" and a novel treatment of sufficient statistics, in which one-parameter exponential families were characterized. He provided a category-theoretic approach to nested statistical models, using finite-sample principles. Before (and after) Martin-Löf, such nested models have often been tested using chi-square hypothesis tests, whose justifications are only asymptotic (and so irrelevant to real problems, which always have finite samples).\n\nMartin-Löf's student, Rolf Sundberg, developed a detailed analysis of the expectation-maximization (EM) method for estimation using data from exponential families, especially with missing data. Sundberg credits a formula, later known as the Sundberg formula, to previous manuscripts of the Martin-Löf brothers, Per and Anders. Many of these results reached the international scientific community through the 1976 paper on the expectation maximization (EM) method by Arthur P. Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin, which was published in a leading international journal, sponsored by the Royal Statistical Society.\n\nIn philosophical logic, Per Martin-Löf has published papers on the theory of logical consequence, on judgments, etc. He has been interested in Central-European philosophical traditions, especially of the German-language writings of Franz Brentano, Gottlob Frege, and of Edmund Husserl.\n\nMartin-Löf has worked in mathematical logic for many decades.\n\nFrom 1968 to '69 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago where he met William Alvin Howard with whom he discussed issues related to the Curry–Howard correspondence. Martin-Löf's first draft article on type theory dates back to 1971. This impredicative theory generalized Girard's System F. However, this system turned out to be inconsistent due to Girard's paradox which was discovered by Girard when studying System U, an inconsistent extension of System F. This experience led Per Martin-Löf to develop the philosophical foundations of type theory, his \"meaning explanation\", a form of proof-theoretic semantics, which justifies predicative type theory as presented in his 1984 Bibliopolis book, and extended in a number of increasingly philosophical texts, such as his influential \"On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws\".\n\nThe 1984 type theory was extensional while the type theory presented in the book by Nordström \"et al.\" in 1990, which was heavily influenced by his later ideas, intensional, and more amenable to being implemented on a computer.\n\nMartin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory developed the notion of dependent types and directly influenced the development of the calculus of constructions and the logical framework LF. A number of popular computer-based proof systems are based on type theory, for example NuPRL, LEGO, Coq, ALF, Agda, Twelf, Epigram and Idris.\n\nMartin-Löf is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and of the Academia Europaea.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925768", "title": "Elisa Bonaparte", "text": "Elisa Bonaparte\n\nMaria Anna (Marie Anne) Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi Levoy (3 January 1777 – 7 August 1820), \"Princesse Française\", was an Italian ruler, Princess of Lucca and Piombino (1805-1814), Princess of Lucca (1805-1814), Grand Duchess of Tuscany (1809-1814) and Countess of Compignano by appointment of her brother Napoleon Bonaparte. \n\nShe was the fourth surviving child and eldest surviving daughter of Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino. A younger sister of Napoleon Bonaparte, she had elder brothers Joseph and Lucien, and younger siblings Louis, Pauline, Caroline and Jerome.\n\nAs Princess of Lucca and Piombino, then Grand Duchess of Tuscany, she became Napoleon's only sister to possess political power. Their relations were sometimes strained due to her sharp tongue. Highly interested in the arts, particularly the theatre, she encouraged them in the territories over which she ruled.\n\nÉlisa was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. She was christened \"Maria-Anna\", but later officially adopted the nickname \"Élisa\" (her brother Lucien, to whom she was very close in childhood, nicknamed her Elisa). In June 1784, a bursary allowed her to attend the Maison royale de Saint-Louis at Saint-Cyr, where she was frequently visited by her brother Napoleon. Following the French Revolution, the Legislative Assembly decreed the Maison's closure on 16 August 1792 as it shut down institutions associated with the aristocracy. Élisa left on 1 September with Napoleon to return to Ajaccio.\n\nAround 1795, the Bonaparte family relocated to Marseille. There Élisa got to know Felice Pasquale Baciocchi (who later adopted the surname Levoy). A Corsican nobleman and formerly a captain in the Royal Corse, he had been dismissed from his rank with the outbreak of the French Revolution.\n\nÉlisa married Levoy in a civil ceremony in Marseille on 1 August 1797, followed by a religious ceremony in Mombello, where Napoleon had a villa. He had moved there with his family in June 1797. Concerned about Baciocchi's reputation as a poor captain, Napoleon had some initial reservations about his sister's choice of spouse. Their religious ceremony was held on the same day as her sister Pauline's marriage to general Victor-Emmanuel Leclerc.\n\nIn July, Baciocchi was promoted to Chef de bataillon, with the command of the citadel at Ajaccio. In 1799, the extended Bonaparte family moved to Paris. Élisa set up home at 125 rue de Miromesnil, in the Quartier du Roule, where she held receptions and put on plays.\n\nDuring the rise of the Consulate, she and her brother Lucien held an artistic and literary salon at the Hôtel de Brissac, at which she met the journalist Louis de Fontanes, with whom she had a deep friendship for several years. On 14 May 1800, on the death of Lucien's first wife, Christine Boyer, Élisa took Lucien's two daughters under her protection. She placed Charlotte, the eldest, in Madame Campan's boarding school for young women at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\n\nAt the start of November 1800, Lucien was reassigned from his job as Minister of the Interior to Madrid as French ambassador to the court of the King of Spain. He took Élisa's husband, Félix Baciocchi, as his secretary. Élisa remained in Paris, but maintained a regular correspondence with her brother.\n\nOn 18 May 1804, the French Senate voted in favour of setting up the First French Empire, and Élisa and Napoleon's other sisters were established as members of the Imperial family, both taking the style \"\"Imperial Highness\"\" (\"Altesse impériale\"). Felice Baciocchi was promoted to général de brigade and later made a senator.\n\nHer separation from her husband in 1805 was seen favorably by Napoleon (though he soon rejoined her after her promotion to Lucca). On 19 March 1805, Napoleon awarded her the Principality of Piombino, which had been French property for some years and was of major strategic interest to Napoleon due to its proximity to Elba and Corsica. Felice and Élisa took the titles Prince and Princess of Piombino. In June 1805, the oligarchic Republic of Lucca, which had been occupied by France since late 1799, was made a principality and added to Felice and Élisa's domain, their entry into Lucca and investiture ceremony following on 14 July 1805.\n\nNapoleon had contemptuously called Lucca the \"dwarf republic\", due to its small size in terms of territory, but despite this it was a bulwark of political, religious, and commercial independence. Most of the power over Lucca and Piombino was exercised by Élisa, with Félix taking only a minor role and contenting himself with making military decisions. The inhabitants of Lucca, under French occupation and begrudging the loss of their independence, knew Élisa ironically as \"la Madame\" and had little sympathy for Napoleon, Élisa, or their attempts to \"Frenchify\" the republic.\n\nVery active and concerned with administering the area, Élisa was surrounded at Lucca by ministers who largely remained in place right to the end of her reign. These ministers included her Minister of Justice, Luigi Matteucci, her Minister of the Interior and Foreign Affairs, Francesco Belluomini (replaced in October 1807 by his son Giuseppe), her finance ministers, Jean-Baptiste Froussard (head of the cabinet) and, later, Pierre d'Hautmesnil (with the budget portfolio). She also set up a court and court etiquette inspired by those at the Tuileries.\n\nOn 31 March 1806 Napoleon withdrew Massa and Carrara from the Kingdom of Italy to add to Élisa's possessions. Carrara was one of the biggest white marble suppliers in Europe and Élisa bolstered her prestige by establishing an Académie des Beaux-Arts, designed to host the greatest sculptors and thus make Carrara an exporter of marble statues, which had a greater value than the raw marble. She also set up the Banque Élisienne to give financial aid to sculptors and workers on marble taxes. She reformed the clergy at Lucca and Piombino from May 1806, during which reforms she nationalised their goods and lands and closed down convents which did not also function as hotels or schools. She also carried out legislative reform in Lucca, producing laws inspired by the Code Napoleon (such as the notable \"Codice rurale del Principato di Piombino\", issued on 24 March 1808) and producing a new penal code which was promulgated in 1807 and first reformed in 1810.\n\nIn 1807 she set up the \"Committee of Public Charity\" for distributing charity funds, made up of clergy and lay-people, and also instituted free medical consultations for the poor so as to eradicate the diseases then ravaging Lucca's population. She demolished Piombino's hospital to build a new one in the former monastery of Sant' Anastasia, with the new building opening in 1810, and also set up the \"Casa Sanitaria\", a dispensary in the town's port. On 5 May 1807, decreed the established of the \"Committee for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts and Commerce\" to encourage and finance the invention of new machines and new techniques to increase the territories' agricultural production and experimental plantations such as those of mulberries at Massa, where an École Normale de la Soie (Silk School) was created on 16 August 1808.\n\nÉlisa also set up many teaching establishments in Lucca and, in 1809, a \"Direction Générale de l'Instruction Publique\" (General Department of Public Education). On 1 December 1807 she set up the \"Collège Félix\", the only boys' secondary school in the principality. For girls, she began by fixing set curricula for convents that also operated as schools, then set up a body of \"dames d'inspection\" to verify that these curricula were being adhered to. Teaching of girls aged 5 to 8 was made compulsory, though the laws were not always well applied. On 2 July 1807, Élisa founded the \"Institut Élisa\" within the limits of a former convent for noble-born girls, to produce well-educated and cultivated future wives. On 29 July 1812, Élisa set up an establishment for young poor girls, the \"Congregazione San Felice\", though this did not long outlive Élisa's fall.\n\nAs with Napoleon, Élisa set up city improvement works in her territories, mainly to expand the princely palaces. These works were hotly contested, especially in Lucca, where the expansion of the princely palaces necessitated the demolition of the Church of San Pietro in March 1807. She also razed an entire block in Lucca to build a piazza in the French style in front of her city residence (now the seat of the province and the prefecture). That block had included the Church of San Paolo with the venerated image of the \"Madonna dei miracoli\" and so its demolition seriously affected the city's medieval architecture and almost sparked a revolt.\n\nAt Massa, she demolished a cathedral on 30 April 1807. The palace at Lucca was fully redecorated and the gardens improved, with the creation of a botanical garden with a menagerie and aviary in 1811. She also began road construction, notably the \"route Friedland\" to link Massa and Carrara, with work beginning on 15 August 1807 but becoming delayed and only completed in 1820. Lucca's status as a spa town was also bolstered by her improvement of the architecture and decor of the town's baths. She began construction of an aqueduct into Lucca in 1811, but this too was only completed after her fall.\n\nOn 21 March 1801, Lucien Bonaparte and the King of Spain signed the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, which restored Louisiana to France and in exchange established the Kingdom of Etruria by dividing Tuscany. The new kingdom was initially put in the charge of the infante Maria Louisa and her husband, Louis of Etruria, but he soon proved to be a poor ruler and deceased soon after in 1803. Thus, on 29 October 1807, Napoleon signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau with the Spanish court. This transferred Tuscany to France, and, in November of that year, Marie-Louise left the kingdom. From 12 May 1808, Tuscany was entrusted to an intermediary governor, Abdallah Jacques Menou, a French soldier who had converted to Islam during Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, but his way of life and lack of interest in the territory's affairs forced Napoleon to recall him on 5 April 1809. Élisa wished to become Governess of Tuscany in 1808, but she contracted an illness late in the year that prevented her from taking part in state affairs. She recovered in February 1809. A decree was officially created between the second and third of March that year which established the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, made Florence its capital and Élisa its grand duchess. However, the terms of the decree required Élisa to enforce the decisions of Napoleon and his ministers and denied her the power to modify any of these decisions. This was a significant difference compared to the relative autonomy Élisa enjoyed in Lucca and Piombino. The decree also promoted Félix to the rank of général de division.\n\nOn 2 April 1809, Élisa arrived in Florence, where she was coldly received by the nobility. Her arrival coincided with a revolt against compulsory conscription that ended after a mayor and a judge were assassinated. The conscription and many new taxes imposed on Tuscany by Napoleon were sources of conflicts in the region. As at Lucca, Élisa tried to nationalise the goods of the clergy and closed many convents. \n\nShe continued her patronage of arts and science. In 1809, she commissioned the sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini to create busts of her immediate family. The first two volumes of the \"Annali del Museo Imperiale di Fisica e Storia Naturale\" of Florence were dedicated to her, in 1808 and 1809. The observatory at that museum of physics and natural history was the ancestor of Florence's present-day Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri.\n\nÉlisa later became unwillingly involved in Napoleon's removal of Pope Pius VII. Pius opposed the Empire's annexation of the Papal States, and he refused to renounce his temporal powers. Pius then excommunicated Napoleon in the bull \"Quum memoranda\" on 10 June 1809. In response to this intransigence, Napoleon selected a general, Étienne Radet, to remove the pope and eliminate a figure that could rally opposition against the Empire and his regime. The removal occurred on the night of 6 July 1809, and in the pope traveled toward Savona in the days following his ouster. The pope passed by Florence where Élisa did not welcome him in person and also asked Pius to leave the region soon as possible, so as not to displease her brother by being seen as welcoming his enemy.\n\nÉlisa's relations with Napoleon became increasingly strained. Napoleon frequently recalled Élisa for any irregularity in her execution of his orders in Tuscany. On 17 March 1810, Élisa arrived in Paris for Napoleon's marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria, but Napoleon took advantage of her visit to reclaim the payments from his grants of Massa and Carrara. When Élisa returned to Tuscany, she found Napoleon still sought to claim payment of these grants via his envoys. Élisa refused to pay a second time, arguing that the territories had too few resources to pay Napoleon's demanded 200,000 lira. Napoleon threatened to seize Carrara from Élisa and also demanded Lucca raise men by conscription. Lucca was previously spared this burden prior to May 1811, and Napoleon's demands eroded Élisa support in Lucca. Élisa returned to Lucca from Florence and restored the villa now known as the Villa Reale di Marlia, despite the cold reception of the local community.\n\nIn 1813, with Napoleon facing the allied coalition after his Russian campaign, Caroline Bonaparte's husband Joachim Murat, King of Naples, abandoned his brother-in-law and joined the Austrian cause by leading the Neapolitan to Rome. Élisa was forced to abdicate as Grand Duchess of Tuscany in favor of Grand Duke Ferdinand III's restoration and leave Tuscany for Lucca. The Neapolitans captured Massa and Carrara in March. An Anglo-Austrian force under Lord William Bentinck captured Lucca soon after, forcing the pregnant Élisa to flee on the night of 13 March 1814. Élisa made several short stays in Italy and France, notably seeking support in Marseille to return to Italy as a private individual. The former duchess' requests were denied, but she was able to stay in Austria for a time thanks to the efforts of her brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, before moving to the Villa Caprara in Trieste.\n\nNapoleon was exiled to Elba on 13 April 1814 under the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and Élisa was arrested on 25 March (??) and interned in the Austrian fortress of Brünn. She was freed at the end of August and authorized to stay in Trieste with the title of Countess of Compignano. Élisa acquired a country house at Villa Vicentina near Cervignano after her release and financed several archaeological digs in the region. She contracted a fatal illness in June 1820, probably at an excavation site, and died on 7 August at the age of 43. Élisa became the only adult sibling of Napoleon Bonaparte not to survive the emperor. She was buried in the San Petronio Basilica of Bologna.\n\nShe married Felice Pasquale Baciocchi Levoy, a member of Corsican nobility, on 1 May 1797, created Prince Français, Duke of Lucca and Prince of Piombino and Prince of Massa-Carrara and La Garfagnana. They were parents of four children:\n"}
{"id": "1925784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925784", "title": "Charilaos Florakis", "text": "Charilaos Florakis\n\nCharilaos Florakis (also Harilaos Florakis; ; 20 July 1914 – 22 May 2005) was a leader of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). He is best known for establishing the dominance of the KKE over other left-wing elements, and for his flexibility and forming alliances with the conservatives.\n\nFlorakis was born on 20 July 1914 in the village of Paliozoglopi, located near Agrafa in the Itamos municipality, in the Karditsa Prefecture, Greece. He joined the Communist Party of Greece in 1941. An EAM-ELAS partisan during the resistance to the Nazi occupation in World War II, Florakis was on the losing side of the Greek Civil War that followed the liberation of the country, and subsequently left the country.\n\nOn his return to Greece in 1954 he was arrested. During his life he spent 18 years in detention or jail - including being put in internal exile by the Greek colonels in the beginning of the 1967-74 military dictatorship.\n\nFirst elected to parliament in 1974 after the \"Metapolitefsi\", Florakis led KKE as its general secretary from 1972 until 1989, when, though still fit for the job, he announced his decision to step down from the party's top post and proposed Grigoris Farakos as his successor.\n\nFlorakis did not retire from politics, however. In the same year he retired from the leadership of the KKE, he was approved as the president of the newly founded Synaspismos or Coalition of the Left. Synaspismos was an attempt to reconcile Greece's two main communist factions, which arose in 1968 out of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring. That show of brute strength led many Greek communists to break with the Moscow-oriented KKE and to join one of the factions that emerged.\n\nSynaspismos was created partly at the instigation of Florakis, and drew members from both the KKE and the KKE-Interior Eurocommunists. It also became an umbrella for other leftist groups and disaffected supporters of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Andreas Papandreou, which lost the general election in 1989.\n\nIn 1991, as it became increasingly clear that Soviet communism would not last, a rift arose within the KKE between those who supported continuing efforts towards a reconciliation with the Euro-communists through Synaspismos, and orthodox communists who felt that communism was threatened internationally and favoured a return to ideological roots. Florakis sided with the latter and at the 13th KKE conference in early 1991 —even before the fall of Mikhail Gorbachev and the dissolution of the Soviet Union— the party officially withdrew all support from Synaspismos and Florakis was elected honorary president of the KKE.\n\nFlorakis died of heart failure at his home in Athens on 22 May 2005. Florakis' body lay in state at the KKE headquarters in Perissos on May 24–25 where thousands of party members and sympathisers queued to pay their respects.

{"id": "1925787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925787", "title": "Culture of Kazakhstan", "text": "Culture of Kazakhstan\n\nKazakhstan has a well-articulated culture based on the nomadic pastoral economy of the inhabitants. Islam was introduced to Kazakhstan in the 7th to 12th centuries. Besides lamb, many other traditional foods retain symbolic value in Kazakh culture. Kazakh culture is largely influenced by the Turkic nomadic lifestyle. Kazakh culture seems also to be strongly influenced by the nomadic Scythians. \n\nBecause animal husbandry was central to the Kazakhs' traditional lifestyle, most of their nomadic practices and customs relate in some way to livestock. Traditional curses and blessings invoked disease or fecundity among animals, and good manners required that a person ask first about the health of a man's livestock when greeting him and only afterward inquire about the human aspects of his life.\n\nThe traditional Kazakh dwelling is the \"yurt\", a tent consisting of a flexible framework of willow wood covered with varying thicknesses of felt. The open top permits smoke from the central hearth to escape; temperature and draft can be controlled by a flap that increases or decreases the size of the opening. A properly constructed yurt can be cooled in summer and warmed in winter, and it can be disassembled or set up in less than an hour. The interior of the yurt has ritual significance; the right side is generally reserved for men and the left for women. Yurts are also frequently used as a decorative motif in restaurants and other public buildings.\n\nToday's Kazakhstan is a modern culture, thriving in the post-Soviet era. The traditional Kazakh lifestyle has blended with influences from Western societies, as well as those from Kazakhstan's Russian and Chinese neighbors.\n\nIslam is the largest religion in Kazakhstan, followed by Russian Orthodox Christianity. By tradition the Kazakhs are Sunni Muslims, and the Russians are Russian Orthodox. Approximately 70% of the population is Muslim. The majority are Sunni of the Hanafi school, including ethnic Kazakhs, who constitute about 60% of the population, as well as by ethnic Uzbeks, Uighurs, and Tatars. Less than 25% of the population is Russian Orthodox, including ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. Other religious groups include Judaism, the Bahá'í Faith, Hare Krishnas, Buddhism, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nTraditional Kazakh cuisine revolves around lamb and horse meat, as well as a variety of dairy milk products. For hundreds of years, Kazakhs were herders who raised fat-tailed sheep, Bactrian camels, and horses, relying on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food. The cooking techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's nomadic way of life. For example, most cooking techniques are aimed at long-term preservation of food. There is a large practice of salting and drying meat so that it will last, and there is a preference for sour milk, as it is easier to save in a nomadic lifestyle. \n\nIn recent years, there has been an influx of young westernised Kazakh chefs into the heart of Nur-Sultan, including the now famous Rania Ahmed who spent her early years training in West London’s Michelin Star restaurants. This has resulted in a new breed of cuisine which blends traditional savoury Kazakh dishes with European fast food, such as \"betinjantabs\", proving very popular with younger generations.\n\n\"Besbarmak\", a dish consisting of boiled horse or lamb meat, is the most popular Kazakh dish. Besbarmak is usually eaten with a boiled pasta sheet, and a meat broth called \"shorpa\", and is traditionally served in Kazakh bowls called \"kese\". Other popular meat dishes are \"kazy\" (which is a horse meat sausage that only the wealthy could afford), \"shuzhuk\" (horse meat sausages), \"kuyrdak\" (also spelled \"kuirdak\", a dish made from roasted horse, sheep, or cow offal, such as heart, liver, kidneys, and other organs, diced and served with onions and peppers), and various horse delicacies, such as \"zhal\" (smoked lard from horse's neck) and \"zhaya\" (salted and smoked meat from horse's hip and hind leg). Pilaf (\"palaw\") is the most common Kazakh rice dish, with vegetables (carrots, onions, and/or garlic) and chunks of meat. The national drinks are \"kumys\" (fermented mare's milk) and tea.\n\nKazakhs are known for their hospitality, and so many Kazakh traditions are based on this ethnic feature. Some traditions have been lost, but some have been rediscovered. Below are some of the traditions that continue to play a role in the modern Kazakh society: \n\nKonakasy (Kazakh: қонақасы; \"konak\" - guest, \"as\" - food) - a tradition to welcome a guest and make his stay as enjoyable as one can by providing food, lodge, entertainment. Depending on the circumstances under which a guest had come from, he is either called \"arnayy konak\" (Kazakh: арнайы қонақ) - a specially invited guest, \"kudayy konak\" (Kazakh: құдайы қонақ) - a casual traveller, or \"kydyrma konak\" (Kazakh: қыдырма қонақ) - an unexpected visitor. \n\nKorimdik (Kazakh: көрімдік; \"koru\" - to see) - a tradition of presenting a person with a gift to congratulate him on a gain in his life. The custom is called \"korimdik\", if a gain is related to a person or an animal (e.g. seeing a person's daughter-in-law or a newborn animal for the first time), and \"baygazy\" (Kazakh: байғазы), if the gain is material. \n\nShashu (Kazakh: шашу - to scatter) - a tradition to shower heroes of an occasion with sweets during some festivity. Kazakhs believe that collected delights bring luck. \n\nBata (Kazakh: бата - blessing) - a form of poetic art, typically given by the most respected or the eldest person to express gratitude for the provided hospitality, give blessing to a person who is about to enter a new phase in life, go through a challenging experience or travel. \n\nTusau kesu (Kazakh: тұсау кесу - to cut ties) - a tradition to celebrate the first attempts of a child to walk. The legs of a child are tied with a string of white and black colors symbolizing the good and the bad in life. The tie is then cut by a female relative who is energetic and lively in nature, so that the child acquires her qualities. After the string has been cut, it is burnt. \n\nKyz uzatu (Kazakh: қыз ұзату) - the first wedding party organized by the parents of a bride. The literal translation is \"to see off a daughter\". \n\nBetashar (Kazakh: беташар; \"bet\" - face, \"ashu\" - to open) - the custom (often done at the wedding) to lift a veil from the face of a bride. Today it is mullah who is invited to perform an improvised song, in which he mentions relatives of the groom. During his performance, a bride has to bow every time she hears a name. After the song, a mother of the groom lifts the veil. \n\nShildehana (Kazakh: шілдехана) - celebration of a birth of a child. \n\nSuinshi (Kazakh: сүйінші) - a tradition to give present to someone who has brought good news. \n\nThe official language is Kazakh, a Turkic language closely related to Nogai and Karakalpak. Another widely spoken language is Russian. The recent language policy suggests trilingualism as an important factor for future development of the country. \n\nAbay Qunanbayuli was a great Kazakh poet, composer and philosopher.\n\nEach year Kazakh artisans participate in the “Sheber” competition. The competition is part of the program \"Development of crafts and the revival of folk arts and crafts in Kazakhstan\", which began in 2006 to increase the competitiveness of Kazakh artisans’ products domestically and internationally. This program is conducted by the Union of Artisans of Kazakhstan, “Chevron,” the Eurasia Foundation of Central Asia, Kazakh Ministry of Culture and Information and the UNESCO Cluster Office in Almaty.\n\nIn September 2006, the government announced that it is funding distribution of a multimillion-dollar movie called \"Nomad\", about the new-created by Kazakhstan government history of the nation. The movie started in 2003, and has been plagued with multiple development problems, finally released in 2006.\n\nSince that time such movies like \"Mongol\", \"Tulpan\", and \"Kelin\" have been released. All three films were submitted for the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Languages Film. The movie 'Tulpan' won the Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. The speechless movie \"Kelin\" made the shortlist of the 82.Academy Awards.\n\nMagic Songs of the Eternal Steppe is a series of concerts at Carnegie Hall and The Kennedy Center in celebration of Kazakhstan Cultural Days in the United States. The concerts feature Kazakh folk music and Western classic masterpieces as well as American songs performed by the Kazakh National Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, Kazakh National Baikadamov Choir and a group of Kazakh soloists. \n\nSymphony Orchestra of the Kurmangazy Kazakh National Conservatory was founded in 1947. The first leader of the orchestra was Professor K. Babayev. The Orchestra has a vast repertoire spanning Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Lizst, Saint-Saens, Bizet, Ravel, Frank, Mahler, Orf, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Musorgsky, Shostakovich, and many others.\n\nKazakhstan has cultivated a strong interest in sports, physical education, and extracurricular activities. Kazakhstan has achieved some success in international competitions in weightlifting, ice hockey, and boxing. Kazakhstan won eight medals in the 2004 Summer Olympics, the largest tally for any nation in Central Asia.\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Kazakhstan. The Football Federation of Kazakhstan (FFK) is the sport's national governing body. The FFK organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams. The Kazakhstan Super League is the top-level competition for the sport in the country.\n\nCycling is Kazakhstan's most successful sport. A lot of professional cyclists that compete on the European circuit come from Kazakhstan. Most notable is Alexander Vinokourov, whose achievements include two Paris–Nice's, third place in the 2003 Tour de France, and the Amstel Gold Race. Vinokourov leads which is supported by a coalition of Kazakh companies. This team is registered as a UCI ProTeam and competes in major races, including the Tour de France.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport in Kazakhstan, with over 10,000 fans consistently turning up to watch the Kazakhstan national rugby union team play. Recent big wins over Sri Lanka and the Arabian Gulf Rugby Team have given the Kazakhstan side the reason to believe that they could have been contenders to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Kazakhstan has yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup tournament.\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined six specific projects designed to start the spiritual modernisation of Kazakhstan in his keynote article “Course towards the Future: Modernisation of Kazakhstan's Identity,\" which was released in April 2017. The projects include the following:\n\nThe program also includes translation of the contemporary Kazakh literature and poetry into the UN's six languages. The official presentation of the Anthology took place in Almaty in April 2019.\n\nThe presentation of the Anthology translated into English was held at the British Library in London on September 25, 2019. The Cambridge University Press along with the British literary translation experts translated and published the Kazakh literature collections in English.\n\nAn important part of the program is the Seven Facets of the Great Steppe doctrine, which described by President Nazarbayev. The article described the seven facets of the Great Steppe: culture of horsemanship, ancient metallurgy of the great steppe, animal style, Golden Man, cradle of the Turkic world, the Great Silk Road and the land of apples and tulips.\n\n\n\n"}

(trade name: Guerrilla Games) is a Dutch video game developer based in Amsterdam. The company was founded as Lost Boys Games in January 2000 through the merger of three smaller development studios as a subsidiary of multimedia conglomerate company Lost Boys. Lost Boys Games became independent the following year and was acquired by Media Republic in 2003, which renamed the studio Guerrilla Games and sold it to Sony Computer Entertainment in 2005. The company employs approximately 250 people under the leadership of joint studio heads Angie Smets, Jan-Bart van Beek, and Michiel van der Leeuw. It is best known for the \"Killzone\" game series and \"Horizon Zero Dawn\".\n\nGuerrilla is the result of a merger between three Dutch video game studios: Orange Games, Digital Infinity, and Formula Game Development. Orange Games was founded in 1993 by Arjan Brussee, the co-designer of the 1994 game \"Jazz Jackrabbit\"; Digital Infinity was founded by Arnout van der Kamp in 1995; and Formula was founded by Martin de Ronde in 1998 and sold to Lost Boys (a multimedia conglomerate company owned by Michiel Mol) in 1999. The three studios merged, forming Lost Boys Games as a subsidiary of Lost Boys on 1 January 2000. With de Ronde as managing director, the new company employed 25 people, growing to 40 by November 2000. Hermen Hulst was hired from a consulting firm to replace de Ronde as managing director the following year. In 2001, when Lost Boys merged with Swedish media company IconMediaLab, Lost Boys Games was spun off into an independent entity, though under the continued ownership of Mol.\n\nLost Boys Games began developing Game Boy Color games with original characters, however, the studio found that publishers would rather release games including licensed characters. Because the studio did not want to compromise on significantly altering the characters it had created, it was unable to find a publisher for them. Consequently, Lost Boys Games moved on to work-for-hire projects, creating four handheld games: \"Dizzy's Candy Quest\" (Game Boy Color, 2001), \"Rhino Rumble\" (Game Boy Color, 2002), \"Black Belt Challenge\" (Game Boy Advance, 2002), and \"Invader\" (Game Boy Advance, 2002). The latter two games were published by Xicat Interactive. Mol later established a new media company, Media Republic, which acquired 75% of Lost Boys Games in 2003. Shortly thereafter, in July 2003, Lost Boys Games was renamed Guerrilla to reflect the style of its new parent company.\n\nThe developer soon began work on its two titles: \"Killzone\" (in development for Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2) and \"\" (in development for Eidos Interactive for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows). Both titles would be released the following year to mixed reception, however \"Killzone\" enjoyed pre-release hype and anticipation, and despite some backfire effect due to the media hype, \"Killzone\" went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, earning Greatest Hits and Platinum status in North America and Europe respectively. Guerrilla signed an exclusive development agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment in March 2004, that would see future development solely for Sony's line of video game consoles, the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3.\n\nBy late 2005, many companies, like Eidos Interactive, eyed purchasing Guerrilla; ultimately, Sony Computer Entertainment bought out the entirety of Guerrilla in December 2005. Guerrilla went on to release \"\" for the PlayStation Portable in October 2006, \"Killzone 2\" for the PlayStation 3 in February 2009, and \"Killzone 3\" for the PlayStation 3 in February 2011.\n\nBy February 2012, co-founder Brussee had left the studio to join Visceral Games. As of June 2018, Guerrilla employs 250 people in its Amsterdam offices; it planned to move into a new building on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal in early 2019 and expand to at least 400 employees in this new location. In November 2019, Hulst was appointed the head of Worldwide Studios and Angie Smets, Jan-Bart van Beek and Michiel van der Leeuw became joint studio heads in his place.\n\nGuerrilla uses a proprietary game engine known as Decima.\n"}

He is also known as Syndrone and Tstewart. He is one half of Sepalcure, with Praveen Sharma, one half of Jets, with Jimmy Edgar, as well as half of Dream Continuum, with Jim Coles, a.k.a. Om Unit.\n\nTravis Stewart was born on March 4, 1982 in Eden, North Carolina. He was exposed to a wide range of musical influences in his childhood. His grandfather played pedal steel for a country band, and gave Stewart his first guitar. His first recordings were made at his grandparents' house, around the age of 5 or 6. His parents kept a house full of instruments, and a singer-songwriter cousin continually exposed him to new sounds and ideas. He fostered an interest with polyrhythms while playing marching snare in his high school band, and the djembe in an African ensemble. Stewart played in two local alternative bands, before turning more towards electronic music around the time of 8th grade. Using handed down computers, he began to produce his own music, and connected with a community of likeminded musicians over the internet. He started the Machinedrum project during his final two years of high school, between 1998 and 1999. After graduation, he attended Full Sail University in Florida to study audio engineering. In 2001, at the age of 19, he released his first record as Machinedrum, Now You Know, on Merck Records.\n\nFollowing college, Stewart moved to New York City and got involved with Brooklyn-based boutique label Normrex, and has since collaborated with such people as Tiombe Lockhart, Theophilus London, Jesse Boykins III, Azealia Banks, and Mickey Factz among others. For Theophilus London, Stewart produced the Jam Mixtape and mixed This Charming Mixtape. For Azealia Banks, he produced the tracks Barbie Shit, L8R, and Fantasea among others. From 2001–2010, Stewart is credited for having released 8 albums, 20 remixes, and numerous mixes, singles, and EPs.\n\nStewart's collaboration with Praveen Sharma, known as Sepalcure, began after the two had collaborated on parties Percussion Lab and Cassette NYC, then decided to record music together, which gained the attention of Hotflush records, who signed the duo. Pitchfork Magazine considered their self-titled LP one of 2011's Top 50 albums, and the song \"Pencil Pimp,\" made the list of 2011's Top 100 Tracks. In 2010, Stewart and Sharma wrote and performed the song \"Outside The Lines\" for the film Black Swan. Also in 2010, Stewart signed to LuckyMe records and released the Many Faces EP, followed by the \"Alarma\" single in 2011 and the SXLND EP in 2012. In 2011, Stewart released the album Room(s), on Planet Mu. The album was made mostly on the road, with Stewart limited to his laptop and headphones. In 2013, Stewart signed to Ninja Tune and announced his debut LP for the label, \"Vapor City, \"would be released later that year.\nHis single \"She Died There\" was featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto V on the fictional radio station \"FlyLo FM.\"\n\nAs a performer, Stewart has played such venues as the Sydney Opera House, the Nokia Theater in New York City, the Sonar Music Festival '11 and '12 in Barcelona, and SXSW.\n\nStewart currently resides in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925799", "title": "Bruce Seldon", "text": "Bruce Seldon\n\nBruce Samuel Seldon (born January 30, 1967) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 1996, and 2004 to 2009. He held the WBA heavyweight title from 1995 to 1996, most notably losing to Mike Tyson via knockout in his second defense.\n\nSeldon compiled an amateur record of 20 wins and 4 losses, and won the New Jersey Golden Gloves in the super heavyweight division.\n\nKnown as \"The Atlantic City Express\", Seldon began his career on October 4, 1988 with a first-round knockout of Joel McGraw and won his first 18 fights without a blemish. During his winning streak he defeated some notable boxers: Ezra Sellers (future world cruiserweight title challenger), Ossie Ocasio (former cruiserweight champion and heavyweight title challenger), David Bey (former world rated contender), and Jose Ribalta (former world title contender).\n\nOn April 18, 1991 future WBC heavyweight champion Oliver McCall handed Seldon his first defeat. Seldon was ahead on the scorecards but tired and was knocked down by McCall three times in the ninth. In his next fight Seldon was matched with future undisputed world heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe who defeated him.\n\nSeldon returned in 1992 with a victory over Jesse Ferguson whom he stopped on an eye injury, but was knocked down and outpointed the same year by ex-champion Tony Tubbs. Seldon signed with promoter Don King in 1993 and boxed on a series of his undercards, most notably in August 1993 when he stopped ex-champion Greg Page in nine rounds.\n\nIn 1995, world heavyweight champion George Foreman was stripped of the WBA title for declining to defend it against Tony Tucker. As Seldon was the second-ranked contender, a fight between him and Tucker was arranged for the vacant belt on April 8, 1995 in Las Vegas. Seldon, the underdog, used his jab to great effect and swelled Tucker's eye shut, to the point where the fight was stopped by the ringside doctor after seven rounds.\n\nOn August 18, 1995, Seldon fought on the undercard of the Mike Tyson-Peter McNeeley fight that marked Tyson's return to boxing. In the first defense of his title, Seldon again used his jab to control Joe Hipp and stop him in the tenth round.\n\nSeldon's next defense was scheduled against Tyson, who in early 1996 won the WBC title for a second time by knocking out Frank Bruno. The bout was originally to be a title unification fight, with both Seldon's WBA belt and Tyson's WBC belt at stake. However, the WBC mandated that Tyson defend his belt against former champion Lennox Lewis first. Since the fight with Seldon was already signed, Tyson vacated his belt and only Seldon's was on the line when the two fought on September 7, 1996.\n\nThe fight was marred by controversy as Seldon lost by knockout in the first round. His performance in the fight was vastly criticized, as he was knocked down twice on what appeared to be light or \"phantom\" punches from Tyson. Rumors started that Seldon had been paid to take a dive against Tyson, with the fans chanting \"fix\" following the decision. Although Seldon claimed in a post fight interview with Jim Gray that he did not take a dive, the criticism of his performance (including accusations that he took a dive) did not stop and Seldon elected to retire following the fight. The late rapper Tupac Shakur attended the fight on that night, and was shot on the journey home, leading to his death six days later.\n\nSeldon attempted a comeback at age 37 in 2004. He defeated two journeymen before gaining a high-profile fight on HBO with Gerald Nobles. Abandoning his jab and boxing style for a punch out, Seldon decked Nobles in the second and was ahead on points but ended up throwing in the towel due to an eye injury in the ninth. In his next bout, an overweight Seldon was stopped in two rounds by Tye Fields.\n\nSeldon launched a second comeback in 2007, now into his 40s, and knocked out a series of journeymen before being knocked out himself by ranked contenders Kevin Johnson and Fres Oquendo. He was also KO'd in four during an exhibition with Alexander Povetkin.\n\nSeldon is currently training his super middleweight son Isiah Seldon. While not officially 'retired', Seldon is more involved with his son's career at this time. Seldon's career record stands at 40 wins and 8 losses, with 36 knockouts.\n"}

The fortification was built in support of Sverre Sigurdsson's struggle against his rival King Magnus Erlingsson to claim the throne of Norway. \nThe site now forms part of the Sverresborg Trøndelag Folk Museum, an open-air museum for the region of Trøndelag.\nDefense of the city of Trondheim and the location of Sverresborg was based on three key topographical features:\n\nIn 1177, Sverre Sigurdsson, who would later rule as king of Norway from 1184-1202, led the rebel Birkebeiner (\"Birkebeinerne\") forces to Trøndelag where Sverre was hailed as king at Øretinget, the Thing (assembly) for Trøndelag. This was an important symbolic event as new Norwegian kings traditionally had been elected there. After this, the Birkebeins moved south and wintered in Østerdalen. The next spring, the Birkebeins returned to Trøndelag, attacking the city of Nidaros (now Trondheim). Defeated, they fled south until they met and beat the army of reigning King Magnus Erlingsson in Ringerike. Encouraged, the Birkebeins again moved north to Trøndelag and remained in Nidaros during the winter of 1178.\nDuring the spring of 1179, Magnus arrived with his army. The two armies met on June 19 in the (\"Slaget på Kalvskinnet\") with the result being a clear victory for Sverre, securing his grip on Trøndelag.\n\nMagnus Erlingsson again attacked Trøndelag in the spring of 1180. Sverre held Trøndelag from Nidaros, which was then protected by a wooden palisades extending from the river to the fjord across the neck of the peninsula connecting the town to the mainland. In the (\"Slaget på Ilevollene\"), just outside Nidaros, the Heklungs were again defeated.\n\nThe two forces met again in 1181 in the (\"Slaget i Bergen 1181\") which resulted in a minor victory for Sverre. But Magnus exploited Sverre’s absence from Trøndelag when in November he raided and burned the Birkebeiner fleet located there. Sverre was forced to return or risk losing his one secure foothold. During the summer of 1182, Magnus made an attempt to take Nidaros by siege, but was repulsed with grave losses when the Birkebeins launched a surprise night attack.\n\nIn the winter of 1182/1183 Sverre initiated construction of Sverresborg (one of the earliest Norwegian fortresses) to provide him a more secure and more easily defended base from which reside and operate from. The location selected was easily fortified, hard to approach, and could be defended by a small force. The stone for the fortification was available only 0.6 km away in the quarry which had been used for construction the cathedral at Nidaros. Since the Archbishop of Nidaros, who had aligned with King Magnus, was in exile in England from 1180 to 1183, the stonemasons were also available. Work proceeded quickly, and Sverre, along with a detachment of his men, moved out to the castle during Lent in 1183.\n\nThe sea Battle of Fimreite in 1184 proved to be final struggle between the Birkebeins and the ; King Magnus drowned. King Sverre, after a six years of struggle, became the uncontested king of Norway. But the peace was not to last for long.\n\nIn 1188 the town of Nidaros, which had been vacated by King Sverre’s men, was attacked. His opposition stormed into the city and a bloodbath followed. The wooden fortress was torn down and the castle burnt and left in ruins. It is not known precisely when it was restored, but the \"Sverris saga\" indicates the castle had been restored by 1197. King Sverre died in Bergen on 8 March 1202. Sverresborg is last mentioned in the time of King Sverre’s paternal grandson, King Haakon Haakonson in 1263, when he allowed the walls of Sverresborg to be broken down.\n\nIn 1914 the area surrounding the ruins of King Sverre's medieval castle was appropriated for the site of the new open-air museum. Today the castle ruins are adjoining the Sverresborg Trøndelag Folk Museum. The museum had started in 1909, when a group of enthusiasts decided to gather buildings and objects characteristic of the area for purposes of preservation. The area around the fortress ruins was set aside for purposes of building a museum and the collection has grown steadily since then. Sverresborg Trøndelag Folk Museum is one of the largest cultural history museums in Norway. There are more than 60 buildings on the site now, covering a broad ethnological range.\n\n\n\n"}

Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the Dio-Olympos municipality, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It is located at the base of Mount Olympus, on the western shore of the Thermaic Gulf. The first recorded mention of Litochoro is in an account of a visit by Saint Dionysius (Greek: Άγιος Διονύσιος) to Mount Olympus in the 16th century. The town is a popular destination for those wishing to climb Mount Olympus as almost all climbing routes begin to the southwest of the town. A famous son of the town was Christos Kakkalos, who ascended first Mount Olympos in 1913.\n\nLitochoro is located 22 km S of Katerini, 90 km SSW of Thessaloniki, 58 km N of Larissa and 420 km WNW of Athens, on the eastern slopes of Mount Olympus, of mythological fame as the home of the twelve gods of Olympus. Two important ancient sites are located in the neighbourhood of Litochoro. Dion with its large archaeological park and a museum is located about 8 km to the north. Leivithra with its acropolis and the Leivithra Park is about 9 km to the south. The municipal unit has an area of 169.632 km.\nPine, cedar and fir trees of the forests of Mount Olympus lie to the southwest and northwest. Much of the land around Litochoro, in particular to the South, remains uncultivated. Farmland is predominant to the North. Litochoro has several restaurants and cafeterias.\n\nLitochoro has schools, banks, a post office, a harbour, a sports centre, a town hall, a hospital, a museum, a concert hall, a gym, shopping facilities and squares. There are two main churches: Agios Nikolaos in the centre and Agios Dimitrios in the North. Litochoro has one of the most traditional cemeteries of Greece, known as \"Agios Athanasios\", in the north of the town.\nOlympus National Park Information Center\n\nImportant information is provided here for visitors of Mount Olympus National Park. The Information Center informs their visitors about the geology, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus.\n\nAlexandrion (Litochoro)\n\nLocated beside the highway (GR-1/E75), the Alexandreion is an impressive monument-building devoted to Alexander the Great. Visitors will get informed about his life and his military campaign.\n\nThe Nautical Museum\n\nAt Agios Nikolaou 15, on the first floor, resides the Nautical Museum of Litochoro. Rather unknown, the village has a long maritime history to tell.\n\nThe old Monastery Agios Dionysios\n\nAt an altitude of 850 m, beside the Enipeas gorge, Saint Dionysios built a monastery. Founded 1542, its name was Agia Triada, what means Holy Trinity, later changed to the name of the Saint. Plundered and burned several times in its history, it received the final blow from German troops in April 1943.\n\nThe new Monastery Agios Dionysios\n\nAfter the old monastery was destroyed, the monks moved to the Metochion three kilometers outside of the village and made the place their new monastery.\n\nAn extended coastal area known as Pláka or Pláka Litochorou (Πλάκα Λιτοχώρου) is located east of the town of Litochoro, spreading from the foot of Olympus to the Thermaic Gulf and extending from Leptokarya in the south to Gritsa in the north. The E75 highway passes through the area of Plaka to the south of Litochoro. The coast mainly consists of sandy beaches with seaside resorts as well as hotels, campsites, restaurants, and beach bars (which mostly operate during the summer season from June to September). In the area of Plaka there are private residences, luxurious villas, and cottages.\n\nNorth-east of Litochoro (North from Pláka) the coastal area continues, known by the name Gritsa or Limenas Litochorou extending from Pláka in the south to the community of Variko in the north. Sandy beaches can be also found here but the tourist facilities are much less than Pláka's. Yet here are some cottages and a luxury hotel (Dion resort). Gritsa is also the port of Litochoro, even though its capacity is restricted.\n\nSince the 1960s Litochoro has been served by an interchange with GR-1/E75 to its east. In the mid-1990s, parts of the Greek national road from Athens to Thessaloniki were upgraded to motorway standard. Litochoro is on the Northern stretch of this 6 lane dual carriageway, 90 km from Thessaloniki. Its nearest beach is 5 km to the east. <br>\nThere is a regular bus service to Katerini and a local train service (one train approximately every two hours in each direction) to Thessaloniki and Larissa, where there is an interchange with the main line to Athens. Because Litochoro railway station is about 6 km away from Litochoro and 1 km from the nearest bus stop, people wishing to take the train often take the bus to Katerini and take the train from there. Taxis are to be found in abundance.\n\n\n"}

This hang-glider was a major achievement for the time, when many engineers still struggled with the development of \"heavier-than-air\" non-powered aircraft. He also displayed rubber band powered flying models called the 'Aeroveloce' in 1877 and 1880. \n\nDuring the turn of the century he was one of the world-wide contestants for the creation of a break-through powered airplane. In 1900 he developed the control stick for aircraft, but did not apply for a patent (instead, a patent was awarded to the French aviator, Robert Esnault-Pelterie who applied for it in 1907). Kress' aircraft, the Drachenflieger, was constructed for water takeoff and achieved some brief hops in 1901 at the Wienerwaldsee near Vienna.\n\nA longer controlled flight was not possible because the engine (made by Daimler) was twice as heavy as Kress had specified in his order, and could be operated only at half of its nominal power output. During one of his attempts at flight taking off from water, his plane was destroyed when it became entangled on debris floating in the lake.\n\n\nAviation - The Pioneer Years\n"}

An outstanding collegian at the University of Kentucky, he was twice named an All-American en route to a still school record 25.7 points per game. The American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year in 1971, he was a six-time ABA All-Star and one-time NBA All-Star. \n\nA prolific scorer, Issel remains the all-time leading scorer at the University of Kentucky and second all-time for the NBA's Denver Nuggets and the American Basketball Association itself. Upon his retirement from the NBA in 1985, only Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Julius Erving had scored more professional points.\n\nIssel was born in Batavia, Illinois, son of Robert and Elanor Issel, and grew up with sister Kathi and brother Greg. Robert Issel owned and operated Issel Painting & Decorating. Issel attended Batavia High School, graduating in 1967 as an All-American playing for Coach Don Vandersnick. Issel led Batavia to its first Sectional title as a senior, hitting the game-winning shot against Naperville Central High School to win the title. As a senior, Issel averaged 25.8 points on Batavia's 26-3 team.\n\nGrowing up in Batavia, Issel's backyard met up with his friend Ken Anderson’s back yard. Anderson's father was a janitor at Batavia High School, and the Issel property on Harrison Street backed onto that of the Andersons' on Republic Road. Growing up together, Issel and Anderson rode in Issel's red Ford convertible and frequented the Twin Elms restaurant. Later, Anderson and Issel would co-own a 782 farm in Kentucky. Anderson became a National Football League quarterback with the Cincinnati Bengals and the 1981 NFL Most Valuable Player. Another neighbor and teammate, Byron Von Hoff, played basketball and other sports at Batavia with Anderson and Issel. Von Hoff was the 21st pick of the New York Mets in the 1966 amateur baseball draft and pitched successfully in the minor leagues before an injury ended his career. Another teammate at Batavia was future sports announcer Craig Sager, who was a freshman when Issel was a senior. Said Issel of his Batavia teammates: “What Batavia instilled in all three of us –– myself, Kenny, and Craig –– was a solid work ethic.\"\n\nAccording to \"Sports Illustrated\": Don VanDersnick showed Issel how to dunk by training him with a volleyball and had Issel jump up and grab the rim 50 times each day at practice. Issel did not start for Batavia High's basketball team until he was a junior and considered himself fortunate that he had Don Vandersnick as his coach, saying, \"If he'd told us that if we dove off a water tower it would make us better basketball players, there would have been a line waiting to do it.\"\n\nIssel was recruited by Northwestern, Illinois and Wisconsin, but he chose Kentucky. Issel then played college basketball at the University of Kentucky under legendary coach Adolph Rupp.\n\nAs a senior at Kentucky, Issel averaged 33.9 points per game (36.0 in the NCAA Tournament) to help Kentucky reach the Elite Eight.\n\nIssel was at UK 1966–1970 and scored 2,138 points (an average of 25.7 per game) and had 1078 rebounds, while being named an All American for two of the three seasons he was eligible for the award. His career points total remains the highest among UK men's players. \n\nAccording to Sports Illustrated Magazine: In a game early in Issel's Kentucky career, teammates were neglecting to give him the ball, so Rupp called a timeout, and said, \"This guy is going to be Kentucky's all-time leading scorer by the time he's through here. I thought you might like to meet him.\"\n\nOn February 7, 1970, Issel scored 53 points in a 120–85 victory over Ole Miss, breaking Cliff Hagan's single-game record of 51. Issel's mark held for almost four decades, until Jodie Meeks scored 54 points against Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel also scored 51 at Louisiana State University on February 21, 1970, currently the third-best mark in school history.\n\nA three-year starter for Kentucky, Issel led his team to three Southeastern Conference titles and set 23 school records in his career.\n\nUpon Issel's graduation in 1970 he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons (8th round) of the National Basketball Association and the Kentucky Colonels (1st round) of the American Basketball Association. Issel signed to play basketball for the Colonels and the ABA.\n\nIn his first season, Issel led the ABA in scoring with an average of 29.9 points per game, and pulled down 13.2 rebounds per game. He played in the 1971 ABA All-Star Game and was selected to the All-ABA Second Team. Issel shared ABA Rookie of the Year honors with Charlie Scott of the Virginia Squires.\n\nThe following season, Issel played in 83 of 84 games and raised his scoring average to 30.6 points per game. He was named the MVP of his second All-Star Game for scoring 21 points and collaring nine rebounds. Issel made the All-ABA First Team of that season.\n\nLed by dominating 7'2\" center Artis Gilmore, the 1974–75 Kentucky Colonels won the 1975 ABA championship, with key support from Issel and sharp-shooting guard (and fellow ex-Kentucky Wildcat) Louie Dampier. In six seasons, Issel led the league in total points three times (including a record 2,538 in 1971–72) and was an All-Star each year.\n\nPrior to the 1975–76 season, the Colonels traded Issel to the Baltimore Claws (formerly the Memphis Hustlers) for Tom Owens and cash. With Claws folding before the season's start, Issel was subsequently traded to the Denver Nuggets for Dave Robisch and cash.\n\nFor his ABA career, Issel was a 6-Time ABA All-Star, 5-Time Member of ABA All-Pro Team, the ABA's 2nd All-Time Scorer (behind Louie Dampier, was the 1972 ABA All-Star Game MVP, 1971 ABA Co-Rookie of the Year, Led ABA in scoring in 70-71 with 29.4 ppg and holds the ABA Record for most points in a season with 2,538 in 71-72.\n\nIssel remained with the Nuggets following the ABA–NBA merger in June 1976, and represented Denver in the 1977 NBA All-Star Game. He remained productive, topping 20 points per game five of his remaining eight years. Retiring following the 1984–1985 season, he received the NBA's J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1985 for his outstanding service to the community.\n\nIn nine seasons and 718 NBA games with Denver, Issel averaged 20.4 points and 7.9 rebounds per game. Wearing number 44, Issel is the Nuggets' second all-time leading scorer. He accumulated over 27,000 points in his combined ABA and NBA career, trailing only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving upon his retirement. Issel currently ranks #11 on the all time combined ABA/NBA scoring list. He missed only 24 games in 15 seasons, earning him the moniker, \"the Horse\". He was part of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 1993.\n\nAfter his playing career Issel retired to his Courtland horse farm in Woodford County, Kentucky. He spent a year doing color commentary for Kentucky basketball games then became a Nuggets broadcaster from 1988 to 1992.\n\nEven with no coaching experience, Bernie Bickerstaff recruited him as Nuggets head coach in 1992. In 1994, Issel led his team to the playoffs with their first winning record in four years, after only winning 44 games in the previous two years. That year, the Nuggets pulled off the biggest upset to that date in National Basketball Association (NBA) playoff history, knocking off the Seattle SuperSonics in five games (the first ever 8th seed to beat a 1st seed in the first round). He resigned 34 games into the 1994–95 season after facing criticism for his coaching style, saying he didn't like the person he'd become.\n\nHe returned in 1998 as president and general manager, naming himself head coach again in December 1999, yielding his general manager's title to Kiki Vandeweghe. His second tenure was far less successful; the Nuggets did not post a winning season during this time. He was hampered in part by a drawn-out effort to find a new owner; two deals to sell the team collapsed at the last minute. Just before the start of the 1999–2000 season, he told reporters that there were several decisions he simply couldn't make due to the unstable ownership situation.\n\nIn 2000, Issel faced a team mutiny after angering his team for criticizing them after a winless four-game Eastern road trip. The Nuggets' team captains called a boycott of their next practice, prompting interest from CNN and other news outlets. The team saw some improvement later in the season, but missed the playoffs with a 40–42 record.\n\nHis tenure ended on a rather sour note in December 2001. On December 11, after a close loss to the Charlotte Hornets, Issel heard a fan taunting him as he walked off the court at the Pepsi Center. Issel taunted back, \"Go drink another beer, you Mexican piece of shit.\" The incident was captured on Denver's NBC affiliate, KUSA-TV. Issel was suspended four games by the team. Issel publicly apologized the next day, and on Friday met with Hispanic chamber representatives, who accepted his apology. However, several members of Denver's Hispanic community thought the suspension was insufficient punishment, and called for him to be fired. Hours before he was due to return, Issel took a leave of absence to decide whether he wanted to return. Issel decided to resign on December 26.\n\nIssel's wife Cheri, whom he met at the University of Kentucky, is an accomplished artist. Cheri was a cheerleader at Kentucky, They have two children, Sheridan and Scott. Greg Issel, Dan's younger brother, was a star forward on Batavia teams in 1968 and 1969, following Dan. Greg Issel died suddenly of heart failure in 1998 at the age of 46.\n\nIssel filed for bankruptcy in 2009, claiming a $4.5 million debt to at least 34 creditors. To defray his debts, he sold off his 1969 Look All-America Kentucky All-Star ring, 1970 Kentucky class ring, a 1975 25th anniversary ABA All-Star ring, and a 1989 NBA All-Star ring.\n\nIn 2011, Issel lived in Los Angeles where he was executive director at the Bel Air Presbyterian Church. As of 2014, he lives in Windsor, Colorado, employed in the oil and gas business.\n\nIn 2017, Issel served as speaker at Batavia High School's gymnasium to honor a family friend, fellow Batavia classmate and national sportscaster Craig Sager after Sager's death. Sager and Issel were basketball teammates at Batavia High School, when Sager was a freshman and Issel a senior.\n\nIn February 2018, Issel's ties to the Kentucky Colonels home of Louisville, Kentucky, led him to become President of the Louisville Basketball Investment and Support Group, a Kentucky-based limited liability company founded in 2016 to pursue an NBA franchise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Bio of Issel reads:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1925840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925840", "title": "Joseph Hergesheimer", "text": "Joseph Hergesheimer\n\nJoseph Hergesheimer (February 15, 1880 – April 25, 1954) was an American writer of the early 20th century known for his naturalistic novels of decadent life amongst the very wealthy.\n\nHergesheimer was born on February 15, 1880 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was educated in a Quaker school, and he graduated from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\n\nHergesheimer published his first novel, \"The Lay Anthony\", in 1914. \"Three Black Pennys\", which followed in 1917, chronicled the fictional lives of three generations of Pennsylvania ironmasters and cemented the author's style of dealing with upperclass characters through a floridly descriptive style he referred to as \"aestheticism.\" \"Three Black Pennys\" was also the first original American novel published by the newly formed Alfred A. Knopf publishing house. Hergesheimer also received critical recognition for his novels \"Java Head\" (1919), \"Linda Condon\" (1919), and \"Balisand\" (1924).\n\nHergesheimer's reputation fluctuated wildly in his own lifetime, from a peak of acclaim and popularity in the 1920s to almost total obscurity by the time of his death. \"Java Head\", a miscegenation story told from multiple viewpoints that is generally considered his best novel, was a considerable popular success, and his flamboyant, ornate, highly descriptive style (which can be seen to best effect in works like the travelogue \"San Cristobal de la Habana\") was considered elegant and powerful. Hergesheimer's manner of writing, known at the time as the \"aesthetic\" school (in which he was frequently paired with James Branch Cabell), remained in demand throughout the 1920s (with F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" being the most durable example of a book written in this style). Sinclair Lewis's novel \"Babbitt\" includes an extensive passage in which the title character reads from \"Three Black Pennys\". A 1922 poll of critics in \"Literary Digest\" voted Hergesheimer the \"most important American writer\" working at the time. Hergesheimer's works of long-form and short fiction sold well with both male and female readerships; a 1929 teaser in for an upcoming serialized story in \"Cosmopolitan\", for example, called Hergesheimer a writer \"who understands women better than any writer alive today.\" On the other hand, John Drinkwater wrote that \"His constant complaint is that women readers, with their craving for sentimentality, are a blighting influence upon the American fiction of the age.\"\n\nTastes changed decisively in the 1930s, however, with both critics and writers favoring a more terse, tough-guy style. Hergesheimer's gift for flowery writing did not translate well in this new environment, and by the middle of the decade his popularity had fizzled. His last novel \"The Foolscap Rose\", appeared in 1934. H.L. Mencken's diary describes Hergesheimer's frustration at the decline of his popularity and the lack of interest by his publishers, and according to one literary legend, when Hergesheimer asked why nobody was interested in his books anymore, Mencken replied, \"I don't know, Joe. I'll always enjoy watching you swing from tree to tree.\"\n\nHergesheimer's reputation has not recovered from this low point, although he still has some champions. The weakness in his method can be seen in books like \"Cytherea\", wherein the author's aesthetic concerns overwhelm all other aspects of the writing, resulting in thin plot and characterization and a certain precious quality in the descriptions. Indeed, Clifton Fadiman considered his novels to be \"deficient in mere brain-power.\" On the other hand, his descriptive writing occasionally holds great power. When asked in 1962 what was his favorite American novel, Samuel Beckett replied \"one of the best I ever read was Hergesheimer's \"Java Head\".\"\n\nHis short story \"Tol'able David\" was made into a highly successful and acclaimed 1921 silent film. Other notable film adaptations include \"Java Head\" (US, 1923), \"The Bright Shawl\" (US, 1923), \"Wild Oranges\" (1924), and \"Cytherea\" (1924), and \"Java Head\" (UK, 1934). Eight films and one television special were adapted from Hergesheimer's work.\n\nHergesheimer married Dorothy Hemphill. They resided in Stone Harbor, New Jersey.\n\nHergesheimer died on April 25, 1954 in Sea Isle City, New Jersey. He was buried at Oaklands Cemetery in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n"}

E. J. Brouwer and Arend Heyting, and independently by Andrey Kolmogorov. It is also sometimes called the realizability interpretation, because of the connection with the realizability theory of Stephen Kleene.\n\nThe interpretation states what is intended to be a proof of a given formula. This is specified by induction on the structure of that formula:\n\n\nThe interpretation of a primitive proposition is supposed to be known from context. In the context of arithmetic, a proof of the formula \"s\"=\"t\" is a computation reducing the two terms to the same numeral.\n\nKolmogorov followed the same lines but phrased his interpretation in terms of problems and solutions. To assert a formula is to claim to know a solution to the problem represented by that formula. For instance formula_7 is the problem of reducing \"Q\" to \"P\"; to solve it requires a method to solve problem \"Q\" given a solution to problem \"P\".\n\nThe identity function is a proof of the formula formula_22, no matter what P is.\n\nThe law of non-contradiction formula_23 expands to formula_24:\nPutting it all together, a proof of formula_24 is a function formula_8 that converts a pair <\"a\",\"b\"> – where formula_30 is a proof of \"P\", and formula_31 is a function that converts a proof of \"P\" into a proof of formula_19 – into a proof of formula_19.\nThere is a function formula_8 that does this, where formula_42, proving the law of non-contradiction, no matter what P is. \n\nIndeed, the same line of thought provides a proof for formula_43 as well, where formula_3 is any proposition.\n\nOn the other hand, the law of excluded middle formula_45 expands to formula_46, and in general has no proof. According to the interpretation, a proof of formula_45 is a pair <\"a\", \"b\"> where \"a\" is 0 and \"b\" is a proof of \"P\", or \"a\" is 1 and \"b\" is a proof of formula_17. Thus if neither \"P\" nor formula_17 is provable then neither is formula_45.\n\nIt is not, in general, possible for a logical system to have a formal negation operator such that there is a proof of \"not\" formula_2 exactly when there isn't a proof of formula_2 ; see Gödel's incompleteness theorems. The BHK interpretation instead takes \"not\" formula_2 to mean that formula_2 leads to absurdity, designated formula_19, so that a proof of ¬formula_2 is a function converting a proof of formula_2 into a proof of absurdity.\n\nA standard example of absurdity is found in dealing with arithmetic. Assume that 0 = 1, and proceed by mathematical induction: 0 = 0 by the axiom of equality. Now (induction hypothesis), if 0 were equal to a certain natural number \"n\", then 1 would be equal to \"n\"+1, (Peano axiom: Sm\" = Sn\" if and only if \"m\" = \"n\"), but since 0=1, therefore 0 would also be equal to \"n\" + 1. By induction, 0 is equal to all numbers, and therefore any two natural numbers become equal.\n\nTherefore, there is a way to go from a proof of 0 = 1 to a proof of any basic arithmetic equality, and thus to a proof of any complex arithmetic proposition. Furthermore, to get this result it was not necessary to invoke the Peano axiom that states that 0 is \"not\" the successor of any natural number. This makes 0=1 suitable as formula_19 in Heyting arithmetic (and the Peano axiom is rewritten 0 = S\"n\" → 0 = S0). This use of 0 = 1 validates the principle of explosion.\n\nThe BHK interpretation will depend on the view taken about what constitutes a \"function\" that converts one proof to another, or that converts an element of a domain to a proof. Different versions of constructivism will diverge on this point.\n\nKleene's realizability theory identifies the functions with the computable functions. It deals with Heyting arithmetic, where the domain of quantification is the natural numbers and the primitive propositions are of the form x=y. A proof of x=y is simply the trivial algorithm if x evaluates to the same number that y does (which is always decidable for natural numbers), otherwise there is no proof. These are then built up by induction into more complex algorithms.\n\nIf one takes lambda calculus as defining the notion of a function, then the BHK interpretation describes the correspondence between natural deduction and functions.\n\n"}

The screenplay by Frank Fenton is based on a story by Louis Lantz, who borrowed his premise from the 1948 Italian film \"Bicycle Thieves\". It was made in Technicolor and CinemaScope and released by 20th Century Fox.\n\nSet in the Northwestern United States in 1875, the film focuses on taciturn widower Matt Calder (Robert Mitchum), who has recently been released from prison after serving time for killing one man while defending another. He arrives in a boomtown tent city in search of his nine-year-old son Mark (Tommy Rettig), who was left in the care of dance hall singer Kay (Marilyn Monroe) after the man who brought him there, as Matt had arranged, abandoned him. Matt promises Mark, a virtual stranger to him, the two will enjoy a life of hunting, fishing and farming on their homestead.\n\nKay's fiance, gambler Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun), tells her they must go to Council City to file the deed on a gold mine he won in a poker game. They head downriver on a homemade log raft, and when they encounter trouble in the rapids near the Calder farm, Matt and Mark rescue them. Harry offers to buy Matt's rifle and horse so as to reach Council City by land. When Matt refuses, Harry knocks Matt unconscious and steals both horse and rifle. Kay chooses to stay behind to take care of Matt and Mark, and the three are stranded in the wilderness.\n\nWhen hostile Indians attack the farm, the three are forced to escape down the river on Harry's raft. That night they set up camp by the river, and Matt and Kay argue about the wisdom of pursuing Harry. Matt asks why Kay would choose to marry a man who had endangered a child, whereupon she reminds him that Harry never killed a man like Matt did. Mark overhears their discussion, and Matt is forced to reveal the truth about his past to his son, who is unable to comprehend why his father acted as he did.\n\nAs the three continue their journey, Kay comes to appreciate Matt's bravery and the tender way he cares for both her and Mark. Along the way, they are forced to deal with a series of trials and tribulations, including a mountain lion attack; gold prospectors Sam Benson and Dave Colby, who are after Harry for stealing their claim; and a second Indian war party.\n\nAfter a difficult ride through the worst of the rapids, the three arrive in Council City and confront Harry. Harry shoots at Matt, prompting Mark to shoot Harry in the back, using a rifle that he was inspecting in the general store. As a result, Mark comes to understand why his father had to shoot a man in a similar fashion so many years before.\n\nAfterwards, Kay finds a job at the local saloon. While she is singing there, Matt walks into the saloon and throws Kay over his shoulder to take her back to his farm along with Mark. She happily leaves with him. The final scene is Kay throwing her high heeled showgirl shoes from their buckboard into the street, a renunciation of her old life.\n\n\nOtto Preminger was preparing for the opening of \"The Moon Is Blue\" when 20th Century Fox executive Darryl F. Zanuck assigned him to direct \"River of No Return\" as part of his contract with the studio. Because of their previous experience with Westerns, producer Stanley Rubin had wanted William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, or Henry King to helm the film, and he was concerned Preminger, who he felt was better suited for film noir melodrama or sophisticated comedy, would be unable to rise to the task of directing a piece of Americana. Preminger himself had no interest in the project until he read the screenplay and saw potential in the story. He also approved of Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe, who already had been cast in the lead roles.\n\nZanuck decided the film should be made in CinemaScope and increased the budget accordingly. Much of it would be filmed in Banff, Jasper National Parks, Lake Louise in Alberta and the Salmon River in Idaho where the story actually takes place. Preminger and Rubin flew to the area to scout locations. During their time there, Rubin grew fond of the director and began to feel that rather than viewing it as a contractual obligation, Preminger had a real interest in making the film.\n\nRubin scheduled twelve weeks of preproduction, during which Monroe rehearsed and recorded the musical numbers written by Ken Darby and Lionel Newman, and forty-five days for filming.\n\nThe cast and crew departed for Calgary in late June 1953. From there they traveled by special train to the Banff Springs Hotel, which would serve as their base during the Canadian filming.\n\nMonroe was accompanied by Natasha Lytess, her acting coach. Preminger clashed with the woman from the very start. She insisted on taking her client aside and giving her direction contrary to that of Preminger, and she had the actress enunciating each syllable of every word of dialogue with exaggerated emphasis. Preminger called Rubin in Los Angeles and insisted Lytess be banned from the set, but when the producer complied with his demand, Monroe called Zanuck directly and asserted she couldn't continue unless Lytess returned. Zanuck commiserated with Preminger but, feeling Monroe was a major box office draw he couldn't afford to upset, he reinstated Lytess. Angered by the decision, Preminger directed his rage at Monroe for the rest of the production.\n\nDuring the difficult shoot, Preminger also had to contend with frequent rain, Mitchum's heavy drinking, and an injury to Monroe's ankle that kept her off the set for several days and ultimately put her in a cast. Monroe nearly drowned while filming. She had donned chest-high hip waders during rehearsal to protect her costume. She slipped on a rock, the waders filled with water, and she was unable to rise. Mitchum and others jumped in the river to rescue her but her ankle was sprained as a result. Young Tommy Rettig seemed to be the director's sole source of solace. He respected Rettig's professionalism and appreciated the rapport he developed with Monroe, which often helped keep her on an even keel. When Lytess began to interfere with Rettig's performance, thereby undermining his confidence, Preminger let the cast and crew know about her behavior and was delighted to find they finally began to support him in his efforts to remove her from the set.\n\nIn early September, filming shifted to Los Angeles for interior scenes and close-ups for a river sequence. The latter was filmed in a tank, whereas stunt doubles were used in the long shots filmed on location in Idaho in the actual River of No Return, the Salmon River. Monroe was on crutches, and Preminger had to work around her as much as possible. Despite frequent disagreements with Rubin, Preminger completed the film on September 29, on schedule and within the budget.\n\nThe film was one of the very first films to use a blood squib to simulate realistic bullet impact. This occurs when Harry (Rory Calhoun) is shot dead in the film's climax. As such, the film beats \"Run of the Arrow\" (1957) - which is often credited with being the first to use blood squibs - by three years.\n\nThis movie was the first to be filmed in CinemaScope in Canada. \"River of No Return\" was the first film released by 20th Century-Fox to feature the \"CinemaScope extension\" fanfare before the opening credits. Written by Alfred Newman, it's a rerecording of his original 1933 fanfare, with the extra few bars that play under the credit \"20th Century-Fox presents A CinemaScope Production\". After Fox switched to Panavision in 1967, they went back to their old fanfare, so the extension fanfare wasn't used again until it was revived by George Lucas to play before the opening credits to Star Wars. This time, those few extra bars played under the credit \" A Lucasfilm Production\". Since then it's been re-recorded a few times but remains to this day the intro to every film released by that studio.\n\nDuring post-production, Preminger departed for Europe, leaving editor Louis R. Loeffler and Rubin to complete the film. Jean Negulesco was called in to film a few retakes. The dailies reconfirmed Rubin's belief that Preminger had been the wrong choice for the project. He felt the director had failed to capture the Western aura, had ignored key elements in the plot, and had perfunctorily directed action sequences, leaving them looking staged and static. In several cases, studio and location shots didn't match.\n\nPreminger's experience on the film convinced him he never wanted to work as a studio employee again, and he paid Fox $150,000 to cancel the remainder of his contract.\n\nIn later years, Monroe claimed \"River of No Return\" was her worst film, and Preminger spoke bitterly about her in numerous interviews. It wasn't until January 1980, when being interviewed for the \"New York Daily News\", that he conceded, \"She tried very hard, and when people try hard, you can't be mad at them.\"\n\nThe \"River of No Return\" had its world premiere in Denver, Colorado on April 29, 1954; and released theatrically in the United States in New York on April 30, 1954 and in Los Angeles on May 5.\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on May 14, 2002. It is in anamorphic widescreen format with audio tracks in English and French and subtitles in English and Spanish. In the United States 20th Century Fox released the film on Blu-ray disc on July 31, 2012 for the first time with the original theatrical trailer as the sole extra feature.\n\nBosley Crowther of the \"New York Times\" observed, \"It is a toss-up whether the scenery or the adornment of Marilyn Monroe is the feature of greater attraction in \"River of No Return\" ... The mountainous scenery is spectacular, but so, in her own way, is Miss Monroe. The patron's preference, if any, probably will depend upon which he's interested in. Certainly, scriptwriter Frank Fenton has done the best he could to arrange for a fairly equal balance of nature and Miss Monroe ... And that should not be too lightly taken. For Director Otto Preminger has thrown all the grandeur and menace of these features upon the eye-filling CinemaScope screen. A sickening succession of rapids, churned into boiling foam, presents a display of nature's violence that cannot help but ping the patron's nerves. The raft tumbling through these rapids is quite a sight to see. And layouts of Rocky Mountain landscapes are handsome in color, too. But Mr. Mitchum's and the audience's attention is directed to Miss Monroe through frequent and liberal posing of her in full and significant views.\"\n\n\"Variety\" said, \"The competition between scenic splendors of the Jasper and Banff National Parks and entertainment values finds the former finishing slightly ahead on merit, although there's enough rugged action and suspense moments to get the production through its footage. In between the high spots, Otto Preminger's directorial pacing is inclined to lag, so the running time seems overlong.\"\n\n\"TV Guide\" rated it out of four stars, calling it \"a simple, frequently charming, and beautifully photographed film blessed with fine performances and great teamwork from Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe\" and \"an enjoyable, engaging little Western that never fails to entertain.\"\n\nFilm4 called it a \"patchy drama which owes more to its gorgeous scenery and musical numbers than it does to anything else ... The plot doesn't convince, but Monroe, at the peak of her career, is more than easy on the eye ... Despite some pretty locations and occasional tension, there's little going on. A shallow river indeed.\"\n\n"}

In protest, male jockeys unanimously refused to ride in the first few races in which she was slated to compete at the Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky to prevent her from competing.\n\nIn the midst of this controversy the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association signed Early to a contract to play basketball for the team. Early had not played basketball at any level. At just 5'3\" and 112 pounds, she was also the smallest pro basketball player ever. Management, including Colonels owners Joseph and Mamie Gregory, ordered coach Gene Rhodes to play Early in a game. Rhodes was not amused and protested to management.\n\nPenny's moment came on Wednesday, November 27, 1968, against the Los Angeles Stars. Wearing a miniskirt and a turtleneck sweater with a number 3 on the back (to represent the three boycotted races at Churchill Downs), Early warmed up with the players and sat on the bench with the team.\n\nEarly in the game, during a timeout, Rhodes reluctantly sent Early to the scorer's table, where she checked into the game. In the Kentucky backcourt she took the ball out of bounds and inbounded it to teammate Bobby Rascoe. He quickly called a timeout and the Colonels removed Early from the game to a standing ovation. Afterward, she signed hundreds of autographs.\n\nPenny Ann was often accused of trying to gain publicity more so than mounts. She was so frustrated with maintaining her weight and getting enough mounts that she quit to become a trainer. In 1974, at the age of 30, she went on a strict diet and worked diligently to get her weight down; however, her comeback was short-lived when she broke her arm, ankle, wrist, and some ribs in a racing spill.

The ballpark is notable for holding a memorial service for the late pop musician and Gary native Michael Jackson on July 10, 2009 that was attended by over 6,000 fans, with much of Jackson's family in attendance. The ballpark has had over 2 million fans in attendance during the RailCats team history.\n\nIn February 2001, the Northern League's Board of Directors approved a request by company Northwest Sports Ventures to start an expansion baseball team in Gary, Indiana. The team was scheduled to start play in the 2002 Northern League season. Later that year, a liability company named Victory Sports Group took the task to build a ballpark in downtown Gary. Then, in July 2001, the City of Gary and Victory agree on a 15-year lease that would facilitate the building of a state-of-the-art ballpark with construction scheduled to be completed in May 2002; the groundbreaking ceremony was held at this time. In September 2001, the ownership names this baseball team the Gary SouthShore RailCats, with their stadium to be called RailCats Stadium.\n\nThen, in October 2001, the City of Gary and the construction and architectural companies involved in the building of the new ballpark announced that it would not be completed in time for the 2002 Northern League season. As a result, all the RailCats' games in their inaugural 2002 season would be played on the road. During the 2002 season, the RailCats would travel more than and spend more than 800 hours on the road in buses. RailCats Stadium was completed in August 2002, with a dedication ceremony and open house being held on August 8. The first baseball games to be played in this stadium were part of a Little League Baseball tournament held the following week. The stadium would also host various Gospel and Blues events throughout the next few months.\n\nThen, in May 2003, the RailCats' ownership and U.S. Steel sign a 10-year naming rights agreement, effectively renaming the ballpark U.S. Steel Yard.

At the service, Gary mayor Rudy Clay unveiled a granite plaque of Jackson. Originally, Clay talked to the Jackson family about having Michael's body be on display in Gary for the service, saying that the service would be \"fit for the prince of peace and a memorial that's fit for Gary, Indiana's favorite son, the greatest entertainer that ever lived\". This was discussed as part of a plan to have Jackson buried in Gary.

He was Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology at University of California at Berkeley.\n\nGofman pioneered the field of clinical lipidology, and was honoured with the title of \"Father of Clinical Lipidology\" by the Journal of Clinical Lipidology in 2007. With Frank T. Lindgren and other research associates, Gofman discovered and described three major classes of plasma lipoproteins, fat molecules that carry cholesterol in the blood. The team he led at the Donner Laboratory went on to demonstrate the role of lipoproteins in the causation of heart disease.\nGofman was instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the cancer risks of ionizing radiation and to adopt the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model as a means of estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation and as the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection. However his conclusions were that the dose-response relationship was not linear, but supra-linear .\n\nGofman's earliest research was in nuclear physics and chemistry, in close connection to the Manhattan Project. He co-discovered several radioisotopes, notably uranium-233 and its fissionability ; he was the third person ever to work with plutonium, and, having devised an early process for separating plutonium from fission products at J. Robert Oppenheimer's request, he was the first chemist ever to try and isolate milligram quantities of plutonium.\n\nIn 1963, Gofman established the Biomedical Research Division for the Livermore National Laboratory, where he was on the cutting edge of research into the connection between chromosomal abnormalities and cancer.\n\nLater in life, Gofman took on a role as an advocate warning of dangers involved with nuclear power. From 1971 onward, he was the Chairman of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \"his pioneering work in exposing the health effects of low-level radiation\" on Chernobyl disaster's area population.\n\nIn his 1996 book , Gofman claimed that exposure to medical x-rays is responsible for about 75 percent of breast cancers in the United States. This order of magnitude has been somehow confirmed by the increase in breast cancer incidence following mammography screening in the USA and in France.\nJohn Gofman graduated from Oberlin College with a bachelor's in chemistry in 1939, and received a doctorate in nuclear and physical chemistry from Berkeley in 1943, where he worked as a graduate student under Glenn T. Seaborg, the discoverer of plutonium and later a chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. In his PhD dissertation, Gofman described the discovery of radioisotopes protactinium-232, uranium-232, protactinium-233, as well as uranium-233 and the characterization of its fissionability. Seaborg had a very high opinion of Gofman : he called Gofman one of his \"most brilliant students\" when, in 1963, he appointed him to head the Biomedical Research Division at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory; he wrote that his PhD dissertation was \"very brilliant\".\n\nGofman shared three patents with collaborators on their discoveries :\n\nGofman later became the group co-leader of the Plutonium Project, an offshoot of the Manhattan Project.\n\nDr. Gofman earned his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco, in 1946. After that, he and his collaborators investigated the body's lipoproteins, which contain both proteins and fats, and their circulation within the bloodstream. The researchers described low-density and high-density lipoproteins and their roles in metabolic disorders and coronary disease. This work continued throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nAt the request of Ernest Lawrence, Gofman established the Medical Department at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in early 1954 and acted as the Medical Director until 1957 roughly two days a week while teaching at Berkeley the rest of the time.\n\nIn 1962, the US had resumed atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons at the Nevada test site in 1962. The State of Utah had set up its own network of monitoring facilities to test milk for radioiodine, since \"data pertaining to the safety of the citizens of Utah was not forthcoming from the AEC\", and the levels of radioactivity were found to be close to the limits prescribed by the Federal Radiation Council. The Commissioners of the AEC were \"on the hot seat\" and announced \"a comprehensive, long-range program\" to explore the effects of man-made radioactivity \"upon plants, animals and human beings\". At the request of the US Atomic Energy Commission and of LLNL's director John Foster, Gofman reluctantly accepted to establish the Biomedical Research Division for the LLNL in 1963. He served as the first director of the LLNL biomedical research division from 1963 to 1965 and as one of the nine associate directors of the entire lab until 1969.\n\nThe AEC had acted too fast in response to public outcry : one of the five Commissioners, James T. Ramey, had not been consulted before announcing the establishment of the Biomedical Research Division. Gofman reported that \"Apparently it would have been too embarrassing, with the extensive AEC publicity about the program, to cancel it outright. Instead, the budget was cut even from the low starting value and we were given to understand, in no uncertain terms, that the program was not going to be supported at the level required to do the tasks outlined originally.\" However, Gofman and colleagues \"accepted the reduced program, knowing that [they] could certainly still do much of the important work on radiation hazards.\"\n\nAfter the atmospheric test ban treaty was signed in June 1963 and the public pressure on AEC was released, \"[t]he Joint Committee on Atomic Energy struck from the AEC budget the funds that were to be used to construct a Bio-Medical complex at Livermore. This was tantamount to the JCAE stating that the Livermore Bio-Medical Program was unnecessary, for without facilities to work in it was hard to envision much of a program being possible.\" LLNL's director John Foster and Gofman had to struggle to obtain the initially promised funds.\n\nIn 1959, the geneticist Edward B. Lewis computed that children exposed to fallout from nuclear tests may have received very high doses of radioactivity from iodine-131 in cow milk. His estimates prompted the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to request that the AEC produce a report on the risks of short-lived isotopes. In 1960, Harold A. Knapp, a mathematician working within the AEC Division of Biology and Medicine's Fallout Studies Branch, authored this report, but since it was finished during an international moratorium on atmospheric nuclear tests, it had no notable impact. Then, in 1962, while the USSR and the USA had resumed nuclear tests and the Limited Test Ban Treaty was being prepared in response to huge international pressure, Knapp took on the task of estimating the radioiodine exposure of Americans before 1958, at a time when milk was not monitored. Knapp conclusions were alarming, and blatantly departed from preceding AEC's reassurances that the public had never been exposed to harmful levels of radioactivity. He \"showed that, from just one 1953 test, infants who had been living in a radiation hotspot around St. George, Utah, might well have received I-131 doses anywhere from 150 to 750 times existing annual permissible doses.\" \n\nBeginning in fall 1962, the AEC resorted to diverse pretexts to block the publication of Knapp's findings. In spring 1963, Gofman, was solicited to participate in a so-called \"Ad Hoc Working Group on Radioiodine and the Environment\" assembled by AEC's Division of Operational Safety's director, Gordon Dunning. Gofman reported that \"In essence, the message to [this] Committee […] was « How can we stop this report - a report which will, in effect, make the AEC reports over the past 10 years look untrue? »\". In spite of AEC's Headquarters' objections, the committee recommended publication of Knapp's report, which was finally published by the AEC in June 1963, followed by a summary in \"Nature\".\n\nIn 1964, Gofman raised questions about a lack of data on low-level radiation and also proposed a wide-ranging study of exposure in medicine and the workplace at a symposium for nuclear scientists and engineers. This helped start a national inquiry into the safety of atomic power. With his colleague Dr. Arthur R. Tamplin, Dr. Gofman then looked at health studies of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as other epidemiological studies, and conducted research on radiation's influences on human chromosomes. The two scientists suggested that federal safety guidelines for low-level exposures be reduced by 90 percent in 1969. The Atomic Energy Commission contested the findings, and \"the furor made Dr. Gofman a reluctant figurehead of the anti-nuclear movement\" according to \"The New York Times\". In 1970, he testified in favor of a bill to ban commercial nuclear reactors in New York City and told the City Council that a reactor in an urban environment would be \"equal in the opposite direction to all the medical advances put together in the last 25 years.\"\n\nGofman and Tamplin were instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the somatic (i.e. leukemia and cancer) risks of ionizing radiation, at a time when only the genetic risks were considered of significant concern, and to adopt the so-called Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model \"as a means of numerically estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation\", which \"was a watershed event in radiation-safety science and politics\". The LNT model has since become the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection.\n\nIndeed, it was Gofman and Tamplin's argumented opposition to the Federal Radiation Council (FRC) radiation-safety guidelines who prompted the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on the recommendation made in December 1969 by Victor Bond, \"a prominent health physicist and chairman of the NAS-NRC Subcommittee on Radiobiology of the Committee on Nuclear Science\", to gather its first BEIR (Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) committee. According to an internal memo cited by Semendeferi, the BEIR I committee was to \"thoroughly digest and carefully analyze various pertinent controversial models (Gofman and Tamplin)\".\n\nAfter two years of study, the BEIR I committee published its famous BEIR I report in November 1972. Although departing from Gofman and Tamplin's work on significant aspects, it nevertheless vindicated their arguments to a large extent. Semendeferi notes that \"[t]he report's long bibliography cited almost all of Gofman and Tamplin's work. Echoing Gofman and Tamplin, the BEIR I Committee emphasized that the cancer effects of low-level radiation were of much greater concern than leukemia or genetic effects. The current radiation limit was \"based on genetic considerations,\" and the committee concluded that the FRC limit was therefore \"unnecessarily high\" and could safely be much lower.\"\n\nSemendeferi reports that, according to the radiobiologist and environmental health specialist Edward Radford, who was a member of the BEIR I committee and the chairman of the BEIR III committee, \"Gofman deserved credit for raising the issue of the somatic ris's of low-level radiation as early as he did\", but \"never received the recognition he deserved for his contributions to radiation-safety science\" because he was \"stigmatized as an extreme antinuclear scientist\".\nGofman retired as a teaching professor in 1973 and became a professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology.\n\nGofman testified on the behalf of Samuel Lovejoy at Lovejoy's 1974 trial. Lovejoy was charged with malicious destruction of property for toppling a weather tower in Montague, Massachusetts, owned by Northeast Utilities. Lovejoy's actions were an act of protest against a proposed nuclear power plant, Montague Nuclear Power Plant, to be built on Montague Plains. Lovejoy was inspired by Gofman's book, \"Poisoned Power\".\n\nGofman used his low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. Studies of the health effects of the Three Mile Island accident have so far (by 2013) not observed any excess mortality. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population. However, excess leukemia among males was observed. The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of epidemiological methodology, such as problems in dose and illness classifications.\n\nThree months after the Chernobyl disaster, Gofman predicted that Chernobyl would cause \"475,000 fatal cancers plus about \nan equal number of additional non-fatal cases, occurring over time both inside and outside the ex-Soviet Union\". In contrast, even some 19 years later in September 2005, an official UN IAEA report claimed 4,000 deaths as the final estimated toll from Chernobyl. In their 2006 book Alexey V. Yablokov and other Russian and East European researchers estimated that Chernobyl caused a million deaths through 2004, nearly 170,000 of them in North America. The book's English translation was published by the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009. The book cites \"5,000 mainly Slavic-language scientific papers the IAEA overlooked\", notwithstanding the fact that 13 of the authors of the Chernobyl Forum were from Ukraine, Russia or Belarus. M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book. M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book's estimation of Chernobyl's excess deaths and radiation-induced health effects and claimed the numbers were exaggerations which \"could lead quite unnecessarily to a panic reaction\". Rosalie Bertell has asserted the above estimates of Gofman (1986) and Yablokov (2006) are too conservative.\n\nAfter a speech Gofman gave on nuclear waste at a national conference of activists in the summer of 1990, Charles Butler approached him for help. Butler was a retired physicist living in the Mojave Desert town of Needles, California, and was looking for help to stop the proposed low-level nuclear waste facility at Ward Valley. Gofman referred him to the Abalone Alliance Clearinghouse in San Francisco. With less than two weeks before the closure of the Environmental Impact Statement, the Alliance was able to mount a letter writing campaign that helped delay the EIS for an additional 90 days. This initial delay gave activists the time to form Don't Waste California and build a grassroots campaign that eventually stopped Ward Valley from opening.\n\nGofman also did work on the Diablo Canyon Power Plant.\n\nGofman considered that \"nuclear deterrence is important\", for he did not believe that comprehensive test bans were enforceable ; thus he favored underground atomic bomb tests while acknowledging that \"They are harmful, a little will leak out. A small number of people will get hurt.\" He claimed \"I don't understand the disarmament movement\". More precisely, he was of the opinion that if the US were to disarm unilaterally, \"the Soviet leaders may well try to make [the US] a slave state. […] There will surely never be a solution to human problems by any coercion or force. But there will also never be a solution through unarmed freedom as long as powerful bullies exist who will \"use\" force.\"\n\nGofman was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Jewish parents, David and Sarah Gofman, who immigrated to the USA from czarist Russia in about 1905. His father had been \"involved in some of the early revolutionary activities against the Czar.\" Gofman died of heart failure at age 88 on August 15, 2007 in his home in San Francisco.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most of them involve merging of vowel distinctions, so that fewer vowel phonemes occur before than in other positions in a word.\n\nIn rhotic dialects, is pronounced in most cases. In General American English (GA), is pronounced as an approximant or in most positions, but after some vowels is pronounced as \"r\"-coloring. In Scottish English, is traditionally pronounced as a flap or trill , and there are no \"r\"-colored vowels.\n\nIn non-rhotic dialects like Received Pronunciation (RP), historic is elided at the end of a syllable, and if the preceding vowel is stressed, it undergoes compensatory lengthening or breaking (diphthongization). Thus, words that historically had often have long vowels or centering diphthongs ending in a schwa , or a diphthong followed by a schwa.\n\nIn most English dialects, there are vowel shifts that affect only vowels before , or vowels that were historically followed by . Vowel shifts before historical fall into two categories: mergers and splits. Mergers are more common, and therefore most English dialects have fewer vowel distinctions before historical than in other positions in a word.\n\nIn many North American dialects, there are ten or eleven stressed monophthongs; only five or six vowel (rarely, seven) contrasts are possible before a preconsonantal and word-final (\"beer, bear, burr, bar, bore, bor, boor\"). Often, more contrasts exist when appears between vowels is not in the same syllable; in some American dialects and in most native English dialects outside North America, for example, \"mirror\" and \"nearer\" do not rhyme, and some or all of \"marry\", \"merry\" and \"Mary\" are pronounced distinctly. (In North America, these distinctions are most likely to occur in New York City, Philadelphia, some of Eastern New England (for some, including Boston), and in conservative Southern accents.) In many dialects, however, the number of contrasts in this position tends to be reduced, and the tendency seems to be towards further reduction. The difference in how these reductions have been manifested represents one of the greatest sources of cross-dialect variation.\n\nNon-rhotic accents in many cases show mergers in the same positions as rhotic accents do, even though there is often no phoneme present. This results partly from mergers that occurred before the was lost, and partly from later mergers of the centering diphthongs and long vowels that resulted from the loss of .\n\nThe phenomenon that occurs in many dialects of the United States is one of tense–lax neutralization, where the normal English distinction between tense and lax vowels is eliminated.\n\nIn some cases, the quality of a vowel before is different from the quality of the vowel elsewhere. For example, in some dialects of American English the quality of the vowel in \"more\" typically does not occur except before , and is somewhere in between the vowels of \"maw\" and \"mow\". It is similar to the vowel of the latter word, but without the glide.\n\nIt is important to note however that different mergers occur in different dialects. Among United States accents, the Boston, Eastern New England and New York accents have the lowest degree of pre-rhotic merging. Some have observed that rhotic North American accents are more likely to have such merging than non-rhotic accents, but this cannot be said of rhotic British accents like Scottish English, which is firmly rhotic and yet many varieties have all the same vowel contrasts before as before any other consonant.\n\nMost North American English dialects merge the lax vowels with the tense vowels before . \"marry\" and \"merry\" have the same vowel as \"mare\", \"mirror\" has the same vowel as \"mere\", \"forest\" has the same vowel as the stressed form of \"for\", and \"hurry\" has the same vowel as \"stir\" for these speakers. These mergers are typically resisted for nonrhotic North Americans and are largely absent in areas of the United States that were historically largely nonrhotic.\n\nThe \"hurry\"–\"furry\" merger occurs when the vowel before intervocalic is merged with , particularly a feature in most dialects of North American English, although it is resisted in New York City English, Mid-Atlantic American English, older Southern American English, and some speakers of Eastern New England English. Speakers with this merger pronounce \"hurry\" so that it rhymes with \"furry\", and \"turret\" so that it rhymes with \"stir it\".\n\nBritish English and most other English outside of North America maintains the distinction between these two sounds, so that in their dialects, \"hurry\" and \"furry\" do not rhyme.\n\nIn General American there is a three-way merger between the first vowels in \"hurry\" and \"furry\" as well as the unstressed vowel in \"letters\". In RP, all of these have different sounds (, and , respectively) and there exist some minimal pairs between unstressed and , such as \"foreword\" vs. \"forward\" . In GA, these collapse to , though in phonemic transcription they can still be differentiated as and to facilitate comparisons with other accents. Furthermore, GA often lacks a proper opposition between and , which makes minimal pairs such as \"unorthodoxy\" and \"an orthodoxy\" variably homophonous as . See strut–comma merger for more information.\n\nIn New Zealand English there is a consistent contrast between \"hurry\" and \"furry\", but the unstressed is lengthened to (phonetically ) in many positions (particularly in formal or slow speech), especially when it is spelled . Thus, \"boarded\" and \"bordered\" might be distinguished as and (homophonous in Australia as and distinguished in RP as and ), based on length and rounding of . This change was caused by a complete phonemic merger of and , a weak vowel merger generalized to all environments.\n\nOne notable merger of vowels before is the \"Mary\"–\"marry\"–\"merry\" merger, which consists of a merging of the vowels (as in the name \"Carrie\" or the word \"marry\") and (as in \"Kerry\" or \"merry\") with historical (as in \"Cary\" or \"Mary\") whenever they are realised before intervocalic (the \"r\" sound when occurring between vowels). No contrast exist before a final or preconsonantal . This merger is fairly widespread, in that it is complete or at a near-complete stage in most varieties of North American English, but rare in other varieties of English. The following variants are common in North America:\n\nThe three are kept distinct outside of North America. In accents that do not have the merger, \"Mary\" has the \"a\" sound of \"mare\", \"marry\" has the \"short \"a\"\" sound of \"mat\", and merry has the \"short \"e\"\" sound of \"met\". In modern RP, they are pronounced as , , and ; in Australian English as , , and ; in New York City English as , , and ; in Philadelphia English, the same as New York, except \"merry\" is . There is plenty of variance in the distribution of the merger, with expatriate communities of these speakers being formed all over the country.\n\nThe \"Mary\"–\"merry\" merger is possible in New Zealand English, in which the quality of the merged vowel is (similar to in General American). However, in NZE, the vowel in \"Mary\" often merges with the vowel instead (see near–square merger), which before intervocalic may in turn merge with , so that \"Mary\" (phonemically ) can be or instead. In all of those cases there is a clear distinction between \"Mary\" and \"merry\" on one hand (however they are pronounced) and \"marry\" (with the vowel) on the other.\n\nThe \"merry\"–\"Murray\" merger (sometimes called the \"ferry\"–\"furry\" merger, but that is the case only for speakers who also have the \"hurry\"–\"furry\" merger) is a merger of and before (both neutralized with syllabic \"r\") that is common in the Philadelphia accent. This accent does not usually have the \"marry\"–\"merry\" merger. That is, \"short a\" as in \"marry\" is a distinct unmerged class before . Thus, \"merry\" and \"Murray\" are pronounced the same, but \"marry\" is distinct from this pair.\nAnother widespread merger is the \"mirror\"–\"nearer\" merger or \"Sirius\"–\"serious\" merger of with before intervocalic (in other words, the sound \"r\" when between vowels). The typical result of the merger in General American is or . For speakers with this merger, common in general accents throughout North America, \"mirror\" and \"nearer\" rhyme, and \"Sirius\" is homophonous with \"serious\". North Americans who do not merge these vowels often speak the more conservative northeastern or southern accents.\n\nWords that would have a stressed before intervocalic in the UK's Received Pronunciation (RP) are treated differently in different varieties of North American English. As shown in the table below, in Canadian English, all of these are pronounced with , as in \"cord\". In the accents of Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and the Carolinas (and traditionally throughout the South), these words are pronounced among some with , as in \"card\" (and thus merge with historic prevocalic in words like \"starry\"). In the accents of New York City, Long Island, and nearby parts of New Jersey, these words are pronounced with like in RP. However, this is met with hypercorrection of , (thus still merging with historic prevocalic in \"starry\"). On the other hand, the traditional Eastern New England accents (famously, the Rhode Island and Boston accents) these words are pronounced with , but that is a free vowel (the outcome of the cot–caught merger) and in that regard it is the same as Canadian , rather than RP . Most of the rest of the United States (marked \"General American\" in the table), however, has a distinctive mixed system: while the majority of words are pronounced as in Canada, the four (sometimes five) words in the left-hand column are typically pronounced with ; and the East Coast regions seem to be slowly moving toward this system over time.\n\nIn accents with the horse–hoarse merger, also includes the historic in words such as \"glory\" and \"force\". When an accent also features the cot–caught merger, is typically analyzed as to avoid postulating a separate phoneme that occurs only before , so that both \"cord\" and \"glory\" are considered to contain the phoneme in California, Canada and other places. Therefore, in the horse–hoarse merged accents and are different analyses of the same word \"cord\" and there may be little to no difference in the realization of the vowel.\n\nEven in the East Coast accents of the United States without the split (Boston, New York City, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, and some coastal Southern), some of the words in the original short-\"o\" class often show influence from other American dialects and end up with anyway. For instance, some speakers from the Northeast pronounce \"Florida\", \"orange\", and \"horrible\" with , but \"foreign\" and \"origin\" with . Exactly which words are affected by this differs from dialect to dialect and occasionally from speaker to speaker, an example of sound change by lexical diffusion.\n\nThe Middle English merger of the vowels with the spellings and now affects all modern varieties of English that makes words like \"sour\" and \"hour\", which originally had one syllable, have two syllables, and thus rhyme with \"power\". In accents that lack the merger, \"sour\" has one syllable and \"power\" has two syllables. Similar mergers also occur where 'hire' gains a syllable making it homophonous with 'higher', and 'coir' gains a syllable making it homophonous with 'coyer'.\n\nThe card\"–\"cord\" merger or cord\"–\"card\" merger is a merger of Early Modern English with , resulting in homophony of pairs like \"card\"/\"cord\", \"barn\"/\"born\" and \"far\"/\"for\". It is roughly similar to the father–bother merger but before \"r\". The merger is found in some Caribbean English accents, in some versions of the West Country accent in England and in some accents of Southern American English. Areas of the United States in which the merger is most common include Central Texas, Utah, and St. Louis, but it is not dominant even there, and it is rapidly disappearing. In the United States, dialects with the \"card\"–\"cord\" merger are some of the only ones without the horse–hoarse merger, with a well-documented correlation. \n\nIn Modern English dialects, the reflexes of Early Modern English and are highly susceptible to phonemic merger with other vowels. Words belonging to this class are most commonly spelled with \"oor\", \"our\", \"ure\", or \"eur\"; examples include \"poor\", \"tour\", \"cure\", \"Europe\" (words such as \"moor\" ultimately from Old English ō words). Wells refers to this class as the words, after the keyword of the lexical set to which he assigns them.\n\nIn traditional Received Pronunciation and General American, words are pronounced with RP ( before a vowel) and GenAm . But these pronunciations are being replaced by other pronunciations in many English accents.\n\nIn southern England English it is now common to pronounce words with , so that \"moor\" is often pronounced , \"tour\" , \"poor\" . The traditional form is much more common in the northern counties of England. A similar merger is encountered in many varieties of American English, where the pronunciations or ⁓ (depending on whether the accent is rhotic or non-rhotic) prevail. For many American English speakers historical merges with either when it follows palatal consonants in words like \"cure\", \"sure\", \"pure\" and \"mature\" or in other environments such as words like \"poor\" and \"moor\".\n\nIn Australian and New Zealand English the centring diphthong has practically disappeared, replaced in some words by (a sequence of two separate monophthongs) and in some by (a long monophthong). The outcome that occurs in a particular word is not always predictable, but, for example, \"pure\", \"cure\" and \"tour\" come to rhyme with \"fewer\", having , while \"poor\", \"moor\" and \"sure\" come to rhyme with \"for\" and \"paw\", having .\n\nIn East Anglia a merger in which words like \"fury\" merge to the sound of \"furry\" is common, especially after palatal and palatoalveolar consonants, so that \"sure\" is often pronounced (which is also a common single-word merger in American English, in which the word \"sure\" is often ); yod-dropping may apply as well, yielding pronunciations such as for \"pure\". Other pronunciations in \"cure\"–\"fir\" merging dialects include \"pure\", \"curious\", \"bureau\", \"mural\".\nVarieties of Southern American English, Midland American English, and High Tider English may merge words like \"fire\" and \"far\" or \"tired\" and \"tarred\" in the direction of the second words: . This results in a \"tire\"–\"tar\" merger, but with \"tower\" kept distinct.\n\nSome accents of southern British English (including many types of RP, as well as the accent of Norwich) have mergers of the vowels in words like \"tire\", \"tar\" (already merged with as in \"palm\"), and \"tower\". Thus, the triphthong of \"tower\" merges either with the of \"tire\" (both surfacing as diphthongal ) or with the of \"tar\". Some speakers merge all three sounds, so that \"tower\", \"tire\", and \"tar\" are all homophonous as .\n\nThe horse\"–\"hoarse\" merger or merger is the merger of the vowels and before historic , making pairs of words like \"horse\"–\"hoarse\", \"for\"–\"four\", \"war\"–\"wore\", \"or\"–\"oar\", \"morning\"–\"mourning\" etc. homophones. Historically, the class belonged to the phoneme (as in contemporary RP \"lot\"), whereas the class was (as in Scottish English \"go), akin to the contrast between the short lax and the long tense in German.\n\nThis merger occurs in most varieties of English today, despite historically keeping the two phonemes separate. In accents that have the merger, \"horse\" and \"hoarse\" are both pronounced , but in accents that do not have the merger \"hoarse\" is pronounced with a higher vowel, usually in rhotic and or the like in non-rhotic accents. Non-merging accents include most Scottish, Caribbean, and older Southern American accents, plus some African American vernacular, modern Southern American, Indian, Irish, and older Maine accents. Some American speakers retain the original length distinction (with being pronounced with a vowel that is as short as in RP) but merge the quality, pronouncing \"hoarse\" longer than \"horse\" .\n\nThe distinction was made in traditional Received Pronunciation as represented in the first and second editions of the Oxford English Dictionary. The IPA symbols used are for \"horse\" and for \"hoarse\". In the online version of the Oxford English Dictionary, and in the planned third edition (on-line entries), the pronunciations of \"horse\" and \"hoarse\" are both given as .\n\nIn British English dialectology, prevocalic in accents that distinguish \"cot\" and \"caught\" is analyzed as + , not , as those non-rhotic dialects that maintain the distinction feature \"two\" vowels that correspond to historic before intervocalic : and –, both of which contrast with . If is considered to be the contemporary reflex of , then the merger is incomplete in the intervocalic position (at least in RP), so that \"moral\" and \"oral\" do not rhyme: (though \"warring\", historically is because it is derived from \"war\" ). Before the loss of rhoticity, \"moral\" and \"war\" had the same stressed vowel: , the latter was then lengthened and raised, merging with : , giving rise to the three-way distinction between prevocalic , and as in \"moral\", \"warring\" and \"oral\" (excluding the marginal , restricted to compounds) due to the derived forms such as \"warring\" (compare the wholly-holy split, which results in creation of a separate phoneme before intervocalic ), though the change did not affect all derived forms, such as \"warrior\" .\n\nThe distinction between intervocalic and (both distinct from as in \"starry\") is stable and it also occurs in Australian English, New Zealand English and South African English, as well as in the majority of regional British English varieties. In Scottish English (which merges \"cot\" with \"caught\"), \"moral\", \"war\" and \"warring\" belong to the class (– + ): (as does \"warrior\" ), whereas \"oral\", \"bore\" and \"boring\" feature (which is + ): . The same applies to the conservative General American varieties that preserve the – distinction.\n\nSome regional non-rhotic British English retains the – distinction (with being distinct from + prevocalic , as in RP). This is the case in e.g. South Wales (excluding Cardiff) and some West Midlands English. is typically the same as , while varies - in those areas of Wales that make the distinction, it merges with the monophthongal variety of : (see toe–tow merger, which those accents lack), whereas in the West Midlands it corresponds to either + : or a separate phoneme: . Which word belongs to which set varies to an extent from region to region, so that speakers from Port Talbot tend to use instead of the etymologically correct in \"forceps\", \"fortress\", \"important\" and \"importance\".\n\nThe cockney distinction between and is not related to the – distinction, which does not exist in that dialect. Instead, it is the split, which gives rise to the phonemic distinction between and in the preconsonantal position, as in \"board\" and \"bored\" as well as \"pause\" and \"paws\" .\n\nIn the United States, the merger, though widespread everywhere, is quite recent in some parts of the country. For example, fieldwork performed in the 1930s by Kurath and McDavid shows the contrast robustly present in the speech of Vermont, northern and western New York State, Virginia, central and southern West Virginia, and North Carolina, plus the whole Atlantic coast (North and South), but by the 1990s telephone surveys conducted by Labov, Ash, and Boberg (2006) show these areas as having completely or almost completely undergone the merger; and even in areas where the distinction is still made, the acoustic difference between the of \"horse\" and the of \"hoarse\" is rather small for many speakers. In Labov et al's 2006 study, a majority of white participants in only these American cities continue to resist the merger: Wilmington, North Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; and Portland, Maine. A 2013 study of Portland, however, found the merger already now established in Portland \"at all age levels\". In Labov et al's study, even St. Louis, Missouri, which traditionally maintained the \"horse\"–\"hoarse\" distinction so strongly that it instead merged \"card\" and \"cord\", showed that only 50% of the participants now continuing to maintain the distinction. The same pattern (a \"horse\"–\"hoarse\" distinction coupled with a \"card\"–\"cord\" merger) also exists in a minority of speakers in Texas and Utah. New Orleans prominently shows much variability regarding this merger, including some speakers with no merger at all. Though African Americans are rapidly undergoing the merger, they are also less likely to do so than white Americans, with a little over half of Labov et al.'s black participants maintaining the merger nationwide.\n\nThe two groups of words merged by this rule are called the lexical sets (including \"horse\") and (including \"hoarse\") by Wells (1982).\n\nSpelling-wise, words with the vowel that are \"not\" spelt with an obviously long vowel spelling are relatively more likely to occur in the following circumstances:\n\nThe merger or \"cheer\"–\"chair\" merger is the merger of the Early Modern English sequences and (and the between them), which is found in some accents of modern English. Many speakers in New Zealand merge them in favor of the vowel, while some speakers in East Anglia and South Carolina merge them in favor of the vowel. The merger is widespread in the Anglophone Caribbean, including Jamaican English.\n\nThis is the merger of as many as five Middle English vowels into one vowel when historically followed by in the coda of a syllable. The merged vowel is in Received Pronunciation, and in American, Canadian, and Irish English. As a result of this merger, the vowels in words like , , and are the same in almost all modern accents of English; the exceptions are Scottish English and some varieties of Irish English. John C. Wells briefly calls this the merger. The three separate vowels are retained by some speakers of Scottish English and what has been called the \"term\"–\"nurse\" merger is resisted by some Irish English speakers, but the full merger is found in almost all other dialects of English.\n\nIn local (working-class) Dublin, the West and South-West Region, and other very conservative and traditional varieties of Irish English, ranging from the south to the north of the island, the typical English phoneme actually retains an opposition as two separate phonemes: and . For example, the words \"earn\" and \"urn\" are not pronounced the same in these varieties. In these traditional accents, this vowel, when after a labial consonant (e.g. \"fern\"), when spelled as \"ur\" or \"or\" (e.g. \"word\"), or when spelled as \"ir\" after an alveolar stop (e.g. \"dirt\") is pronounced as ; in all other situations, this vowel is pronounced as . Example words with include \"certain\" , \"chirp\" , \"circle\" , \"earn\" , \"earth\" , \"girl\" , \"germ\" , \"heard\" or \"herd\" , \"irk\" , and \"tern\" . Example words for include \"bird\" , \"dirt\" , \"first\" , \"murder\" , \"nurse\" , \"turn\" , \"third\" or \"turd\" , \"urn\" , \"work\" , and \"world\" . In non-local (middle- and upper-class) Dublin and in younger and supraregional Irish accents, this opposition is seldom preserved, with both of the phonemes typically merged as , the same as, or similar to, most American accents.\n\nIn Scottish English, a distinct \"nurse\" or \"fur\" vowel is also used in:\nIn Scottish English, a distinct \"term\" or \"fern\" vowel is used in:\n\nSome older varieties of Southern American English and some of England's West Country dialects exhibit a partial merger of '. These dialects generally realise ' as , rhyming with ' (cf. general English realisations of \"cue\" and \"coo\"), so words such as \"beard\" are pronounced as . Usual word pairs like \"beer\" and \"burr\" are still distinguished as vs. . However, drops out after a consonant cluster (e.g. \"queer\") or a palato-alveolar consonant (e.g. \"cheer\"), likely due to phonotactic constraints. This results in a merger with ' in these environments: , . It is thus possible that pairs like \"steer-stir\" are merged in some accents as , although this is not explicitly reported in the literature.\n\nThere is evidence that African American Vernacular English speakers in Memphis, Tennessee merge both and with , so that \"here\" and \"hair\" are both homophonous with the strong pronunciation of \"her\".\n\nThe merger (of words like \"perk\" towards the sound of \"pork\") involves the merger of with that occurs in broadest Geordie.

As a boy he showed a love of the arts and had been employed to draw heads and work devices until Dr. Campbell, a local Physician, having seen some of these works sent some sketches to his friend George Romney. The young Baynes was then sent to London to study under Romney at the expense of Dr. Campbell.\n\nIn 1784, at the age of 18 he became a student at the Royal Academy. He wedded Mary Mann (1766-1845) in 1785 at Marylebone Church, London. Their son, Thomas Mann Baynes (1794-1854), was also a noted watercolour artist.\n\nThe marriage was without the consent of Campbell his patron and this resulted in a loss of support for Baynes and the withdrawal of the opportunity for an Italian tour. Thrown on his own resources he obtained employment from the Polygraphic Society, a Woolwich based company formed for the reproduction of pictures. The company produced reproductions of celebrated works and having touched them up by hand, sold them at a fee. Baynes was to earn £100 a year for this work. The failure of the company lead to his move to Chelsea, followed by moves to 38 Dean Street, Soho, 103 Wardour Street and finally 73 Castle Street near Oxford Street where he remained for 40 years until his death in 1837.\n\nA large proportion of his time was occupied in teaching drawing (in which he had a good practice) and working for architects such as Sir Jeffry Wyattville. Among his pupils were John Wood, who produced a portrait of Baynes, Sir Henry Sass who founded a school of art, \"\"Sass's Academy\"\", in Bloomsbury and J.D. Harding the landscape painter whose name is connected with the advancement of lithography. Baynes's teaching activities and his ever-expanding family (he has eight children) put pressure on his own landscape painting. He was, however, a constant exhibitor of watercolours, and occasionally oils, at the Royal Academy between 1796 and 1837. He specialised in watercolour drawings of Norfolk, North Wales, Cumberland and later, Kent. Frequently he introduced figures and cattle.\n\nBoth James Baynes and his wife were a members of the Sandemanian Church. The Sandemanians were a small, devoted and fundamentalist Christian sect that formed tightknit communities of small congregations across the UK and in Danbury, Connecticut. The London community boasted Michael Faraday amongst its Deacon Elders. In the north of England it is likely that Baynes was a member of one of the Cumbrian branches but on his move to London he made his confession of faith and became a full member of the London congregation (Paul's Alley in the Barbican) in June 1792, some nine months after Michael Faraday's birth.\n\nBaynes drew landscapes while traveling in England and Wales. His sketch books show that he visited the South of England in 1802, Wales and the West of England in 1810, Cumberland in 1815 and Kent in 1816.\n\nJames Baynes died of an 'affection of the heart' on 12 May 1837. Both he and his wife Mary are buried in St. Johns Wood Cemetery, London.\n\nJames Baynes' works include:\n\n\n"}

In its generic name Humboldt and Bonpland honoured Swiss botanist Jacques Denis Choisy (1799–1859).\n\nThe species grow to tall. The leaves are opposite, leathery, glossy, palmately compound with 3-13 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. \"C. ternata\" has three broad leaflets, while \"C. dumosa\" has up to 13 very narrow leaflets. The flowers are star-shaped, diameter, with 4-7 white petals, 8-15 stamens and a green stigma; they are produced throughout the late spring and summer. The fruit is a leathery two to six sectioned capsule.\n\n\"Choisya\" species are popular ornamental plants in areas with mild winters, grown primarily for their abundant and fragrant flowers. The foliage is also aromatic, smelling of rue when bruised or cut. The flowers are also valued for honeybee forage, producing abundant nectar.\n\nThe following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-\n\nMany quinoline alkaloids have been isolated from leaves of \"Choisya ternata\".\"C. ternata\" contains an alkaloid (ternanthranin), a volatile simple anthranilate that can be considered responsible for the antinociceptive activity of the crude plant extracts.\n\n\n\"Choisya\" can be prone to attack by pythium root rot, particularly when propagated and grown in pots for the horticultural trade.

{"id": "1925933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925933", "title": "Lake stratification", "text": "Lake stratification\n\nLake stratification is the separation of lakes into three layers:\n\n\nThe thermal stratification of lakes refers to a change in the temperature at different depths in the lake, and is due to the change in water's density with temperature. Cold water is denser than warm water and the epilimnion generally consists of water that is not as dense as the water in the hypolimnion. However, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater is 4 °C. In temperate regions where lake water warms up and cools through the seasons, a cyclical pattern of overturn occurs that is repeated from year to year as the cold dense water at the top of the lake sinks. For example, in dimictic lakes the lake water turns over during the spring and the fall. This process occurs more slowly in deeper water and as a result, a thermal bar may form. If the stratification of water lasts for extended periods, the lake is meromictic. \n\nIn shallow lakes, stratification into epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion often does not occur, as wind or cooling causes regular mixing throughout the year. These lakes are called polymictic. There is not a fixed depth that separates polymictic and stratifying lakes, as apart from depth, this is also influenced by turbidity, lake surface area, and climate.\n\nThe lake mixing regime (e.g. polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) describes the yearly patterns of lake stratification that occur during most of the years. However, short-term events can influence lake stratification as well. Heat waves can cause periods of stratification in otherwise mixed, shallow lakes, while mixing events such as storms or large river discharge, can break down stratification.\n\nThe accumulation of dissolved carbon dioxide in three meromictic lakes in Africa (Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun in Cameroon and Lake Kivu in Rwanda) is potentially dangerous because if one of these lakes is triggered into limnic eruption, a very large quantity of carbon dioxide can quickly leave the lake and displace the oxygen needed for life by people and animals in the surrounding area.\n\nMany types of aeration equipment have been used to thermally destratify lakes, particularly lakes subject to low oxygen or undesirable algal blooms. In fact, natural resource and environmental managers are often challenged by problems caused by lake and pond thermal stratification. Fish die-offs have been directly associated with thermal gradients, stagnation, and ice cover. Excessive growth of plankton may limit the recreational use of lakes and the commercial use of lake water. With severe thermal stratification in a lake, the quality of drinking water also can be adversely affected. For fisheries managers, the spatial distribution of fish within a lake is often adversely affected by thermal stratification and in some cases may indirectly cause large die-offs of recreationally important fish. One commonly used tool to reduce the severity of these lake management problems is to eliminate or lessen thermal stratification through aeration. Aeration has met with some success, although it has rarely proved to be a panacea.\n\nLake mixing regimes can shift in response to increasing air temperatures. Some dimictic lakes can turn into monomictic lakes, while some monomictic lakes might become meromictic, as a consequence of rising temperatures.\n\nEvery lake has a set mixing regime that is influenced by lake morphometry and environmental conditions. However, human influences in the form of land use change, warming temperatures, and changes to weather patterns have been shown to alter the timing and intensity of stratification in lakes around the globe. These changes can further alter the fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton community composition, in addition to creating gradients that alter the availability of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. \n\nThere are a number of ways in which human land use change influences lake stratification and subsequently water conditions. Urban expansion has led to the construction of roads and houses in close proximity to previously isolated lakes, a factor that has ultimately resulted in increased runoff and pollution. The addition of particulate matter to lake bodies can lower water clarity, resulting in stronger thermal stratification and overall lower average water column temperatures, which can eventually affect the onset of ice cover. Water quality can also be influenced by the runoff of salt from roads and sidewalks, which often creates a benthic saline layer that interferes with vertical mixing of surface waters. Further, the saline layer can prevent dissolved oxygen from reaching the bottom sediments, decreasing Phosphorus recycling and affecting microbial communities.\n\nOn a global scale, rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can also affect stratification in lakes. Rising air temperatures have the same effect on lake bodies as a physical shift in geographic location, with tropical zones being particularly sensitive. The intensity and scope of impact depends on location and lake morphometry, but in some cases can be so extreme as to require a reclassification from monomictic to dimictic (ex Great Bear Lake). Globally, lake stratification appears to be more stable with deeper and steeper thermoclines, and average lake temperature as a main determinant in the stratification response to changing temperatures. Further, surface warming rates are a much higher magnitude than bottom warming rates, again indicating stronger thermal stratification across lakes.\n\nChanges to stratification patterns can also alter the community composition of lake ecosystems. In shallow lakes, temperature increases can alter the diatom community while in deep lakes, the change is reflected in the deep chlorophyll layer taxa. Changes in mixing patterns and increased nutrient availability can also affect zooplankton species composition and abundance, while decreased nutrient availability can be detrimental for benthic communities and fish habitat.\n\n\nAquatic Science\nHypoxia\nFreshwater ecosystems\nWater column\n"}

Byrd in 1926, but it is disputed whether they made it there.\n\nThe \"Bennett\" (DD-473) was launched on 16 April 1942 at the Boston Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. Floyd Bennett, the widow of Aviation Machinist Bennett. She was commissioned on 9 February 1943 with Commander Edmund B. Taylor in command.\n\nThe \"Bennett\" arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 May, and she then spent the next two months patrolling in the Hawaiian Islands. After escorting a convoy to Efate in the New Hebrides, she acted as a plane guard and patrolled out of Efate (27 August through 28 October). Moving to the Solomon Islands 4 November, she patrolled and escorted convoys until 5 April 1944. Included in her service in the Solomon Islands was support of the Cape Torokina, Bougainville landings (on 1 November 1943 on the western side of the island) and Green Island (on 15 February 1944) landings, and bombardments of the Japanese base at Kavieng on New Ireland, (on 18 February 1944) and Rabaul, New Britain (29 February). The \"Bennett\" next steamed north to take part in the invasions of Saipan (14 June through 1 July) and of Guam (2nd through 16 August). Returning to the Central Pacific later in the month she supported the invasion of the Palaus (Peleliu) (6 through 25 September), and then she returned to San Francisco for upkeep work, arriving on 25 October 1944.\n\nThe \"Bennett\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 December, and she remained in Hawaiian waters for the next month. Then she steamed west to take part in the invasion of Iwo Jima (19 February through 5 March 1945), where she was slightly damaged by a dud bomb (1 March). On 1 April she was a unit of the forces taking part in the invasion of Okinawa. At 08:50, on 7 April, she was hit by an Imperial Japanese Navy kamikaze plane, damaging the forward engine room, and knocking out all of her electrical power. Seven sailors ultimately died from their injuries, and fourteen survived serious injuries. The \"Bennett\" was able to make it to the small naval base at Kerama Retto under her own power, and on the following day she departed for Saipan under tow of the fleet tugboat . After emergency repairs, she steamed to Puget Sound Navy Yard where she underwent further repairs (May though August 1945). In August she reported to Adak, in the Aleutian Islands, and then she made one voyage to Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, with weather personnel (28 August through 26 September).

It is produced at the Great Northern Brewery in Dundalk. It is a major lager brand throughout most of Northern Ireland, but is now rarely available in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\"Harp Lager\" was first produced in 1960 as a bottled beer by the Guinness company (now Diageo), in response to the trend among drinkers in Britain and Ireland towards Continental lager. Guinness converted its Dundalk brewery into a modern lager production plant with the guidance of Dr. Herman Muender, a distinguished German brewer. Various names were considered for the brand, including \"Atlas\", \"Cresta\" and \"Dolphin\", before \"Harp\" was chosen. The brand was marketed with the Brian Boru harp as its emblem.\n\nBy 1961 a consortium of brewers, Courage, Barclay & Simonds, Scottish & Newcastle, Bass, Mitchells & Butlers and Guinness, grouped together as Harp Lager Ltd to brew and market the beer. Courage's Alton Brewery, where \"Courage Director's\" had been brewed, was rebuilt to produce the lager in Great Britain.\n\nBy 1964, the product was being sold on draught and led in its category for sales. Members of the Harp consortium changed over the years, with Courage and Scottish & Newcastle leaving in 1979, but becoming franchisees. Currently available on draught, and in 330ml and 500ml bottles, its top market is Ulster, especially Northern Ireland and County Donegal. In 2005, Harp saw a makeover as Diageo Ireland separated the brand from Guinness.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, Diageo Ireland announced that it would close the Dundalk Brewery along with the Kilkenny Brewery over a five-year period. The last Harp was brewed at Great Northern in October 2013, after which production moved to Diageo's sole Irish brewery, St James's Gate Brewery in St. James's Gate, Dublin.\n\nToday, \"Harp\" is brewed in the Dublin brewery for Ireland and Hydes Brewery for Great Britain.

It was also released on the SNES in 1993, under the name Super Putty in North America and Europe and as in Japan. A release on the Commodore Amiga CD32 was made in 1994, also under the name Super Putty. Despite the extra buttons present on the CD32's controller, the CD32 version made no use of them.\n\nThe game received positive reviews upon release, notably for the Amiga version.\n\nPutty Moon, the place where Putty lives, has been taken over by an evil wizard named Dazzledaze. Dazzledaze planned to capture the Putties and ship them to Earth as gum. To save his friends and oust the evil wizard, Billy Putty enlists the help of some robots (\"bots\") to build a skyscraper that will reach up to Putty Moon.\n\nIn \"Putty\", the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a \"smart bomb\", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.\n\nPutty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.\n\nPutty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.\n\nA final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.\n\nThe levels in \"Putty\" are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as \"solid\" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads.\n\nThe aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death.\n\nInvariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb.\n\nPutty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ named Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze.\n\nThe sequel \"Putty Squad\" was initially only released for Super NES and only in PAL territories. It features Putty fighting alongside nemesis Dweezil the cat against other mischievous enemies to rescue other red putties. It also features a two-player mode, with the second player taking control of a red putty. Versions of the game were completed and reviewed, but not published, for the Amiga and the Sega Mega Drive, with only a demo version for the Amiga being released on two magazine coverdisks. The complete Amiga version was finally released in December 2013 as a free Christmas gift from System 3, available on their website. The Mega Drive version was also released in October 2015 by a Sega-16 user who get hold of a working prototype. A PC MS-DOS version was also projected by System 3 and a demo version was released on magazine disks, but in the end this version was not even finished by the developer.\n\nOverall, the original version received favourable reviews and scored highly among many Amiga reviewers.\n\nOn August 12, 2010, System 3 announced that a new version of \"Putty Squad\" will be available on PS3, iPhone, iPad and PSP. The game was eventually released for PSVita, PS4, PS3, 3DS, Windows 8 and Xbox Live Arcade. The remake received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\n\nIn Retro Gamer issue 39 Mark Cale stated that he would be bringing the \"Putty\" series to the Nintendo DS and PSP in 2008 and more details would be announced later in 2008. He stated that System 3 were looking to bring a new game to the systems rather than a port of the two existing games. However, the games were never released or revealed.\n\n"}

Although the two buildings have been physically connected since 1914, they were built separately. They were jointly added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 under the name Military Drill Hall and Men's Gymnasium.\n\nThe one-story building now known as the Kenney Gym Annex, the easternmost of the two structures, was built in 1889-90 as the Military Drill Hall and was designed by Nathan Clifford Ricker. The interior was converted for use as a gymnasium in 1914, at which time it became known as the Annex to the Men's Gym building next to it. The conversion preserved the building's large column-free open space, which had been a necessity for military drilling. An eastern addition was made to the building in 1918.\n\nThe Kenney Gym, the two-story building to the west, was built in 1902 and was designed by Nelson Strong Spencer in the Renaissance Revival style, strongly influenced by Ricker's design for the drill hall. It was originally called the Men's Gymnasium but was renamed the Men's Old Gym when Huff Hall opened in 1925. In 1974, it was named after Harold Eugene \"Hek\" Kenney, a former UIUC wrestler, coach, and administrator in the early 20th century.\n\nPrior to the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It was also home to the women's volleyball program from 1974 until 1989 and the men's wrestling team until those teams moved to Huff Hall.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1925, Kenney Gym played host to the state finals of the Illinois High School Association boys' basketball tournament.\n\nKenney Gym Annex is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena which is the practice facility for the Fighting Illini men's and women's gymnastics teams. \n\nThe building is also used by University Laboratory High School in Urbana, located two blocks east of Kenney Gym on Springfield Avenue, as their gym for high school volleyball and basketball, along with their physical education program.\n\nNotes\n\n"}

The exact number of operatives was classified but was thought to be between 60 and 80, with an average age of 31. SSG could have been deployed to achieve specific, well-defined and often time critical results of strategic or operational significance which couldn't have been achieved through the use of conventional forces. Typical missions undertaken by SSG were to engage and destroy targets of great significance to the enemy, to rescue people captured by the enemy or held hostage, and to gather intelligence through combat. SSG's missions required its operators to covertly infiltrate and move inside hostile territory and remain undetected for very long periods.\n\nIn 1994 the \"Särskilda Skyddsgruppen\" (Special Protection Group, SSG) unit was founded, though the unit's existence wasn't made public until 1997. \nThere were several reasons why the SSG was formed: one was the threat of foreign special forces, which intended to kill the senior military and civilian officials (for example politicians). The SSG was designed to perform operations which existing military regiments did not have the skills to carry out. The other was that in the early 1990s the missions of the Swedish Army were much more complex and sensitive than before.\n\nIn 2002, Afghanistan, the SSG contributed to security and personal protection of the Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, returning from exile in Italy. The SSG along with other Special Operations Forces also trained Afghan military personnel.\n\nIn November 2003, SSG along with FJS/IK (Para Ranger Rapid Reaction Company, later SIG) were sent to Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), with members of French special forces CPA10 and 1er RPIMa for Operation Artemis. The mission was to stabilize the situation in the area around the town of Bunia and to stop the killing. Shortly after Operation Artemis, a new unit, \"Särskilda Inhämtningsgruppen\" (Special Reconnaissance Group, SIG) was founded out of the FJS/IK whose object was information gathering.\n\nOn March 17–18, 2004, during the riots in Caglavica near Pristina in Kosovo, SSG operators conducted counter sniper operations. More than 30 SVD Dragunov sniper rifles were recovered in one hour after deputy battalion commander had granted them \"every permission to fire in all of Kosovo\".\n\nOn November 25, 2005, four SSG operatives were wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) during a reconnaissance mission in northern Afghanistan. Of the wounded, Jesper Lindblom died due to his injuries on December 9, 2005 and Thomas Bergqvist died after having been airlifted to a hospital in Europe.\n\nIn 2008, SSG and SIG were deployed to Chad, to prepare for the Swedish contribution of marines to EUFOR.\n\nIn 2011, the SSG and SIG were merged to create the Särskilda operationsgruppen (Special Operations Group, SOG).\n\nSSG drew its personnel from officers (lower ranks might have undergone officer training to be able to serve in the unit) of all three branches of the military, however mainly from Life Regiment Hussars (K 3) (Airborne & Reconnaissance Infantry), Kustjägarna (Marine Rangers), Army Ranger Battalion and each applicant must have passed a two-week-long grueling selection process. Before selection took place, the applicants were invited to attend a pre-selection weekend, where they would have been tested and given notice of the likelihood of failure or success and how to improve themselves. Selection might only have been attempted once unless there were certain mitigating circumstances that caused the applicant to fail.\n\nBecause of its level of secrecy, the time it took to train a recruit had not been made public by the SSG but according to the armed forces´ website, basic operator training took more than one year. Each soldier received common training including parachuting, scuba diving and protection. As an operative he would have also received special training within different areas such as HAHO/HALO parachuting, explosives, first aid, sniping and special weapons training. An SSG operative had the ability to insert and extract by several means such as on foot, paradrop, submerged, and by boat and vehicle.\n\nWomen could have applied to the unit as Intelligence Operators.\n\nTraining was often held in countries other than Sweden, and joint exercises with other countries special forces were frequent.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1925975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1925975", "title": "Southdale Center", "text": "Southdale Center\n\nSouthdale Center is a shopping mall located in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of the Twin Cities. It opened in 1956 and is both the first and the oldest fully enclosed, climate-controlled shopping mall in the United States. Southdale Center comprises of leasable retail space, and contains 106 retail tenants. The mall is owned by Simon Property Group and is anchored by Macy's and Life Time Athletic.\n\nVictor Gruen, the center's architect, designed the mall to challenge the \"car-centric\" America that was rising in the 1950s. Since its opening in 1956, Southdale has suffered through high vacancy rates and several store closures, but has been able to recover in recent years. Several additions have been performed on the building, including a 2011 renovation which involved the construction of a brand new food court. Southdale Center continues to use much of its original structure despite these renovations, and has been the host of several charity and community events throughout the years.\n\nSouthdale Center was developed by the Dayton Company and designed by Victor Gruen, an Austrian immigrant and socialist. Gruen was a European-style socialist; he found individual stores in downtown venues to be inefficient, and the suburban lifestyle of 1950s America too \"car-centric\" and wanted to design a building that would be a communal gathering place, where people would shop, drink coffee, and socialize, as he remembered from his native Vienna. Southdale Center was loosely modeled on the arcades of several heavily populated European cities and purposely included \"eye-level display cases\" to \"lure customers into stores\". Gruen imaged that Southdale would eventually include \"a medical center, schools and residences, not just a parade of glitzy stores.\" The first plans unveiled for the shopping center were announced in 1952 by Gruen and Minnesota native, Donald Dayton.\n\nGroundbreaking for Southdale took place on October 29, 1954; 800 construction workers were needed to build the three-story, , 500 acre center, which had 5,200 parking spaces, 72 available tenants, and cost $20 million to construct. Due to Minnesota's harsh climate in the winter, Gruen constructed the center with a roof and air-conditioning system capable of maintaining a comfortable temperature of year-round. The mall was originally anchored by Dayton's, Donaldson's, Walgreens, and Woolworth, the first of which also developed the center. Over 40,000 visitors attended the grand opening ceremony for the center on the morning of October 8, 1956. An additional 188,000 customers visited the mall throughout the following week.\n\nThe center was constructed to successfully bring the community together by \"gathering art, culture and entertainment under one roof with retail.\" The Dayton's store was modeled after Dayton's flagship store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In November 1956, organic architect Frank Lloyd Wright visited the mall as part of a tour of new buildings in Minnesota; he critiqued Southdale's overall design, stating \"[the] garden court has all the evils of the village street and none of its charm,\" further criticizing several other buildings in nearby Minneapolis. He unfavorably added that Gruen \"should have left downtown, downtown.\"\n\nOver the early years of Southdale, several tenants and restaurants opened in the center. A restaurant called Sidewalk Cafe, was an \"outdoor\"-themed restaurant, even though the venue was fully enclosed; Sidewalk Cafe was the first restaurant of its kind. JCPenney, a Plano, Texas-based department store, announced their interest in opening a location at Southdale Center. An addition to the mall was constructed, allowing JCPenney to open a store in 1972; it became Southdale's third anchor store, following Dayton's and Donaldson's.\nAlong with the new anchor store came an entire new mall corridor connecting JCPenney to the original structure of the mall.\n\nDuring 1976, construction of a new shopping center directly across the street from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the Galleria Edina, an upscale shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring shopping centers. In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain of stores, which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott.\n\nIn 1991, Dayton's announced plans to construct a significantly larger store directly north of their current location. These plans included the demolition of the original Dayton's store to be replaced with more stores, plus a larger \"garden court\", and the construction of various multi-level parking garages; these plans were eventually constructed and finalized in the early 1990s. On June 30, 1997, Southdale Center was sold to the O'Connor Group, a New York-based real estate company for $125 million. Around this time, Southdale converted their basement into a singular anchor store, which became Marshalls; surrounding the new anchor were several specialty shops and mall management offices. Dayton's became Marshall Field's in 2001.\nDuring the early 2000s, following fear of competition from nearby Eden Prairie Center and Mall of America, Southdale announced further plans to renovate the center again. A complete remodeling of the center occurred in 2001, followed by a large addition to the southern half of the property; the addition included a sixteen screen movie theater along with an entertainment district of restaurants and shops called \"The District on France\". \"The District on France\" included several \"upscale\" dining options, including California Pizza Kitchen, The Cheesecake Factory, and Maggiano's Little Italy.<ref name=\"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 3\"></ref><ref name=\"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 4\"></ref> A renovation of the less-traveled third floor also occurred, with the addition of teen-geared stores; this addition was called \"Trendz on Top\".\n\nThroughout the mid 2000s, Southdale began struggling with maintaining a low vacancy rate. Mervyn's, one of Southdale's four anchors, announced that they had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would in turn close all of their Minnesota locations. After the closure of Mervyn's in 2004, several tenants followed and ended their leases as well; national retailers like The Bombay Company, Crate & Barrel, Ritz Camera, and Select Comfort all announced closures of their Southdale locations.<ref name=\"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 5\"></ref> Talks of a Dick's Sporting Goods filling the space formerly leased by Mervyn's occurred, but those plans never took off and eventually dissolved. In 2006, Marshall Fields became Macy's.\n\nIn February 2011, Simon Property Group announced that Southdale would soon be anchored by Herberger's, a local department store chain, and would lease the space previously used by Mervyn's. Along with this announcement came the mention of a brand new food court to replace the nearly vacant one on the less-traveled third floor, a housing development consisting of apartments and condominiums, and expanded retail. The food court's construction would include six tenants, which was later increased to eight tenants. However, the new food court forced the closure of one of Southdale's oldest tenants, Ralph's Shoe Service, which originally opened at the mall in 1957. Following several tenant terminations, the mall's Marshalls anchor announced that their Southdale location would move to a different shopping center in Bloomington, Minnesota.<ref name=\"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 6\"></ref>\n\nThe new food court located by JCPenney was completed in 2012 and featured \"upscale\" dining options, such as Qdoba Mexican Grill and Smashburger; several other projects took place, such as cosmetic changes for the mall and the construction of new corridors. Since 2015, several stores and businesses have opened up locations at Southdale Center. Gordmans, a Nebraska-based discount retailer, filled the vacancy previous leased by Marshalls in July 2015, followed by the opening of a Dave and Buster's restaurant, filling the vacancy of the original food court. A Homewood Suites by Hilton resort was approved by the City of Edina and will be constructed in the shopping center's northeast parking lot in late 2016.<ref name=\"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 1\"></ref>\n\nOf the six Gordmans stores located in Minnesota, the chain issued a press release in April 2017 stating that five of them would close in 2017; additionally, 48 out of their 98 locations nationwide would close. The Southdale location was expected to close soon after the release. Following the announcement of JCPenney closing nine stores throughout Minnesota, the Southdale Center location was listed as one of them on June 2, 2017. It closed on July 31, 2017. It will be replaced by a Life Time Fitness and additional retail tenants.<ref name=\"Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal 7\"></ref>\n\nBon-Ton announced on April 17, 2018 that it would close and begin liquidating all Herberger's stores and all 200+ locations after two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company. This included the Southdale location. According to national retail reporter Mitch Nolen, stores would close within 10 to 12 weeks.\n\nOn August 26, 2018, the Herberger's location closed.\n\nIn May 2019, it was announced that the Southdale branch of the Hennepin County Library will move to Southdale Center, taking the place of the vacant Herberger's. An opening date is set for 2022.\n\nOn March 18, 2020, Southdale temporarily closed until March 29, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n"}

They won the Eurovision Song Contest 1985 with the song \"La det swinge\" (\"Let it swing\").\n\nThe duo was formed in 1983. Both Krogh and Andreassen were frequent Eurovision contestants. Krogh has appeared three times, all for Norway - in 1971 as a soloist, with Bobbysocks! in 1985 and as part of Just 4 Fun in 1991. Andreassen sang for Sweden as one half of Chips in 1982 and after winning with Bobbysocks, teamed up with Jan Werner Danielsen in 1994 and sang solo in 1996. According to John Kennedy O'Connor's \"The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History\" Andreassen is one of only five lead artists to sing in the contest on four occasions and is also one of only four artists to finish both first and second in Eurovision (1985 & 1996).\n\nThe duo's debut single was \"I Don't Wanna Break My Heart\" (1984), released in a pink colored vinyl. The concept behind Bobbysocks! was to bring up to date songs from the 1950s with a swing mood, adding them a \"modern\" 1980s sound. That idea was fully applied on their first LP \"Bobbysocks!\", which was a mixture of covers and brand new songs.\n\nThe scheduled next single was going to be \"Radio\", but the plans were changed when the duo won the Eurovision Song Contest. \"Let It Swing\" topped the Norwegian singles chart, as well as it did in Belgium. It was a Top 10 in Sweden and Ireland, and a Top 20 in The Netherlands and Austria. It entered the UK singles charts on 25 May 1985, and rose to a high of Nº 44; it remained in the charts for 4 weeks. It was also pressed in countries such as Germany, Japan and Australia. There were plans to release the single in USA, but it didn't happen at the end.\n\nIn 1985, due to their ESC victory, Bobbysocks! were awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, which is awarded by the Stortinget, Norway's parliament.\n\nAnother ESC consequence was the re-release of the \"Bobbysocks!\" LP with \"Let It Swing\" on it, reaching the Gold status. Their next album, \"Waiting for the Morning\", was released in April 1986, preceded by the single of the same name, both becoming a huge success in Norway, peaking at Nº 1 on the Norwegian singles and album charts. \"Walkin' on Air\", was recorded in L.A. in 1987 and produced by Bill Maxwell. It went Gold in only 4 days, becoming their 3rd and final LP. Just before the release of \"If I Fall\", the album's lead single in Norway, the duo wanted to do something \"decently crazy\" as they revealed at the time, so they did a cover of \"Swing it, magister'n\", a song from 1940 originally sung by the Swedish singer and actress Alice Babs, releasing it as single in the summer of 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Bobbysocks disbanded, after 4 successful years. However, Krogh and Andreassen still appeared time to time together on stage in Norway. They appeared at \"Congratulations\", the 50th anniversary Eurovision concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 2005.\n\nDuring May 2010, Bobbysocks did a short comeback to celebrate their 25th anniversary since their ESC victory in 1985, launching a compilation album called \"Let It Swing - The Best Of Bobbysocks!\", which included 2 newly recorded songs and peaking at Nº 13 on the Norwegian album charts, helping to gain brand new fans not only in Norway, but also in other countries all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n "}

Lake Nipigon is located approximately north of Nipigon. \n\nNipigon is served by several transportation corridors:\n\n\nFor about 15 km, Highway 11 runs within Nipigon River and a lake. Nipigon is located northeast of Thunder Bay, southwest of Geraldton and Beardmore, west of Marathon and northwest of Sault Ste. Marie. The crater on Mars named Nipigon Crater or Crater Nipigon is named after this town.\n\nNipigon is surrounded with pine and other varieties of forests. The power line connecting from Lake Nipigon supplies electricity to Thunder Bay and area. The other power line runs between Thunder Bay and the rest of Ontario. Timbering has been common sporadically to the north, the northwest and further north within Lake Nipigon along with parts of the southwest which formed old forest roads to the northeast and north. The municipality of Greenstone lies to the north. A manufacturing plant lies to the south. Several other unincorporated municipalities were around Nipigon. A communications tower near Nipigon broadcasts a local radio station and television channels from Thunder Bay including CKPR (TBT), CFNO and CBQT.\n\nThere are two bridges at the east end of town spanning the Nipigon River: one is a single-track railway bridge belonging to the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the other is a two-lane highway bridge constructed by the Province of Ontario. With the exception of the Canadian National Railway transcontinental rail line, the two bridges are the narrowest east-west land link in Canada's transportation system. Both Highways 11 and 17 and the Canadian Pacific Railway route all their traffic across those bridges. \n\nThe Nipigon River Bridge is being replaced by a pair of two-lane cable-stayed bridges, the first of their kind in Ontario, with the future eastbound bridge having been finished in November 2015 and the second, westbound bridge, to be completed by 2018. On January 10, 2016, the first bridge heaved apart but did not collapse, resulting in traffic having to reroute through the United States. However, one lane was re-opened to traffic 17 hours later.\n\nThe chief industries in Nipigon are forest products, fishing, and tourism. \n\nNipigon is a setting off point for fishing excursions onto Lake Superior and the Nipigon River system leading up to Lake Nipigon. Fish varieties common to this area include Atlantic salmon, lake trout, speckled trout (the world's largest speckled trout was caught in the Nipigon River in 1915, weighing in at ), rainbow trout, walleye, northern pike, bass, and perch.\n\nOn February 6, 2007, a devastating fire ripped through Multiply Forest Products, burning the mill to the ground.\nThe mill was the main employer in the town. Less than a month earlier workers at the mill had purchased it from Columbia Forest Products of Portland, Oregon. At the time of the sale, a $4-million modernization plan for the mill was also announced. More than 100 people were employed at the plant, which produced hardwood underlayment for vinyl, plywood and laminate flooring.\n\nNipigon was the birthplace of two time world curling champion Allan A. \"Al\" (the Iceman) Hackner. Hackner won The Brier in 1982 and 1985.\n\n\n"}

The album features John Dieterich of Deerhoof and Devin Hoff as contributors.\n\n\"La Forêt's\" sound has been described as more subtle and less pop sounding than Xiu Xiu's previous album \"Fabulous Muscles.\" The album was seen as a return to the band’s earlier sound.\n\nThe instrumentation includes clarinet, string arrangements, and vibraphone. Stewart said the tone of the album reflected his personal life where he began to internalize the difficult events that occurred around when \"Fabulous Muscles\" was recorded. He described the album as \"about reflection and resignation and coming to a sort of resolution\".\n\nJamie Stewart described five main subjects of Xiu Xiu songs: family, politics, sex, love and lovelessness, and suicide. The song \"Bog People\" is about family and loss, and was written late at night while Stewart was in a bout of sadness and loneliness during a thunderstorm. The track \"Saturn\" is based on Francisco Goya's \"Saturn Devouring His Son\" and \"wanting to rape\" then-President George W. Bush \"to death\". Stewart had seen the former at the Prado during the 2004 U.S. presidential elections.\n\n\"La Forêt\" received critical acclaim.

Fields gave the album a grade of \"A-,\" writing \"\"La Forêt\" has the sort of courage-minus-contrivance that is exceedingly (and ironically) rare in music of its dramatic and thematic ilk. For this reason, though I have enjoyed and admired many records this year, this is one of the few I genuinely care about.\" Jordan Dowling of Drowned in Sound also gave the album a positive review, writing \"Easy listening this amn't, but if you want a rollercoaster ride into deep recessions and to be thrilled by the sounds that surround you, then this could be the perfect album for you.\" Allmusic's Heather Phares wrote \"\"La Foret\" may be more delicate and less immediate than some of Xiu Xiu's other work (especially \"Fabulous Muscles\"), but at its best, it may have even more impact because of that.\"\n\nJoe Darling of Delusions of Adequacy, on the other hand, gave the album a negative review, writing \"Unfortunately, the mere manufacture of unique sounds isn’t enough to rescue them on \"La Forêt\". If Xiu Xiu would only come to a greater understanding of its own volatility, the band would be enabled to create truly memorable compositions. Hopefully these folks will reach this realization before they become completely entangled by devices of their own resistance.\"\n\nBrandon Stosuy of \"Pitchfork\" described the album as \"less jagged, more elegant\" than previous albums, and subtler than \"Fabulous Muscles\".\n\nThe following people contributed to \"La Forêt:\"\n\n\n"}

In 1936, at the peak of the Arab revolt and the 1936–1939 pogroms he joined the Haganah in order to help protect the Jews from Arab rioters.\n\nWith the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Tzur was appointed battalion leader in the Givati Brigade, and participated in Operation Pleshet, among others. Tzur was the founder of the fast jeep reconnaissance company, Samson's Foxes, which fought on the southern front. After the end of the war, he undertook organizing roles and went to study manpower management in the United States.\n\nIn 1956 he was promoted to the rank of Major General and was appointed as the commander of the central front. In 1958 he was appointed as deputy chief of staff and went for long period of study in France. He returned on September 1960. The following year he replaced Haim Laskov as the IDF chief of staff.\n\nIn January 1961 Tzur was appointed as the IDF Chief of Staff. One of his first actions was to appoint Major General Yitzhak Rabin as his deputy. Tzur's term was relatively quiet, except for border incidents with Syria, which shelled Israeli villages from the Golan Heights. The biggest IDF operation during Tzur's term was held on 16 March 1962, when the Golani Brigade raided Syrian outposts to the north of the Sea of Galilee in order to stop Syrian shelling. Seven Israeli soldiers and thirty Syrian soldiers were killed during the battle. However, the shelling was not stopped in the area and on 19 August 1963, Syrian forces murdered two civilians in Almagor.\n\nTzur sought to draw quality manpower to the IDF and decided in June 1961 to provide officers with a private car for their personal usage. The model chosen was a Citroën 2CV.\n\nTzur also prepared the IDF for a war with the Arab armies and built up the defense forces so that it could stop Arab attacks. In August 1961, the president of Egypt, Gamal Abdul Nasser, revealed that Israel had obtained Dassault Mirage III jet fighters in order to counter Egyptian Soviet-made MiG-19s. The Mirages proven themselves very well and served as the Israeli Air Force's main fighter for many years. The Mirages contributed substantially to Israel's victory in the Six-Day War and the elimination of the combined Arab airpower of Egypt, Syria and Jordan, as did other two notable acquisitions by Tzur, the Centurion tanks and MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile technology.\n\nTzur retired from duty in December 1963.\n\nAfter his retirement Tzur was appointed as the general manager of Mekorot, Israel's national water company. Under pressure from Moshe Dayan to enter the political fray, in the 1965 elections he was elected to the Knesset on the Rafi list, David Ben-Gurion's party. However, he resigned from the Knesset after just a month, and was replaced by Amos Degani, before returning to work in Mekorot.\n\nWith the appointment of Dayan as Minister of Defense in May 1967, Tzur was asked to assist Dayan and served as an adviser to the Minister of Defense for seven years.\n\nAfter that, Tzur served at several managing positions, including the Israeli Aircraft Industries, the shipping company Zim, and \"Hevra LeYsrael\".\n\nTzur was active in public affairs until his last days, and on 29 April 2004 he signed a letter in support of Ariel Sharon's disengament plan. He died in December that year.\n"}

{"id": "1926015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926015", "title": "Electron paramagnetic resonance", "text": "Electron paramagnetic resonance\n\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) or electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy\nis a method for studying materials with unpaired electrons. The basic concepts of EPR are analogous to those of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but it is electron spins that are excited instead of the spins of atomic nuclei. EPR spectroscopy is particularly useful for studying metal complexes or organic radicals.\nEPR was first observed in Kazan State University by Soviet physicist Yevgeny Zavoisky in 1944, and was developed independently at the same time by Brebis Bleaney at the University of Oxford.\n\nEvery electron has a magnetic moment and spin quantum number formula_1, with magnetic components formula_2 or formula_3. In the presence of an external magnetic field with strength formula_4, the electron's magnetic moment aligns itself either antiparallel (formula_3) or parallel (formula_2) to the field, each alignment having a specific energy due to the Zeeman effect:\n\nwhere\n\nTherefore, the separation between the lower and the upper state is formula_11 for unpaired free electrons. This equation implies (since both formula_8and formula_10 are constant) that the splitting of the energy levels is directly proportional to the magnetic field's strength, as shown in the diagram below.\nAn unpaired electron can move between the two energy levels by either absorbing or emitting a photon of energy formula_14 such that the resonance condition, formula_15, is obeyed. This leads to the fundamental equation of EPR spectroscopy: formula_16.\n\nExperimentally, this equation permits a large combination of frequency and magnetic field values, but the great majority of EPR measurements are made with microwaves in the 9000–10000 MHz (9–10 GHz) region, with fields corresponding to about 3500 G (0.35 T). Furthermore, EPR spectra can be generated by either varying the photon frequency incident on a sample while holding the magnetic field constant or doing the reverse. In practice, it is usually the frequency that is kept fixed. A collection of paramagnetic centers, such as free radicals, is exposed to microwaves at a fixed frequency. By increasing an external magnetic field, the gap between the formula_2 and formula_3 energy states is widened until it matches the energy of the microwaves, as represented by the double arrow in the diagram above. At this point the unpaired electrons can move between their two spin states. Since there typically are more electrons in the lower state, due to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution (see below), there is a net absorption of energy, and it is this absorption that is monitored and converted into a spectrum. The upper spectrum below is the simulated absorption for a system of free electrons in a varying magnetic field. The lower spectrum is the first derivative of the absorption spectrum. The latter is the most common way to record and publish continuous wave EPR spectra.\n\nFor the microwave frequency of 9388.2 MHz, the predicted resonance occurs at a magnetic field of about formula_19 = 0.3350 T = 3350 G\n\nBecause of electron-nuclear mass differences, the magnetic moment of an electron is substantially larger than the corresponding quantity for any nucleus, so that a much higher electromagnetic frequency is needed to bring about a spin resonance with an electron than with a nucleus, at identical magnetic field strengths. For example, for the field of 3350 G shown above, spin resonance occurs near 9388.2 MHz for an electron compared to only about 14.3 MHz for H nuclei. (For NMR spectroscopy, the corresponding resonance equation is formula_20 where formula_21 and formula_22 depend on the nucleus under study.)\n\nAs previously mentioned an EPR spectrum is usually directly measured as the first derivative of the absorption. This is accomplished by using field modulation. A small additional oscillating magnetic field is applied to the external magnetic field at a typical frequency of 100 kHz. By detecting the peak to peak amplitude the first derivative of the absorption is measured. By using phase sensitive detection only signals with the same modulation (100 kHz) are detected. This results in higher signal to noise ratios. Note field modulation is unique to continuous wave EPR measurements and spectra resulting from pulsed experiments are presented as absorption profiles.\n\nIn practice, EPR samples consist of collections of many paramagnetic species, and not single isolated paramagnetic centers. If the population of radicals is in thermodynamic equilibrium, its statistical distribution is described by the Maxwell–Boltzmann equation:\n\nwhere formula_24 is the number of paramagnetic centers occupying the upper energy state, formula_25 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_26 is the thermodynamic temperature. At 298 K, X-band microwave frequencies (formula_27 ≈ 9.75 GHz) give formula_28 ≈ 0.998, meaning that the upper energy level has a slightly smaller population than the lower one. Therefore, transitions from the lower to the higher level are more probable than the reverse, which is why there is a net absorption of energy.\n\nThe sensitivity of the EPR method (i.e., the minimal number of detectable spins formula_29) depends on the photon frequency formula_27 according to\n\nwhere formula_32 is a constant, formula_33 is the sample's volume, formula_34 is the unloaded quality factor of the microwave cavity (sample chamber), formula_35 is the cavity filling coefficient, and formula_36 is the microwave power in the spectrometer cavity. With formula_35 and formula_36 being constants, formula_29 ~ formula_40, i.e., formula_29 ~ formula_42, where formula_43 ≈ 1.5. In practice, formula_43 can change varying from 0.5 to 4.5 depending on spectrometer characteristics, resonance conditions, and sample size.\n\nA great sensitivity is therefore obtained with a low detection limit formula_29 and a large number of spins. Therefore, the required parameters are:\n\nIn real systems, electrons are normally not solitary, but are associated with one or more atoms. There are several important consequences of this:\n\nKnowledge of the \"g\"-factor can give information about a paramagnetic center's electronic structure. An unpaired electron responds not only to a spectrometer's applied magnetic field formula_47 but also to any local magnetic fields of atoms or molecules. The effective field formula_48 experienced by an electron is thus written\n\nwhere formula_50 includes the effects of local fields (formula_51 can be positive or negative). Therefore, the formula_52 resonance condition (above) is rewritten as follows:\n\nThe quantity formula_54 is denoted formula_55 and called simply the \"g\"-factor, so that the final resonance equation becomes\n\nThis last equation is used to determine formula_55 in an EPR experiment by measuring the field and the frequency at which resonance occurs. If formula_55 does not equal formula_8, the implication is that the ratio of the unpaired electron's spin magnetic moment to its angular momentum differs from the free-electron value. Since an electron's spin magnetic moment is constant (approximately the Bohr magneton), then the electron must have gained or lost angular momentum through spin–orbit coupling. Because the mechanisms of spin–orbit coupling are well understood, the magnitude of the change gives information about the nature of the atomic or molecular orbital containing the unpaired electron.\n\nIn general, the \"g\" factor is not a number but a second-rank tensor represented by 9 numbers arranged in a 3×3 matrix. The principal axes of this tensor are determined by the local fields, for example, by the local atomic arrangement around the unpaired spin in a solid or in a molecule. Choosing an appropriate coordinate system (say, \"x\",\"y\",\"z\") allows one to \"diagonalize\" this tensor, thereby reducing the maximal number of its components from 9 to 3: \"g\", \"g\" and \"g\". For a single spin experiencing only Zeeman interaction with an external magnetic field, the position of the EPR resonance is given by the expression \"gB\" + \"gB\" + \"gB\". Here \"B\", \"B\" and \"B\" are the components of the magnetic field vector in the coordinate system (\"x\",\"y\",\"z\"); their magnitudes change as the field is rotated, so does the frequency of the resonance. For a large ensemble of randomly oriented spins, the EPR spectrum consists of three peaks of characteristic shape at frequencies \"gB\", \"gB\" and \"gB\": the low-frequency peak is positive in first-derivative spectra, the high-frequency peak is negative, and the central peak is bipolar. Such situations are commonly observed in powders, and the spectra are therefore called \"powder-pattern spectra\". In crystals, the number of EPR lines is determined by the number of crystallographically equivalent orientations of the EPR spin (called \"EPR center\").\n\nSince the source of an EPR spectrum is a change in an electron's spin state, the EPR spectrum for a radical (S = 1/2 system) would consist of one line. Greater complexity arises because the spin couples with nearby nuclear spins. The magnitude of the coupling is proportional to the magnetic moment of the coupled nuclei and depends on the mechanism of the coupling. Coupling is mediated by two processes, dipolar (through space) and isotropic (through bond).\n\nThis coupling introduces additional energy states and, in turn, multi-lined spectra. In such cases, the spacing between the EPR spectral lines indicates the degree of interaction between the unpaired electron and the perturbing nuclei. The hyperfine coupling constant of a nucleus is directly related to the spectral line spacing and, in the simplest cases, is essentially the spacing itself. \n\nTwo common mechanisms by which electrons and nuclei interact are the Fermi contact interaction and by dipolar interaction. The former applies largely to the case of isotropic interactions (independent of sample orientation in a magnetic field) and the latter to the case of anisotropic interactions (spectra dependent on sample orientation in a magnetic field). Spin polarization is a third mechanism for interactions between an unpaired electron and a nuclear spin, being especially important for formula_60-electron organic radicals, such as the benzene radical anion. The symbols \"\"a\"\" or \"\"A\"\" are used for isotropic hyperfine coupling constants, while \"\"B\"\" is usually employed for anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants.\n\nIn many cases, the isotropic hyperfine splitting pattern for a radical freely tumbling in a solution (isotropic system) can be predicted.\n\n\n\nWhile it is easy to predict the number of lines, the reverse problem, unraveling a complex multi-line EPR spectrum and assigning the various spacings to specific nuclei, is more difficult.\n\nIn the often encountered case of \"I\" = 1/2 nuclei (e.g., H, F, P), the line intensities produced by a population of radicals, each possessing \"M\" equivalent nuclei, will follow Pascal's triangle. For example, the spectrum at the right shows that the three H nuclei of the CH radical give rise to 2\"MI\" + 1 = 2(3)(1/2) + 1 = 4 lines with a 1:3:3:1 ratio. The line spacing gives a hyperfine coupling constant of \"a\" = 23 \"G\" for each of the three H nuclei. Note again that the lines in this spectrum are \"first derivatives\" of absorptions.\nAs a second example, the methoxymethyl radical, HCOCH the OC\"H\" center will give an overall 1:2:1 EPR pattern, each component of which is further split by the three methoxy hydrogens into a 1:3:3:1 pattern to give a total of 3×4 = 12 lines, a triplet of quartets. A simulation of the observed EPR spectrum is shown at the right and agrees with the 12-line prediction and the expected line intensities. Note that the smaller coupling constant (smaller line spacing) is due to the three methoxy hydrogens, while the larger coupling constant (line spacing) is from the two hydrogens bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the unpaired electron. It is often the case that coupling constants decrease in size with distance from a radical's unpaired electron, but there are some notable exceptions, such as the ethyl radical (CHCH).\n\nResonance linewidths are defined in terms of the magnetic induction \"B\" and its corresponding units, and are measured along the \"x\" axis of an EPR spectrum, from a line's center to a chosen reference point of the line. These defined widths are called halfwidths and possess some advantages: for asymmetric lines, values of left and right halfwidth can be given. The halfwidth formula_61 is the distance measured from the line's center to the point in which absorption value has half of maximal absorption value in the center of resonance line. First inclination width formula_62 is a distance from center of the line to the point of maximal absorption curve inclination. In practice, a full definition of linewidth is used. For symmetric lines, halfwidth formula_63, and full inclination width formula_64.\n\nEPR/ESR spectroscopy is used in various branches of science, such as biology, chemistry and physics, for the detection and identification of free radicals in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, and in paramagnetic centers such as F-centers. EPR is a sensitive, specific method for studying both radicals formed in chemical reactions and the reactions themselves. For example, when ice (solid HO) is decomposed by exposure to high-energy radiation, radicals such as H, OH, and HO are produced. Such radicals can be identified and studied by EPR. Organic and inorganic radicals can be detected in electrochemical systems and in materials exposed to UV light. In many cases, the reactions to make the radicals and the subsequent reactions of the radicals are of interest, while in other cases EPR is used to provide information on a radical's geometry and the orbital of the unpaired electron. EPR/ESR spectroscopy is also used in geology and archaeology as a dating tool. It can be applied to a wide range of materials such as carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, silica or other silicates.\n\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) has proven itself as a useful tool in homogeneous catalysis research for characterization of paramagnetic complexes and reactive intermediates. EPR spectroscopy is a particularly useful tool to investigate their electronic structures, which is fundamental to understand their reactivity.\n\nMedical and biological applications of EPR also exist. Although radicals are very reactive, and so do not normally occur in high concentrations in biology, special reagents have been developed to spin-label molecules of interest. These reagents are particularly useful in biological systems. Specially-designed nonreactive radical molecules can attach to specific sites in a biological cell, and EPR spectra can then give information on the environment of these so-called spin labels or spin probes. Spin-labeled fatty acids have been extensively used to study dynamic organisation of lipids in biological membranes, lipid-protein interactions and temperature of transition of gel to liquid crystalline phases.\n\nA type of dosimetry system has been designed for reference standards and routine use in medicine, based on EPR signals of radicals from irradiated polycrystalline α-alanine (the alanine deamination radical, the hydrogen abstraction radical, and the (CO(OH))=C(CH)NH radical) . This method is suitable for measuring gamma and x-rays, electrons, protons, and high-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation of doses in the 1 Gy to 100 kGy range.\n\nEPR/ESR spectroscopy can be applied only to systems in which the balance between radical decay and radical formation keeps the free radicals concentration above the detection limit of the spectrometer used. This can be a particularly severe problem in studying reactions in liquids. An alternative approach is to slow down reactions by studying samples held at cryogenic temperatures, such as 77 K (liquid nitrogen) or 4.2 K (liquid helium). An example of this work is the study of radical reactions in single crystals of amino acids exposed to x-rays, work that sometimes leads to activation energies and rate constants for radical reactions.\n\nThe study of radiation-induced free radicals in biological substances (for cancer research) poses the additional problem that tissue contains water, and water (due to its electric dipole moment) has a strong absorption band in the microwave region used in EPR spectrometers.\n\nEPR/ESR also has been used by archaeologists for the dating of teeth. Radiation damage over long periods of time creates free radicals in tooth enamel, which can then be examined by EPR and, after proper calibration, dated. Alternatively, material extracted from the teeth of people during dental procedures can be used to quantify their cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation. People exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl disaster have been examined by this method.\n\nRadiation-sterilized foods have been examined with EPR spectroscopy, the aim being to develop methods to determine whether a particular food sample has been irradiated and to what dose. \n\nEPR can be used to measure microviscosity and micropolarity within drug delivery systems as well as the characterization of colloidal drug carriers.\n\nEPR/ESR spectroscopy has been used to measure properties of crude oil, in particular asphaltene and vanadium content. EPR measurement of asphaltene content is a function of spin density and solvent polarity. Prior work dating to the 1960s has demonstrated the ability to measure vanadium content to sub-ppm levels.\n\nIn the field of quantum computing, pulsed EPR is used to control the state of electron spin qubits in materials such as diamond, silicon and gallium arsenide.\n\nHigh-field high-frequency EPR measurements are sometimes needed to detect subtle spectroscopic details. However, for many years the use of electromagnets to produce the needed fields above 1.5 T was impossible, due principally to limitations of traditional magnet materials. The first multifunctional millimeter EPR spectrometer with a superconducting solenoid was described in the early 1970s by Prof. Y. S. Lebedev's group (Russian Institute of Chemical Physics, Moscow) in collaboration with L. G. Oranski's group (Ukrainian Physics and Technics Institute, Donetsk), which began working in the Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics, Chernogolovka around 1975. Two decades later, a W-band EPR spectrometer was produced as a small commercial line by the German Bruker Company, initiating the expansion of W-band EPR techniques into medium-sized academic laboratories.\n\nThe EPR waveband is stipulated by the frequency or wavelength of a spectrometer's microwave source (see Table).\n\nEPR experiments often are conducted at X and, less commonly, Q bands, mainly due to the ready availability of the necessary microwave components (which originally were developed for radar applications). A second reason for widespread X and Q band measurements is that electromagnets can reliably generate fields up to about 1 tesla. However, the low spectral resolution over \"g\"-factor at these wavebands limits the study of paramagnetic centers with comparatively low anisotropic magnetic parameters. Measurements at formula_27 > 40 GHz, in the millimeter wavelength region, offer the following advantages:\n\nThis was demonstrated experimentally in the study of various biological, polymeric and model systems at D-band EPR.\n\nThe microwave bridge contains both the microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves, but modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source there is an isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control of the flow of microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.\n\nMost EPR spectrometers are reflection spectrometers, meaning that the detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation coming back from the cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.\n\nAt low energies (less than 1 μW) the diode current is proportional to the microwave power and the detector is referred to as a square-law detector. At higher power levels (greater than 1 mW) the diode current is proportional to the square root of the microwave power and the detector is called a linear detector. In order to obtain optimal sensitivity as well as quantitative information the diode should be operating within the linear region. To ensure the detector is operating at that level the reference arm serves to provide a \"bias\".\n\nIn an EPR spectrometer the magnetic assembly includes the magnet with a dedicated power supply as well as a field sensor or regulator such as a Hall probe. EPR spectrometers use one of two types of magnet which is determined by the operating microwave frequency (which determine the range of magnetic field strengths required). The first is an electromagnet which are generally capable of generating field strengths of up to 1.5 T making them suitable for measurements using the Q-band frequency. In order to generate field strengths appropriate for W-band and higher frequency operation superconducting magnets are employed. The magnetic field is homogeneous across the sample volume and has a high stability at static field.\n\nThe microwave resonator is designed to enhance the microwave magnetic field at the sample in order to induce EPR transitions. It is a metal box with a rectangular or cylindrical shape that resonates with microwaves (like an organ pipe with sound waves). At the resonance frequency of the cavity microwaves remain inside the cavity and are not reflected back. Resonance means the cavity stores microwave energy and its ability to do this is given by the quality factor , defined by the following equation:\n\nformula_69\n\nThe higher the value of the higher the sensitivity of the spectrometer. The energy dissipated is the energy lost in one microwave period. Energy may be lost to the side walls of the cavity as microwaves may generate currents which in turn generate heat. A consequence of resonance is the creation of a standing wave inside the cavity. Electromagnetic standing waves have their electric and magnetic field components exactly out of phase. This provides an advantage as the electric field provides non-resonant absorption of the microwaves, which in turn increases the dissipated energy and reduces . To achieve the largest signals and hence sensitivity the sample is positioned such that it lies within the magnetic field maximum and the electric field minimum. When the magnetic field strength is such that an absorption event occurs, the value of will be reduced due to the extra energy loss. This results in a change of impedance which serves to stop the cavity from being critically coupled. This means microwaves will now be reflected back to the detector (in the microwave bridge) where an EPR signal is detected.\n\nThe dynamics of electron spins are best studied with pulsed measurements. Microwave pulses typically 10–100 ns long are used to control the spins in the Bloch sphere. The spin–lattice relaxation time can be measured with an inversion recovery experiment.\n\nAs with pulsed NMR, the Hahn echo is central to many pulsed EPR experiments. A Hahn echo decay experiment can be used to measure the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different spacings of the two pulses. This reveals the decoherence, which is not refocused by the formula_60 pulse. In simple cases, an exponential decay is measured, which is described by the formula_71 time.\n\nPulsed electron paramagnetic resonance could be advanced into electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy (ENDOR), which utilizes waves in the radio frequencies. Since different nuclei with unpaired electrons respond to different wavelengths, radio frequencies are required at times. Since the results of the ENDOR gives the coupling resonance between the nuclei and the unpaired electron, the relationship between them can be determined.\n\n"}

The population was 2,753 as of the 2016 census. The town is one of the main entry points into Quetico Provincial Park and promotes itself as the \"Canoeing Capital of Canada\". Atikokan was originally established as a rail stop for the Canadian Northern Railway.\n\nThe town of Atikokan is an enclave within the Unorganized Rainy River District. It is officially located within the Central Time Zone, but uses year round, therefore in practice it is located in Eastern Standard Time Zone and does not observe daylight saving time. \n\nThe original settlers to the Atikokan area were the \"Oschekamega Wenenewak\" (The people of the cross ridges) Ojibwa / Chippewa. They lived by themselves until the arrival of Jacques de Noyon in 1688. His journey was critical for the expansion and exploration of the Atikokan area.\n\nPalliser Gladman-Hind suggested the first real road in the area, he intended for it to go as far as possible starting from Arrow Lake, and after the road's end travellers would take a waterway to Fort Frances. Simon Dawson, on the other hand, thought the road could go from Dog Lake, to Thunder Bay, then using a series of dams, would allow even the larger boats to travel along the route of Dog River, Savanne River, Lac des Mille Lacs, via Pickerel Lake and Sturgeon Lake.\n\nThe government, ignoring both plans, decided to build a road west of Lac des Mille Lacs, down the Seine River and finally into Rainy Lake. In 1859, Simon James Dawson was hired to begin the route, but the plan was held up due to poor economic conditions in the east. In 1867, after Confederation, there became an increased need for communication to the west. Construction of the Dawson Trail began in Prince Arthur's Landing in 1868. Construction was sped up in 1869 as the Riel Rebellion resulted in the need to transport troops.\n\nTom Rawn and his wife, Mary, were the first residents of Atikokan, arriving by canoe in 1899. Rawn was lured to Atikokan by both the allure of gold in the area and because of plans by the Canadian Northern Railway to build a divisional point. Tom moved here because he had heard that there was need of shelter for the workers on the railway. Within a year of moving to Atikokan, Tom Rawn built the Pioneer Hotel, which had 18 rooms on its second story. In 1900, he was the first to strike a claim for iron ore in the Steep Rock area.\nIn 1937, when Julian Cross discovered ore, it seemed like Atikokan had some potential for becoming a real town. The first real showing was the construction of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Clark Street. Pitt Construction arrived later to construct roads. Their new way of making roads with machines amazed old-timers, who were used to making them using a pick, shovel and wheelbarrow. In 1950, the population had grown to 3,000 people.\n\nThe first businesses in Atikokan could buy lots on Main Street for only $10 an acre, but the prices soon skyrocketed to $100 per square foot. Even with the high costs, stores, restaurants, banks and other establishments sprang up very quickly. The second bank to open was the Toronto-Dominion, the third, the Royal Bank of Canada is the only remaining bank.\n\nDuring the fur trade era, major fur transportation and trading routes used by the voyageurs passed through the waters and portages south of what would later be Atikokan.\n\nThe potential for the Steep Rock iron mine was revealed in 1897 by a non-resident geologist named William McInnis. Nothing was done until the winter of 1929–1930, when Julian Cross started interviewing iron and steel companies to try to unlock Steep Rock's potential. He finally convinced a company from Duluth, Minnesota, led by Robert Whiteside to take the job.\n\nIn 1932, Dr. McKenzie and Tom Rawn staked out the entire South East bay of Steep Rock. They then found a spot, sunk a shaft and found it was rich with high grade hematite. The mine was quickly abandoned as they had trouble keeping water out of it. In 1940, Rawn sold 109 claims located west of Steep Rock to Midwest Iron Mining Corporation, and in March of that year, with 60 claims in his name, created Rawn Iron Mines Ltd. Four months later, on July 23, Rawn went out prospecting near Sapawe, and never returned. Parties searched for weeks, but his remains were never found.\nAn aboriginal person discovered The Hammond Reef Mine in 1894 on the shore of Sawbill Lake, about 30 miles from Atikokan and showed it to John Hammond. A 10 stamp mill was built there in 1897 and 30 more stamps were added along with a hydro electric power house. It later closed down in 1899 because the results were disappointing. It then reopened in 1938.\n\nTimber was first noticed in the area as early as the 1870s. There were 31 surveys, with 21 being in Quetico Provincial Park and 10 being in the Clearwater and White Otter Castle area. The first attempt at harvesting timber in the area was in 1886. A sawmill was located on the height of land east of the French Portage.\n\nThe strip between Lac La Croix and French Lake held great potential for logging of red and white pine, however, the barren shores around Saganaga show that there were many fires there, with approximately one sixth of the total area having been destroyed by fires. These forest fires were usually caused by the carelessness of troops that passed through the area years before on the Dawson Trail. H.C. Smith described the aftermath as \"gigantic, half burned dead pines, which, towering in the air, add so much to the wildness and desolation of the scene\" and \"too often caused by the carelessness of explorers, prospectors, and hunters; The Indians are very careful to extinguish their fires during the dry season ... it is regretted that the fatal carelessness of the others cannot be checked.\" He noted that the pine in the unburnt area was excellent. The best trees were said to be found on Trout, Darkey, and Brent Lakes, and the farthest Southeast end of Sturgeon Lake.\nBefore the 2nd World War, mineral exploration in the area determined the presence of a large, high grade, iron ore deposit at the bottom of Steep Rock Lake. After the war a large water diversion project on the Seine River system was undertaken to enable the draining and dredging of Steep Rock lake in order to develop open-pit mining operations.\n\nTwo large mines (Steep Rock Iron Mines and Caland Ore Co.) commenced operations in the late 1950s and continued for more than 30 years. When the mines closed in the early 1980s the town of Atikokan suffered economically but continued to survive on natural resource-based industries and tourism.\n\nIn 1994, a 10 megawatt hydroelectric generating station (Valerie Falls Power) was developed on the Seine River diversion that had facilitated the opening of the mines 40 years earlier. From 2012 until 2014, the Atikokan Generating Station was converted from a coal-fueled to a hundred percent biomass-fueled plant.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Resolute Forest Products announced its plans to develop a new single-line random-length sawmill located in the Atikokan area, to be operational in 2014. The plan would create 90 direct jobs in Atikokan, with the additional benefit of supplying residual forest products to nearby pulp and paper mills.\n\nAtikokan has a humid continental climate (Köppen \"Dfb\") with four distinct seasons. Winters are long, cold and snowy while summers are warm. Precipitation is higher during the summer months and lower during the winter months.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Atikokan was on July 11 & 12, 1936. This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the province of Ontario. Atikokan shares this record with Fort Frances. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 19 January 1943 and 15 February 1939.\n\nAtikokan's main employers are the Atikokan Generating Station located 20 kilometres north of the community, the general hospital, Quetico Provincial Park and (collectively) its canoeing outfitters. \nOntario Power Generation (OPG) has been one of Atikokan's main employers since the early 1980s. Constructed as a fossil-fuel burning facility, the Atikokan Generating Station burned coal shipped from Saskatchewan until 2012. It was then converted to a biomass plant, re-opening in 2014. Formerly, Fibretech, a fibre board processing plant in Atikokan closed, but was converted by Rentech Inc. to produce wood pellets to supply the newly converted biomass generating station.\n\nThe Sapawe lumber mill located approximately 30 km from Atikokan reopened under management of Resolute Forest Products. The mill employs 108 workers.\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines Limited is planning a new gold mine and ore processing facility at its Hammond Reef site approximately 30 kilometers north of Atikokan. A revised environmental assessment was approved in 2018, building on work by previous owner Osisko Mining Corporation. Two main open pits are planned, and the adjoining plant will process 60,000 tonnes of ore per day. Agnico Eagle planned to assess the economic viability of the mine in 2019.\n\nThe town is located off Highway 11, between Thunder Bay and Fort Frances. A CN Rail branch line runs along the south side of town. When Atikokan opened its first rail line, fares were $15. Atikokan Municipal Airport is located to the northwest of the town.\n\nAtikokan was selected as the host site for the 2003 edition of 'Raid the North Extreme', a televised 6 day multi-sport expedition race that visits wilderness locations across Canada. A key factor in the selection was the proximity to Quetico Provincial Park. Quetico Park, located about 20 minutes south from the town of Atikokan, is a protected park with a route of lakes that was once traveled by the voyageurs.\n\nIn 2018 the Town of Atikokan completed a project to connect and renovate the existing Atikokan Municipal Swimming Pool and Community Arena. The resulting modern facility was named the Atikokan Recreation & Wellness Centre which features a 14,580 square foot ice surface, 25 meter long pool, and multi-purpose room with adjoining kitchen available for private rentals.\n\nA large portion of recreation in Atikokan is at the town's Charleson Recreation Area. The area is named for the Canadian Charleson Iron Mine (a subsidiary of Charleson Iron Mining Co. of Minnesota), which was an iron ore mine operating there between 1958 and 1964. In 2005 the Charleson Recreation Area Committee formed to consolidate the various groups that use the area into a working committee that would develop the area for further recreation use by town residents and to enhance tourism potential. The committee continues to meet monthly to discuss and implement maintenance and improvements.\n\nMajor Annual events in Atikokan include the Atikokan Bass Classic, a smallmouth bass tournament for teams of all kinds, the Poker Run and Annual Sno-Ho Rally held by the Atikokan Sno-Ho Snowmobiling Club and the Atikokan Mud Slingers 4x4 Races, where drivers can show off their trucks and skills to try and make it through a 300-foot mud track at Charleson Recreation Centre.\n\nLittle Falls Recreation Centre is the home of Little Falls Golf Club and Little Falls Curling Club. Little Falls Golf Club is a 9-hole course that is double tee'd so players have the option of a 9 or 18 hole game. Little Falls Curling Club has a four sheet rink and hosts various bonspiels throughout the season.\n\nJust 9 km North of town, off of Highway 622, is Atikokan's Mount Fairweather Ski Hill. Mount Fairweather opened in 1967 for downhill skiing and snowboarding and continues to operate weekends and holidays from December to March (weather permitting). Mount Fairweather is a 106-meter drop with 12 name runs and operates both a rope tow lift and a T-bar lift. The chalet has helmets, boots, and skis available for use for free on a first come first served basis and also offers a canteen, washrooms, comfortable seating, and an outdoor sun deck.\n\nThe Town of Atikokan also operates parks, playgrounds, three skating rinks, Bunnell Park Campground, the Pioneer Club (a drop in centre for seniors ), toboggan hill (the previous location of the Mount Fairweather Ski Hill), and two baseball diamonds.\n\nOther clubs and activities in Atikokan include: Atikokan Minor Hockey Association, Atikokan Figure Skating Club, Beaten Path Nordic Trails, Mount Fairweather Alpine Skiing, Atikokan Sno-Ho Snowmobiling Club, Atikokan Bowling Association, Atikokan Public Library programs, Atikokan Native Friendship Centre (ANFC) and Quetico Provincial Park's Natural Heritage Education outreach programs.\n\nFitness facilities exist at the Atikokan Native Friendship Centre (ANFC) and Ironworks Gym.\n\nAtikokan is served by one elementary school, one separate school and one high school. Public Schools are administered by the Rainy River District School Board, St. Patrick's School is administered by the Northwest Catholic District School Board.\n\nPublic Schools:\n\nSeparate School:\n\nNewspapers:\n\nRadio:\n\nTelevision:\n\nThe Atikokan Public Library started on December 16, 1952 with only 700 books. Currently it has a varied collection of 30,000 items such as books, CDs, DVDs, and e-books, and offers public computers and computer instruction.\n\nThe Atikokan Centennial Museum has a collection of heavy equipment from early logging, mining and railroad days.\n\nThe Atikokan Entertainment Series offers six or more high quality performances per season.\n\nQuetico Provincial Park's Artist in Residence Program offers workshops, demonstrations and opportunities to artists from around the world to immerse themselves in the beauty of the area.\n\nThe Pictograph Gallery is a volunteer-run gallery that features arts and crafts of local and regional artists.\n\nThe 39th Council for the Corporation of the Town of Atikokan was elected in October 2018 and were sworn in on December 3, 2018 for a term ending in 2022. In this election Mayor Dennis Brown was reelected to lead the municipal government in Atikokan. In addition to Mayor Brown a total of six Councillors represent Atikokan, three of which were also reelected; Liz Shine, Rob Ferguson, and Mary Makarenko and three Councillors; Sally Burns, Jim Johnson, and Brian Stimson are new to council.\n\nThe Atikokan General Hospital is a 41-bed hospital. Serving about 6,000 patients a year, this hospital offers emergency care, long term care, and rehabilitation services.\n\n\n"}

The village straddles the London to Bath (A4) road between the towns of Reading (8 miles) and Newbury (6 miles). The village homes are clustered and are on the northern side of the plain of the River Kennet, with the Berkshire Downs rising through the fields and woods of the village northwards.\n\nBesides the A4, the London to Exeter (via Taunton) railway line and the Kennet and Avon Canal also pass through the village. Woolhampton is served by Midgham railway station in the village. The railway station was originally known as Woolhampton railway station but, according to local legend, was renamed Midgham railway station (after the village of Midgham, one mile west-northwest) in order to avoid possible confusion with the similarly named Wolverhampton railway station.\n\nThe A4 road forms the main street of the village. An unclassified road runs to the south, towards the village of Brimpton. This crosses the railway line by the station on a level crossing, followed shortly afterwards by a swing bridge across the river and canal (which share a common channel at this point). Woolhampton Lock lies just to the west. Two other unclassified roads leave the village to the north, climbing into the Berkshire Downs.\n\nBecause of its location on the Bath road, Woolhampton was well known for its coaching inns. Only one of these survive on the main road, the \"Angel\" after the \"Falmouth Arms\" closed in 2014 and converted to residential property. A second public house, the \"Rowbarge\", is, as its name suggests, situated alongside the Kennet and Avon Canal next to the swing bridge.\nOn the higher land some half mile to the north of the village is the adjacent settlement of Upper Woolhampton, which contains both Woolhampton (\"St Peter's\") Church and the village school. A further half mile to the north, but still within the civil parish, is the Benedictine Douai Abbey community, and its now-closed Douai School. Between Douai Abbey and the village is the historic Woolhampton House, which now houses Elstree School, a preparatory school that moved to Woolhampton from the London suburb of Elstree during the Second World War.\n\nThe civil parish of Woolhampton includes the village of Woolhampton, the adjacent settlement of Upper Woolhampton, and the rural area to the north, east and south of the village. It has a parish council, and also lies in the West Berkshire local government district and the Newbury parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe Woolhampton Reed Bed, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies alongside the River Kennet within the parish and to the south east of the village. The dense reed bed, with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland, is notable for its nesting passerine bird populations and for the diversity of insects it supports.\n\nUpper Woolhampton in Bucklebury has long been in that larger parish ecclesiastically and secularly. it is on the same wide escarpment and has approximately the same amount of housing and population as Woolhampton itself.\n\nThe war memorial in Woolhampton was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1920.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1926038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926038", "title": "2001 Polish parliamentary election", "text": "2001 Polish parliamentary election\n\nThe 2001 Polish parliamentary election was held on 23 September 2001 to elect deputies to both houses of the National Assembly. The election concluded with an overwhelming victory for the centre-left Democratic Left Alliance – Labor Union, the electoral coalition between the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Labour Union (UP), which captured 41% of the vote in the crucial lower house Sejm. The 2001 election is recognized as marking the emergence of both Civic Platform (PO) and Law and Justice (PiS) as players in Polish politics, while also witnessing the outright collapse of the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and its former coalition partner, the Freedom Union (UW).\n\nVoter turnout for the 2001 election was 46.29% For this election only, list seats were allocated using the Sainte-Laguë method instead of the D'Hondt method.\n\nAt the end of its four-year term, the ruling AWS government of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek faced bleak prospects for the September parliamentary election. In the previous presidential election in 2000, the SLD's Aleksander Kwaśniewski achieved a landslide reelection over AWS candidate Marian Krzaklewski. Economically, Polish consumer confidence dropped to its lowest since the mid-1990s, with unemployment rising above 16%. Politically, the Buzek government faced a series of crises undermining its credibility. In May 2000, the AWS' junior coalition partner, the Freedom Union, walked out of the government regarding the party's objections to the slow pace of reform, forcing Buzek to set up a relatively weak minority government in its place. Later in July 2001, Buzek's government was again hit by three further ministerial resignations over corruption charges, while the government's reform program for pensions and health care grounded to a halt in the Sejm.\n\nIn light of Buzek's besieged administration, opposition parties took advantage of AWS' organisational and economic weaknesses. From the centre left, a political coalition between the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Labour Union (UP), headed by Leszek Miller, appeared as the ruling government's most formidable, united and vocal opposition. On the centre right, Solidarity's traditional spectrum of support increasingly became divided by the emergence of new political groups. Civic Platform (PO), composed of former AWS and UW members, repeated calls for a low flat-rate income tax and a culling of bureaucracy to attract investment. Further down the right, the Law and Justice party (PiS), composed of AWS' more conservative and anti-communist adherents, campaigned on promises of tough anti-corruption and organised crime legislation.\n\nThe campaign leading up to the September election was marred by voter apathy due to the summer holidays, and was also marginalized by the September 11 attacks in the United States.\n\nThe SLD triumphed in the final tally, receiving 41% percent of the vote, though shy of an outright parliamentary majority in the Sejm. The party increased its representation by 52 seats, earning it 216 representatives, and returned to the Chancellery after a four-year period of sitting in opposition. Partly due to the fractious nature of its opponents, the SLD secured pluralities in all of Poland's voivodeships as well as in an overwhelming majority of the nation's powiats. On the centre right, Civic Platform entered parliament for the first time, coming in second place with nearly 13% of the vote. The party stood relatively strong in Pomeranian Voivodeship.\n\nSurprisingly, ultra-nationalist parties performed well in the election's final results. The left-wing nationalist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (SRP) increased its vote 100-fold from the 1997 election, securing 53 seats and 10% of the vote, coming in third place. Headed by populist Andrzej Lepper, the party campaigned against Warsaw excess and Poland's ongoing negotiations to enter the European Union. On the far right, the League of Polish Families, which campaigned on a staunchly Catholic and anti-EU platform, also entered the Sejm for the first time, gaining 38 seats and 8% of the vote.\n\nLaw and Justice (PiS), headed by Lech Kaczyński, a former Minister of Justice in the Buzek government, scored 44 seats and 9.5% of the vote, also securing his party's entrance into the Sejm for the first time. The Polish People's Party (PSL) won 42 seats, slightly reversing the party's devastating losses from 1997. The PSL would later enter into coalition with the SLD to achieve a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe election proved catastrophic for Solidarity Electoral Action and its former Freedom Union coalition partner. Both parties failed to secure the 8% for coalitions and 5% for standalone parties threshold to enter the Sejm, with AWS and UW falling to 5.6% and 3.1%, respectively. In the election's aftermath, Prime Minister Buzek tendered his resignation. Both the AWS and UW faced political extinction following the election's aftermath. The AWS dissolved itself by the end of 2001; the UW lingered until its own dissolution in 2005.\n\n"}

Ripken Stadium was one of the first short-season Single-A ballparks to have a fully enclosed club level and skyboxes.\n\nIn 2009, The Maryland Redbirds, of the Cal Ripken Sr. Collegiate Baseball League, (the CRSCBL), played all weekday games and one weekend doubleheader at the stadium. The CRSCBL previously used the stadium for the annual all-star game in 2005 and 2007. The stadium also hosted the inaugural Ripken Cup collegiate baseball invitational between University of Maryland and Towson University on April 15, 2014 and May 7, 2014. The 2016 Big East Conference Baseball Tournament was held in Aberdeen May 26–29.\n\n"}

Like the WeatherStar, it is installed at the cable provider's headend.\n\nThe IntelliStar has many enhanced features over its predecessor, the Weather Star XL. Like all other WeatherStar systems, the IntelliStar receives its data over a satellite connection and over the Internet. However, unlike the rest of the systems, it has the capability to receive more complex information in a more efficient manner. It also has a DualFeed feature, which allows a selection of two different video feeds. In the event of inclement weather, the DualFeed option would switch from the first (network) feed, to a second (localized) feed, providing weather information to a specific STAR or network of STARs. By doing this, the specified network of STARs could be addressed with weather updates, versus the entire national network of STARs (where such information would be irrelevant).\n\nIt also has an improved graphics display and dynamic radar capabilities. HiRAD (High Resolution Aggregated Data) technology – which was added to the IntelliStar in 2006 – allows The Weather Channel to choose any city, town or landmark as an observation or forecast site and provide data. Occasionally, the HiRAD function will fail, in which case the National Weather Service sites are used (only the current conditions – and previously, the eight-city product and regional/metro products – are affected significantly).\n\nIn May 2015, it was announced that all IntelliStar units would be replaced with either the IntelliStar 2 or the IntelliStar 2 Jr. by October 1, 2015. The IntelliStar was discontinued on November 16, 2015.\n\nThe IntelliStar differs in design from previous WeatherStar units, as the system is basically a customized rack-mount Intel CPU-based personal computer (PC). It runs on the FreeBSD operating system, running specialized software written by The Weather Channel to make it function as an IntelliStar, but otherwise using commodity hardware of the PC platform. This was done to minimize maintenance costs, and to ease upgrading of the IntelliStar units. The previous WeatherStar units used a proprietary hardware design that hampered any hardware upgrades (the Weather Star XL, for comparison, uses proprietary SGI hardware, and runs IRIX). TWC has contributed code to the FreeBSD development community, and funded the initial development of Radeon 8500/R200 generation 3D graphics drivers used under both Linux and FreeBSD.\n\n"}
{"id": "1926054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926054", "title": "Catmore", "text": "Catmore\n\nCatmore is a civil parish and small village in West Berkshire about southeast of Wantage. Catmore is in the Berkshire Downs and the centre of the village is about above sea level. The 2001 Census recorded a population of only 28, making Catmore the least populous parish in Berkshire.\n\nIn the 2011 Census the Office for National Statistics did not publish Catmore's population separately, but combined it with the neighbouring civil parish of Farnborough. But Catmore remains a separate civil parish, governed by its own parish meeting.\n\nThe toponym \"Catmore\" is derived from the Old English for \"wild-cat lake\". The earliest known records of it are from AD 916 and 931 in the \"Cartularium Saxonicum\", where it appears as \"Catmere\", \"Catmeringa\" and \"Catmæringa\". In the same body of charters it is recorded again in AD 951 as \"Catmeres gemære\" and \"Catbeorh\". The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as \"Catmere\". It evolved via \"Catmor\" in the 12th century, \"Cattermere\" in the 14th century, \"Catmard\" in the 15th century and \"Cattmere\" in the 17th century before reaching its present form.\n\nIn the time of Edward the Confessor (reigned 1042–66) a Saxon called Ezui held the manor. The manor was devastated in the Norman Conquest of England.\n\nThe Domesday Book of 1086 records that what was left of the manor was held by the Norman baron Henry de Ferrers. Under the de Ferrers, Catmore became part of the Honour of Tutbury. Two centuries later Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby took part in a rebellion against Edward III. He was defeated at Chesterfield in 1266, imprisoned, and all his properties were confiscated by the Crown.\n\nIn 1267 Edward III created Edmund Crouchback 1st Earl of Lancaster and granted him many of the de Ferrers estates, including those of the Honour of Tutbury. In 1399 Henry Bolingbroke, 2nd Duke of Lancaster became Henry IV and the House of Lancaster's estates were merged with those of the Crown.\n\nCatmore Farm House was the manor house. It was built in the 14th century, extended in the 15th century and again in the 16th century. It is built partly of brick and partly with a timber frame. It is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of Saint Margaret is a Norman building from the latter half of the 12th century. Surviving original Norman work includes the north and south doorways and the font. The north doorway is now blocked and the font has been halved in height.\n\nThe Knights Hospitaller held the advowson of St Margaret's by the time of Richard I (reigned 1189–99). They retained it until Henry VIII had the Order in England suppressed as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nThe nave was re-roofed in 1607. It has collar beams and wind braces and the date is carved on some of its timbers.\n\nBy 1850 the building had been heavily restored and numerous Norman Revival features more ornate than the original work had been added. These include the east window of two round-headed lancets. There is no known record of the date of the work or the name of the architect.\n\nSt Margaret's has one bell, cast by Henry Bagley. The Bagley family ran a bell foundry at Chacombe in Northamptonshire from 1605 until 1785, and for shorter periods also cast bells at Ecton in Northamptonshire and Witney in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe church is a Grade I listed building. The Diocese of Oxford declared it redundant on 1 December 1973 and it vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 13 April 1999. It is open daily to visitors.\n\n"}
{"id": "1926056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926056", "title": "Clark County School District", "text": "Clark County School District\n\nThe Clark County School District is a school district that serves all of Clark County, Nevada, including the cities of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Boulder City, and Pahrump; as well as the census-designated places of Laughlin, Blue Diamond, Logandale, Bunkerville, Goodsprings, Indian Springs, Mount Charleston, Moapa, Searchlight, and Sandy Valley. The district is divided into seven regions and, in addition to the general schools, it also operates 25 alternative schools and programs. The district has limited involvement with charter schools, and with the exception of providing some bus service, does not have any involvement with the private schools in the county. , the district is the sixth largest in the United States.\n\nThe Clark County School District began in 1956 when the Nevada Legislature mandated consolidation of all state school districts into 17 county school districts. This change meant that 14 separate school districts in Clark County would become part of the new Clark County School District.\n\nR. Guild Gray, superintendent at the time of the former Clark County School District No. 2, stated before a Board of School Trustees meeting on February 1, 1956 that the district would be larger than political subdivision in the state of Nevada. Gray believed the district would be larger than the state highway department with 1,300 employees and an annual budget of $7,250,000.\n\nPrior to 1956, each of the individual school districts in the county ran independent of each other, serving their respective cities and/or CDPs.\n\nWhen the district began in 1956, enrollment was just over 20,000 and Clark County had about 103,000 residents. The district would continue to face challenges in the coming years. Funding was its biggest challenge and had been for many years as it contended with explosive population growth.\n\nDue to the large number of families moving into the Las Vegas area, the school district saw tremendous growth in student enrollment from the 1990s through 2007. Several bond issues were approved by the voters to help the district deal with this growth. This has resulted in many new schools being constructed. In some years, as many as 16 schools have opened. 320,400 students were enrolled during the 2015-2016 school year.\n\nThis resulted in a very high demand for teachers to staff the classrooms. As a result, the district had to be creative in finding teachers to hire including recruiting of teachers from other states and other countries.\n\nIn 2008, the statewide recession impacted the district. In 2012, voters failed to pass a school construction bond. By 2014, the district was overwhelmed with new students as the economy recovered. Elementary schools were operating at 117.6% of planned capacity, with some schools at almost 200%. If a 2016 bond passes, officials hope new schools might be built by 2020.\n\nBeginning in the 2011–2012 school year, CCSD schools were reorganized into Performance Zones. As of the 2012–2013 school year, there were 13 geographic Performance Zones and one additional \"Turnaround Schools\" Performance Zone. Then in the 2014–2015 school year, there were 16 performance zones and assistant chiefs.\n\nThe school district is governed by a seven-member board of trustees elected from sections of the county. The superintendent of schools is Dr. Jesús F. Jara who was appointed by the board in May 2018. School board members serve staggered four year terms.\n\nCurrent members of the Board of School Trustees are:\n\n\nSince the district operates in a valley that has had air quality concerns, it currently operates most of its bus fleet with a fuel mixture containing 20% biodiesel. Due to its location in the Mojave desert, there is not much native material that can be used to create biodiesel fuel, so the district partnered with Biodiesel Industries to use the grease from area restaurants as an additive. Due to tourism, the area generates twice the national average of 3 gallons of grease per resident per year, making this a reliable feed source for biodiesel fuel.\n\nA student must register for school transportation when they register for school. A routing and scheduling program determines student transportation eligibility, assigns bus stops to eligible students, and notifies parents of the arrangements. It is not uncommon to expect older students, middle school and high school, to walk to and from school with distances up to three miles one way. For these students, air quality is a concern, as is heat. Temperatures at the beginning of the school year have been known to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It is suggested that students susceptible to health conditions related to heat and/or air-quality receive transportation to school.\n\nTo reduce construction costs, most schools are being built to standard designs. These designs are adapted to the various sites to deal with different topographies and site sizes. While most elementary schools are single story buildings, the district has built some demonstration schools using two story plans so that smaller sites could be used allowing schools to be located in built up areas that do not have space for a traditional single story design. New school buildings after 2016 are using the two story designs.\n\nMany middle schools built during the 1960s and 1980s were built in circular designs. An example of this design is the one story, 9-month middle school, B. Mahlon Brown Junior High School in Henderson. These schools are usually with one directional hallways with several different \"wings\" with each hosting different subjects (i.e., 100's Language Arts, 200's Mathematics, 300's Science).\n\nDuring the 2010-2011 school, all schools converted to a 9-month school year due to budget shortfalls. Two campuses were converted back to year-round schedules beginning in the 2013-2014 school year. For the 2014-2015, 10 additional elementary school campuses were converted to the year-round schedule. This conversion was due entirely to overcrowding in these school buildings.\n\nThe district also adds \"portable classrooms\", which are modular buildings, at many schools to provide additional space for classes.\n\nThe district had contracted with Edison Schools to operate several schools in an effort to improvement performance at those selected schools. The contract was terminated at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.\n\nIn 2016, mercury was found in a gymnasium at Walter Johnson Junior High, forcing students to be held for 17 hours for decontamination. One family was also evacuated from their home after more mercury was discovered.\n\n"}

The title sponsor is currently Dubai Duty Free.\n\nThe Irish Open was first played in 1927 and was played annually, except for the war years, until 1950. There was a tournament in 1953, but the event was then not played again until revived in 1975. It has been contested annually since then. From 1963 to 1974 Carroll's sponsored a tournament, generally called the Carroll's International and in 1975 they became the sponsor of the Irish Open which became known as the Carroll's Irish Open.\n\nThe Irish Open is one of the European Tour Rolex Series events. The Rolex Series started in 2017, with each tournament in the series having a minimum prize fund of $7 million. The date was moved to early July, two weeks before the Open Championship.\n\nSince 2014 (except in 2016), it has been one of the Open Qualifying Series with the leading three players who have not already qualified and who finish in the top ten, qualifying for the Open Championship.\n\n\nThe first Irish Open in 1927 was played at Portmarnock Golf Club from 16 to 18 August. There were 18 holes played on the first two days with the leading 60 players and ties playing a further 36 holes on the final day. In a stiff breeze local professional Willie Nolan led after the first day with a course record 72. On the second day Nolan faded after an 83 and the lead was taken by Henry Cotton on 146 with Jack Smith a shot behind. The cut was 165 and exactly 60 players qualified, including 6 amateurs. Conditions were very poor on the final day with the refreshment and press tents blown down and rain falling in torrents. Jack Smith had an excellent 77 in the morning and with Henry Cotton taking 86, Smith had an eight-shot lead over Cotton and Archie Compston. Smith, however, went to pieces and had a final round of 91 and was overtaken by Cotton, who took 81. George Duncan, starting the final round 14 shots behind, scored 74 and finished with a total of 312, beating Smith by three and Cotton by one. Duncan's score of 74 was remarkable in that it was only two strokes over the new course record, on a day when his 74 and Smith's 77 in the morning were the only two rounds under 80 on the final day. Duncan took the Championship Gold Medal and the first prize of £150. Nolan was the leading Irishman, finishing fifth.\n\nAfter Duncan's win in 1927, the event was dominated by English golfers, the only other non-English winner before World War II being Bobby Locke in 1938. Ernest Whitcombe won in 1928, the first of four wins by the Whitcombe brothers; Ernest won again in 1935 while Charles won in 1930 and Reg won in 1936. Ernest Whitcombe had rounds of 68 and 69 on the first two days of the 1928 event, to take a seven stroke lead. Rounds of 73 and 78 on the final day were enough to give him a four stroke victory. The 1929 championship was played again at Portmarnock and resulted in a three-way tie on 309, just 3 strokes better than Duncan's score there in 1927. There was a 36-hole playoff the following day. Abe Mitchell and Archie Compston were level after the first round on 75 with Len Holland five behind. Mitchell scored another 75 in the afternoon to win by two strokes from Compston and ten from Holland. Charles Whitcombe dominated the 1930 tournament, winning by 8 strokes from defending champion Abe Mitchell. Whitcombe led by four after the first two rounds and full away further on the final day. the 1931 championship was won by a relative unknown, Bob Kenyon, who won by two after a final round 70. Five players tied for second place, including Ernest Whitcombe who finished with a course-record 66 on the Royal Dublin links.\n\nAlf Padgham won in 1932 with steady rounds of 71-71-71-70, one ahead of Bill Davies. Bob Kenyon won for the second time in 1933. Defending champion Padgham had led after two rounds but had a disappointing third round 76 and finished runner-up, two behind. Syd Easterbrook won at Portmarnock in 1934 with a total of 284, 25 better than the winning score there in 1929, to win by 7 strokes from the Irish amateur, Joe Brown, who.recorded the best finish by an Irish golfer at that time. Two of the Whitcombe brothers, Ernest and Reg, tied in 1935. Bob Kenyon had a good chance to win for the third time but had 5s at the last two holes to finish a shot behind. In the playoff Reg had a bad start, taking 7 at the first hole. He recovered to be level early in the second round but had another 7 and Ernest eventually won by three strokes.\n\nIn 1932 and 1933, the Irish Open was preceded by an international match between teams of English and Irish professionals. England won the first match 16–2 and the second match 13–3 with two halves. The matches followed the same form as the England–Scotland Professional Match that had been played just before the Open Championship.\n\nAfter his playoff loss in 1935, Reg Whitcombe won in 1936, two ahead of Bill Davies who was a runner-up for the third time. Whitcombe had final day rounds of 68 and 69 for a record low total of 281. Jimmy Adams seemed the likely winner at Royal Portrush in 1937 after finishing on 285. However Bert Gadd finished with two 3s (eagle-birdie) to win by a shot. 20-year-old Bobby Locke, who had recently turned professional, broke the run of English winners in 1938. Henry Cotton had seemed the likely winner but finished 4-5-5-5 while Locke finished 2-4-4-4 and finished a stroke behind. Arthur Lees won in 1939 with a total 287 with Reg Whitcombe two behind. 19-year-old Irish amateur Jimmy Bruen led after two rounds but scored 75 and 81 on the final day to drop into 6th place, leading amateur for the third successive year.\n\nWhen the event resumed at Portmarnock in 1946, Fred Daly became the first Irish winner. The tournament turned in a contest between Daly and Bobby Locke, Daly eventually winning by 4 strokes. No one else was within 10 shots of Daly. There was a second Irish winner at Royal Portrush in 1947 when Harry Bradshaw won the title, two ahead of Flory Van Donck. Max Faulkner led after three rounds but a final round 76 dropped him down to third place. Dai Rees won in 1948, his total of 295 being two better than Norman Von Nida. Faulkner again led after three round but a 77 left him tied for third place. Bradshaw won for a second time at Belvoir Park in 1949. Bobby Locke came close to matching him but finished a stroke behind. The 1950 tournament was won by the Australian Ossie Pickworth, two ahead of John Panton and Norman Von Nida.\n\nThe event was not held in 1951 or 1952 but was held again in 1953 at Belvoir Park. Eric Brown won with a score of 272, a stroke ahead of Harry Weetman. 22-year-old Peter Alliss had taken an early clubhouse lead on 274 but was eventually beaten by Weetman and then Brown, finishing in third place. After 1953 the event was not played again until it was revived in 1975. From 1963 to 1974 Carroll's sponsored a tournament, generally called the Carroll's International, which had been a European Tour event since the tour started in 1972. For the 1975 European Tour season the Carroll's International tournament was dropped and Carroll's became the sponsor of the Irish Open, which took its place on the tour.\n\nThe 1975 Irish Open was held at Woodbrook Golf Club, which had hosted the Carroll's International events since 1967. Christy O'Connor Jnr became the third Irish winner, finishing one ahead of Harry Bannerman, and took the first prize of £5,000.\n\nThe Irish Open has been played at a variety of dates from mid-May to the end of August, but since the start of the Rolex series in 2017 it has been held in early July, two weeks before the Open Championship.\n\nThe tournament enjoys one of the largest galleries on the European Tour. In 2010, the Irish Open at Killarney Golf & Fishing Club had an attendance of 85,179 over four days, second only to the BMW PGA Championship. In 2011, Killarney Golf & Fishing Club tallied in excess of 86,500 over four days. This was again the second highest on the European Tour to the BMW PGA Championship. In 2012, Royal Portrush Golf Club had a record attendance of 112,000 over four days; 131,000 over the six days. This was the only time a European Tour event had sold out prior to play on all four days and was the highest attendance ever recorded on the European Tour.\n\nSince 2008, it has been the only European Tour event played in Ireland. The European Open was held at the K Club in Straffan for thirteen years from 1995 to 2007 while the 2007 Seve Trophy and the 2006 Ryder Cup were the last important men's professional team competitions played in Ireland.\n\nFollowing the departure of Nissan as title sponsor in 2006, Adare Golf Club, part of the Adare Manor Hotel and Golf Resort in County Limerick, had planned to host the tournament for three years, from 2007 to 2009. After two years, it was announced in January 2009 that they could no longer sustain the losses incurred by hosting the event for a third year. In early March, the European Tour confirmed the national championship would return to County Louth Golf Club, Baltray, which had last hosted in 2004, with a new sponsor, 3 Mobile.\n\nFáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority of the Republic of Ireland, agreed to sponsor in 2011, but with a reduced purse, cut in half to €1.5 million. In 2015 the event was sponsored by Dubai Duty Free in conjunction with the Rory Foundation. In October 2015, it was announced that Dubai Duty Free had extended their sponsorship to 2018 along with the Rory Foundation. In May 2018, it was announced that Dubai Duty Free would extend their sponsorship to 2022.\n\n\n(a) indicates an amateur golfer.

They also released several cassettes, and their recordings appeared in several compilations. They recorded three singles, the best known being \"All Women Are Bitches, Repeat!\", released on the independent record label K Records. Despite the controversy surrounding the song, it was reviewed by Everett True and named 'Single of the Week' in the UK music magazine \"Melody Maker\". The song was also included on the band's last full-length recording, \"36-C\". The band's last release was the song \"Imbecile\", which appeared on the \"Fields and Streams\" compilation in 2002 on the Kill Rock Stars label.\n\nFifth Column have been nominated for a Polaris Music Prize in the Heritage section for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize and 2017 Polaris Music Prize. as well as 2018 Polaris Music Prize\n\nAzar and Fifth Column raised close to $50,000 for women's shelters and varied abortion clinics throughout North America over a 17-year span. Azar organized two International Women's Day Events in the late 1990s at The McGill Women's Club in Toronto in support of the Native Women's Shelter and 'Andayyan', which featured the work of Aboriginal, Metis and non-native women artists. This curative aspect was created with Artist Rebecca Baird. The coordination of the event with Azar was with filmmaker Cassandra Nicolau.\n\nCaroline has also recorded, playing organ for several other bands including Kickstand from New York City, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Greek Buck, and The Hidden Cameras from Toronto.\n\nAlong with G.B. Jones, Jena von Brucker, Johnny Noxzema, Rex, and others, Azar edited \"Double Bill\", a zine that was sometimes referred to as an \"anti-zine\" and provoked much commentary, including articles in \"The Village Voice\", from its inception in 1991 until 2001, when it ceased publication.

The Kennet and Avon Canal passes through the settlement with Aldermaston Lock near the centre while the Great Western Railway passes at the northern side where Aldermaston railway station is also located. The A340 road from Basingstoke passes through the village crossing the canal over a single file lift bridge and joins the A4 road which runs just north of the village.\n\nThe River Kennet was made navigable between Reading and Newbury and opened as the Kennet Navigation in 1723. The section running through Aldermaston Wharf is a canal navigation (from Frouds Lane Marina to Ufton Bridge) with the original River Kennet continuing approx 1/2 mile south of the canal. A wharf was constructed here (to the immediate east of the current lift bridge) and a trading community developed around it. In addition carpenters were required to service the locks and bridges. On completion of the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810, local trade flourished even more with exports of timber products, malt and flour and imports of coal, groceries and manufactured goods. Canal trade continues at Aldermaston, primarily in leisure and tourism. A visitor and tea room is operated adjacent to a marina and boat hire business.\n\nWhen the Great Western Railway bought the canal in the 1850s a canal spur was constructed to the railway sidings to allow transfer of goods between canal and rail. Some of this has now been infilled. Strange's Brewery was sited just south of the lock. In the late 18th century the brewery was owned by Francis Strange. The brewery was sold in 1952 and demolished.\n\nThe village has grown significantly through new housing developments over the last 25 years. The main developments in chronological order are:\n\n\nNearby are the towns of Newbury, Thatcham and Reading. Neighbouring villages are Aldermaston, Midgham, Beenham, Woolhampton and Padworth. Aldermaston Wharf falls within three parishes—Padworth, Aldermaston and Beenham.\n\nA small private airfield can be found at the nearby Brimpton Airfield.\n\n"}

It was most active between 1999 and 2003, with reunion shows in 2005 and 2011. The band's core members were Andrew Broder, Martin Dosh, JG Everest and Bryan Olson.\n\nLateduster was considered a Minneapolis \"supergroup\" because all four members were active in other successful bands and projects. They were also considered pioneering in their combination of live and electronic instrumentation, and their unconventional use of instruments such as turntables, looping pedals, and fender rhodes electric piano in the \"post-rock\" genre. Lateduster composed and performed instrumental mood music with a combination of live drums, guitars, turntables, fender rhodes, and keys run through a myriad of effects and live looping pedals.\n\nFormed in Minneapolis in 1999, Lateduster was originally an instrumental sextet called Cropduster, with a symmetrical lineup of two guitars, two full drum kits and two DJs on four turntables. By the beginning of 2000, they had pared themselves down to a four-piece and began honing their sound into intricately arranged chamber music. In 2000, they recorded and released the first of three \"handmade\" EPs, independently released on their own Firetrunk Records label. In 2002, the best tracks from these early recordings were remastered and compiled on the first album \"Lateduster\", which included two newly recorded songs. During the summer and fall of 2002, Lateduster completed the second album \"Five Easy Pieces\", which was released on Firetrunk in 2002. Over the winter of 2002 to 2003, the band continued work on a new original soundtrack to the 1925 silent German Expressionist film \"Varieté\", which they had performed live at the Sound Unseen Film Festival in 2001. In 2003, Lateduster released the first DVD \"Plain Old Andrea, With A Gun\", a collaborative project with Alaska-born choreographer Emily Johnson and her contemporary dance company Catalyst.\n\nAfter three years of performing and recording, and self-releasing 5 CDs and a DVD, Lateduster went on hiatus in Spring 2003 after Andrew Broder left the group and Bryan Olson moved to San Francisco. The various members then went on to be part of several other music projects, Fog, Hymie's Basement, Dosh, Andrew Bird, Neotropic, Sans Le Systeme, The Cloak Ox, Roma di Luna, Vicious Vicious and the Catalyst dance company. In 2003, Merck Records discovered Lateduster’s music, and decided to do the first major label release of their music in fall 2004 as \"Easy Pieces\", a compilation of previously released material.\n\n\n"}

It was hosted by Terry Wogan and Gaby Roslin.\n\nThe opening titles featured Roslin dressed up like a movie star driven to the studio in a limo and walking on red carpet to the door. Meanwhile, Wogan, carrying a briefcase, rode a rickety old bicycle across London and parked it outside the back door before quietly entering the building through said back door.\n\nThe show was not well known for the guests who appeared on it, but rather for its many bloopers or double entendres (such as the instance when a number of various sized tennis balls were located around the studio to mark that year's Wimbledon tournament, and when introducing Pat Cash as a guest Roslin announced \"And I'm sure you can guess from the size of those balls who's coming up next!\")\n\nIntended to compete head-to-head with ITV1's \"This Morning\", it was much hyped before its launch. The first show included Jonathan Ross as its main guest.\n\nThe early episodes tried to capture the atmosphere of Wogan's BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. They even had a butler for Wogan, named Bulstrode, who in reality was one of the show's producers, usually there to serve him drinks (of the alcoholic kind).\n\nRoving reporter Danny McCall (a former \"Brookside\" actor) featured in a section called \"Live Loot\". From Monday to Thursday, he would go to a certain location in the UK and go to someone's house trying to get them to sell something to him. He had £100 each day to bribe them with. The first person he visited on the first show was future regular Danny Baker. On Friday, the four items collected over the week would be given away to viewers.\n\nThe show also featured a daily competition called \"Kids in Headphones\" in which a child of primary school age was shown with a pair of headphones on, singing along to a tune playing in the headphones. Viewers had to identify the tune to win a prize, with winners drawn at the end of the show. In later episodes, winners were put into a draw to win a television and a selection of DVDs, which gave rise to a crude running gag from Roslin about the size of the television. (\"42 inches! Oh boy!\")\n\nA regular on the show was Johnny Ball. At the beginning of each show from Monday to Thursday, he would take down three questions sent in by viewers and go off to research the answers. At the end of the show, he would come back and answer them. The third question always involved a rather more long-winded answer, explained using props.\n\nIn the autumn of 2003, Ball took a holiday, and was replaced by Danny Baker. The following Monday, Johnny returned, but on Tuesday Baker returned to take up the role permanently. He proceeded to make the slot his own, even adding a catchphrase (\"And now back to my friends!\"). He would answer three or four questions, and try and perform a silly trick or other gimmick instead of the prop answer that Johnny Ball did. In later episodes, if he ran out of time, he would put back questions to be answered on future shows. However, there was one question he kept putting back, forgetting to answer it the next day, and on every subsequent day; \"What is the world's most potent aphrodisiac?\"\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of the show's short history came when Baker placed a piece of soap in a microwave oven. Although an oven glove had been provided for protection, Baker failed to use it, resulting in him burning his hand when he took the plate out of the microwave to the great amusement of the audience, before removing the glass plate from the microwave which promptly shattered on the floor. The clip is a well-known out-take.\n\nThe show's ratings failed to match those of \"This Morning\", despite several tweaks to the format. The show also drew criticism for seemingly having someone other than the two hosts of the title presenting the show every other week. Embarrassingly, the show's highest ratings of all came when Wogan was not present, and Jimmy Tarbuck was hosting alongside Roslin. When Roslin was unavailable, she was usually replaced by Jenny Powell. The show was called \"Terry & Gaby\", but because of this guest host situation, it also became:\n\n\nThe low ratings finally led to the show being axed after 200 episodes. Another notable point, however, is that the only time the show ever made the news, was after its \"199\"th episode, on which Anne Robinson was a guest. This was supposedly her first television appearance since her much talked-about alleged facelift. Many observers noticed how different she looked from more recent programmes, and suggested that she'd had cosmetic surgery, which she denied. The next day, on the morning of the final episode, the story was all over the newspapers, some of them displaying \"before and after\" pictures of Anne on the front page, ensuring that at least the show didn't go out with a total whimper.\n\nThe last episode of The Terry & Gaby Show was broadcast on 26 March 2004. Hailed as yet another \"television flop\" by Chris Evans' production company UMTV, Evans himself had the last word. The last show ended with a shot of Evans standing at a market stall (called \"Chris's Fruit & Veg\"), eating an apple, and then turning to the camera, saying \"F*** it, we had a go, didn't we?\". This is a joke on the fact that when the show launched, Evans said he would return to running a fruit & veg stall if the program failed.\n\n"}

A spinoff of The Weather Channel, Weatherscan features uninterrupted local weather information in graphical format on a continuous loop that is generated by an IntelliStar unit installed at the cable provider's headend; unlike The Weather Channel, Weatherscan does not feature on-air talent of any kind.\n\nThe channel launched on March 31, 1999, as Weatherscan Local. Originally, Weatherscan operated five collective services for local weather information: Weatherscan Local featured animated weather information with a complete local weather segment every two minutes; Weatherscan Radar featured a continuous Doppler radar loop, along with severe weather advisories when warranted; Weatherscan Plus (debuted April 30, 1999) featured activity-specific forecasts for golf, skiing, boating, beachgoing, and business and leisure travel; Weatherscan Plus Traffic (May 31, 1999) featured the same format as Weatherscan Plus with the inclusion of traffic information; Weatherscan Español, which launched with Weatherscan Plus Traffic, was a Spanish-language version of Weatherscan Plus allowing regional or international weather information.\n\nThe IntelliStar unit used by Weatherscan is configured differently from that used by The Weather Channel, featuring different graphics and additional forecast products, with information running on a continuous basis. Vocal Local, a pre-recorded narration function installed in the IntelliStar system—which utilizes a different narration track than that used on The Weather Channel's Local on the 8s forecast segments, featuring a female announcer—introduces several of the segments.\n\nWeatherscan is available in many major markets around the United States, though its availability is not as widespread as that of parent network The Weather Channel. Many cable providers offer Weatherscan on their digital tiers, although a few providers carry Weatherscan on their basic tier (where The Weather Channel is also offered). In 2011, Dish Network became the first satellite provider to add Weatherscan.\n\nVerizon FiOS dropped Weatherscan, along with parent network The Weather Channel, from its lineup at 12:00 a.m. on March 10, 2015 after the two parties were unable to come to terms on a new carriage agreement. The service has been replaced by the local WeatherBug \"widget\" in some markets. No public announcement was made regarding this issue until over 12 hours after the discontinuation. Verizon said its reason for dropping the services was because many customers turn to the internet and mobile apps for weather any time of day.\n\nWhile the domestic IntelliStars were decommissioned and replaced by newer IntelliStar2 units on November 16, 2015, the modified IntelliStar units are currently still active for Weatherscan.\n\nWith the rise of online weather information available both on computers and on mobile devices, the channel has seen decreased relevance through the 2010s. Comcast removed the channel from its Xfinity systems throughout the third quarter of 2017.\n\nAs of 2020, the channel has mostly been discontinued on major cable providers, however some Weatherscan units are still in operation by smaller cable operators. It has largely been replaced in function with Local Now.\n\nOn March 22, 2018, Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios announced its intent to acquire The Weather Channel's television assets from an NBCUniversal/Blackstone Group partnership. The actual value is undisclosed, but was reported to be around $300 million; the channel's non-television assets, which were separately sold to IBM two years prior, were not included in the sale.\n\nWeatherscan displays a variety of forecast products that show different types of weather information, some of which are not included on certain providers.\nFrom 1999 during the early 2000s, when the channel's segments were generated mainly by WeatherStar XL systems, five different products could be chosen for display.\n\n\"Note: \"Domestic IntelliStar\" refers to STARs that output content for The Weather Channel.\"\n\nWhen Weatherscan Local debuted in 1999, the channel maintained a national feed that was used for satellite and smaller cable providers that could not afford a secondary and more technologically advanced WeatherStar system to use for a local Weatherscan feed. The national feed, branded as simply Weatherscan, debuted in July 1998, and ran current temperatures and extended forecasts for select cities throughout the United States, as well as national and regional radar images. There is uncertainty as to whether or not the national version was discontinued; however, since Weatherscan Local simplified its name to \"Weatherscan\" in 2003, it is likely the national feed was discontinued around that time.\n\nA new Weatherscan feed launched in June 29, 2011, for Dish Network subscribers, replacing the short-lived service The Weather Cast that had been founded as a replacement for The Weather Channel as a result of a May 2010 carriage dispute with the satellite provider; the Weatherscan feed provides regionalized information for cities within 125 miles of a given area, and is delivered in the same manner as the Weatherscan systems on cable providers. Weatherscan was dropped on June 24, 2015, while WeatherNation took place for regional viewers.\n\n"}

The Foudry Brook, a tributary of the Kennet, and the Reading–Basingstoke railway line, run through the north of the parish.\n\nBeech Hill was originally part of the parish of Stratfield Saye, a cross-county-border parish, most of which was in Hampshire. The Berkshire part became a civil parish in its own right in 1894. In the 16th century, it was part of the hundred of Theale, but was later transferred to the hundred of Reading which effectively ceased to function after 1886. By 1875, Beech Hill had become part of the Bradfield rural sanitary district which, in 1894, became the Bradfield Rural District.

His father, János Orbán, Baron of Lengyelfalva (1779-1871) was a parliamentarian, who during the French wars was an army officer; his mother was Eugénia Knechtel (1810-1883). According to Balázs Orbán’s memoir, he was a descendant of a family half Upper Hungarian, half Italian (or Greek) from Istanbul. The Baron title was given by Maria Theresa to the great-grandfather of Balázs Orbán, Elek Orbán von Lengyelfalva on the 13th of November 1744.\n\nHe completed his schooling in Székelyudvarhely, first to a catholic then to a reformed grammar school as he could learn ancient Greek, Math, and History there, but he had left his homeland already in the summer of 1846. He and his family traveled to Constantinople to receive the heritage of his grandmother, Mária Foresti, who was descended from Venice and probably poisoned by Muslims. After long lawsuits he only received a small part of the fabulous fortune, so he learned the craft of watchmaking. Taking the opportunity, he traveled around the Near East. He had got to Egypt, where he climbed the pyramids, in the Holy Land visited the biblical places, met a lot of Hungarian and Romanian “Bedouin” from Transylvania, who escaped the military conscription, traveled around Asia Minor, studied the ancient Greek cultural remains, wrote admiringly about the revolution of the Greek people. He later published his Eastern adventures in six volumes, entitled Traveling in the East. As a result of what he has seen here, he had adopted strongly anti-clerical views, which he has voiced in several of his works.\n\nHe learned about the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 from a Western newspaper in Athens. He left the Ottoman capital with a military unit of volunteers but learned of the fall of the War of Independence in Vidin. He then helped the Hungarian emigrants with accommodation and work. It was a decisive experience of his later life that he was in the surroundings of Kossuth. He could not return home, because he was considered as an enemy by the Habsburg imperial authorities. He traveled to London, where he met Petőfi's friend, Sándor Teleki. He was greatly influenced by Victor Hugo, who migrated to Jersey and then to Guernsey, who said that “I could overthrow The Empire of Napoleon the 3rd with 200 Balázs Orbáns”. He could not return home until 1859. He used the years of absolutism, the period of relief, to travel around the Székely Land. He visited all the settlements, castle ruins, natural rarities. He made notes and photographs diligently. As a result of his work, between 1868 and 1873 he published his main work in six volumes, entitled The description of the Székely Land in historical, archaeological, natural and ethnographic terms.\n\nFrom 1872 to the end of his life he was a member of the Hungarian Parliament, and with the independence program of 1848, he belonged to the opposition. He published his speeches in six volumes as well. Meanwhile, he worked on Szejkefürdő that he built, writing historical studies and publishing numerous newspaper articles in opposition papers.His life was adventurous and romantic, like a hero of Mór Jókai. But this novel was not written, although Mór Jókai first heard the base stories of the Székely novels from him. At the same time, there were downsides to his life as well. He was blackballed by Székelys at the time of the elections, they did not always agree with the “bone Baron”. As a late acknowledgment, it was not until 1888 that he became a correspondent member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He died without any descendants.\n\nHe made his only heirs the Hungarians, and more specifically the Székely people, but there were long lawsuits over his legacy. At his funeral was decided that he deserves a statue, but it had to wait more than a century until 1995. According to his will, he was buried in Szejkefürdő. A row of was put up in front of his grave, the last of which was his.\n\nIn Székelykeresztúr a school, in Székelyudvarhely a school and a photography club are named after him. The Council of Hargita (\"Harghita\"), Kovászna (\"Covasna\") and Maros (\"Mureş\") County established the Balázs Orbán Prize in 2011, which is awarded to individuals who have earned indelible merits in creating a unified image of Székely Land and modernizing it based on the specific traditions of the region.\n\nBalázs Orbán Cave is the name of one of the caves of the Varghis Gorge Nature Reserve.\n\n\nBalázs Orbán's family tree\n\n1.    familysearch.org Balázs Orbán’s obituary\n\n2.    familysearch.org János Orbán’s obituary\n\n3.    familysearch.org Eugénia Knechtel Orbán Jánosné’s obituary\n\n4.    120 - Hungarian Chancellery Archives - Acta miscellanea - F. 9 - Orbán\n\n5.    Péter Balogh: Székely Lives.

After leaving school he went to Walton Technical College to train as an electrician. Jackson was inspired by the skiffle sound of Lonnie Donegan, and then by Buddy Holly and other U.S. rock and rollers. He founded the skiffle group the Martinis.\n\nNicknamed Black Jake, he joined the guitar duo the Searchers, which had been formed by John McNally and Mike Pender in 1959. The band soon expanded further to a quartet with the addition of the drummer Chris Curtis. Jackson built and learned to play a customised bass guitar. Learning his new job on the four-stringed instrument proved too difficult to permit him to continue singing lead so he made way for a new singer, Johnny Sandon, in 1960. They played in Liverpool's nightclubs and the beer bars of Hamburg, Germany. Brian Epstein considered signing them but he lost interest after seeing a drunken Jackson fall off the stage at the Cavern Club. Sandon moved on in February 1962 and the band were signed by Pye Records in mid-1963 when the Beatles' success created demand for Liverpudlian acts.\n\nJackson was lead singer and played bass on the band's first two United Kingdom hits, \"Sweets for My Sweet\" and \"Sugar and Spice\", but was not the vocalist on the band's biggest hit \"Needles and Pins\". He was featured on both \"Don't Throw Your Love Away\" and \"Love Potion No. 9\".\n\nIn 1964 the band toured the United States, including an appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Jackson was unhappy with the band's move away from rock and roll to a softer, more melodic sound and felt that he was not getting appropriate attention. He left the group in July 1964 in some acrimony and immediately moved to London and put together a new band, the Vibrations, which had an organ-based sound instead of the Searchers' guitar based one.\n\nAfter leaving the Searchers Jackson spent £200 () on cosmetic surgery on his nose. He said at the time that he had had a lifelong complex about his nose to the extent that he could not mix socially. The surgery had followed psychiatric treatment. That same year he revealed that his 1960 marriage to Margaret Parry had been effectively over for two years.\n\nThe Vibrations toured the UK with the Hollies, Marianne Faithfull and other acts. They released four singles on the Pye Records label but only the first had any success. In 1965 they changed their name to the Tony Jackson Group but the fourth single also failed and Pye dropped them. The band then signed to CBS without improvement and they found that there were few bookings in the UK so they toured southern Europe until even that withered. Disillusioned and out of options, Jackson left the music business.\n\nJackson took a variety of jobs including Spanish night club manager, entertainments representative, furniture salesman, disc jockey and golf club manager. In the 1980s he tried to establish a Searchers revival band, but was unable to compete effectively with the other two that already existed.\n\nIn 1991, Tony Jackson and the Vibrations reformed and an album of Jackson's material after the Searchers was released. The resuscitation of his career was short-lived, however, although he did appear four times with Mike Pender's Searchers between 1992 and 1995. That ended in 1996 when he was convicted of threatening a woman with an air pistol after an argument over a phone booth, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.\n\nThe arthritis in his hands became so bad that he had to abandon even recreational guitar playing.

After graduating from Chaminade High School in Mineola he played college basketball at Holy Cross and with Bob Cousy was on the team that won the 1947 NCAA Championship. He played briefly for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association.\n\nAfter college, Mullaney was with the FBI before returning to basketball as coach at Norwich University in Vermont.\n\nMullaney became head basketball coach at Providence College in 1955. He coached the Friars until 1969, returning in 1981, remaining until 1985. Mullaney went 319-164 during his 18 seasons, a winning percentage of .660. Mullaney won the 1961 and 1963 National Invitation Tournament championships at Providence. Mullaney also took the Friars to the NIT four other times and into the NCAA tournament three times. His assistant and protégé at Providence, Dave Gavitt, went on to be a successful coach of the Friars, taking them to the 1973 Final Four and eventually help founding of the Big East Conference.\n\nMullaney left Providence in 1969 to coach the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association, succeeding Butch van Breda Kolff who took the Lakers to the NBA Finals that year, losing 4-3 to the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn the 1969–70 season the Lakers overcame several injury problems and finished 46-36, two games behind the first-place Atlanta Hawks in the Western Division. Wilt Chamberlain was lost to injury early in the season and Elgin Baylor was also lost to injury later; both returned in time for the playoffs. En route to the NBA Finals they defeated the Phoenix Suns in the division semifinals and Atlanta in the division finals. The Lakers lost the NBA Finals 4-3 to the New York Knicks.\n\nIn the 1970–71 season the Lakers finished 48-34, first in the new Pacific Division. The Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinal but lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nIn 1971 Mullaney became the fifth coach of the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association, succeeding Frank Ramsey in 1971. Mullaney coached the Colonels for two seasons before Babe McCarthy succeeded him for the 1973–74 season.\n\nIn the 1971–72 season the talent-laden Colonels finished with a remarkable record of 68-16, the best ever record in the history of the ABA, winning the Eastern Division. Incredibly, the Colonels lost the 1972 Eastern Division Semifinals to the 44-40 New York Nets, 4-2. Mullaney coached the East team to a 142-115 win in the ABA All Star game that season.\n\nIn the 1972–73 season the Colonels finished 56-28, good for 2nd in the Eastern Division. The Colonels beat the Virginia Squires 4-1 in the Eastern Division Semifinals, beat the Carolina Cougars 4-3 in the Eastern Division Finals, and lost the ABA Finals 4-3 to the Indiana Pacers.\n\nAfter the 1972–73 season Mullaney left the Colonels to coach the Utah Stars.\n\nDuring the 1973–74 season Mullaney coached the Utah Stars to a 51-33 record, finishing 1st in the Western Division. The Stars defeated the San Diego Conquistadors 4-2 in the 1974 Western Division Semifinals and the Indiana Pacers 4-3 in the 1974 Western Division Finals, losing the 1974 ABA Finals to the New York Nets 4-1. Mullaney coached the West in the 1974 ABA All-Star Game, losing to the McCarthy-coached East 128-112. Mullaney was replaced as coach of the Stars by Morris \"Bucky\" Buckwalter after that season in Utah.\n\nDuring the 1974–75 season Mullaney coached the Memphis Sounds, finishing with a record of 27-57 and 4th place in the Eastern Division. Their season was ended by Mullaney's old team, the Kentucky Colonels, en route to the Colonels' 1975 ABA Championship.\n\nAt the start of the 1975–1976 season Mullaney was the coach of the Baltimore Claws but the team folded after a few preseason exhibition games. \n\nIn December 1975 Mullaney became coach of the Spirits of St. Louis. Mullaney took the helm in St. Louis in midseason after the team opened with a 20-27 record under coach Rod Thorn. Mullaney was the final coach of the Spirits of St. Louis, as at the end of the 1975–1976 season the Spirits, along with the Kentucky Colonels, were the only two ABA teams that did not join the NBA in the ABA–NBA merger.\n\nAfter the 1975–76 season Mullaney coached the Buffalo Braves of the NBA. Mullaney was brought on board by the Braves' new owner, John Y. Brown Jr., who had previously had an ownership interest in Mullaney's old team, the Kentucky Colonels. Despite Adrian Dantley earning Rookie of the Year the Braves finished in 4th with a 30-52 record.\n\nMullaney coached in Italy and then for Brown University from 1978 through 1981.\n\nMullaney died of cancer in Providence, Rhode Island on March 8, 2000, aged 75. He is buried in East Greenwich, Rhode Island.\n"}

Radical ions are encountered in organic chemistry as reactive intermediates and in mass spectrometry as gas phase ions. Positive radical ions are called radical cations whereas negative radical ions are called radical anions.\n\nIn organic chemistry, a radical ion is typically indicated by a superscript dot followed by the sign of the charge: formula_1 and formula_2. In mass spectrometry, the sign is written first, followed by the superscripted dot: formula_3 and formula_4.\n\nMany aromatic compounds can undergo one-electron reduction by alkali metals. For example, the reaction of naphthalene with sodium in an aprotic solvent yields the naphthalene radical anion - sodium ion salt. In an ESR spectrum this compound shows up as a quintet of quintets (25 lines). In the presence of a proton source the radical anion is protonated and effectively hydrogenated as in the Birch reduction.\n\nThe electron is transferred from the alkali metal ion to an unoccupied antibonding p-p п* orbital of the aromatic molecule. This transfer is usually only energetically favorable if the aprotic solvent efficiently solvates the alkali metal ion. Effectiveness for this is in the order diethyl ether < THF < 1,2-dimethoxyethane < HMPA. In principle any unsaturated molecule can form a radical anion, but the antibonding orbitals are only energetically accessible in more extensive conjugated systems. Ease of formation is in the order benzene < naphthalene < anthracene < pyrene, etc. On addition of a proton source, the structure of the resulting hydrogenated molecule is defined by the charge distribution of the radical anion. For instance, the anthracene radical anion forms mainly (but not exclusively) 9,10-dihydroanthracene.\n\nAn example of a non-carbon radical anion is the superoxide anion, formed by transfer of one electron to an oxygen molecule.\n\nA very effective way to remove any traces of water from THF is by reflux with sodium wire in the presence of a small amount of benzophenone. Benzophenone is reduced to the ketyl radical anion by sodium which gives the THF solution an intense blue color. However, any trace of water in THF will further reduce the ketyl to the colourless alcohol. In this way, the color of the THF signals the dryness and the distilled THF contains less than 10 ppm of water. This treatment also effectively removes any peroxides in the THF. Radical anions of this type are also involved in the Acyloin condensation.\n\nCyclooctatetraene is reduced by elemental potassium all the way to the dianion because the 10 electron system is aromatic. Quinone is reduced to a semiquinone radical anion. Semidiones are derived from the reduction of dicarbonyl compounds.\n\nCationic radical species are much less stable. They appear prominently in the mass spectrometry. When a gas-phase molecule is subjected to electron ionization one electron is abstracted by an electron in the electron beam to create a radical cation M. This species represents the molecular ion or parent ion. A typical mass spectrum shows multiple signals because the molecular ion fragments into a complex mixture of ions and uncharged radical species. For example, the methanol radical cation fragments into a methenium cation CH and a hydroxyl radical. In naphthalene the unfragmented radical cation is by far the most prominent peak in the mass spectrum. Secondary species are generated from proton gain (M+1) and proton loss (M-1).\n\nSome compounds containing the dioxygenyl cation can be prepared in bulk.\n\nRadical cations figure prominently in the chemistry and properties of conducting polymers. Such polymers are formed by the oxidation of heterocycles to give radical cations, which condense with the parent heterocycle. For example, polypyrrole is prepared by oxidation of pyrrole using ferric chloride in methanol:\nOnce formed, these polymers become conductive upon oxidation. Polarons and bipolarons are radical cations encountered in doped conducting polymers.\n"}

{"id": "1926173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926173", "title": "First Army (Bulgaria)", "text": "First Army (Bulgaria)\n\nThe Bulgarian First Army was a Bulgarian field army during the Balkan Wars, World War I and World War II.\n\nFollowing the military reforms of 1907 the territory of the Bulgarian Kingdom was divided into three Army Inspectorates. Each of them was further divided into three division districts and in war time formed a field army.\n\nThe First Army was formed by the First Army Inspectorate, which had its headquarters in Sofia and controlled the First, Sixth and Seventh divisions. However, because of different circumstances the 7th and 6th divisions were detached from the First Army and replaced by the 3rd and newly formed 10th division, which were otherwise part of the Second Army Inspectorate. Thus after the declaration of general mobilization in September 1912 the army consisted of three infantry division and a cavalry regiment. However, only the 3rd division had its full wartime strength of three infantry brigades while the 10th division was formed by one brigade from the 1st division and another one from the 6th division. Hence it was called the \"Mixed\" division.\n\nThe order of battle on 4 of October 1912 O.S. was as follows:\n\nThe Bulgarian plan placed the First Army commanded by Lieutenant General Vasil Kutinchev in the center of the battle line and its task was to advance rapidly, engage the main Ottoman forces positioned between Kirk Kilisse and Adrianople and position itself so it could assist both the Second Army on the right flank and the Third Army on the left flank. To achieve this as soon as the advance began the 1st Brigade of the 3rd division was temporary assigned to the Second Army while the rest of the army advanced in the space between the two fortresses. In the ensuing Battle of Kirk Kilisse, in which the Ottoman Eastern Army was defeated and retreated, the First Army bore the brunt of the fighting and suffered the greater part of the 5,745 Bulgarian casualties in that battle. The Bulgarian command ordered a couple of days' rest so that the forces can regroup before pursuing the enemy.\n\nWhen the advance was renewed the First Army left behind the entire 3rd division around Adrianople to protect against attacks from the right flank. The Ottoman Army meanwhile had consolidated and reinforced itself on a new line from Lule Burgas to Bunar Hisar. The Bulgarians decided to carry out a frontal assault with the Third Army while the weakened First Army tried to enveloped the Ottoman left flank. This largest and bloodiest battle of the Balkan Wars the Bulgarians again emerged victorious and the Ottoman forces retreated in complete disorder. The heavy fighting inflicted around 20,000 casualties to the Bulgarian forces which again forced the Bulgarian command to order a couple of days' rest for the armies.\n\nBy the time the Bulgarians continued the advance the Ottoman Army had occupied the Chataldzha defensive line where it finally managed to hold its opponent after the battle on 4 and 5 November 1912.\n\nThe First and Third Bulgarian armies remained at the Chataldzha line until the end of the war and managed to repel several Ottoman attempted breakthroughs.\n\nIn the aftermath of the First Balkan War the tensions between the allies grew significantly, as Bulgaria felt cheated out of its rightful share by Serbia and Greece. After a surprise attack ordered by Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance directed against Bulgaria and the skirmishes between their troops and the much smaller Bulgarian forces that were left behind to protect their country's claims were becoming ever more frequent. In view of this situation the Bulgarian command began transferring its forces from Eastern Thrace to the western part of the country. During this time the organization of the field armies went through some major changes, including the creation of several new brigades and the formation of a new field army.\n\nThe First Army, still under the command of Lieutenant General Vasil Kutinchev, was deployed in the northwestern part of the country between Vidin and Berkovitsa, along the old border with Serbia. Its composition had changed significantly by 15 June 1913 and included two divisions, each with only two brigades, a few cavalry squadrons and an independent infantry brigade.\n\nThe Bulgarians planned to begin the war with an offensive in which the First and Third armies were to advance deep into Old Serbia and cut the communication and supply lines of the Serbian Army concentrated in Macedonia.\n\nThe conflict, however, began on 16 June 1913 when only the Fourth and Second armies were ordered to attack the Serbian and Greek armies. In the ensuing confusion for almost one week the remaining three Bulgarian armies received no orders to attack. It was only on the evening of 21 June when the First Army was ordered to advance against the town of Knjaževac and after it had occupied it to divide its forces in two with one part to be directed against Zaječar and the other one send to assist the Third army around Pirot.\n\nFacing the First Army was the Timok Army of 31 battalions and 12 gun batteries—mostly third line infantry, commanded by colonel Vukuman Arachich. The Bulgarians managed to defeat part of these forces and occupy Knjaževac while suffering only 280 men killed and 820 men wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Romania had declared war on Bulgaria and its army had begun invading the northern part of the country. This new enemy threatened the rear of the First Army and forced the Bulgarian high command to order its retreat back to the border.\nThat move had a very negative effect on the morale of the troops and even caused opened mutinies in the Ninth Division which became completely disorganized during the retreat. The situation was particularly bad in the division's Second Brigade which surrendered to the Romanian forces around Montana. The rest of the Ninth managed to retreat to Sofia and later form the Samokov detachment which took an important part in the Battle of Kresna Gorge. The rest of the army also retreated towards Sofia and took defensive positions in the Balkan mountain passes. The Serbians took advantage of this and occupied Belogradchik where they established contact with the Romanian Army. Even though by now most of northwestern Bulgaria was lost, General Kutinchev kept a few battalions in the fortress of Vidin which managed to hold off all Serbian attacks until the end of the war.\n\nThe Bulgarian high command now planned a decisive offensive operation against the Greek Army which was advancing in the Kresna Gorge. For that purpose Lieutenant General Vasil Kutinchev was assigned commander of the Second Army and the units of the First Army were transferred south to reinforce it.\n\nA general armistice was concluded on 18 July 1913 and ten days later the Treaty of Bucharest, which stipulated immediate demobilization of the Bulgarian Army, was signed.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Great War Bulgaria declared neutrality, as it still hadn't recovered from the losses suffered in the Balkan Wars. In 1915 activities in the diplomatic arena intensified and both the Entente and the Central powers tried to win new allies, especially in the Balkans. Bulgaria's main aim was to regain Macedonia but Serbia was unwilling to make any compromises which gave the German diplomacy a great advantage. The general military situation also favored the Central Powers—the Germans were holding firm on the Western Front and on the Eastern Front their Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive ended in major defeat for the Russians. Under these circumstances on 6 September (24 August) 1915 at the German military headquarters in Pleß Bulgaria and Germany signed a treaty of alliance. A military convention, which included Austria-Hungary as a third party and laid the plan for the conquest of Serbia, was also concluded.\n\nIn accordance with the convention Bulgaria began mobilizing and concentrating its forces its western border. For the campaign the Bulgarian high command planned to attack Serbia with two armies. The First Army under the command of Lieutenant General Kliment Boyadzhiev was deployed between the Danube and Tran. As stipulated by the military convention it was part of Army Group Mackensen together with the German Eleventh Army and the Austro-Hungarian Third Army.\n\nOn 1 October(14 October) 1915 the army had the following organization:\n\nThe Serbians were informed about the Bulgarian war preparations by their military attaché in Sofia and the units covering the border between the two countries. Once Bulgaria declared mobilization the Serbian High Command planned a preemptive strike against the Bulgarian forces who were still concentrating and organizing on the border. For that purpose it deployed the entire Second Army, the Timok Army, the Kraina detachment and the Vlasinski detachment against the sector of the Bulgarian First Army. These were sizable forces of around 100 battalions with 90,000 rifleman, 248 cannons and 94 machine guns. In addition the Serbians also had a defensive alliance with Greece and hoped the Greek Army would also intervene. The Serbs have also asked the Entente for assistance in the form of a 150,000 strong army. Although the Entente couldn't provide the troops the Serbian army was prepared to attack Bulgaria. However, the Serb Prime Minister Pašić did not dare to attack Bulgaria over explicit opposition of all the Allied Powers (Russia, France and Great Britain).\n\nOn 1 October(14 October) 1915 Bulgaria declared war on Serbia and the First Army was ordered to begin its Morava Offensive. Its primary objectives were to push the Serbian forces out of the Timok and Morava valleys, to link up with Austro-Hungarian forces advancing from Orșova and secure the Belgrade—Sofia railway by capturing Niš, war-time capital of Serbia.\n\nThe Bulgarian Army crossed the border on October 11. But the first two weeks of the offensive the advance was slow as the divisions of the army operated independently towards achieving their individual objectives. In the southern sector the \"Sofia\" infantry division was engaged in heavy fighting with parts of the Serbian Second Army and failed to take Pirot. However, the Bulgarian advance in the north was proceeding more rapidly and the taking of Knjaževac by the \"Tundzha\" division eventually forced the Serbians to pull out of Pirot in order to avoid encirclement. This was a minor success for the Bulgarians which captured 14 cannons and c. 1,500 prisoners but the main Serbian forces were allowed to retreat in good order.\n\nFaced with the war on several fronts the Serbian High Command decided that it is best for the army to try to hold its opponents for as long as possible and retreat slowly to the south, southwest until help arrived from the Allies who had landed in Thessaloniki. Under these circumstances the renewed drive of the Bulgarian Army faced determined resistance but it was not enough to prevent the fall of Aleksinac and on 23 October (5 November) 1915 the 9th \"Pleven\" division entered Niš where the Serbians had left some 42 old fortress cannons, several thousand rifles and a big amount of ammunitions, in addition around 5,000 soldiers surrendered or were captured by the Bulgarians. The Belgrade–Sofia railway was now opened for the Central Powers and a permanent land connection was established. The Serbians, however, managed to destroy the bridges of the Morava river and slowed significantly the Bulgarian First Army which spend the time between 24 and 31 October in unsuccessful attempts to cross the river. This marked the end of the Morava Offensive.\n\nHaving suffered heavy losses the Serbian Army retreated towards Kosovo where they prepared to make their last stand. The Central Powers meanwhile prepared a plan to encircle the Serbian forces. The Bulgarian High Command and the headquarters of Army Group \"Mackensen\" agreed to pursue relentlessly the retreating opponent, to cut its possible retreat routes through Macedonia and to undertake a decisive advance towards Pristina and prevent a Serbian retreat to the west. The plan required the Bulgarian First Army to attack from the east, a detached part of the Second Bulgarian Army from the South, the Eleventh army from the north and finally the main forces of the Third Army from the northwest while its XIX Army Corps blocks any Serbian retreat to the west. However, after the fall of Niš the Germans began pulling out some of their forces from the Balkans and the Bulgarian Sixth and Ninth divisions had been slowed by the swollen waters of the Morava and the destruction of its bridges. In these circumstances on 1 November the Central Powers began the Kosovo Offensive.\n\nContrary to the intentions of generalfeldmarschall Mackensen the advance of his army group proved to be difficult and slow due to bad roads, lack of supplies and the cold weather. This allowed the Serbians to gradually retreat in good order further into Kosovo and to concentrate greater forces against the Northern Operations Group of the Second Bulgarian Army in an attempt to break through and join the French and British forces advancing up the Vardar valley. In view of these events on 6 November the 8th \"Tundzha\" division left the First Army and was placed under the command of the Northern Operations Group while the 6th \"Bdin\" division was ordered to redeploy around Blagoevgrad and Dupnitsa under the direct control of the Bulgarian high command. The exhausted Serbians failed to achieve their aims and in the face of the continued advance of the Bulgarian forces towards Pristina from the east and the south ordered a general withdrawal . On 10 November the 9th \"Pleven\" division and the German 101st division entered the town but the successful retreat of the Serbian Army on the right bank of the river Sitnica meant that its attempted encirclement had failed. This ended the second phase of the campaign.\n\nAfter the defeat in Kosovo the remnants of the Serbian Army began its retreat through Albania to the Adriatic coast. The Germans thought that the campaign was over and continued pulling out their troops from the front while the pursuit of the retreating opponent was left mostly to Bulgarian and Austro-Hungarian forces. On 24 November the 3rd \"Balkan\" division took Prizren and was placed under the command of the First Army. With the end of the campaign a general order for the regrouping of all Bulgarian forces was issued. The 9th division was moved to the Skopje-Prilep area, the 1st \"Sofia\" division was ordered to concentrate around Kratovo, where it would remain under the direct control of the Bulgarian high command. The cavalry division and the 8th \"Tunzha\" infantry division were also ordered to join the First Army.\n\nWith the successful conclusion of the Serbian campaign and withdrawal of the French and British expeditionary forces back to Salonika the Bulgarian armies reached the Greek border. Under the influence of the German high command they were ordered not to cross into Greek territory. The Bulgarian commander-in-chief general Nikola Zhekov remained concerned about the increasing Allied presence in Greece and insisted upon an attack on Salonika. Instead on 9 February 1916 during a meeting in the German military headquarters in Pleß he and the Chief of the General Staff von Falkenhayn agreed to begin fortifying the positions that were already taken on the Greek border and to resolve the question of an offensive latter.\n\nSince December 1915 the Bulgarian First Army consisted of the 8th, 9th and 3rd infantry divisions and the cavalry divisions and occupied a 140-kilometer front, from Debar and Struga to the bend of the river Cherna and the Vardar. It remained part of Army Group \"Mackensen\", which had its headquarters in Skopje, together with the Bulgarian 5th \"Danube\" division, the German 4th Reserve Corps and the German 210th composite brigade which formed the Eleventh Army.\n\nIn the spring of 1916 as the Allies had finished fortifying the area around Salonica and it became obvious that no Bulgarian and German offensive was going to take place, the French and British forces moved up to the Greek border where they established contact with the Bulgarian forces. In the beginning of April the positions of the Eleventh Army were subjected to heavy artillery shelling and field marshal Mackensen requested the 9th \"Pleven\" infantry division to be given to that army so that it can consolidate its position. General Zhekov agreed and ordered the division to leave the First Army, join the Eleventh Army and concentrate behind the German 4th Corps.\n\nBy 1 June the Entente forces were additionally strengthened by the arrival of some 115,488 Serbian soldiers, which were organized in three corps-sized formations called armies. The Allies now had over 313,000 troops in the theater which increased the Bulgarian concerns. By July Romania was preparing to enter the war on the side of the Entente which placed Bulgaria in a difficult position facing a possible war on two fronts and in the beginning of August the French and British launched an offensive against the Bulgarian positions at Lake Dojran which convinced the Bulgarian high command that the Allies were preparing a general offensive. To counter these negative developments the Bulgarians planned an offensive of their own with both their flanks aiming to shorten the front line and influence Romania in its decision to enter the war.\n\nThe advance on the right flank was to be undertaken by the Bulgarian First Army which had the following order of battle in July 1916:\n\nThe Germans finally agreed that an offensive was needed and on 12 August general Boyadzhiev received his orders from the headquarters of Army Group \"Mackensen\". The right wing of the army, consisting of the reinforced 8th infantry division (four and half infantry brigades) was to advance and take Florina while parts of the 3rd division towards the Chegan mountain range and the village of the same name. General Boyadzhiev agreed to attack but had concerns regarding the final results of the offensive because his army was scattered on a 140 km front and lacked enough mountain and heavy artillery.\nFacing the Bulgarians were the six infantry and one cavalry divisions of the three Serbian armies.\n\nThe offensive began on 17 August 1916 with the Bulgarians taking Florina (Lerin), Banitsa and Kastoria. The advance, however, soon ran into difficulty and slowed down considerably due to the increased Serbian resistance. The fighting was especially heavy on the bare rocky slopes of the Chegan Mountain and the Nidže. The Serbians were constantly reinforced with new artillery and fresh troops thanks to railway that reached the battlefield while the Bulgarians soon began depleting their ammunition stocks. This and the slow advance forced the Bulgarian high command to call off all attacks on 27 August and order the forces to dig in on the occupied positions between Lake Ostrovo, Lake Petrovsko and along the ridges of the Nidže. For the next several days the Bulgarian positions were subjected to heavy artillery fire and few Serbian attacks that were repulsed. The so-called Chegan Offensive, also known as the Lerin Offensive, had failed. It failed to influence Romania, which entered the war on the side of the Allies but also failed to achieve its final military objective to take the Chegan village and the pass north of Lake Ostrovo.\n\nGeneral Maurice Sarrail now prepared a counterattack against the First Bulgarian Army that would eventually develop in the Monastir Offensive. The blow was to be directed against the right wing of the First Army which consisted of the Third infantry brigade of the 6th \"Bdin\" division, the Third cavalry brigade and the 8th \"Tundzha\" and First infantry brigade of the Third \"Balkan\" infantry division or in total about 36 infantry battalions, 74 machine guns and 35 artillery batteries. Against them were arrayed the Serbian Third Army and the divisional group of general Cordonnier.\n\nThe offensive began with the battle of Malka Nidzhe on 12 September 1916. After two days of fighting the Serbians achieved a breakthrough around Gornichevo and forced the Bulgarian 8th division to retreat. Meanwhile, the battle for Kajmakcalan also began. The fall of Florina on 23 September and the retreat of the Bulgarian First Army forced some changes in the Central Powers command structure. On 27 September general Kliment Boyadzhiev was replaced as commander of the First Army by general Dimitar Geshov. The Army itself exchanged headquarters with the Eleventh Army, now under the command of general Arnold von Winckler, and came under the new Army Group \"Below\", replacing Army Group \"Mackensen\" which was dissolved on the Macedonian Front on 30 July 1916 as field marshal Mackensen was needed in northern Bulgaria to take command of the forces concentrating for the operations against Romania. The former units of the First Army, now under German command, continued fighting around Monastir till December when the Allied offensive was finally halted.\n\nThe new Bulgarian First Army now consisted of the Fifth \"Danube\" Infantry Division on the western bank of the Vardar, the Ninth \"Pleven\" Infantry Division between the Vardar and Lake Dojran, one brigade from the Eleventh \"Macedonian\" Infantry Division from Lake Dojran to the Belasica Mountain. For the rest of 1916 its sector saw only secondary fighting.\n\nOn 21 April 1917 general Otto von Below was called to the Western Front and was replaced by general Friedrich von Scholtz who established a new army group bearing his name and composed of the Eleventh and First armies.\nDuring that time general Maurice Sarrail attempted a new offensive aiming to break the Macedonian front. The British were the first to attack the Ninth \"Pleven\" Division around Lake Dojran on 22 April. They were followed by the Serbians and the French who attack through the Cherna Loop in May. This offensive, however, proved a big disappointment as the French who took the Yarebichina peak from the Fifth \"Danube\" Division were driven back by the Bulgarians and the British suffered a heavy defeat in the Second Battle of Dojran. By 23 May the offensive was cancelled and the Allies began fortifying their positions in expectation of a Bulgarian counter-offensive which never came. Then for a period of almost one year there were only a few local actions along the entire front.\n\nBy 1918 the Bulgarian positions in Macedonia had deteriorated drastically as the morale of the forces decreased due to lack of supplies and ammunition. Then in May the positions of the First Army in the sector of the Fifth Division were attacked by the Greek Army, which had officially joined the Allied forces in 1917. In the ensuing Battle of Skra-di-Legen at the peak of Yarebichina the Bulgarians lost almost their entire 49th Infantry Regiment. This victory was of little strategic value to the Allies but it sapped the morale of the Bulgarian troops in the sector. After the battle general Nikola Zhekov, general Sholtz and crown prince Boris arrived at the headquarters of the Fifth Division to inquire for the causes of the defeat. They reinforced the division with the 80th infantry regiment and planned a demonstrative attack along the Struma by the Second Army in order to retake the heights. The plan, however, never went into action as the morale of the forces in the Fifth Division was so low that an attack was impossible. General Zhekov then sought to remedy the situations by replacing the commander of the First Army general Dimitar Geshov with the former commander of the Ninth \"Pleven\" Division general Stefan Nerezov.\n\nMorale in some parts of the front, however, remained critical as news about German misfortunes in the Western Front reached the troops on the Balkans the few remaining German troops in Macedonia were being pulled out and the deprivations in the Bulgarian Army continued. The new commander of the Allied Salonica forces Franchet d'Espèrey planned to take advantage of this by organizing a new great offensive in Macedonia. For that purpose he gathered a force of 28 divisions or between 670,000 and 717,000 men with over 2,000 artillery pieces, 2609 machine guns and 200 airplanes. The main blow was to be delivered against the German Eleventh Army, which by now consisted almost entirely by Bulgarian units at Dobro Pole, with secondary attacks to the west around Bitola and to the east against the Bulgarian First Army at Lake Doiran .\n\nIn September 1918 the First Army had the following order of battle:\n\nFor the operations against the Bulgarian First Army the Allied command designated the forces of general Milne. Those consisted of 4 British and 2 Greek infantry divisions or about 66 battalions with 300 artillery pieces and 400 machine guns. General Milne decided to deliver his main blow against the 9th Division while a secondary attack was planned against the 1st brigade of the 11th Infantry Division.\n\nThe Allied Vardar Offensive opened on 15 September 1918 with the Battle of Dobro Pole and after a relative short struggle a breakthrough was achieved. On the next day at Lake Doiran the Allies began a two-day artillery barrage in which more than 300,000 ordinary and gas shells were fired on the Bulgarian positions. Unlike at Dobro Pole, however, the troops in the Doiran sector preserved their high morale due to the personal inspection of the battlefield that the army commander general Nerezov made and the skilful leadership of the commander of the division general Vladimir Vazov. In addition the two commanders had regrouped their forces in such a way that a sufficient reserve of two regiments was immediately available. The modern and well build fortifications also made the casualties from the barrage extremely low. So when the Allied infantry began advancing the Bulgarians were ready to meet them with all their available forces. The result was a two-day bloody battle in which the British and Greeks suffered a heavy defeat. In fact the victory was so encouraging that general Nerezov was preparing for a counter-attack with his army supported by the neighboring Second Army which until now had remained completely inactive. In addition he could also rely on the Fourth Army, further down the Struma. In this decisive moment on 19 September the acting commander-in-chief general Georgi Todorov met with general Friedrich von Scholtz to decide what to do. The question of a counter offensive with the right wing of the Eleventh Army and the Bulgarian First Army was put forward but was quickly dismissed by the Germans as impossible. In addition no real reinforcements from them were going to arrive on time. During this period of hesitation the danger to the right flank of the First Army grew and it was finally ordered to retreat. The defeated British took advantage of this and began pursuing. In the next several days the situation deteriorated and several thousand Bulgarian soldiers revolted and headed towards Sofia and on 27 September they proclaimed the overthrow of the monarchy. During this time the Bulgarian government was under pressure from all sides and finally decided to begin negotiations so on 29 September the Salonica Armistice was concluded. The First Army was demobilized on 15 October 1918.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bulgaria, under Tsar Boris III, aligned itself with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, and as a result regained Southern Dobruja in the Treaty of Craiova of September 1940, and occupied Western Thrace, and much of Macedonia after the Germans invaded Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941. In the Bulgarian Army, there were four or five field armies, including the First Army, and some 30 divisions. In the spring of 1942, Hitler requested Boris' help controlling occupied Serbia. The Tsar allowed the Germans to use his First Army, and so the First Army began its occupation duty in Yugoslavia, where the partisan movement was already active.\n\nIn early September 1944, the rapidly advancing Red Army reached the northern border of Bulgaria. The Bulgarians continued fighting the guerrillas in Thrace and Macedonia, but also turned their guns on the Germans. By the end of the month the First Army, together with the Bulgarian Second and Fourth Armies, was in full-scale combat against the German Army along the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border, with Yugoslav guerrillas on their left flank and a Soviet force on their right. At this time the First Army consisted of three 10,000-men divisions.\n\nBy December 1944, the First Army numbered 99,662 men. The First Army took part in the Bulgarian Army's advance northwards into the Balkan Peninsula with logistical support and under command of the Red Army. The First Army, along with the rest of the Bulgarian forces, advanced into Hungary and Austria in the spring of 1945, despite heavy casualties and bad conditions in the winter. Because of the army's equipment shortages, on March 14, 1945, the Soviets agreed to provide the Bulgarians 344 aircraft, 65 T-34 tanks, 410 guns, 115 anti-aircraft guns, 370 mortars, 370 transport vehicles, and some 30,000 small arms, all free of charge.\n\nDuring 1944–45, the Bulgarian First Army was commanded by Lieutenant-General Vladimir Stoychev. On 8 May 1945, Gen. Stoychev signed a demarcation agreement with British V Corps commander Charles Keightley in Klagenfurt, southern Austria.\n\n\n"}

He headed the United States Coast Survey and the Bureau of Weights and Measures.\n\nHassler was born in Aarau, Switzerland. He was employed on the trigonometrical survey of Switzerland before he emigrated to the United States in 1805. He was acting professor of mathematics at West Point from 1807 to 1810. He was employed by the federal government of the United States by 1811 in an effort to begin a Coast Survey. An Act of Congress on February 10, 1807 had appropriated $50,000 to pay for the beginning of the work. Afterward, he became the first superintendent of the United States Coast Survey in 1816. Two years later, the United States Congress passed the control of the Coast Survey to the army, principally, where it lingered until 1832.\n\nHassler became the head of the Bureau of Weights and Measures in the Treasury Department where he carried out the early work of establishing the standards of weights and measures in the United States, with the involvement of fellow Swiss immigrant Albert Gallatin, who in 1827 brought from Europe a troy pound of brass which was made the standard of mass in 1828. Besides several textbooks of science, Hassler produced a publication in 1828 titled \"System of the Universe\" in two volumes.\n\nHassler undertook a complete investigation of the national standards in 1830. Perhaps the most meaningful national standard to be adopted in 1830 was the gallon at 231 cubic inches. In the United States, however, each State retained the rights to employ its own set of standards of weights and measures. Since 1830, a great deal of national legislation has been enacted, with much of it addressing the acceptance or the rejection of the metric system. The United States Bureau of Standards was created by an Act of Congress on March 3, 1901. As mentioned above, the Coast Survey languished for 14 years from 1818 to 1832. In 1823, 1824, and 1825, the Navy Department tried to establish a hydrographic office. Also, the Survey was a source of discussions in Congress, which finally passed a law on July 10, 1832 that resulted in the removal of the Survey away from the army and the navy. Hassler was appointed the superintendent of the Survey on August 9, 1832, and he served in that post until his death on November 20, 1843. The steamship owned by the Coast Survey was named the \"Hassler\".\n\n\"The unit of length to which all distances measured in the Coast Survey are referred is the French metre, an authentic copy of which is preserved in the archives of the Coast Survey Office. It is the property of the American Philosophical Society, to whom it was presented by Mr. Hassler, who had received it from Tralles, a member of the French Committee charged with the construction of the standard metre by comparison with the toise, which had served as unit of length in the measurement of the meridional arcs in France and Peru. It possesses all the authenticity of any original metre extant, bearing not only the stamp of the Committee, but also the original mark by which it was distiguished from the other bars during the operation of standarding. It is always designated as the Committee metre\" (French : \"Mètre des Archives\").\nFerdinand Rudolph Hassler's granddaughter, Mary Caroline Hassler Newcomb, married the much noted astronomer and mathematician Simon Newcomb. Simon and Mary Caroline Hassler Newcomb were themselves the grandparents of the also much noted professor of mathematics, Hassler Whitney.\n\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration survey ship NOAAS \"Ferdinand R. Hassler\" (S 250) is named for Hassler.\n\n\n\n"}

It allows code in a web browser to use Java functions running on a web server as if those functions were within the browser. The DWR project was started by Joe Walker in 2004, 1.0 released at 29 Aug 2005.\n\n\nDWR takes a novel approach to Ajax by dynamically generating JavaScript code based on Java classes. Thus the web developer can use Java code from JavaScript as if it were local to the web browser; whereas in reality the Java code runs in the web server and has full access to web server resources. For security reasons the web developer must configure exactly which Java classes are safe to export (which is often called \"web.xml\" or \"dwr.xml\").\n\nThis method of remoting functions from Java to JavaScript gives DWR users a feel much like conventional RPC mechanisms like RMI or SOAP, with the benefit that it runs over the web without requiring web browser plug-ins.\n\nDWR does not consider the web browser / web server protocol to be important, and prefers to ensure that the programmer's interface is natural. The greatest challenge to this is to marry the asynchronous nature of Ajax with the synchronous nature of normal Java method calls.\n\nIn the asynchronous model, result data is only available some time after the initial call is made. DWR solves this problem by allowing the web developer to specify a function to be called when the data is returned using an extra method parameter. This extra method is called CallBack Method. The value returned from the java function will be passed to the callback method.\n\nHere is a sample Callback:\n\nThe callback is that function inside the Json object passed as an additional parameter to the remoted function.\n\nWith version 2.0, DWR supports Comet (also called \"Reverse Ajax) where Java code running on the server can deliberately send dedicated JavaScript to a browser.\n\n"}

Hydropolis should be the first multi-room underwater hotel in the world. It was planned in the Persian Gulf off Dubai through the mediation of the Austrian Citizen, DKfm. Hans Peter Pesenhofer following plans of Siemens IBC (Prof. Roland Dieterle) in cooperation with the German Designer Joachim Hauser (Bitterfeld) and with the approval of the DDIA. The hotel's original plan was to be located 20 meters underwater off the coast of Jumeriah beach. The hotel's plan is to cover an area of 260 hectares, which is equivalent in area to Hyde Park in London.[1] The construction cost for Hydropolis is approximately € 600 million Euro, which will make Hydropolis one of the most expensive hotels ever created.[2] The hotel design was created by Joachim Hauser and Professor Roland Dieterle, and is planned to be composed of three segments: a land station, a connecting train, and the underwater hotel. Joachim Hauser's and Prof. Roland Dieterle's architecture idea is to represent the connection between humans and water. The initial planned opening year was 2006, but due to financial reasons and disagreements with the DDIA (Dubai Development & Investment Authority), the project was canceled by the DDIA already on October 2004. Hydropolis Holdings LLC Dubai was holding the original intellectual property rights of Hydropolis.The original plan was to locate it underwater off the coast of Jumeirah Beach. The hotel's plan is to cover an area of .\n\nThe design of the land station is a wave-shaped 30,000 square meter building. The purpose of the land station is to provide a place for guests to board the soundless train to descend into the hotel. Secondary purposes for the land station include greeting guests, and use of the land station's facilities. The land station is planned to feature many facilities, including a marine research laboratory, a plastic surgery clinic, conference facilities, a restaurant, and a theater. The theater is intended to feature films about the evolution of life and about the history of underwater architecture.\n\nThe noiseless train will be located in a , transparent, double-track tunnel, made of plexiglass reinforced with concrete and steel. This train will be powered by an automated cable propulsion system. This automated cable propulsion system consists of a stationary motor and cables with the train cars fixed to the cables. The stationary motor for the train system will be located in the land station, and will be connected to cables running down the length of the tunnel. The train cars, fixed to these cables, will be moved up and down the tunnel solely from the power of the land motor. This system is advantageous because separating the motor from the train cars will decrease noise in the tunnel. This decreases noise because the motor is the main source of noise in this train system. With the motor separate from the train cars, noise in the cars and tunnel will be minimized. Another advantage of this system is that a separate motor results in less mechanical parts in the car, which also mean less repairs on the actual train cars.\n\nRubber wheels were chosen over other types of wheel, such as steel, to minimize noise. Rubber wheels have a property of making little noise as they roll on surfaces such as plexiglass. The noiseless train will serve two purposes, transferring guests and supplying the underwater hotel. Supplies will be packed on land, and delivered efficiently to the hotel to minimize the space taken up by goods in the hotel. Cars transferring supplies will feature palettes, and cars transferring passengers will provide a view of the ocean. The guest transporting aspect of the train will have a maximum efficiency of 1000 people per hour.\n\nThe underwater hotel will be a jellyfish like structure. The underwater hotel will be located 20 meters underneath the surface of the ocean. To handle the underwater pressures, the hotel's main structure is a dome composed of plexiglass, reinforced with concrete and steel. The underwater hotel will be composed of 220 underwater suites with a cost of $5500 per night. In addition to the underwater suites, Hydropolis is planned to have many other underwater accommodations including restaurants, a spa, a cinema, a ballroom, and bars. The underwater hotel is planned to not only be a place for regular guests, but also a place for visitors to explore.\n\n"}
{"id": "1926209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926209", "title": "Bolting (horticulture)", "text": "Bolting (horticulture)\n\nBolting is the production of a flowering stem (or stems) on agricultural and horticultural crops before the crop is harvested, in a natural attempt to produce seeds and reproduce. These flowering stems are usually vigorous extensions of existing leaf-bearing stems, and in order to produce them, a plant diverts resources away from producing the edible parts such as leaves or roots, resulting in flavor and texture changes, withering, and in general, a poor quality harvest. Plants that have produced flowering stems in this way are said to have bolted. Crops inclined to bolt include lettuce, basil, beetroot, brassicas, spinach, celery, onion, and leek.\n\nBolting is induced by plant hormones of the gibberellin family, and can occur as a result of several factors, including changes in day length, the prevalence of high temperatures at particular stages in a plant's growth cycle, and the existence of stresses such as insufficient water or minerals. These factors may interact in a complex way. Day length may affect the propensity to bolt in that some plants are \"long day plants\", some are \"short day plants\" and some are \"day neutral\" (see photoperiodism), so for example when a long day plant, such as spinach, experiences increasingly long days that reach a particular length, it will be inclined to bolt. Low or high temperatures can affect the propensity of some plants to bolt if they are experienced for sufficient periods at particular points in the life cycle of the plant; once these conditions have been met, plants that require such a trigger will subsequently bolt regardless of subsequent temperatures. Plants under stress may respond by bolting so that they can produce seeds before they die.\n\nPlant breeders have introduced cultivars of \"bolt-proof\" crops that are less prone to the condition.\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2004 to 2007 as part of Team Canada.\n\nRalphs was born in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, and relocated to Dunnville, Ontario at the age of five. He later moved to Windsor, Ontario to attend the University of Windsor.\n\nAlastair Ralphs was trained by Scott D'Amore in the Can-Am Wrestling School, and debuted in D'Amore's Border City Wrestling promotion in 2001. After spending three years as an undercard talent, Ralphs became A-1, a cocky, arrogant heel, forming an alliance with Johnny Swinger. He defeated D'Lo Brown for the BCW Heavyweight Championship on December 12, 2004, in Belleville, Michigan at \"A Night of Appreciation for Sabu\".\n\nOn January 23, 2005, at New Year's Revolution, Ralphs interrupted the Hall of Fame induction ceremony, complaining that he was being overshadowed by older wrestlers. Scott D'Amore responded with a jibe aimed at Ralph's previous career as a bodybuilder, leading to a brawl between Ralphs and D'Amore. Following a distraction from Jade, A-1 was able to powerbomb D'Amore through a table. Ralphs went on to retain the heavyweight title in a match with Abyss, using Abyss's own chain to knock him unconscious.\n\nRalphs lost the BCW Heavyweight Championship to Bobby Roode on July 22, 2005. In the course of his reign as champion he faced well-known veterans such as Jim Neidhart and King Kong Bundy.\n\nOn the November 27 episode of WWE Velocity, A-1 and Robbie McAllister lost to Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak.

{"id": "1926237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926237", "title": "Placidia", "text": "Placidia\n\nPlacidia () was the wife of Olybrius, unrecognized Western Roman Emperor. Her full name is uncertain. The \"Chronicle of the Roman Emperors: The reign by reign record of the rulers of Imperial Rome\" (1995) by Chris Scarre gives her name as Galla Placidia Valentiniana or Galla Placidia the Younger, based on naming conventions for women in ancient Rome.\n\nPlacidia was the second daughter of Valentinian III and Licinia Eudoxia, younger sister of Eudocia, who became the wife of Huneric, son of Gaiseric, king of the Vandals. Both were named for their grandmothers: Eudocia for the maternal, Aelia Eudocia, and Placidia for the paternal, Galla Placidia. Placidia is estimated to have been born between 439 and 443.\n\nIn 454 or 455, Placidia married Anicius Olybrius, a member of the Anicii family, a prominent family with known members active in both Italia and Gaul. The exact relation of Olybrius to other members of the family is not known as his parents are not named in primary sources. Several theories exist as to their identity.\n\nOriginally Emperor Valentinian intended to marry Placidia to a young man named Majorian (the future emperor), whom Oost describes as having \"\"distinguished himself in a subaltern capacity fighting in Gaul against the Franks under Aëtius' own command.\"\" Doing so, according to Roman customs, would instantly link Majorian to the Imperial family and put him in line to succeed Valentinian. Once Flavius Aetius learned of this plan, he rusticated Majorian to his estates at some date before 451, and he was recalled to Rome only after Aetius' death. Aetius also attempted to consolidate his position \"by compelling the Emperor to swear to friendship with him and to agree to betroth Placidia to his own younger son Gaudentius.\"\n\nMommaerts and Kelley have proposed a theory that Petronius Maximus, the successor of Valentinian III on the Western Roman throne in 455, was behind the marriage of Placidia to Olybrius. They argue that Olybrius was likely a son of Petronius Maximus himself, reasoning that Petronius, once on the throne, would be unlikely to promote distant relatives as potential successors. According to Hydatius, Petronius arranged the marriage of his eldest stepdaughter Eudocia to Palladius, his eldest son and Caesar. They suggest that he followed suit in arranging the marriage of Placidia to one of his own younger sons, thus making the marriage of Placidia and Olybrius the third marriage between a member of the Theodosian dynasty and a member of the extended Anicii family within the same year.\n\nAccording to the chronicler Malchus, \"Around this time, the empress Eudoxia, the widow of the emperor Valentinian and the daughter of the emperor Theodosius and Eudocia, remained unhappily at Rome and, enraged at the tyrant Maximus because of the murder of her spouse, she summoned the Vandal Gaiseric, king of Africa, against Maximus, who was ruling Rome. He came suddenly to Rome with his forces and captured the city, and having destroyed Maximus and all his forces, he took everything from the palace, even the bronze statues. He even led away as captives surviving senators, accompanied by their wives; along with them he also carried off to Carthage in Africa the empress Eudoxia, who had summoned him; her daughter Placidia, the wife of the patrician Olybrius, who then was staying at Constantinople; and even the maiden Eudocia. After he had returned, Gaiseric gave the younger Eudocia, a maiden, the daughter of the empress Eudoxia, to his son Huneric in marriage, and he held them both, the mother and the daughter, in great honor\"(Chron. 366).\n\nEudoxia was presumably following the example of her sister-in-law Justa Grata Honoria who had summoned Attila the Hun for help against an unwanted marriage. According to the chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine, Maximus was in Rome when the Vandals arrived. He gave anyone who could permission to flee the city. He attempted to flee himself but was assassinated by the imperial slaves. He had reigned for seventy-seven days. His body was thrown into the Tiber and never recovered. Victor of Tonnena agrees, adding that Pope Leo I negotiated with Gaiseric for the security of the city's population.\n\nHydatius attributes the assassination to revolting troops of the Roman army, enraged at Maximus' attempted flight. The Chronica Gallica of 511 attributes the assassination to a rioting crowd. Jordanes identifies a single assassin as \"Ursus, a Roman soldier\". Sidonius Apollinaris makes a cryptic comment about a Burgundian whose \"traitorous leadership\" led the crowd to panic and to the slaughter of the Emperor. His identity is unknown, presumably a general who failed to face the Vandals for one reason or another. Later historians have suggested two high-ranking Burgundians as possible candidates, Gondioc and his brother Chilperic. Both joined Theodoric II in invading Hispania later in 455.\n\nOlybrius was in Constantinople at the time of the siege of Rome as noted by John Malalas. He was separated from his wife for the duration of her captivity. He reportedly visited Daniel the Stylite who predicted that Eudoxia and Placidia would return.\n\nPriscus and John of Antioch report that Gaiseric entertained the idea of placing Olybrius on the throne of the Western Roman Empire, at least as early as the death of Majorian in 461. Due to his marriage to Placidia, Olybrius could be considered both an heir to Theodosian dynasty and a member of the Vandal royal family through marriage. In 465, Libius Severus died and Gaiseric again promoted Olybrius as his candidate for the Western throne. Procopius report that Olybrius maintained a decent relationship with his Vandal supporter.\n\nAccording to the accounts of Priscus, Procopius, John Malalas, Theodorus Lector, Evagrius Scholasticus, Theophanes the Confessor, Joannes Zonaras and Cedrenus, Placidia can be estimated to have stayed a prisoner in Carthage for six to seven years. In 461 or 462, Leo I, Eastern Roman Emperor, paid a large ransom for Eudoxia and Placidia. Placidia seems to have spent the rest of her life in Constantinople.\n\nIn 472, the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius was involved in a civil war with his \"magister militum\" and son-in-law Ricimer. According to John Malalas, Leo decided to intervene and send Olybrius to quell the hostilities. Olybrius had also been instructed to offer a peace treaty to Geiseric on his behalf. However, Leo had also send Modestus, another messenger, to Anthemius asking him to arrange the deaths of both Ricimer and Olybrius. But Ricimer had placed Goths loyal to him at the ports of Rome and Ostia Antica and they intercepted Modestus, delivering him and his message to Ricimer himself. Ricimer revealed the contents of the message to Olybrius and the two men formed a new alliance against their former masters.\n\nIn April or May 472, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor and the civil war proper began. John of Antioch claims that Anthemius was supported by most of the Romans while Ricimer, by the barbarian mercenaries. Odoacer, leader of the \"foederati\", joined the cause of Ricimer, and also Gundobad, the nephew of Ricimer. According to John Malalas and John of Antioch, Gundobad managed to slay Anthemius and end the conflict. They claim that Anthemius had been abandoned by his last followers and sought refuge in a church, but Gundobad killed him anyway. But the two chroniclers differ on the location of the event. Malalas places it in the Old St. Peter's Basilica while the Antiochean places it in Santa Maria in Trastevere. However Cassiodorus, Marcellinus Comes and Procopius report that Anthemius was killed by Ricimer himself. The Chronica Gallica of 511 mentions both theories, uncertain of which of the two men had done the deed.\n\nWith Anthemius dead, Olybrius became the sole Western Roman Emperor by default. Placidia became his Empress without actually leaving Constantinople, remaining there with their daughter. On 18 August, 472, Ricimer died of a \"malignant fever\". Paul the Deacon reports that Olybrius next appointed Gundobad as his Patrician.\n\nOn 22 October or 2 November, 472, Olybrius himself died. John of Antioch attributes his death to dropsy. Cassiodorus and Magnus Felix Ennodius report the death without noting a cause. All report on how brief the reign was.\n\nIn 478, Malchus reported that \"ambassadors came to Byzantium from Carthage, under the leadership of Alexander, the guardian of Olybrius' wife [sc. Placidia]. He formerly had been sent there by Zeno with the agreement of Placidia herself. The ambassadors said that Huneric had honestly set himself up as a friend of the emperor, and so loved all things Roman that he renounced everything that he had formerly claimed from the public revenues and also the other moneys that Leo had earlier seized from his wife [sc. Eudocia]... He gave thanks that the emperor had honored the wife of Olybrius...\" Placidia is last mentioned c. 484.\n\nPlacidia was probably the last Western Roman Empress whose name is still known. Glycerius and Romulus Augustus are not known to have been married. Julius Nepos had married a niece of Verina and Leo I, whose name is not mentioned in surviving records.\n\nHer only known daughter was Anicia Juliana, born c. 462, who spent her life at the pre-Justinian court of Constantinople. Juliana was considered \"both the most aristocratic and the wealthiest inhabitant\". Oost comments that \"through her the descendants of Galla Placidia [Placidia's grandmother] were among the nobility of the Eastern Empire.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1926240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926240", "title": "Teletext", "text": "Teletext\n\nTeletext, or broadcast teletext, is a videotex standard for displaying text and rudimentary graphics on suitably equipped television sets. Teletext sends data in the broadcast signal, hidden in the invisible vertical blank interrupt area at the top and bottom of the screen. The teletext decoder in the television buffers this information as a series of \"pages\", each given a number. The user can display chosen pages using their remote control.\n\nIt was created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by John Adams, Philips' Lead Designer for video display units. Public teletext information services were introduced by major broadcasters in the UK, starting with the BBC's Ceefax service in 1974. It offered a range of text-based information, typically including news, weather and TV schedules. Also, paged subtitle (or closed captioning) information was transmitted using the same system. Similar systems were subsequently introduced by other television broadcasters in the UK and mainland Europe in the following years. Meanwhile the UK's General Post Office introduced the Prestel system using the same display standards but run over telephone lines using bi-directional modems rather than the send-only system used with televisions.\n\nTeletext formed the basis for World System Teletext, an extended version of the same basic system. This saw widespread use across Europe starting in the 1980s, with almost all televisions including a decoder. The teletext system was also used for a number of experimental systems, notably in the United States, but these were never as popular as their European counterparts and most closed by the early 1990s. Most European teletext systems continued to exist in one form or another until well into the first decade of the 2000s, when the expansion of internet precipitated a closure of some of them. However many European television stations continue to provide teletext services and even make teletext content available via web and dedicated apps.\n\nTeletext is broadcast in numbered \"pages.\" For example, a list of news headlines might appear on page 110; a teletext user would type \"110\" into the TV's remote control to view this page.\n\nThe broadcaster constantly sends out pages in sequence. There will typically be a delay of a few seconds from requesting the page and it being broadcast and displayed, the time being entirely dependent in the number of pages being broadcast.\nMore sophisticated receivers use a memory buffer to store some or all of the teletext pages as they are broadcast, allowing instant display from the buffer.\n\nThis basic architecture separates from other digital information systems, such as the internet, whereby pages are 'requested' and then 'sent' to the user – a method not possible given the one-way nature of broadcast teletext.\nUnlike the Internet, teletext is broadcast, so it does not slow down further as the number of users increase, although the greater number of pages, the longer one is likely to wait for each to be found in the cycle. For this reason, some pages (e.g. common index pages) are broadcast more than once in each cycle.\n\nTeletext proved to be a reliable text news service during events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks, during which the webpages of major news sites became inaccessible because of the high demand. Teletext is also used for carrying special packets interpreted by TVs and video recorders, containing information about subjects such as channels and programming.\n\nAlthough the term \"teletext\" tends to be used to refer to the PAL-based system, or variants, the recent availability of digital television has led to more advanced systems being provided that perform the same task, such as MHEG-5 in the UK, and Multimedia Home Platform.\n\nTeletext is a means of sending text and simple geometric shapes to a properly equipped television screen by use of one of the \"vertical blanking interval\" lines that together form the dark band dividing pictures horizontally on the television screen. \nTransmitting and displaying subtitles was relatively easy. It requires limited bandwidth; at a rate of perhaps a few words per second. However, it was found that by combining even a slow data rate with a suitable memory, whole pages of information could be sent and stored in the TV for later recall.\n\nIn the early 1970s work was in progress in Britain to develop such a system. The goal was to provide UK rural homes with electronic hardware that could download pages of up-to-date news, reports, facts and figures targeting U.K. agriculture. The original idea was the brainchild of Philips (CAL) Laboratories in 1970.\n\nIn 1971, CAL engineer John Adams created a design and proposal for UK broadcasters. His configuration contained all the fundamental elements of classic Teletext including pages of 24 rows with 40 characters each, page selection, sub pages of information and vertical blanking interval data transmission.\n\nA major objective for Adams during the concept development stage was to make Teletext affordable to the home user. \nIn reality, there was no scope to make an economic Teletext system with 1971 technology. However, as low cost was essential to the project's long term success, this obstacle had to be overcome.\n\nMeanwhile, the General Post Office (GPO), whose telecommunications division later became British Telecom, had been researching a similar concept since the late 1960s, known as Viewdata. Unlike Teledata which was a one-way service carried in the existing TV signal, Viewdata was a two-way system using telephones. Since the Post Office owned the telephones, this was considered to be an excellent way to drive more customers to use the phones.\n\nIn 1972 the BBC demonstrated their system, now known as Ceefax (\"see facts\", the departmental stationery used the \"Cx\" logo), on various news shows. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) announced their own service in 1973, known as ORACLE (Optional Reception of Announcements by Coded Line Electronics). Not to be outdone, the GPO immediately announced a 1200/75 baud videotext service under the name Prestel.\n\nThe first teletext test transmissions were made by Ceefax in 1973. After proliferation of the BBC system in the UK, it was adopted in Europe and standardised as World System Teletext (WST). The World Wide Web began to take over some of the functions of teletext from the late 1990s and many broadcasters have ceased broadcast of teletext—CNN in 2006 and the BBC in 2012. In the UK the decline of teletext has been hastened by the introduction of digital television, though an aspect of teletext continues in closed captioning. In other countries the system is still widely used on standard-definition DVB broadcasts.\n\nA number of teletext services have been syndicated to web viewers, which mimic the look and feel of broadcast teletext. RSS feeds of news and information from the BBC are presented in Ceefax format in the web viewer.\n\nIn 2016, the Teefax teletext service was launched in the United Kingdom to coverage by the BBC, ITV and others. Using a Raspberry Pi computer card as a set-top box, it feeds its service to standard televisions. Teefax content is a mix of crowdsourcing, syndication and contributions from media professionals who contributed heavily to broadcast teletext services. Teefax is also syndicated to a web viewer.\n\nThe systems were originally incompatible; Ceefax displayed pages of 24 lines with 32 characters each, while ORACLE offered pages of 22 lines with 40 characters each. In other ways the standards overlapped; for instance, both used 7-bit ASCII characters and other basic details. In 1974 all the services agreed a standard for displaying the information. The display would be a simple grid of text, with some \"graphics characters\" for constructing simple graphics. The standard did not define the delivery system, so both Viewdata-like and Teledata-like services could at least share the TV-side hardware (which at that point in time was quite expensive).\n\nFollowing test transmissions in 1973–74, towards the end of 1974 the BBC news department put together an editorial team of nine, including and led by Editor Colin McIntyre, to develop a news and information service. Initially limited to 30 pages, the Ceefax service was later expanded to 100 pages and was launched formally in 1976. It was followed quickly by ORACLE and Prestel. Wireless World magazine ran a series of articles between November 1975 and June 1976 describing the design and construction of a teletext decoder using mainly TTL devices; however, development was limited until the first TV sets with built-in decoders started appearing in 1977.\n\nBy 1982 there were two million such sets, and by the mid-1980s they were available as an option for almost every European TV set, typically by means of a plug in circuit board. It took another decade before the decoders became a standard feature on almost all sets with a screen size above 15 inches (teletext is still usually only an option for smaller \"portable\" sets). From the mid-1980s both Ceefax and ORACLE were broadcasting several hundred pages on every channel, slowly changing them throughout the day.\n\nThe \"Broadcast Teletext Specification\" was published in September 1976 jointly by the IBA, the BBC and the British Radio Equipment Manufacturers' Association. The new standard also made the term \"teletext\" generic, describing any such system. The standard was internationalised as World System Teletext (WST), formalised as an international standard by CCIR in 1986 as CCIR Teletext System B.\n\nIn the early 1980s a number of higher extension levels were envisaged for the specification, based on ideas then being promoted for worldwide videotex standards (telephone dial-up services offering a similar mix of text and graphics).\n\nThe most common implementation is Level 1.5, that supports languages other than English. Virtually any TV sold in Europe since the 1990s has support for this level.\nAround the year 2000 some station adopted Level 2.5 teletext / Hi-Text, that allowed for a larger color palette and higher resolution graphics.\n\nThe proposed higher content levels included geometrically-specified graphics (Level 4), and higher-resolution photographic-type images (Level 5), to be conveyed using the same underlying mechanism at the transport layer. No TV sets currently implement the two most sophisticated levels.\n\nThe Mullard SAA5050 was a character generator chip used in the UK teletext-equipped television sets. \nIn addition to the UK version, several variants of the chip existed with slightly different character sets for particular localizations and/or languages. These had part numbers SAA5051 (German), SAA5052 (Swedish), SAA5053 (Italian), SAA5054 (Belgian), SAA5055 (U.S. ASCII), SAA5056 (Hebrew) and SAA5057 (Cyrillic).\n\nThe type of decoder circuitry is sometimes marked on televisions as CCT (Computer-Controlled Teletext), or ECCT (Enhanced Computer-Controlled Teletext).\n\nBesides the hardware implementations, it's also possible to decode teletext using a PC and video capture or DVB board.\n\nAdoption in the United States was hampered due to a lack of a single teletext standard and consumer resistance to the high initial price of teletext decoders. Throughout the period of analog broadcasting, teletext or other similar technologies in the US were practically non-existent, with the only technologies resembling such existing in the country being closed captioning, TV Guide On Screen, and Extended Data Services (XDS).\n\nNABTS was originally developed as a protocol by the Canadian Department of Communications, with their industry partner Norpak, for the Telidon system. It was similar to the European World System Teletext (WST, aka CCIR Teletext System B), but differences between the European and North American television standards and the greater flexibility of the Telidon standard led to the creation of a new delivery mechanism that was tuned for speed.\n\nFirst demonstrated in the United States in 1978, NABTS was the standard used for both CBS's ExtraVision and NBC's very short-lived NBC Teletext services in the mid-1980s.\n\nStation KSL-TV in Salt Lake City, Utah premiered a teletext service using Ceefax. They were followed by television network CBS, which carried out preliminary tests on both the British Teletext and the rival French Antiope system.\n\nOne of the most prominent providers was the \"Electra\" teletext service, using World System Teletext (WST), broadcast from the early 1980s on American cable channel WTBS.\nElectra also carried another teletext service on its higher-numbered pages, a service called \"Tempo\". \"Tempo\" mainly carried sports (and other miscellaneous) information on its pages.\nAt the time of Electra's closing in 1993, it was the only existing teletext service in the USA.\n\nA few other services were offered by some large-market TV stations in the US throughout the 1980s, such as Metrotext from KTTV in Los Angeles and KeyFax from WFLD in Chicago.\nDespite this, the system never caught on in the USA partly due to EIA-608 being deployed for captioning before Teletext was introduced and the higher cost of Teletext receivers.\n\nIn the 1980s a similar system called Telidon was developed in Canada by the Department of Communications. It used a simple graphics language that would allow a more complex circuit in the TV to decode not only characters, but graphics as well. To do this, the graphic was encoded as a series of instructions (graphics primitives) like \"polyline\" which was represented as the characters PL followed by a string of digits for the X and Y values of the points on the line. This system was referred to as PDI (Picture Description Instructions). Later improved versions of Telidon were developed into NAPLPS.\n\nAlthough there were numerous attempts to introduce NAPLPS services in North America, none of these was successful and eventually shut down. A number of special-purpose systems lived on for some time, similar to Prestel's lingering death, but the widespread rollout of internet access in the 1990s ended these efforts.\n\nBesides the US and UK developments, a number of similar teletext services were developed in other countries, some of which attempted to address the limitations of the initial British-developed system.\n\nIn France, where the SECAM standard is used in television broadcasting, a teletext system was developed in the late 1970s under the name \"Antiope\". It had a higher data rate and was capable of dynamic page sizes, allowing more sophisticated graphics. It was phased out in favour of standard teletext in 1991.\n\nThe Acorn BBC Micro's default graphics mode (mode 7) was based on Teletext display, and the computer could be used to create and serve Teletext-style pages over a modem connection. With a suitable adapter, the computer could receive and display teletext pages, as well as software over the BBC's Ceefax service, for a time. The Philips P2000 home computer's video logic was also based on a chip designed to provide teletext services in TVs.\n\nPrestel was a British information-retrieval system based on teletext protocols. However, it was essentially a different system, using a modem and the phone system to transmit and receive the data, comparable to systems such as France's Minitel. The modem was asymmetric, with data sent at 75-bit/s, and received at 1200-bit/s. This two-way nature allowed pages to be served on request, in contrast to the TV-based systems' sequential rolling method. It also meant that a limited number of extra services were available such as booking event or train tickets and a limited amount of online banking.\n\nTeletext information is broadcast in the vertical blanking interval between image frames in a broadcast television signal, in numbered \"pages.\"\n\nTeletext allows up to eight 'magazines' to be broadcast, identified by the first digit of the three-digit page number (1–8). Within each magazine there may theoretically be up to 256 pages at a given time, numbered in hexadecimal and prefixed with the magazine number – for example magazine 2 may contain pages numbered 200-2FF. In practice, however, non-decimal page numbers are rarely used as domestic teletext receivers will not have options to select hex values A-F, with such numbered pages only occasionally used for 'special' pages of interest to the broadcaster and not intended for public view.\n\nThe broadcaster constantly sends out pages in sequence in one of two modes: Serial mode broadcasts every page sequentially whilst parallel mode divides VBI lines amongst the magazines, enabling one page from each magazine to be broadcast simultaneously. There will typically be a delay of a few seconds from requesting the page and it being broadcast and displayed, the time being entirely dependent in the number of pages being broadcast in the magazine (parallel mode) or in total (serial mode) and the number of VBI lines allocated. In parallel mode, therefore, some magazines will load faster than others.\n\nMore sophisticated systems use a memory buffer to store some or all of the teletext pages as they are broadcast, allowing instant display from the buffer.\n\nThe greater number of pages, the longer one is likely to wait for each to be found in the cycle. For this reason, some pages (e.g. common index pages) are broadcast more than once in each cycle.\n\nA standard PAL signal contains 625 lines of video data per screen, broken into two \"fields\" containing half the lines of the whole image, divided as every odd line, then every even line number. Lines near the top of the screen are used to synchronize the display to the signal, and are not seen on-screen. CEPT1 hides the data in these lines, where they are not visible, using lines 6–22 on the first field and 318–335 on the second field. The system does not have to use all of these lines; a unique pattern of bits allows the decoder to identify which lines contain data. Some teletext services use a great number of lines, others, for reasons of bandwidth and technical issues, use fewer.\n\nTeletext in the PAL B system can use the VBI lines 6–22 in first half image and 318–334 in the other to transmit 360 data bits including clock run-in and framing code during the active video period at a rate of using binary NRZ line coding. The amplitude for a \"0\" is black level ±2% and a \"1\" is 66±6% of the difference between black and peak white level. The clock run in consist of of \"10\" and the framing code is \"11100100\". The two last bits of the clock-run in shall start within from the negative flank of the line synchronization pulse.\n\nThe rate is , i.e. the TV line frequency. Thus 625 * 25 * 444 = 6 937 500 Hz. Each bit will then be 144 ns long. The bandwidth amplitude is 50% at 3.5 MHz and 0% at 6 MHz.\nIf the horizontal sync pulse during the vertical synchronization starts in the middle of horizontal scan line. Then first interlace frame will be sent, otherwise if vertical synchronization let the full video line complete the second interlace frame is sent.\n\nLike EIA-608 bits are transmitted in the order of LSB to MSB with odd parity coding of 7-bit character codes. However unlike EIA-608, the DVB version is transmitted the same way. For single bit error recovery during transmission, the packet address (page row and magazine numbers) and header bytes (page number, subtitle flag, etc.) use hamming code 8/4 with extended packets (header extensions) using hamming 24/18, which basically doubles the bits used.\n\nThe commonly used standard B uses a fixed PAL subtitling bandwidth of 8600 (7680 without page/packet header) bits/s per field for a maximum of 32 characters per line per caption (maximum 3 captions – lines 19 – 21) for a 25 frame broadcast. While the bandwidth is greater than EIA-608, so is the error rate with more bits encoded per field. Subtitling packets use a lot of non-boxed spacing to control the horizontal positioning of a caption and to pad out the fixed packet. The vertical caption position is determined by the packet address.\n\nIn the case of the Ceefax and ORACLE systems and their successors in the UK, the teletext signal is transmitted as part of the ordinary analog TV signal but concealed from view in the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) television lines which do not carry picture information. The teletext signal is digitally coded as 45-byte packets, so the resulting rate is 7,175 bits per second per used lines (41 7-bit 'bytes' per line, on each of 25 frames per second).\n\nA teletext page comprises one or more \"frames\", each containing a screen-full of text. The pages are sent out one after the other in a continual loop. When the user requests a particular page the decoder simply waits for it to be sent, and then captures it for display. In order to keep the delays reasonably short, services typically only transmit a few hundred frames in total. Even with this limited number, waits can be up to 30 seconds, although teletext broadcasters can control the speed and priority with which various pages are broadcast.\n\nModern television sets, however, usually have a built-in memory, often for a few thousand different pages. This way, the teletext decoder captures every page sent out and stores it in memory, so when a page is requested by the user it can be loaded directly from memory instead of having to wait for the page to be transmitted. When the page is transmitted again, the decoder updates the page in memory.\n\nThe text can be displayed instead of the television image, or superimposed on it (a mode commonly called \"mix\"). Some pages, such as subtitles (closed captioning), are \"in-vision\", meaning that text is displayed in a block on the screen covering part of the television image.\n\nThe original standard provides a mono spaced 40×24 character grid. Characters are sent using a 7-bit codec, with an 8th bit employed for error detection. The standard was improved in 1976 to allow for improved appearance and the ability to individually select the color of each character from a palette of 8. The proposed higher resolution Level 2 (1981) was not adopted in Britain (in-vision services from Ceefax & ORACLE did use it at various times however, though even this was ceased by the BBC in 1996), although transmission rates were doubled from two to four lines a frame.\n\nWhile the basic teletext format has remained unchanged in more than 30 years, a number of improvements and additions have been made.\n\nA closely related service is the Video Program System (VPS), introduced in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the vertical blanking interval. It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily the date and time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. Video recorders can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR. VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters can use it to mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.\nVPS (line 16) definition is now included in the PDC standard from ETSI.\n\nSome TV channels offer a service called interactive teletext to remedy some of the shortcomings of standard teletext. To use interactive teletext, the user calls a special telephone number with a push-button telephone. A computer then instructs them to go to a teletext page which is assigned to them for that session.\n\nUsually the page initially contains a menu of options, from which the user chooses using the telephone keypad. When a choice has been made, the selected page is immediately broadcast for viewing. This is in contrast with usual teletext where the user has to wait for the selected page to be broadcast.\n\nThis technology enables teletext to be used for games, chat, access to databases etc. It overcomes the limitations on the number of available pages. On the other hand, only a limited number of users can be serviced at the same time, since one page number is allocated per user. Some channels solve this by taking into account where the user is calling from and by broadcasting different teletext pages in different geographical regions. In that way, two different users can be assigned the same page number at the same time as long as they do not receive the TV signals from the same source. Another drawback to the technology is the privacy concerns in that many users can see what a user is doing because the interactive pages are received by all viewers. Also, the user usually has to pay for the telephone call to the TV station. \n\nThese services have since been superseded by the World Wide Web.\n\nWith the advent of digital television some countries adopted the name \"digital teletext\" for newer standards, despite the older teletext standards' digital nature. \"Digital teletext\" is encoded with standards including MHEG-5 and Multimedia Home Platform (MHP).\n\nOther countries use the same teletext streams as before on DVB transmissions, due to the DVB-TXT and DVB-VBI sub-standards. Those allow the emulation of analog teletext on digital TV platforms, directly on the TV or set-top box, or by recreating analog output, reproducing the vertical blanking interval data in which Teletext is carried.\n\nA number of broadcast authorities have recently ceased the transmission of teletext services.\n\n\n\"(Subtitling still continues to use Teletext in these three countries with some providers switching to using image based DVB subtitling for HD broadcasts. New Zealand solely uses DVB subtitling on terrestrial transmissions despite Teletext still being used on internal SDI links.)\"\n\n\n"}

William was the only son of Marquis Renier I and his wife Gisela, a daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy and widow of Count Humbert II of Savoy. It seems likely, given that he was still fit enough to participate in battle in 1187, that William was one of his parents' youngest children.\n\nHe was described by Acerbo Morena as of medium height and compact build, with a round, somewhat ruddy face and hair so fair as to be almost white. He was eloquent, intelligent and good-humoured, generous but not extravagant. Dynastically, he was extremely well-connected: a nephew of Pope Callixtus II, a half-brother of Amadeus III of Savoy, a brother-in-law of Louis VI of France (through his half-sister Adelasia of Moriana), and cousin of Alfonso VII of Castile.\n\nWilliam married Judith or Ita von Babenberg, daughter of Leopold III of Austria and Agnes of Germany, sometime before March 28, 1133. Judith was probably about 15 at the time. None of their surviving children seem to have been born before 1140 (there may have been older ones who died in infancy), and the youngest son was born in 1162. She died after 1168. They had five sons, four of whom became prominent in the affairs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and of Byzantium:\nand three daughters:\n\nThe \"vida\" of the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras claims that there was another daughter, Beatrice, who m. Henry I del Carretto, Marquis of Savona, and that she is the \"Bel Cavalher\" (\"Fair Knight\") of Vaqueiras's songs. However, the lyrics of Vaqueiras's songs (as opposed to the later \"vida\") describe Beatrice as Boniface's daughter, and thus William's granddaughter.\n\nOtto (Oddone of Montferrat, d. 1251), who became Bishop of Porto, and Cardinal in 1227, has sometimes been identified as a son of William V, and confused with Frederick. However, his dates make it more likely that he was a son of William VI of Montferrat, whether legitimate or not is uncertain.\n\nWilliam and Judith's powerful dynastic connections created difficulties in finding suitable wives for his sons, and too many potential spouses were related within prohibited degrees. In 1167, he unsuccessfully tried to negotiate marriages for his eldest sons to daughters of Henry II, King of England - but the girls were very young at the time and were related through Judith's descent from William V of Aquitaine. He then applied for sisters of William I, King of Scotland, who were not related, but were already married.\n\nWilliam took part in the Second Crusade, alongside his half-brother Amadeus of Savoy (who died during the campaign), his nephew Louis VII of France, his brother-in-law Count Guido of Biandrate, and his wife's German and Austrian relatives.\n\nAs supporters of the imperial party (later known as the Ghibellines), he and his sons fought with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (Judith's nephew) in his lengthy struggle against the Lombard League. Following Barbarossa's capitulation with the Peace of Venice in 1177, William was left to deal with the rebellious towns in the area alone. Meanwhile, the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos sought support for his own politics in Italy.\n\nWilliam broke with Barbarossa and formed an alliance with Manuel. His eldest surviving son, Conrad, was taken prisoner by Barbarossa's Chancellor, Archbishop Christian of Mainz, but then captured the chancellor in battle at Camerino. In 1179 Manuel suggested a marriage between his daughter Maria, second in line to the throne, and one of William's sons. As Conrad and Boniface were already married, the youngest son, Renier, was married off to the princess, who was ten years his senior. Renier and Maria were later killed during the usurpation of Andronikos, and the family rebuilt ties with Barbarossa.\n\nIn 1183, with the accession of his grandson Baldwin V, a minor, as co-King of Jerusalem, William, then probably in his late sixties, left the government of Montferrat to Conrad and Boniface, and returned to the east. He was granted the castle of St. Elias (present-day Taybeh). He fought in the Battle of Hattin in 1187, where he was captured by Saladin's forces. In the meantime, his second son, Conrad, had arrived at Tyre from Constantinople. Conrad was given the command of the defences. During the siege of Tyre in November that year, he is said to have refused to surrender as much as a stone of its walls to liberate his father, even threatening to shoot him with a crossbow himself when Saladin had him presented as a hostage. Eventually, Saladin withdrew his army from Tyre. In 1188, William was released unharmed at Tortosa, and seems to have ended his days in Tyre, with his son. He probably died in the summer of 1191: Conrad last describes himself as \"\"marchionis Montisferrati filius\"\" in a charter of May that year.\n\nWilliam de Montferrat is an assassination target in the video game \"Assassin's Creed\" (2007). In the game, de Montferrat is Liege Lord of Acre under King Richard and is portrayed as middle aged, rather than in his early eighties.\n\n"}

{"id": "1926268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1926268", "title": "John Lukacs", "text": "John Lukacs\n\nJohn Adalbert Lukacs (; Hungarian: \"Lukács János Albert\"; 31 January 1924 – 6 May 2019) was a Hungarian-born American historian who wrote more than thirty books, including \"Five Days in London, May 1940\" and \"A New Republic\". He was a professor of history at Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia from 1947 to 1994 and chaired that department from 1947 to 1974. He served as a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, Princeton University, La Salle University, Regent College in British Columbia and the University of Budapest and Hanover College. Lukacs was Roman Catholic. Lukacs described himself as a reactionary.\n\nLukacs was born in Budapest, Hungary, the son of Magdaléna Glück and Pál Lukács (born Löwinger), a physician. His parents, Jewish converts to Roman Catholicism, were divorced before World War II. Lukacs attended a classical gymnasium, had an English language tutor, and spent two summers at a private school in England. He studied history at the University of Budapest.\n\nDuring the Second World War, when German troops occupied Hungary in 1944, Lukacs was forced to serve in a Hungarian labour battalion for Jews. By the end of 1944, he had deserted from the battalion and was hiding in a cellar until the end of the war, evading deportation to death camps and surviving the siege of Budapest. According to his son, Lukacs never saw his parents again.\n\nAfter the war, Lukacs worked as the Secretary of the Hungarian-American Society. In 1946, he received his doctorate in Budapest.\n\nOn 22 July 1946, as it was becoming clear that Hungary would become a Communist state, he fled to the United States. He found employment as a part-time assistant lecturer at Columbia University in New York City. He then relocated to Philadelphia, where he worked as history professor at Chestnut Hill College (a women's college until 2003). He was a Visiting Professor at Princeton and Columbia Universities.\n\nHe was a president of the American Catholic Historical Association and member of the Royal Historical Society.\n\nBeing a proponent of a liberal democracy and an anti-Communist, Lukacs nevertheless wrote in the early 1950s several articles in \"Commonweal\" criticizing the approach taken by Senator Joseph McCarthy, whom he described as a vulgar demagogue.\n\nLukacs saw populism as the primary threat to modern civilization. By his own description, he considered himself a reactionary. He identified populism as the essence of both National Socialism and Communism, denying the existence of generic fascism and asserted that the differences between the political regimes of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were greater than their similarities.\n\nA major theme in Lukacs's writing is his agreement with the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville that aristocratic elites have been replaced by democratic elites, which obtain power via an appeal to the masses. In his 2002 book, \"At the End of an Age\", Lukacs argued that the modern/bourgeois age, which began around the time of the Renaissance, is coming to an end. The rise of populism and the decline of elitism is the theme of his experimental work, \"A Thread of Years\" (1998), a series of vignettes set in each year of the 20th century from 1900 to 1998, tracing the abandonment of gentlemanly conduct and the rise of vulgarity in American culture. Lukacs defends traditional Western civilization against what he sees as the leveling and debasing effects of mass culture.\n\nAn Anglophile, Lukacs gives the highest historical importance to Winston Churchill. He considered Churchill to be the greatest statesman of the 20th century, the savior not only of Great Britain but also of Western civilization itself. A recurring theme in his writing is the duel between Churchill and Adolf Hitler for mastery of the world. Their moral struggle, which Lukacs sees as a conflict between the archetypical reactionary and the archetypical revolutionary, is the major theme of \"The Last European War\" (1976), \"The Duel\" (1991), \"Five Days in London\" (1999) and 2008's \"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat\", a book which features Churchill's first major speech as Prime Minister. Lukacs argues that Great Britain (and by extension the British Empire) could not defeat Germany by itself and that winning required the entry of the United States and the Soviet Union. He points out that by inspiring the British people to resist German air attacks and to \"never surrender\" during the Battle of Britain in 1940, Churchill laid the groundwork for the subsequent victory of the Allies.\n\nLukacs had strong isolationist beliefs and unusually for an anti-Communist émigré also had \"surprisingly critical views of the Cold War from a unique conservative perspective\". Lukacs claimed that the Soviet Union was a feeble power on the verge of collapse and contended that the Cold War was an unnecessary waste of American treasure and life. Likewise, Lukacs was critical of American intervention abroad and also condemned the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn his book \"George F. Kennan and the Origins of Containment, 1944-1946\" (1997), a collection of letters exchanged between Lukacs and his close friend George F. Kennan during 1994–1995, Lukacs and Kennan criticized the claim of the New Left that the Cold War was caused by the United States. However, Lukacs argued that while Joseph Stalin was largely responsible for the beginning of the Cold War, the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower missed a chance for ending the Cold War in 1953 after Stalin's death, which kept it on for many more decades.\n\nFrom around 1977 onwards, Lukacs became one of the leading critics of the British author David Irving, whom Lukacs accused of engaging in unscholarly practices and having neo-Nazi sympathies. In a review of Irving's \"Hitler's War\" in 1977, Lukacs commented that as a \"right-wing revisionist\" who had admired some of Irving's early works, he initially had high hopes for \"Hitler's War\", but he found the book to be \"appalling\". Lukacs commented that Irving had uncritically used personal remembrances by those who knew Hitler to present him in the most favorable light possible. In his review, Lukacs argued that although World War II ended with Eastern Europe being left under Soviet domination, a victory that left only half of Europe to Stalin was much better than a defeat that left all of Europe to Hitler.\n\nLukacs’s book \"The Hitler of History\" (1997), a prosopography of the historians who have written biographies of Hitler, is in part a critique of Irving’s work. Lukacs considered Irving to be sympathetic to the Nazis. In turn, Irving has engaged in what many consider to be antisemitic and racist attacks against Lukacs. Because Lukacs' mother was Jewish, Irving disparagingly refers to him as \"a Jewish historian\". In letters of 25 October and 28 October 1997, Irving threatened to sue Lukacs for libel if he published his book (\"The Hitler of History\") without removing certain passages which were highly critical of Irving's work. The American edition of \"The Hitler of History\" was published in 1997 with the passages included, but because of Irving's legal threats no British edition of \"The Hitler of History\" was published until 2001. As a result of Irving's threat of legal action under British libel laws, when the British edition was finally published the passages containing the criticism of Irving's historical methods were expunged by the publisher.\n\nIn \"The Hitler of History\", inspired by the example of Pieter Geyl's book, \"Napoleon For and Against\", Lukacs examines the state of Hitler scholarship and offers his own observations about Hitler. In Lukacs's view, Hitler was a racist, nationalist, revolutionary and populist. Lukacs criticizes Marxist and liberal historians who claim that the German working class were strongly anti-Nazi and argues that the exact opposite was the case. Each chapter of \"The Hitler of History\" is devoted to a particular topic, such as whether Hitler was a reactionary or revolutionary; a nationalist or a racist; and he examines the roots of Hitler's ideology. Lukacs denies that Hitler developed a belief in racial purity in Vienna under the Habsburg monarchy. Instead, Lukacs dates Hitler's turn to antisemitism to 1919 in Munich, in particular to the events surrounding the Bavarian Soviet Republic and its defeat by the right-wing \"Freikorps\". Much influenced by Rainer Zitelmann's work, Lukacs describes Hitler as a self-conscious, modernizing revolutionary. Citing the critique of National Socialism developed by German conservative historians such as Hans Rothfels and Gerhard Ritter, Lukacs describes the Nazi movement as the culmination of the dark forces which lurk within modern civilization.\n\nIn Lukacs’s view, Operation Barbarossa was not inspired by anti-Communism or any long-term plan to conquer the Soviet Union as suggested by historians such as Andreas Hillgruber, who claims that Hitler had a \"stufenplan\" (stage-by-stage plan), but it was rather an \"ad hoc\" reaction forced on Hitler in 1940–1941 by Britain’s refusal to surrender. Lukacs argues that the reason Hitler gave for the invasion of Russia was the real one. He claimed that Britain would not surrender because Winston Churchill held out the hope that the Soviet Union might enter the war on the Allied side and so Germany had to eliminate that hope. However, other historians have argued that the reason was just a pretext. For Lukacs, Operation Barbarossa was as much anti-British as it was anti-Soviet. He argues that Hitler's statement in August 1939 to the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, the Swiss diplomat Carl Jacob Burckhardt (\"Everything I undertake is directed against Russia\"), which Hillgruber cited as evidence of Hitler's anti-Soviet intentions, was part of an effort to intimidate Britain and France into abandoning Poland. Lukacs takes issue with Hillgruber's claim that the war against Britain was of \"secondary\" importance to Hitler compared to the war against the Soviet Union. Lukacs has also been one of the leading critics of Viktor Suvorov, who has argued that Barbarossa was a \"preventative war\" forced upon Germany by Stalin, who according to Suvorov was planning to attack Germany later in the summer of 1941.\n\nIn his book \"Democracy and Populism: Fear and Hatred\" (2005), Lukacs writes about the current state of American democracy. He warns that the populism he perceives as ascendant in the United States renders it vulnerable to demagoguery. He claims that a transformation from liberal democracy to populism can be seen in the replacement of knowledge and history with propaganda and infotainment. In the same book, Lukacs criticizes legalized abortion, pornography, cloning and sexual permissiveness as marking what he sees as the increasing decadence, depravity, corruption and amorality of modern American society.\n\n\"June 1941: Hitler and Stalin\" (2006) is a book-length study of the two leaders with a focus on the events leading up to Operation Barbarossa. \"George Kennan: A Study of Character\" (2007) is a biography of Lukacs' friend George F. Kennan, based on privileged access to Kennan's private papers. \"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat\" (2008) is a continuation of his work on what Lukacs considered the greatness of Churchill. \"Last Rites\" (2009) continues the \"auto-history\" he published in \"Confessions of an Original Sinner\" (1990). \"The Future of History\" was published on 26 April 2011.\n\nIn \"A Short History of the Twentieth Century\" (2013), Lukacs attempts to challenge the idea (common to both professional historians and experts in international relations) that the Cold War presented a bipolar system or a major strategic rivalry or conflict, instead arguing that the 20th century was one of American dominance. Citing the biographical example of Hitler as well as left- and right-wing populism in the United States, Lukacs also argues in the book that populism was the most destructive force of the 20th century and attempts to disentangle the concept of populism from its frequent (though, Lukacs argues, inaccurate) conflation with the inherent stances of left-wing politics.\n\nIn 1953, he married Helen Elizabeth Schofield, the daughter of a Philadelphia lawyer; the couple had two children. His wife died in 1971. He married his second wife, Stephanie Harvey, in 1974. From this marriage, Lukacs had step-children; his second wife died in 2003. He married for a third time, but his marriage to Pamela Hall ended in divorce.\n\nAfter his retirement in 1994, Lukacs concentrated on writing. He resided in Schuylkill Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania and retained nearly 18,000 books in his home library.\n\nLukacs died from congestive heart failure on May 6, 2019 at his home in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
