It was formed in 1989 and its activities include provision of communication services in the commercial and government sectors (corporate networks, advanced telecommunications services, telephony, videoconferencing, etc.). Hispasat's fleet of satellites broadcast more than 1,250 television channels and radio stations to more than 30 million homes, as well as providing services such as broadband to mobile telephones and landlines.\n\nThe first Hispasat satellite sent into orbit was Hispasat 1A, which was launched on 11 September 1992 on board an Ariane 4 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana. It was put into geostationary orbit at 30° west at a height of 36,000 km, which is the location of all their subsequent satellites serving Spain and Europe.\n\nThe Amazonas satellites (61° west) were inaugurated in 2004 with the launch of Amazonas 1, which serves the American market (mainly Latin America). Amazonas 2 was launched on 1 October 2009 and Amazonas 3 7 February 2013 replacing Amazonas 1, which was moved to a new position at 36° west in September 2013. Amazonas 4A was launched on 22 March 2014. A fifth generation of this satellite series, Amazonas 5, was launched on 11 September 2017.\n\nThe Hispasat Group is formed of Hispasat SA, its subsidiaries Hispasat Canarias, Hispamar Satellites (a joint venture with the Brazilian telephone operator Oi), Hispasat Brazil and associated companies Hisdesat Strategic Services and Galileo Systems and Services.\n\nThe range of Hispasat shareholders demonstrates the company's strategic nature both for the government and the Spanish telecommunications market. In 2012 Hispasat's shareholders included representatives from the Spanish public sector, State Industrial Holding Company (Sepi) with 7.41%, and the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) with 1.85%, and Abertis, a group that specializes in the management of telecommunication's infrastructure and services, with 90.74%.\n\nOn 21 February 2012, the press were informed that Telefónica would sell Abertis its shares in Hispasat, and the Spanish government authorized the sale in December 2012.\n\nAbertis bought 16.42% of Hispasat from the Spanish Ministry of Defence on 25 July 2013, taking its stake in the company to 57.05% - with France's Eutelsat holding 33.69%, Spain's Sepi 7.41% and the country's Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology 1.85%. Abertis sold its stake in Hispasat to Red Eléctrica de España, in February 2019. \n\nHisdesat is a Spanish company created in 2001 by Hispasat (43%), Ingeniería y Servicios Aeroespaciales (30%), EADS CASA (15%, now Airbus), Indra Sistemas (7%) and SENER (5%) with initial investment of 415 million euros.\n\nSatellites:\n\nSource: Hispasat official web site.\n\nIgnis: The IGNIS project (integral communications system for the control of forest fires) is part of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation's Innpacto project. It was launched in September 2011 with the main objective of developing short-term solutions to improve the telecommunications used while fighting forest fires.\n\nSaturno: Hispasat is coordinating the SATURNO Project (SATellite Universal Redistribution NetwOrk). SATURNO is a tractor project, included within the Spanish government's 2010 Plan Avanza for R+D Competitiveness, the plan's main objective is to investigate innovative solutions for content distribution via satellites in the digital home in order to maximise use of existing infrastructure and develop necessary equipment and systems. Solutions developed as part of SATURNO are based on the use of high-speed IP technologies and the reuse of domestic cabling.\n\nJedi: The JEDI project (Just Exploring DImensions) started in 2010 with the objective of improving knowledge regarding the different formats and technologies related to 3D TV and how it will evolve and develop for consumers. JEDI is part of a European research project, ITEA 2, which forms part of the European EUREKA initiatives. Hispasat participates in the European JEDI consortium and is also a partner in the Spanish JEDI consortium collaborating on research and development projects under the aegis of Plan Avanza.\n\nPhidias: PHIDIAS (Hybrid Platform for the Intelligent Diffusion of Applications and Services for Television) is an Avanza Plan project.

He served as Secretary for Scotland between 1916 and 1922 in David Lloyd George's coalition government and as Lord Justice Clerk between 1922 and 1933.\n\nMunro was born in Alness, Ross-shire, the son of Margaret (née Sinclair), daughter of Reverend John Sinclair, and Reverend Alexender Ross Munro. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and the University of Edinburgh.\n\nMunro was admitted to the Scottish Bar as an Advocate in 1893. He was a Counsel to the Board of Inland Revenue and became a King's Counsel in 1910. At the January 1910 general election he was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Wick Burghs, holding the seat until its abolition for the 1918 election. He was then returned to the House of Commons as MP for the new Roxburgh and Selkirk constituency, holding the seat until 1922.\n\nIn 1913 Munro was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Lord Advocate by H. H. Asquith. When David Lloyd George became Prime Minister in December 1916, Munro entered the cabinet as Secretary for Scotland, a post he held until the end of the coalition government in October 1922. The latter year he was appointed to the bench as Lord Justice Clerk and President of Second Division of the Court of Session, taking the judicial title Lord Alness. He also held the office of Honourable Bencher, Lincoln's Inn in 1924.\n\nFollowing his retirement from the bench in 1933, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Alness, of Alness in the County of Ross and Cromarty, on 27 June 1934. He returned to political office in May 1940 when Winston Churchill appointed him a Lord-in-waiting (government whip) in the newly formed war coalition, sitting as a Liberal National. He retained this post (as one of few non-Conservatives) in Churchill's brief 1945 caretaker government. In 1947 he was invested as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nLord Alness was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Edinburgh.\n\nLord Alness was twice married. He married firstly Edith Gwladys Evans, daughter of Reverend John Lewellyan Evans, in 1898. After her death in September 1920 he married secondly Olga Marie Grumler, daughter of Jeanes Georges Grumler, in 1921. Both marriages were childless. Lord Alness died in October 1955, aged 87, when the barony became extinct.\n\n"}

However, the complex lacks in visitor information. There are no exhibits or brochures available to learn more about this large space or guides at hand to provide further details so you have to either go on a tour or explore on your own.\n\nThe fort is believed to have been built between the 12th and 15th century by the Banu Nebhan tribe who inhabited the area at the time and were known for controlling the trade of frankincense at the time.\n\nAs part of the complex, there is also a citadel oasis adjacent to the fort and an ancient wall spanning 13 kilometres part of which are still standing. The majority of the oasis is in ruins but the structure and some of the houses still stand.\n\nAs the fort was built with bricks made of mud and straw, erosion damaged the structure until rehabilitation efforts were launched. There are a lot of legends surrounding the castle.\n\nThere are three main parts inside the fort. The oldest part of the fort is Al-Qasabah.

A central midfielder, he played for SC Heerenveen, BV Veendam, Vålerenga, Molde, Tromsø, and Fredrikstad. He is the older half-brother of Vålerenga player Daniel Fredheim Holm.\n\nHolm won the Tippeligaen with Vålerenga in 2005 and with Molde in 2011. He was capped four times for Norway.\n\nHolm was born in Oslo, and grew up in Trosterud. He played for Vålerenga's youth team but transferred to Eredivisie club SC Heerenveen during the summer of 1998. Holm played as a right back and defensive midfielder under head coach Foppe de Haan, and in 2000 he signed a four-year contract with the club worth 10 million Norwegian kroner.\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Holm was loaned out to BV Veendam., but moved back to Norway and Vålerenga in September 2002. He said that the move, which meant a drop in salary, was due to his belief in Vålerenga's ambitions and their supporters. The head coach of Vålerenga, Kjetil Rekdal had a high view of Holm, and said that he was a talented player with a big future, and the prefect replacement for himself in the midfield after his own retirement. Holm won the Norwegian Cup with Vålerenga in 2002.\n\nHolm was unable to play during most of the 2003 season due to a calf fracture, but in 2004 he was back and was a contributing factor to Vålerenga's good season when they lost the league championship to Rosenborg on goal difference. In the next season, Vålerenga and Holm won the league, one point ahead of Start.\n\nAfter a less active 2007 season, playing only six league games and fourteen games in total, Holm transferred to Molde. In total he played 145 matches for Vålerenga, and scored three goals. He played sixty league-matches during his first three seasons in Molde, and in 2009 he won silver in both the league and the cup with Molde. Nevertheless, after the 2010 season, Molde tried to sell Holm to other clubs but without any success, and Holm played under the leadership of the new manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær, until he was loaned to Tromsø in August 2011 for the rest of the 2011 season. Thus, Holm was both champion and runner-up of the 2011 Tippeligaen, as Molde won the league while Tromsø finished second.\n\nOn 14 January 2012, he signed a two-year contract with Fredrikstad, after leaving Molde on a free transfer, and on 14 April he scored his first goal for the club when Fredrikstad lost 2–1 against Rosenborg at home. He then retired. He became the assistant manager of Nordstrand IF in 2014.\n\nHolm played 38 times for different national youth teams, and 32 times for Norway U21.\n\nAfter a good season with Vålerenga in 2004, Holm made his debut for Norway against Australia at Craven Cottage in November 2004.

{"id": "2158167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158167", "title": "Gerard Hoffnung", "text": "Gerard Hoffnung\n\nGerard Hoffnung (22 March 192528 September 1959) was an artist and musician, best known for his humorous works.\n\nRaised in Germany, Hoffnung was brought to London as a boy, to escape the Nazis. Over the next two decades in England, he became known as a cartoonist, tuba player, impresario, broadcaster and raconteur.\n\nAfter training at two art colleges, Hoffnung taught for a few years, and then turned to drawing, on the staff of English and American publications, and later as a freelance. He published a series of cartoons on musical themes, and illustrated the works of novelists and poets.\n\nIn 1956 Hoffnung mounted the first of his \"Hoffnung Festivals\" in London, at which classical music was spoofed for comic effect, with contributions from many eminent musicians. As a broadcaster he appeared on BBC panel games, where he honed the material for one of his best-known performances, his speech at the Oxford Union in 1958.\n\nBorn in Berlin, and named Gerhard, Hoffnung was the only child of Jewish parents, Hildegard and Ludwig Hoffnung. He was sent to England, where he attended Bunce Court School in 1938. In 1939, his parents left Germany; his father went to Palestine to enter the family's banking business. Gerard went with his mother to London, where she rented a house in Hampstead Garden Suburb, where Hoffnung lived for the rest of his life. In 1939 he enrolled at Highgate School, where, according to one biographer, he was \"remembered for his anarchic spirit\". Among the artists he most admired when he was growing up was Walter Trier, long associated with \"Lilliput\" magazine. Hoffnung had his first cartoon published in the same publication while he was still at school.\n\nAfter leaving Highgate, Hoffnung studied at Hornsey College of Art, but was expelled for his lack of gravity in the life class. He then attended Harrow School of Art, after which he became a schoolmaster. He was art master at Stamford School (1945–46) and assistant art master at Harrow School (1948), with an intervening and overlapping spell as a staff artist on the London \"Evening News\". He was a staff artist to Cowles Magazines Inc in New York in 1950, and otherwise pursued a career as a freelance cartoonist. He contributed to \"Punch\", \"The Strand Magazine\" and \"The Tatler\", and to other British, continental, and American magazines. He also produced advertising work for Kia-Ora, Guinness, and other companies. He presented one-man exhibitions of his work, including one at the Little Gallery, Piccadilly (1949), and two at the Royal Festival Hall (1951 and 1956).\n\nIn the words of his biographer Richard Ingrams, Hoffnung\ndeveloped a distinctive style which owed something to the German illustrator Wilhelm Busch. He mainly drew with a mapping pen and Indian ink, and also used watercolours and wax crayons. His illustrations in colour for Colette's libretto for Ravel's opera \"L'enfant et les sortilèges\" were outstanding.\n\nMuch of Hoffnung's humour centred on the world of music, particularly the various instruments of the orchestra with which he was fascinated. He published a series of books of cartoons poking gentle fun at conductors and orchestral instrumentalists. Examples include the drawing of a musician being devoured by the serpent he is trying to play; another shows a singer whose waistcoat buttons are control knobs labelled On/off, \"ppp/fff\", Wobble, and Sobs. He depicted Malcolm Sargent as \"\"Elegantemente\"\", conducting with a full-length mirror at the front of his rostrum. After Hoffnung's death, some of the cartoons were turned into short animated films by Halas and Batchelor with music by Francis Chagrin in the television series \"Tales from Hoffnung\" (1965).\n\nIn 1950 Hoffnung began a career as a broadcaster for the BBC, as both raconteur and regular contestant in panel games including \"One Minute Please\", the predecessor of \"Just a Minute\". He was, in the words of Ingrams, \"a brilliant improviser with a dry wit and a masterly sense of timing\".\n\nProbably the best-known example of Hoffnung as a humorous speaker is an account of a bricklayer's misfortunes when raising some bricks in a barrel to the top of a building. It was part of a speech to the Oxford Union on 4 December 1958. The derivation of the story is confused, but it first arises in the 1930s. It was published in \"Reader's Digest\" in 1940 as a letter from a naval officer who had supposedly received it from an enlisted man explaining his late return from leave. Hoffnung first saw the story in \"The Manchester Guardian\" in 1957; the version printed there is identical with the text used by Hoffnung, except for the location, which he changed from Barbados to Golders Green. Hoffnung used the piece to warm up the audience before each recording session of \"One Minute, Please\". In these performances he perfected the timing before the Oxford Union speech. The story was part of his speech in a debate called \"Life Begins at 38\" and was recorded by the BBC. The tale itself was not, Ingrams comments, especially funny, but \"[Hoffnung's] manner and delivery reduced his audience to hysterics\".\nAmong Hoffnung's other well-known subjects were his supposedly helpful advice to tourists in London (\"Have you tried the famous echo in the Reading Room of the British Museum?\") and allegedly genuine letters in fallible English from continental hoteliers (\"There is a French widow in every bedroom affording delightful prospects\").\n\nIn 1956 Hoffnung took part in one of the popular \"April Fool's\" concerts in Liverpool, organised by Fritz Spiegl. He took up the idea, and presented a similar, but larger-scale, concert at the Festival Hall in November the same year, in which Spiegl joined him. The \"Hoffnung Music Festival\" played to a sell-out audience in the hall and to BBC viewers throughout Britain. The success of this concert led to two more Hoffnung Festivals, the third of them presented as a tribute after his death. They featured contributions from distinguished musicians. Donald Swann revised Haydn's \"Surprise\" Symphony to make it considerably more surprising. Malcolm Arnold wrote \"A Grand, Grand Overture\", scored for orchestra and vacuum cleaners, and dedicated to US President Hoover. Franz Reizenstein's \"Concerto Popolare\" featured a battle between the soloist, playing the Grieg Piano Concerto, and the orchestra, determinedly playing Tchaikovsky. Sir William Walton conducted a one-note excerpt from his cantata\" Belshazzar's Feast\": the word \"Slain!\" shouted by the chorus. After Hoffnung's death, similar concerts were promoted by his widow, Annetta, and collaborators.\n\nHoffnung learned to play the tuba well enough to play the solo part in the Tuba Concerto by Vaughan Williams in a serious concert at the Festival Hall, and was an active participant in Morley College Orchestra, a respected amateur ensemble in London.\n\nIn 1952 Hoffnung married Annetta Perceval, \"née\" Bennett. They had one son, Ben, and one daughter, Emily, who became respectively a timpanist and a sculptor. Hoffnung's uncle was Bruno Adler, a German art historian and writer who, during the war, wrote for the German language department of the BBC.\n\nIn addition to his public persona as an eccentric and wit, Hoffnung had a deeply serious and moral side. He joined the Quakers in 1955 and was active in their prisoner visiting scheme. According to a biographical sketch by Joel Marks, first published in \"Essays in Arts and Sciences\" (University of New Haven, Volume XXI, 10/1992), \"Hoffnung's outlook on race relations, homosexuality, nuclear disarmament, the treatment of animals (especially hunting) and, for that matter, the music of Bartók and Schoenberg [was] liberal and impassioned.\" A week before he died he took part in a show at the Festival Hall in aid of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, along with Peggy Ashcroft, Benjamin Britten, C. Day Lewis, Michael Redgrave and others.\n\nHoffnung collapsed at his home on 25 September 1959, and died of a cerebral haemorrhage three days later in New End Hospital at the age of thirty-four. The obituarist in \"The Times\" concluded:\n\nPosthumous exhibitions of Hoffnung's work include those at the Berlin Festival (1964); the Brighton and Edinburgh festivals (1968); the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York (1970); the Royal Festival Hall (1984); and Orleans House Gallery, Twickenham, London (1992).\n\nA memorial tribute, \"O Rare Hoffnung\" was published in 1960 and included contributions from Malcolm Arnold, John Dankworth, William Mann, Ian Messiter, Gerald Priestland, Donald Swann and nineteen others. Hoffnung's widow published a biography of him in 1988. In 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast \"Hoffnung – Drawn to Music\", a comedy drama written by Alan Stafford which featured Matt Lucas as Hoffnung and Gina McKee as Annetta, with a cameo appearance by the real Annetta Hoffnung.\n\n\nThe six volumes were reissued as a uniform set in 2002 with forewords by Sir Simon Rattle, Peter Ustinov, Ronald Searle, Harry Enfield, Ian Hislop, and Hoffnung's daughter, Emily.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2158168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158168", "title": "Jack Halberstam", "text": "Jack Halberstam\n\nJack Halberstam (; born December 15, 1961), also known as Judith Halberstam, is a tenured Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature and the Institute for Research on Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Columbia University. Prior to this appointment in 2017, Halberstam was a Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity, Gender Studies, and Comparative Literature and the Director of The Center for Feminist Research at University of Southern California (USC). Halberstam was the Associate Professor in the Department of Literature at the University of California at San Diego before working at USC. Halberstam is a gender and queer theorist and author.\n\nFocusing on the topic of tomboys and female masculinity for his writings, his 1998 \"Female Masculinity\" book discusses a common by-product of gender binarism, termed \"the bathroom problem\" with outlining the dangerous and awkward dilemma of a perceived gender deviant's justification of presence in a gender-policed zone, such as a public bathroom, and the identity implications of \"passing\" therein. Assigned female at birth, he accepts masculine and feminine pronouns, and the name \"Judith\" in addition to \"Jack\", for himself. \n\nHalberstam lectures in the United States and internationally on queer failure, sex and media, subcultures, visual culture, gender variance, popular film and animation. Halberstam is currently working on several projects including a book on fascism and (homo)sexuality.\nHalberstam earned a B.A. in English at the University of California, Berkeley in 1985, an M.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1989, and a Ph.D. from the same school in 1991. Halberstam is Jewish of Bohemian descent.\n\nAssigned female at birth, Halberstam goes by the pronouns he/his and the name \"Jack\", but says that he is \"loosey goosey\" and a \"free floater\" when it comes to his gender. He says \"some people call me Jack, my sister calls me Jude, people I've known forever call me Judith\" and \"I try not to police any of it. A lot of people call me he, some people call me she, and I let it be a weird mix of things.\" He says that \"the back and forth between \"he\" and \"she\" sort of captures the form that my gender takes nowadays\" and that the floating gender pronouns have captured his refusal to resolve his gender ambiguity. He does, however, say that \"grouping me with someone else who seems to have a female embodiment and then calling us 'ladies', is never, ever ok!\"\n\nIn \"Female Masculinity\" (1998), Halberstam seeks to identify what constitutes masculinity in society and within the individual. The text first suggests that masculinity is a construction that promotes particular brands of male-ness while at the same time subordinating \"alternative masculinities\". The project specifically focuses on the ways female masculinity has been traditionally ignored in academia and society at large. To illustrate a cultural mechanism of subordinating alternative masculinities, Halberstam brings up James Bond and \"GoldenEye\" as an example, noting that gender performance in this film is far from what is traditional: M is the character who \"most convincingly performs masculinity\", Bond can only perform masculinity through his suave clothing and gadgets, and Q can be read \"as a perfect model of the interpenetration of queer and dominant regimes\". This interpretation of these characters challenges long-held ideas about what qualities create masculinity. Halberstam also brings up the example of the tomboy, a clear case of a youthful girl exerting masculine qualities—and raises the complication that within a youthful figure, the idea of masculinity expressed within a female body is less threatening, and only becomes threatening when those masculine tendencies are still apparent as the child progresses in age.\n\nHalberstam then focuses on \"the bathroom problem\". Here, the question of the gender binary is brought up. Halberstam argues that the problem of only having two separate bathrooms for different genders, with no place for people who do not clearly fit into either category to use, is a problem. The assertion is further made that our bathroom system is not adequate for the different genders found in society. The problem of policing that occurs around the bathrooms is also a focal point for examination of the bathroom problem; not only is this a policing on the legal level, but also on the social level. The social aspect of policing, according to Halberstam, makes it even more difficult for people who do not clearly and visibly fall into one category or another to use public restrooms without encountering some sort of violent or uncomfortable situation.\n\nIn \"The Queer Art of Failure\", Halberstam argues that failure can be productive, a way of critiquing capitalism and heteronormativity. Using examples from popular culture, like Pixar animated films, Halberstam explores alternatives to individualism and conformity. L. Ayu Saraswati calls \"The Queer Art of Failure\" \"a groundbreaking book that retheorizes failure and its relationship to the process of knowledge production and being in the world.\"\n\nIn his introduction, Halberstam proposes low theory as a way to deconstruct the normative modes of thought that have established uniform societal definitions of success and failure. Low theory is a term that Halberstam borrows from cultural theorist Stuart Hall, using it to undermine heteronormative definitions of success and to argue that failure to live up to societal standards can open up more creative ways of thinking and being in the world. Halberstam points out that queer and feminine success is always measured by male, heterosexual standards. The failure to live up to these standards, Halberstam argues, can offer unexpected pleasures such as freedom of expression and sexuality.\n\nHalberstam clarifies his points encouraging failure in a lecture called \"On Behalf of Failure\": \"My basic point with failure is that in a world where success is countered in relationship to profit ... or relayed through heteronormative marriage, failure is not a bad place to start for a critique of both capitalism and heteronormativity.\"\n\nHalberstam describes low theory as a \"utility of getting lost over finding our way\". In reference to societal norms and definitions of success, Halberstam asks the reader how to avoid those forms of knowing and being that relegate other forms of knowing to redundancy and irrelevancy.\n\nHalberstam provides several examples of publications, films and popular cultural artifacts in order to aid in explaining the concept of low theory. These include \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"Monsters, Inc.\", \"Little Miss Sunshine\", and the writings of Monique Wittig and Barbara Ehrenreich among others.\n\nIn the first chapter of his book Jack Halberstam focuses on certain animated\nfilms and how they inherently teach children about revolt. He then relates this sort of revolt into her idea about Queer Theory. He opens the chapter by simply stating how animated films \"revel in the domain of failure\". He states how it isn't enough for an animated film to focuses on success and triumph because that it not what happens in childhood. He explains how childhood is \"growing sideways,\" as stated by Kathryn Bond Stockton in her work \"The Queer Child or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century\". Halberstam goes on to speak about how Stockton has shown that childhood is queer in nature but society trains children to be heterosexual, by our parents placing emphasis and guiding their kids toward marriage and heterosexual reproduction. Simply put heterosexuality is made, not born. Halberstam explains that revolt and rebellion are inherent in children, and if these traits weren't, then society would have no reason to train them. He then makes the transition back to animated films, saying how they address the disorderly child who sees the large world beyond his controlling family. These animated films get to the root of the struggle between human and non-human creatures.\nHe gives these animated films a name, calling them \"Pixarvolt\" films. Pixar, referring to the company that created the first-ever computer-animated feature film. Pixarvolts have themes that would never be seen in adult films, according to Halberstam. These films also make subtle and obvious connections between communist revolt and queer embodiment. Halberstam argues that although Marxist scholars have dismissed queer theory as 'body politics', these films do a great job of showing \"that alternative forms of embodiment and desire are central to the struggle against corporate domination\" (Halberstam 29). He begins talking about \"Toy Story\" (1995), the first movie Pixar created. What made \"Toy Story\" such a success was its ability to engage children with the fantasy world of talking, living toys and also capture the nostalgia of older generations by employing the cowboy main character, Woody. He argues that the narratives of the film, past and present, adult and child, live and mechanic, show all the possibilities that this new animation world has created. \"Toy Story\" set the themes that are involved in all Pixarvolt film. These films are interested in social hierarchies, the outside world versus the imaginary world, and these films are all powered by revolution, transformation and rebellion. Most Pixarvolt films deal with escape to a utopian freedom. One such film about an escape to utopia is \"Chicken Run\" (2000). These chickens escape using a natural solution combined with an engineering solution, which is using all the chicken's flying abilities to power one large plane so they can escape. The queer element of this film is that most all these chickens are female so the utopia is full of free green pastures of chickens with only a few roosters around. \"The revolution in this instance is feminist and animated\" (Halberstam 32).\n\nHalberstam then speaks of how humans project our worlds onto animals. He explains the term of human exceptionalism, which he defines in two ways: Humans thinking they are more superior, and unique to other animals and Humans using cruel forms of anthropomorphism. He most speaks about anthropomorphism, which is the attribution of human characteristics to an animal. He speaks of a \"New York Times\" \"Modern Love\" article in which the author begins training her husband with the same techniques she saw the trainer in Sea World using on Shamu the killer whale. Halberstam first knocks how committed this shows humans are to failing structures, like marriage, that we think we ourselves are failing and must try different things. He then goes on to explain how drawing on animal behavior makes humans feel heterosexuality is more natural or primal. She imposes her boring domestic lifestyle on the life of this exotic animal, which is anthropomorphism, just to maintain her flawed sense of natural heterosexuality. Halberstam moves on to talk about the successful documentary, \"March of the Penguins\" (2005). Like other animal documentaries, this humanizes animal life and reduces animals to human ways of life. He explains how this film perpetuates heterosexuality in a false way. The film leaves out key facts about penguins journey to find love and have a baby. The first fact it leaves out is that penguins are not monogamous; they mate for one year and move on. They also leave their babies after they know they are able to swim in the water. The baby penguins then gain five years of their lives on their own, before starting another mating cycle. Halberstam claims, \"the long march of the penguins is proof neither of heterosexuality in nature nor of the reproductive imperative nor of intelligent design\" (Halberstam 41).\nLastly Halberstam talks about monstrous animations and their direct connection to the queer way of thinking. Animation started to create these odd human-like figures that were not human, but not animal either. Halberstam goes on to reference the movie \"Monsters, Inc.\" (2001). In this movie the corporate world relies on screams of little children to power themselves. When one monster goes to scare a little girl, and she is not scared, it scares him partially. Halberstam relates this to allowing the child to stand up to its 'boogeyman'-type figure, but at the same time form an affectionate relationship with the figure. This bond is queer in that it lets the child control the transgression of its own boundaries. It interrupts the more conventional romantic bond with a bond that seems odd and misplaced. He ends the first chapter by giving the differences on Pixarvolt films versus regular animated films. The main difference is that regular animated films stress family, human individuality and extraordinary individuals. Pixarvolt films focus more on collectivity, social bonding and diverse communities. Halberstam explains that, \"Two thematics can transform a potential Pixarvolt film into a tame and conventional cartoon: an overemphasis on nuclear family and a normative investment in coupled romance\" (Halberstam 47). He lastly says how Pixarvolt films show the importance in recognizing weirdness of bodies, sexuality and gender, but do it through other animal worlds.\n\nIn the second chapter of Judith Halberstam's \"The Queer Art of Failure\", Halberstram highlights things such as stupidity, forgetfulness, and how they have impacted views on Queer culture. The second chapter really illuminates how stupidity is viewed differently upon men and women, and how it can sometimes even be a gateway for the queer culture. He highlights certain movies scenes and novels where stupidity and forgetfulness couple together to actually opens the door for certain groups of individuals such as the LGBT community.\n\nHalberstam begins to define stupidity on page 54 where she says \"Stupidity conventionally means different things in relation to different subject positions; for example, stupidity in white men can signify new modes of domination, but stupidity in women of all ethnicities inevitably symbolizes their status as, in psychoanalytic terms, \"castrated\" or impaired.\" Stupidity can mean a variety of things depending on the scenario. Right off the bat he gives an example of how stupidity in men is generalized compared to that of women. Stupidity in women seems to be strictly looked down upon, while stupidity in men can be seen as charming. Women have always been oppressed by the idea, which was created by past hierarchy systems, that women are just not as intelligent as men.. \"Stupidity is as profoundly gendered as knowledge formations in general; thus while unknowing in a man is sometimes rendered as part of masculine charm, unknowing in a woman indicates a lack and a justification of a social order that anyway privileges men. Though we both punish and naturalize female stupidity, we not only forgive stupidity in white men, but we often cannot recognize it as such since white maleness is the identity construct most often associated with mastery, wisdom, and grand narratives.\" White males were the symbolization of knowledge and power, not stupidity. The election of 2004, between George W. Bush and John Kerry, was used as an example of how stupidity is beneficial in certain scenarios for men. John Kerry was the well-educated, hard-working, and well-spoken candidate who gets edged out by George W. Bush, a man who sold himself on being a fun-loving, fun to be around type of guy. Bush sold himself to the public in a way to show that he was just an average person like \"everyone else\". Society loved that he was a Yale student but not a 4.0 kind of student. Stupidity in men does not hurt their chances in society, unlike that of women. In a male-dominated culture, stupidity in men does not have a negative downside. In this case, it actually helped the person. Stupidity can also help shed light on queer culture also.\n\nHalberstam goes on to talk about the movie, \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" and how the film used the stupidity and forgetfulness of the main characters, Jesse and Chester, to show that in given situations that would normally be uncomfortable for heterosexual white males, is not uncomfortable at all. The stupidity of Chester and Jesse in \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" led to many homosexual and transsexual references throughout the film. Halberstam says that by interjecting this idea of forgetting into Jesse and Chester's characters causes a certain queer phenomenon throughout the film. Jesse willingly knew that he was receiving a lap dance from a transsexual, but forgets the social norms that would typically go along with that. Most white heterosexual men would not willingly accept a lap dance from a transsexual, but Jesse is too stupid to realize what is taking place. His stupidity takes sexual orientation out of the equation because he doesn't think about the fact that it's a transsexual giving him the lap dance. Although Massachusetts was the first state to legalize gay marriage in 2004, \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" was released in 2000.). The film brought light to the gay community using stupidity and forgetfulness as a staple. In 2000, gay acceptance was not nearly what it is today, thus making \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" somewhat controversial. It was not until 2015 that same-sex marriage had become legal in all 50 states. Even though it is legal in all 50 states, some states such as Mississippi tried to pass a law that protects those who object to same-sex marriage, but was blocked. The queer culture was brought to light in this film when Jesse and Chester share their convincing kiss at the end in their car next to a heterosexual couple. The stupidity of Jesse and Chester was the gateway into the kiss.\n\nHalberstam says that forgetting is one of the best ways for the queer group to break through. To forget about the past, forget family traditions and start new without having to conform to old societal norms. He goes on to explain that forgetting family as the standard mother and husband is essential to create a gateway for the queer community. We must forget these societal norms in order to make way for equality. Forgetfulness in the case of Dory in the film \"Finding Nemo\" brings about a queer version of selfhood. Since Dory's memory is so bad, it causes her to live in the present and forget about the past essentially. Dory cannot remember her past, causing her to forget and live in the moment. Forgetting is a way to keep the disturbing memories of the past, in the past. Forgetting opens up the doors for new things while suppressing the awful memories. Halberstam notes the importance of forgetfulness in the queer community and how positive that can be. Forgetting in this way can help one handle the stress of being oppressed for being part of a community such as the LGBT which is and has been discriminated against. Forgetting simply makes it easier for those to move on and accept a new beginning.\n\nIn Chapter 6 of The Queer Art of Failure, Judith Halberstam focuses more on the specific works of queer theory scholars, and examines works such as \"Kung Fu Panda\" and \"Disney\", to push her points forward. The sixth chapter truly encompasses the way animation is a \"... rich, technological field for rethinking collectives, transformation identity, animality and post humanity.\" A few of the large and popular examples she uses to prove her point and argue those of queer theory scholars are comparison of \"George W. Bush\" to the \"Kung Fu Panda\", Disney films and cartoons as a form of revolt, and the depth of form in Pixar films, such as \"Finding Nemo\", \"Monsters, Inc.\" and \"A Bug's Life\".\n\nIn the chapter \"Animating Failure: Ending, Fleeing, Surviving\", Halberstam starts off by criticizing the view of Slavoj Zizek on Kung Fu Panda. Zizek compares the panda to George W. Bush, explaining that just like Bush, the panda rose to success because of the system, and that it was inherently tipped in his favor. Halberstam states that Kung Fu Panda \"... joins new forms of animation to new conceptions of the human-animal divide to offer a very different political landscape than the one we inhabit, or at least the one Zizek imagines ...\"\n\nIn addition to Kung Fu Panda, Halberstam goes in-depth on the complexity of animation, specifically in \"A Bug's Life\", where a new form of \"crowd scenes\" were introduced. Once the technique behind the animation of the \"crowd\" is available, you then must make it believable by adding the proper story line. For example, in the film \"Fight Club\", there is a scene of the brain created with much complexity, using L-systems, and is not as much an image of the brain or of cells as it is \"an animation of the theory of cellular life\". The first step to animation is the technique, a \"... heady mix of science, math, biology ...\" However, without the narrative, it will not be effective, and the inner complexity of the image is what propels it forward to accurately represent what it is attempting to.\n\nStop-motion animation is the last point Halberstam touches on in this chapter. She goes into examples of \"SpongeBob SquarePants\", \"Mr. Fox\", \"Chicken Run\" and \"Coraline\" explaining how ideas of racism, entrapment, masculinity and political progression are present heavily in stop-motion films. Themes of remote control and imprisonment are also heavily present in stop-motion animation. The use of stop-motion animation can help evoke different emotions as well. For example, in \"Chicken Run\", the start-stop jerkiness allows the narrative to be even more humorous. Themes of remote control and imprisonment are also heavily present in stop-motion animation. However, we must remember that \"... the comedic soul of \"Chicken Run\" is not its operatic escape ... it's about the viewer's personal relationship with his or her inner chicken.\"\n\n\"Telling Tales\" is an essay concerned with the politics of \"passing\" as well as the ethics of transgender biography. The essay discusses how women who \"pass\" are often accused of being deceptive, and they are subjected to brutal violations which often terminate their lives. Halberstam poses questions about who controls narratives that circulate about the lives of transgender people. The paper discusses \"transgender biography as a sometimes violent, often imprecise project, one which seeks to brutally erase the carefully managed details of the life of a passing person and which recasts the act of passing as deception, dishonesty and fraud\" (Halberstam 14). The essay also provides a brief transgender history that is accompanied by a definition of terms such as female masculinity, transsexual, realness, the 'real', female-to-male transsexuals (FTM), butch, and femme. The author thinks that trans bodies have a certain illegibility, and he is suspicious of \"experts\" who try to read, document, and pin down \"lives filled with contradiction and tension\" (Halberstam 20).\n\nIn \"Gaga Feminism\" Halberstam uses Lady Gaga as a symbol for a new era of sexual and gender expression in the 21st century. The book has been noted as \"a work that engages in the theorizing of contemporary gender relations and their cultural narratives, and the practice of calling for a chaotic upending of normative categories in an act of sociopolitical anarchy.\" Halberstam describes five tenets of Gaga feminism:\n\nHalberstam uses contemporary pop culture examples such as SpongeBob SquarePants, \"Bridesmaids\", and Dory from \"Finding Nemo\" to explore these tenets.\n\n\"In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives\", published in 2005, looks at queer subculture, and proposes a conception of time and space independent of the influence of normative heterosexual/familial lifestyle.\nHalberstam coedits the book series \"Perverse Modernities\" with Lisa Lowe.\n\n\"Trans: A Quick and Quirky Account of Gender Variability\", published in 2018, examines recent developments in the meanings of gender and gendered bodies. Through dissecting gendered language and creations of popular culture, Halberstam presents a complex view of the trans* body and its place in the modern world.\n\nHalberstam is one of six children, including Naomi, Lucy, Michael, Jean and John. Halberstam's father, Heini Halberstam, and mother, Heather Peacock, were married until Heather's death in a car accident in 1971. Heini Halberstam married Doreen Bramley shortly thereafter, and they had a marriage of 42 years until Heini's death on January 25, 2014 in Champaign, Illinois at the age of 87.\n\nHalberstam is openly attracted to women. After a relationship of 12 years, Halberstam has been romantically involved with Macarena Gomez-Barris, a sociology professor from Los Angeles, since 2008. Halberstam has said that he feels no pressure to marry, viewing marriage as a patriarchal institution that should not be a prerequisite for obtaining health care and deeming children \"legitimate\". Halberstam believes that \"the couple form is failing\".\n\nHalberstam has been nominated three times for Lambda Literary Awards, twice for the non-fiction book \"Female Masculinity\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158184", "title": "Credential", "text": "Credential\n\nA credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant\" or \"de facto\" authority or assumed competence to do so.\n\nExamples of credentials include academic diplomas, academic degrees, certifications, security clearances, identification documents, badges, passwords, user names, keys, powers of attorney, and so on. Sometimes publications, such as scientific papers or books, may be viewed as similar to credentials by some people, especially if the publication was peer reviewed or made in a well-known journal or reputable publisher.\n\nA person holding a credential is usually given documentation or secret knowledge (\"e.g.,\" a password or key) as proof of the credential. Sometimes this proof (or a copy of it) is held by a third, trusted party. While in some cases a credential may be as simple as a paper membership card, in other cases, such as diplomas, it involves the presentation of letters directly from the issuer of the credential its faith in the person representing them in a negotiation or meeting.\n\nCounterfeiting of credentials is a constant and serious problem, irrespective of the type of credential. A great deal of effort goes into finding methods to reduce or prevent counterfeiting. In general, the greater the perceived value of the credential, the greater the problem with counterfeiting and the greater the lengths to which the issuer of the credential must go to prevent fraud.\n\nIn diplomacy, credentials, also known as a letter of credence, are documents that ambassadors, diplomatic ministers, plenipotentiary, and chargés d'affaires provide to the government to which they are accredited, for the purpose, chiefly, of communicating to the latter the envoy's diplomatic rank. It also contains a request that full credence be accorded to his official statements. Until his credentials have been presented and found in proper order, an envoy receives no official recognition. \n\nThe credentials of an ambassador or minister plenipotentiary are signed by the head of state, those of a chargé d'affaires by the foreign minister. Diplomatic credentials are granted and withdrawn at the pleasure of the issuing authority, based on widely varying criteria. A receiving government may reject a diplomat’s credentials by declining to receive them, but in practice this rarely happens.\n\nIn medicine, the process of credentialing is a detailed review of all permissions granted a medical doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner at every institution at which he or she has worked in the past, to determine a risk profile for them at a new institution. It vets the practitioner for both receiving practice insurance and the ability to bill to insurance for patient care. As well, it certifies legal and administrative body requirements, such as the Joint Commission. \n\nMedical practitioners must also have credentials in the form of licenses issued by the government of the jurisdictions in which they practice, which they obtain after suitable education, training, and/or practical experience. Most medical credentials are granted for a practice specific group. They may also be withdrawn in the event of fraud or malpractice by their holders. Typically they require continuing education validation and renewal to continue practice.\n\nInformation systems commonly use credentials to control access to information or other resources. The classic combination of a user's account number or name and a secret password is a widely used example of IT credentials. An increasing number of information systems use other forms of documentation of credentials, such as biometrics (fingerprints, voice recognition, retinal scans), X.509, public key certificates, and so on.\n\nOperators of vehicles such as automobiles, boats, and aircraft must have credentials in the form of government-issued licenses in many jurisdictions. Often the documentation of the license consists of a simple card or certificate that the operator keeps on his person while operating the vehicle, backed up by an archival record of the license at some central location. Licenses are granted to operators after a period of successful training and/or examination.\n\nThis type of credential often requires certification of good health and may also require psychological evaluations and screening for substance abuse.\n\nOperator licenses often expire periodically and must be renewed at intervals. Renewal may simply be a formality, or it may require a new round of examinations and training.\n\nCredentials in cryptography establish the identity of a party to communication. Usually they take the form of machine-readable cryptographic keys and/or passwords. Cryptographic credentials may be self-issued, or issued by a trusted third party; in many cases the only criterion for issuance is unambiguous association of the credential with a specific, real individual or other entity. Cryptographic credentials are often designed to expire after a certain period, although this is not mandatory. An x.509 certificate is an example of a cryptographic credential.\n\nIn military and government organizations, and some private organizations, a system of compartmenting information exists to prevent the uncontrolled dissemination of information considered to be sensitive or confidential. Persons with a legitimate need to have access to such information are issued \"security clearances,\" which can be tracked and verified to ensure that no unauthorized persons gain access to protected information.\n\nSecurity clearances are among the most carefully guarded credentials. Often they are granted to individuals only after a lengthy investigation and only after their need to have access to protected information has been adequately justified to the issuing authority. The most elaborate security-clearance systems are found in the world's military organizations. Some credentials of this type are considered so sensitive that their holders are not even permitted to acknowledge that they have them (except to authorized parties). Documentation of security clearances usually consists of records keep at a secure facility and verifiable on demand from authorized parties.\n\nBreaches of security involving security clearances are often punished by specific statutory law, particularly if they occur in the context of deliberate espionage, whereas most other counterfeiting and misuse of credentials is punished by law only when used with deliberate intent to defraud in specific contexts. Security clearances are regularly withdrawn when they are no longer justified, or when the person holding them is determined to be too great a security risk.\n\nIn many democratic nations, press credentials are not required at the national or federal level for any publication of any kind. However, individual corporations, and certain government or military entities require press credentials, such as a press pass, as a formal invitation to members of the press which grants them rights to photographs or videos, press conferences, or interviews. Press credentials indicate that a person has been verified as working for a known publication, and holding a press pass typically allows that person special treatment or access rights.\n\nSome governments impose restrictions on who may work as a journalist, requiring anyone working for the press to carry government-issued credentials. Restricting press credentials can be problematic because of its limitations on freedom of the press, particularly if government leaders selectively grant, withhold, or withdraw press credentials to disallow critique of government policy. Any press coverage published under governments that restrict journalism in this way is often treated with skepticism by others, and may not be considered any more truthful or informative than propaganda.\n\nSome trades and professions in some jurisdictions require special credentials of anyone practicing the trade or profession. These credentials may or may not be associated with specific competencies or skills. In some cases, they exist mainly to control the number of people who are allowed to exercise a trade or profession, in order to control salaries and wages.\n\nPersons acting as merchants, freelancers, etc., may require special credentials in some jurisdictions as well. Here again, the purpose is mainly to control the number of people working in this way, and sometimes also to track them for tax-reporting or other purposes like people evaluation.\n\nThe academic and professional world makes very extensive use of credentials, such as diplomas, degrees, certificates, and certifications, in order to attest to the completion of specific training or education programs by students, to attest to their successful completion of tests and exams, and to provide independent validation of an individual's possession of the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary to practice a particular occupation competently.\n\nDocumentation of academic and professional credentials usually consists of a printed, formal document. The issuing institution often maintains a record of the credential as well. Academic credentials are normally valid for the lifetime of the person to whom they are issued. Professional certifications are normally valid for a limited number of years, based on the pace of change in the certified profession, and require periodic recertification through reexamination (to demonstrate continuing competency as occupational standards of practice evolve) or continuing professional development (to demonstrate continually enhanced competency). \n\nAcquisition of these credentials often leads to increased economic mobility and work opportunity, especially for low-income people.\n\nTitles are credentials that identify a person as belonging to a specific group, such as nobility or aristocracy, or a specific command grade in the military, or in other largely symbolic ways. They may or may not be associated with specific authority, and they do not usually attest to any specific competence or skill (although they may be associated with other credentials that do). A partial list of such titles includes\n\n\n\nDynamics:\n"}
{"id": "2158190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158190", "title": "H. A. Prichard", "text": "H. A. Prichard\n\nHarold Arthur Prichard (30 October 1871 – 29 December 1947), usually cited as H. A. Prichard, was an English philosopher. He was born in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard (a solicitor) and his wife Lucy. Harold Prichard was a scholar of Clifton College from where he won a scholarship to New College, Oxford, to study mathematics. But after taking first-class honours in mathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied Greats (ancient history and philosophy) taking first-class honours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of Hertford College (1895–98) and then of Trinity College (1898–1924). He took early retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of ill health, but recovered and was elected White's Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1928 and became a fellow of Corpus Christi College. He retired in 1937.\n\nPrichard gave an influential defence of ethical intuitionism in his \"Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?\" (1912), wherein he contended that moral philosophy rested chiefly on the desire to provide arguments, starting from non-normative premises, for the principles of obligation that we pre-philosophically accept, such as the principle that one ought to keep one's promises or that one ought not steal. This is a mistake, he argued, both because it is impossible to derive any statement about what one ought to do from statements not concerning obligation (even statements about what is good), and because there is no need to do so since common sense principles of moral obligation are self-evident. The essay laid a groundwork for ethical intuitionism and provided inspiration for some of the most influential moral philosophers, such as John Rawls.\n\nPrichard attacks Utilitarianism as not being capable of forming obligation. He states that one cannot justify an obligation by pointing to the consequences of the obligated action because pointing to the consequences only shows that the action is desirable or advisable, not that it is obligatory. In other words, he claims that, while Utilitarianism may encourage people to do actions which a moral person would do, it cannot create a moral obligation to do those actions.\n\nH. A. Prichard is an ethical intuitionist, meaning he believed that it is through our moral intuitions that we come to know right and wrong. Further, while he believes that moral obligations are justified by reasons, he does not believe that the reasons are external to the obligation itself. For instance, if a person is asked why he ought not torture chipmunks, the only satisfying answer that could be given is that he ought not torture chipmunks.\n\nPrichard, along with other intuitionists, adopts a foundationalist approach to morality. Foundationalism is a theory of epistemology which states that there are certain fundamental principles which are the basis for all other knowledge. In the case of ethics, foundationalists hold that certain fundamental moral rules are their own justification. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong explains:\n\nThe deepest challenge in moral epistemology, as in general epistemology, is raised by a skeptical regress argument: Someone is justified in believing something only if the believer has a reason that is expressible in an inference with premises that the believer is already justified in believing. This requires a chain of inferences that must continue infinitely, close into a circle, or stop arbitrarily. Academic skeptics reject all three options and conclude that there is no way for anyone to be justified in believing anything. The same regress arises for moral beliefs . . . The simplest way to stop this regress is simply to stop. If a believer can work back to a premise that the believer is justified in believing without being able to infer that premise from anything else, then there is no new premise to justify, so the regress goes no further. That is how foundationalists stop the regress in general epistemology. Moral intuitionists apply foundationalism to moral beliefs as a way to stop the skeptical regress regarding moral beliefs.\n\nTherefore, Prichard concludes that just as observation of other people necessitates that other people exist, the observation of a moral obligation necessitates that the obligation exists. Prichard finishes his essay by answering a few obvious problems. Most notably, he explains how people should guarantee the accuracy of their moral intuitions. Clearly, observations can be misleading. For instance, if someone sees a pencil in water, he may conclude that the object in the water is bent. However, when he pulls the pencil from the water, he sees that it is straight. The same can occur with moral intuition. If one begins to doubt one's intuition, one should try to imagine oneself in the moral dilemma related to the decision. If the intuition persists, then the intuition is accurate. Prichard further supports these claims by pointing out how it is illegitimate to doubt previously believed moral intuitions:\n\nWith these considerations in mind, consider the parallel which, as it seems to me, is presented though with certain differences by Moral Philosophy. The sense that we ought to do certain things arises in our unreflective consciousness, being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the various situations in which we find ourselves. At this stage our attitude to these obligations is one of unquestioning confidence. But inevitably the appreciation of the degree to which the execution of these obligations is contrary to our interest raises the doubt whether after all these obligations are, really obligatory, i.e., whether our sense that we ought not to do certain things is not illusion. We then want to have it proved to us that we ought to do so, i.e., to be convinced of this by a process which, as an argument, is different in kind from our original and unreflective appreciation of it. This demand IS, as I have argued, illegitimate. Hence in the first place, if, as is almost universally the case, by Moral Philosophy is meant the knowledge which would satisfy this demand, there is no such knowledge, and all attempts to attain it are doomed to failure because they rest on a mistake, the mistake of supposing the possibility of proving what can only be apprehended directly by an act of moral thinking.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158201", "title": "Mission: Wolf", "text": "Mission: Wolf\n\nMission: Wolf (abbreviated M:W) is a remote wolf sanctuary near Westcliffe, Colorado in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. It houses up to 40 wolves and wolfdog crosses, and works to promote a better understanding of wolves in order to further reintroduction efforts and discourage attempts to keep wolves as pets. \n\nMission: Wolf was founded by Kent Weber and his wife, Tracy Ane Brooks, as a remote shelter for a dozen wolves and wolf-dogs. In the first year of constructing a house, they took in several wolf puppies. As word got out, the site began to attract visitors, who helped expand the site, allowing for the adoption of more wolves. In the peak of Mission: Wolf's adoption frenzy, they had 52 wolves and wolf-dogs, before realizing that there were far more animals than they would be able take in. The number of animals at the sanctuary at any one time is variable.\n\nMisson : Wolf's core goal is to educate the public about wolves, and to clear their reputation as 'The Big Bad Wolf', through experiential education and respect for animals. They also advocate against the breeding of wolf-dogs and owning either wolves or wolf-dogs as pets.\n\nMission: Wolf also has an emphasis on sustainability and respect for the environment. The organization operates on solar power, and sources recycled building materials. Mission: Wolf accepts volunteers on both a short (2 weeks - 1 mo) and long term (1-3 months) basis. Many of the core administrative staff are volunteers as well.\n\nAll the buildings at Mission: Wolf were built by volunteers and with donated materials. M:W is almost completely self-sufficient, using donations to pay for what they need, solar power on sunny days, and a propane generator when it is needed. They accept donations of livestock from ranchers, as well as hunting scraps and roadkill. \n\nMission: Wolf takes in only wolves who were born in captivity. Wolves that are born in captivity can never be returned to the wild, and thus, they live out their lives at Mission: Wolf. As of December 2018, 26 wolves and wolf-dogs live at Mission: Wolf. Since founding, M:W has had to turn down over 9,000 requests to take in wolves and wolf-dogs.\n\nThe sanctuary is open to visitors. There is no specific cost to enter, but donations of cash and in-kind donations are welcomed. The sanctuary is located at the end of of dirt road that climbs to , and weather can make the road difficult or impassible. Depending on the day and the attitude of the animals, visitors may be able to interact directly with the wolves. \n\nMission: Wolf also tours America as a part of its Ambassador Wolf Program, traveling thousands of miles in their Wolfhound, a full-size Greyhound Bus that was converted to be able to house, minimally, two adults and two wolves, and assorted supplies. The Ambassador Program has visited schools, universities, NGOs and nonprofits, as well as governmental organizations. \n\nBeginning in summer 2008, the wolves are all fed a small portion once a day, in what is called daily feed. This is mainly used as a way to provide vitamin supplements and medications to the wolves and check on their health; before that, the wolves had only received the feast-and-famine cycle of two large meals a week, similar to their eating schedule in the wild. This is now called \"big feed\", and still occurs twice a week, though the wolves get slightly less food, as some is stored away for daily feed.\n\n"}

Osraige was a semi-provincial kingdom in south-east Ireland which disappeared following the Norman Invasion of Ireland. A number of important royal Ossorian genealogies are preserved, particularly MS Rawlinson B502, which traces the medieval Mac Giolla Phádraig dynasty back through Óengus Osrithe, who supposedly flourished in the first or second century. and one in the \"Book of Leinster\" (also known as \"\"Lebor na Nuachongbála\"\"). Recent analysis of ninth and tenth century regnal succession in Osraige has suggested that in peaceful times, kingship passed primarily from eldest to youngest brother, before crossing generations and passing to sons and nephews.\n\nThe following kings are listed in all major genealogies, but originate from an early period in Irish protohistory, and likely stem from oral tradition.\n\n\nThe following is a synchronism of the kings of Osraige from historic times until the death Gilla Patraic Ruadh in 1103, after which the kingdom experienced some political fracturing.\n\n\nUpon the death of king Gilla Patráic Ruadh in 1103, two smaller portions of the kingdom broke away from the central polity of Osraige; the area of Mag Lacha in the far north of Osraige became independently ruled by the Ua Caellaide clan, and Desceart Osraige (\"South Osraige\") in the very southern area of Osraige, ruled intermittently by rival members of the Mac Giolla Phádraig clan.\n\n\nThe kingdom of Osraige did not fully disappear after the arrival of Norman mercenaries in Ireland, though it was greatly reduced in size. The lineage of Osraige's Lords remained in power in the northern third of their original territory, having been pushed back through the arrival of William Marshal who sought to consolidate his wife's huge claim to Leinster, including Osraige. The lords who ruled this area were sometimes also known in the annals as ‘Princes of Osraige’, ‘Kings of Upper Osraige’ (or ‘North Osraige’), or ‘Kings of Slieve Bloom’; it was a period when the concept of Irish ‘Kingship’ was being replaced with ‘Lordship’. They generally maintained their independence from the Crown or any shire until the final submission of Barnaby McGillaPatrick in 1537 and his subsequent conversion to the title of 1st Baron Upper Osraige in 1541, however, from the mid 1400s to the early 1500s they were at times in alliance with the House of Ormond as well as the House of Kildare. Fitzpatrick historians such as Carrigan and Shearman could not, in their day, access all available records, and their interpretations of succession are often confusing and ambiguous. The following list may include powerful members of different lines of the family, who may or may not necessarily have been inaugurated as the Mac Gilla Pátraic per se, but who were likely recognized nonetheless as the de facto ruler or potential heir, and noteworthy enough for reference by the annalists and in key records such as Liber Ruber, the Ormond Deeds and the Kildare Rental.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2142, Jeanine learns that Evan was murdered and her investigation uncovers a network of murders of humans and artificial intelligences. The game launched on March 8, 2001 and continued running past its initially scheduled end date on June 29, the film's release date.\n\nPlayers were led through a network of websites created by Warner Bros., registered to fake names, and further clues were given in subsequent promotional materials and events for the film. The game drew a large, tight-knit player base who created online groups dedicated to the game, most prominently the Yahoo! Group Cloudmakers. \"The Beast\" was described as \"unprecedented even by Hollywood standards\" and is considered among the most influential early alternate reality games.\n\n\"The Beast\" centers around the fictional Jeanine Salla, who investigates the death of her friend Evan Chan and discovers a cover-up involving a string of murdered humans and artificial intelligences. Players were led through a network of over forty websites created by Warner Bros. via clues left in trailers, print ads, posters, telephone messages, and live promotional events for the film \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\". The game launched on March 8, 2001 and continued running past its initially scheduled end on June 29, the release date for the film.\n\nSet in 2142, roughly forty years after \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\", Evan Chan is said to be killed in a boating accident aboard his artificial intelligence-enhanced boat Cloudmaker. Dr. Jeanine Salla receives a cryptic message revealing he was murdered and leads an investigation. She discovers that he was having an affair with Venus, a companion bot reprogramed to kill Evan, and that the ensuing cover-up triggers further murders of humans and artificial intelligences. Simultaneously, the Mann Act is brought before the legislature and the president and ultimately put to referendum to decide if artificial intelligence will be treated equal to human citizens.\n\nClues to the game were distributed through trailers, print ads, posters, telephone messages, and live promotional events for the film \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" and even in graffiti in public restrooms in major cities throughout the United States. Online, the game was presented through numerous websites in text, photograph, video, and audio based formats.\n\nPlayers entered the game through one of three entry points, called \"rabbit holes\" by the development team, centering on Dr. Jeanine Salla: trailers and posters credited Jeanine Salla as the production's \"sentient machine therapist\", a phone number hidden in another trailer ultimately led to Jeanine, and a promotional poster sent to technology and entertainment media outlets had a code stating, \"Evan Chan was murdered. Jeanine is the key.\" \"The Beast\" was launched on March 8, 2001; however, only roughly one hundred players discovered the game in the first few weeks.\n\nIn April, Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News received an email from someone calling himself \"claviusbase,\" a reference to \"\", urging he search the internet for Jeanine Salla. He obliged and discovered numerous websites registered to the same IP address, including one for a Bangalore World University, founded in 2028 and claiming to be Jeanine's employer. He posted an article about the websites to the Ain't It Cool News website on April 11, drawing 25 million hits to \"The Beast\" websites that day and over 22,000 messages about \"The Beast\" to Ain't It Cool News over two months. CNN stated that Knowles' article was believed to be the first written about the game.\n\nIn May, during a presentation of \"A.I Artificial Intelligence\" at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, producer Kathleen Kennedy and actor Haley Joel Osment accepted a question from a presumedly planted audience member about their experience working with Jeanine Salla, and Kennedy afterward distributed business cards for Jeanine containing another game clue. Later that month, \"Anti-Robot Militia\" rallies in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles were staged with actors pretending to protest artificial intelligence.\n\nJeanine Salla and other characters of \"The Beast\" are listed in the film's closing credits.\n\nCloudmakers, named after the boat on which Evan was murdered, is a Yahoo! Group and website dedicated to the game. The Cloudmakers website was described to be among the first dedicated to the game. Though the total number of players was uncertain, the Cloudmakers group was said to include a majority of the player base. Before the film's release 4,500 to nearly 5,000 users were registered to the group's message board. The founder of the website stated in June 2001 that the discussion list generated tens of thousands of messages weekly.\nThe game was being developed as it was played. While most players came to the plotlines after they had been solidified, the Cloudmakers group was constantly on the cutting edge of the game, pushing the game's developers and influencing the plot. Warnings and messages sent by Cloudmakers members to characters in the story regularly turned up in the plot, and designs/blueprints and databases produced by the group were referenced by and even featured on in-game websites and magazines (as were the efforts of a smaller group, \"SphereWatch\"). After the game, the Puppetmasters admitted that they relied on the vast storehouse of knowledge amongst the Cloudmakers and other player groups to be able to meet any puzzle the designers created. For instance, a puzzle near the end of The Beast required that the players understand lute tablature, and sure enough there were Cloudmakers who could solve it.\n\nThough \"The Beast\" does not directly reference \"A.I Artificial Intelligence\", the film's producer Kathleen Kennedy stated that the game's intention was develop the film's fictional setting and create a foundation for a series of video games released over five years as part of a \"very elaborate long term project with Microsoft and Xbox\". The project was estimated to cost over $1 million to produce.\n\nJordan Weisman created the original concept, and it was further designed and developed by Elan Lee. Science fiction writer Sean Stewart was brought to the project as head writer.\n\nThe game was originally scheduled to end with the release of the film on June 29, 2001, but it continued running throughout the summer. Ultimately, fifty websites with a total of about one thousand pages were created for the game. To prevent a connection between the websites and \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" promotion, the websites were registered to various individuals with the surname Ghaepetto, a reference to Mister Geppetto, and under fake phone numbers and addresses. The game's creators later became known as the \"Puppetmasters\".. Kevin McLeod was one of the Puppetmasters. He was assisted by Thuc Doan Nguyen on sites like Cybertronics, Eliza's Tea Room and others. Microsoft also initially denied involvement in the game's development, though this was believed to be part of maintaining the integrity of the game's intrigue.\n\nPete Fenlon served as content lead. The name \"The Beast\" was actually the design team's internal appellation which remained undisclosed until the Puppetmasters the game's end; at the time players referred to this endeavor as the \"A.I. webgame\" or, simply, \"The Game\". The narrative visual content fell to director/dp Tarquin Cardona and producers Rudy Callegari and Bob Fagan.\n\nThe game was described by the \"Los Angeles Times\" as \"one of the most elaborate movie promotions ever conceived\" that is \"unprecedented even by Hollywood standards\". \"The Atlantic\" cites it as the \"first truly successful alternate reality game\", and \"Polygon\" stated it was the first of its kind. \"The Beast\" was compared to \"The Blair Witch Project\" marketing campaign, though Knowles felt \"The Blair Witch Project\" campaign was more successful due to the broader appeal of the concept and the longer lifespan of the footage.\n\nKnowles believed that the game's popularity placed pressure on director Steven Spielberg and the studio to produce a film innovative enough to match the interest in the game, stating that the production's secretiveness raised expectations. Despite its success, the game failed to draw an audience to \"A.I Artificial Intelligence\", which domestically grossed less than its budget.\n\n"}

It was established on 7 October 1944 by the Polish Committee of National Liberation, effectively replacing the pre-war police force. The Citizen's Militia would remain the predominant means of policing in Poland until 10 May 1990, when it was transformed back into \"Policja\".\n\nThe term \"milicja\" had been adapted from the cognate term, \"militsiya\", used in several communist countries. The term is derived from \"militia\", which in turn claims its etymology from the concept of a military force composed of ordinary citizens. Contrary to implied meaning, in most cases it represented rather a state-controlled force used to exert political repression on the citizens, especially with its elite ZOMO squads.\n\nUnder both communist and post-communist governments, the Polish police system has traditionally operated under the auspices of national authority. Starting at the end of World War II, Poland fell under the influence of the Soviet Union. In 1948, the country's turn toward Stalinism brought the beginning of totalitarian rule, \"in which one Party ruled autonomously over all sections of society\". The highly centralized nature of the militia and its lack of any great power placed it largely under the control of the Security Bureau, which used it to instill fear in the local populace. The general training was offered in the town of Legionowo. \n\nThe Citizens' Militia was divided into a Public Order Department, Traffic Militia (Highway patrol), Criminal Investigations (Major crimes, forensics), Investigations Militia and an Infrastructure Security Section (Security of government buildings, airports, installations).\n\nThere were regional, district, city and local detachments of the force.\n\nThe ZOMO motorized riot troops, which played the most visible role in quelling demonstrations in 1980 and 1981, were reduced in size somewhat by the early 1990s and renamed Preventive Units of the Citizens' Militia (—OPMO). OPMO forces are restricted to roles such as crowd control at sporting events, ensuring safety in natural disasters, and assisting the regular police. In theory, higher government authority would be required for large OPMO contingents to be used.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1980s, ORMO forces, which at one time numbered as many as 600,000 civilian volunteers, were used to augment regular police personnel at key trouble spots. In the early 1980s, ORMO harassed Solidarity members and prevented independent groups from organizing. Largely staffed by industrial workers who gained substantial privileges by monitoring their peers in the workplace, ORMO was the object of extreme resentment throughout the 1980s. Kiszczak attempted to promote ORMO as a valuable auxiliary police force, but the organization was abolished by the Sejm in 1990.\n\nThe most common types were:\n\n\n"}

It is descended from the Chinese \"sheng\", of the Tang Dynasty era, although the \"shō\" tends to be smaller in size than its contemporary sheng relatives. It consists of 17 slender bamboo pipes, each of which is fitted in its base with a metal free reed. Two of the pipes are silent, although research suggests that they were used in some music during the Heian period.\n\nThe instrument's sound is said to imitate the call of a phoenix, and it is for this reason that the two silent pipes of the \"shō\" are kept—as an aesthetic element, making two symmetrical \"wings\". Similar to the Chinese sheng, the pipes are tuned carefully with a drop of a dense resinous wax preparation containing fine lead shot. As (breath) moisture collected in the \"shō\"'s pipes prevents it from sounding, performers can be seen warming the instrument over a small charcoal brazier or electric burner when they are not playing. The instrument produces sound when the player's breath is inhaled or exhaled, allowing long periods of uninterrupted play. The \"shō\" is one of the three primary woodwind instruments used in gagaku, Japan's imperial court music. Its traditional playing technique in \"gagaku\" involves the use of tone clusters called \"aitake\" (合竹), which move gradually from one to the other, providing accompaniment to the melody.\n\nA larger size of shō, called \"u\" (derived from the Chinese \"yu\"), is little used, although some performers, such as Hiromi Yoshida and Ko Ishikawa, began to revive it in the late 20th century.\n\nA detailed book in English on the shō and the gagaku (court orchestra music) it is associated with is titled \"Music of a Thousand Autumns: The Togaku style of Japanese Court Music\" by Robert Garfias.\n\nThe \"shō\" was first used as a solo instrument for contemporary music by the Japanese performer Mayumi Miyata. Miyata and other \"shō\" players who specialize in contemporary music use specially constructed instruments whose silent pipes are replaced by pipes that sound notes unavailable on the more traditional instrument, giving a wider range of pitches.\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, a number of Japanese composers have created works for the instrument, both solo and in combination with other Japanese and Western instruments. Most prominent among these are Toshi Ichiyanagi, Toru Takemitsu, Takashi Yoshimatsu, Jo Kondo, Maki Ishii, Joji Yuasa, Toshio Hosokawa, and Minoru Miki.\n\nThe American composer John Cage (1912–1992) created several Number Pieces for Miyata just before his death, after having met her during the 1990 Darmstadt summer course. Other notable contemporary performers, many of whom also compose for the \"shō\" and other instruments, include Hideaki Bunno (Japan), Tamami Tono (Japan), Hiromi Yoshida (Japan), Kō Ishikawa (Japan), Remi Miura (Japan), Naoyuki Manabe (Japan), Alessandra Urso (United States), Randy Raine-Reusch (Canada), and Sarah Peebles (Canada). Peebles has extensively incorporated \"shō\" in improvised, composed and electroacoustic contexts, including an album of music with photo essay dedicated to the instrument (\"Delicate Paths–Music for Shō\", Unsounds 2014). Other notable 20th-century composers who also studied the instrument in Japan include Benjamin Britten and Alan Hovhaness, the latter of whom composed two works for the instrument. German avant-garde composer Helmut Lachenmann used the \"shō\" at the climax of his opera, \"Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern\". Otomo Yoshihide, a Japanese experimental improv musician, incorporates the \"shō\" in some of his music. \n\nThe instrument was introduced to a wider audience by the German musician Stephan Micus (in his albums \"Implosions\", \"Life\", and \"Ocean\") and the Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, who used it as the primary instrument in three songs performed by Miyata for the soundtrack album to \"Drawing Restraint 9\", a film by her former boyfriend Matthew Barney, about Japanese culture and whaling. Composer Vache Sharafyan (1966, Armenia) used shō in his composition \"My Lofty Moon\" scored for five eastern and eight western instruments that was premiered by the Atlas Ensemble in Amsterdam's Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in 2007.\n\nIt was played on the ISS by Koichi Wakata.\n\n\n\n"}

Set around the time of World War I, it describes a tragic love triangle involving French Bohemian Jim (Henri Serre), his shy Austrian friend Jules (Oskar Werner), and Jules's girlfriend and later wife Catherine (Jeanne Moreau).\n\nThe film is based on Henri-Pierre Roché's 1953 semi-autobiographical novel describing his relationship with young writer Franz Hessel and Helen Grund, whom Hessel married.\nTruffaut came across the book in the mid-1950s whilst browsing through some secondhand books at a shop along the Seine in Paris. Later he befriended the elderly Roché, who had published his first novel at the age of 74. The author approved of the young director's interest to adapt his work to another medium.\n\nThe film won the 1962 Grand Prix of French film prizes, the Étoile de Cristal, and Jeanne Moreau won that year's prize for best actress.\nThe film ranked 46 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. The soundtrack by Georges Delerue was named as one of the \"10 best soundtracks\" by \"Time\" magazine in its \"All Time 100 Movies\" list.\n\nThe film is set before, during, and after the Great War in several different parts of France, Austria, and Germany. Jules (Oskar Werner) is a shy writer from Austria who forges a friendship with the more extroverted Frenchman, Jim (Henri Serre). They share an interest in the world of the arts and the Bohemian lifestyle. At a slide show, they become entranced with a bust of a goddess and her serene smile and travel to see the ancient statue on an island in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nAfter encounters with several women, they meet the free-spirited, capricious Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a doppelgänger for the statue with the serene smile. The three hang out together. Although she begins a relationship with Jules, both men are affected by her presence and her attitude toward life. Jim continues to be involved with Gilberte, usually seeing her apart from the others. A few days before war is declared, Jules and Catherine move to Austria to get married. Both men serve during the war, on opposing sides; each fears throughout the conflict the potential for facing the other or learning that he might have killed his friend.\n\nAfter the wartime separation, Jim visits, and later stays with, Jules and Catherine in their house in the Black Forest. Jules and Catherine by then have a young daughter, Sabine. Jules confides the tensions in their marriage. He tells Jim that Catherine torments and punishes him at times with numerous affairs, and she once left him and Sabine for six months.\n\nShe flirts with and attempts to seduce Jim, who has never forgotten her. Jules, desperate that Catherine might leave him forever, gives his blessing for Jim to marry Catherine so that he may continue to visit them and see her. For a while, the three adults live happily with Sabine in the same chalet in Austria, until tensions between Jim and Catherine arise because of their inability to have a child.\n\nJim leaves Catherine and returns to Paris. After several exchanges of letters between Catherine and Jim, they resolve to reunite when she learns that she is pregnant. The reunion does not occur after Jules writes to tell Jim that Catherine suffered a miscarriage.\n\nAfter a time, Jim runs into Jules in Paris. He learns that Jules and Catherine have returned to France. Catherine tries to win Jim back, but he rebuffs her, saying he is going to marry Gilberte. Furious, she pulls a gun on him, but he wrestles it away and flees. He later encounters Jules and Catherine in a famous (at that time) movie theater, the Studio des Ursulines.\n\nThe three of them stop at an outdoor cafe. Catherine asks Jim to get into her car, saying she has something to tell him. She asks Jules to watch them and drives the car off a damaged bridge into the river, killing herself and Jim. Jules is left to deal with the ashes of his friends.\n\n\nOne of the products of the French New Wave (\"Nouvelle Vague\"), Truffaut incorporated newsreel footage, photographic stills, freeze frames, panning shots, wipes, masking, dolly shots, and voiceover narration (by Michel Subor). Truffaut's cinematographer was Raoul Coutard, a frequent collaborator with Jean-Luc Godard, who employed the latest lightweight cameras to create an extremely fluid film style. For example, some of the postwar scenes were shot using cameras mounted on bicycles.\n\nThe musical score is by Georges Delerue. One song, \"Le Tourbillon\" (\"The Whirlwind\") by Serge Rezvani, which sums up the turbulence of the lives of the three main characters, became a popular hit.\n\nThe dialogue is predominantly in French, with occasional lines in German and one line in English.\n\nJeanne Moreau incarnates the style of the French New Wave actress. The critic Ginette Vincindeau has defined this as, \"beautiful, but in a kind of natural way; sexy, but intellectual at the same time, a kind of cerebral sexuality—this was the hallmark of the \"nouvelle vague\" woman.\" Though she isn't in the film's title, Catherine is \"the structuring absence. She reconciles two completely opposed ideas of femininity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its name is a play on the word \"amphora\".\n\nThe cup was originally designed by Leslie Buck of the Sherri Cup Co. in 1963, to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops in New York City, and was later much copied by other companies. The original Anthora depicts an image of an Ancient Greek amphora, a Greek key design on the top and bottom rim, and the words \"WE ARE HAPPY TO SERVE YOU\" in an angular typeface resembling ancient Greek, for example with an E resembling a capital sigma (\"Σ\", a letter pronounced like English \"s\"). The blue and white colors were inspired by the flag of Greece. The cup subsequently became the metropolitan area's definitive coffee-to-go cup.\n\nSales of the cup reached 500 million in 1994 (when it was by far the most popular design for the company's cups), but had fallen to about 200 million cups annually by 2005. One \"New York Times\" writer in 1995 called the Anthora \"perhaps the most successful cup in history\". By 2007 it was mentioned in passing in a \"New York Times\" television review as \"one of those endangered artifacts\". \n\nThe trademark was acquired by the Solo Cup Company, which licenses sales of the cup. The Anthora coffee cup is featured in movies and television shows that are set in New York such as \"Goodfellas\", \"The Sopranos\", \"Nurse Jackie\", \"Archer\", \"Brooklyn 99\", \"NYPD Blue\", \"Suits\", \"Friends\", \"Men in Black\", \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"Succession\", the \"Law & Order\" franchise, \"Marvel's Daredevil\", and \"Flight of the Conchords\".\n\nBuck never made royalties from his design, but as a salesman he was well-remunerated for the success of the product. When he retired from Sherri Cup Co. in 1992, he was presented with 10,000 Anthoras printed with a testimonial inscription. After Buck's death in 2010, a \"New York Times\" writer described the motto on the cup as having \"welcome intimations of tenderness, succor and humility\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158262", "title": "Al Hrabosky", "text": "Al Hrabosky\n\nAlan Thomas Hrabosky (; born July 21, 1949) is a former Major League Baseball player from 1970–1982 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Royals and Atlanta Braves and is currently the color commentator on Cardinals regular season broadcasts on FSN Midwest.\n\nHrabosky's nickname is The Mad Hungarian because of his unusual last name and colorful character.\n\nHrabosky played at Savanna High School in Anaheim, California and was originally drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 11th round of the 1967 amateur draft, but did not sign with the club. Two years later the Cardinals made him their first round choice. Within a year, at the age of 20, he made his major league debut, pitching a scoreless inning against the San Diego Padres.\n\nDuring his time with the Cardinals, Hrabosky became a fan favorite for his antics on the mound. When entering a game, he would turn his back to the batter, walk towards second base, vigorously rub the ball between his palms several times, take a deep breath, and pound the ball into his mitt. He would then storm back to the mound, staring down the batter. Although the crowd would roar in delight, most batters were not fond of the pitcher's routine.\n\nArguably, Hrabosky's best year was 1975 when he led the National League in saves with 22 (a career best) en route to winning the \"Sporting News\" \"NL Fireman of the Year\" award. He also finished the season with a career high in wins posting a 13-3 record with an ERA of just 1.67. After eight seasons in St. Louis, the Cardinals traded Hrabosky to the Kansas City Royals in a swap of closers for Mark Littell. Following just two years with the Royals, he was released and signed with the Atlanta Braves. \n\nEarly in his career with the Cardinals, Hrabosky enhanced his menacing appearance with long hair, and a horseshoe moustache. However, when Vern Rapp became the Cardinals manager in 1977, Hrabosky had to cut his hair and shave the moustache.\n\nPerhaps Hrabosky's most memorable performance came during an ABC Monday Night Baseball game on May 9, 1977, against the Cincinnati Reds. In the top of the ninth with the game tied at 5–5, Hrabosky allowed the first three hitters (all left-handed), Ken Griffey, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen to reach base and load the bases. As the Redbirds home crowd roared, Hrabosky went into his \"Mad Hungarian\" routine described above and proceeded to strike out right-handed power hitters George Foster, Johnny Bench, and Bob Bailey. The Cardinals went on to win 6–5 on a Ted Simmons home run in the 10th inning.\n\nOn December 8, 1977, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals for Mark Littell and Buck Martinez. The following year, he went 8–7 for the Royals while having a 2.88 ERA with 20 saves in 75 innings of work and 58 games pitched. He had 60 strikeouts and 35 walks while allowing fewer hits and runs than the year before. He appeared in three games of the ALCS that year, his first and only time pitching in the postseason. He appeared in the eighth inning of Games 1, 2, and 3, allowing a combined total of three hits and one run, although the Royals lost in four games. The following year, he went 9–4 with a 3.74 ERA while having 11 saves in 65 innings. He allowed more hits and runs (67 and 31, respectively) while having 39 strikeouts and 10 walks. He was granted free agency after the season, and he subsequently signed with the Atlanta Braves.\n\nDuring his time with the Braves he saw diminished playing time and recorded just seven saves over three seasons. Hrabosky's last appearance in the majors was on August 18, 1982 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium against the Montreal Expos. He pitched the final two innings of a blowout, allowing four runs on four hits with a strikeout and two home runs (hit by Andre Dawson and Tim Wallach) allowed in a 12–2 loss. Twelve days later, he was released by the Braves. Hrabosky signed with the Chicago White Sox during Spring training in 1983 but retired before the season began. In 13 seasons he recorded 64 wins, 35 losses, and 97 saves with an ERA of 3.10.\n\nFollowing his playing career, he has provided color commentary for Cardinals games since 1985 and has been with Fox Sports Midwest since 1997. Hrabosky also hosted his own radio show on KFNS 590AM in St. Louis. He also serves as an occasional fill-in analyst on the Cardinals Radio Network.\n\n\n, or Retrosheet\n"}
{"id": "2158268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158268", "title": "Livewire (DC Comics)", "text": "Livewire (DC Comics)\n\nLivewire (Leslie Willis) is a fictional supervillainess appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in March 1997 in \"Superman Adventures\" #5. Her first mainstream comic book appearance was in \"Action Comics\" #835 (March 2006).\n\nIn television, the character was voiced by Lori Petty in various tie-ins to the DC animated universe. In live-action Superman-based television series, she has been portrayed by Anna Mae Routledge in \"Smallville\" and Brit Morgan in \"Supergirl\".\n\nLeslie Willis was once a popular and controversial Metropolis radio shock jock. No one was immune to her venomous words, not even Superman. She took cynical joy in attacking him during her broadcasts. Among her audience, Lex Luthor enjoyed listening to her.\n\nOne evening during a severe thunderstorm Willis was hosting a rock concert in honor of her third anniversary working at the radio station in Centennial Park in downtown Metropolis. Ignoring her producer's warnings about the storms, the public safety concerns of Metropolis authorities, and the changeable skies, Willis demanded the show go on.\nIt was at about that time Superman showed up to help the police break up the event. Willis' fans showed support for her by throwing stuff at the Man of Steel, when suddenly, lightning struck the stage, setting it on fire. Superman pushed Willis to safety as a second bolt of lightning electrified the metal tower on the stage; the electricity ran through Superman's body and into a wire on stage which Willis then stepped on, shocking Willis and changing her appearance.\n\nWhen Willis woke up, she saw that her skin had turned ghostly white and her hair turned blue and stood on end. She watched Superman talking to reporters on live TV about the accident: one reporter insinuated that Superman, fed up with Willis's hateful comments, may have pushed her into harm's way to punish her, which he denies of course. Willis angrily blames Superman for the transformation caused by the accident and was about to throw a clock-radio at the TV when the radio suddenly turned on in her hands without being plugged in. She discovered she has the power to control electricity.\n\nWillis then escaped from the hospital by turning herself into an electric current. Confronting Superman, she had rearranged the electrons of the hospital gown she was wearing into a black leotard with a lightning bolt down the front and black boots. She then declared herself to be \"Livewire\" now, and took over telephones, televisions, radios, effectively controlling all of the local media. However, she had to drain electricity to continue her takeover and Superman chased her to a hydroelectric plant and stopped her when he doused her with water. Again hospitalized, Luthor generously pays Willis' hospital bills due to their shared contempt for Superman.\n\nShe had a short-lived alliance with Parasite and later had an alliance with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy.\n\nLori Petty voiced Livewire in \"\" and \"The New Batman Adventures\". An uncredited Maria Canals voiced Livewire in \"Justice League\". Her powers and appearance have striking similarities to the controversial \"Superman Blue\", although predating the arc by three years.\n\nIn an episode of the \"Justice League\" animated series, Livewire teamed up with the Superman Revenge Squad to get revenge on Superman. When some of its members were defeated and Toyman's machine sent Superman into the future with them thinking that Superman is dead, Kalibak and Livewire later attacked the scene of the incident with Copperhead, Volcana, Star Sapphire, and Deadshot. When it came to Season 3 of \"Justice League Unlimited\", Livewire later returned as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society.\n\nIn the \"Superman Adventures\" comics, based on the DCAU animated series, Livewire makes an appearance in issue #5, \"Balance of Power\", the two-part \"War Games\" (#22–23) and in the two-part finale (#65–66), \"Power Play\", the latter also featuring Lex Luthor and Darkseid. She is portrayed more sympathetically in the comics, teaming up with Professor Hamilton and putting all of her energy into stopping Brainiac in \"War Games\", which puts her into a coma until she awakens in \"Power Play\", where she officially reforms.\n\nIn \"Action Comics\" #835, Gail Simone and John Byrne brought Livewire into the mainstream DC Universe, in the same tradition as Harley Quinn.\n\nMuch like the DCAU version of Livewire, before she gained her abilities, she was also a shock jock. Going by the DJ name Leslie, her show was dedicated to bashing upon Superman every night, claiming that Superman was only saving people in the name of grandstanding and showing off. She also shows a disdain for fellow broadcaster Billy Batson, aka Captain Marvel. Her career as a shock jock was cut short when the owner of the station, Miguel, decided to turn the station into a country station (a reference to popular real-world shock jock, Howard Stern, who lost his first DJ job in a similar fashion). Miguel was also quite pleased that she was fired because his wife was saved by Superman.\n\nUnlike the DCAU version of Livewire, she was born with the gift of controlling electricity. Enraged at the loss of her job, she went to the top of the station where she was struck by lightning. Absorbing a large amount of energy from the lightning bolt, her appearance changed to a chalk-white skin with blue hair. With that change, she decided that she would now take her revenge out on Superman.\n\nSuperman was weakened by his battle with the Queen of Fables in the previous issue and was unable to withstand Livewire's attacks. Now too weak to fight her directly he defeated her by cunning, shorting out her powers.\n\nLivewire gets kidnapped along with most of the other Metahumans on Earth by a being dubbed the 'Auctioneer'. This being scours the universe looking for unique items to acquire (often by theft) before selling them to the highest bidder. Livewire's unique powers allow her, Superman and several other captives to escape their containment fields. She teams up with Nightwing, Superman, the Veteran, Blue Jay and other heroes in fleeing their situation and gaining intelligence.\n\nA dampening field provides a psychological barrier against utilizing their powers. With the help of Mister Terrific, who communicates through Livewire's natural electricity, the field is soon neutralized.\n\nDuring the escape attempt, Livewire accidentally creates a link between the makeshift team and every single television on Earth. This proves hard to shut off. Soon the team confronts the Auctioneer. With great difficulty, Livewire gains control over the being's communication systems. Under Superman's suggestions, they threaten to broadcast the Auctioneer's entire database to every alien system possible unless he agrees to release the heroes and leave the Earth alone. He reluctantly does so and returns everyone to Earth. The entire adventure was seen on every Earth TV and due to the Auctioneer selling the dramatic story rights, on many alien planets as well.\n\nDuring this story arc she also shows that she is physically attracted to Nightwing.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" #51, Livewire is shown to be under the control of Starro.\n\nShe recently caused a blackout of Gotham City. However, she is easily defeated by Batgirl VI, who was wearing an insulated Batsuit.\n\nDuring \"Brightest Day\", Livewire is shown battling Wildcat after being possessed by the Starheart.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, Livewire attacks Jimmy Olsen and takes hostages in Las Vegas to get the attention of Superman. Superman then puts a modified version of the suit he had to wear when he was briefly converted into an energy being on Livewire (who promptly changes the S-shield on it to an L-shield), which returns her power levels to normal. She is arrested, but does not receive a hard sentence as she only damaged property, no one was wounded, and Superman spoke on her behalf. Iron Munro also chooses to use his influence in the justice department to help. When asked by Jimmy why he would help Livewire, Superman says that, in America, everyone deserves a second chance. With the help of Iron Munro and Serling Roquette, an employee of S.T.A.R. Labs, Livewire is declared reformed. She and Munro are given signal watches as part of an \"ad hoc\" 'Supermen of America' group that Superman recruits because he comes to understand he cannot be everywhere at once.\n\nIn the new continuity, Livewire appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains after the events of \"Forever Evil\". She has previously faced against Superman, who found himself unable to defeat her, since she is made of pure energy, and teamed up with Batman in order to do so. Her origin is later given in an issue of \"Batgirl\", where it is revealed that Leslie Willis was once a popular vlogger known for her pranks and makeup tutorials. During a stunt where she tried to reroute all the power in the city in order to spell out a dirty message that would be visible from space, she was accidentally electrocuted, granting her superhuman abilities.\n\nLivewire is a being of pure electricity, able to absorb vast quantities of electricity from external sources and transform her entire body into living electricity (her skintight costume is made up of ionized air). She can manipulate electricity (along with electric and magnetic fields) and generate lightning blasts of various intensities. Her lightning blasts are powerful enough to weaken or stun Superman. She can transform her body into an electric arc in order to travel through anything that will conduct an electric current, possess/control electronic devices such as computers and telecommunications networks, and even control the entire electrical grid. In the comics (as stated by Superman in \"Action Comics\" #843) Livewire has the ability to broadcast the energy she has stored in the form of a coherent signal (radio wave, etc.), without directing the energy at a target.\n\nLivewire's main weakness is water. Even a small amount of water will cause her stored energy to go haywire. However, if she has enough power, she can survive being splashed without completely losing her powers and suffering only a minor drain. Livewire has to be drenched in water to be fully drained of her energy. She also has another weakness, silicon dust. When she is coated in a large quantity of the dust, its electrical resistance properties render her powerless.\n\nWhen drained of her electricity, she reverts to her solid form and cannot use most of her abilities or transform into living electricity until absorbing at least a minimal amount of electric power from some source. However, even when depowered, she can direct the flow of free electricity from an exposed energy source to re-power herself.\n\nIn the episode \"\" of \"Superman: The Animated Series\", when she wanted to recharge her powers at a hydroelectric plant, Livewire displayed extraordinary strength by lifting one of the power units that stored electricity that she could drain.\n\nLivewire appears working for Brainiac in \"\".\n\nLivewire appears in \"\"'s prequel comic series.\n\n\n\nAn alternate universe version of Livewire appears in \"\", voiced by Kari Wahlgren. This version is a non-metahuman terrorist armed with an Electric Beam Gun which could surprisingly hold Superman down, but only for a short time before the Kryptonian countered with a blast of heat vision.\n\n\n\n"}

Once covered in deciduous forest, this ecoregion has been degraded through agriculture and the extraction of timber so that it currently has a scanty covering of thorny scrub dominated by such trees as \"Acacia senegal\", \"Acacia leucophloea\" and \"Prosopis cineraria\". Where the soils are particularly saline, there are patches of semi-desert. A number of mammals are found in this habitat and about four hundred species of bird. Some small areas are protected but the collection of firewood and the conversion of the land to subsistence farming continues.\n\nThe ecoregion encircles the Thar Desert and Indus Valley Desert ecoregions. It stretches along the border lowlands and hills between India and Pakistan and includes: the western half of Gujarat (excluding the mountain of Girnar), and extending through Rajasthan, where it is bounded on the southeast by the Aravalli Range; most of Haryana and Punjab states of India as well as the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, extending to the foothills of the Himalayas; in Pakistan, most of Punjab province, extending into easternmost Northwest Frontier and Baluchistan provinces and western Sindh.\n\nThis ecoregion, together with the Thar Desert and Indus Valley Desert ecoregions, form Miklos Udvardy's \"Thar Desert\" Biogeographic province.\n\nThe Northwestern thorn scrub forests are thought to be tropical dry forests that have been degraded through intensive agriculture and grazing into stunted and open thorn scrub, dominated by trees such as \"Acacia senegal\" and \"Acacia leucophloea\", as well as \"Prosopis cineraria\", \"Capparis zeylanica\", and species of \"Salvadora\", \"Gymnosporia\", \"Grewia,\" and \"Gardenia\".

{"id": "2158298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158298", "title": "Visual impairment", "text": "Visual impairment\n\nVisual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses. Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60. The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss. Visual impairment may cause difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving, reading, socializing, and walking.\nThe most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%). Refractive errors include near-sightedness, far-sightedness, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness. Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections. Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, premature birth, or trauma among others. These cases are known as cortical visual impairment. Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement. Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit. Diagnosis is by an eye exam.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environment, and assistive devices.\nAs of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss. 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over the age of 50 years. Rates of visual impairment have decreased since the 1990s. Visual impairments have considerable economic costs both directly due to the cost of treatment and indirectly due to decreased ability to work.\n\nThe definition of visual impairment is reduced vision not corrected by glasses or contact lenses. The World Health Organization uses the following classifications of visual impairment. When the vision in the better eye with best possible glasses correction is:\n\n\nBlindness is defined by the World Health Organization as vision in a person's best eye with best correction of less than 20/500 or a visual field of less than 10 degrees. This definition was set in 1972, and there is ongoing discussion as to whether it should be altered to officially include uncorrected refractive errors.\n\nSeverely sight impaired \n\nSight impaired \n\nLow vision \n\nIn the UK, the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI) is used to certify patients as severely sight impaired or sight impaired. The accompanying guidance for clinical staff states: \"The National Assistance Act 1948 states that a person can be certified as severely sight impaired if they are \"so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eye sight is essential\". Certification is based on whether a person can do any work for which eyesight is essential, not just one particular job (such as their job before becoming blind).\n\nIn practice, the definition depends on individuals' visual acuity and the extent to which their field of vision is restricted. The Department of Health identifies three groups of people who may be classified as severely visually impaired.\n\nThe Department of Health also state that a person is more likely to be classified as severely visually impaired if their eyesight has failed recently or if they are an older individual, both groups being perceived as less able to adapt to their vision loss.\n\nIn the United States, any person with vision that cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in the best eye, or who has 20 degrees (diameter) or less of visual field remaining, is considered legally blind or eligible for disability classification and possible inclusion in certain government sponsored programs.\n\nIn the United States, the terms \"partially sighted\", \"low vision\", \"legally blind\" and \"totally blind\" are used by schools, colleges, and other educational institutions to describe students with visual impairments. They are defined as follows:\n\nIn 1934, the American Medical Association adopted the following definition of blindness:\nCentral visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye.\nThe United States Congress included this definition as part of the Aid to the Blind program in the passed in 1935. In 1972, the Aid to the Blind program and two others combined under Title XVI of the Social Security Act to form the Supplemental Security Income program which states:\nAn individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered for purposes of the first sentence of this subsection as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. An individual shall also be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he is blind as defined under a State plan approved under title X or XVI as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of blindness) for December 1973, so long as he is continuously blind as so defined.\nVisual impairments may take many forms and be of varying degrees. Visual acuity alone is not always a good predictor of the degree of problems a person may have. Someone with relatively good acuity (e.g., 20/40) can have difficulty with daily functioning, while someone with worse acuity (e.g., 20/200) may function reasonably well if their visual demands are not great.\n\nThe American Medical Association has estimated that the loss of one eye equals 25% impairment of the visual system and 24% impairment of the whole person; total loss of vision in both eyes is considered to be 100% visual impairment and 85% impairment of the whole person.\n\nSome people who fall into this category can use their considerable residual vision – their remaining sight – to complete daily tasks without relying on alternative methods. The role of a low vision specialist (optometrist or ophthalmologist) is to maximize the functional level of a patient's vision by optical or non-optical means. Primarily, this is by use of magnification in the form of telescopic systems for distance vision and optical or electronic magnification for near tasks.\n\nPeople with significantly reduced acuity may benefit from training conducted by individuals trained in the provision of technical aids. Low vision rehabilitation professionals, some of whom are connected to an agency for the blind, can provide advice on lighting and contrast to maximize remaining vision. These professionals also have access to non-visual aids, and can instruct patients in their uses.\n\nThe subjects making the most use of rehabilitation instruments, who lived alone, and preserved their own mobility and occupation were the least depressed, with the lowest risk of suicide and the highest level of social integration.\n\nThose with worsening sight and the prognosis of eventual blindness are at comparatively high risk of suicide and thus may be in need of supportive services. Many studies have demonstrated how rapid acceptance of the serious visual handicap has led to a better, more productive compliance with rehabilitation programs. Moreover, psychological distress has been reported to be at its highest when sight loss is not complete, but the prognosis is unfavorable. Therefore, early intervention is imperative for enabling successful psychological adjustment.\n\nBlindness can occur in combination with such conditions as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, hearing impairments, and epilepsy. Blindness in combination with hearing loss is known as deafblindness.\n\nIt has been estimated that over half of completely blind people have non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder, a condition in which a person's circadian rhythm, normally slightly longer than 24 hours, is not entrained (synchronized) to the lightdark cycle.\n\nThe most common causes of visual impairment globally in 2010 were:\n\nThe most common causes of blindness worldwide in 2010 were:\n\nAbout 90% of people who are visually impaired live in the developing world. Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness in the developed world.\n\nAmong working-age adults who are newly blind in England and Wales the most common causes in 2010 were:\n\nCataracts is the congenital and pediatric pathology that describes the greying or opacity of the crystalline lens, which is most commonly caused by intrauterine infections, metabolic disorders, and genetically transmitted syndromes. Cataracts are the leading cause of child and adult blindness that doubles in prevalence with every ten years after the age of 40. Consequently, today cataracts are more common among adults than in children. That is, people face higher chances of developing cataracts as they age. Nonetheless, cataracts tend to have a greater financial and emotional toll upon children as they must undergo expensive diagnosis, long term rehabilitation, and visual assistance. Also, according to the Saudi Journal for Health Sciences, sometimes patients experience irreversible amblyopia after pediatric cataract surgery because the cataracts prevented the normal maturation of vision prior to operation. Despite the great progress in treatment, cataracts remain a global problem in both economically developed and developing countries. At present, with the variant outcomes as well as the unequal access to cataract surgery, the best way to reduce the risk of developing cataracts is to avoid smoking and extensive exposure to sun light (i.e. UV-B rays).\n\nGlaucoma is a congenital and pediatric eye disease characterized by increased pressure within the eye or intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma causes visual field loss as well as severs the optic nerve. Early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma in patients is imperative because glaucoma is triggered by non-specific levels of IOP. Also, another challenge in accurately diagnosing glaucoma is that the disease has four causes: 1) inflammatory ocular hypertension syndrome (IOHS); 2) severe uveitic angle closure; 3) corticosteroid-induced; and 4) a heterogonous mechanism associated with structural change and chronic inflammation. In addition, often pediatric glaucoma differs greatly in cause and management from the glaucoma developed by adults. Currently, the best sign of pediatric glaucoma is an IOP of 21 mm Hg or greater present within a child. One of the most common causes of pediatric glaucoma is cataract removal surgery, which leads to an incidence rate of about 12.2% among infants and 58.7% among 10-year-olds.\n\nChildhood blindness can be caused by conditions related to pregnancy, such as congenital rubella syndrome and retinopathy of prematurity. Leprosy and onchocerciasis each blind approximately 1 million individuals in the developing world.\n\nThe number of individuals blind from trachoma has decreased in the past 10 years from 6 million to 1.3 million, putting it in seventh place on the list of causes of blindness worldwide.\n\nCentral corneal ulceration is also a significant cause of monocular blindness worldwide, accounting for an estimated 850,000 cases of corneal blindness every year in the Indian subcontinent alone. As a result, corneal scarring from all causes is now the fourth greatest cause of global blindness.\n\nEye injuries, most often occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye) throughout the United States. Injuries and cataracts affect the eye itself, while abnormalities such as optic nerve hypoplasia affect the nerve bundle that sends signals from the eye to the back of the brain, which can lead to decreased visual acuity.\n\nCortical blindness results from injuries to the occipital lobe of the brain that prevent the brain from correctly receiving or interpreting signals from the optic nerve. Symptoms of cortical blindness vary greatly across individuals and may be more severe in periods of exhaustion or stress. It is common for people with cortical blindness to have poorer vision later in the day.\n\nBlinding has been used as an act of vengeance and torture in some instances, to deprive a person of a major sense by which they can navigate or interact within the world, act fully independently, and be aware of events surrounding them. An example from the classical realm is Oedipus, who gouges out his own eyes after realizing that he fulfilled the awful prophecy spoken of him. Having crushed the Bulgarians, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II blinded as many as 15,000 prisoners taken in the battle, before releasing them. Contemporary examples include the addition of methods such as acid throwing as a form of disfigurement.\n\nPeople with albinism often have vision loss to the extent that many are legally blind, though few of them actually cannot see. Leber congenital amaurosis can cause total blindness or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood.\n\nRecent advances in mapping of the human genome have identified other genetic causes of low vision or blindness. One such example is Bardet–Biedl syndrome.\n\nRarely, blindness is caused by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with ethanol for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in methylated spirits, denatured ethyl alcohol, to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption. Methylated spirits are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages.\n\n\nIt is important that people be examined by someone specializing in low vision care prior to other rehabilitation training to rule out potential medical or surgical correction for the problem and to establish a careful baseline refraction and prescription of both normal and low vision glasses and optical aids. Only a doctor is qualified to evaluate visual functioning of a compromised visual system effectively. The American Medical Association provides an approach to evaluating visual loss as it affects an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living.\n\nScreening adults who have no symptoms is of uncertain benefit.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 80% of visual loss is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, onchocerciasis, trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that half of blindness in the United States is preventable.\n\nMany people with serious visual impairments can travel independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques. Orientation and mobility specialists are professionals who are specifically trained to teach people with visual impairments how to travel safely, confidently, and independently in the home and the community. These professionals can also help blind people to practice travelling on specific routes which they may use often, such as the route from one's house to a convenience store. Becoming familiar with an environment or route can make it much easier for a blind person to navigate successfully.\n\nTools such as the white cane with a red tip – the international symbol of blindness – may also be used to improve mobility. A long cane is used to extend the user's range of touch sensation. It is usually swung in a low sweeping motion, across the intended path of travel, to detect obstacles. However, techniques for cane travel can vary depending on the user and/or the situation. Some visually impaired persons do not carry these kinds of canes, opting instead for the shorter, lighter identification (ID) cane. Still others require a support cane. The choice depends on the individual's vision, motivation, and other factors.\n\nA small number of people employ guide dogs to assist in mobility. These dogs are trained to navigate around various obstacles, and to indicate when it becomes necessary to go up or down a step. However, the helpfulness of guide dogs is limited by the inability of dogs to understand complex directions. The human half of the guide dog team does the directing, based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training. In this sense, the handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog to the pilot, who gets them there safely.\n\nGPS devices can also be used as a mobility aid. Such software can assist blind people with orientation and navigation, but it is not a replacement for traditional mobility tools such as white canes and guide dogs.\n\nSome blind people are skilled at echolocating silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes. It has been shown that blind echolocation experts use what is normally the \"visual\" part of their brain to process the echoes.\n\nGovernment actions are sometimes taken to make public places more accessible to blind people. Public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities. Tactile paving and audible traffic signals can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets. In addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane, some governments mandate the right-of-way be given to users of white canes or guide dogs.\n\nMost visually impaired people who are not totally blind read print, either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices. Many also read large-print, which is easier for them to read without such devices. A variety of magnifying glasses, some handheld, and some on desktops, can make reading easier for them.\n\nOthers read Braille (or the infrequently used Moon type), or rely on talking books and readers or reading machines, which convert printed text to speech or Braille. They use computers with special hardware such as scanners and refreshable Braille displays as well as software written specifically for the blind, such as optical character recognition applications and screen readers.\n\nSome people access these materials through agencies for the blind, such as the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in the United States, the National Library for the Blind or the RNIB in the United Kingdom.\n\nClosed-circuit televisions, equipment that enlarges and contrasts textual items, are a more high-tech alternative to traditional magnification devices.\n\nThere are also over 100 radio reading services throughout the world that provide people with vision impairments with readings from periodicals over the radio. The International Association of Audio Information Services provides links to all of these organizations.\n\nAccess technology such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and refreshable Braille displays enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications and mobile phones. The availability of assistive technology is increasing, accompanied by concerted efforts to ensure the accessibility of information technology to all potential users, including the blind. Later versions of Microsoft Windows include an Accessibility Wizard & Magnifier for those with partial vision, and Microsoft Narrator, a simple screen reader. Linux distributions (as live CDs) for the blind include Vinux and Adriane Knoppix, the latter developed in part by Adriane Knopper who has a visual impairment. macOS and iOS also come with a built-in screen reader called VoiceOver, while Google TalkBack is built in to most Android devices.\n\nThe movement towards greater web accessibility is opening a far wider number of websites to adaptive technology, making the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers.\n\nExperimental approaches in sensory substitution are beginning to provide access to arbitrary live views from a camera.\n\nModified visual output that includes large print and/or clear simple graphics can be of benefit to users with some residual vision.\n\nBlind people may use talking equipment such as thermometers, watches, clocks, scales, calculators, and compasses. They may also enlarge or mark dials on devices such as ovens and thermostats to make them usable. Other techniques used by blind people to assist them in daily activities include:\n\n\nMost people, once they have been visually impaired for long enough, devise their own adaptive strategies in all areas of personal and professional management.\n\nFor the blind, there are books in braille, audio-books, and text-to-speech computer programs, machines and e-book readers. Low vision people can make use of these tools as well as large-print reading materials and e-book readers that provide large font sizes.\n\nComputers are important tools of integration for the visually impaired person. They allow, using standard or specific programs, screen magnification and conversion of text into sound or touch (Braille line), and are useful for all levels of visual handicap. OCR scanners can, in conjunction with text-to-speech software, read the contents of books and documents aloud via computer. Vendors also build closed-circuit televisions that electronically magnify paper, and even change its contrast and color, for visually impaired users. For more information, consult Assistive technology.\n\nIn adults with low vision there is no conclusive evidence supporting one form of reading aid over another. In several studies stand-mounted devices allowed faster reading than hand-held or portable optical aids. While electronic aids may allow faster reading for individuals with low vision, portability, ease of use, and affordability must be considered for people.\n\nChildren with low vision sometimes have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught the most frequent sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in \"The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks\" by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision. Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and lots of read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many children with low vision can be successfully included in regular education environments. Parents may need to be vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources, for example technology in the classroom, classroom aide time, modified educational materials, and consultation assistance with low vision experts.\n\nCommunication with the visually impaired can be more difficult than communicating with someone who doesn't have vision loss. However, many people are uncomfortable with communicating with the blind, and this can cause communication barriers. One of the biggest obstacles in communicating with visually impaired individuals comes from face-to-face interactions. There are many factors that can cause the sighted to become uncomfortable while communicating face to face. There are many non-verbal factors that hinder communication between the visually impaired and the sighted, more often than verbal factors do. These factors, which Rivka Bialistock mentions in her article, include:\n\n\nThe blind person sends these signals or types of non-verbal communication without being aware that they are doing so. These factors can all affect the way an individual would feel about communicating with the visually impaired. This leaves the visually impaired feeling rejected and lonely.\n\nIn the article \"Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. Or—skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired\", the author, Rivka Bialistock comes up with a method to reduce individuals being uncomfortable with communicating with the visually impaired. This method is called blind-glish or sight-glish, which is a language for the blind, similar to English. For example, babies, who are not born and able to talk right away, communicate through sight-glish, simply seeing everything and communicating non-verbally. This comes naturally to sighted babies, and by teaching this same method to babies with a visual impairment can improve their ability to communicate better, from the very beginning.\n\nTo avoid the rejected feeling of the visually impaired, people need to treat the blind the same way they would treat anyone else, rather than treating them like they have a disability, and need special attention. People may feel that it is improper to, for example, tell their blind child to look at them when they are speaking. However, this contributes to the sight-glish method. It is important to disregard any mental fears or uncomfortable feelings people have while communicating (verbally and non-verbally) face-to-face.\n\nIndividuals with a visual disability not only have to find ways to communicate effectively with the people around them, but their environment as well. The blind or visually impaired rely largely on their other senses such as hearing, touch, and smell in order to understand their surroundings.\n\nSound is one of the most important senses that the blind or visually impaired use in order to locate objects in their surroundings. A form of echolocation is used, similarly to that of a bat. Echolocation from a person's perspective is when the person uses sound waves generated from speech or other forms of noise such as cane tapping, which reflect off of objects and bounce back at the person giving them a rough idea of where the object is. This does not mean they can depict details based on sound but rather where objects are in order to interact, or avoid them. Increases in atmospheric pressure and humidity increase a person's ability to use sound to their advantage as wind or any form of background noise impairs it.\n\nTouch is also an important aspect of how blind or visually impaired people perceive the world. Touch gives immense amount of information in the person's immediate surrounding. Feeling anything with detail gives off information on shape, size, texture, temperature, and many other qualities. Touch also helps with communication; braille is a form of communication in which people use their fingers to feel elevated bumps on a surface and can understand what is meant to be interpreted. There are some issues and limitations with touch as not all objects are accessible to feel, which makes it difficult to perceive the actual object. Another limiting factor is that the learning process of identifying objects with touch is much slower than identifying objects with sight. This is due to the fact the object needs to be approached and carefully felt until a rough idea can be constructed in the brain.\n\nCertain smells can be associated with specific areas and help a person with vision problems to remember a familiar area. This way there is a better chance of recognizing an area's layout in order to navigate themselves through. The same can be said for people as well. Some people have their own special odor that a person with a more trained sense of smell can pick up. A person with an impairment of their vision can use this to recognize people within their vicinity without them saying a word.\n\nVisual impairment can have profound effects on the development of infant and child communication. The language and social development of a child or infant can be very delayed by the inability to see the world around them.\n\nSocial development includes interactions with the people surrounding the infant in the beginning of its life. To a child with vision, a smile from a parent is the first symbol of recognition and communication, and is almost an instant factor of communication. For a visually impaired infant, recognition of a parent's voice will be noticed at approximately two months old, but a smile will only be evoked through touch between parent and baby. This primary form of communication is greatly delayed for the child and will prevent other forms of communication from developing. Social interactions are more complicated because subtle visual cues are missing and facial expressions from others are lost.\n\nDue to delays in a child's communication development, they may appear to be disinterested in social activity with peers, non-communicative and uneducated on how to communicate with other people. This may cause the child to be avoided by peers and consequently overprotected by family members.\n\nWith sight, much of what is learned by a child is learned through imitation of others, whereas a visually impaired child needs very planned instruction directed at the development of postponed imitation. A visually impaired infant may jabber and imitate words sooner than a sighted child, but may show delay when combining words to say themselves, the child may tend to initiate few questions and their use of adjectives is infrequent. Normally the child's sensory experiences are not readily coded into language and this may cause them to store phrases and sentences in their memory and repeat them out of context. The language of the blind child does not seem to mirror their developing knowledge of the world, but rather their knowledge of the language of others.\n\nA visually impaired child may also be hesitant to explore the world around them due to fear of the unknown and also may be discouraged from exploration by overprotective family members. Without concrete experiences, the child is not able to develop meaningful concepts or the language to describe or think about them.\n\nVisual impairment has the ability to create consequences for health and well being. Visual impairment is increasing, especially among older people. It is recognized that those individuals with visual impairment are likely to have limited access to information and healthcare facilities, and may not receive the best care possible because not all health care professionals are aware of specific needs related to vision. Accommodation may require alternative means of communication.\n\nThe WHO estimates that in 2012 there were 285 million visually impaired people in the world, of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.\n\nOf those who are blind 90% live in the developing world. Worldwide for each blind person, an average of 3.4 people have low vision, with country and regional variation ranging from 2.4 to 5.5.\n\nBy age: Visual impairment is unequally distributed across age groups. More than 82% of all people who are blind are 50 years of age and older, although they represent only 19% of the world's population. Due to the expected number of years lived in blindness (blind years), childhood blindness remains a significant problem, with an estimated 1.4 million blind children below age 15.\n\nBy gender: Available studies consistently indicate that in every region of the world, and at all ages, females have a significantly higher risk of being visually impaired than males.\n\nBy geography: Visual impairment is not distributed uniformly throughout the world. More than 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries.\n\nSince the estimates of the 1990s, new data based on the 2002 global population show a reduction in the number of people who are blind or visually impaired, and those who are blind from the effects of infectious diseases, but an increase in the number of people who are blind from conditions related to longer life spans.\n\nIn 1987, it was estimated that 598,000 people in the United States met the legal definition of blindness. Of this number, 58% were over the age of 65. In 1994–1995, 1.3 million Americans reported legal blindness.\n\nTo determine which people qualify for special assistance because of their visual disabilities, various governments have specific definitions for legal blindness. In North America and most of Europe, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity (vision) of 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand from an object to see it—with corrective lenses—with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from . In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind.\nApproximately fifteen percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no light or form perception. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. Low vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.\n\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru depicted the blind in their ceramics.\n\nIn Greek myth, Tiresias was a prophet famous for his clairvoyance. According to one myth, he was blinded by the gods as punishment for revealing their secrets, while another holds that he was blinded as punishment after he saw Athena naked while she was bathing. In the Odyssey, the one-eyed Cyclops Polyphemus captures Odysseus, who blinds Polyphemus to escape. In Norse mythology, Loki tricks the blind god Höðr into killing his brother Baldr, the god of happiness.\n\nThe New Testament contains numerous instances of Jesus performing miracles to heal the blind. According to the Gospels, Jesus healed the two blind men of Galilee, the blind man of Bethsaida, the blind man of Jericho and the man who was born blind.\n\nThe parable of the blind men and an elephant has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of Jain, Buddhist, Sufi and Hindu lore. In various versions of the tale, a group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an elephant to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then compare notes and learn that they are in complete disagreement.\n\n\"Three Blind Mice\" is a medieval English nursery rhyme about three blind mice whose tails are cut off after chasing the farmer's wife. The work is explicitly incongruous, ending with the comment \"Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice?\"\n\nPoet John Milton, who went blind in mid-life, composed On His Blindness, a sonnet about coping with blindness. The work posits that \"[those] who best Bear [God]'s mild yoke, they serve him best.\"\n\nThe Dutch painter and engraver Rembrandt often depicted scenes from the apocryphal Book of Tobit, which tells the story of a blind patriarch who is healed by his son, Tobias, with the help of the archangel Raphael.\n\nSlaver-turned-abolitionist John Newton composed the hymn Amazing Grace about a wretch who \"\"once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.\"\" Blindness, in this sense, is used both metaphorically (to refer to someone who was ignorant but later became knowledgeable) and literally, as a reference to those healed in the Bible. In the later years of his life, Newton himself would go blind.\n\nH. G. Wells' story \"The Country of the Blind\" explores what would happen if a sighted man found himself trapped in a country of blind people to emphasise society's attitude to blind people by turning the situation on its head.\n\nBob Dylan's anti-war song \"Blowin' in the Wind\" twice alludes to metaphorical blindness: \"How many times can a man turn his head // and pretend that he just doesn't see... How many times must a man look up // Before he can see the sky?\"\n\nContemporary fiction contains numerous well-known . Some of these characters can see by means of devices, such as the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil, who can see via his super-human hearing acuity, or \"Star Trek\"'s Geordi La Forge, who can see with the aid of a VISOR, a fictional device that transmits optical signals to his brain.\n\nBlind and partially sighted people participate in sports, such as swimming, snow skiing and athletics. Some sports have been invented or adapted for the blind, such as goalball, association football, cricket, golf, tennis, bowling, and beep baseball. The worldwide authority on sports for the blind is the International Blind Sports Federation. People with vision impairments have participated in the Paralympic Games since the 1976 Toronto summer Paralympics.\n\nThe word \"blind\" (adjective and verb) is often used to signify a lack of knowledge of something. For example, a blind date is a date in which the people involved have not previously met; a blind experiment is one in which information is kept from either the experimenter or the participant to mitigate the placebo effect or observer bias. The expression \"blind leading the blind\" refers to incapable people leading other incapable people. Being blind to something means not understanding or being aware of it. A \"blind spot\" is an area where someone cannot see: for example, where a car driver cannot see because parts of his car's bodywork are in the way; metaphorically, a topic on which an individual is unaware of their own biases, and therefore of the resulting distortions of their own judgements (see Bias blind spot).\n\nA 2008 study tested the effect of using gene therapy to help restore the sight of patients with a rare form of inherited blindness, known as Leber's congenital amaurosis or LCA. Leber's Congenital Amaurosis damages the light receptors in the retina and usually begins affecting sight in early childhood, with worsening vision until complete blindness around the age of 30.\n\nThe study used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the gene called RPE65 directly into the eyes of affected patients. Remarkably, all 3 patients, aged 19, 22 and 25, responded well to the treatment and reported improved vision following the procedure. Due to the age of the patients and the degenerative nature of LCA, the improvement of vision in gene therapy patients is encouraging for researchers. It is hoped that gene therapy may be even more effective in younger LCA patients who have experienced limited vision loss, as well as in other blind or partially blind individuals.\n\nTwo experimental treatments for retinal problems include a cybernetic replacement and transplant of fetal retinal cells.\n\nThere is no high-quality evidence on the effect of assistive technologies on educational outcomes and quality of life in children with low vision as of 2015, nor is there evidence on magnifying reading aids in children. Low-vision rehabilitation does not appear to have an important impact on health-related quality of life, though some low-vision rehabilitation interventions, particularly psychological therapies and methods of enhancing vision, may improve vision-related quality of life in people with sight loss.\n\nStatements that certain species of mammals are \"born blind\" refers to them being born with their eyes closed and their eyelids fused together; the eyes open later. One example is the rabbit. In humans, the eyelids are fused for a while before birth, but open again before the normal birth time; however, very premature babies are sometimes born with their eyes fused shut, and opening later. Other animals, such as the blind mole rat, are truly blind and rely on other senses.\n\nThe theme of blind animals has been a powerful one in literature. Peter Shaffer's Tony Award-winning play, \"Equus\", tells the story of a boy who blinds six horses. Theodore Taylor's classic young adult novel, \"The Trouble With Tuck\", is about a teenage girl, Helen, who trains her blind dog to follow and trust a seeing-eye dog.\n\n"}

The relatively large satellite crater Paschen M partly overlies the southern rim of Paschen, and they nearly form a merged pair with only a section of irregular terrain along their common border. The smaller but well-formed crater Paschen S lies across the southwestern rim of Paschen. As a result, most of the southern rim of Paschen is now gone.\n\nThe remainder of the rim is not in much better condition. It is worn and eroded, with multiple small craterlets along the edge and inner wall. Most of the rim structure has been worn away by subsequent impacts and deposits of ejecta, and now forms a rounded dip into the curving interior. A small chain of craters cuts across the rim and inner wall to the west-northwest. There are several small craterlets in the southeastern part of the floor.\n\nPaschen lies to the east of the larger walled plain Galois, and to the southwest of the huge Hertzsprung. About half a crater diameter to the northeast of Paschen is Wan-Hoo.

Roberts is a founding member of the famed Upright Citizens Brigade improv and sketch comedy troupe.\n\nRoberts was born in Queens, New York, to parents Don and Penny Roberts, but spent the majority of his childhood in Secaucus, New Jersey, where he moved at age four. Roberts is a 1987 graduate of Grinnell College in Iowa, where he majored in theater. After graduating from college, Roberts moved to Milwaukee and eventually to Chicago where he became involved in improvisational comedy, studying improv under comedy legend Del Close.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Roberts and Matt Besser (along with several other Chicago improv comics) would eventually form the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe. Amy Poehler and Matt Walsh would later join the group, forming the \"UCB\" foursome who went on to create their own Comedy Central series and later opened the affiliated Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York and Los Angeles. Both theaters have become well-known hotspots for watching live alternative comedy and improv shows and in recent years have helped launch the careers of many of today's most popular comedians.\n\nRoberts wrote and starred in the limited release film \"Martin & Orloff\", and appeared with memorable supporting roles in films such as \"\", \"Bring It On\", \"\", \"Drillbit Taylor\", \"\" and \"Semi-Pro\". On the Upright Citizens Brigade's sketch series on Comedy Central, Roberts was often seen as the UCB Agent Antoine, but also portrayed many other sketch characters such as Steve Youngblood and Astronaut Mike Birchwood. A running joke on the sketch series was that his character (Agent Antoine) was thought by the other UCB Agents (Colby, Trotter, Adair) to be a cyborg despite his constant assertions to the contrary.\n\nRoberts, along with his other \"UCB\" castmates, has regularly appeared in sketch comedy segments on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" for many years. Roberts also had a recurring character in the sitcom \"Arrested Development\", Dr. Fishman (AKA The Literal Doctor, AKA Dr. Wordsmith), and also returned for several episodes for the shows revived 4th season on Netflix in 2013.\n\nRoberts was one of the additions to the cast of \"Reno 911!\" in its final season, playing the role of Sgt. Jack Declan. In 2010. Roberts starred alongside \"UCB\" partner Matt Walsh in the Spike TV improvised comedy series \"Players\", which was created by Walsh. Roberts and Walsh starred as two brothers who run a sports bar, the two also directed several episodes on the show. The series ran for one season, concluding on August 14, 2010.\n\nIn September 2010, Roberts appeared with Conan O'Brien in a series of commercials promoting O'Brien's new show on TBS. Roberts played the captain of the \"Conan Blimp\", with O'Brien riding along as a passenger.\n\nRoberts has written several screenplays with writing partner Jay Martel, one of which was recently sold to DreamWorks, with Steven Brill in talks to direct. Roberts and Martel wrote the script for the comedy \"Get Hard\", starring Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. Roberts and Martel were also the showrunners for all five seasons of the Comedy Central sketch series \"Key & Peele\". They currently are executive producers and showrunners of the 2016 TV Land series \"Teachers\".\n\nRoberts lives in Agoura Hills, California with his wife Katie and their two children, Declan and Josie.\n\nActor\n\nWriter\n"}

{"id": "2158328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158328", "title": "Precision approach radar", "text": "Precision approach radar\n\nPrecision approach radar (PAR) is a type of radar guidance system designed to provide lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft pilot for landing, until the landing threshold is reached. After the aircraft reaches the decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA), guidance is advisory only. Controllers monitoring the PAR displays observe each aircraft's position and issue instructions to the pilot that keep the aircraft on course and glidepath during final approach. It is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS) but requires control instructions. One type of instrument approach that can make use of PAR is the ground-controlled approach (GCA). Air traffic controllers must transmit a minimum of every 5 seconds to the pilot their relation to the azimuth portion and, once intercepting the glidepath, their elevation. The approach is terminated when the aircraft reaches the OCA/H (Obstacle Clearance Altitude/Height). Nevertheless, information is provided until threshold and aircraft may be monitored by controller until touchdown. Controller in charge of PAR should not be responsible for any duty other than the PAR approach concerned.\n\nThe upper portion of the display indicates elevation, the lower portion azimuth. Controllers must be able to interpret radar returns for the azimuth as a \"top view\" to inform them if the aircraft is left or right of course.\nPrecision approach radars are most frequently used at military air traffic control facilities. Many of these facilities use the AN/FPN-63, AN/MPN, or AN/TPN-22. These radars can provide precision guidance to a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The OJ-333 Radar scope is the indicator which the air traffic controller uses to provide instructions to the pilots.\n\nIn the United States, PAR are used mostly by the Navy. This is because they present a more covert type of precision approach for use on aircraft carriers. An ILS installed on a ship could provide guidance to enemy missiles, but a PAR does not provide accurate guidance without controller instruction.\n\nThere are systems that provide PAR functionality without using primary radar. These non-traditional PAR systems use transponder multilateration, triangulation and/or trilateration.\n\nOne such system, Transponder Landing System (TLS) precisely tracks aircraft using the mode 3/A transponder response received by antenna arrays located near the runway. These antennas are part of a measurement subsystem that is used to precisely determine the aircraft 3-dimensional position using TOA, DTOA and AOA measurement techniques. The aircraft position is then displayed on a high-resolution color graphics terminal that also shows the approach centerline and the glide path. A GCA controller is then able to use this screen for reference to issue GCA instructions to the pilot.\n\nThe signal strength for the secondary surveillance radar subsystem of a non-traditional PAR is not attenuated by rain since the frequency is within the long range band, L-band. Therefore, a non-traditional PAR does not experience noticeable rain fade and in the case of the TLS has an operational range of 60 nm.\n\nThis system is co-operative depending, it means that in the case of transponder failure no aircraft detection will be provided.\n\nA traditional PAR flight inspection procedure is performed without a navigation signal available to compare directly to a truth reference. A traditional PAR is flight inspected by comparing written notes between two observers, one taking notes at a truth reference system such as a theodolite and the other observer taking notes while observing the radar console, see ICAO Document 8071. The Transponder Landing System (TLS) non-traditional PAR can transmit an ILS signal that corresponds to the aircraft position relative to the precision approach. Therefore, the graphical depiction can be directly verified using Instrument Landing System (ILS) flight inspection techniques. This direct measurement removes some ambiguity from the PAR flight inspection process.\n\n\n"}

It is the sixth-tallest building in the city. When completed in 1961, it surpassed the Simms Building to become the tallest building in the state, and was itself surpassed by the Bank of the West Tower two years later.\n\nThe Bank of New Mexico Building, as it was originally known, was built in 1959–1961 on the site of the old Wright's Trading Post building at Fourth and Gold. The building was dedicated on January 16, 1961, in a ceremony featuring Native American dancers and a speech by a sombrero-wearing Winthrop Rockefeller, who was one of the original owners.\n\nThe building's main 12-story block has black tinted glass curtain walls on the north and south sides, while the windowless east and west sides and the protruding elevator shaft on the south side are faced with brick. It sits atop a larger one-story base, with a recessed second story in between. The architect was Willard C. Kruger.\n\nThe Bank of New Mexico Building, as it was originally known, was built in 1959–1961 by the Bank Realty Company, which had Winthrop Rockefeller as one of its main partners. Rockefeller was also one of the developers of Winrock Center and would later be elected governor of Arkansas. Built on a five-lot parcel at 4th Street and Gold Avenue, the building replaced several older structures including Wright's Trading Post. It was dedicated on January 16, 1961, in a ceremony featuring Native American dancers and speeches by Rockefeller, dressed in a sombrero for the occasion, and Chairman of the City Commission Maurice Sanchez. The project's total cost was about $4 million.\n\nDesigned by local architect Willard C. Kruger, the 14-story building surpassed the Simms Building across the street to become the tallest in New Mexico. The 14th floor housed the private Petroleum Club, while the namesake Bank of New Mexico had its headquarters on the ground floor. In 1981, the bank's holding company re-branded its banks with the First Interstate Bank name, and the building was renamed accordingly. The building was given a $5 million remodeling in 1986, which included major mechanical work as well as replacing the original curtain walls with the current black tinted glass. Kruger & Associates were the architects for the remodeling as well, though Kruger himself had died in 1984.\n\nThe bank headquarters eventually ended up in the hands of Norwest Bank, which moved out in 1994 as it already had headquarters nearby. In 1996, The Bank of New Mexico (unrelated to the original bank) moved in and put its name on the building, but this bank was also acquired by Norwest two years later. Since the early 2000s it has been the headquarters of New Mexico Bank & Trust.\n\nThe New Mexico Bank & Trust Building is tall and has 14 above-ground floors plus a mechanical penthouse. It was designed by Willard C. Kruger, who was also the architect of the New Mexico State Capitol among other works. Stylistically, it fits into the International Style and is quite similar in appearance to the older Simms Building across the street. Like the Simms Building, it has curtain walls on the north and south sides, windowless brick on the east and west sides, a recessed second story exposing the structural columns, and a larger one-story base. The curtain walls were originally clear glass alternating with opaque turquoise-colored panels, but this was replaced by black tinted glass set in a coral-colored frame during the 1986 remodeling.

He studied in the United Kingdom and in 1892, entered the House of Commons as an elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunbartonshire. He was elected for a second term from Forfar in 1897 and served in the British Parliament from 1892 to 1895 and 1897 to 1909. He also served as an Aide-de-Camp and secretary to Lord Aberdeen. Sinclair was appointed to the Privy Council in 1905. He served as the Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912 and as the Governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919. He died in 1925.\n\nDuring his tenure as Governor of Madras, Pentland became popular in India for the interest he showed in the indigenous tradition and culture. At the same time, he is also remembered for his crackdown on Annie Besant and leaders of the Home Rule Movement.\n\nA radical Liberal, Sinclair was supportive of reforms aimed at promoting social justice. As noted by Veronica Strong-Boag\n\n\"As much as anyone in the new Cabinet after the 1905 election, he embodied the new liberalism of state intervention on the side of the weak. He was also a staunch proponent of legislation tailored to Scottish circumstances. His advocacy of the Scottish Education Act of 1908, which provided for improved teacher training and school facilities and meals for students, very much followed the spirit of Lord Aberdeen’s practices on his own estates. So, too, did Sinclair’s support for legislation to secure the land rights of Scottish crofters.\"\n\nJohn Sinclair was born at 6 Moray Place, Edinburgh to Captain John Sinclair (1826–1871), an officer in the Bengal Army and Agnes Sinclair, daughter of John Learmonth of Dean who constructed the Dean Bridge of Edinburgh, on 7 July 1860. John Sinclair was the eldest of three sons.\n\nCaptain John Sinclair of Lyth was the grandson of Sir John Sinclair of Barrock, 6th baronet of Dunbeath, and descended from George Sinclair of Mey (himself third son of the 4th Earl of Caithness), who died 1616. He was thus a distant cousin of the contemporary Earls of Caithness who were descended from the 7th Baronet, of Mey.\n\nSinclair was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Wellington College. He left Wellington in 1878 and the next year passed out fifth from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. On completion of the one-year Sandhurst course, Sinclair was commissioned into the 5th Royal Irish Lancers. He served in the Sudan expedition and returned as captain in 1887.\n\nSinclair participated in political activities from an early age. He was among those who moved to Toynbee Hall along with Samuel Augustus Barnett, where he strived to promote education and sport, and was one of the founders of the London Playing Fields Society, a sports ground established for the sake of the poor.\n\nSinclair joined the Liberal Party in the 1880s and contested elections to the House of Commons from the Ayr Burghs in Scotland on the promise of Home Rule for Ireland, but lost.\n\nPentland served as Aide-de-Camp and Official Secretary to Lord Aberdeen while he was serving as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1886, and had the same roles in Canada while Lord Aberdeen was Governor-General there.\n\nIn January 1889 he was elected to the first London County Council as a Progressive councillor representing Finsbury East. He served a single three-year term, retiring from the council in 1892.\n\nIn 1892, Sinclair was elected a Liberal Member of Parliament for Dunbartonshire, a seat he held until 1895, and returned to the Commons representing Forfarshire from 1897 to 1909. He then acted as Parliamentary Secretary to Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman for many years.\n\nHe was appointed a Privy Councillor on 11 December 1905 and was He was created Baron Pentland, of Lyth in the County of Caithness on 15 February 1909.\n\nOn 12 July 1904 he married Lady Marjorie Adeline Gordon (7 December 1880 – 26 July 1970), elder daughter of his former patron the 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair.\n\nThey had two children\n\nPentland served as the Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912. During his tenure, women's suffrage was introduced in the councils and Lavinia Malcolm was elected as provost of Dollar, Clackmannanshire, being both the first lady provost and first lady town councilor in Scotland. Numerous resolutions were passed to implement greater autonomy for Scotland but all of them failed when put to vote.\n\nPentland introduced the Taxation of Land Values (Scotland) Bill which recommended the creation of a new Board of Agriculture for Scotland to implement a sweeping land settlement programme. However, though the bill was approved by the House of Commons it was defeated by the House of Lords. A second government bill by Pentland was also defeated by the House of Lords.\n\nPentland was a favorite of the Prime Minister, Campbell-Bannerman. Pentland's Agriculture Act made the Secretary of Scotland answerable to the House of Commons for issues relating to agriculture. In 1907, he assured Scottish MPs in the House of Commons that the Government is aware of issues that plague Scotland.\n\nPentland was Secretary of State for Scotland during the Oscar Slater miscarriage of justice in 1909. Although he commuted Slater's death penalty to life imprisonment he did not investigate concerns, raised by many including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that the Glasgow Police, James Neil Hart (the Procurator Fiscal) and the Lord Advocate Ure conspired to protect the then influential Charteris and Birrell families of Glasgow. Slater's appeal was upheld in 1928.\n\nIn February 1912, Pentland retired as the Secretary for Scotland and was succeeded by T. McKinnon Wood.\n\nPentland served as the Governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919. For the most part of his tenure as Governor of Madras, British India was embroiled in the First World War.\n\nIn June 1911, Arthur Lawley had commissioned the construction of a railway bridge connecting Pamban Island with the Indian mainland. The existing railway line ended with the town of Ramanathapuram and it was felt that its extension to Pamban island would boost trade and tourism. It would also make it easier for pilgrims to travel to the sacred Hindu shrine of Rameswaram.\n\nThe construction of the 2.06 km long cantilever railway bridge was undertaken by the German engineer Scherzer and completed in 2 years at a cost of Rs. 2,000,000 by 600 workers with no loss of life. The bridge was opened by Lord Pentland for traffic on 24 February 1914. The Pamban bridge is India's largest sea bridge and an UNESCO World Heritage monument.\n\nIn 1914, Pentland invited the Scottish botanist and architect Patrick Geddes to conduct an exhibition on town-planning in Madras city. He reached Madras on 20 December 1914 after journeying overland from Calcutta through Vizagapatam, Guntur and Bellary. Pentland had been interacting with Geddes and was fascinated with his models since 1890.\n\nGeddes had prepared for a detailed exhibition at Madras with a series of illustrations and maps. However, the ship by which they were slated to arrive in Madras, the \"Clan Grant\", was sunk to the south of Cape Comorin by the German ship \"Emden\". This calamity delayed Geddes' visit to Madras by a couple of months and he had to recreate his presentations and illustrations.\n\nThe Cities and Town Planning Exhibition opened in the senate of the Madras University on 17 January 1915 and was inaugurated by the Governor who also gave an introductory speech. Patrick Geddes gave a detailed lecture on cost-effective town planning and sanitation with the aid of real-life examples and a presentation with detailed illustrations and maps.\n\nGeddes spent the next few months in Madras touring the countryside and making reports and illustrations of the different towns in the Presidency. He persuaded Pentland to appoint a town planning advisor and suggested the name of H. V. Lancaster who was a Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Accordingly, in October 1915, Lancaster joined the service of the Madras government.\n\nPentland set up a hospital ship which plied regularly between Africa and India and then, between India and the Middle East, caring for sailors injured at sea and treating them. This hospital ship was paid for and maintained by some of the prominent citizens of Madras.\n\nIn 1914, the Department of Industries, which had earlier been disbanded in face of protests from the Madras Chamber of Commerce, was re-established. This department commenced the rapid industrialization of the province to cater to the economic and industrialization needs of the war. Factories manufacturing soap, ink, adhesives, paper-making, oil-pressing, food processing and decoration of groundnuts were established all over the province. Industries were set for manufacturing military equipment for the British army.\n\nOn 22 September 1914, the German cruiser \"Emden\" which was patrolling the Bay of Bengal launched a surprise attack on Madras shelling the oil tanks of the Burmah Oil Company that we set up on the shore. Five tanks were hit out of which two caught fire. Nearly, 425,000 gallons of oil were lost in the attack. Three Indians were killed and the Indian liner \"Chupra\" was damaged in the attack. The battle lasted fifteen minutes and \"Emden\" sailed away towards Pondicherry when the coastal defenses of Madras started to retaliate.\n\nThough the casualties due to the attack were minimal, there was a great deal of material damage caused by the shelling. The people of Madras were terrified by these attacks that \"SMS Emden\" has carved out a place for itself in local folklore.\n\nIn 1915, the Home Rule Movement was started in order to demand home rule for India. In Madras, it was led by Irishwoman Annie Besant and Sir S. Subramania Iyer. As the movement gathered strength, Pentland responded with Annie Besant's arrest in June 1917 for hoisting the provisional flag of free India and a crackdown on the leaders of the movement. Other freedom-fighter as George Arundale and B. P. Wadia were subsequently arrested. These arrests were strongly condemned and her case argued by Mohammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nLord and Lady Pentland were deeply interested in Hindu religion and philosophy.

However, in the Norse tradition the Heaðobards had apparently been forgotten and the conflict is instead rendered as a family feud, or as a conflict with the Saxons, where the Danes take the place of the Heaðobards.\n\nIn \"Beowulf\", the Heaðobards are involved in a war with the Danes. When Beowulf reports on his adventure in Denmark to his king Hygelac, he mentions that Hroðgar had a daughter, Freawaru. Since Froda had been killed by the Danes, Hroðgar sent Freawaru to marry Ingeld, in an unsuccessful attempt to end the feud. An old warrior urged the Heaðobards to revenge, and Beowulf predicts to Hygelac that Ingeld will turn against his father-in-law Hroðgar. In a version given in the Danish chronicle \"Gesta Danorum\", the old warrior appears as Starkad, and he succeeded in making Ingeld divorce his bride and in turning him against her family. Earlier in the \"Beowulf\" poem, the poet tells us that the hall Heorot was eventually destroyed by fire, see quote (Gummere's translation):\n\nIt is tempting to interpret the new war with Ingeld as leading to the burning of the hall of Heorot, as Sophus Bugge did, but the poem separates the two events (by a \"ne wæs hit lenge þā\" meaning \"nor far way was that day when\", in Gummere's translation).\n\nWhereas \"Beowulf\" never dwells on the outcome of the battle with Ingeld, the possibly older poem \"Widsith\" refers to Hroðgar and Hroðulf defeating the Heaðobards at Heorot:\n"}

The games can be copied to the hard drive from within the program, or by using a computer with image dumping software that outputs to a specific custom format.\n\nThe HD Loader software does not require an original Sony hard drive to function properly, however some drives may be impossible to attach without modifying connectors. Games may also refuse to detect the drive if it is unofficial.\n\nSony's public stance on HD Loader is that it is not supported and is illegal (it can enable game piracy by allowing games to be installed, then played later without owning the disc). In October, 2006, a federal court in California ordered defendants to pay in excess of $9 million in damages for Digital Millennium Copyright Act violations for selling HD Loader. A clone of the patched version of the official version is being sold as HD Advance, is still being manufactured and can be purchased from many online retailers.\n\nHD Loader is not 100% compatible with all PS2 games. Some incompatibilities exist because game software depends on certain peculiarities of the PS2 drive hardware. Additional incompatibilities arise from the use of dual-layer DVDs in some PS2 games, which are sometimes not parsed properly by HD Loader (incidentally, dual-layer games can only be installed from a PC but as of 0.8c it's possible to install them from HD Loader). Finally, there are intentional impediments introduced by some recent high-profile PS2 titles, such as \"God of War\" and \"Gran Turismo 4\", to prevent them from being executed off the hard drive.\n\nIn response to the limitations of HD Loader, a number of independent programmers have developed patches which extend the functionality of HD Loader to improve game compatibility or different software entirely (e.g., OpenPS2Loader). These include a fix to improve dual-layer support, one to implement a non-aligned data buffer (which allows \"Gradius V\" to be played from the HD), one to defeat newer copy-protection measures (popularly known as the \"God of War\" fix), one to support the new \"slimline\" SCPH-70000 series PlayStation 2 hardware and one to implement 48-bit Logical Block Addressing (which allows HD Loader to take full advantage of hard drives larger than 137 GB; or 128 GiB, as reported by HD Loader) as of 0.7c hard drives of up to 2 Terabytes can be used.\n\nThese unofficial patches have been accumulated into the HD Loader release known as 0.8b, The unofficial HD Loader is currently at version 0.8c as of April 2007. Version 0.8c continues support for 48-bit (up to 2 Terabyte hard drives), patches for \"\", \"\" and \"God of War II\", 3 more modes and support for installing and running dual layer games directly off the hard drive.\n\nSome games need to be patched in order to be played with HD Loader. Another may require using tricks, such as starting the game with an older, digital controller and then switching to DualShock 2, or refuse to install. According to PS2HD.COM, the compatibility rate of patched HD Loader is around 88.2%.\n\nOriginal Playstation games are not compatible with this method.\n\nOfficial HD Loader is extracted and released to the internet as a retaliation to the free library files used in its creation.\n\n0.6d - the first unofficial version that improved game compatibility.\n\n0.7c - fix for Suikoden V, patches for 48bit HDDs (up to 2 Terabytes), DMA modes (UDMA/MDMA) and DVD9 fix to allow dual layer games to be played were added. A stable GUI Patching app was created and allowed one to choose which patches and other various edits to apply to an Official unpatched version. Updated compatibility menu added.\n\n0.7e - patches that fixed Shadow of the Colossus and Super Monkey Ball were added. This version enabled playing many previously incompatible games. Updated compatibility menu and changed modes description.\n\n0.8 - A patch that fixed and the ability to edit the DMA button configuration.\n\n0.8b - fixes a bug with HDL0.8 not installing to HDDs over 128 GB and a few other minor errors. Updated compatibility menu.\n\n0.8b+ - A patch that fixed God of War II was added. This version is known under different names because author did not rename the version. Additionally, this patch breaks support for .\n\n0.8c - A fix for the buffer alignment was added into the GUI Patcher app and made both GOW2 and GTA:LCS run without crashing. This is the current version. The unofficial releases can be run on a console with a modchip installed, or by using an exploit such as Free McBoot or PS2 Independence Exploit.\n\nHD Advance is a cloned version of the HD Loader software for the PlayStation 2, which allow users to play games installed to the optional hard drive peripheral available for the PS2. HD Advance is identical in functionality to many patched versions of HD Loader freely available online (that include DVD-9 support and 48-bit hard drive addressing) - only with a different theme and some changed text strings.\n\nThe only benefit of HD Advance is that it is distributed on a pressed disk, giving a patched version of HD Loader that can run on a console without a modchip installed, and also without the need of the PS2 Independence Exploit or any other software modification.\n\nHowever, players who were using HD Advance 2.0 retail pressed discs (CD or DVD) to format a Maxtor hard disk with 80 GB capacity and subsequently use the disc to play PS2 games from the HDD were reported experiencing a strange problem. HD Loader versions up to 0.7c boot up perfectly via the Independence Exploit but subsequent versions of HD Loader from 0.8 onwards freezes on the splash screen and refuses to start up if formatted with a HD Advance disc. This is possibly due to newer patches that are not in any HD Advance discs;a solution is to reformat the hard disk with HD Loader version 0.8 or higher, which is recommended for newer PS2 games. However, this is not confirmed to work 100% across the board as certain PS2 models (mainly PAL 7xxx consoles) was reported to still freeze at splash screen; a currently-unfixable problem related to HD Loader version 0.8 or higher on PAL single-port network adapter models was the main problem.\n\nOpen PS2 Loader, abbreviated as OPL, is an open-source program that allows playing of commercial games and homebrew installed from external storage devices. . It has support for the Hard Disk Drive (like HD Loader), USB (like HD Advance), and SMB (over network). It also has additional features, like the GSM feature that is used to disable videos and change the resolution of the game output, virtual memory cards (allowing you to save on USB, HDD, or SMB), usage of the DualShock3 controller over USB and Bluetooth (using a dongle) and a cheat engine. The interface of Open PS2 Loader can be customized with themes. It has been developed in version control since September 27, 2009.\n\n"}

It lies in a valley of Cserhát Mountains, surrounded by low peaks. The natural environment is protected.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion, construction of Hollókő castle first began as a means to protect the area against future attacks. At this time, the area around Hollókő was held by the Kacsics noble clan. The castle was first mentioned in records in 1310. The original village was built just below the castle walls. The Ottomans captured the castle in 1552 and for the next 150 years, control alternated between Ottoman and Hungarian forces. At the end of the Ottoman era (1683) the castle and the village were finally abandoned and the present village grew up below. Many of the existing houses were first built around this time. The houses, which contain wood in their structure, have had to be rebuilt many times throughout the years due to periodic fires, the last being in 1909.

It broadcasts lifestyle programming focusing on do-it-yourself projects such as food, design, style, and crafts in connection with maker culture, from which the channel takes its name.\n\nThe channel was first launched on March 5, 2005 and relaunched under its current name on August 24, 2015.\n\nIn December 2001, Glassbox Television was given approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a Category 2 digital specialty channel tentatively called Short TV, a channel described as \"devoted entirely to short form films shot on film, video or created with computer animation. Short TV will showcase Canadian and international cutting edge short form films, from 1 to 40 minutes in length.\" The channel was launched on March 15, 2005 as BiteTV.\n\nIn May 2006, BiteTV won the Pixel award from the 2006 Canadian New Media Award in the category of Excellence in Cross-Platform. In April 2007, BiteTV won an International Emmy in the category of \"Interactive Channel\".\n\nIn June 2010, the CRTC gave Glassbox Television approval for an amendment to its nature of service, allowing it to de-emphasize its focus on short-form programming; with the amendment, BiteTV's programming would instead of consisting entirely of short-form programming, must \"predominantly\" feature such programming. The CRTC also granted BiteTV the ability to add sitcoms and feature films, among other programs. In response to the CRTC decision, on October 22, 2010, BiteTV underwent a format and logo change, focusing entirely on comedy programming, incorporating sitcoms and feature films to its schedule, including additional sketch comedy and stand-up programs.\n\nOn February 13, 2013, with the announcement of the upfront, Bite got a new logo as \"biTe\". There new logo was a typewriter-style feel, 2 new core colors: Eggplant Purple and Gold Yellow, and a new era. The channel changed its slogan from \"Comedy with Bite\" to \"Simply Funny\". There longtime mascot \"B\" was also retired on this date. In 2013, Bite teamed up with Mondo Media and YouTube to create \"Bite on Mondo\", a program in which content creators pitched ideas for new shows. The pitches are funded through Mondo and use YouTube's popularity to decide whether or not they will be picked up. The winning pitches were broadcast on Bite on August 29, 2014. In October 2014, parent company Blue Ant Media, Mondo Media, and Corus Entertainment announced that Teletoon would air a new series featuring shorts from the program. It was expected to premiere in 2016 on Teletoon at Night, but instead premiered on September 4, 2015 as \"Night Sweats\" on Adult Swim.\nBefore rebranding as a comedy channel, BiteTV maintained a multi-panel visual format that differed from most other television channels, with content surrounding programs being broadcast on the channel consisting a display of on-air promotions and upcoming shows, a BiteTV office webcam, a status bar to show the remaining time left in the show, and a feature called \"The Crawl\" that contained pointless facts, weird laws, updates on programming, and the PC Chat 2 Screen function.\n\nThe PC Chat 2 Screen was a function created by BiteTV that let viewers interact with the channel and other viewers by letting them comment on what would appear on-air within minutes. As with early user-generated content meant for television (mainly seen then on MTV and Tech TV), it was subject early on to contributions from viewers containing either inappropriate content or spam links which were not vetted before coming to air, requiring BiteTV to institute human and automatic moderation to keep content broadcast-safe. Programming ceased on August 24, 2015 at midnight, with Bob and Margaret being the last program on this channel.\n\nOn August 18, 2015, it was announced that Bite would be rebranded as Makeful, described as \"a new lifestyle specialty channel celebrating the maker community and the creation of one-of-a-kind, handmade goods.\"\nThe channel rebranded as scheduled on August 24, beginning with a programming slate including \"Miguel's Feast\", \"Fix It & Finish It\", and \"French Collection\".\n"}

The 2010 population was 155.\n\nMina was founded as a railroad town in 1905 and was named for Ferminia Sarras, a large landowner and famed prospector known as the 'Copper Queen.' The Carson and Colorado Railway, a division of Southern Pacific Railroad, had a station in the town. The railroad is long gone, but at one time a local shuttle called the \"Slim Princess\" allowed Native Americans to ride free of charge atop the railcars, and passengers and crew would shoot wild game from open windows. The train moved slowly enough that hunters were able to retrieve their game and reboard.\n\nGee Jon and Hughie Sing were convicted of the August 27, 1921, Mina, Nevada murder of Tom Quong Kee. Gee Jon, a 29-year-old member of the Hop Sing Tong, became the first person to be executed by lethal gas.

They are mentioned as the people of the scop Widsith. They appear to have been the neighbours of the Angles and Offa of Angel, who was involved in a war against them. Perhaps they were a dynasty or clan competing for power with Offa over the rule of the Angles, though Offa slew two Myrging princes, probably the sons of Eadgils (not to be confused with the Swedish king Eadgils); this Eadgils was later killed by Ket and Wig, the sons of Freawine, a governor of Schleswig who challenged Eadgils to combat while he was pillaging in the Angle lands. Freawine was killed in combat and the Myrgings may then have overrun Schleswig, as they are said to have settled or had holdings at Schleswig, though they were eventually defeated by Offa, who extended the boundary with them to Fifeldor.\n\nAlthough the Myrgings only appear in the Old English poem Widsith and not in any other source, there is enough evidence to say that the Myrgings vanished leaving no other trace: if a rival clan, they were assimilated into the surrounding Angles; and if non-Angles conquered by Offa, who was said to have won a great Kingdom, very likely that of the conquered Myrgings, they seem to have been assimilated under his son Angeltheow, who abolished the title of King of the Myrgings.\n\nThe Myrgings lived south of Angeln near the Eider (river) and according to some sources near Schleswig which was the center of the Angles. They were descended from Saxons who probably had settled in that area a few centuries earlier and probably merged with another tribe to form the Myrgings. Kemp Malone, an American etymologist writing in 1944, suggested that the word \"Myrging\" means \"Mire Dweller\" or \"Mire-District Dweller\"; he also suggested that the name points to a miry or marshy habitat for the tribe and that the With-Myrgings were a sub-tribe of Myrgings who expanded across the Eider into Schleswig. Malone claimed that the With-Myrgings lived in the valley of the Vidå river and that they were the ones at war with Offa of Angel. He also said that the With-Myrgings joined the Angles on their migration to Britain.\n\nWidsith lists two kings of the Myrgings. So the following list of the kings is what has been listed in Widsith, with hypothetical dates, and including that on Eadgils' death the Myrgings were conquered by Offa of Angel who installed himself as their king. When he died in 456, his son Angeltheow abolished the kingdom and unified the Myrgings under one ruler. After this the Myrgings disappeared. \n\n Kemp Malone Myrgings.\n"}

The song is named after the actor of the same name due to its similarity to the theme music of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\".\n\nThe song is a mix of electronic music, dub, hip hop and rock. The verses are rapped by Del the Funky Homosapien, portrayed as a blue phantom in the video, while the chorus is sung by Damon Albarn (2-D in the video). It peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart and number 57 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It also reached number one in Italy and charted within the top 20 of many countries around the world. The single has sold 600,000 copies in the UK and has been certified platinum by the BPI. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 38 on its 100 best songs of the 2000s. In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 141 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\". The magazine also ranked it at number 347 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nDemo versions of \"Clint Eastwood\" were originally recorded by Damon Albarn on a four-track using a drum machine and guitar. A re-recording similar to these demos was recorded into Logic for use as a backing track. The strings featured in the song are from a string machine, the Solina String Ensemble. According to engineer, Jason Cox, \"Damon gave us the OK to set fire to it on stage, but we said 'No, you can't set fire to that! It's a classic!'\", and it ended up being used on the song as well as some other tracks on the album. The drums are provided by a drum machine and the main instrument used in the song is the melodica, which Albarn used to make the basic track as well.\n\nSome of the single releases featured an alternative version of the song which featured British hip hop group Phi Life Cypher, who also feature on the group's B-side \"The Sounder\". This was the original version.\n\nFor some live performances of the song, alternative rappers are used. For the 2005 Demon Days tour, a version of the song featuring De La Soul and Bootie Brown, who have also appeared in \"Feel Good Inc.\", \"Superfast Jellyfish\" and \"Dirty Harry\", was written and recorded. This version was released on the CD single of \"DARE\". During the Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour, a third version of the track, featuring British rapper Tinie Tempah, was written and performed. During July 2010, when Tempah was unable to make tour performances, a fourth version of the song, featuring Tempah's verses performed by British grime MC's Kano & Bashy, was devised. Snoop Dogg also performed a rap during the group's 2010 Glastonbury performance. During the group's Asian tour dates, a fifth version of the song, featuring all new verses from Lebanese-Syrian rapper Eslam Jawaad, was performed.\n\nDuring Gorillaz co-creator Damon Albarn's 2014 solo tour for Everyday Robots, he performed the song live with Dan The Automator and Del The Funky Homosapien for the first time. Later in the tour, he played the song with new guest rappers like Vic Mensa, while also bringing back rappers who have previously performed the song with Gorillaz like Bashy and Snoop Dogg.\n\nThe animated music video was directed by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland. It starts with the Gorillaz logo in red against a black screen, and the following quote from the 1978 film \"Dawn of the Dead\": \"Every dead body that is not exterminated, gets up and kills. The people it kills, get up and kill\" in Japanese then in English. This phrase was deemed offensive in some countries and a censored version was produced that omits this intro. The video and song name is a reference to the famous western starring actor Clint Eastwood, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". An interpolation of the yell from the film's theme song, in particular that film's protagonist Tuco's leitmotif, can be heard at the beginning of the video, followed by sinister laughter from Murdoc. The notes that the melodica plays are also based on the yell.\n\nThe band is seen playing their music against a completely white backdrop. 2-D is seen wearing a T-Virus shirt most likely referencing \"Resident Evil\". Russel's cap then begins to mysteriously rise on its own, and the ghost of Del appears to be emerging from under it. He begins to rap, leaving the other band members dumbfounded, and the backdrop slowly develops dark clouds in the sky, and enormous tombstones start to burst out of the ground, and the scene becomes that of a cemetery, as a shower of rain and thunderstorm begins. Shortly afterwards, zombie gorilla hands rise up from the ground. Murdoc is grabbed by the crotch and pulled to the ground, a reference to the Peter Jackson zombie film \"Braindead\". Seconds later, the zombie gorillas themselves rise up. Murdoc immediately flees at the sight of them, with a number of them pursuing him. He then turns and glares at them out of frustration at his inability to escape, and the zombie apes engage in a bizarre dance routine before Murdoc is knocked back by a lightning bolt; this dance routine is similar to the choreography of Michael Jackson's music video \"Thriller\".\n\nNoodle is then shown joyfully skipping along, almost as if she is completely unaware of her surroundings, and in her playful skipping, she delivers a hard kick to one of the zombie gorillas in the face. Immediately afterwards, Del is then sucked back into Russel's head as the gorillas all disintegrate, and the band members are left standing in the cemetery, now bright with sunlight. The video then concludes with a split screen showing each of the four band members and their names. The video has a running time of 4:32, which is significantly different from the album version, which runs for approximately 5:42, however, the album version features about 1:10 of the backing track playing with no vocals over the top. The BPM of the music video is also slightly slower than that of the album version. The video for \"Clint Eastwood\" won an award at the Rushes Soho Short Film Festival Awards in 2001, defeating entries by Blur, Fatboy Slim, Radiohead and Robbie Williams.\n\nIn 2001, Hewlett and Albarn indicated that they had not received any feedback from Clint Eastwood himself over the song. Albarn expressed a desire to send the actor some of the band's merchandise as a mark of respect, and said, \"I'm sure Clint Eastwood would like [the song]. He's an intelligent man.\"\n\nAlex Needham of \"NME\" praised the Ed Case Refix, stating that it \"hauls [the track] down the dancefloor of Twice As Nice, where all the disparate elements fall into place and the jarring culture clash suddenly makes perfect sense. A little shift in perspective and, suddenly, you've got a west London Basement Jaxx, embodying a more interesting - and accurate - vision of England than anything Blur (Albarn's other project) have dared to attempt.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a member of the Florida Association of Museums, is ranked among the top art museums in the state of Florida, and is a Smithsonian Affiliate. Admission to the museum is free to the general public. On June 1, 2017, the Polk Museum of Art, a private community museum, entered an affiliation agreement with Florida Southern College in order to advance the mission of both entities and better serve the community.\n\nThe museum was originally established by the Junior Welfare League in 1966 and called Imperial Youth Museum. It was renamed Polk Public Museum in 1969 as part of its expanded focus on art, history, and science. The museum's current name, Polk Museum of Art, was adopted as part of its first building campaign in the 1980s. The building was designed by architect Ernie Straughn and was completed in 1988.\n\nThe Polk Museum of Art (PMoA) currently displays art from the Pre-Columbian era through the contemporary, featuring hundreds of works each year in a variety of exhibits that often revolve around a central theme. It boasts a permanent collection of over 2,500 works including student work, Pre-Columbian Art, Modern and Contemporary Art, Asian Art, African Art, European and American Decorative Arts, and the sculptures in its outdoor gardens. PMoA also dedicates much of its physical space to temporary exhibitions, including both local artwork and traveling exhibits, which provide diverse displays that include American folk art, modern masters, Japanese prints and textiles, African art, African American Art, a Moon Museum exhibit, and much more.\n\nThe Mission Statement of PMoA is that \"The Polk Museum of Art enhances the lives of our varied communities by bringing people and art together.\" Because of this, the museum invests heavily in its Education Department and educational programming for both children and adults. Some of these initiatives include tours of the museum, art camps for children and families, and classes and workshops on subjects such as photography, drawing, and painting. There is also a program called \"Meet Me at PMoA: Making Art Accessible to People with Dementia,\" where participants with dementia meet monthly to \"create and discuss art.\" \"Changing Lives Through Art\" is the museum's outreach program, which aims to help at-risk members of the community, including teenage mothers and children in homeless shelters.\n\nThe free public charter school, Lakeland Montessori Middle is on the second floor.\n\n\n"}

In parts of India, it is known as Kher or Khor. It is native to semi-desert regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Oman, Pakistan, west coastal India. It grows to a height of 5–12 metres (16-40'), with a trunk up to 30 cm (1') in diameter. \"Sudan\" is the source of the world's highest quality gum arabic, known locally as hashab gum in contrast to the related, but inferior, gum arabic from Red acacia or talah gum.\n\nThe tree is of great economic importance for the gum arabic it produces which is used as a food additive, in crafts, and as a cosmetic. The gum is drained from cuts in the bark, and an individual tree will yield 200 to 300 grams (7 to 10 oz). Eighty percent of the world's gum arabic is produced in Sudan.\nThe Chauhatan area of Barmer district in Rajasthan is also famous for gum production, this is called कुम्मत (Kummat) in local language there.\n\nNew foliage is very useful as forage. Leaves and pods of \"S. senegal\" are browsed by domestic and wild ruminants.\n\nDried seeds are used as food by humans.\n\nLike other legume species, \"S. senegal\" fixes nitrogen within \"Rhizobia\" or nitrogen-fixing bacteria living in root nodules. This nitrogen fixation enriches the poor soils where it is grown, allowing for the rotation of other crops in naturally nutrient-poor regions.\n\nIt has been reportedly used for its astringent properties, to treat bleeding, bronchitis, cough, diarrhea, dysentery, catarrh, gonorrhea, leprosy, typhoid fever and upper respiratory tract infections.\n\nRoots near the surface of the ground are quite useful in making all kinds of very strong ropes and cords. The tree bark is also used to make rope.\n\nThe wood of \"S. senegal\" can be used to make handles for tools, and parts for weaving looms. It is also valued as firewood and can be used to produce charcoal.\n\n\"S. senegal\" contains hentriacontane, a solid, long-chain alkane hydrocarbon. The leaf also contains the psychoactive alkaloid dimethyltryptamine.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2158445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158445", "title": "19-2000", "text": "19-2000\n\n\"19-2000\", sometimes written \"19/2000\", is a song from Gorillaz' self-titled debut album \"Gorillaz\". It was the second single from the album, released in June 2001. \"19-2000\" reached number six in the United Kingdom and number 34 on the US \"Billboard\" Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was particularly successful in New Zealand, where it reached number one for a week in September 2001.\n\nThe single peaked at number six in the United Kingdom and reached number one in New Zealand.\n\nThe single released was accompanied by a completely new version of the song, called the \"Soulchild Remix\", which was produced by music producers Damien Mendis and Stuart Bradbury. Mendis was asked to remix a track off the album in the hope that it would give it crossover potential, in the same way as the Ed Case remix of \"Clint Eastwood\" had. Mendis was given a copy of all their demos and finished tracks for the album, being told to \"pick [a song] that you can produce, remix or whatever into a hit single\". Mendis was unsure which track to choose, and only when he was told that Jamie Hewlett was already working on the video for \"19-2000\", did he make his decision. The remix appears to utilise the drums from \"Sing a Simple Song\" by Sly and the Family Stone. The remix is basically a faster, more upbeat version of the song, but with re-recorded vocals as opposed to the speeded-up vocals of \"Clint Eastwood: Ed Case Refix\". The remix appears as a bonus track on the original version of the album, as well as being the first track on \"G Sides\". From 2002, this version replaced the original version on radio stations. Another version of the song, entitled the \"Gorillaz on My Mind Remix\", features US rapper Redman, and appears on the soundtrack of \"Blade II\".\n\nThe Soulchild remix was featured in a wide variety of media, including the Channel 4 show \"100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows\" and a TV commercial for Ice Breakers, as well the title theme for the video game \"FIFA 2002\". Tina Weymouth and Miho Hatori contributed backing vocals to \"19-2000\", whilst Damon Albarn performed the vocals on the verses. The original version was featured on the licensed soundtrack of the 2001 Xbox launch title \"Project Gotham Racing\", Toonami's Midnight Run Special Edition, and the 2008 film \"Cloverfield\".\n\nThe video, directed by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland, is animated, both in 2-D and 3-D. It features Gorillaz riding in their Geep (as mentioned in the 2005 \"MTV Cribs\" episode, featuring the Gorillaz) along a twisted highway, encountering roller coaster style loops, a killer UFO, when Murdoc decides not to take an exit leading toward a church, and a giant moose. Murdoc tries to blow up the moose with a pair of missiles, but the moose sneezes right before impact, sending them back to the car, which explodes and skids along the highway on fire. The members of Gorillaz appear to have black ash all over them from the blast. In between these various encounters the Gorillaz pass and perform things in time with the rhythm—such as a field of nodding donkeys, or the light posts passing them at the beginning, and a couple of sections where the buggy does several versions of the wheelie (including side wheelies, otherwise known as Skiing) and even appears to break the sound barrier. There are two versions of this video, one to fit the original mix and one to fit the soulchild remix. The videos are almost identical, except for a few minor changes in order for the two songs to sync up with the video. On the motorway, there are signs to Amity, a reference to \"Jaws\", the Overlook Hotel, a reference to \"The Shining\", and Camp Crystal, a reference to \"Friday the 13th\". It was shown in the MTV Cribs tour of Kong Studios that the buggy actually survived the blast, and now sits in the Kong Studio's parking lot.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As of February 2016, he ranked second in international titles (18), behind only Lee Chang-ho (21). He is the fifth youngest (12 years 4 months) to become a professional Go player in South Korean history behind Cho Hun-hyun (9 years 7 months), Lee Chang-ho (11 years 1 months), Cho Hye-yeon (11 years 10 months) and Choi Cheol-han (12 years 2 months). His nickname is \"The Strong Stone\" (\"Ssen-dol\"). He was defeated by the computer program AlphaGo 1-4 in a series in March 2016. \n\nOn 19 November 2019, Lee announced his retirement from professional play, arguing that he could never be the top overall player of Go due to the increasing dominance of AI. Lee referred to them as being \"an entity that cannot be defeated\".\n\nLee was born in South Korea in 1983 and studied at the Korea Baduk Association. He ranks second in international titles (18), behind only Lee Chang-ho (21). Despite this, he describes his opening play as \"very weak\". In February 2013, Lee announced that he planned to retire within three years and move to the U.S. to promote Go. He plays on Tygem as \"gjopok\". He is known as 'Bigeumdo Boy' because he was born and grew up on Bigeumdo Island. \n\nHe is married to Kim Hyun-jin, and has a daughter, Lee Hye-rim.\n\nThis was a match between Lee Sedol and Hong Chang-sik during the 2003 KAT cup, played on 23 April 2003. This game is notable for Lee's use of a broken ladder formation.\n\nNormally playing out a broken ladder is a bad mistake, a pitfall associated with bad beginner play; the chasing stones are left appallingly weak. Between experts it should be decisive, leading to a lost game. Lee, playing black, defied the conventional wisdom, pushing development of the ladder to capture a large group of Hong's stones in the lower-right side of the board. Although Black could not capture the stones in the ladder, White ultimately resigned.\n\nStarting March 9, 2016, Lee played a five-game match, broadcast live, against the computer program AlphaGo, developed by a London-based artificial intelligence firm Google DeepMind, for a $1 million match prize. He said “I have heard that Google DeepMind’s AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger, but I am confident that I can win at least this time”. In an interview with Sohn Suk-hee of JTBC Newsroom on February 22, 2016, he showed confidence in his chances again, while saying that even beating AlphaGo by 4–1 may allow the Google DeepMind team to claim its \"de facto\" victory and the defeat of him, or even humanity. In this interview he pointed out the time rule in this match, which seems well-balanced so that both he and the AI would fairly undergo time pressure. In another interview at Yonhap News, Lee Se-dol said that he was confident of beating AlphaGo by a score of 5–0, at least 4–1 and accepted the challenge in only five minutes. He also stated \"Of course, there would have been many updates in the last four or five months, but that isn’t enough time to challenge me\".\n\nOn March 9, Lee played black and lost the first game by resignation. On March 10, he played white and lost the second game by resignation. On March 12, he played black and lost the third game as well. On March 13, he played white and won the fourth game, following an unexpected move at White 78 described as \"a brilliant \"tesuji\"\", and by Gu Li 9 dan as a \"divine move\" and completely unforeseen by him. \"GoGameGuru\" commented that this game was \"\"a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go\"\". Lee commented after the victory that he considered AlphaGo was strongest when playing white (second). For this reason, and because he thought winning a second time with black would be more valuable than winning with white, he requested that he play black in the final fifth game, which is considered more risky when following Chinese go rules. On March 15, he played black and lost the fifth game, to lose the Go series 1–4.\nAfter his fourth-match victory, Lee was overjoyed: \"I don't think I've ever felt so good after winning just one match. I remember when I said I will win all or lose just one game in the beginning. If this had really happened ― I won 3 rounds and lost this round ― it would have had a great bearing on my reputation. However, since I won after losing 3 games in a row, I am so happy. I will never exchange this win for anything in the world.\" He added: \"I, Lee Se-dol, lost, but mankind did not.\" After the last match, however, Lee was saddened: \"I failed. I feel sorry that the match is over and it ended like this. I wanted it to end well.\" He also confessed that \"As a professional Go player, I never want to play this kind of match again. I endured the match because I accepted it.\"\n\nLee Sedol turned pro in 1995 as 1 dan, and reached 9 dan in 2003.\n\nRanks #3 in total number of titles in Korea and #2 in international titles.\nAt Tygem Lee Sedol plays as \"LeeShiShi\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158490", "title": "Kevin Painter", "text": "Kevin Painter\n\nKevin Painter (born 12 July 1967 in Billericay, Essex) is an English professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation tournaments, where he is known as \"The Artist\". He is arguably most famous for finishing runner up to Phil Taylor in the 2004 PDC World Championship final, now widely credited as one of the greatest televised matches in the history of the game. He was also the winner of the Players Championship Finals in 2011.\n\nPainter started playing darts around the age of 17. His first County Appearance was against Staffordshire for Essex at the Runnymede Hall, Benfleet on Saturday 15 November as a Men's B Team player, where he won 2-0 in 16 and 21 darts, recording an average of 27.08 (81.24) Once an Essex county player, his first appearance on television was in the 1994 BDO World Championship, which was notable as the first BDO World Championship to follow the split in darts, where 16 players formed the World Darts Council (later Professional Darts Corporation) and their own world championship. Painter was defeated in the first round 3–2 by Kevin Kenny. During that year (1994) he also appeared on TV's \"Bullseye\" and won the pro's Bronze Bully for that year with a score of 380 (doubled up to £760 for charity). He reached the second round of the 1995 championship before falling 3–0 to Martin Adams, but success followed later in 1995 with a win in the inaugural England Open and in 1997 he won the prestigious British Open. Two more appearances in the second round of the BDO World Championship followed and in the 2000 championship he reached his first televised quarter-final, but lost 5–2 to the eventual champion Ted Hankey.\n\nThe new millennium marked more success for Painter with victory in the Swedish Open. Only a month earlier he had made his debut in a PDC event – the 2000 World Grand Prix where he reached the second round, but was defeated 3–2 by Taylor. Painter however did not become a member of the Professional Dart Players Association, the organisation that allows players to play in all PDC events, and therefore remained a BDO player. In what would be his final appearance in the event, Painter once again reached the quarter-finals in the 2001 BDO World Championship before losing 5–2 to Andy Fordham. Painter entered another PDC event, the 2001 World Matchplay, but lost in the first round before returning again in the 2001 World Grand Prix, where in a major shock he defeated Taylor in the first round. Taylor had never before been defeated in this event and had not lost on television for two years prior to this loss. This was also the first time that Taylor had been defeated in the first round of a televised PDC event. Painter reached the quarter-finals before losing 6–1 to Dennis Smith. Back in the BDO he made his best performance in the 2001 Winmau World Masters, reaching the quarter-finals and repeated that placing in the 2001 Zuiderduin Masters, in what was his last BDO event.\n\nPainter made his debut in the PDC World Championship in the 2002 event but lost in the first round to Ronnie Baxter. Despite a victory in the 2002 Bob Anderson Classic, he failed to make any real headway in the televised PDC events until he reached his first world championship semi-final in the 2003 PDC World Championship, where he lost 6–4 to eventual champion John Part.\n\nPainter's finest hour came in the 2004 World Championship. As the 10th seed, he began his campaign by beating Paul Williams before he defeated 7th seed Baxter in the fourth round. He then beat Mark Dudbridge before a whitewash of former world champion Bob Anderson followed later on in the semi-finals. Painter then met top seed Taylor in the final. What followed was the longest televised darts match ever and for a time the most watched PDC darts match (820,000 viewers) until the 2007 final. Despite Painter leading 4–1 at one point, the match went to 6–6 in sets and 5–5 in legs in the final set, so a sudden-death leg was needed to decide a winner. Taylor won it and became the champion, but Painter, who had a three-dart out-shot to win the championship at 2–1 and 3–2 in the final set, while also leaving himself double 16 at 4–3 in the final set without ever getting a dart at it, gained fame for his participation in such an epic final.\n\nThe following year was a strong one for Painter where he reached the quarter-finals in the UK Open and the semi-finals in the Las Vegas Desert Classic, his best performance in these tournaments to date. He reached the quarter-finals of the 2005 Las Vegas Desert Classic and the 2005 World Championship despite falling victim to a leg injury which damaged his form and kept him out of many tournaments.\n\nPainter's form dropped substantially in 2006. Despite opening strongly with a victory in the North West UK Open final and a second successive appearance in the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Championship, his form began to stagnate around the middle of the year. Painter suffered first or early round defeats in most of the major tournaments and his ranking had dropped to 18 by the beginning of 2007. This was exacerbated by a defeat in the first round of that year's World Championship to his former practice partner Colin Osborne.\n\nThe first half of 2007 saw the early round defeats in televised majors continue, though many of them were to Taylor and then-World Champion Raymond van Barneveld. Painter suffered another first round loss in the 2007 World Grand Prix, but this would prove to be the turning point. Sky Sports pundit and friend Rod Harrington warned that Painter could \"slip into anonymity\" if he did not recover his form. Painter attributed the \"perception that he was finished\" to a renewed determination and subsequent rise in form.\n\nNovember 2007 saw a strong return to form for Painter, where he reached the quarter-finals of the first Grand Slam of Darts despite being entered as a wild card. The 2008 World Championship proved to be a monumental success for Painter, where he was responsible for knocking out defending champion Raymond van Barneveld in the last 16. Painter was knocked out in the semi-finals by eventual champion Part, his best performance since when he was the runner-up in 2004. Painter considers the win over van Barneveld as the greatest of his career.\n\nPainter's results in the televised majors in 2008 were not as might have been expected from the World Championship – he was once again defeated by Osborne in the third round of the UK Open and lost in the first round of the Las Vegas Desert Classic against the eventual champion Taylor. Painter averaged 104 (the third highest average of the tournament) and did not miss a double in the match, but was still defeated 6–4. His poor record at the World Matchplay continued as he suffered a first round loss in the 2008 event to Tony Eccles. He lost in a deciding leg to Colin Lloyd in the second round of the World Grand Prix (having missed three darts to win the match) and finished bottom of his group in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. However, his success in non-televised events was considerably better including an appearance in the Bristol Players Championship final – losing 3–2 to Dennis Priestley. This was his first PDC final since September 2006.\n\nPainter entered the 2009 PDC World Championship as the number 17 seed. He defeated Matt Clark in the first round, winning in a sudden-death leg to become the first seeded player to progress to the second round, where he beat Carlos Rodríguez. However, in the third round he lost 4–1 to eventual champion Taylor. In the inaugural Players Championship Finals at the end of January, Painter looked to be heading for another first round exit as he went 5–2 down to Alex Roy, but he won four consecutive legs to progress to the second round, where he met second seed James Wade. This match also went to a deciding leg; Painter missed one dart at the bullseye and Wade took his chance to go through at Painter's expense. However, this performance saw Painter re-establish his place in the top 16 of the rankings, and his good form in floor events from 2008 continued – he reached two semi-finals on the PDC Pro Tour, notably in Gladbeck, Germany, where on 1 March he led Taylor 5–4 before losing 6–5.\n\nIn June 2009, Painter reached the semi-finals of the UK Open, his best ever performance in the tournament. After dispatching Dennis Priestley 9–3 and Alan Tabern 10–8, Painter eventually lost 10–7 to Colin Osborne. His World Matchplay woes continued with a 13–3 defeat to Taylor in the second round of the 2009 event, though he reached the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix and the Grand Slam of Darts, in the latter topping the 'group of death' that included Raymond van Barneveld and John Part. Another third round exit followed in the 2010 World Championship, 4–1 to van Barneveld this time.\n\nPainter's first televised appearance in 2010 was a third round defeat at the UK Open, where he was on the end of a 9–0 whitewash by Taylor, who recorded the current world record average at 118.66. But success was to follow in the 2010 World Matchplay; after making a remarkable comeback to come from 8–2 down in defeating Essex rival Colin Lloyd 11–9 in the first round, he overcame Mark Walsh 14–12 to reach the quarter-finals of the World Matchplay at the tenth time of asking. Once again however, eternal rival Taylor brought his run to an end in the semi-finals.\n\nInitially Painter suffered an indifferent 2011. At the 2011 PDC World Championship, he was defeated soundly in the first round by Brendan Dolan. At the 2011 World Matchplay, Painter revealed that he had received laser eye surgery before the tournament to improve his game, he also stated that he had hit a nine dart finish after 10 minutes of practise with his improved vision. However, in the opening night of the tournament, he led reigning world champion Adrian Lewis for most of the match, but missed six doubles that would have won him the match, and subsequently lost by 14 legs to 12.\n\nAt the Players Championship Finals in December 2011, Painter beat Colin Osborne, Gary Anderson, Mervyn King, and Scott Rand to reach his first major final since the World Championship in 2004. The victory against Rand saw him recover from 9–6 down in the best-of-19 leg match and survive two match darts in the seventeenth leg. Painter then beat Mark Webster 13–9 in the final to win his first televised major tournament. This victory returned him to the top 10 in the PDC Order of Merit for the first time since 2006. At the 2012 PDC World Championship, Painter defeated Arron Monk and Mark Walsh before losing once again to John Part by four sets to two.\n\nPainter's Players Championship victory saw him gain a PDC wildcard into the Premier League Darts for the first time. He won his first game with an 8–6 win over Gary Anderson, despite averaging 82.67. Painter also had wins over Simon Whitlock, Andy Hamilton, and Adrian Lewis, but finished 7th in the 8 man league. At the World Matchplay, Painter suffered a 6–10 defeat to Steve Beaton in the first round. In October, Painter defeated Kim Huybrechts 2–0 in sets in the first round of the World Grand Prix without his opponent picking up a single leg, but then lost to Justin Pipe 2–3 in the last 16. Painter won two of his three Group C games at the Grand Slam of Darts to finish second in the table and qualify for the knockout stage, where he faced Mervyn King. From 2–2, Painter surged away by taking five straight legs and closed out the match 10–5, but then missed 30 of his 42 attempts at a double in the quarter-finals against Dean Winstanley as he lost 12–16. Painter finished 30th on the ProTour Order of Merit, just inside the top 32 who qualified for the Players Championship Finals. He began the defence of his 2011 title with a first round meeting against Michael van Gerwen, who had won eight tournaments this year, and lost 3–6.\n\nAt the 2013 World Championship, Painter lost in the last 16 to Adrian Lewis 4–2. He produced a superb fightback from 7–3 down in the fourth round of the UK Open to beat Gary Anderson 9–7. At 5–0 down to Adrian Lewis in the next round, Painter threatened another amazing comeback as at one point he trailed only 4–6, but he would ultimately lose 9–4. He was knocked out in the second round of the European Championship, World Matchplay and World Grand Prix.\nIn October, Painter made it through to his first PDC ranking final since his major success almost two years ago at the 12th Players Championship of the season. From the last 16 onwards he defeated Robert Thornton, Wes Newton and Michael Smith, but was whitewashed 6–0 by Kim Huybrechts in the final.\n\nPainter advanced to the third round of the 2014 World Championship without dropping a set but then hit just 19% of his doubles against Simon Whitlock to lose 4–0.\nAt the UK Open he enjoyed comfortable wins over Richie Burnett, Andrew Gilding and Dean Winstanley and led Mervyn King 2–0 in the early stages of their quarter-final, before his form dropped to lose 10–6. His second major quarter-final of the year came at the World Grand Prix which he reached by coming back from 2–0 down in sets against Adrian Lewis to win 3–2. He again fell 2–0 down this time against Gary Anderson, but rallied to pull a setback and then took out a 152 finish with Anderson waiting on 36 for the match to draw level at 2–2. However, Painter would lose the deciding set to fall short of reaching his first semi-final in the event, this being his fifth last eight defeat.\n\nPainter built a 3–1 set advantage over Spanish qualifier Cristo Reyes in the second round of the 2015 World Championship, but lost three sets in a row without getting a match dart to be eliminated 4–3. He suffered a 9–0 whitewash to Andrew Gilding in the third round of the UK Open. Painter missed out on playing in the World Matchplay this year since he switched to the PDC in 2001. He failed to qualify for the rest of the majors on the PDC calendar in 2015, but remained in the top 32 on the Order of Merit to play in the 2016 World Championship.\n\nIn the second round of the 2016 World Championship, Painter missed four darts to lead Phil Taylor 2–1 and went on to be defeated 4–1.\n2016 proved to be the first year since Painter's switch to the PDC that he did not reach the quarter-finals of any event. Painter dropped out of the top 32 in the world rankings during the year and qualified for two other major events, the UK Open (lost 6–4 to Dean Winstanley in the second round) and the Players Championship Finals (lost 6–4 to Dave Chisnall in the first round).\n\nPainter qualified for the 2017 World Championship through the Pro Tour Order of Merit when Kyle Anderson was forced to withdraw from the event due to being unable to get a UK Visa. He won the last six legs of his first round encounter with Jamie Caven to defeat him 3–1. He missed a number of doubles in his second round match with Phil Taylor, including three to win the third set, and was defeated 4–0.\n\nPainter qualified via the Pro Tour Order of Merit for the 2018 World Championship, but lost in the first round to Mensur Suljović 3-0.\n\nIn 2018 he did not earn enough money to qualify for another major tournament. Since he lost his tourcard in 2019 he is playing on the Challenge Tour.\n\nPainter lives in Rugby, Warwickshire. He previously lived with his long-term partner, Janine Gough, and their daughter, Madison Elise Painter (born 2005), until his separation from Gough in 2016. Gough is herself a former darts player from Swansea, and she won the Girls' World Masters in 1999 and 2000. Kevin Painter was a builder before turning professional. He spends his training sessions with Matthew Edgar, a PDC darts player. He is also a season ticket and share holder of Ipswich Town. He often plays wearing a blue shirt in reference to his favourite team.\n\nIn 2012, Painter, together with the seven other players who competed in the Premier League recorded a charity single with Chas Hodges and his band called 'Got My Tickets For The Darts' which was written by Chas. It was released on 18 May, the night after the play-offs at the O2 in London, where it was premiered. Proceeds from the single will be donated to the Haven House Children's Hospice.\n\nPainter has also been featured in numerous darts videogames, including \"PDC World Championship Darts 2008\", \"2009\" and \"PDC World Championship Darts Pro Tour\".\n\nPainter is probably also famous for a notorious rivalry with Taylor, perhaps stemming from his shock victory over Taylor in the 2001 World Grand Prix, and loss in the 2004 World Championship final. He has had many run-ins with Taylor. In the 2005 World Championship quarter-final against Taylor, Painter often tried to check out by hitting the bullseye, but failed many times. Taylor won the last leg of the match by deliberately leaving 50, then checking out on the bull, which Painter took as a taunt and argued viciously with Taylor for a few minutes after the match.\n\nIn April 2008, Painter was involved in another incident at the Holland Masters, a non-televised tournament. In a quarter-final match with Taylor's protégé, Adrian Lewis, an argument between the two took place in the deciding set. They were both disqualified from the tournament. In July, the Darts Regulation Authority decided upon an appropriate punishment; Painter was fined £200 and banned for three months with two months suspended while Lewis was fined £400 with a six-month ban, four months suspended.\n\n\n\nBDO\n\nPDC\n\n"}

He was commandant of the convict settlement at Norfolk Island for a period in 1839. He later served in New Zealand and British India. \n\nBorn on 19 May 1791 in Gibraltar, Bunbury was educated in England. He joined the 90th Regiment in 1807 and fought in the Peninsular War during which he was wounded. After the war, he considered becoming an artist, spending time in Paris. In 1822, he joined the 80th Regiment, based in Malta. In 1825, he transferred to the 85th Regiment of Foot for a period of service in Spain before returning to the 80th Regiment, with which he later served in England. In 1837, Bunbury was sent to Australia and in due course the Governor of New South Wales, George Gipps, ordered him take command of the garrison and convict settlement at Norfolk Island.\n\nHe was commandant at Norfolk Island from April to July 1839. As commandant, he was confident in his ability to manage the hardened convicts under his command. He wrote that he could not understand why \"a villain who has been guilty of every enormity, should feel shame at having his back scratched with the cat-o-nine-tails when he felt none for his atrocious crimes.\" He also claimed that \"if a man is too sick to work he is too sick to eat\" and claimed that the queue at the hospital was halved. Although his punishments were harsh, he replaced hand hoeing with ploughs, rewarded good behaviour with improved jobs and gave older convicts lighter work. He earned the ire of the soldiers on the island by ordering the destruction of huts built on the small gardens they kept for their own use and for trafficking with the convicts. The soldiers mutinied, a warship was sent to restore peace and Bunbury was recalled in July 1839.\n\nIn 1840, after William Hobson, Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, suffered a stroke, Bunbury was sent by Gipps to New Zealand with instructions to take over as Lieutenant-Governor if Hobson was incapacitated, but he had recovered. Bunbury took the Treaty of Waitangi to the South Island on HMS \"Herald\" and took possession of the island. He was made a magistrate in 1841 and acted as Deputy Governor in January 1844. Later in 1844 he was sent to India. While in transit to Calcutta, his ship was wrecked on the Andaman Islands. For his leadership of the 600 odd survivors until they were rescued, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He later served in the First Anglo-Sikh War and was present at most of the major battles of the campaign in India, including the Battle of Sobraon.\n\nBunbury retired from the British Army on 31 December 1849 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and returned to England, marrying soon after his arrival in the country. He wrote his memoirs which were published in 1861. He died early the following year.\n\n"}

(Margam is believed to have played a significant role in the early transmission of the work of St. Bernard of Clairvaux). At the dissolution of the monasteries, it came into the possession of the Mansel family who were eventually succeeded by their descendants in the female line, the Talbot family, a cadet branch of the family of the Earls of Shrewsbury.\n\nThe parish church continued to operate from the nave of Margam Abbey, as it still does. Margam Castle grounds contain the ruins of the Chapter House and major 17th century and 18th century monuments. The Stones Museum contains important evidence for the advent of early Christianity in the area.\n\nWith the coming of the industrial revolution, the parish of Margam became important for two reasons. First, it had a good harbour which was ultimately developed into Port Talbot, named in honour of the squires of Margam. Second, it had coal deposits, and coal mining in the parish took off in the late 18th century. The combination of local fuel and good transport links from the harbour made Margam an important part of the industrial landscape of the South Wales Coalfield.\n\nAt first, the coal workers lived away from the village of Margam itself, notably in a settlement at Taibach. However, eventually, the whole of the parish was submerged by the community of industrial workers. Margam then assumed its modern form as a suburb of Port Talbot.\n\nNot included in the urbanisation and industrialisation of Margam, however, were the grounds of Margam Abbey, which were incorporated by the Talbot family into the grounds of their nearby 19th century mansion, Margam Castle (badly damaged by fire in the late 20th century but now in process of restoration). The Talbot family had previously, in the 18th century constructed at Margam the longest orangery in Europe, which still stands. All the land was sold out of the Talbot family in the mid 20th century but it has been preserved as Margam Country Park, an estate of some owned and administered by the local council which is a major local attraction. The collection of early Christian Celtic crosses and inscribed stones which the Talbot family had collected from the locality, were moved in 1932 into the nearby Church Schoolroom, to become the Margam Stones Museum, now managed by Cadw.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Margam became the site of an important British Steel plc works.\n\nThe electoral ward and community of Margam is related to the district of Margam. The Margam ward elects a county councillor to Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council. It includes areas such as Port Talbot Steelworks, Eglwys Nunydd, Margam Country Park, the Margam Suburb, Port Talbot Docks and Margam Sands beach. Margam falls within the parliamentary constituency of Aberavon.\n\nIn the 2017 local council elections, the results were:\nCouncillor Jones became leader of Neath Port Talbot Council following the election.\n\nIn the 2012 local council elections, the electorate turnout for Margam was 38.10%. The results were:\n\n\n\n"}

It was released as the third single from the album in October 2001. It peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. The song features a horn section loop sampled from \"Modesty Blaise\", a piece by British jazz musician John Dankworth. Rapper Del tha Funkee Homosapien is the only artist to provide vocals for the song.\n\nThe music video for \"Rock the House\" was directed by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland. The inspiration for the video is said to have come from Hewlett's angst at the time, as the band was going through the process of being sued by another band named Doppelgangerz, who claimed that Gorillaz was a stolen idea. It starts with a shot of the gate of Kong Studios. The camera then follows Noodle on a tricycle through the hallways of the building. It leads past a door to a room where Gorillaz are performing. A white mist appears among them and Russel passes out. Then the floor has turned into the ghost of Del, who rises up and throws the Gorillaz to the ground. Del is outfitted with protective gear including a helmet. In \"Rise of the Ogre\" it explains he is dressed as Mr. Freedom. Del takes a few steps when from behind him a series of spring-loaded guns shoot billiard balls at him, but he diverts them with his glove. A series of inflatable female gorillas appear and start to do cheerleading. 2-D is dodging the balls being shot at him by doing dance moves, but then he is hit by a few balls and knocked out. Murdoc then begins to divert the balls with a padded jockstrap he is wearing, hitting them away with his pelvic thrusts. He is successful a dozen times until a ball ricochets off the padded wall and hits his unprotected buttocks. The ball ricochets and hits Russel in the head, waking him up and making Del disappear. Russel looks around, noticing 2-D laying on the floor, Murdoc is standing bowlegged, and Noodle smiling and holding her guitar. The final shot is simply the introduction, but reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \"Gorillaz: Rise of the Ogre\", 2-D claims to have \"played some divvy panpipes\" for \"Rock the House\" during a track-by-track of the \"Gorillaz\" album. Murdoc is stunned by this and repeats his disbelief briefly during the section on the video. Though the track was selected for a single and received generally good reactions, \"Rise of the Ogre\" claims that Gorillaz were never particularly satisfied with \"Rock the House\", with Murdoc expressing his opinions by claiming he \"won this song in a raffle\" and 2-D thinking that the track should not have made it on the album at all. For the radio edit of the song, the line which features the words \"Shake your ass-crack\" is cut. Instead, the edit features the orchestral type sound, which features after the trumpet riff at the start of the song, so that the last two words are not heard.\n\n"}

{"id": "2158535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158535", "title": "Red Krayola", "text": "Red Krayola\n\nThe Red Krayola (formerly the Red Crayola) is an American underground rock band from Houston, Texas, formed in 1966 by the original trio of singer/guitarist Mayo Thompson, drummer Frederick Barthelme, and bassist Steve Cunningham.\n\nThe group formed as part of the same 1960s Texas psychedelic scene in which the Thirteenth Floor Elevators formed. While studying art at the University of St. Thomas, the members signed with independent label International Artists. Their confrontational, experimental approach employed noise and \"free-form freak-outs\", presaging the development of industrial rock and winning them a small cult following.\n\nThe Red Crayola disbanded in the late 1960s, but were resurrected in the late 1970s when Thompson moved to England and found favor in the post-punk scene. Thompson continued using the name, in its legally altered spelling, for his musical projects since, recording on European labels such as Rough Trade and Recommended. In the mid-1990s, Thompson returned to the United States, signing with Drag City and releasing further albums.\n\nIn 1966, the band signed to International Artists, home label to fellow psych-rockers The 13th Floor Elevators, which was run by Lelan Rogers (brother of country musician Kenny Rogers). In 1967, the label released the psychedelic album \"Parable of Arable Land\", featuring six songs by the original three members interwoven with a cacophony generated by approximately 50 anonymous followers known as \"The Familiar Ugly\", who appear on a number of noise tracks called \"Free-Form Freak-Outs\". 13th Floor Elevators frontman Roky Erickson also makes guest appearances on \"Hurricane Fighter Plane\" (playing organ) and \"Transparent Radiation\" (on harmonica). The album's title track was a tape loop of electronic sounds with musical improvisations layered on top of it; a sound that foreshadowed the Red Krayola's second recording.\n\nThe album \"Coconut Hotel\" was recorded in 1967 but rejected by International Artists for its lack of commercial potential because of its complete departure from the full-sounding guitar/bass/drums/vocals rock sound of the Red Krayola's first album. \"Coconut Hotel\" featured such self-described tracks as \"Organ Buildup\", \"Free Guitar\" and a series of atonal \"One-Second Pieces\" for piano, trumpet and percussion. The album did not see release until 1995. During this period, the band performed a concert in Berkeley, California, where they attached a contact microphone to a sheet of aluminium foil that was set under a block of melting ice; this performance is captured on \"Live 1967\". The Red Krayola also performed with guitarist John Fahey and recorded an entire studio album of music in collaboration with him, but label head Lelan Rogers demanded possession of the tapes, and recorded documentation of those sessions has been missing ever since.\n\nThe band's second album to see release (and the first to be released with the new \"Krayola\" spelling) was 1968's \"God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It\". \"God Bless\" presented a middle ground between \"Parable of Arable Land\" and \"Coconut Hotel\", having veered away from the cacophonous psychedelic approach of their first album, but performing short, minimalist songs on electric guitar, bass and drums (interspersed with occasional a cappella harmonies and piano interludes) to achieve some surprisingly melodic results and even more surprisingly off-kilter lyrics. Hints of the as yet unheard music on \"Coconut Hotel\" also revealed themselves (the track \"Listen to This\" is a one-second piece with spoken introduction, and \"Free Piece\" sounds like an outtake from \"Coconut Hotel\"). The album was not as well received as the band's first release and the Red Krayola's original lineup disbanded.\n\nIn 1969, Thompson recorded a solo album called \"Corky's Debt to His Father\" for a small label called Texas Revolution. The album, which has come to be regarded by many as the unheralded jewel of the Krayola catalogue, is devoid of Thompson's usual avant-garde indulgences, and consists instead of ten lyrically dense but warm-hearted pop songs, in various styles – Dylan-inspired blues-rock, Tex-Mex pop-rock with psychedelic touches, and early country rock not dissimilar to the contemporary work of Gram Parsons and the Flying Burrito Brothers. Thompson was backed by studio musicians on the album and none of his usual Krayola (or 13th Floor Elevators) cohorts appear.\n\nMayo Thompson continued to make music, both under his own name and as The Red Crayola (reverting to the original name for Europe). He teamed up with American drummer Jesse Chamberlain and recorded the single \"Wives in Orbit\" and the album \"Soldier Talk\", both of which could be seen as musical responses to punk rock. Radar Records reissued \"Parable of Arable Land\" in 1978 in the UK, which came with a flexi-disc, on which was an up-tempo version of Hurricane Fighter Plane recorded in July 1978, with an apparent punk rock influence as well. His collaborations in the 1970s and 1980s read like a roll-call of the avant-garde and experimental artists and musicians of the era. The Red Crayola teamed up with the British-American conceptual art collective Art & Language, whom Thompson described as \"the baddest bastards on the block\", for three LPs: 1976's \"Corrected Slogans\", 1981's \"Kangaroo?\" (also featuring The Raincoats' Gina Birch, Lora Logic and Swell Maps' Epic Soundtracks) and 1983's \"Black Snakes\". Thompson joined Pere Ubu for a period in the early 1980s, performing on their albums \"The Art of Walking\" and \"Song of the Bailing Man\", and provided soundtrack music for Derek Jarman. Throughout this time he was prolific as a producer for many other seminal experimental and alternative rock acts, including The Fall (1980's \"Grotesque (After the Gramme)\"), The Raincoats, Scritti Politti, Blue Orchids, Cabaret Voltaire, Stiff Little Fingers, Kleenex/LiLiPUT, The Chills and Primal Scream.\n\nThe 1990s found The Red Krayola with a new audience, who came to the group via musicians associated with Chicago's post-rock scene and in particular the Drag City label, who had joined the band's ever-shifting line-up for a number of releases including the LPs \"The Red Krayola\" (1994), \"Hazel\" (1996), and \"Fingerpainting\" (1999). These were, among others, Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs of Gastr del Sol, the post-conceptual visual artist Stephen Prina, German painter Albert Oehlen, George Hurley (formerly of Minutemen and Firehose), Tom Watson of Slovenly, Sandy Yang, Elisa Randazzo and John McEntire of Tortoise. In 2006, the group issued an album, \"Introduction\", and an EP, \"Red Gold\".\n\nIn 1995, Drag City released 1967's \"Coconut Hotel\" LP and in 1998 issued \"The Red Krayola Live 1967\" with material from the Angry Arts Festival and Berkeley Folk Music Festival including their live collaboration with John Fahey.\n\nIn 2007, Drag City released \"Sighs Trapped by Liars\", another collaboration of Red Krayola with Art & Language, followed in 2010 with another, \"Five American Portraits\", which consists of musical portraits of Wile E. Coyote, President George W Bush, President Jimmy Carter, John Wayne, and Ad Reinhardt, with vocals by Gina Birch. In 2016 came \"Baby and Child Care\", recorded in 1984.\n\nPere Ubu covered \"Horses,\" a track from Mayo Thompson's solo album Corky's Debt to His Father, on 1980s The Art of Walking, while Thompson was a member.\n\nHouston, Texas hardcore punk band Really Red recorded a cover of \"War Sucks\" for their 1984 \"Rest in Pain\" LP and followed it with a soundscape piece entitled \"Just the Facts Ma'am\", which is an obvious tribute to the free-form freakouts on \"Parable of Arable Land\".\n\nBritish space rock group Spacemen 3 recorded a version of \"Transparent Radiation\" from the Red Krayola's \"Parable of Arable Land\", and the same album's lead track \"Hurricane Fighter Plane\" was covered by Nik Turner's post-Hawkwind outfit Inner City Unit, UK Goth rock legends Alien Sex Fiend in 1986 and by Scottish act Future Pilot AKA in 1996, as well as by ultra-violent punkrockers The Dwarves (who were originally a psychedelic garage band). Also covering \"Hurricane Fighter Plane\" was New Zealand post-punk band The Pin Group, led by future solo performer Roy Montgomery. Boston-based indie outfit Galaxie 500 covered \"Victory Garden\" from the Red Krayola's second album on their own second album \"On Fire\". In April 2009, Spectrum, fronted by ex-Spacemen 3 frontman Peter Kember, released an EP named for and headlined by a cover of \"War Sucks\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse developed the first rotating bolt firearm, the \"Dreyse needle gun\", in 1836.

The concept has been implemented on most firearms chambered for high powered cartridges since the 20th century.\n\nFerdinand Ritter von Mannlicher, who had earlier developed a non-rotating bolt straight-pull rifle, developed the Steyr-Mannlicher M1895, a straight-pull rifle with a rotating bolt, which was issued to the Austro-Hungarian Army. Mannlicher then developed the M1893 auto rifle which had a screw delayed bolt and later the Mannlicher M1900 operated by a gas piston. This was an inspiration for later gas operated, semi-automatic and selective fire firearms (such as the M1, M14, M16, the L85A1/A2 and the AK-47/74) in which the bolt, upon contact with the breech, rotates and locks into place, the lugs on the bolt locking into the breech or barrel extension.\n\nUpon closing, the bolt goes forward into barrel extension or locking recesses in the receiver, and then rotates; at this point it is locked in place. The bolt remains locked until the action is cycled, either manually by the operator, or mechanically by delayed blowback, recoil operation or gas operation which then rotates the bolt and unlocks it from the breech so that it can be withdrawn in order to extract and eject the spent casing, and the next round can be chambered. In gas operation, the gas port, which meters a portion of the combustion gases into the action in order to cycle the weapon, is typically located either midway down the barrel or near the muzzle of the weapon. In this way it functions as a delay, ensuring that the bolt remains locked until chamber pressure has subsided to a safe level.\n\nRotating bolts are found in delayed blowback, gas-operated, recoil-operated, bolt action, lever-action and pump-action weapon designs. Another form of delayed blowback which the bolt head rotates as the firing pin strikes locking the chamber until the gas pressure reaches a safe level to extract. As the firing pin retracts, the bolt head turns anti-clockwise unlocking the breech.\n\n\n\n"}

The monument commemorates the Battle of Bennington during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIn that battle, on August 16, 1777, Brigadier General John Stark and 1,400 New Hampshire men, aided by Colonels Warner and Herrick of Vermont, Simonds of Massachusetts, and Moses Nichols of New Hampshire, defeated two detachments of General John Burgoyne's British army, who were seeking to capture a store of weapons and food maintained where the monument now stands. While the battle is termed the Battle of Bennington, it actually occurred about away, in Walloomsac, New York; the Bennington Battlefield, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, is entirely within the state of New York.\n\nIn 1877 a local historical society began to plan a monument for the battle's centenary, and considered many designs. One which called for a slender stone column only tall was showcased during the battle's centennial celebration, which was attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The committee eventually accepted J. Phillip Rinn's design with some changes. The monument's cornerstone was laid in 1887, and it was completed in November 1889 at a total cost of $112,000 (including the site). It is constructed of Sandy Hill Dolomite from present day Hudson Falls, New York, a blue-gray magnesian limestone containing numerous fossils. Dedication ceremonies were delayed until 1891, when President Benjamin Harrison attended the ceremonies and held a reception at the nearby Walloomsac Inn. Today the Bennington Battle Monument is a Vermont State Historic Site.\n\nFrom its observatory level at , which can be reached by elevator (but not the stairs, which are closed), one can see Vermont along with the other U.S. states of Massachusetts and New York. A kettle captured from General Burgoyne's camp at Saratoga is visible in the monument along with a diorama of the second engagement, and information on how the monument was built. Statues of John Stark (\"Live free or die\"), Seth Warner, and other notables ornament the grounds.\n\nThe monument, while from the relevant battlefield, is located very close to what was once the site of the Catamount Tavern, where Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys planned the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158585", "title": "The Final Days", "text": "The Final Days\n\nThe Final Days is a 1976 non-fiction book written by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein about the Watergate scandal. A follow up to their 1974 book \"All the President's Men\", \"The Final Days\" concerns itself with the final months of the Presidency of Richard Nixon including battles over the Nixon White House tapes and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon.\n\nNot long after the resignation of Richard Nixon in August 1974, Woodward and Bernstein took a leave of absence from \"The Washington Post\" in order to begin work on the book. They originally intended to cover just the last hundred days of the Nixon presidency but then expanded it further back. They hired two research assistants, Scott Armstrong and Al Kamen, and among them they interviewed 394 people involved in the tale. People were anxious to talk in an effort to get their (sometimes self-serving) perspective on the events included in the narrative, and almost all of the sources were promised anonymity in return. In this way, Woodward and Bernstein constructed a fly on the wall type narrative of the events in question.\n\nWhile the book was being written, there were some intimations that it was going to be a \"blockbuster\" in terms of content, but Woodward demurred, saying instead that it would be \"a book of a hundred small surprises.\"\n\nAccording to Jon Marshall's 2011 retrospective look at Watergate and the press, although Bernstein got co-equal credit on the cover, he in fact did relatively few interviews and not only less of the writing than Woodward, but also less than either Armstrong or Kamen. (It could also be noted that Woodward wrote the foreword to Marshall's book.)\n\nAs noted in the book's foreword, all the information and scenarios depicted were taken from interviews with 394 people who were involved. The content of the interviews was considered on the record, but the identity of the sources remained confidential. Every detail was thoroughly checked, and any information that could not be confirmed by two separate accounts was left out of the book.\n\nIn an example of the book's approach, J. Fred Buzhardt co-operated with Woodward and Bernstein during the research for the book, by sitting for eight \"extensive\" interviews. One person was interviewed as many as 17 times.\n\nRelease of the book was preceded by the publishing of excerpts in \"Newsweek\" magazine, which included a number of the authors' more vivid narrations. (At the time, \"Newsweek\" was owned by The Washington Post Company.) At the same time, revelations from these excerpts appeared in many newspaper stories.\n\nTwo revelations that caught the most attention regarded Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. One was the disparaging comments about Nixon that Kissinger supposedly made to his staff, such as a reference to \"our meatball President.\" The other, which received even more attention, was a memorable August 7, night-before-resignation-announcement scene with the president, in which a sobbing Nixon asked Kissinger to kneel and pray with him in the Lincoln Sitting Room, with Nixon ending up curled on the floor, beating the carpet with his fist whilst bemoaning his fate. The sensational nature of some of the excerpts brought significant criticism. Other items revealed by the excerpts included Nixon's deteriorating mental state, fears among his sons-in-law that he posed a possible danger to himself, Nixon's strong strain of anti-Semitism, and that the president and First Lady Pat Nixon were estranged and had been for some time.\n\nThe promotion was effective: this issue of \"Newsweek\" became the fastest selling one in the magazine's history. The debate over these particular incidents colored much of the subsequent reaction to the book.\n\nThe book contains two parts, with twenty chapters. The first carries on from where \"All the President's Men\" leaves off, in particular from April 30, 1973, when John Dean, the White House counsel, was fired, and brings the narrative through developments of later in 1973 and then up to late July 1974. Part II consists of a day-by-day account of the title-referenced final days, beginning with \"Wednesday, July 24\" and continuing through \"Friday, August 9\".\n\nThere is also a Cast of Characters at the beginning, starting at Robert Abplanalp and finishing with Ronald L. Ziegler, and a Chronology at the end, running from November 5, 1968 through August 9, 1974. Both are intended to help the reader keep the complex chain of events and people in mind.\n\nAs published by Simon & Schuster, the book contained some photographic illustrations and cost $10.95. After it became the fastest selling book in the publisher's history, the price was raised to $11.95, supposedly to defray paper costs and, in the publisher's words, as part of \"maintaining priority press time so that [it] can get on press before other books.\"\n\nReviews of the book focused both on the disclosures within it and the methods by which it was written. Regarding the first, the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the book was \"Fascinating, macabre, mordant, melancholy, frightening...\" \"Newsweek\", which ran the excerpts, described it as \"An extraordinary work of reportage on the epic political story of our time.\"\n\nThe book as a whole gave a more balanced, at times sympathetic, portrait of Nixon. \"The New York Times\" daily review by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said that the book was \"Unprecedented...[Nixon] emerges from the book as a tragic figure weathering a catastrophic ordeal (of his own making, to be sure, but that is the nature of truly tragic ordeals), and weathering it with considerable courage and dignity.\" This fuller depiction did much to ameliorate the initial denunciations of the book.\n\nMaking reference to the debate swirling around the book, the \"Times\" wrote:\n\nIn a perspective from \"The New York Times Book Review\", author Richard Reeves said that the book \"is a spectacular piece of reporting, with all the delights and limitations of journalism.\" Reeves also expressed concern over the sourcing matter, saying that they should have gotten some of their sources to go on record. All the same he concluded, \"Hell, I trust Woodward and Bernstein,\" saying \"not only are they great reporters,\" but that some of his own findings in researching the first days of the Presidency of Gerald R. Ford had confirmed some of their reporting regarding the last days of the Nixon one.\n\nIn a look back from three decades later, \"The Guardian\" called the book \"a meticulous recreation of the last hundred days of the Nixon presidency.\" In a 2018 retrospective ranking by Politico of all of Woodward's 20 books, including his newly released \"\", the ranking of \"The Final Days\" was second best, trailing only \"All the President's Men\". The Politico writer said of \"The Final Days\" that \"This book ... is fantastic, the model for all [by Woodward] that came after.\" Still, the manner of sources for the book remained a subject for debate as well.\n\nThe book was a major commercial success. It became Simon & Schuster's fastest selling book, surpassing by half again the rate of the publisher's previous fastest, 1960's \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\". It debuted atop The New York Times best seller list for the week of April 25, 1976. It stayed in the top spot for 18 weeks, and on the full list for 29 weeks total. Altogether \"The Final Days\" sold some 630,000 copies in hardcover.\n\nPaperback rights to the book were in April 1976 sold to Avon Books in a record-setting deal for $1.55 million, eclipsing a previous mark for any publisher for non-fiction works held by \"The Joy of Cooking\".\n\nAt the same time, the paperback edition of \"All the President's Men\" was atop that bestseller list and the film \"All the President's Men\" was the biggest box-office success in the land. All of these successes made both authors wealthy.\n\nThe book was the last collaboration between Woodward and Bernstein; quite dissimilar in personality, and with different approaches towards their newfound wealth, they soon went their separate ways.\n\nThe pair did reunite in print for the first time three and a half decades later, for a \"Washington Post\" op-ed column in 2012. In it they said that subsequent archival evidence and other historical accounts indicated that in the words of the column's title, \"Nixon was far worse than we thought.\" Making reference to \"The Final Days\", the pair said that their inclusion of anti-Semitic remarks and attitudes by Nixon in the book had been borne out by later revelations. The pair also sat for a joint retrospective '40 years later' interview on their Watergate reporting with CBS in 2014.\n\nIn his 1978 memoir \"RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon\", the former president gave an account of the famous night-before-resignation-announcement scene that presents it as shorter and more business-like, but allows that his sense of \"agony\" and \"loss\" became \"most acute\" for him that night. Kissinger's 1982 memoir \"Years of Upheaval\" calls the Woodward and Bernstein narrative \"an unfeeling account\" but presents a description of the encounter that is not that far away from theirs. Both Nixon and Kissinger have the encounter starting in the Lincoln Sitting Room but ending in the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\nIn 1989, a television adaptation of the book, also named \"The Final Days\", aired. It starred Lane Smith as Nixon. It was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards and one Golden Globe Award.\n\n"}

He now lives in Romford. Before turning professional, he worked for the Association of Accounting Technicians.\n\nHe has been known as \"Hawaii 501\" since 2000, a play on the title of the popular television series, \"Hawaii Five-O\", due to the Hawaiian shirts he started wearing in 1998 for a bet, and 501 being the start score of a leg of darts. This dress sense coupled with his crowd-pleasing onstage activity (such as dancing to the interval music) saw him become one of the most popular players on the circuit.\n\nWayne started playing darts at the age of 11, when he practised with his dad. His first 180 came two weeks after he started playing. He soon became better than his dad, and his first competition win was in a pub called the 'Double Top' on his 13th birthday in 1986.\n\nHis Lakeside debut came in 2000 where he lost to Matt Clark in the first round. In 2001 he reached the Semi Finals, beating Co Stompé and Ronnie Baxter before losing to eventual winner John Walton. His attempt in 2002 saw him fall in the last eight to Colin Monk.\n\nMardle joined the Professional Darts Corporation in time for the 2003 World Championship. His first appearance at the Circus Tavern saw him lose in the third round to Phil Taylor. His debut at Blackpool's Winter Gardens in the World Matchplay was much better, beating World Champion John Part, Alan Warriner and Colin Lloyd to reach the final, where he again lost to Taylor.\n\nMardle had until 2010, played in every Premier League except for 2007 due to poor form and disappointing results. 2005 and 2006 did not go well, and he finished bottom of the table in both years. (Players who come bottom of the League are said to have won the \"Mardle Cup,\" named in honour of him).\n\nDespite a poor 2006 and 2007, he found his form at the 2008 World Championship, ending Taylor's record of reaching every PDC World Darts Championship final on 29 December 2007 by defeating him 5 sets to 4 in a quarter-final match having trailed 3–0. Following his victory, he showed great emotion at finally defeating \"The Power\" on TV. Mardle was then beaten in the semi-finals for the fourth time in his PDC career by 21-year-old qualifier Kirk Shepherd. He later said this was the worst defeat of his career, citing his own attitude as \"disgusting\".\n\nIn January 2008 Mardle was confirmed as the Sky Sports wildcard entry to the 2008 PDC Darts Premier League following his impressive performance at the World Championships. Whilst this decision was questioned by some, Mardle proved the doubters wrong with a steady campaign which saw him finish in fifth place, missing out on the Play-Offs by just two legs to Adrian Lewis.\n\nWhilst he has reached fifth in the World Rankings and performed consistently well in the World Championship (reaching the semi-final in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008), he never won a major tournament as a member of the PDC. He has always seemed to suffer from what Sid Waddell called the \"Mardle Drift\", which sees his Darts continually land in 5 and Treble 5 instead of the 20/Treble 20.\n\nMardle suffered hard luck during the 2009 Premier League. After amassing just four points from his opening nine games, he missed week ten due to a virus. He had been due to return the following week, but was rushed into hospital the day before the matches due to mumps. With five matches to play in the final three weeks, one more missed week would eliminate Mardle from the competition. Sadly for Mardle, that occurred. Having been passed fit for a week twelve return, Mardle was re-admitted to hospital, and in accordance with tournament regulations, was removed from the tournament. His results from the tournament were also annulled.\n\nMardle's poor form continued in the 2010 PDC World Championship, where he lost to Jyhan Artut 3–0 with a poor average of 72. Mardle continued to drop out the rankings and was ranked as low as 85th in the Order of Merit.\n\nMardle also attempted to qualify for the 2012 PDC World Championship via the PDPA qualifier which was held in Wigan and was whitewashed 5–0 in the Preliminary Round by Ken Dobson.\n\nMardle's slide down the world rankings meant he was no longer assured of a PDC tour card to play on the Pro Tour, and had to enter the Q School to try and earn one. However, on the eve of the first Q School qualifier, Mardle announced on his Twitter page that he had decided not to go to Q School and instead focus on commentating for Sky Sports and playing in exhibitions.\n\nMardle made his commentating debut for the PDC at the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship, working alongside Sid Waddell in a few matches. He also co-presented some of the event with Dave Clark and predicting some of the match results with Rod Harrington and Eric Bristow. Mardle continued his analyzing and commentary career at the 2011 Premier League Darts apart from weeks 3, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 14.\n\nHe continued his commentary career in the 2012 PDC World Darts Championship, where he co-commentated on every night of the televised event. He has since become a regular on all Sky televised tournaments both as a commentator during matches and as the main pundit in the studio portions of the show. During the World Championships Mardle also has regular segments where he rewards crowd participation, either dancing, fancy dress outfits or funny signs, with a \"Wayne's World\" T-shirt.\n\nAlongside his successful darts career, away from the oche Mardle has been a keen advocate for the support of players suffering from dartitis. In 2013 Mardle spoke about former 5 Time World Champion Eric Bristow and outlined that Dartitis was \"the fear of throwing the dart\" and emphasised how it \"must've been awful\" for Bristow. It is this support that has earned Mardle plaudits from many within the darting circle for his well articulated support and awareness on the subject.\n\nIn 2017 Mardle threw his considerable support behind upcoming youngster Berry van Peer following a severe case of Dartitis during the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton. Despite this set back Mardle has outlined that Van Peer has \"bounce back-ability\" and has the potential to be a \"future World Champion\".\n\nMardle married Donna on 2 July 2002. The couple are good friends with ladies' darts player Crissy Manley, wife of three-time PDC World Championship runner-up Peter.\n\nIn 2006, Mardle had a darts book published (co-authored with Ian Spragg) entitled \"Hawaii 501 – Life As A Darts Pro\". It chronicles the ups and downs of his life as a professional darts player during 2005.\n\nMardle supports the football team Tottenham Hotspur and appeared in the May 2009 Edition of \"Hotspur\", the football club's official club magazine.\n\n\n\n"}

A retired military serviceman, Simmons murdered 14 members of his family, including a daughter he had sexually abused and the child he had fathered with her, a former co-worker, and a stranger, and wounded four others.\n\nSimmons was sentenced to death 16 times, and after refusing to appeal his sentence, was executed in Arkansas on June 25, 1990.\n\nRonald Gene Simmons was born on July 15, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, to Loretta and William Simmons. On January 31, 1943, William Simmons died of a stroke and within a year, Simmons's mother had remarried, this time to William D. Griffen, a civil engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 1946, the corps moved Griffen to Little Rock, Arkansas, the first of several transfers that would take the family across central Arkansas over the next decade.\n\nOn September 15, 1957, Simmons dropped out of school and joined the U.S. Navy, and was first stationed at Naval Station Bremerton in Washington, where he met Bersabe Rebecca \"Becky\" Ulibarri, whom he married in New Mexico on July 9, 1960. Over the next 18 years, the couple had seven children. In 1963, Simmons left the navy, and approximately two years later joined the U.S. Air Force. During his 20-year military career, Simmons was awarded a Bronze Star Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross for his service as an airman, and the Airforce Ribbon for Excellent Marksmanship. Simmons retired from the air force and military service on November 30, 1979, with the rank of master sergeant.\n\nOn April 3, 1981, Simmons was being investigated by the Cloudcroft, New Mexico, Department of Human Services for allegations that he had fathered a child with his 17-year-old daughter, Sheila, whom he had been sexually abusing. Fearing arrest, Simmons fled New Mexico in late 1981 with his family, first to Ward, Arkansas in Lonoke County, and then to Dover, Arkansas in Pope County in the summer of 1983. The family took up residence on a 13-acre tract of land 6.5 miles north of Dover that would become known as Mockingbird Hill. The residence was constructed of two older-model mobile homes joined to form one large home, neither of which had a telephone nor indoor plumbing, and was surrounded by a makeshift privacy fence which was as high as 10-feet tall in some places.\n\nSimmons worked a string of low-paying jobs in the nearby town of Russellville, Arkansas. He quit a position as an accounts receivable clerk at Woodline Motor Freight after numerous reports of inappropriate sexual advances and went to work at a Sinclair Mini Mart for approximately a year and a half before quitting on December 18, 1987.\n\nShortly before Christmas 1987, Simmons decided to kill all the members of his family. On the morning of December 22, he first killed his wife Rebecca and eldest son Gene by shooting them with a .22-caliber pistol and then killed his three-year-old granddaughter Barbara by strangulation. Simmons dumped the bodies in a cesspit he had forced his children to dig previously. Simmons then waited for his other children to return to the house, and after their arrival, he told them he had presents for them, but wanted to give them one at a time. He first killed his daughter, 17-year-old Loretta, whom Simmons strangled and held under the water in a rain barrel. The three other children, Eddy, Marianne, and Becky, were then killed in the same way.\n\nAround mid-day on December 26, the remaining members of the family arrived for their Christmas visit. The first to be killed was Simmons' son Billy and his wife Renata, who were both shot dead. He then strangled and drowned their 20-month-old son, Trae. Simmons shot and killed his oldest daughter, Sheila (whom he had sexually abused), and her husband, Dennis McNulty. Simmons then strangled his child by Sheila, seven-year-old Sylvia Gail, and finally his 21-month-old grandson Michael. Simmons laid the bodies of his whole family in neat rows in the lounge. All the corpses were covered with coats except that of Sheila, who was covered by Rebecca Simmons' best tablecloth. The bodies of the two grandsons were wrapped in plastic sheeting and left in abandoned cars at the end of the lane. After the murders, Simmons went for a drink in a local bar, then returned to the house and, apparently oblivious to the corpses lined up around him, spent the rest of the evening and the following day drinking beer and watching television.\n\nOn the morning of December 28, Simmons drove into Russellville, walked into a law office, and killed the receptionist, a young woman named Kathy Kendrick. Simmons had previously been infatuated with Kendrick, but she had rejected him. He next went to an oil company office, where he shot dead a man named J.D. Chaffin and wounded the owner, Rusty Taylor, and then drove on to a convenience store where he had previously worked, shooting and wounding two more people. Afterwards, Simmons went to the office of the Woodline Motor Freight Company, where he shot and wounded a woman. Simmons then simply sat in the office and chatted with one of the secretaries while waiting for the police. When they arrived, Simmons handed over his gun and surrendered without any resistance.\n\nSimmons was charged with 16 counts of murder, found guilty, and sentenced to death. He refused to appeal his death sentence, stating, \"To those who oppose the death penalty - in my particular case, anything short of death would be cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nJohn Bynum successfully prosecuted the case. Simmons was first tried for the Russellville crimes, and a jury convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death. He made an additional statement, under oath, supporting his sentence:\n\nI, Ronald Gene Simmons, Sr., want it to be known that it is my wish and my desire that absolutely no action by anybody be taken to appeal or in any way change this sentence. It is further respectfully requested that this sentence be carried out expeditiously.\n\nThe trial court conducted a hearing concerning Simmons' competence to waive further proceedings, and concluded that his decision was knowing and intelligent.\n\nSimmons became the subject of the United States Supreme Court Case \"Whitmore v. Arkansas\" when another death row inmate, Jonas Whitmore, attempted, unsuccessfully, to force an appeal of Simmons' case.\n\nWhile on death row, Simmons had to be separated from other prisoners as his life was threatened constantly. This was because he refused to appeal his death sentence; the other prisoners believed Simmons was damaging their chances of beating their own death sentences.\n\nOn May 31, Arkansas governor (later President) Bill Clinton signed Simmons' execution warrant, and on June 25, 1990, he died by the method he had chosen, lethal injection in the Cummins Unit. None of his relatives would claim the body, and he was buried in a potter's field.\n\n\n\n"}

Although mostly recorded years earlier, it was released on the group's 1975 double album, \"Physical Graffiti\".\n\nWriting for the song began in 1970 at Bron-Yr-Aur, a rustic retreat in South Snowdonia, Wales. Initially an acoustic piece, it took on a hard rock arrangement when recorded at Stargroves during the sessions for the \"Houses of the Holy\" album in 1972. The song was not included on the album, but after Jimmy Page added several guitar overdubs in 1974, it was added to Led Zeppelin's following album, \"Physical Graffiti\".\n\nIn a contemporary review of \"Physical Graffiti\", Jim Miller of \"Rolling Stone\" gave \"The Rover\" a mixed review, saying that while Page and Bonham \"mount a bristling attack\", the track \"suffers from Plant's indefinite pitch.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review of \"Physical Graffiti (Deluxe Edition)\", Jon Hadusek of \"Consequence of Sound\" described Jimmy Page's guitar lines in \"The Rover\" some of his most underrated guitar lines he's ever recorded.\n\n\"The Rover\" was never played live in its entirety at Led Zeppelin concerts, although the band played the opening bars as an introduction to \"Sick Again\" throughout their 1977 North American tour. However, the song was rehearsed in full, as can be heard on bootleg recordings of the band's soundcheck rehearsal at the Chicago Stadium on 6 July 1973. This rehearsal took place before the opening date of the second leg of the band's 1973 North American tour.\n\nCitations\nReferences\n"}
{"id": "2158619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158619", "title": "British Darts Organisation", "text": "British Darts Organisation\n\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) is a darts organisation founded on 7 January 1973 by Olly Croft. The BDO was a founder member of the World Darts Federation which was formed in 1976 but due to a recent WDF ruling they are now considered an associate member. The BDO is made up of 66 member counties in Britain and organises tournaments for semi-professionals (all current players have a day job) and amateurs.\n\nThe BDO set the rules which govern the game of darts, including the distance of the throwing oche (2.37m / 7 ft 9 ¼ inches) and the height and dimensions of the board. The BDO organised the first World Professional Darts Championship in 1978, known for many years as The Embassy – due to its sponsorship by Imperial Tobacco. It was then known as the Lakeside World Professional Darts Championship – or Lakeside for short, and is now being played at a new venue, and is no longer recognised by the World Darts Federation.\n\nAfter the World Championship began, televised darts became more prevalent with many major tournaments appearing on ITV and BBC. But by 1984, darts had lost many of its sponsors and only the World Championship remained on television. Some players became frustrated by the lack of opportunity to make a living professionally.\n\nA group of 19 players (including all previous World Champions who were still active in the game) created the World Darts Council (WDC), later the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) towards the end of 1990. They wanted more tournaments to be staged and to appoint a PR consultant to improve the image of the game.\n\nThe 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last unified world darts championship. On 7 January 1993, the rebel players issued a joint statement affirming that they would only compete in the 1994 tournament if it was held under the auspices of the WDC. The BDO responded by banning the rebel players from all BDO tournaments. After a long legal battle, the BDO was forced to acknowledge the WDC's legitimacy and the right of players to choose which body they competed for. In return the WDC dropped its claim to being the sport's governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation.\n\nSince there have been two World Championships from 1994 onwards, there have been calls for head-to-head matches between the two Winners. There have been two head-to-head matches between the reigning champions of the two organisations. The challenge matches, held in 1999 and 2004, were officially recognised as undisputed championship matches. In their respective matches, the incumbent BDO champions Raymond van Barneveld and Andy Fordham were defeated by the PDC champion Phil Taylor.\n\nThe BDO board have continued to support players from the grassroots of the game since the \"split\", although there have been several high-profile players who have made a name within the organisation only to later join the PDC.\n\nRaymond van Barneveld's career in the BDO helped boost the popularity of the sport in his home country, the Netherlands. Dutch broadcaster SBS6 has broadcast the World Championship since 1998, and used to show two major BDO tournaments, the International Darts League and World Darts Trophy. Both no longer exist. However, the popularity of the sport has possibly contributed to the Netherlands making more star players, including the 2006 BDO World Champion, Jelle Klaasen, and the 2006 World Masters Champion, Michael van Gerwen.\n\nDue to the greater prize money available on the PDC tour, a growing number of BDO players have \"defected\" to the PDC. Four-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld was the highest profile switch, doing so in 2006. John Part (1997), Richie Burnett (2000), Steve Beaton (2001), Jelle Klaasen (2007), Mark Webster (2009), Ted Hankey (2012), Les Wallace (2013), Christian Kist (2014), Stephen Bunting, and Glen Durrant (2017, 2018, 2019), are the other past BDO champions who subsequently switched to the PDC.\n\nBDO number 1 Robert Thornton decided to move to the PDC in May 2008. 2006 Winmau World Masters winner Michael van Gerwen switched without defending his title. Long time BDO player Mervyn King (who once claimed he would never play for the PDC) followed suit a month later. Gary Anderson and Webster were the top two ranked players when they signed with the PDC in January 2009. 2008 Lakeside runner-up Simon Whitlock also signed with the PDC in 2009.\n\nVery few players have moved the other way. 2004 Lakeside champion Andy Fordham moved to the PDC in 2009 and returned to the BDO in 2013. Three time BDO women's champion Anastasia Dobromyslova switched to the PDC in 2008, before returning in 2011. Ted Hankey, after switching to the PDC in 2012, returned to the BDO in 2014. Of recent though Andy Hamilton and Wes Newton began playing in BDO events at the start of 2018 after losing their PDC tour cards and both qualified for the 2019 BDO world championship.\n\nPrior to the 2011 Annual General Meeting of the BDO, many players and officials within the organisation had expressed increasing degrees of dissatisfaction with the performance of the existing Board of Directors. Particular areas of concern were the BDO's apparent stagnation in terms of creating new televised events and gaining new sponsors. An open letter was circulated to the various counties within the BDO structure, setting out the perceived issues, although the said letter was vague as to actual suggestions for improvement. Matters culminated at the subsequent AGM, where all but one of the incumbent Board were voted out of office (other than Dave Alderman who had already resigned), with only Vic Sexton retaining his seat.\n\nThere were a number of problems at the 2019 World Masters. Several seeded players opted not to participate in the event in protest at a change to qualifying criteria. Other players who did attend found they were unregistered, having been unaware of a new rule which required them to register in advance online. Due to the confusion, officials announced that there would be a redraw, which included fake names, apparently so they could be substituted if more real players arrived. Players were also not informed of the event's prizemoney in advance. \n\nDue to the issues at the World Masters, the World Darts Federation subsequently released a statement announcing that the BDO was to be demoted to \"associate member\" status and the WDF would no longer recognise BDO-organised tournaments. They cited the recent \"breach of rules\" and \"draw changes during their competition\", adding \"we cannot be a part of or support such activities.\"\n\nOn 30 December 2019, five days before the start of the 2020 BDO World Championship, BDO chairman Des Jacklin announced that prizemoney for the upcoming event would have to be \"reduced somewhat\", although the BDO did not confirm what the new prize fund would be. He cited the failure to secure a sponsor for the event, and the fact that only 15% of tickets had been sold. The reduction in the prize fund and the failure to confirm the reduced amounts that players would receive was criticised by a number of players. In protest at the reduced prizemoney on offer, Fallon Sherrock, runner-up in the 2015 women's event, confirmed that she would be withdrawing from the competition. Ultimately, champion Wayne Warren received £23,000, a 77% reduction on the previous year's prizemoney and the lowest amount received by a winner of the tournament since 1989.\n\nBDO Events Ltd is the commercial arm of the BDO (British Darts Organisation) and was set up in 2013. The annual BDO Major events comprises the following British televised events:\n\nThe World Championship is the biggest of the tournaments, held at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, UK. The tournament started in 1978 and for the first 15 years it was a unified World Championship, before a separate competition (the PDC World Championship) began in 1994. There have been 24 different winners of the event and Eric Bristow is the player with the most BDO World titles including a hat-trick between 1984 and 1986. Raymond van Barneveld matched his overall haul of five world titles when he won the PDC version in 2007. Phil Taylor has also won the PDC title 14 times to bring his tally to 16 world titles.\n\nIn December 2019 the World Darts Federation announced that it would no longer recognise the BDO as the ruling body of darts in the UK, no longer recognised the BDO World Championships and thus it no longer became a recognised world championship.\n\nThe World Masters is the longest running BDO major title, having started as far back as 1974. It is the second biggest major title on the BDO stage. Having been first staged in Fulham, the tournament has been to Wembley, Earls Court, Kensington, the Lakeside Country Club and others. It is currently held at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet. \n\nThe tournament features shorter sets than the World Championship – each set is the best of three legs instead of five at Lakeside. In the 40-year history of the event, only 7 players have managed to win the title on more than one occasion. Eric Bristow holds the record for most tournament wins with five. Bob Anderson and Martin Adams hold the record of winning the title three years running 86, 87, 88 for Anderson and 08, 09, 10 for Adams. Only 14 players have won both the Masters and World titles in their career.\n\nThe BDO World Trophy is the Newest \"Major\" Darts tournament added to the BDO's events calendar from 2014 onwards, organized by the BDO Events – the new commercial arm of the British Darts Organisation.\n\nThe Topic International Darts League was a tournament staged in the Netherlands and formed the second leg of the Grand Slam having been introduced in 2003. Whilst its format has evolved in recent years, it features players competing in a round-robin tournament. The 2006 event featured 32 players in 8 groups of 4, which were then reduced to 4 further groups of 4. The top two in each group then went through to the knockout stages.\n\nWhen Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC in 2006, the tournament organisers agreed with the BDO to invite four players from the rival organisation. Van Barneveld (PDC) went on to win the title for the third time in 2006 and Gary Anderson (BDO) won the 2007 event. This remains the only major event to date that Phil Taylor hasn't won in either the BDO or PDC.\n\nThe World Darts Trophy (WDT) was the third BDO major of the year and the second to be held in the Netherlands. Its straight knock-out format is comparable to the two versions of the World Championship.\n\nThe WDT followed the International Darts League by inviting four PDC players to the tournament in 2006, and again a PDC player (Phil Taylor) won the title.\n\nThe British Gold Cup began in 1978 and was held in Stoke. It was broadcast on BBC until 1982, with the 1983 tournament blacked out due to a technician's strike. It was then broadcast in 2008 on Setanta Sports in the UK, After a brief stint on the short-lived channel Wire TV (94–95).\n\nThe Unipart British Professional Championship was a tournament televised by the BBC between 1981 and 1988. After the 1988 championships, the BBC withdrew their coverage of the event and it left UK terrestrial television with only one televised tournament – the World Championships. The game was at an all-time low and players eventually went on to set up the World Darts Council in an attempt to bring back sponsors and television.\n\nJocky Wilson won the title a record four times – John Lowe also reached four finals but lost them all.\n\nBritish Matchplay ran from 1976 to 1983 with a brief revival in 1986. The tournament was broadcast on the ITV network in 1978, but usually broadcast regionally including Anglia Television in 1977 and Central in 1986.\n\nNot to be confused with the long-running game show \"Bullseye\", this was a BBC2 tournament which ran for three years during the peak of darts boom period at the turn of the eighties. Jocky Wilson was twice the winner.\n\nATV broadcast the Butlins Grand Masters between 1977 and 1988. Matches were played over the best of nine legs. The tournament was held at a pub in Birmingham. Bobby George was twice the winner and Eric Bristow won a hat-trick of titles.\n\nThe MFI World Matchplay championship was short-lived but historic in darts as it featured the first ever televised nine-dart finish on 13 October 1984 when John Lowe won £102,000 for the perfect game of darts against Keith Deller. Lowe went on to win the title that year. The tournament was broadcast on ITV and originally came from the Fulcrum Centre, Slough before switching to Festival Hall, Basildon. ITV ceased coverage after the 1988 championships and the tournament ended. ITV also pulled coverage of the World Masters after the 1988 event, leaving the BBC as the only broadcaster of darts until 1992.\n\nThe PDC introduced a new version of World Matchplay in 1994.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158621", "title": "Joe Dolan", "text": "Joe Dolan\n\nJoseph Francis Robert \"Joe\" Dolan (16 October 1939 – 26 December 2007), otherwise known as Boots, was an Irish entertainer, recording artist, and pop singer. Chiefly known in Ireland for his association with showbands and for his innovative style and high pitched singing voice, he had a wide appeal with many international fans. His energetic and charismatic stage performances were well known as was his long standing advertising slogan: \"There's no show like a Joe show\".\n\nThe only Irish singer to reach number one in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Dolan was a constant presence on the hit parade in Ireland and overseas.\n\nDolan was born at the County Hospital, now known as the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, County Westmeath on 16 October 1939, the youngest of eight children in a Roman Catholic family. He was orphaned at a young age – his father, a bicycle shop proprietor, died when Joe was eight; his mother when he was fifteen. He sang in school, and his mother had encouraged him to take up the piano. He made his first stage appearance at a talent show held in a marquee on the Fair Green in his native Mullingar.\n\nDolan's voice was high with a comprehensive range without the use of falsetto and he made comprehensive use of a technique known as melisma which gives the vocal a plaintive edge reminiscent of Arabic religious chanting. Vocal gymnastics such as this were not common in the 1960s and 1970s but were later made popular by artists such as Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston, among others.\n\nAs well as securing his first (and last) \"real\" job as a compositor in local newspaper The \"Westmeath Examiner\" in 1958, he got his first guitar. After learning some skills on the instrument, he and his saxophone-playing brother Ben started to play in local bands. They soon formed a band of their own – The Drifters. Not long afterward, the band was renamed Joe Dolan and the Drifters and finally Joe Dolan and \"His\" Drifters to avoid legal action from the American band of the same name.\n\nThe Irish musical landscape in the 1960s was dominated by the showbands. The first single \"The Answer to Everything\", (previously released as a B side by Del Shannon) was released in September 1964, quickly reaching number 4 in the Irish charts. Dolan and his band were managed by Seamus Casey. In the summer of 1968, however, some of the band left, with Dolan and Casey citing \"musical differences\" as the reason, although in the official biography by Ronan Casey (Seamus Casey's son) further elaboration includes references to unhappiness about financial issues.\n\nDolan's first US tour was in 1965 and followed an offer, which he refused, to play in Las Vegas. Instead, he decided to play a whistle-stop tour of Irish-American venues in places such as Chicago, New York and Boston. An added benefit to this string of engagements was the opportunity to hear American music which hadn't yet been played in the UK and Ireland. The first song gleaned in this fashion was the Jim Reeves song, \"(That's When I see the Blue in Your) Pretty Brown Eyes\" which Dolan released on the Pye label in 1966.\n\nA second US tour in 1967 led an offer to appear in Las Vegas, but he turned it down. Eventually in 1980 he accepted $10,000 a week plus board and lodgings to perform for six weeks over September and October at the Continental Lounge of the Silverbird Casino on the Strip in Las Vegas. Eventually playing 64 shows and selling out most of them, he and his band returned to Ireland to be immediately rebooked for Vegas in January 1981. Although he turned down subsequent offers to return to Vegas, other venues approached him with increased offers, thinking he was merely hunting around for the best deal, but Dolan refused them all. Several other attempts were made through the years to entice him back but he never returned – except on holiday.\n\nIn 1978, he became the first Irish artist and one of the first Western acts to tour communist Russia.\n\nDolan toured the segregation era in South Africa and was on a UN blacklist for defying the artists' ban.\n\nAfter reforming the band Dolan recorded a song called \"Make Me an Island\", written by the songwriting duo Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood, for Pye Records in conjunction with Shaftesbury Publishing. The track was a hit in England and led to Dolan's first appearance on the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\" and helped to make him the biggest Irish star in the world at that time, eventually becoming a number one hit in 14 countries, as well as reaching Number 3 in the UK, becoming Joe Dolan's only British Top 10 hit, and one of only four hit singles Dolan ever had in the UK (all of these hits performed better in the Irish Charts).\n\nIn Ireland, the song peaked at number 2 in August 1969, the same week it was Number 3 in the UK. It has been claimed that Dolan was the first Irish star to appear on \"Top of the Pops\", although this supposes that neither The Bachelors nor Val Doonican appeared on the show between 1964 and 1969 (which seems at least doubtful given that both had several big hits in both the UK and Ireland in the mid-'sixties). After the recording of \"Make Me An Island\", Dolan was approached and signed by the MAM Agency whose major star was Tom Jones.\n\nFollow-up singles \"Teresa\" and \"You're Such a Good Looking Woman\" also made an impact. Other single releases such as \"It Makes No Difference\" and \"You and the Looking Glass\" were not big hits at home in Ireland or in the UK, but they were international successes. A collaboration with writers Roberto Danova and Peter Yellowstone in the mid-1970s produced more singles which made little impact on the British domestic market but did well internationally. \"Sweet Little Rock 'n' Roller\" (1974) was the first of a number of reasonable successes for this team but wasn't a major hit in the UK until later recorded by Showaddywaddy, who had a Top 20 hit with the song in 1979.\n\nHis next single, \"Lady in Blue\" was his biggest ever hit, winning five gold records and selling one million copies. It was popular in Europe, Australasia, Africa and South America but not in Ireland or the UK. Further hits including \"Crazy Woman\", \"Sister Mary\", \"Midnight Lover\", \"Hush Hush Maria\" and \"I Need You\" followed. Reflective songs such as \"If I Could Put My Life on Paper\" were a collaborative attempt to show a more maturing artist, whilst definitive versions of songs such as \"Danny Boy\" maintained a touch of Irish on disc and in concert. In any given month Dolan could be touring the Middle East one week, Australia the next, then South Africa and then back to Europe and Ireland. Further international successes and tours followed, with hits such as \"More and More\" and \"It's You, It's You, It's You\".\n\nWith his own record label, studio and material Dolan became one of the biggest selling independent artists of the 1990s with albums such as 'Endless Magic' keeping him near the top of the charts. At the end of the decade he refined his voice for the 21st century when he hooked up with EMI for a series of albums (such as \"Joe's 90s\", \"21st Century Joe\" and \"Home Grown\") which saw him tackle more contemporary music from acts as diverse as Oasis, Pulp, Blur, U2, Bruce Springsteen, The Coral, R.E.M., Mundy and his old pal Robbie Williams. At the Oxegen Festival 2009, Blur's Damon Albarn dedicated the song \"The Universal\" to Dolan.\n\nDolan never married and dealt with speculation about his sexuality throughout his life. He dismissed persistent rumours that he was gay. The official biography suggests that he had a quiet offstage presence and preferred to keep romances out of the public eye but cites a long relationship with Isabella Fogarty whom he met in 1977, started dating in the 1980s and subsequently lived with. She was with him when he became ill on 25 December 2007.\n\nIn September 1970, Dolan and his band were performing at the Wookie Hollow Club in Liverpool. Dolan and a member of his road crew stayed in the venue for drinks and to chat to their fans. Some people at a nearby table were attempting to bully the (by now closed) bar into providing them with champagne. Dolan joked that they should come back in a few hours for a \"champagne breakfast\". The men took exception to this and became abusive. Dolan and his companion tried to leave but were prevented from doing so. During the following fracas Dolan was headbutted, (breaking his nose) kicked, punched and slammed into lavatory fittings and a wall in a sustained attack which was only halted when the sound of police sirens could be heard. It took six weeks for the singer to recover well enough to return to work. The club was sued but went into liquidation. The police attempted to identify the perpetrators and held identity parades which Dolan attended but no-one was ever prosecuted.\n\nIn October 1976, Dolan and a group of friends were flying with Aer Lingus to Corfu for a golfing trip. On several occasions during the flight Dolan was moving around talking to other passengers who knew him. One of the party remembers they were \"quite merry\". The singer was asked several times by cabin staff to return to his seat and, finally, after being threatened with being \"restrained\" he did so. Upon landing, he attempted to leave the airport without his luggage and passport but was prevented from doing so by security staff, one of whom drew his pistol and pointed it at Dolan. \n\nThe tour operator subsequently received a fax from Aer Lingus refusing to fly the star back to Dublin. Newspaper headlines in Ireland proclaimed the star's airline ban for life although, as it transpired, the ban only lasted for close to two years, eventually being lifted after the airline negotiated with the star following his continued references to it on stage and in the media.\n\nDolan's health began to decline after he underwent a hip replacement in 2005, which put him off the road for 12 months and led to the discovery of Type 2 Diabetes which appeared to account for the low energy levels he had been experiencing. In a bizarre twist, following a discussion with Keith Duffy of the boyband Boyzone, the hip bone which was replaced was signed and auctioned for €650, the proceeds being given to Irish Autism Action. Dolan returned to his schedule in 2006, initially with vigour, but soon began to report further signs of low energy. Doctors diagnosed a low blood platelet count and Dolan began a series of blood transfusions, After each, he felt better for a period, but always began to feel weaker again. At this same time, Dolan was also suffering from unexplained nosebleeds. In autumn 2007, on advice from his doctors, Dolan cancelled his Vicar Street concerts due to \"exhaustion\".\n\nOn 16 December 2007, the front page of the \"Sunday Independent\" reported that Dolan was suffering from a \"bad virus\" and had been forced to cancel his entire Christmas tour. Dolan's website was inundated with well wishes in the wake of the article, which was reproduced in several newspapers the following day. Despite the blood transfusions and other medical interventions, Dolan became weaker and he was finally discharged from the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin on 23 December 2007 in a wheelchair.\n\nDolan spent Christmas Day 2007 at his home in Foxrock in southeast Dublin with some friends. Later that evening, his illness suddenly worsened, and he was rushed by ambulance to the Mater Hospital. En route to the hospital, Dolan suffered a massive intracerebral haemorrhage, at which he became unconscious, and was connected to life support equipment upon his arrival. At approximately 14:30 hours on St Stephen's Day, surrounded by family and friends, the machines were switched off and Dolan died within 20 minutes, never regaining consciousness. He was pronounced dead at 15:03 hours. He was 68 years old.\n\nHis funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of Christ the King, Mullingar, on 29 December 2007. Many famous faces from both sides of the border attended, including singer Ronnie Drew from The Dubliners, comedian Frank Carson, snooker legend Denis Taylor and former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. \n\nDolan is interred in Walshestown Cemetery, Walshestown North, County Westmeath.\n\nA bridge was named after him in the Clonmore Industrial Estate in his hometown of Mullingar, it opened officially on 6 September 2010; it is the second longest bridge in the Republic Of Ireland. There is a statue of Dolan in Mullingar's Market Square. \n\nDolan's hip bone is the only body part to ever be sold on eBay. The singer had initially sold his bone at a charity auction before his death and it was later sold on eBay.\n\n\n\n\nCasey, Ronan, \"Joe Dolan, The Official Biography\", Penguin Ireland 2008, \n\n"}

The magazine was a large-format tabloid focused on the Los Angeles punk scene. With relatively wide distribution for a punk zine, \"Slash\" helped bring the L.A. underground scene to the attention of the rest of the world. The fanzine also gave birth to Slash Records, an important punk record label.\n\nIt regularly covered such L.A. bands as The Screamers, The Skulls, Nervous Gender, and X. It did not restrict itself to local acts; its first cover featured Dave Vanian of The Damned. It also featured articles and reviews on reggae, blues, and rockabilly, in doing so, introduced punk audiences to a wide range of then-unfamiliar musical genres.\n\nWriters Claude \"Kickboy Face\" Bessy, Craig Lee, Richard Meltzer, Jeffrey Lee Pierce, Chris D. and Pleasant Gehman, and cartoonist Gary Panter were among the major contributors. Photo contributors included David Arnoff, Susan Carson, Kerry Colonna, Ed Colver, Diane Gamboa, Frank Gargani, Jenny Lens, Melanie Nissen, Donna Santisi, Ann Summa, Scott Lindgren, and coeditor Philomena Winstanley.\n\n\"Slash\" magazine folded in 1980, as many of the main principals involved were increasingly concentrating on other activities. Bob Biggs was more involved in running the label; many of the writers were concentrating on their own musical activities. In addition, there was a widespread perception that punk rock was dying, as movements such as post-punk, hardcore, and deathrock were emerging while many of the original Los Angeles punk bands (such as the Germs and The Weirdos) were breaking up, and in such a changing environment \"Slash\" had essentially served its purpose.\n"}
{"id": "2158629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158629", "title": "HMS Phoebe (1795)", "text": "HMS Phoebe (1795)\n\nHMS \"Phoebe\" was a 36-gun fifth rate of the Royal Navy. She had a career of almost twenty years and fought in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Overall, her crews were awarded six clasps to the Naval General Service Medals, with two taking place in the French Revolutionary Wars, three during the Napoleonic Wars and the sixth in the War of 1812. Three of the clasps carried the name \"Phoebe\". During her career, \"Phoebe\" sailed to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, North America and South America.\n\nOnce peace finally arrived, \"Phoebe\" was laid up, though she spent a few years as a slop ship during the 1820s. She was then hulked. The Admiralty finally sold her for breaking up in 1841.\n\nShe was one of four frigates that the Admiralty ordered on 24 May 1794 to a design by Sir John Henslow, Surveyor of the Navy, to be a faster version of the 1781 \"Perseverance\" class frigates. The contract for the first ship was placed with the Thames-side yard of John Dudman, where the keel was laid in June 1794. She was named \"Phoebe\" on 26 February 1795 and was launched on 24 September 1795 at Deptford Wharf on the Thames. She then moved to Deptford Dockyard, where she was completed on 23 December.\n\n\"Phoebe\" was first commissioned in October 1795 under Captain Robert Barlow, for the Irish Coast and Edward Pellew's squadron. On 10 January 1797, after an eight-hour chase, she captured the 16-gun , under the command of Lieutenant Dordelin, off the Isles of Scilly. \"Atalante\" had a crew of 112 men. She was a three-year-old brig with a coppered hull and an 80-foot keel. The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name.\n\nIn 1797 \"Phoebe\" was off Brest as part of an inshore squadron of frigates under Sir Edward Pellew in . The squadron included , and the hired armed lugger \"Duke of York\".\n\nOn 22 December 1797 \"Phoebe\" captured the French 36-gun \"Néréide\", Captain Antoine Canon. \"Phoebe\" sighted the \"Néréide\" at 10am; the pursuit started at 11:30am and ended at 10:45pm with \"Néréide's\" surrender. During the chase \"Néréide\" fired her stern guns at \"Phoebe\" and the two vessels exchanged broadsides shortly before the \"Néréide\" surrendered. \"Phoebe\" lost three men killed and 10 wounded; \"Néréide\" lost 20 men killed and 55 wounded. Part of the reason for the disparity in casualties was that the ratio of the weight of the broadsides was 407 pounds to 268 pounds. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Phoebe 21 Decr. 1797\" to all remaining members of her crew who had participated in the action.\n\nOn 11 October 1799, \"Phoebe\" captured the French privateer \"Grand Ferrailleur\". \"Grand Ferrailleur\" was armed with sixteen brass 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 121 men. She was 16 days from Bordeaux but had not taken any prizes.\n\nOn 21 February 1800, \"Phoebe\" captured the French privateer \"Bellegarde\" (or \"Belle Garde\") of Saint-Malo. \"Bellegarde\" carried 14 guns and a crew of 114 men. She had been out 16 days and had captured \"Chance\", of London and sailing from Martinique, and the brig \"Friends\", of Dartmouth, sailing from St. Michael's to Bristol. Later, on 24 February, recaptured \"Chance\".\n\nOn 5 March, \"Phoebe\" captured the privateer \"Heureux\" in the English Channel off Bordeaux. \"Heureux\" had intended to cruise the West Indies. Instead, she arrived at Plymouth on 25 March.\n\n\"Heureux\", of 22 long brass 12-pounders and 220 men, mistook \"Phoebe\" for an East Indiaman, and approached her. \"Heureux\" did not discover her mistake until she had arrived within point-blank musket-shot. \"Heureux\" fired on \"Phoebe\" in an \"Act of Temerity to be regretted\". Her hope was that well-directed fire would disable \"Phoebe's\" masts, rigging, and sails, and thereby enable \"Heureux\" to escape. \"Phoebe\" returned fire and \"Heureux\" was forced to strike her colours. \"Phoebe\" had three seamen killed or mortally wounded, and three slightly wounded. \"Heureux\" had 18 men killed and 25 wounded, most of whom lost limbs. She had been out 42 days but had captured only a small Portuguese sloop that the wind had pushed out to sea while the sloop was sailing from Limerick to Galway with a cargo of wine.\n\nBarlow described \"Heureux\" as \"the most complete flush Deck Ship I have ever seen, coppered, Copper fastened, highly finished and of large Dimensions... The Accounts given of her Sailing are very extraordinary; she will be considered as a most desirable Ship for His Majesty's Service.\" The British took her into service as .\n\nOn 19 February 1801, about six miles east of Gibraltar, \"Phoebe\" sighted a French ship off Ceuta, also sailing eastwards. Barlow chased the French vessel for two-and-a-half hours before he could bring her to a close action. After about two hours the French vessel struck her colours; she had five feet of water in her hold and was almost a wreck. \"Phoebe\"s fire had dismounted her guns and left her decks strewn with hundreds of casualties.\n\nShe proved to be \"Africaine\", of twenty-six 18-pounders and eighteen 9-pounders; she had sailed from Rochefort on the 13th. She was under the command of Capitaine Majendie and she flew the broad pennant of Commandant de Division Saunier. She had a crew of 315 men, but also was ferrying 400 troops under General Desfourneaux to reinforce the French invasion force in Egypt.\n\nThe French reported that they had suffered 200 killed in the action, including Saunier, the Chef de Brigade and two army captains, and 143 wounded, the later including Desfourneaux and Majendie, who was wounded in two places. The heavy casualties were the result of French troops crowding the upper deck despite their small arms fire contributing little or nothing in the dark to her defense. The troops had refused shelter below deck on the basis of mistaken valour.\n\n\"Phoebe\" lost one man killed, and 12 men wounded. Her masts, sails and rigging were badly damaged but she was able to limp to Port Mahon. Weak winds resulted in the voyage, in company with \"Africaine\", taking two weeks. The British took \"Africaine\" into service under her existing name.\n\nBarlow received a knighthood. \"Phoebe\"s first lieutenant, John Wentworth Holland, who had been wounded, received a promotion to commander. In 1847 the action earned \"Phoebe's\" crew the clasp \"Phoebe 19 Feby. 1801\" to the Naval General Service Medal (1847). Captain Thomas Baker subsequently took command of \"Phoebe\" in May 1801.\n\nIn June 1802 Capt. James Shephard took command. Captain The Hon. Thomas Bladen Capell followed him and recommissioned \"Phoebe\" in September. She then sailed for the Mediterranean on 28 September.\n\nIn 1803 \"Phoebe\" was sailing out of Malta. At some point, perhaps during the summer, her boats participated in a disastrous attack on two French privateers off Civitavecchia. The privateers repulsed the British, who lost eight men killed and wounded. On 1 August, \"Phoebe\" captured two settées, which a French squadron recaptured. In recapturing the settees, the French squadron involved lost an opportunity to capture \"Phoebe\", though they did capture the schooner and a transport.\n\nOn 13 June \"Phoebe\" and \"Amazon\" made ready to engage two French frigates anchored under the guns of the north-most fort at Toulon. The fort fired at \"Phoebe\", but she was out of range. When the French fleet sortied, the British vessels rejoined their squadron, however the French fleet returned to port without engaging.\n\nOn 24 August 1804 \"Phoebe\" and captured \"Venscab\".\n\nOn 10 November \"Phoebe\" captured \"Cacciatore\". Then \"Phoebe\" and \"Hydra\" shared the proceeds from the capture between 9 and 15 November of the vessels \"Paulina\" and \"Sesostris\".\n\nThen, while Nelson was pursuing the French fleet from Toulon to the West Indies, Capel, in \"Phoebe\", was in charge of a small squadron of five frigates and two bomb vessels with the mission of covering Sicily, Sardinia and the route to Egypt. \"Phoebe\" joined the blockade of Cadiz later in the summer.\n\nThe arrival of the additional frigates \"Phoebe\", , , , and off Cadiz allowed Nelson to detach them to disrupt local shipping supplying provisions for the Franco-Spanish Combined Fleet in Cadiz.\n\nIn October, the frigate squadron was acting as the eyes of the British fleet. When the Combined Fleet put to sea on 19 October, \"Phoebe\" was first in line, followed by \"Naiad\" and the third rate . Capel spotted the Combined Fleet's exit and notified Nelson. As the combined fleet approached the British over the next couple of days, the frigates shadowed it, reporting on its movements.\n\nDuring the subsequent Battle of Trafalgar, \"Phoebe\" relayed Nelson's signals to the rest of fleet, and remained close to the action although she did not actually engage the enemy. In the gale that followed a few days later and \"Phoebe\" assisted two of the prizes, and \"Bahama\", with the result that they were saved.\n\nIn January 1806 Captain James Oswald took command. \"Phoebe\" then served in the North Sea and the Channel. On 9 July \"Phoebe\", and were deployed to the Shetland Islands to find a French squadron reported to be destroying British and Russian fishing and merchant vessels in the Arctic. Although \"Phoebe\" met with no success, \"Blanche\" encountered and captured . \"Phoebe\" then sailed to the West Indies.\n\nOn 18 January 1808, \"Phoebe\" sailed for the Mediterranean. In April 1809 Captain Hassard Stackpoole took command for the Baltic.> Between 7 and 12 July, \"Phoebe\" captured the Russian vessels \"Saint Nicholas 1\" and \"Saint Nicholas 2\", and another vessel, name unknown. In August Captain James Hillyar replaced Stackpoole. On 6 January 1810 \"Phoebe\" sailed from Torbay for off the Île de Batz. Later she was in the Gulf of Livonia where her boats took numerous prizes.\n\nBetween March and July 1810 \"Phoebe\" underwent repairs at Plymouth. She then sailed for the East Indies on 18 July.\n\nBy 21 November \"Phoebe\" was off the island of Rodrigues preparing for a joint naval and military expedition to take the Île de France. The expedition arrived on 28 November and the French signed the capitulation on 3 December.\n\nIn March 1811, \"Phoebe\" survived two major hurricanes in the Indian Ocean. \"Phoebe\" the participated in the Battle of Tamatave, where she fought another \"Néréide\", under Captain Jean-François Lemaresquier. In the severe action the British captured \"Renommée\"; \"Néréide\" surrendered subsequently on the 25th at Tamatave. The British took both vessels into service, \"Néréide\" as and \"Renommée\" as .\n\n\"Phoebe\" suffered seven dead and 24 wounded. \"Néréide\" suffered some 130 men dead and wounded. In 1847 this battle earned \"Phoebe's\" surviving crew the clasp \"Off Tamatave 20 May 1811\" to the Naval General Service Medal.\n\nOn 3 August 1811, \"Phoebe\" joined the fleet involved in the invasion of Java. Lieutenant-general Sir Samuel Auchmuty was the military commander-in-chief, and Commodore William Robert Broughton of the 74-gun third rate was the naval commander-in-chief. Later, Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford took charge of the naval forces.\n\nOn 31 August Stopford detached the frigates , \"President\", and \"Phoebe\", and the sloop to take Cheribon, a seaport about 35 leagues east of Batavia. They arrived at dark on 3 September and the fort surrendered the next morning without a shot being fired.\n\nOn 11 September, all squadron re-embarked the seamen and marines that had landed, together with about 700 prisoners, including 237 Europeans. At 4 a.m. \"Nisus\" and \"Phoebe\" weighed and steered for Taggal, a port about 20 or 25 leagues further to the east. The next day \"Phoebe\" arrived off the harbour. Together with a landing party of seamen, marines, and some sepoys, Captain Hillyar took quiet possession of the fort and public stores.\n\n\"Phoebe\", \"Nisus\", \"President\", and joined Stopford with \"Scipion\" and on 14 September. The next day they sailed for Surabaya. On 17 September they anchored off Ledayo on the Java shore where three transports with 450 men joined them. There they learned that the Dutch and French had surrendered the day before. The troops landed two days later and took possession of the place on 20 September under the general terms of the capitulation.\n\nIn 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Java\" to all remaining survivors of the campaign. \"Phoebe\" arrived at Plymouth Dock on 18 January 1812 with dispatches from the East Indies.\n\nOn 9 April 1812 \"Phoebe\" sailed with a convoy for Quebec. She returned to Deal on 2 August. On 30 September she was in Plymouth, having brought dispatches from Halifax. She then underwent a refit.\n\nIn late December 1812, \"Phoebe\" captured two American schooners. One was the \"Vengeance\", an American letter of marquee 12-gun schooner from New York, bound to Bordeaux, laden with sugar and coffee. \"Vengeance\" arrived in Plymouth on 8 January. The Royal Navy took \"Vengeance\" into service as . \"Vengeance\" was closely followed by \"Hunter\", a privateer schooner, of 14 guns and 100 men. The capture of \"Hunter\" occurred on 23 December after a chase during which she threw 12 of her guns overboard. Earlier, \"Hunter\" had captured a transport and a brig from a convoy under the escort of hired armed cutter \"Nimrod\".\n\nA few days later, \"Phoebe\" was sailing off the Azores in the company of the 74-gun third rate , under the command of Francis Austen, the brother of the acclaimed novelist Jane Austen, together with . On 27 December they captured the American privateer schooner \"Swordfish\" of Gloucester, John Evans, master. \"Swordfish\" was 16 days out of Boston and had a crew of 82 men, and originally twelve 6-pounder guns. However, she had thrown 10 overboard during the chase, which took 11 hours and covered more than 100 miles.\n\nOn 18 March 1813 \"Phoebe\" left Portsmouth with a convoy for Brazil and the East Indies. On 6 July \"Phoebe\", the sloop-of-war , and sailed from Rio de Janeiro around Cape Horn to the Juan Fernández Islands. There, \"Racoon\" continued on to the fur trading outpost of Fort Astoria. \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" remained to search for the 36-gun . Hillyar was under orders to capture the \"Essex\" \"at all costs\".\n\nOn 8 February 1814 \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" arrived at Valparaíso, a neutral port, where \"Essex\" and her prizes were anchored. Having trapped \"Essex\" in the harbour, Hillyar waited six weeks for her to come out and thwarted all of the efforts of her captain, David Porter, to escape. Eventually, on 28 March, Porter attempted to break out of the harbour. A squall took off his main topmast and he attempted to return to harbour but \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" drove \"Essex\" into a nearby bay and defeated her in a short engagement. \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" also captured \"Essex's\" tender, \"Essex Junior\", the ex-British whaler \"Atlantic\".\n\nIn the engagement with \"Essex\", \"Phoebe\" had four men killed, including her first lieutenant, and seven men wounded. \"Cherub\" had one killed and three wounded, including her captain. The British reported that \"Essex\" had 24 killed and 45 wounded, though the Americans reported higher casualties. In 1847 the then surviving crew members of \"Phoebe\" and \"Cherub\" were awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \"Phoebe 28 March 1814\" and \"Cherub 28 March 1814\".\n\nOn 31 May \"Phoebe\" and \"Essex\" set sail for England, with Lieutenant Pearson of \"Phoebe\" commanding the prize crew on \"Essex\". On the way they stopped for some time in Rio de Janeiro. The two ships finally anchored in Plymouth sound on 13 November. The Admiralty promoted Pearson to Commander, and repaired \"Essex\", taking her into service as HMS \"Essex\".\n\nOn 19 June, \"Cherub\" recaptured near the Sandwich Islands. \"Sir Andrew Hammond\" was a whaler that Porter had captured and left at Nuka Hiva, together with other captured vessels, including the \"Greenwich\" and the former British letter-of-marque whaler, USS \"Seringapatam\", the whole being under the command of Lieutenant John M. Gamble USMC. When Gamble made preparations to leave the island, many of his party mutinied. Gamble and seven men (four unfit for duty) escaped and sailed \"Sir Andrew Hammond\" 2000 miles before they had the misfortune to meet up with \"Cherub\".\n\n\"Phoebe\" was paid off in 1814 and laid up at Plymouth in August 1815. Between January 1823 and October 1826 she was a receiving ship and slop ship. She became a hulk in 1826 at Plymouth. \"Phoebe\" was sold for breaking up to Joshua Crystall for £1,750 on 25 May 1841.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\n"}

It is composed of the elements \"uodal-\" meaning \"(noble) heritage\" and \"-rich\" meaning \"rich, powerful\". Attested from the 8th century as the name of Alamannic nobility, the name is popularly given from the high medieval period in reference to Saint Ulrich of Augsburg (canonized 993). The surname Ulrich is most prevalent in Germany and has the highest density in Switzerland. This last name was found in the United States around the year 1840. Most Americans with the last name were concentrated in Pennsylvania, which was home to many German immigrant communities. Nowadays in the United States, the name is distributed largely in the Pennsylvania-Ohio region .\n\nDocuments record the Old High German name \"Oadalrich\" or \"Uodalrich\" from the later 8th century in Alamannia.\nThe related name \"Adalric\" (Anglo-Saxon cognate \"Æthelric\") is attested from the 6th century (Athalaric King of the Ostrogoths; Æthelric of Bernicia).\nThe name of Agilolfing duke Odilo (fl. 709–748) may represent a short form of the name.\n\nCount Udalrich I (fl. 778–814), a son of Gerold of Vinzgau, founded the Alamannic Udalriching dynasty, ancestral to the counts of Bregenz.\nThe given name occurred frequently in the Alamannic Hunfriding dynasty in the 9th to 10th centuries; examples include Odalric, Count of Barcelona (fl. 850s) and Odalric, Count of Thurgau (fl. 920s). \nThe name is recorded in an Icelandic form as \"Óðalríkr\" only in the later medieval period.\n\nIn the Middle High German period the name generally commemorated Saint Ulrich, Bishop of Augsburg (c. 890 – 4 July 973), who twice defended Augsburg from attacks by Magyars. \n\nThe Swiss Reformer Ulrich Zwingli etymologized his given name as \"Huldrych\" (\"Huldricus, Huldaricus\"), i.e. \"rich in grace\".\nIn the wake of Zwingli, during the 16th century and well into the 18th century, it became a fashion -\nespecially for Protestant writers - to latinise the given name \"Ulrich\" as \"Huldricus\".\n\nThe name was popularly given in 20th-century Switzerland, especially from the 1940s to the 1960s, \npeaking at rank 16 in 1947, but dropping below rank 100 in 1972.\nIn Czechoslovakia, \"Oldřich \" was popularly given in the 1940s to 1950s, peaking at rank 18 during 1946–1951.\n\nThe German given name was adopted in Czech and Slovak as \"Oldřich\", \"Oldrich\" and in Scandinavian as \"Ulrik\", in Slovenian as \"Urh\", in Latvia as Uldis.\n\nCommon German hypocoristics are \"Uli\" or \"Ulli\" (Swiss \"Ueli\") and historically \"Utz\".

{"id": "2158646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158646", "title": "Double electron capture", "text": "Double electron capture\n\nDouble electron capture is a decay mode of an atomic nucleus. For a nuclide (\"A\", \"Z\") with number of nucleons \"A\" and atomic number \"Z\", double electron capture is only possible if the mass of the nuclide of (\"A\", \"Z\"−2) is lower.\n\nIn this mode of decay, two of the orbital electrons are captured via the weak interaction by two protons in the nucleus, forming two neutrons. Two neutrinos are emitted in the process. Since the protons are changed to neutrons, the number of neutrons increases by two, the number of protons \"Z\" decreases by two, and the atomic mass number \"A\" remains unchanged. By changing the number of protons, double electron capture transforms the nuclide into a new element.\n\nExample:\nIn most cases this decay mode is masked by other, more probable modes involving fewer particles, such as single electron capture. When all other modes are “forbidden” (strongly suppressed) double electron capture becomes the main mode of decay. There exist 34 naturally occurring nuclei that are believed to undergo double electron capture, but the process has been confirmed by observation in the decay of only three isotopes: krypton-78, barium-130, and xenon-124.\n\nOne reason is that the probability of double electron capture is stupendously small; the theoretical predictions of half-lives for this mode lie well above 10 years. A second reason is that the only detectable particles created in this process are X-rays and Auger electrons that are emitted by the excited atomic shell. In the range of their energies (~1–10 keV), the background is usually high. Thus, the experimental detection of double electron capture is more difficult than that for double beta decay.\n\nDouble electron capture can be accompanied by the excitation of the daughter nucleus. Its de-excitation, in turn, is accompanied by an emission of photons with energies of hundreds of keV.\n\nIf the mass difference between the mother and daughter atoms is more than two masses of an electron (1.022 MeV), the energy released in the process is enough to allow another mode of decay, called electron capture with positron emission. It occurs along with double electron capture, their branching ratio depending on nuclear properties.\n\nWhen the mass difference is more than four electron masses (2.044 MeV), the third mode, called double positron decay, is allowed. Only six naturally occurring nuclides can decay via these three modes simultaneously.\n\nThe above-described process with the capture of two electrons and emission of two neutrinos (two-neutrino double electron capture) is allowed by the Standard Model of particle physics: No conservation laws (including lepton number conservation) are violated. However, if the lepton number is not conserved, or the neutrino is its own antiparticle, another kind of process can occur: the so-called neutrinoless double electron capture. In this case, two electrons are captured by nucleus, but neutrinos are not emitted. The energy released in this process is carried away by an internal bremsstrahlung gamma quantum.\n\nExample:\n\nThis mode of decay has never been observed experimentally, and would contradict the Standard Model if it were observed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2158672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158672", "title": "John and Mary", "text": "John and Mary\n\nJohn and Mary are the subjects of a series of children's books written by Grace James. The series started in the 1930s and finishes in the 1960s. They form part of the 'realistic adventure' tradition in children's literature, following on from similar works by E. Nesbit and Arthur Ransome.\n\nThe stories are set mainly in the Berkshire countryside, at the farmhouse home of the children's grandmother, a Scottish-born woman named Mrs Hawthorne. The farm is called Smockfarthing, and is near to an imaginary village called Smockfarthing Wick, which in turn is close to a town called Riverton. Although these names are invented, they are based on real places - Smockfarthing is actually a house called Stonehill House, and Riverton is Abingdon. The house is mainly inhabited by John, Mary and their aunt 'Push', as well as their grandmother, and they are all real people - Push is Grace James herself, 'Mrs Hawthorne' is her mother, and John and Mary (or Giovanni and Maria) are her nephew and niece. John and Mary's parents live in Rome, as their father is Italian and works there apparently as a diplomat (his work is described in \"John and Mary Revisit Rome\" as \"involving a great deal of travelling about to far-off places\") - he is married to John and Mary's mother, Push's sister (their real names were Henry and Elspeth Cavalletti). John and Mary are educated at home by a governess called Miss Rose Brown, although they spend about half their time in Rome, and indeed are bilingual in English and Italian. Smockfarthing carries a full complement of servants, including Mrs. Dyer the cook, Ellen the parlourmaid, Lizzie (whom the children call Lisetta) the maid, and Edie Kittiwake, the nurse. Edie's father Kittiwake looks after the farm with his son Reggie, and they and Mrs. Kittiwake live in a house on the farm called the Round House. Other characters, such as schoolmasters, vicars, postmistresses and so on, crop up in the books from time to time as well.\n\nAlthough the series covers about thirty years, John and Mary are never allowed to grow up (only from about the ages of four to twelve) and nothing ever changes very much in their surroundings. This leads to situations such as the war and rationing being discussed during the 1940s, and television and washing machines being mentioned in the 1960s. (One can only assume that Grace James wished to appeal to a constantly fresh readership, although children of the 1960s could possibly have found it rather odd that John and Mary would still have a governess and maids running around after them, in that era.)\n\nThe John and Mary stories involve the children doing fairly normal and day-to-day things within their environment (mainly the countryside), although James makes sure that they meet unusual people and have adventures along the way. The stories are written in a realistic way and the adventures are the kind of adventures that any children could have under the same circumstances.\n\n\"John and Mary's Aunt \" is not about John and Mary at all, but is about James herself and her upbringing as a child in Japan. We learn that she was born in Tokyo and lived there until she was about twelve, although no exact dates are given. She does mention that her father was part of a naval mission and was there as an instructor - this seems to fit in with the time of the 'Douglas Mission' to Japan, which commenced in 1873 (hence the photographs in the book of her and her siblings in Victorian children's clothing).\n\nThe books were published by Frederick Muller and were illustrated by Mary Gardiner.\n\n\n\n\n"}

With the reforms, they returned from exile or were released from prison and formed the Islamic Action Society.\n\nAs with the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the party's spiritual leader is Iraqi cleric Hādī al-Mudarrisī, who was given asylum in Bahrain in the 1970s and acquired Bahraini citizenship while preaching religious awareness. He was though expelled to Iran after he set up the Front, but in 1981 he attempted to return to Bahrain as the head of a theocratic government in a failed coup d'état.\n\nThe Front was accused by the government for a series of terror attacks on civilian targets in the 1990s including a bomb attack on the Diplomat Hotel in Manama in 1996 injuring four people. A spokesman claiming responsibility for the bombings told the Associated Press \"We put a bomb in the Diplomat hotel 20 minutes ago ... after the feast ... tell the government that we will destroy everyplace.\"\nThe party often calls for public demonstrations and political seminars focusing on the issues affecting the majority Shīʻa, who have been ruled by the minority Sunnis for many decades. In September 2005, its license was temporarily suspended after a crowded festival was held honouring those imprisoned by the government on suspicion of involvement in an alleged 1981 coup. The party resumed activities after the temporary suspension.\n\nThe current president of the party is Shaykh Muħammad ʻAlī al-Mahfūð, a longtime opposition figure and a close aid to \"Āyatu l-Lāh\" al-Mudarrisī. Its vice-president is Salah al-Khawāja.\n\nWhile the party was allied with fellow Shīʻa Islamists al Wefaq, although the relationship was difficult: Shaykh al-Mahfūð said that attempts were being made by ʻAlī Salman and others to marginalise the party into its \"Shirāzī base\". The Islamic Action demanded al-Wefaq's support in several constituencies in the 2006 election, although the Islamic Action's spokesman Jawad ʻAbdu l-Waħab has said that no decision has yet been made because they want although it took part anyway. This led one commentator to accuse the party of having a stance \"based on self-serving interests but under glossy principles to boost its prestige\". Discussion about participation in elections prompted Vice President Salah Khawaja to resign from the party in March 2006 and announce his retirement from politics.\n\nBefore February 2011, Islamic Action Society decided to support the Bahraini uprising. During February and March 2011, many representatives of Amal joined anti-Monarchy protesters in Lulu Square and vowed not to enter any dialogue until King Hamad relinquished his office. As a result, the government arrested all the prominent leaders of Amal and closed its headquarters, dissolving the party.\n\n"}

Reaching only No. 34 in the UK Albums Chart, \"Rock 'N' Roll\" was, in that respect, the worst performing of all of Motörhead's Top 40 chart hits.\n\nIt would see the return of 'classic line up' drummer \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, albeit only for a few more years before being fired.\n\nIn 1987, Motörhead appeared in the Peter Richardson film \"Eat the Rich\", which starred the regular cast of \"The Comic Strip\" and Motörhead bassist/vocalist Lemmy Kilmister himself in a small part as \"Spider\". The band supplied six songs for the soundtrack as well. As the band was about to film their cameo, however, drummer Pete Gill was fired and Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor rejoined after having quit in 1984. In his autobiography \"White Line Fever\", Lemmy states the sacking of Gill was a long time coming:\n\nLemmy adds that he knew Taylor, who had been playing with Frankie Miller and ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian \"Robbo\" Robertson, wanted to come back. \"Rock 'N' Roll\" would be the final album recorded by Motörhead on the GWR label and the last before Lemmy would relocate from the UK to Los Angeles.\n\n\"Rock 'N' Roll\" was produced by the band and Guy Bidmead at Master Rock Studios and Redwood Studios in London. In the Motörhead documentary \"The Guts and the Glory\", guitarist Phil Campbell states, \"I like it. It's not a great album but... there's things on there I like, a lot of good things I like.\" \n\nCampbell adds that the studio manager informed them that the studio they were recording in was owned by Michael Palin, and Motörhead – who were all huge Monty Python fans – invited Palin to come down and do a recitation for the album. Palin showed up dressed in a 1940s cricketer outfit, with a V-necked sweater and his hair all brushed to one side. Lemmy remembers Palin walking in and saying, \"Hello, what sort of thing are we going to do now, then?\" and Lemmy answering \"Well, you know in \"The Meaning of Life\", there was this speech that began 'Oh Lord — .'\" Palin replied \"Ah! Give me some cathedral!\" and went in and recorded the 'Oh Lord, look down upon these people from Motörhead' speech.\n\nThe song \"Eat the Rich\" was written specifically for the Richardson film and a music video was released as well (in addition to Lemmy, Koo Stark, Bill Wyman, and Paul McCartney also appear in the film).\n\nIn his 2002 memoir, Lemmy assesses the album:\nAs with the previous two albums it was not a commercial success, even though Lemmy had appeared in a comedy film by the same name as the single, and the sound track to, \"Eat The Rich\". It continued the downwards momentum of the band into the late eighties, with no original release until 1991, when they made the \"1916\" album.\n\nLemmy also writes that \"Rock 'N' Roll\" has some great songs, like \"Dogs,\" \"Boogeyman,\" and \"Traitor\", which they played \"for years,\" but overall it just didn't seem to work. According to Joel McIver's 2011 Motörhead biography \"Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead\", a court case between the band and GWR was sparked over the choice of a summer single in 1988; the band wanted to release a live performance of \"Traitor\" from \"Rock 'N' Roll\" that was recorded at the Giants of Rock Festival in Hameenlinna, Finland, while the label had wanted to put out a live rendition of the Motörhead classic \"Ace of Spades\".\n\nJoe Petagno had other ideas for the cover of this album:\n\nWhile calling Motörhead \"a rock & roll band in the purest sense,\" Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic concedes: \n\nIn 2011 Motörhead biographer Joel McIver wrote: \n\"Rock 'N' Roll\" renewed commercial hope for Motörhead in the United States, with Lemmy moving to Los Angeles after the recording of this album permanently. The fans in the States appeared willing to see this band live and buy their albums whereas Britain is criticised as having lost interest in Motörhead.\n\n\nDisc one is the original album without bonus tracks. B1–B2 tracks B-Side to \"Eat the Rich\" 12\" single. B3–B15 are the live performance at the Monsters of Rock, Donington Park, England on 16 August 1986, BBC Radio 1 broadcast on the Friday Rock Show\n\nPer the \"Rock 'N' Roll\" liner notes.\n\n\"Eat the Rich\" originally recorded by Bill Laswell – recording (\"Eat the Rich\")\n\n\n"}

Lymexylidae belong to the suborder Polyphaga and are the sole member of the superfamily Lymexyloidea.\n\n\"Lymexylon\", \"Elateroides\", and \"Melittomma\" are pests to forest trees such as chestnut, poplar, and oak, and can be found worldwide. Some species are parasitic, causing decay in living trees and damaging timber structures such as houses and ships. Wood boring activities occur primarily in the larva stage, with the larvae damaging both sapwood and heartwood. Lymexylidae larvae bore into living and decaying wood (e.g. Chestnut, Populus, and Oak) where they consume the fungus \"Endomyces hylecoeti\".\n\nLymexylidae larvae have a symbiotic association with certain types of fungi. The fungi grow in sheltered environments where they are tended by the larvae, such as the holes burrowed into the wood and, in return, the larvae feed on the fungi.\nSpecifically, this species has evolved a relationship with the yeast-like fungus \"Endomyces hylecoeti\". Every egg the female lays is coated with fungal spores from a pouch near her ovipositor. The larvae hatch and subsequently collect some of the spores by remaining close to the egg shells for a period of time, before tunneling further into the wood. The fungi grow on the tunnel walls created by the larvae. The larvae then consume the fungus, rather than the wood itself. As the fungi require air flow to grow, the larvae ensure the tunnels are free of any debris.\n\nLymexylidae contain the following genera:\n\n\nThere are over 60 species in these genera, including:\n\nAdult morphology: \n\nImmature Morphology: \n\nThe superfamily Lymexyloidea is currently within series Cucujoidea. The internal phylogeny has not been clearly understood/completed by experts. Morphological data places the family inside the Tenebrionoidea, while molecular data place it as sister taxon to Tenebrionoidea, and polyphyletic.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158693", "title": "Repository for Germinal Choice", "text": "Repository for Germinal Choice\n\nThe Repository for Germinal Choice (originally named the Hermann J. Muller Repository for Germinal Choice, after Nobel laureate Hermann Joseph Muller) was a sperm bank that operated in Escondido, California from 1980 to 1999. The repository is commonly believed to have accepted only donations from recipients of the Nobel Prize, although in fact it accepted donations from non-Nobelists, also. The first baby conceived from the project was a girl born on April 19, 1982. Founded by Robert Klark Graham, the repository was dubbed the \"Nobel prize sperm bank\" by media reports at the time. The only contributor who became known publicly was William Shockley, Nobel laureate in physics.\n\nRobert Graham managed the bank until his death in February 1997 and the responsibilities were passed to Floyd Kimble, a businessman from Ohio who had shown interest in the bank. At the time of Graham's death, the bank claimed to have produced 229 children, none of them from sperm donated from Graham's initial focus, Nobel Prize winners. When Kimble died in 1998 the combined relatives of both men decided to close down the bank. All sperm samples were destroyed; it remains unclear what happened to the Repository's records.\n\nAlthough most news articles of the time made much of the Repository's \"Nobel sperm\" standards, in fact the Repository is only known to have stocked the sperm of one Nobelist, William Shockley. Other donors were recruited from among the ranks of scientists and academics Graham and his assistant, Paul Smith, considered to be \"the future Nobel laureates\".\n\nGraham's initial attempts to recruit Nobel laureates who lived near the Repository yielded only three volunteers, Shockley among them; however, when the news media began reporting on the existence and intentions of the Repository, two of the laureates broke off their ties to Graham and did not donate. Only Shockley remained, and even he donated only once. Paul Smith was charged with recruiting new donors, and he traveled throughout California, focusing mainly on college campuses, in search of volunteers. Smith later estimated his \"hit rate\" of donors signed up compared to men he invited to be \"six or eight, maybe ten\" out of one hundred. The search was expanded to country-wide, and eventually more donors were recruited, although none of them were – then or currently – Nobel laureates. At the time of his death, Graham had expanded his requirements to allow athletes, artists, and businessmen as donors.\n\nOne donor named Jason Kaiser, known as Orange Red at the repository, was featured in the 2003 documentary \"Genius Sperm Bank\", which the Discovery Channel broadcast in 2004. The documentary briefly touched upon his viewpoints at the time, and reunited him with three of the nine children that reputedly had resulted from his donations. Although not a Nobel laureate, Kaiser did achieve a master of science degree in cytogenetics.\n\nPaul F. Kisak was also featured in the documentary, in what appears to be, the last attempt to recruit a donor. Kisak was instrumental in supplying the documentation to author David Plotz, that was given to him when he met with Dr. Graham.\n\nAs with the Repository's criteria to accept sperm donors, its criteria for women to receive sperm from the bank were not as high as initially reported. Rumors that women were required to be members of Mensa were false; in fact, women did not need to meet any particular intellectual requirement. Essentially, any woman who was married, in good health, and not homosexual was accepted; the only women reported to have been refused sperm were \"one [woman] who took lithium, [and] another who was obese and diabetic.\"\n\nGraham's original intention was to monitor the outcomes of children produced through the bank's sperm, and he asked families using the bank's sperm to agree to periodic surveys; however, most recipients showed no interest in sharing information on their children once the procedure was over, and when he sent out a survey to recipient families in the early 1990s, few families responded. Two women who claimed to have been the recipients of Repository sperm and to have raised children born of that sperm responded anonymously to a series of articles in \"Slate\" in 2001. Both stated that their children were extremely intelligent and healthy.\n\nA later segment of the same \"Slate\" article reported on the highlights of the lives of fifteen of the resultant children. Of the fifteen, six reportedly had 4.0 GPAs and two were reported to be \"artistically precocious\". Still others were reported to be \"geniuses\" and \"whizzes\" at various disciplines. All the children contacted by \"Slate\" were in good health, except one, who had what his mother described as a \"developmental disability\".\n\nJournalist David Plotz wrote several articles on the repository for the online magazine, \"Slate\". Plotz would later write a book about his experiences investigating the repository in the book \"The Genius Factory: The Curious History of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank\" (2005). Moreover, a documentary, which aired on BBC Horizon in 2006, went over the history of the Repository and various statements made by Graham. The program also featured discussion from another donor, University of Central Oklahoma biology professor James Bidlack.\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\"'s pilot episode satirizes the repository when Leonard and Sheldon visit the \"high-IQ sperm bank,\" intending to donate specimens, only to leave after Sheldon suffers a moral crisis over committing \"genetic fraud\" by donating sperm that may not produce the promised genius offspring.\n\nEpisode 5 of \"This is Life with Lisa Ling\" focused on the sperm bank, interviewing people who donated, people who went to the sperm bank seeking donated sperm, and people who were born as a result.\n\nThe German novel \"Fast Genial\" (\"Almost Genius\") by Benedict Wells tells the story of a fictitious child produced by the sperm bank, who searches for his biological father.\n\n\n\n"}

It was based upon their earlier RWD 2 design, but enlarged and fitted with more powerful inline engine. It retained the same fish-shaped fuselage without a direct view forward from the pilot's seat, though the view improved due to thin fuselage profile before the pilot. Also a silhouette became slimmer. The aircraft development was ordered by the Ministry of Communication especially for participation in the Challenge 1930 international air competition. At the same time, the RWD developed similar liaison aircraft project, the RWD 3, which shared many features with the RWD 4.\n\nThe first three aircraft (registration SP-ADK, -ADL and -ADM) were completed and flown by the designer Jerzy Drzewiecki in early 1930. In late 1930, a further six aircraft were built for the Polish Aero Club (registration SP-AEK, -AEL, AEY, -AEZ, -AFC, -AGP).\n\nThe first three aircraft took part in the Challenge 1930 competition in July. Only Jerzy Bajan completed the race on SP-ADM on the 32nd place (of 35 classified and 60 starting crews).

She then took a family hostage and shot another man, non-fatally, before killing herself.\n\nDann was born in Chicago and grew up in Glencoe, a north suburb of Chicago. She was the daughter of an accountant, Norman Wasserman, and his wife, Edith Joy.\n\nThose who knew Dann described her as shy and withdrawn. She graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, in 1975, and although she had poor grades in high school she was able to attend Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. When her grades improved, she transferred to the University of Arizona with the goal of becoming a teacher. She began dating a pre-med student, and the relationship soon became serious, but she was becoming possessive and demanding. In the summer of 1977 she attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, taking a course in home economics.\n\nIn 1980, with the relationship failing, Dann moved back to her parents' home. She then transferred to Northwestern University to complete her degree, but she dropped out of all her classes and never graduated.\n\nShe met and married Russell Dann, an executive in an insurance broker firm in September 1982, but the marriage quickly soured as Russell's family noted signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder and strange behavior including leaving trash around the house. She saw a psychiatrist for a short period, who identified her childhood and upbringing as a cause of her problems.\n\nLaurie and Russell Dann separated in October 1985. The divorce negotiations were acrimonious, with Laurie claiming that Russell was abusive. In the following months, the police were called to investigate various incidents, including several harassing phone calls made to Russell and his family. In April 1986, Laurie Dann accused Russell of breaking into and vandalizing her parents' house, where she was then living. Shortly after, she purchased a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum, telling the salesman that she needed it for self-defense. The police were concerned about her gun ownership and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Dann and her family that she should give up the gun.\n\nIn August 1986, she contacted her ex-boyfriend, who was by then a resident at a hospital, and claimed to have had his child. When he refused to believe her, Dann called the hospital where he worked and claimed he had raped her in the emergency room.\n\nIn September 1986, Russell Dann reported he had been stabbed in his sleep with an icepick. He accused Laurie of the crime, although he had not actually seen his attacker. The police decided not to press charges against Laurie based on a medical report which suggested that the injury might have been self-inflicted, as well as Russell's abrasive attitude towards the police and his failed polygraph test. Russell and his family continued to receive harassing hang-up phone calls, and Laurie was arrested for calls made to Russell's sister. The charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.\n\nJust before their divorce was finalized in April 1987, Laurie accused Russell of raping her. There were no physical signs supporting Laurie's claim, although she passed two polygraph tests. In May 1987, Laurie accused Russell of placing an incendiary device in her home. No charges were filed against Russell for either alleged event. Laurie's parents believed her claims and supported and defended her throughout. By this time, Laurie Dann was being treated by another psychiatrist for obsessive-compulsive disorder and a \"chemical imbalance\"; the psychiatrist told police that he did not think Laurie was suicidal or homicidal.\n\nDann worked as a babysitter, and some employers were happy with the care she provided their children. Others made complaints to the police about damage to their furniture and the theft of food and clothes. Despite the complaints, no charges were pressed. Dann's father did pay for damages in one case.\n\nIn the summer of 1987, Dann sublet a university apartment in Evanston, Illinois. Once again, her strange behavior was noted, including riding up and down in elevators for hours, wearing rubber gloves to touch metal, and leaving meat to rot in sofa cushions. She took no classes at the university.\n\nIn the fall of 1987, Dann claimed she had received threatening letters from Russell and that he had sexually assaulted her in a parking lot, but the police did not believe her. A few weeks later, she purchased a .32-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver.\n\nWith her condition deteriorating, Dann and her family sought specialized help. In November 1987, she moved to Madison, Wisconsin, to live in a student residence while being observed by a psychiatrist who specialized in obsessive-compulsive disorder. She had already begun taking clomipramine, a drug for OCD, and her new psychiatrist increased the dosage, adding lithium carbonate to reduce her mood swings and initiating behavioral therapy to work on her phobias and ritualistic behaviors. Despite the intervention, her strange behavior continued, including riding elevators for long periods, changing television channels repetitively, and an obsession with \"good\" and \"bad\" numbers. There were also concerns about whether she was bulimic.\n\nDann purchased a .22 semi-automatic Beretta at the end of December 1987. In March 1988, she stopped attending her appointments with the psychiatrist and behavior therapist. At about the same time, she began to make preparations for the attacks. She stole books from the library on poisons, and she diluted arsenic and other chemicals from a lab. She also shoplifted clothes and wigs to disguise herself and was arrested for theft on one occasion. Both her psychiatrist and her father tried to persuade her to enter the hospital as an inpatient, but she refused.\n\nDann continued to make numerous hang-up phone calls to her former in-laws and babysitting clients. Eventually, the calls escalated to death threats. An ex-boyfriend and his wife also received dozens of threatening calls. In May 1988, a letter, later confirmed to have been sent by Laurie Dann, was sent to the hospital administration where her ex-boyfriend then worked, again accusing him of sexual assault. Since the phone calls were across state lines, the FBI became involved, and a federal indictment against Dann was prepared. However, the ex-boyfriend, fearful of publicity, and concerned about Dann getting bail and then attempting to fulfill her threats against him, decided to wait until other charges were filed in Illinois. In May 1988, a janitor found her lying in the fetal position inside a garbage bag in a trash room. This precipitated a search of her room and her departure back to Glencoe.\n\nDuring the days before May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann prepared rice cereal snacks and juice boxes poisoned with the diluted arsenic she had stolen in Madison. She mailed them to a former acquaintance, ex-babysitting clients, her psychiatrist, Russell Dann, and others. In the early morning of May 20, she personally delivered snacks and juice \"samples\" to acquaintances, and families for whom she had babysat, some of whom had not seen her for years. Other snacks were delivered to Alpha Tau Omega, Psi Upsilon, and Kappa Sigma fraternity houses and Leverone Hall at Northwestern University in Evanston. Notes were attached to some of the deliveries. The drinks were often leaking and the squares unpleasant-tasting, so few were actually consumed. In addition, the arsenic was highly diluted so nobody became seriously ill.\n\nAt about 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, Dann arrived at the home of the Rushe family, former babysitting clients in Winnetka, Illinois, to pick up their two youngest children. The family had just told Dann they were moving away. Instead of taking the children on the promised outing, she took them to Ravinia Elementary School in Highland Park, Illinois, where she erroneously believed that both of her former sister-in-law's two sons were enrolled (in fact, one of Dann's intended targets was not even a student at the school). She left the two children in the car while she entered the school and tried to detonate a fire bomb in one of the school's hallways. After Dann's departure, the small fire she set was subsequently discovered by students, and quickly extinguished by a teacher. She drove to a local daycare attended by her ex-sister-in-law's daughter and tried to enter the building with a plastic can of gasoline, but was stopped by staff.\n\nNext Dann drove the children back to their home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, but the boys spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to set fire to the house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape). She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. She wandered into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a .22 semi-automatic Beretta pistol. Her Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm. Dann then reentered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into the corner of the room. The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a .32 Smith & Wesson from the waistband of her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nick Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car.\n\nDann was prevented from leaving the area by car because the roads were closed for a funeral cortege. She decided to drive her car backwards down the nearby street, but the road dead-ended into a private drive. Abandoning her car, she removed her bloodstained shorts and tied a blue garbage bag around her waist. With her two remaining guns she made her way through the woods and came upon the house of the Andrew family. Dann entered the house and met a mother and her twenty-year-old son, who were in the kitchen. She claimed she was raped and had shot the rapist in the struggle.\nThe Andrews were sympathetic and tried to convince her that she need not fear the police because she had acted in self-defense. Mrs. Andrew gave Dann a pair of her daughter's pants to wear. While she was putting them on, Philip Andrew was able to pick up and pocket the Beretta. He suggested that she call her family. Dann agreed and called her mother, telling her she had done something terrible and that the police were involved. Philip took the phone and explained Dann's story about the rape and shooting, suggesting that Mrs. Wasserman come to get Dann; Mrs. Wasserman said she could not come because she did not have a car.\n\nMr. Andrew arrived home, and they continued to argue with Dann, insisting she give up the second gun. Dann called her mother again and this time Mr. Andrew spoke with Mrs. Wasserman, asking her to persuade Dann to give up the gun. While Dann spoke with her mother, Mrs. Andrew left the house and alerted the police. Mr. Andrew told Dann that he would not remain in the house if she did not put down the gun, and also left the house. Dann ordered Philip to stay. Just before noon, seeing the police advancing on the house she shot Philip in the chest, but he managed to escape out the back door before collapsing and being rescued by the police and ambulance personnel.\n\nWith the house surrounded, Dann went upstairs to a bedroom. The Wassermans and Russell Dann were brought to the house. At about 7:00 p.m., an assault team entered the house while Mr. Wasserman attempted to get Dann's attention with a bullhorn. The police found her body in the bedroom; she had shot herself in the mouth.\n\nAll but one of the victims wounded by Dann recovered from their injuries, including the schoolgirl who was shot and suffered severe internal injuries. The victims, school children, and parents received extensive support to help them cope with the psychological after-effects of the attacks.\n\nParents and members of the community subsequently devoted many years to gun control policy. Philip Andrew gave interviews about gun control from his hospital bed, and later became active in local and state gun control organizations as the executive director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; he subsequently became a lawyer and then an FBI agent.\n\nThe Dann shootings also fueled the debate about criteria for committing mentally ill people to mental health facilities against their will. Some favored the involuntary commitment of a person who is determined to be mentally ill and incapable of making informed decisions about treatment; civil libertarians like Benjamin Wolf (staff counsel for the ACLU of Illinois) opposed the idea saying, \"It would be a shame if we cut back on the civil liberties of literally millions of mentally ill people because of the occasional bizarre incident.\"\n\nA book called \"Murder of Innocence\" was written by Eric Zorn about the tragedy, and a made-for-television film of the same name was based on it. In the film, Dann's name is changed to Laurie Wade. She was played by Valerie Bertinelli. Russell Dann helped coach Bertinelli while she was preparing for the role. \n\nSome blamed Dann's family for defending and protecting her in spite of the signs of her deteriorating mental health. Investigations were hampered by the Wassermans' refusal to be interviewed by police or to provide access to Dann's psychiatric records—the records were eventually obtained by court order. On the night of Dann's death, the Wassermans allowed only a very brief search of her bedroom, after which they cleaned it and removed potential evidence. The police were criticized for not sealing off Dann's room as part of the crime scene. Parents of the shooting victims subsequently sued the Wasserman family for damages.\n\nFurther criticism was directed at Dann's psychiatrists for failing to identify or take action regarding the signs of Dann's decreasing mental stability. At the time of her suicide, Dann was taking an unlicensed drug clomipramine. The effects of this drug were initially considered as contributing factors to Dann's mental well-being, but ultimately ruled out.\n\nTwo newspaper clippings were found among Dann's possessions after her death. One described a man who randomly killed two people in a public building. The other described a depressed young man who had attempted to commit suicide in the same way that Dann did; he survived and discovered that his brain injury had cured him of his obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nOne theory of Dann's rationale was that she targeted people who had \"disappointed\" her in some way: her ex-husband, her former sister-in-law (through the firebombing attempts at her children's schools and daycare), her ex-boyfriend and his wife, the family who was moving away, as well as former friends and babysitting clients.\n\nDann was also briefly investigated as a possible suspect in the Chicago Tylenol murders, but no direct connection was found.\n\nIn his book \"The Myth of Male Power\", author Warren Farrell suggested that Laurie Dann's actions were an example of women's violence against men. He claimed, erroneously, that all of Dann's victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist. Men's rights activists, academics, and the media have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion. Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.\n"}

He published many emerging American and European writers.\n\nThayer was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on 12 December 1889 to Edward D. Thayer and Florence (née Scofield) Thayer. The Thayers were a prominent and wealthy Massachusetts family. Scofield's father was the owner of several area woollen mills, a founding investor in the Crompton & Thayer Loom Company, and a director of the Worcester Trust Company. Scofield's uncle Ernest Thayer was the author of the well-known poem \"Casey at the Bat\".\n\nThayer was a Harvard University student. His Harvard years would prove formative; during them Thayer would serve on the staff of the \"Harvard Monthly\". During these years Thayer would also meet many other young poets and authors, including E. E. Cummings, Alan Seeger, Lincoln MacVeagh, Arthur Wilson (later known as Winslow Wilson) and Gilbert Seldes. A large dormitory for freshmen at Harvard, in which E. E. Cummings once roomed (room 306), is named after the Thayer family. Thayer graduated from Harvard in 1913. After Harvard, Thayer went to Oxford for post-graduate studies at the same time as T. S. Eliot.\n\nThayer married Elaine Orr on 21 June 1916. He commissioned his friend E. E. Cummings to write his poem \"Epithalamion\" as a wedding present. The marriage did not last long, however, and Thayer moved to his own place. By 1919 Elaine was having an affair with Cummings, giving birth to their daughter, Nancy, in December of that year.\n\nThayer's involvement with \"The Dial\" began in April 1918 when he purchased $600 USD worth of stock in the magazine. In late 1919, Thayer and his fellow Harvard alumnus Dr. James Sibley Watson, Jr. purchased \"The Dial\" from the owner, Martyn Johnson, who was suffering financial trouble. Dr. Watson became the magazine's president while Thayer took up the post of editor. The new team produced its first issue of \"Dial\" in January 1920. The issue featured works from E. E. Cummings, Gaston Lachaise, Arthur Wilson (Winslow Wilson) and Carl Sandburg.\n\nIn July 1921, Thayer sailed for Europe. He settled in Vienna, and, although he would remain there for more than two years, he continued to direct the operations of \"The Dial\". He solicited financial backing from European investors and sent layout and content instructions back to the magazine's offices in New York regularly. While in Vienna he was psychoanalysed by Sigmund Freud.\n\nDuring the mid-1920s Thayer began to suffer a series of mental breakdowns, and began to deteriorate. He resigned as editor of \"The Dial\" in June 1926, and spent the remainder of his life in the care of relatives and various institutions and sanatoria. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Watson continued with \"The Dial\", working with editor Marianne Moore. Their final issue was published in July 1929.\n\nThayer was certified insane in 1937, the year after his mother died. He thenceforth lived the secluded life of a rich man, surrounded by servants, and moving among homes in Bermuda, Florida, Boston, and his family home on Martha's Vineyard.\n\nHe died on 9 July 1982 at the age of 93, leaving a bequest of 400 items from his art collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He left his Aubrey Beardsley collection of drawings to the Fogg Art Museum. He is buried in Rural Cemetery in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n"}

His prosecution by the McCarran Security Committee led to his move to England, where he became an English classical scholar and eventually master of Darwin College, Cambridge. His most notable work is \"The Ancient Economy\" (1973), where he argued that the economy in antiquity was governed by status and civic ideology rather than rational economic motivations.\n\nFinley was born in 1912 in New York City to Nathan Finkelstein and Anna Katzenellenbogen. About 1946, he took the surname Finley.\n\nHe was educated at Syracuse University, where, aged fifteen, he graduated \"magna cum laude\" in psychology, and at Columbia University. Although his M.A. was in public law, most of his published work was in the field of ancient history, especially the social and economic aspects of the classical world.\n\nFinley taught at Columbia University and City College of New York, where he was influenced by members of the Frankfurt School who were working in exile in America. He then taught at Rutgers University.\n\nOn 5 September 1951, Dr Karl Wittfogel stated that Finley was a communist while testifying before HUAC. On 28 March 1952, Professor Finley appeared before HUAC and invoked the Fifth Amendment regarding connections to communism. On 26–7 September 1952, Lewis Webster Jones, president of Rutgers University, announced his intention to appoint Trustee and Faculty committees to review the cases of professors involved in government inquiries. On 15 November 1952, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover met with Jones to discuss the cases. On 12 December 1952, Rutger's Board of Trustees resolution declared that, \"It shall be cause for immediate dismissal of any member of faculty or staff\" to fail to co-operate with government inquiries. On 31 December 1952, Rutgers fired Finley. Rutgers University records show that: On 3 December 1952, the Special Faculty Committee issued a report stating there should be no charges against Heimlich or Finley and that the University should take no further action in the matter. However, the Trustees, who had final say in the matter, issued a resolution on 12 December 1952, stating \"it shall be cause for immediate dismissal of any member of faculty or staff\" who invokes the fifth amendment before an investigatory body in refusing to answer questions relating to Communist affiliation, and that Professors Heimlich and Finley would be dismissed as of December of 31, 1952 unless they conformed to this new policy. Neither chose to do so. There was protest to this decision by members of the faculty, who formed an Emergency Committee on the matter.\n\nIn 1954, he appeared before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security (SISS), which asked him whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party USA. He again invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer.\n\nFinley immigrated to Britain, where he was appointed university lecturer in classics at Cambridge (1955–1964) and, in 1957, elected to a fellowship at Jesus College. He was reader in ancient social and economic history (1964–1970), professor of ancient history (1970–1979) and master of Darwin College (1976–1982).\n\nHe broadened the scope of classical studies from philology to culture, economics, and society. He became a British subject in 1962 and a Fellow of the British Academy in 1971, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1979. He was a doctorate adviser to Paul Millett, now a senior lecturer in Classics at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAmong his works, \"The World of Odysseus\" (1954, revised ed. with additional essays 1978) proved seminal. In it, he applied the findings of ethnologists and anthropologists like Marcel Mauss to illuminate Homer, a radical approach that was thought by his publishers to require a reassuring introduction by an established classicist, Maurice Bowra. Paul Cartledge asserted in 1995, \"... in retrospect Finley's work can be seen as the seed of the present flowering of anthropologically-related studies of ancient Greek culture and society\".\n\nFollowing the example of Karl Polanyi, Finley argued that the ancient economy should not be analysed using the concepts of modern economic science, because ancient man had no notion of the economy as a separate sphere of society, and because economic actions in antiquity were determined not primarily by economic, but by social concerns. This text later came under scrutiny, with varied criticism coming from, amongst others, Kevin Greene,\nwho argues that Finley underplays the importance of technological innovation, and C. R. Whittaker,\nwho rejects the concept of a \"consumer city\".\n\nIn 1932 Finley married Mary (, who later changed to her mother's surname, Thiers), a schoolteacher, and the two enjoyed a happy and mutually reinforcing, albeit childless marriage. On the day of her death he suffered a cerebral haemorrhage, and he died the following day on 23 June 1986 at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. The \"New York Times\" obituary adds: \"He had suffered a stroke the previous day, an hour after learning of the death of his wife.\"\n\n\nFinley was also the editor of numerous volumes of essays on ancient history.\n\n\n\n"}

Built between 1908 and 1912, it is an early example of poured-in-place concrete and features 44 rooms, over 200 windows, 18 fireplaces, 10 bathrooms and one powder room. The interior was originally painted in pastel colors, but age and sunlight have all but eradicated any hint of the former hues. One room in the Terrace Pavilion (built on the site of the former home's barn), has a restored paint job so visitors can view the home's former glory. The castle contains built-in furniture and is embellished with decorative tiles, made by Mercer at the height of the Arts and Crafts movement. The castle is filled with an extensive collection of ceramics embedded in the concrete of the house, as well as other artifacts from his world travels, including cuneiform tablets discovered in Mesopotamia dating back to over 2300 BCE. The home also contains around 1,000 prints from Mercer's extensive collection, as well as over six thousand books, almost all of which were annotated by Mercer himself.\n\nThe Castle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was later included in a National Historic Landmark District along with the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works and the Mercer Museum. These three structures are the only poured-in-place concrete structures built by Mercer.

It was based in Iran and trained and financed by Iranian intelligence and Revolutionary Guards.\n\nThe professed aim of the Front was the ‘uprising of all Muslims under Imam Khomeini’. It came to international prominence as the front organisation for the 1981 failed coup in Bahrain, which attempted to install Iraqi Ayatollah Hadi al-Modarresi as the spiritual leader of a theocratic state. Al-Modarresi in addition to heading the IFLB served as Khomeini’s “personal representative” in Bahrain.\nAccording to Daniel Byman of Georgetown University, Iran's backing of the Front was part of a strategy to support radical Islamist groups throughout the region:\n\nThe Front served as an Iranian proxy in the 1980s. It is also referred to as a 'virtual organization' of Iranian intelligence. In Low Intensity Conflict in the Third World by Stephen Blank \"et al.\", it is argued that the Front's attempted coup d’etat in 1981 cannot be understood without reference to Iran’s geo-strategic objectives in its war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq:\nThe 1981 coup was not a success and following the failure to spur revolution, the Front became associated with bomb attacks, often against ‘soft’ civilian targets. On 1 November 1996, the Front claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Diplomat Hotel, with the group telling the Associated Press \"We put a bomb in the Diplomat hotel 20 minutes ago...after the feast...tell the government that we will destroy everyplace.\" In the 1990s uprising in Bahrain the Front only played a marginal role, as its relationship with Iran, the perception that it represented the “Shirazi faction” (i.e. followers of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Shirazi) and its strategy of bombings all served to undermine its support among the wider community.\n\nThe IFLB was disbanded in 2002 and in response to King Hamad's reforms. Its members were amnestied from prison and exile and most returned to Bahrain to work within the political process in 2001, and were active in the Islamic Action Party and the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights.\n\n"}

He was best known as the chief executioner of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, his family, and four retainers on the night of 17 July 1918.\n\nYakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky was the eighth of ten children born to Mikhail Yurovsky, a glazier, and his wife Ester Moiseevna (1848–1919), a seamstress. He was born on in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Russia. The Yurovsky family were Jewish. The historian Helen Rappaport writes that the young Yurovsky studied the Talmud in his early youth, while the family seems to have later attempted to distance themselves from their Jewish roots; this may have been prompted by the prejudice toward Jews frequently exhibited in Russia at the time. Shortly before fully devoting himself to the cause of revolution, in the early twentieth century Yurovsky converted to Lutheranism.\n\nA watchmaker by trade, he lived for a short time in the German Empire in 1904.\n\nAfter returning to Russia during the Russian Revolution of 1905, he joined the Bolsheviks. He received the party ticket no.1500 in Krasnopresnenskaya organization. Arrested several times over the years, he became a devoted Marxist.\n\nHe was a Chekist for a short period of time in 1917.\n\nOn the night of 16/17 July 1918, a squad of Bolshevik secret police (Cheka), led by Yurovsky, executed Russia's last emperor, Nicholas II, along with his wife Alexandra, their four daughters–Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia–and son Alexei. Along with the family, four members of the imperial household (court physician Eugene Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov and footman Alexei Trupp) were also killed. All were shot in a half-cellar room (measured to be 25 feet x 21 feet) of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, a city in the Ural Mountains region, where they were being held prisoner. The firing squad comprised three local Bolsheviks and seven soldiers. It has been documented that the order to assassinate the imperial family came from Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow and had been initiated by Lenin himself. It is also well documented that Yurovsky had visited the Bolshevik leadership in Moscow, and notably Sverdlov, only a few weeks before the killing took place. \n\nTo prevent the development of a personality cult of the former imperial family, the corpses were stripped and dismembered; then taken to the countryside, where they were initially thrown into an abandoned mineshaft. The following morning, when rumours spread in Yekaterinburg regarding the disposal site, Yurovsky removed the bodies. When the vehicle carrying the bodies broke down on the way to the next chosen site, he made new arrangements and threw the bodies into a pit on Koptyaki Road, a since-abandoned cart track 12 miles north of Yekaterinburg, and doused the dismembered remains with sulfuric acid then burned them with gasoline before finally sealing the pit with concrete.\n\nDuring and after the Russian Civil War, Yurovsky worked as a head of local Cheka in Moscow, then member of Vyatka Cheka, head of Yekaterinburg Cheka (1919). In 1921, he worked in the Rabkrin and became Chief of the Gold Department of the Soviet State Treasury. Yurovsky achieved a solid reputation by combating corruption and theft. He also worked in management at the Polytechnical Museum starting in 1928 and became its director in 1930. He died in 1938 of a peptic ulcer.\n\nYurovsky was survived by a wife, two sons, and a daughter.\n\nIn 1920, a British officer who met Yurovsky alleged he was remorseful over his role in the execution of the Romanovs.\n\nThe character of Yakov Yurovsky appeared in several historical films dealing with the execution of the Russian imperial family.\n\nIn the 1971 British epic \"Nicholas and Alexandra\", Yurovsky was depicted much older than 40 (his real age in 1918), as he was played by 65-year-old Alan Webb.\n\nIn the 1991 Russian film \"Tsareubiytsa\", Yurovsky was portrayed by Malcolm McDowell.\n\nIn the 2019 American docudrama \"The Last Czars\", Yurovski was portrayed by Duncan Pow.\n\n"}

He was President of Trinity College, Oxford, from 1978 to 1987.\n\nQuinton was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1975 to 1976. He was chairman of the board of the British Library from 1985 to 1990.\n\nIn 1983, he was made a life peer to the barony \"of Holywell in the City of Oxford and County of Oxfordshire\".\n\nTo BBC Radio audiences, Quinton became well known as a presenter of the long-running \"Round Britain Quiz\".\n\nIn the debate about philosophical universals, Quinton defended a variety of nominalism that identifies properties with a set of \"natural\" classes. David Malet Armstrong has been strongly critical of natural class nominalism: Armstrong believes that Quinton's 'natural' classes avoid a fairly fundamental flaw with more primitive class nominalisms, namely that it has to assume that for every class you can construct, it must then have an associated property. The problem for the class nominalist according to Armstrong is that one must come up with some criteria to determine classes that back properties and those which just contain a collection of heterogeneous objects.\n\nQuinton's version of class nominalism asserts that determining which are the natural property classes is simply a basic fact that is not open to any further philosophical scrutiny. Armstrong argues that whatever it is which picks out the natural classes is not derived from the membership of that class, but from some fact about the particular itself.\n\nWhile Quinton's theory states that no further analysis of the classes is possible, he also says that some classes may be more or less natural—that is, more or less unified than another class. Armstrong illustrates this intuitive difference Quinton is appealing to by pointing to the difference between the class of coloured objects and the class of crimson objects: the crimson object class is more unified in some intuitive sense (how is not specified) than the class of coloured objects.\n\nIn Quinton's 1957 paper, he sees his theory as a less extreme version of nominalism than that of Willard van Orman Quine, Nelson Goodman and Stuart Hampshire.\n\n\n\n"}

He is viewed as a charismatic speaker, enamoring many Muslims, radiating a certain magnetism in his oratory. He spent much of his career in opposition to the Bathist government, and he spent many years in exile, particularly in Bahrain. al-Modarresi returned to Iraq following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and administers humanitarian projects in there. \n\nal-Modarresi was born into a distinguished Shia religious family in Karbala in Iraq. His father is Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad-Kadhim al-Modarresi, the grandson of grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad-Baqir Golpayegani (also known as \"Jorfadiqani\"). His mother is the daughter of grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mahdi al-Shirazi. He claims descent from Zayd ibn Ali (died c. 740 AD), the great-great-grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.\n\nal-Modarresi began his religious education in the religious seminaries of Karbala, at the age of thirteen. He actively sought his religious studies under the auspices of many high ranking scholars, such as Sheikh Hasan al-A'lami, Sheikh Muhammad al-Karbassi, Shaykh Jafar al-Rushti, Shaykh Muhamamd-Husayn al-Mazindarani and his uncles, Sayyids Muhammad, Hassan and Sadiq al-Shirazi. In the late sixties, he and his uncle, Mujtaba al-Shirazi, attended the class of Sayyid Ruhollah Khomeini, and became one of his closest students. He completed the advanced level of his religious education in his early twenties.\n\nal-Modarresi's advocacy of political freedom and strong stance against terrorism started from an early age when Saddam Hussein took power in Iraq. Seventeen members of his wife's family–al-Qazwini–were executed by Saddam's regime or simply disappeared in the notorious Bathist penitentiaries. al-Modarresi wrote the first book to openly attack the regime, published by a religious scholar. Published under a pseudonym in Beirut, the book was titled \"No To Rulers of Iraq\" and sparked a massive political crisis in Baghdad and caused the Bathist regime to issue an ultimatum for the removal of all Lebanese nationals from Iraq within 72 hours.\n\nal-Modarresi eluded execution by moving from house to house, often living in cellars for months and traveling in disguise. When his uncle, Hasan was imprisoned, and the pressures of the Bathists anti-Shia sentiment peaked, al-Modarresi left Iraq in 1970, for Lebanon, and then briefly joined his brother Muhammad-Taqi, in Kuwait.\n\nIn 1973, he emigrated to Bahrain, and exercised his religious activism there. In 1974, he was granted Bahraini citizenship. In Bahrain, al-Modarresi rose to national prominence, and was awarded with power of representation from grand religious authorities such as Muhammad al-Shirazi, Ruhollah Khomeini, Shihab al-Din al-Marashi, and Abd al-A'la al-Sabziwari, being labelled as a scholar \"worthy of taking a leadership position\" and urging Muslims to follow his lead.\n\nIn 1979, the Bahraini authorities placed a travel ban on al-Modarresi, after his organisation, the Islamic Front for Liberation of Bahrain (a branch of his brother's (Muhammad-Taqi) larger risali movement), was announced in the press, being dubbed as an organisation that wanted to import the Iranian revolution into Bahrain, and pointing the finger at al-Modarresi, as its leader. In August of that year, he was kidnapped by the Bahraini intelligence and locked up in a car for up to fourteen hours. However, there was an international uproar, with the interference of some of the Islamic republic's senior leaders, and Yasser Arafat personally, that pressured the Bahraini government to release him, and send him over to Iran, with an apology.\n\nWhilst in Iran, al-Modarresi continued his activism and kept supporting the Bahraini population against the Al Khalifah regime. The IFLB came to prominence as the front organisation for the 1981 coup, which attempted to install al-Modarresi as the spiritual leader of a newly established theocratic Shia state. However the coup failed, and so al-Modarresi reorganised the structure of the Front, focusing on its information efforts in Europe. \n\nal-Modarresi became a founding member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and was among the active figures of the Iraqi opposition in exile. He was closely involved in efforts to expose and bring down the regime in Baghdad. He managed to escape a number of assassination attempts abroad, including one in Brazil in 1991 as well as two more attempts in Syria, by the Bathist intelligence operatives, in 2001.\n\nUpon returning to Iraq after the fall of Saddam's regime, he was greeted by over thirty thousand people in Baghdad, fifty thousand in Sadr City and a similar crowd in his hometown, Karbala.\n\nal-Modarresi established a television station upon his return to his hometown. He is also involved in several large-scale humanitarian projects in Iraq and has been involved in the building of mosques, schools, medical clinics, orphanages, and has been a staunch advocate of women's rights and consistently speaks out against the oppression of women in his lectures and books. He also facilitates marriage by providing financial help to people who wish to get married and has organized several large mass marriage ceremonies. sl-Modarresi also founded and currently heads the League of Religious Scholars which brings together many high ranking Shi’ite scholars or their representatives in Iraq.\n\nal-Modarresi is married to the daughter of prominent scholar, Hashim al-Qazwini (d. 2009), the elder brother of Murtadha al-Qazwini. He has five sons (Mahdi, Muhammad-Ali, Mustafa, Husayn and Muhammad-Kadhim). All of his sons are clerics. \n\nDuring the outbreak of the COVID-19, al-Modarresi expressed the opinion that the virus was a signal of Godly punishment for the Chinese population, because of the foods they consume, that are deemed Islamically unlawful, as well as their mistreatment of the Uighur Muslims. However al-Modarresi did clarify in his speech, that despite the disease affecting a specific nation [at the time of the statement], all nations must cooperate and not take advantage of the disease for political gain, because the disease can still affect us all, hence we must all work collectively to treat this virus, and that this is the responsibility of the entire world.\n\nIn March 2020, al-Modarresi contracted the virus, but has since recovered and reported to be in good health.\n\nal-Modarresi has authored more than 250 books. Some of his books were published under different pen names such as 'Muhammad Hadi' and 'Abdallah al-Hashimi, and 'Muhammad al-Amin Association'. \n\nSome of al-Modarresi's books include:\n\n"}

It was a development of their first design RWD-1. Its feature was a unique, fish-shaped fuselage, with good aerodynamics, but without a direct view forward from the pilot's seat. For this reason, they were later nicknamed: \"blind mice\".\n\nThe first prototype (registration SP-ACE) was completed and flown by the designer Jerzy Drzewiecki in July 1929. \nSince it appeared successful in sports flying, three more RWD-2s were built in 1930 (registration SP-ADJ, -ADG, -ADH).\n\nIn August–September 1929, Franciszek Żwirko and Stanisław Wigura flew the prototype across Europe, on the 5000 km Warsaw-Paris-Barcelona-Warsaw route (it was the first long foreign raid of the Polish-designed aircraft). On 16 October, 1929, Żwirko and Antoni Kocjan set an international FAI altitude record of 4,004 m (13,133 ft) in the light tourist plane class (below 280 kg / 616 lb empty weight).\n\nThree serial aircraft took part in the Challenge 1930 international touring planes competition in July 1930. Stanisław Płonczyński took the 19th place, as the best Pole (for 35 qualified and 60 starting crews), and Edward Więckowski took the 21st place (the third Józef Muślewski was disqualified due to time exceeding, but he completed the rally off the contest). In the Challenge, RWD-2s won the trial of lowest fuel consumption (5.2 kg / 100 km). According to \"Flight\", they \"appear to possess particularly good air-sailing qualities\".\n\nRWD 2s were also used in several Polish air competitions and other minor international ones, with some success. They were also used for training in the Polish Aero Club in Warsaw, Poznań and Vilnius.

{"id": "2158810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158810", "title": "West Shore Railroad", "text": "West Shore Railroad\n\nThe West Shore Railroad was the final name of a railroad that ran from Weehawken, New Jersey, which is across the Hudson River from New York City, north along the west shore of the river to Albany, New York, and then west to Buffalo. It was organized as a competitor to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, but was soon taken over by that company.\n\nThe first part of the line was built as the Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad, incorporated April 16, 1864, and opened in Spring 1866. After only about a year of independent operation, the line served as a branch of the New York Central Railroad (NYC), splitting at Athens Junction near Schenectady and running southeast and south along the west side of the Hudson River to Athens, New York. Early plans included acquiring the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad as a northern extension. The Saratoga and Hudson River was bought and merged into the New York Central as their Athens Branch on September 9, 1867.\n\nThe terminal at Athens was destroyed by fire in 1876. The line ran intermittently from then into the 1880s, with its tracks being torn up for good in 1888. It had been called the \"White Elephant\" Railroad for most of its existence because it quickly outlived whatever usefulness it may have had. Today a row of brick houses known as the Brick Row Historic District which was built in 1850 for the workers of the failed railroad stand in Athens as the only remaining structure related to the \"White Elephant\" Railroad project.\n\nAt the south end of the route, the Ridgefield Park Railroad was incorporated April 4, 1867. This was planned as a branch of the New Jersey Rail Road, splitting at Marion Junction and running north on the west side of the New Jersey Palisades via Ridgefield Park to the state line at Tappan, New York.\n\nAcross the state line, the Rockland Central Railroad was incorporated May 23, 1870, to continue the line to Haverstraw, and the Rockland Central Extension Railroad, incorporated May 29, 1872, was to continue further north along the west side of the Hudson River. The Rockland Central and Rockland Central Extension merged on July 29, 1872, to form a new Rockland Central Railroad, and that company merged with the Ridgefield Park to form the Jersey City and Albany Railroad on June 24, 1873, with the intention of building a full line from Jersey City to Albany.\n\nThe line first opened in 1872 as a spur of the New Jersey Midland Railway, which had built the section south of Ridgefield Park. At that time, the northern terminus was at Tappan; the extension north to Haverstraw, New York, opened in 1879.\n\nBankruptcy struck soon, and the New York section of the line was sold on September 28, 1877, and reorganized October 12, 1878, as the Jersey City and Albany Railway. The part in New Jersey was sold August 17, 1878, and reorganized with the same name, and the two companies merged in January 1879 to form a consolidated Jersey City and Albany Railway.\n\nThe North River Railway was incorporated April 3, 1880, to extend the line north to Albany with a branch to Schenectady and a connection to the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (O&W) at Cornwall, New York. The North River Railway was consolidated with the Jersey City and Albany on May 5, 1881, to form the North River Railroad, again forming a single planned line between Jersey City and Albany.\n\nThe Hudson River West Shore Railroad was incorporated February 16, 1867, and the West Shore Hudson River Railroad was incorporated October 28, 1867, absorbing the Hudson River West Shore on February 16, 1867. This was a second proposed line on the west shore of the river from New Jersey to Albany. The New York, West Shore and Chicago Railroad was incorporated July 13, 1870, and absorbed the West Shore Hudson River on July 21, 1877, with a planned line not only to Albany but then west along the south bank of the Mohawk River to Buffalo. That company was sold and reorganized as the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway on February 18, 1880, and on June 14, 1881, the North River Railroad was merged into it, forming one company in charge of the whole route from New Jersey to Buffalo.\n\nIn 1883, the newly formed company inaugurated service from Newburgh and Jersey City at the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot, where passengers transferred to ferries across the river.\n\nA new alignment was built along the east side of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (formerly the New Jersey Midland) to North Bergen. By 1886, service operated to Weehawken Terminal through a tunnel under Bergen Hill that had been built in the three preceding years.\n\nThe company leased the Athens Branch of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, the old Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad, and incorporated it into their main line between Coxsackie and Fullers. At Ravena, along the Athens Branch, the main line turned northwest towards Schenectady, while a new branch continued north to Kenwood Junction on the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad in Albany. This full line formed an immediate threat to the NYC monopoly.\n\nIn addition to its owned trackage, the West Shore (WS) also had trackage rights over the Suspension Bridge and Erie Junction Railroad and Erie International Railroad, providing a route from Buffalo to Ontario. After the New York Central took over the West Shore, this was useless, as the New York Central had a parallel line, the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad.\n\nThe West Shore also had relations with the Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western Railway (BHT&W), which would have run from the Hoosac Tunnel in Massachusetts west to Buffalo. Instead the BHT&W built only to Rotterdam Junction west of Schenectady; it was later taken over by the Fitchburg Railroad.\n\nIn 1881, the WS had been planned as a link in a new cross-country line from New York to San Francisco, using the Nickel Plate Road, Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, Northern Pacific Railroad and Oregon Navigation Company. However, William Henry Vanderbilt of the NYC had bought the Nickel Plate in 1882, killing that plan. The NYC then proceeded to drive the New York, West Shore and Buffalo into bankruptcy.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) recognized that the WS would make a great addition to their system, allowing them to penetrate deep into NYC territory. At the same time, the NYC was building the South Pennsylvania Railroad across southern Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Railroad's territory. The two railroads came to an agreement, where the NYC would buy the WS and stop building the South Pennsylvania (sections of which were later used for the Pennsylvania Turnpike). The NYC bought the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway on November 24, 1885, and reorganized their new acquisition as the West Shore Railroad on December 5, leasing it for 475 years from January 1, 1886.\n\nIn many sections, the WS ran on a straighter path than the NYC, and was thus used for through freight. For instance, between Oneida and Utica, the WS followed the general line of the never-built Syracuse and Utica Direct Railroad, which had been merged into the NYC.\n\nSeveral named trains traveled north from Weehawken to Albany included the \"Storm King Limited\" and the \"West Shore Limited.\"\n\nMain stops between Albany Union Station and Weehawken Terminal included Ravena, Catskill, Saugerties, Kingston, Highland, Newburgh, Cornwall, West Point, Haverstraw, Congers, West Nyack, Orangeburg, Tappan, all in New York, and Dumont, Teaneck, Bogota, and Ridgefield Park in New Jersey.\nPassenger service on the line ended to Albany in 1958 and to West Haverstraw in 1959, ending direct New York Central train service on the west side of the Hudson River. The line became part of Penn Central in 1968, and passed to Conrail in 1976 after Penn Central's bankruptcy. When Conrail was divided between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern, the West Shore Railroad, along with most of the old New York Central lines, became part of CSX.\n\nIt became CSX's River Subdivision, which begins west of the Hudson Palisades at North Bergen Yard in Hudson County, New Jersey. Proceeding north it passes through Bergen County and Rockland County, New York, and up the west side of the Hudson River to Selkirk Yard, from which there are connections to points west and east. South of North Bergen Yard it connects to the Northern Running Track, part of Conrail. The tunnel under the Palisades is part of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail which emerges at the Hudson Waterfront at Weehawken Port Imperial.\n\nThroughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, New Jersey Transit, the main provider of contemporary rail and bus service in the locale, expressed interest in potentially restoring passenger service to the line due to ever-increasing ridership on the local bus lines.\n\nIn 1997, a $3.97 million grant was given to New Jersey Transit by the Federal Transit Administration. At the time, many towns along the line supported the idea, and went as far as conducting zoning procedures to allow room for the new additions the railroad would bring. Considering the current line is not under proprietorship of New Jersey Transit, a new right-of-way would be installed parallel to the existing freight line.\n\nHowever, funding remained an issue, as did disagreement with CSX. Ultimately, focus on the project was dropped in favor of progress on the Northern Branch Corridor Project and Meadowlands Rail Line (completed in 2009). An official status on the project has not since been noted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158846", "title": "McKinley Monument", "text": "McKinley Monument\n\nThe McKinley Monument is a tall obelisk in Niagara Square, Buffalo, New York. Its location in front of Buffalo City Hall defines the center of Buffalo that all of the main roads converge on.\n\nThe monument was commissioned by the State of New York and dedicated September 6, 1907 to the memory of William McKinley, 25th President of the United States, who was fatally shot while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. Daniel H. Burnham influenced the process of designing the monument by advising that a obelisk should be built in order to call to the importance and significance of the monument. A full restoration had occurred in 2017 as the result of environmental conditions compromising the integrity of the monument.\n\nThe McKinley Monument consists of an obelisk of Vermont and Italian marble with marble lions surrounding the base. It was designed by architects Carrère and Hastings, who had led the design of the Pan-American Exposition, with animal sculptures by Alexander Phimister Proctor that include both sleeping lions (symbols of strength) and turtles (emblems of eternal life).\n\nThe circular plot of land donated by the government of Buffalo, New York was 9 feet (2.7m) in diameter and was entirely filled with the base of the monument. Along with the donation of land, the sum appropriated for the project was approximately $100,000. An addition of $40,000 was expended on repairs of the surrounding neighborhoods. Corporations have spent over $30,000 to conform to the monument site. The commission to oversee the entire project was composed Edward H. Butler, John C. Milburn, General E. A. Curtis, and George E. Matthews. When the monument was fully constructed the base was 7 feet square with the height of 24 feet, while the obelisk extends 69 feet above the base.\n\nIn 1905, a model of the four lions that would surround the base of the McKinley Monument was completed by Alexander Phimister Proctor, who was a very popular American sculptor at the time. Each one of the lions would be sculpted four times larger than an actual lion and made entirely out of white marble. These lions were modeled after Sultan, a veteran lion from the Bronx Zoological Park and weigh approximately 12 tons and are 12 feet long (3.7m).\n\nThe combination of traditional architecture (obelisk) and wild animals was relatively new to American art, but was expressed within this monument.\n\nAt the base of the column, the following inscriptions are found:\"This shaft was erected by the State of New York to honor the memory of William McKinley, twenty-fifth President of the United states of America.\"\n\n\"William McKinley was born at Niles, Ohio, January 29, 1843.\"\n\n\"Was enlisted in Twenty-third Ohio Volunteers June 11,1865, as Major by brevet for gallantry under fire.\"\n\n\"William McKinley was elected to Congress as a Representative of Ohio in 1876, 1878, 1880, 1882, 1884, 1886.\"\n\n\"Was elected Governor of Ohio in 1891 and 1893, and President of the United States in 1896 and 1900.\"\n\n\"William McKinley died in Buffalo September 14, 1901.\"\n\n\"Victim of a treacherous assassin who shot the President as he was extending to him the hand of courtesy.\"\n\n\"The monument was built under the direction of a commission composed of E. H. Butler and George E. Matthews of Buffalo; John G. Milburn of New York, formerly of Buffalo, and at whose home President McKinley died, and E. A. Curtis of Fredonia.\"\n\nArchitect Daniel H. Burnham had a major impact on the obelisk form of the McKinley Monument. He expressed his opinion on the type of monument to be built after being called in by Buffalo government officials. The location in Niagara Square in an already existing park posed some constrains to the monument. The tall buildings around the park along with the unknown expansion would call for a monument that commands attention but would still allow for the use of the park. This lead Burnham to the conclusion of an obelisk monument along with a pedestal base.\n\nAccording to Burnham, a fountain feature would be necessary in the monument but would be difficult to maintain in New York's harsh winters. He determined that the pedestal should have artistic value whether or not water was added to the architecture.\n\nThe McKinley Monument was dedicated on September 6, 1907 to commemorate the assassination of William McKinley during the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 during the Old Home Week Celebration. The day of the dedication a heavy downpour occurred but an estimation of 100,000 observers came to remember a beloved president despite the rain. The ceremony began at 3:00PM with a parade of American and Canadian troops expressing international goodwill. Specifically the troops of two battalions of the Twelfth United States Infantry, the Sixty Fifth Regiment, the National Guard of New York, and Thirteenth Royal Canadian Regiment participated in the dedication.\n\nGovernor Charles Evans Hughes spoke at the dedication of The McKinley Monument. He celebrated the people of democracy who dedicate themselves to public service, encouraging visitors to conserve the ideals that others had set and died for.\n\nPoet Carl Sandburg wrote a poem about the monument called \"Slants at Buffalo, New York\", beginning: \"A forefinger of stone, dreamed by a sculptor, points to the sky. / It says: This way! this way!\"\n\nThe McKinley Monument has been significantly effected by exposure to the elements for over a century, so a complete restoration occurred June 2017 to September 2017. The Flynn Battaglia Company was selected to restore the monument. They started by removing damaged marble blocks and replacing them with new blocks from the same quarry in Vermont. The paving stones and stairs were removed and reset in ground, stone poles were cleaned while two were replaced, and the fountains were relined to prevent leaking.\n\n"}

It has been open since antiquity and contains a large amount of graffiti.\n\nThere are two known plans of the tomb's layout contemporary to its construction. One on papyrus (now located at the Egyptian Museum in Turin) provides a detailed depiction of the tomb at 1:28 scale. All of the passages and chambers are present, with measurements written in hieratic script. The papyrus plan also depicts the pharaoh's sarcophagus surrounded by four concentric sets of shrines, the same layout of shrines that were found intact within Tutankhamun's tomb. The other plan of the tomb was found inscribed on a slab of limestone not far from the tomb's entrance, and is a rough layout of the tomb depicting the location of its doors. The latter plan may have just been a \"workman's doodle\" but the papyrus plan almost certainly had a deeper ritual meaning, and may have been used to consecrate the tomb after it was built.\n\nA hieratic ostracon has been discovered mentioning the initiation of the tomb, its location selected by the local governor and two of the pharaoh's chief attendants in the second year of his reign. Ramesses IV ascended the throne late in life, and to ensure that he would have a sizable tomb (during what would be a relatively brief reign of about six years), he doubled the size of the existing work gangs at Deir el-Medina to a total of 120 men. Though sizable, KV2 has been described as being \"simplistic\" in its design and decoration. The tomb was excavated at the base of a hill on the northwest side of the Valley of the Kings.\n\nLike other tombs of the 20th Dynasty, KV2 is laid out along a straight axis. The successors of Ramesses III from this dynasty constructed tombs that follow this pattern and most were decorated in a similar manner to one other.\n\nThe tomb has a maximum length of 88.66 m and consists of three slowly descending corridors labeled B, C, and D. This is followed by an enlarged chamber (E), and then the burial chamber (J). Past the burial chamber lies a narrow corridor (K) flanked by three side chambers [Ka, Kb and Kc].\n\nThe tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from the \"Litany of Ra\", \"Book of Caverns\", \"Book of the Dead\", \"Book of Amduat\" and the \"Book of the Heavens\".\n\nThe sarcophagus is broken (probably in antiquity), and the mummy was relocated to the mummy cache in KV35.\n\nThe tomb was one of about eleven tombs open to early travelers. KV2 contains the second-highest number of ancient graffiti within it (after KV9), with 656 individual graffitos left by both Ancient Greek and Roman visitors. This tomb also contains around 50 or so examples of Coptic graffiti, mostly sketched onto the right wall by the entranceway, The tomb was likely used as a dwelling by Coptic monks, and there are also depictions of Coptic saints and crosses on the tomb's walls.\n\nEarly European visitors to the area included Richard Pococke, who visited KV2 and designated it \"Tomb B\" in his \"Observations of Egypt\", published in 1743.\n\nThe savants accompanying Napoleon's campaign in Egypt surveyed the Valley of the Kings and designated KV2 as \"IIe Tombeau\" (\"2nd Tomb\") in their list. Other visitors of note included James Burton, who mapped out the tomb in 1825, and the Franco-Tuscan Expedition of 1828-1829, who did an epigraphic survey of the tomb's inscriptions.\n\nArcheologist Edward Ayrton excavated the entranceway to the tomb during 1905/1906, followed by Howard Carter in 1920. Both of them found remnants of the materials which had originally come from inside the tomb, such as shabtis, numerous ostraca and fragments of wood, glass and Faience.\n\n\n"}

Roosevelt, 32nd president of the United States.\n\nRoosevelt was born on July 16, 1828 in Hyde Park, New York to businessman Isaac Daniel Roosevelt and Mary Rebecca Aspinwall, sister of William Henry Aspinwall. Isaac's parents were businessman and politician Jacobus Roosevelt III and Catherine Welles. James' maternal grandparents were John Aspinwall and Susan Howland.\n\nIn 1847, James Roosevelt graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York.\n\nAfter obtaining a law degree from Harvard University, Roosevelt joined the law firm of Benjamin D. Silliman, the latter arranging Roosevelt serve on the founding board of directors to the company's client, the Consolidated Coal Company of Maryland. Doug Wead wrote that Roosevelt applied the skills he learned from watching the growth of this company to his own enterprise.\n\nRoosevelt's business interests were primarily in coal and transportation. He was vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Railway and president of the Southern Railway Security Company.\n\nDuring an 1853 trip to London shortly after his marriage, Roosevelt called upon United States Minister to the United Kingdom James Buchanan and accepted an invitation by Buchanan to serve as the minister's secretary at the embassy. Conrad Black wrote that this began the tradition of members of the Hyde Park Roosevelt family being affiliated with Democratic presidents.\n\nFollowing the 1863 death of his father, Roosevelt inherited both his wealth and status as patriarch of the family. Roosevelt purchased an estate that he bestowed the name \"Springwood\". In 1871, Roosevelt was elected town supervisor of Hyde Park and was pursued as a potential candidate for the New York state assembly or senate or Congress, requests that he turned down despite having an interest in politics.\n\nIn the 1880s, Roosevelt donated to the New York gubernatorial campaign of Grover Cleveland and Cleveland's presidential campaign two years later. After the 1884 United States presidential election, in which Cleveland was elected president, the Roosevelt family regularly met with the Clevelands in visits to the White House. Roosevelt was seen by the press as a possible appointee for a diplomatic appointee within the Cleveland administration, though he turned down these rumors. Roosevelt did contribute to his eldest son James being appointed to the post of First Secretary of the United States Legation in Vienna.\n\nFollowing graduation from Union College in 1847, Roosevelt traveled through Western Europe and the Holy Land before matriculating at Harvard Law School in 1849. In 1853, he married his second cousin, Rebecca Brien Howland, the sister of Meredith Howland. They had one son the next year, James Roosevelt \"Rosey\" Roosevelt, who married Helen Schermerhorn Astor. 1875 saw Rebecca's health falter as she demonstrated symptoms of heart disease and she was advised by doctors to stop climbing stairs, leading James to install elevators for her to use in both Springwood and their New York home. In August 1876, the couple traveled on James' yacht for a cruise to Long Island Sound, during which Rebecca experienced a massive heart attack when the pair were underway and died a short time afterward.\n\nFour years after Rebecca's death, he met a sixth cousin named Sara Ann Delano, daughter of merchant Warren Delano Jr., at a party celebrating the graduation of his distant cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. from Harvard University. James and Sara were married on October 7, 1880, and became the parents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1882, who married Eleanor Roosevelt. James reportedly was a caring father to Franklin, but his recurring heart problems eventually made him an invalid. Franklin reacted by becoming fiercely protective of his father.\n\nBy the autumn of 1900, Roosevelt's health declined further after his yacht exploded and sank and the exploits of his grandson Tadd that included dropping out of Harvard prior to a disappearance that was proceeded by mocking from the press that also served to disillusion James. James died twenty years after he married Sara and left the bulk of his estate to her, and a modest inheritance to Franklin. He is buried at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park; his grave is flanked by those of his wives.\n\nRoosevelt is voiced by John Lithgow in \"The Roosevelts\", a 2014 documentary series by Ken Burns.\n\nIn 1927 Franklin and Sara Roosevelt donated money to the town of Hyde Park for the construction of a new library, named after James, and still in use today.\n"}
{"id": "2158876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158876", "title": "Port of Hamburg", "text": "Port of Hamburg\n\nThe Port of Hamburg (German: \"Hamburger Hafen\") is a sea port on the river Elbe in Hamburg, Germany, from its mouth on the North Sea.\n\nIt's Germany's largest port and is named the country's \"Gateway to the World\" (Tor zur Welt). In terms of TEU throughput, Hamburg is the third-busiest port in Europe (after Rotterdam and Antwerp) and 15th-largest worldwide. In 2014, 9.73 million TEUs (20-foot standard container equivalents) were handled in Hamburg.\n\nThe port covers an area of (64.80 km² usable), of which 43.31 km² (34.12 km²) are land areas. The location is naturally advantaged by a branching Elbe, creating an ideal place for a port complex with warehousing and transshipment facilities. The extensive free port was established when Hamburg joined the German Customs Union. It enabled duty-free storing of imported goods and also importing of materials which were processed, re-packaged, used in manufacturing and then re-exported without incurring customs duties. The free port was abandoned in 2013.\n\nThe port is almost as old as the history of Hamburg itself. Founded on 7 May 1189 by Frederick I for its strategic location, it has been Central Europe's main port for centuries and enabled Hamburg to develop early into a leading city of trade with a rich and proud bourgeoisie.\n\nDuring the age of the Hanseatic League from the 13th to 16th century, Hamburg was considered second only to the port and city of Lübeck in terms of its position as a central trading node for sea-borne trade. With discovery of the Americas and the emerging transatlantic trade, Hamburg exceeded all other German ports. During the second half of the 19th century, Hamburg became Central Europe's main hub for transatlantic passenger and freight travel, and from 1871 onward it was Germany's principal port of trade. In her time the Hamburg America Line was the largest shipping company in the world. Since 1888, the HADAG runs a scheduled ferry service across various parts of the port and the Elbe. The Free Port, established on 15 October 1888, enabled traders to ship and store goods without going through customs and further enhanced Hamburg's position in sea trade with neighbouring countries. The Moldauhafen has a similar arrangement, though related to the Czech Republic exclusively.\n\nThe \"Speicherstadt\", one of Hamburg's architectural icons today, is a large wharf area of 350,000 m² floor area on the northern shore of the river, built in the 1880s as part of the free port and to cope with the growing quantity of goods stored in the port.\n\nHamburg shipyards lost fleets twice after World War I and World War II, and during the partition of Germany between 1945 and 1990, the Port of Hamburg lost much of its hinterland and consequently many of its trading connections. However, since German reunification, the fall of the Iron Curtain and European enlargement, Hamburg has made substantial ground as one of Europe's prime logistics centres and as one of the world's largest and busiest sea ports.\n\nDeepening of the river Elbe for large vessels is controversial for ecological reasons. In part due to cooperation with Lower Saxony and Bremen to build a new container port (JadeWeserPort) in the deep waters of Jadebusen in Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg withdrew from this plan after a change of government in 2001.\n\nHamburg is a major cruise destination and one of Europe's largest ports of call for cruise passengers traveling the Atlantic, or the Norwegian and Baltic Seas. The port is also a major location for shipbuilder and shipyards, designing, building and reconditioning yachts and cruise liners. Hamburg has three passenger terminals for cruise ships: Hamburg Cruise Center HafenCity, the Hamburg Cruise Center Altona and the Hamburg Cruise Center , all three capable of processing the world's largest cruise ships.\n\nThe Port of Hamburg is also one of Hamburg's largest attractions, both as a living, industrial and logistic center but also as a backdrop for modern culture and the port's history. Among these are various museum ships, musical theaters, bars, restaurants and hotels - and even a floating boat church.\n\nThe annual celebration of the port's birthday (\"Hafengeburtstag\") during the first weekend of May is one of Hamburg's biggest public events. National and international visitors come to experience the festivities. Tugboats perform \"ballets\", old galleons and new cruise ships are open for tours, and fireworks explode at night.\n\nTour guides on boat tours in the port are called he lüchts (Low German for \"he is lying\") after an often used call of dock workers when they overheard the stories told to tourists.\n\n\n"}

It was released in September 1977 as the album's lead single. It became both Joel's first US Top 10 and UK Top 20 single (reaching #3 and #19 respectively), as well as Joel's first gold single in the US. The song also topped the \"Billboard\" Easy Listening Chart for the entire month of January 1978.\n\n\"Just the Way You Are\" garnered two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year in 1979.\n\nJoel shared that the melody and chord progression for this song came to him while he was dreaming. In an interview on the Howard Stern Radio Show on November 16, 2010, Joel revealed that the inspiration for writing the name of the song and how it sounds in the chorus was directly taken from the last line in the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song \"Rag Doll\"; which incidentally was also a larger inspiration for Joel's later song, \"Uptown Girl\". The song, which Joel had written for his first wife (and also his business manager at the time) Elizabeth Weber, was not liked by either Joel or his band, and Joel had originally decided against making the track a part of \"The Stranger\", but at the request of both Linda Ronstadt and Phoebe Snow (both were recording in other studios in the same building at the time), he agreed to put the song on the final mix. However, the album's producer, Phil Ramone, later contradicted Joel's claim, stating in an interview that they could not afford to exclude the song because Joel did not have that much material from which to choose for the album. The song also shares some similarities to \"I'm Not in Love\" by 10cc, due to the keyboard and background vocal tape loops Joel and Ramone used.\n\nAfter Joel and Weber split in 1982, Joel rarely performed the song live after 1986 until the 2000s, and Joel has publicly stated that he disliked playing the song live in the wake of his divorce from his first wife. He noted that during performances of the song around the time of his first divorce, his drummer Liberty DeVitto would jokingly parody the lyrics in the chorus as \"She got the house. She got the car.\"\n\nWhen \"Just the Way You Are\" was released as a single, it was shortened by over a minute. The differences are the removal of the second verse and an earlier fade. A live performance of the song was also used as a music video. On February 18, 1978, the song peaked at #3, and Joel performed a shorter version of the song as the musical guest that day on \"Saturday Night Live\" (along with \"Only the Good Die Young\"). The single version (fading 8 seconds later) was included in the first release of \"Greatest Hits Volume I & Volume II\", but the full album version was restored for the remastered release of that compilation. \"Just the Way You Are\" is one of Joel's jazz track besides \"James\" in his 1976 album Turnstiles.\n\nThe saxophone solo was played by Phil Woods, a well-known jazz performer and Grammy award winner. Woods was criticized by some purists in the jazz community for playing on a rock session, but in fact he had already played previously on such sessions both for Steely Dan and for Paul Simon. The performance here on a hit record undoubtedly exposed him to a wider audience and introduced his music to rock fans.\n\n\n\n\n7\" U.S. and UK single (1977)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2158884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158884", "title": "Mary Boykin Chesnut", "text": "Mary Boykin Chesnut\n\nMary Boykin Chesnut (née Miller) (March 31, 1823 – November 22, 1886) was an American author noted for a book published as her Civil War diary, a \"vivid picture of a society in the throes of its life-and-death struggle.\" She described the war from within her upper-class circles of Southern planter society, but encompassed all classes in her book. She was married to a lawyer who served as a United States senator and Confederate officer.\nChesnut worked toward a final form of her book in 1881–1884, based on her extensive diary written during the war years. It was published in 1905, 19 years after her death. New versions were published after her papers were discovered, in 1949 by the novelist Ben Ames Williams, and in 1981 by the historian C. Vann Woodward. His annotated edition of the diary, \"Mary Chesnut's Civil War\" (1981), won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982. Literary critics have praised Chesnut's diary—the influential writer Edmund Wilson termed it \"a work of art\" and a \"masterpiece\" of the genre—and the most important work by a Confederate author.\n\nMary Chesnut was born on March 31, 1823, on her maternal grandparents' plantation, called Mount Pleasant, near Stateburg, South Carolina, in the High Hills of Santee. Her parents were Stephen Decatur Miller (1788–1838), who had served as a U.S. Representative, and Mary Boykin (1804–85). In 1829 her father was elected governor of South Carolina and in 1831 as a U.S. Senator. The family then lived in Charleston. Mary was the oldest of four children; she had a younger brother Stephen and two sisters: Catherine and Sarah Amelia.\n\nAt age 13, Miller began her formal education in Charleston, where she boarded at Madame Talvande's French School for Young Ladies, which attracted daughters from the élite of the planter class. Talvande was among the many French colonial refugees who had settled in Charleston from Saint-Domingue (Haiti) after its Revolution. Miller became fluent in French and German, and received a strong education.\n\nLeaving politics, her father took his family to Mississippi where he bought extensive acreage. It was a crude, rough frontier compared to Charleston. He owned three cotton plantations and hundreds of slaves. Mary lived in Mississippi for short periods between school terms but was much more fond of the city.\n\nIn 1836, while in Charleston, thirteen-year-old Mary Boykin Miller met her future husband, James Chesnut, Jr. (1815–85), who was eight years her senior. At age seventeen, Miller married Chesnut on April 23, 1840. They first lived with his parents and sisters at Mulberry, their plantation near Camden, South Carolina. His father, James Chesnut, Sr. (whom Mary referred to throughout her diaries as the “Old Colonel”), had gradually purchased and reunited the land holdings of his father John. He was said to own about five square miles at the maximum and to hold about 500 slaves by 1849.\n\nIn 1858, by then an established lawyer and politician, James Chesnut, Jr. was elected a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and served as such until South Carolina's secession from the Union in December 1860, shortly following the election of Abraham Lincoln. Once the Civil War broke out, Chesnut became an aide to President Jefferson Davis and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. The couple resided at Chesnut Cottage in Columbia during the Civil War period.\n\nIntelligent and witty, Mary Chesnut took part in her husband's career, as entertaining was an important part of building political networks. She had her best times when they were in the capitals of Washington, DC, and Richmond. She suffered from depression, in part because of her inability to have children, and would occasionally self-medicate with opium. The Chesnuts' marriage was at times stormy owing to their differences in temperament (she was more hot-tempered and sometimes considered her husband reserved), but their companionship was mostly warm and affectionate.\n\nAs Mary Chesnut describes in her diary, the Chesnuts had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the upper society of the South and government of the Confederacy. Among them were, for example, Confederate general John Bell Hood, politician John L. Manning, general and politician John S. Preston and his wife Caroline, general and politician Wade Hampton III, politician Clement C. Clay and his wife Virginia, and general and politician Louis T. Wigfall and his wife Charlotte (also known as Louise). The Chesnuts were also family friends of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his wife Varina Howell.\n\nAlso among these circles were Sara Agnes Rice Pryor and her husband Roger, a Congressman. Sara Pryor, Virginia Clay-Clopton and Louise Wigfall Wright wrote memoirs of the war years which were published in the early twentieth century; their three works were particularly recommended by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to their large membership.\n\nLike many of the planter elite, the Chesnuts fell on hard times after the war. They lost 1,000 slaves as property through emancipation. James Chesnut, Sr. died in 1866; his will left his son the use of Mulberry Plantation and Sandy Hill, both of which were encumbered by debt, and eighty-three slaves by name, who were by then freedmen. The younger Chesnut struggled to build up the plantations and support his father's dependents.\n\nBy his father's will, James Chesnut, Jr. had the use of Mulberry and Sandy Hill plantations only during his lifetime. In February 1885, both he and Mary's mother died. The plantations passed on to a male Chesnut descendant, and Mary Boykin Chesnut received almost no income for her support. She also found her husband had many debts related to the estate which he had been unable to clear. She struggled in her last year, dying in 1886 at her home, Sarsfield, in Camden, South Carolina. She was buried next to her husband in Knights Hill Cemetery in Camden, South Carolina.\n\nMary Boykin Chesnut began her diary on February 18, 1861, and ended it on June 26, 1865. She would write at the outset: “This journal is intended to be entirely objective. My subjective days are over.” Chesnut was an eyewitness to many historic events as she accompanied her husband to significant sites of the Civil War. Among them were Montgomery, Alabama and Richmond, Virginia, where the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of America convened; Charleston, where she was among witnesses of the first shots of the Civil War; Columbia, South Carolina, where her husband served as the Chief of the Department of the Military of South Carolina and brigadier general in command of South Carolina reserve forces; and again Richmond, where her husband served as an aide to the president. At times they also lived with her parents-in-law at their house at Mulberry Plantation near Camden. While the property was relatively isolated in thousands of acres of plantation and woodland, they entertained many visitors.\n\nChesnut was aware of the historical importance of what she witnessed. The diary was filled with the cycle of changing fortunes of the South during the Civil War. Chesnut edited it and wrote new drafts in 1881–1884 for publication, and retained the sense of events unfolding without foreknowledge. She had the sense of the South's living through its time on a world stage, and she captured the growing difficulties of all classes of the Confederacy as the society faced defeat at the end of the war. Politically aware, Chesnut analyzed and portrayed the various classes of the South through the years of the war, providing a detailed view of southern society and especially of the mixed roles of men and women. She was forthright about the complex and fraught situations related to slavery, particularly the abuses of women's sexuality and the power exercised by white men. For instance, Chesnut discussed the problem of white planters' fathering mixed-race children with enslaved women within their extended households.\n\nExamination of Mary Chesnut's papers has revealed the history of her development as a writer and of her work on the diary as a book. Before working to revise her diary as a book in the 1880s, Chesnut wrote a translation of French poetry, essays, and a family history. She also wrote three full novels that she never published: \"The Captain and the Colonel,\" completed about 1875; and \"Two Years of My Life,\" finished about the same time. She finished most of a draft of a third long novel, called \"Manassas.\" Elisabeth Muhlenfeld, who edited the first two novels for publication by the University of Virginia Press in 2002 and wrote a biography of Chesnut, described them as her writing \"apprenticeship.\"\n\nChesnut used her diary and notes to work toward a final version in 1881–1884. Based on her drafts, historians do not believe she was finished with her work. Because Chesnut had no children, before her death she gave her diary to her closest friend Isabella D. Martin and urged her to have it published. The diary was first published in 1905 as a heavily edited and abridged edition. Williams' 1949 version was described as more readable, but sacrificing historical reliability and many of Chesnut's literary references. The 1981 version by C. Vann Woodward retained more of her original work, provides an overview of her life and society in the introduction, and was annotated to identify fully the large cast of characters, places and events.\n\n\nChesnut's reputation rests on the fact that she created literature while keeping the sense of events unfolding; she described people in penetrating and enlivening terms and conveyed a novelistic sense of events through a \"mixture of reportage, memoir and social criticism\". Critic and writer Edmund Wilson summarized her achievement:\n\nThe very rhythm of her opening pages at once puts us under the spell of a writer who is not merely jotting down her days but establishing, as a novelist does, an atmosphere, an emotional tone...Starting out with situations or relationships of which she cannot know the outcome, she takes advantage of the actual turn of events to develop them and round them out as if she were molding a novel.\n\nChesnut has had some detractors, notably history professor Kenneth S. Lynn, of Johns Hopkins University. He described her work as a \"hoax\" and a \"fabrication\" in a 1981 \"New York Times\" review of Woodward's edition of the diaries. Lynn argues that the diary was \"composed\" (rather than simply rewritten) in the 1881-84 period, emphasizing that Chesnut both omitted a great deal from the original diaries and added much new material: \"She dwelt upon the personalities of people to whom she had previously referred only briefly, plucked a host of bygone conversations from her memory and interjected numerous authorial reflections on historical and personal events.\"\n\nBut, since neither Chesnut nor her later editors conceded that she had heavily revised her work, Lynn's view that the whole project is a fraud is a minority one. In 1982, Woodward's edition of Chesnut's diary won a Pulitzer Prize. A few years later, Ken Burns used extensive readings from Chesnut's diary in his documentary television series, \"The Civil War\". Academy Award-nominated actress Julie Harris read these sections.\n\nIn 2000, Mulberry Plantation, the house of James and Mary Boykin Chesnut in Camden, South Carolina, was designated a National Historic Landmark, due to its importance to America's national heritage and literature. The plantation and its buildings are representative of James and Mary Chesnut's elite planter class.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2158886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158886", "title": "Single-event upset", "text": "Single-event upset\n\nA single-event upset (SEU) is a change of state caused by one single ionizing particle (ions, electrons, photons...) striking a sensitive node in a micro-electronic device, such as in a microprocessor, semiconductor memory, or power transistors. The state change is a result of the free charge created by ionization in or close to an important node of a logic element (e.g. memory \"bit\"). The error in device output or operation caused as a result of the strike is called an SEU or a soft error.\n\nThe SEU itself is not considered permanently damaging to the transistor's or circuits' functionality unlike the case of single-event latch-up (SEL), single-event gate rupture (SEGR), or single-event burnout (SEB). These are all examples of a general class of radiation effects in electronic devices called \"single-event effects\" (SEEs).\n\nSingle-event upsets were first described during above-ground nuclear testing, from 1954 to 1957, when many anomalies were observed in electronic monitoring equipment. Further problems were observed in space electronics during the 1960s, although it was difficult to separate soft failures from other forms of interference. In 1972, a Hughes satellite experienced an upset where the communication with the satellite was lost for 96 seconds and then recaptured. Scientists Dr. Edward C. Smith, Al Holman, and Dr. Dan Binder explained the anomaly as a single-event upset (SEU) and published the first SEU paper in the IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science journal in 1975. In 1978, the first evidence of soft errors from alpha particles in packaging materials was described by Timothy C. May and M.H. Woods. In 1979, James Ziegler of IBM, along with W. Lanford of Yale, first described the mechanism whereby a sea-level cosmic ray could cause a single event upset in electronics.\n\nTerrestrial SEU arise due to cosmic particles colliding with atoms in the atmosphere, creating cascades or showers of neutrons and protons, which in turn may interact with electronic circuits. At deep sub-micron geometries, this affects semiconductor devices in the atmosphere.\n\nIn space, high-energy ionizing particles exist as part of the natural background, referred to as galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Solar particle events and high-energy protons trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere (Van Allen radiation belts) exacerbate this problem. The high energies associated with the phenomenon in the space particle environment generally render increased spacecraft shielding useless in terms of eliminating SEU and catastrophic single-event phenomena (e.g. destructive latch-up). Secondary atmospheric neutrons generated by cosmic rays can also have sufficiently high energy for producing SEUs in electronics on aircraft flights over the poles or at high altitude. Trace amounts of radioactive elements in chip packages also lead to SEUs.\n\nThe sensitivity of a device to SEU can be empirically estimated by placing a test device in a particle stream at a cyclotron or other particle accelerator facility. This particular test methodology is especially useful for predicting the SER (soft error rate) in known space environments, but can be problematic for estimating terrestrial SER from neutrons. In this case, a large number of parts must be evaluated, possibly at different altitudes, to find the actual rate of upset.\n\nAnother way to empirically estimate SEU tolerance is to use a chamber shielded for radiation, with a known radiation source, such as Caesium-137.\n\nWhen testing microprocessors for SEU, the software used to exercise the device must also be evaluated to determine which sections of the device were activated when SEUs occurred.\n\nBy definition, SEUs do not destroy the circuits involved, but they can cause errors. In space-based microprocessors, one of the most vulnerable portions is often the 1st and 2nd-level cache memories, because these must be very small and have very high-speed, which means that they do not hold much charge. Often these caches are disabled if terrestrial designs are being configured to survive SEUs. Another point of vulnerability is the state machine in the microprocessor control, because of the risk of entering \"dead\" states (with no exits), however, these circuits must drive the entire processor, so they have relatively large transistors to provide relatively large electric currents and are not as vulnerable as one might think. Another vulnerable processor component is the RAM. To ensure resilience to SEUs, often an error correcting memory is used, together with circuitry to periodically read (leading to correction) or scrub (if reading does not lead to correction) the memory of errors, before the errors overwhelm the error-correcting circuitry.\n\nIn digital and analog circuits, a single event may cause one or more voltages pulses (i.e. glitches) to propagate through the circuit, in which case it is referred to as a single-event transient (SET). Since the propagating pulse is not technically a change of \"state\" as in a memory SEU, one should differentiate between SET and SEU. If a SET propagates through digital circuitry and results in an incorrect value being latched in a sequential logic unit, it is then considered an SEU.\n\nHardware problems can also occur for related reasons. Under certain circumstances (of both circuit design, process design, and particle properties) a \"parasitic\" thyristor inherent to CMOS designs can be activated, effectively causing an apparent short-circuit from power to ground. This condition is referred to as \"latch-up\", and in absence of constructional countermeasures, often destroys the device due to thermal runaway. Most manufacturers design to prevent latch-up, and test their products to ensure that latch-up does not occur from atmospheric particle strikes. In order to prevent latch-up in space, epitaxial substrates, silicon on insulator (SOI) or silicon on sapphire (SOS) are often used to further reduce or eliminate the susceptibility.\n\nIn the 2003 elections in Brussels's municipality Schaerbeek (Belgium), an anomalous recorded number of votes triggered an investigation that concluded a SEU was responsible for giving a candidate 4,096 extra votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the mother of First Lady of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt. Anna was described as a celebrated beauty.\n\nAnna Rebecca Hall was born on March 17, 1863. She was the eldest of seven children born to Valentine Gill Hall Jr. and Mary Livingston Ludlow of the Livingston family. Their marriage \"...united a member of a prominent New York merchantile family with Hudson River gentry\". Anna was born in New York City and was a granddaughter of Edward Hunter Ludlow.\n\nHer brothers, Valentine III and Edward, were both tennis champions and, later, alcoholics who spent beyond their means and inheritances. Anna's four sisters were Elizabeth, Mary, Edith, and Maude. Her father died without leaving a will when Anna was 17, and she was forced to take control of the family and help manage the finances.\n\nAnna was one of the leading debutantes of the 1881 season. A prominent figure among the New York City social elite, she was a skilled horsewoman. It is believed that Anna and Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt, the brother of future President Theodore Roosevelt, became engaged Memorial Day, 1883, at a house party given by their friend, Laura Delano, at Algonac, the Delano estate on the Hudson River at Newburgh, New York. At the time, Anna was living at Oak Terrace, her family's estate far upriver at Tivoli, New York.\n\nOn December 1, 1883, she married Roosevelt in Calvary Church at Gramercy Park in New York City. The couple moved into a brownstone house in the fashionable Thirties. Anna bore Elliott three children:\n\n\nAnna Roosevelt was responsible for numerous social events and charity balls. Her brother-in-law Theodore considered her frivolous. At the time of their marriage on December 1, 1883, Elliott was already known as a heavy drinker addicted to laudanum. Often subject to headaches and depressions, Anna was somewhat ashamed of her daughter Eleanor's plainness and nicknamed Eleanor \"Granny\", due to the child's serious demeanor.\n\nIn the spring of 1887, the family sailed to Europe aboard the \"S.S. Britannic\". One day out of port, their ship was rammed by the \"S.S. Celtic\", the bow of which pierced a full ten feet into the side of the \"S.S. Britannic\", killing several passengers and injuring numerous others. The Roosevelt party was evacuated to lifeboats before continuing their voyage aboard another ocean liner. Upon their return, Elliott commenced construction of his Long Island country residence, \"Half Way Nirvana\". Parties at their estate included polo and riding-to-the-hounds.\n\nIn 1889, after the birth of their second child, Elliott's drinking only increased, and the family traveled to Austria in search of treatment. After three months, they moved to Paris, where Anna's third child, a son, (Gracie) Hall, was born. The marriage teetered on collapse during their time in France. Soon afterward, Elliott and Anna separated.\n\nWhen Eleanor was eight, Anna contracted diphtheria and died at age 29 at her home, 52 East 61st Street in Manhattan. Elliott died at his home, 313 West 102 Street on August 14, 1894, from a seizure after a suicide attempt and the cumulative effects of alcoholism. The remains of both Anna and Elliott are interred in the Hall family vault at the cemetery of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Tivoli.\n\nAnna's daughter Eleanor would go on to become First Lady of the United States when her husband, Elliott's fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt, became President of the United States in March 1933.\n\n"}

The school part of the Glendale Unified School District.\n\nGlendale High School was founded as Glendale Union High School in 1901 by the residents of the villages of Glendale, La Crescenta, Burbank, Eagle Rock, Ivanhoe, Tropico and West Glendale.\n\nThe first classes were held at the Glendale Hotel. The first principal was Mr. Llewellyn Evans and the school had of two teachers and 29 students. The next year, a new school building was built at the corner of what is today Brand Boulevard and Broadway.\n\nGeorge Moyse was appointed principal and continued in his role for 35 years until 1937. The school continued to grow rapidly and the school moved several times, in 1907 to Harvard Street and in 1914 to Maryland Street.\n\nThe school continued to grow, as enrollment reached 800 in 1920 and 1,050 in 1921. It was decided then to move the Grade 10, 11 and 12 classes to a new campus at the corner of the present-day Broadway and Verdugo Road (Grade 9 students remained at the Maryland Street campus, and were later integrated into area Middle Schools). The school has remained in this location (1440 East Broadway, at the southeast corner of Verdugo) since 1924.\n\nThe Class of 1960 was Glendale's largest, with 903 graduates. Crescenta Valley High School opened in September 1960, taking a sizable portion of Glendale's students.\n\nThe school suffered extensive damage during spring break on March 22, 1964, when a student who was concerned about his grades set fire to the room in which he thought the grade information was stored. The fire quickly spread throughout the administration building and to adjacent buildings on the campus. The decision was made to reconstruct the campus, leaving the swimming pool, baseball field, tennis courts and football stadium as the only remnants of the old campus.\n\nIn 1966, Captain Max Schumacher, an aerial traffic reporter for local radio station KMPC, landed his helicopter on the football field during a school assembly and spoke about traffic safety. He was later killed in a crash with a police helicopter near Dodger Stadium.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the decision was made by the School Board to reintegrate ninth graders into the Glendale Unified School District high schools (with the exception of Crescenta Valley High School, which had already transitioned to a four-year high school in September 1983). As a result, the 'J' building was constructed in 1994–1995, opening in September 1995.\n\nIn 2001, Glendale High School celebrated its centenary. The student population was then 3,500 and there were over 100 teachers.\n\nIn 2001, the Glendale High School Visual and Performing Arts Program (VAPA) was awarded the BRAVO Award for excellence in arts education by the Los Angeles County Music Center. In 2003, the program won another award, the Creative Ticket National School of Distinction Award from the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.. Glendale High School was the only public high school to be awarded this honor.\n\nOn July 1, 2005, Katherine Fundukian replaced LeRoy Sherman and Lou Stewart as co-principals, as part of a School District decision to move Glendale High School back to a \"traditional\" one-principal system from the two-principal system that had been in place.\n\nIn 2006, eight students from Glendale High School represented the United States at the Junior G8 summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where they discussed world issues and met with the leaders of the G8 nations.\n\nGlendale High's mathematics department received the highest average AP scores in the United States in 2012.\n\nSince 1999, the dance/drill team program has won over 50 National Championship titles. The Glendale High School Junior Varsity and Varsity dance/drill team competes annually at the United Spirit Association Nationals competition and starting in the 2018 Season now competes annually at the West Coast Elite Dance Nationals competition.

Hayhurst, with University of Southern California student Vic Francy serving as one of the assistants. During that year, the first team to score against them did so in one of the postseason semifinal games.\n\n\n\n\nEvery March, the school holds its annual \"Oratorical\" event. Students from each class (Grades 9, 10, 11, and 12) are judged on:\n\nThe tradition was started in 1910, at a time of heightened interest in public speaking in Southern California. It has continued through the years, demonstrating to the community the pride that students have in the school. The event is judged by a combination of alumni, community members and members of the military. As of 2014, only four classes have ever won all four categories, the classes of 1999, 2010, 2012, and 2014.\n\nThe school newspaper, the \"Explosion\", was first published in 1917 and has continued to be published semi-quarterly.\n\nThe school yearbook, the \"Stylus\", was started in 1909 as a monthly publication. In 1910, it became a quarterly publication, being published each quarter by a different grade level. Later, it became an annual publication.\n\nThe Pat Navolanic Memorial Award was established in 1966 in honor of Patrick Navolanic, student body president and Valedictorian of the Class of 1963, who is remembered for being extremely active in school activities, and who died of asphyxiation in December 1965 while studying abroad in France. The award is given to the graduating senior who best exemplifies Navolanic's leadership traits, scholarship skills and athletic prowess, as decided by a council of electors representing all student organizations and sports teams on campus. The winner receives a scholarship in the amount of $2,500 and finalists receive $300. The scholarship money is made possible by a financial endowment, as well as generous donations from students, teachers, alumni and the community.\n\n\"Statistics for 2007–2008 School Year\" \n\n\n\n"}

He was the father of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and the younger brother of Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), the 26th president of the United States. Elliott and Theodore were of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts; Eleanor later married her Hyde Park distant cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882–1945), the 32nd President.\n\nElliott Roosevelt was the third of the four children of Theodore Roosevelt Sr. (1831–1878) and Martha Stewart \"Mittie\" Bulloch (1835–1884). In addition to elder brother Theodore Jr., he had a younger sister named Corinne (1861–1933) and an elder sister named Anna (1855–1931), who was known as \"Bamie\". Mittie's brothers Irvine (1842–1898) and James (1823–1901) were Civil War Confederate veterans who accompanied Elliott when he left Europe in 1892 to admit himself into an asylum in Virginia. Elliott had a competitive relationship with his older brother.\n\nAs an Oyster Bay Roosevelt, and through his ancestor Cornelius Van Schaack Jr., Elliott was a descendant of the Schuyler family.\n\nAt a young age, Elliott was academically more successful than Theodore; however, he eventually was surpassed by his older brother. This competition continued into the next generation with their own daughters. Elliott enrolled at St Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire in September 1875. He performed well academically though had to soon withdraw and return home after unexpectedly falling ill. Elliott maintained a charming and winsome personality all his life, which masked a growing drinking problem that started at a young age.\n\nIn 1876 and 1877, young Roosevelt made two hunting trips into West Texas. The first journey ignited his interest in the wilderness. In his second trip, the 16-year-old Elliott was accompanied by a cousin, 23-year-old John Roosevelt. The two traveled first to Dallas and planned to hunt bison in the area between Waxahachie, Texas and Houston, Texas. They also intended to spend some time at Fort McKavett in Menard County. Once in Dallas, however, their plans changed after they met a group of other young men, one of whom was the sportsman Andrew Jameson, whose family made a fortune in Irish whiskey. These young men talked Elliott and John to go directly to West Texas to hunt bison.\n\nOn January 2, 1877, the group of eight men left Dallas. By mid-January they were at a location just west of Graham, Texas where they listened to\" the panther and wolves crying and howling\" and kept their firearms within easy reach. Roosevelt wrote: “It is a glorious free life,\" so exciting that he did not grow homesick. The party passed through Fort Griffin, Texas, where they found in abundance bison, deer, antelope, quail, wild turkeys, and rabbits. When they cooked their game, the scent attracted unwanted guests of wolves and panthers.\n\nOn February 3, Roosevelt entered into his diary: \"[We] made our permanent camp at the bottom of a huge canyon by a fine water hole.” They were probably at the time in southern Crosby County, Texas, some 40 miles east of Lubbock, Texas. After 300 miles of travel, the party soon found hunting bison to be most hazardous. Elliott and John at one point faced a herd of bison stampeding toward them. They waited until the bison were in close range before they fired their weapons. A near fatal incident took place when Elliott was charged by a huge bull, which he had wounded. He barely could reload his rifle in time to fire a shot that struck one of the front legs of a bison. The animal crashed to the ground directly in front of Elliott.\n\nWhen raiders, either other buffalo hunters or the Comanche, stole most of their horses, they had to walk the 140 miles back to Fort Griffin. In other diary entries, Elliott wrote: \"Trails bad-freezing night no water...Again only mud no water freezing hard...Fright ful [sic] thirst.” They reached Fort Griffin on George Washington's birthday and a week later returned to Dallas. Then, Elliott and John resumed their originally planned route. They were back in New York in late May 1877.\n\nOn his father's death in 1878, Roosevelt inherited a fortune and lived the life-style of the idle rich by, among other pursuits, hunting tigers in India.\n\nOn October 27, 1880, Elliott was Theodore's best man at Theodore's first marriage to Alice Hathaway Lee. In 1883, Roosevelt wed a rich debutante, Anna Rebecca Hall (1863–1892), the eldest daughter of Valentine Gill Hall Jr., and Mary Livingston Ludlow. The wedding was held on December 1, 1883 in Calvary Church in New York City. The couple had three children:\n\n\nAfter this point, Elliott Sr. developed a \"casual drinking\" problem, which soon became alcoholism, an affliction to which his son Hall later succumbed.\n\nDue to his drinking problem, Elliott was exiled to Abingdon, Virginia, where he constantly wrote letters, mostly to Eleanor. Eleanor later recalled that on his many horseback riding expeditions with the young children in Virginia, he became attached to \"one girl in particular of whom I was jealous.\" On occasion, he would, to the jubilation of Eleanor, return home for a few days. Theodore Roosevelt became the conservator for his spendthrift brother.\n\nElliott fathered a son with Catherine \"Katy\" Mann (1862–1941), a young servant girl employed by Anna. His brother sent a detective who specialized in likenesses to look at the child and subsequently the Roosevelts settled out of court for $10,000. The sum was placed in a trust, but according to the Manns the child never received a dime as the money apparently was looted by Katy's lawyers. There was some correspondence between Eleanor Roosevelt and her half-brother Elliott Roosevelt Mann (c. 1891–1976).\n\nIn 1894 the 34 year-old Roosevelt attempted suicide by jumping out a window; he survived the initial fall, but suffered a seizure and died a few days later.

{"id": "2158944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158944", "title": "Noctuoidea", "text": "Noctuoidea\n\nNoctuoidea is the superfamily of noctuid (Latin \"night owl\") or \"owlet\" moths, and has more than 70,000 described species, the largest number of for any Lepidopteran superfamily. Its classification has not yet reached a satisfactory or stable state. Since the end of the 20th century, increasing availability of molecular phylogenetic data for this hugely successful radiation has led to several competing proposals for a taxonomic arrangement that correctly represents the relationships between the major lineages.\n\nBriefly, the disputes center on the fact that in old treatments (which were just as unable to reach a general consensus) the distinctness of some groups, such as the Arctiidae or Lymantriidae, was overrated due to their characteristic appearance, while some less-studied lineages conventionally held to be Noctuidae are in fact quite distinct. This requires a rearrangement at least of the latter family (by simply including anything disputed within it). This is quite unwieldy, and various more refined treatments have been proposed in response to it. While there is general agreement on what the basal families of Noctuoidea are, the more diverse advanced group may be treated as one all-encompassing Noctuidae, two huge and two smaller, or even (if Arctiidae or Lymantriida are kept distinct) more than four families, which are in some cases still quite sizeable.\n\nThere are several recent studies suggesting a radical change in the traditional family level classification. Recent works in redefining the families within the Noctuoidea has been carried out by Kitching (1984), Poole (1995), Kitching and Rawlins [1998], Speidel et al. (1996), Mitchell et al. (1997, 2000, 2006), Fibiger and Lafontaine (2005), Lafontaine and Fibiger (2006) and Zahiri et al. (2010).\n\nThe Noctuoidea can be divided into two broad groups, those with a trifid forewing venation (Oenosandridae, Notodontidae and Doidae), and those with a quadrifid forewing venation (e.g., Arctiidae, Lymantriidae, Nolidae, Noctuidae). What has emerged from these investigations is that the quadrifid Noctuoidea form a monophyletic group. In 2005, Fibiger and Lafontaine arranged the quadrifid (forewing) group into several families, including the quadrifine (hindwing) Erebidae and trifine (hindwing) Noctuidae, based on evidence that suggested that the trifine noctuid subfamilies were derived from within the quadrifine subfamilies, so the family Erebidae would not be strictly monophyletic.\n\nLafontaine and Fibiger in 2006 then redefined the Noctuidae to include the entire quadrifid group, believing the Arctiidae, Lymantriidae, and Nolidae to be derived from within this expanded concept of Noctuidae (and closely related to the subfamily Catocalinae). In essence, groups such as the Arctiidae, which had previously been treated as a separate family, were more closely related to groups within the Noctuidae than to non-noctuid families. In order to address this, a revised classification would have meant either recognizing over 20 (often weakly defined) families, or a single well-defined family with numerous subfamilies. The latter was adopted (Lafontaine and Fibiger 2006).\n\nMore recent evidence from nuclear genes (Zahiri et al. 2010) confirms that the quadrifid (forewing) noctuoids form a monophyletic group, but also that this group can be further arranged into four monophyletic subgroups: 1) the quadrifine subfamilies; 2) the trifine subfamilies; 3) the Nolinae; and 4) the Euteliinae. Considering the massive size of the family, and the large number of subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes to arrange into a classification, Zahiri et al. (2010) chose the option of recognizing these four groups as families, namely Erebidae, Noctuidae, Nolidae, and Euteliidae, in addition to the basal trifid families.\n\nThis follows Lafontaine & Fibiger (2006), with the additions of Thiacidinae Hacker & Zilli, 2007 and taxa in Micronoctuidae Fibiger, 2005. Note that the placement of Arctiidae, Lymantriidae and Nolidae as subfamilies of Noctuidae has been largely rejected by subsequent authors. An updated classification for North American Noctuoidea has recently been published (Lafontaine & Schmidt, 2010) and further changes are imminent for a global molecular review of the superfamily (Zahiri et al., in press).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since then, the company has expanded its non-dairy frozen food offerings, and also supplies products to retailers, in-store bakeries, and foodservice providers.\n\nRich's employs 11,000 employees worldwide, with manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Canada, India, China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The company sells more than 2,000 products in 112 countries. Rich's currently ranks number 116 on \"Forbes\" list of America's Largest Private Companies.\n\nIn addition to Farm Rich, the company mostly sells products under other brands it has acquired, such as SeaPak; French Meadow, Casa Di Bertacchi; Byron's Barbecue; Carvel, f'real and Jon Donaire. CoffeeRich is one of the company's few exceptions; nearly all of its products are \"sold not under the Rich brand name.\"\n\nRich's began in 1945, when Robert E. Rich, Sr., sought a replacement for dairy-based whip cream due to milk shortages during World War II. Through the use of soybeans, Rich created a cream that was less expensive than dairy-based whipped cream, yet lasted longer in the refrigerator and could \"remain frozen for more than a year without degrading.\"\n\nIn 1954, the company introduced the first commercial line of frozen éclairs and crème puffs, which are still produced today.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Rich‘s expanded further, introducing CoffeeRich, a non-dairy frozen creamer in 1961. The company also constructed a manufacturing plant in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada the following year. This facility is now known as Rich Products of Canada, Ltd. The acquisition of Elm Tree Baking Co., in 1969, expanded Rich's offerings to include frozen baked goods.\n\nThe 1970s were also a decade of growth for Rich's, with the acquisition of nine new production facilities as well as SeaPak, a company based in St. Simons, Georgia, that produces frozen seafood specialties. In 1973, they bought the rights to renamed the Buffalo Bills stadium to Rich Stadium for $60,000 each year for 25 years ($1.5 million total).\n\nIn 1980, Rich's introduced Freeze-Flo, a process that allows foods to remain soft while frozen. The company introduced another product, On Top, a non-dairy dessert topping, in 1986, which was notable for its packaging – a pastry bag with its own tip. Rich's also expanded its product line through the acquisition of Casa Di Bertacchi, a specialty meat and frozen pasta producer, in 1982, and Byron's, a barbecue and meat producer, in 1986.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Rich's expanded internationally, opening facilities in Mexico, London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Australia, among others.\n\nIn 1997 the company was described as a \"20-plant, $1 billion global food-processing corporation.\"\n\nSince 2000, Rich's has acquired a number of companies to diversify its offerings. These include frozen dessert and bakery mix producer JW Allen & Co., Jon Donaire Desserts, and donut producer Rolling Pin Manufacturing. Rich's integration of French Meadow Bakery and acquisition of World Catch LLC (all-natural seafood) and GLP Manufacturing (gluten-free baked goods) entered the company into the health and wellness food sector.\n\nIn 2005, the company celebrated 60 years as a family-owned company with the \"60 Delicious Years\" worldwide birthday party on March 14.

A sequel titled \"A Very Brady Sequel\" was released on August 23, 1996, and a television film titled \"The Brady Bunch in the White House\" was aired on November 29, 2002.\n\nLarry Dittmeyer, an unscrupulous real estate developer, explains to his supervisor that almost all the families in his neighborhood — except for the Brady family — have agreed to sell their property as part of a plan to turn the area into a shopping mall.\n\nAt the Bradys' house, Mike and Carol are having breakfast prepared by their housekeeper, Alice, while the six children prepare for school. Jan is jealous of her elder, popular sister Marcia. Cindy is tattling about everything she's hearing. Greg is dreaming of becoming a singer (but sings folk songs more appropriate to the seventies). Peter is beginning puberty with his voice starting to break and the numerous titillations he is exposed to, notably sex education and his very attractive teacher Miss Linley. He is also trying to win the affection of the girl he loves, Holly, but his shy and awkward personality prevents him from doing so, or so he thinks. Bobby is excited about his new role as hall monitor at school.\n\nCindy gives Mike and Carol a tax delinquency notice (which was earlier mistakenly delivered to the Dittmeyers) stating that they face foreclosure on their house if they do not pay $20,000 in back taxes. The two initially ignore the crisis, but when Mike's architectural design (which is exactly the same as their house) is turned down by two potential clients, he tells Carol that they may have to sell the house.\n\nCindy overhears this and tells her siblings and they look for work to raise money to save the house, but their earnings are nowhere near enough to reach the required sum. Mike manages to sell a Japanese company on one of his dated designs, thereby securing the money, only for Larry to sabotage it by claiming that Mike's last building collapsed.\n\nOn the night before the Bradys have to move out, Marcia suggests that they enter a \"Search for the Stars\" contest, the prize of which is exactly $20,000. Jan, having originally suggested this and been rejected, runs away from home. Cindy sees her leave and tattles, and the whole family goes on a search for her. They use their car's citizens' band radio, and their transmission is heard by Schultzy (Ann B. Davis), a long-haul trucker who picks up Jan and convinces her to return home.\n\nThe next day, the children join the \"Search for the Stars\" contest. Peter finally builds the confidence to stand up to Eric Dittmeyer, Peter's tormentor and Holly's boyfriend, which earns him a kiss from Holly and turns him into a man. The children's dated performance receives a poor audience response compared to the more modern performances of other bands. However, the judges — Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, and Peter Tork of The Monkees — vote for them, and they win the contest as a result. The tax bill is paid and their neighbors withdraw their homes from the market, foiling Larry's plan and securing the neighborhood.\n\nLater, Carol's mother (Florence Henderson) arrives and finally convinces Jan to stop being jealous of Marcia, only for Cindy to start feeling jealous of Jan.\n\n\nThe film was shot almost entirely in Los Angeles, California, with the Brady house being located in Sherman Oaks. The school scenes were shot at Taft High School in Woodland Hills. Some scenes were filmed at Bowcraft amusement park in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.\n\nThe producers had sought to film the original house that had been used for exterior shots during the original \"Brady Bunch\" series, but the owner of the Studio City, California home refused to restore the property to its 1969 appearance. The filmmakers instead erected a facade around a house in nearby Encino and filmed scenes in the front yard.\n\n\"The Brady Bunch Movie\" was released in theaters on February 17, 1995. The film opened at #1 at the box office with $14.8 million and grossed $46.6 million in the U.S. and Canada. Its television debut was on NBC November 29, 1997 with additional footage not shown in theaters or on home video releases. \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" was released on DVD June 10, 2003 and April 25, 2017. The film has also been released digitally on Google Play.\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 62% approval rating based on 42 reviews and an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though lightweight and silly, \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" still charms as homage to the 70s sitcom.\"\n\nLeonard Klady of \"Variety\" wrote, \"For five years back in the early 1970s, U.S. TV homes were in the thrall of \"The Brady Bunch\". Two decades after their small-screen demise, the clean-cut crew is back in mythic form as \"The Brady Bunch Movie\". Part homage, part spoof, the deft balancing act is a clever adaptation—albeit culled from less than pedigreed source material.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote, \"The film establishes a bland, reassuring, comforting Brady reality – a certain muted tone that works just fine but needs, I think, a bleaker contrast from outside to fully exploit the humor. \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" is rated PG-13, which is a compromise: The Bradys themselves live in a PG universe, and the movie would have been funnier if when they ventured outside it was obviously Wayne's World.\" He and Gene Siskel also agreed that the film offers charmingly bright and silly set decoration but fails to deliver genuine laughs. Common Sense Media said that \"for those who grew up watching the TV show, \"The Brady Bunch Movie\" is deeply satisfying and the best part is its nostalgia. Sure, it's fun to see the Bradys treated as freaks. But the heart of the film is a campy, affectionate interpretation of the TV show.\"\n\n\"A Very Brady Sequel\", directed by Arlene Sanford, was released theatrically on August 23, 1996. It sees the family routine thrown into disarray when a man claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband arrives on their doorstep. The family must then follow Carol to Hawaii in order to set things straight. All of the main cast members reprised their roles.\n\nThe second sequel, \"The Brady Bunch in the White House\", sees a convoluted series of mishaps end with Mike and Carol Brady elected as President and Vice President of the United States. Despite innocent efforts to improve the country, the Brady family is beset on all sides by controversy and imagined scandals which threaten to tear them apart. Although the original actors for Mike and Carol return, the children and Alice are all recast for this film, which was released as a filmed-for-television movie.\n\n"}

{"id": "2159006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159006", "title": "Voucher", "text": "Voucher\n\nA voucher is a bond of the redeemable transaction type which is worth a certain monetary value and which may be spent only for specific reasons or on specific goods. Examples include housing, travel, and food vouchers. The term voucher is also a synonym for receipt and is often used to refer to receipts used as evidence of, for example, the declaration that a service has been performed or that an expenditure has been made. Voucher is a tourist guide for using services with a guarantee of payment by the agency.\n\nThe term is also commonly used for school vouchers, which are somewhat different.\n\nVouchers are used in the tourism sector primarily as proof of a named customer's right to take a service at a specific time and place. Service providers collect them to return to the tour operator or travel agent that has sent that customer, to prove they have given the service. So, the life of a voucher is as below:\n\n\nThis approach is most suitable for free individual tourist activities where pre-allocation for services are not necessary, feasible or applicable. It was customary before the information era when communication was limited and expensive, but now has been given quite a different role by B2C applications. When a reservation is made through the internet, customers are often provided a voucher through email or a web site that can be printed. Providers customarily require this voucher be presented prior to providing the service.\n\nA voucher is an accounting document representing an \"internal intent\" to make a payment to an \"external entity\", such as a vendor or service provider. A voucher is produced usually after receiving a vendor invoice, after the invoice is successfully matched to a purchase order. A voucher will contain detailed information regarding the payee, the monetary amount of the payment, a description of the transaction, and more. In accounts payable systems, a process called a \"payment run\" is executed to generate payments corresponding to the unpaid vouchers. These payments can then be released or held at the discretion of an accounts payable supervisor or the company controller.\n\nThe term can also be used with reference to accounts receivable, where it is also a document representing intent to make an adjustment to an account, and for the general ledger where there is need to adjust the accounts within that ledger; in that case it is referred to as a journal voucher.\n\nAny documentary evidence supporting the entries recorded in the books of accounts, establishing the arithmetic accuracy of the transaction, may also be referred to as a voucher—for example, a bill, invoice, receipt, salary and wages sheet, memorandum of association, counterfoil of paying-in slip, counterfoil of cheque book, or trust deed.\n\nA voucher is a recharge number sold to a customer to recharge their SIM card with money and to extend the card's availability period. Vouchers are typically sold at retail outlets, such as phone stores run by the mobile operator or by distributors, grocery stores, and gas stations.\n\nVouchers are the prevalent form of recharge for prepaid mobile phones in many countries such as Italy and Spain where well over 90% of consumers use vouchers, and the UK where over 60% buy vouchers at retail. In other countries such as the United States, Ireland, and many Nordic countries, there is a growing trend of customers using Card Not Present recharge options such as online payments, or by using their mobile handsets to call the operator and recharge with a representative (CSR) or through their IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. A growing number of prepaid mobile operators such as Meteor in Ireland and T-Mobile USA are offering the option to send an SMS (text to pay), or use handset applications such as WAP or BREW technology.\n\nA voucher can also be used online in the form of an e-voucher. These types of vouchers can be entered when shopping online and the relevant vouchers value added to your order. It can take the form of any code. Many companies have opted to use voucher codes for the last few years but with a massive incline in use towards late 2008 and early 2009. There are many Internet websites devoted to promoting these deals and vouchers online, as well as Facebook groups offering items such as student discounts and 2-for-1 restaurant voucher deals. Many companies have started their business around coupons. It comes under affiliate marketing. \n\nThere are a small number of sites that use a disreputable method of click to reveal method for dropping cookies on the consumer's computer, which has led to the introduction of guidelines for voucher use in Internet marketing.\n\nMost video game special editions come with a voucher for exclusive content in-game. Also, pre-ordering games at certain shops may entitle the purchaser to vouchers to content only available if you pre-order at that store.\n\n"}

{"id": "2159021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159021", "title": "Inter-Services Intelligence", "text": "Inter-Services Intelligence\n\nThe Inter-Services Intelligence (, abbreviated as ISI) is the premier intelligence agency of Pakistan, operationally responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information from around the world. As one of the principal members of the Pakistani intelligence community, the ISI reports to the Director-General and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the Government of Pakistan.\n\nThe ISI consists primarily of serving military officers drawn on secondment from the three service branches of the Pakistan Armed Forces (Army, Air Force, and Navy) and hence the name \"Inter-Services\". However, the agency also recruits many civilians. Since 1971, the ISI has been headed by a serving three-star general of the Pakistan Army, who is appointed by the Prime Minister on recommendation of the Chief of Army Staff, who recommends three officers for the job. The ISI is currently headed by Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed who was appointed Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence on 17 June 2019. The Director-General reports directly to both the Prime Minister and the Army Chief.\n\nThe ISI gained global recognition and fame in the 1980s when it supported the Afghan Mujahideen against the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War in then Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. During the war, the ISI worked in close coordination with the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States to train and fund the Mujahideen with American, Pakistani, and Saudi funds.\n\nAfter fall of the Soviet Union, the ISI provided strategic support and intelligence to the Afghan Taliban against the Northern Alliance during the Afghan Civil War in the 1990s.\n\nThe Inter-Services Intelligence was created in 1948 following 1947–48 Pakistan-India war which had exposed weaknesses in intelligence gathering, sharing, and coordination between the Army, Air Force, Navy, Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Military Intelligence (MI). The ISI was structured to be operated by officers from the three main military services, and to specialize in the collection, analysis, and assessment of external military and non-military intelligence. The ISI was the brainchild of the former British Indian Army Major General Sir Robert Cawthome, then Deputy Deputy Chief of Staff of the Pakistan Army and selected Colonel Shahid Hamid to set up the agency. Initially, the ISI had no role in the collection of internal intelligence, with the exception of the NWFP and Pakistan Administered Kashmir. The recruitment and expansion of the ISI was managed and undertaken by Naval Commander Syed Mohammad Ahsan, who was tenuring as Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence and played a pivotal role in formulating the procedures of the ISI. Following the 1958 coup d'état, all national intelligence agencies came under the direct control of the President and Chief Martial Law Administrator. The maintenance of national security, which was the principal function of these agencies, came to mean the consolidation of the Ayub regime. Any criticism of the regime was seen as a threat to national security. After Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq seized power on 5 July 1977 and became the Chief Martial Law Administrator, the ISI was expanded on collecting intelligence on the Pakistan Communist Party and Pakistan Peoples Party. The Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s saw the enhancement of covert operations of the ISI. A special Afghanistan section (called the \"SS Directorate\") was created under the command of Brigadier Mohammed Yousaf to oversee day-to-day operations in Afghanistan. A number of officers from the ISI's Covert Action Division received training in the United States and many covert action experts of the CIA were attached to the ISI to guide it in its operations against Soviet troops by using the Afghan Mujahideen. In September 2001, Pervez Musharraf appointed a new Director General for ISI, Lieutenant General Ehsanul Haq who was later replaced by the Lieutenant General Shuja Pasha. Some analysts (mainly Indian) believe that the ISI provides support to militant groups, though according to other analysts, these allegations remain unsubstantiated with evidence. General Javed Nasir confessed to assisting the besieged Bosnian Muslims despite a UN arms embargo, supporting Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang, rebel Muslim groups in the Philippines, and some religious groups in Central Asia. National Intelligence Directorate (NID) was formed in 2014 in order to pool and share intelligence gathered by over 30 of Pakistan's intelligence agencies to combat terrorism in Pakistan effectively.\n\nThe ISI is headed by a Director-General, who is traditionally a serving Lieutenant-General (Three-star general) in the Pakistan Army. Three Deputy Director-Generals, who are serving 2-star military officers, report directly to the Director-General with each deputy heading three wings respectively:\n\nThe wing is particularly significant because the port at Gwadar is slated to be a linchpin for the major trade corridor linking northwestern China to the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe general staff of the ISI is composed of military officers of the armed forces as well as civilian officers from the FIA, FBR, Pakistan Customs, police and judiciary. They are recruited on deputations for 3 to 4 years and enhance the ISI's professional competence. Experienced army officers who perform well are given repeated extensions in their service. According to some experts, the ISI is the largest intelligence agency in the world in terms of total staff. While the total number has never been made public, experts estimate around 10,000 officers and staff, which does not include informants or assets.\n\n\nThe ISI is headquartered in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. The complex consists of various low-rise buildings separated by lawns and fountains. The entrance to the complex is next to a private hospital. Declan Walsh of \"The Guardian\" said that the entrance is \"suitably discreet: no sign, just a plainclothes officer packing a pistol who direct visitors through a chicane of barriers, soldiers and sniffer dogs\". Walsh said that the complex \"resembles a well-funded private university\" and that the buildings are \"neatly tended,\" the lawns are \"smooth,\" and the fountains are \"tinkling.\" He described the central building, which houses the director general's office on the top floor, as \"a modern structure with a round, echoing lobby.\"\n\nBoth civilians and members of the armed forces can join the ISI. For civilians, recruitment is advertised and is jointly handled by the Federal Public Services Commission (FPSC) and civilian ISI agents are considered employees of the Ministry of Defence. The FPSC conducts various examinations testing the candidate's knowledge of current affairs, English and various analytical abilities. Based on the results, the FPSC shortlists the candidates and sends the list to the ISI who conduct the initial background checks. The selected candidates are then invited for an interview which is conducted by a joint committee comprising both ISI and FPSC officials, then the selected persons are sent to Defence Services intelligence Academy (DSIA) for 6 months of training. Later these officers are transferred to different sections for open source information where they serve for five years. Officers after five years of basic service are entrusted with sensitive jobs and declared the core team of ISI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian intelligence agencies have claimed they have proof of ISI involvement with the Naxalites. A classified report accessed by the newspaper \"Asian Age\" said \"the ISI in particular wants Naxals to cause largescale damage to infrastructure projects and industrial units operating in the interior parts of the country where ISI's own terror network is non-existent\".\n\n\nThe ISI was also accused to be involved in a scandal the Mehran bank scandal dubbed \"Mehrangate\", in which top ISI and Army brass were allegedly given large sums of money by Yunus Habib (the owner of Mehran Bank) to deposit ISI's foreign exchange reserves in Mehran Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics of the ISI say that it has become a state within a state and not accountable enough. Some analysts say that this is because of the fact that intelligence work agencies around the world remain secretive. Critics argue the institution should be more accountable to the President or the Prime Minister. After discovering it, the Pakistani Government disbanded the ISI 'Political Wing' in 2008.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the ISI and the CIA worked together to send spy planes into the Soviet Union. The ISI and CIA also worked closely during the Soviet–Afghan War supporting groups such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami and Jalaluddin Haqqani, leader of the Haqqani network.\n\nSome report the ISI and CIA stepped up cooperation in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks to kill and capture senior Al Qaeda leaders such as Sheikh Younis Al Mauritan and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the planner of the 9/11 attacks who was residing in Pakistan. Pakistan claims that in total around 100 top level al-Qaeda leaders/operators were killed/arrested by ISI. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Pakistan is paying a \"big price for supporting the U.S. war against terror groups. ... I think it is important to note that as they have made these adjustments in their own assessment of their national interests, they're paying a big price for it\".\n\nOther senior international officials, however, maintain that senior Al Qaeda leaders such as Osama Bin Laden have been hidden by the ISI in major settled areas of Pakistan with the full knowledge of the Pakistani military leadership. A December 2011 analysis report by the Jamestown Foundation came to the conclusion that \"in spite of denials by the Pakistani military, evidence is emerging that elements within the Pakistani military harbored Osama bin Laden with the knowledge of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly former Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. Former Pakistani General Ziauddin Butt (a.k.a. General Ziauddin Khawaja) revealed at a conference on Pakistani–U.S. relations in October 2011 that according to his knowledge the then former Director-General of Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan (2004–2008), Brigadier Ijaz Shah (retd.), had kept Osama bin Laden in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad.\" Pakistani General Ziauddin Butt said Bin Laden had been hidden in Abbottabad by the ISI \"with the full knowledge\" of Pervez Musharraf but later denied making any such statement, saying his words were altered by the media, he said: \"It is the hobby of the Western media to distort the facts for their own purposes.\" U.S. military officials have increasingly said, they do not notify Pakistani officials before conducting operations against the Afghan Taliban or Al Qaeda, because they fear Pakistani officials may tip them off.\n\nInternational officials have accused the ISI of continuing to support and even lead the Taliban today in the War in Afghanistan (2001–present). As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen stated:\n\nThe Associated Press reported that \"the president said Mullen's statement 'expressed frustration' over the insurgent safe havens in Pakistan. But Obama said 'the intelligence is not as clear as we might like in terms of what exactly that relationship is.' Obama added that whether Pakistan's ties with the Haqqani network are active or passive, Pakistan has to deal with it.\"\n\nThe Guantanamo Bay files leak, however, showed that the US authorities unofficially consider the ISI as a terrorist organization equally dangerous as Al Qaeda and Taliban, and many allegations of its supporting terrorist activities have been made.\n\nIn 2017, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accused ISI of having ties to terror groups. In a Senate hearing, Dunford told members of the U.S. Senate: \"It is clear to me that the ISI has connections with terrorist groups.\"\n\nIndia has accused ISI of plotting the Mumbai terror attack in March 1993 and November 2008. According to the United States diplomatic cables leak the ISI had previously shared intelligence information with Israel regarding possible terrorist attacks against Jewish and Israeli sites in India in late 2008. ISI is also accused of supporting pro independence militias in Jammu and Kashmir while Pakistan denies all such claims.\n\nIndia accuses ISI of supporting separatist militants in Jammu and Kashmir while Pakistan claims to give them moral support only.\n\nThe ISI has long been accused of using designated terrorist groups and militants to conduct proxy wars against its neighbors. According to Grant Holt and David H. Gray \"The agency specializes in utilizing terrorist organizations as proxies for Pakistani foreign policy, covert action abroad, and controlling domestic politics.\" James Forest says there has been increasing proof from counter-terrorism organizations that militants and the Taliban continue to receive assistance from the ISI, as well as the establishment of camps to train terrorists on Pakistani territory. All external operations are carried out under the supervision of the S Wing of the ISI. The agency is divided into Eight divisions. Joint Intelligence/North(JIN) is responsible for conducting operations in Jammu and Kashmir and Afghanistan. The Joint Signal Intelligence Bureau (JSIB) provide support with communications to groups in Kashmir. According to Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, both former members of the National Security Council, the ISI acted as a \"kind of terrorist conveyor belt\" radicalizing young men in the Madrassas in Pakistan and delivering them to training camps affiliated with or run by Al-Qaeda and from there moving them into Jammu and Kashmir to launch attacks.\n\nFrom the 1990s, the ISI began to court the Jihadists who had emerged from the conflict against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and by 2000 the majority of militant groups operating in Kashmir were either based in Pakistan or were pro Pakistan. These groups are used to conduct a low intensity conflict against India. According to Stephen P. Cohen and John Wilson, the ISI's aid to and creation of designated terrorist groups and religious extremist groups is well documented. The ISI have been accused of having close ties to Lashkar-e-Taiba who carried out the attacks in Mumbai in 2008. The ISI have also given aid to Hizbul Mujahideen. Terrorism expert Gus Martin has said the ISI has a long history of supporting designated terrorist groups and pro Independence groups operating in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir which fight against Indian interests. The ISI also helped with the founding of the group Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nHizbul Mujahideen were created as the Kashmiri branch of Jamaat-i-Islami. It has been reported that JI founded Hizbul Mujahideen at the request of the ISI to counter the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front(JKLF) who are advocates for the independence of Kashmir. Although the failure of 1987 elections in Kashmir and afterwards arrest of Muhammad Yusuf a.k.a. Syed Salahuddin led to the events that created armed struggle in the valley.\n\nThere have been three incarnations of the group Al-Badr. According to Peter Tomsen, the ISI in conjunction with Jamaat-e-Islami formed the first Al-Badr who resisted the Indian trained influx of Mukti Bahini in Bangladesh in the 1970s. The third Al-Badr (India)\n\nThe ISI supported Al-Qaeda during the war along with CIA against the Soviet government, through the Taliban, and it is believed by some that there are still contact between Al-Qaeda and the ISI. An assessment by British Intelligence in 2000 into Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan showed the ISI were playing an active role in some of them. In 2002, it was alleged that when the Egyptian investigators tracked down Al-Qaeda member Ahmed Said Khadr in Pakistan, the Egyptian authorities informed Pakistani authorities about the location of Khadir. However, the Afghan Taliban at night came in a car and took Khadir along with them to Afghanistan. The next day, Pakistani authorities claimed that they were unable to capture Khadir. The leak in 2012 of e-mails from Stratfor claimed that papers captured during all the compounds the raid in Abbotabad on Osama Bin Laden's compound showed up to 12 ISI officials knew where he was and that Bin Laden had been in regular contact with the ISI.\n\nHowever, the Al-Qaeda has repeatedly labelled Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) an enemy of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda claimed that the Pakistani military and intelligence are their main targets in Pakistan. In 2019, Ayman al-Zawahari in video message labelled Inter-Service Intelligence and Pakistani military a 'puppet' of United States.\n\nHarkat-ul-Mujahideen were founded in the 1980s by the ISI to fight against Indian interests.\n\nUnder the orders of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, in 1984 the ISI prepared a plan which was to be set in motion in 1991.\n\nThe ISI have close links to the Haqqani network and contribute heavily to their funding. It is widely believed the suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul was planned with the help of the ISI. A report in 2008 from the Director of National Intelligence stated that the ISI provides intelligence and funding to help with attacks against the International Security Assistance Force, the Afghan government and Indian targets. However, on 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now \"fractured\" like the Taliban. \"They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall,\" he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive in North Waziristan. \"That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul,\" Anderson added.\n\nThe ISI is also active in Nepal. On 1 August 2007, Abdul Wahab, a Pakistani national and ISI agent was detained in Kathmandu with $252,000 worth of counterfeit Indian currency.\n\nAmnesty International published document over the investigation of ISI over murder case of Saleem Shahzad.\n\n\nSince Pakistan's launch of war on Al-Qaeda, Taliban and other jihadist groups, the country's armed forces, intelligence services (particularly ISI), military industrial complexes, paramilitary forces and police forces have come under intense attacks. ISI has played major role in targeting these groups, therefore it has faced retaliatory strikes as well. , more than 300 ISI officials have been killed. Below are some major incidents when attempts were made to target ISI.\n\n\n\n"}

She starred in at least 78 silent era motion pictures from 1913 to 1917, of which 66 were one and two-reel shorts. She is regarded as Hollywood's first Latin and Hispanic movie star actress.\n\nGonzalez was best known for her role as Enid Maitland in Vitagraph's six-reel feature length drama \"The Chalice of Courage\" (1915) opposite William Duncan. A magazine writer once called her \"The Virgin White Lily of the Screen.\"\n\nMyrtle Gonzalez was born in Los Angeles, California on September 28, 1891, the daughter of Manuel George Gonzalez (1868–?) and Lillian L. Cook (1874–1932). Her siblings were Stella M. Gonzalez (1892–1965) and Manuel G. Gonzalez, Jr. (1898–?).\n\nHer paternal side comes from a native Hispanic Californio family of Mexico, while her maternal grandparents were born in Ireland. Her father was a retail grocer, her mother a former opera and popular singer.\n\nFrom early childhood, Myrtle displayed remarkable dramatic talent, and she had a good soprano voice. She appeared in many local concerts and benefits and sang in church choirs. She later played juvenile parts on the stage with Fanny Davenport and Florence Stone.\n\nGonzalez's first marriage was to James Park Jones. They had one son together, James Parks Jones, Jr. (c. 1911-1917), before they divorced.\n\nBecause she grew up in Los Angeles, the shift of movie production to her hometown was a big advantage for her. Gonzalez worked for such studios as Vitagraph and Universal.\n\nShe appeared in five movies opposite William Desmond Taylor at Vitagraph, the comedy/drama \"Her Husband's Friend\" (1913), the drama \"Tainted Money\" (1914), the comedy \"Millions for Defence\" (1914), the drama \"The Kiss\" (1914), and the drama \"Captain Alvarez\" (1914).\n\nIn many of her roles, Gonzalez typified a vigorous out-of-doors type of heroine. During the last six years of her career, many of the movies she starred in were stories of the snow country and of the forests.\n\nOn December 1, 1917, she and actor/director Allen Watt (1885–1944) were married in Los Angeles. She then gave up her screen work and retired. Watt, who was formerly an assistant director at Universal, where they met, was then in the U.S. Army and she returned with him to Camp Lewis, in Washington State. Her health was too frail for the climate, however, and Capt. Watt was placed on the retirement list so he could return her to Southern California. He went back to work at Universal and began directing.\n\nGonzalez, at age 27, died during the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. At the time of her death, she was at her parents' home in Los Angeles, at 908 West Thirtieth Street.\n\n\n\n"}

Graves of Magna Graecian origin have been found near Tropea.\n\nAlong Tropea's coast, Sextus Pompey defeated Octavius. The Romans built a commercial port in Formicoli, approximately 3 km south of Tropea.\n\n\nA painting of the Virgin Mary from around 1330 hangs in the \"Cattedrale di Maria Santissima di Romania\", a church constructed in Tropea in the 12th Century. The painting is known as the Virgin Mary of Romania and is of Byzantine origin.\n\nAn unconfirmed story asserts that it was carried aboard a ship sailing from the Eastern Roman Empire, when the boat was driven into the port of Tropea by a storm. After repairing the damage, the captain tried to depart, but the ship could not leave the harbour. The bishop of the city, Ambrogio Cordova, dreamed repeatedly that the Virgin Mary was asking him to keep her in Tropea and to protect her. The bishop gathered officials and citizens and went to the ship, where they took the picture. As soon as the painting was brought to shore the ship allegedly left the town.\n\nThe Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to the bishop several times in his dreams, warning him of an earthquake that would devastate Calabria. On 27 March 1638 a bishop organised a penitential procession for the people from Tropea, which meant they were out of harm's way when the earthquake struck. \n\nOther events have been attributed to the Virgin Mary's protection, including Tropea being spared from the worst of the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes and when six bombs fell on the town in Tropea in the Second World War, but failed to explode.\n\n\nVillages around Tropea produce red onions that are well-known in Italy. \"Cipolle di Tropea\" (\"Tropea onions\") have become a synonym in Italy for all red onions.\n\nTropea is twinned with:\n\n\n<br>\n"}

It was historically used solely for the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Ethiopia during the more than 1000 years when the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria appointed only one bishop at a time to serve its Ethiopian flock. When referred to without a name following, it is \"Abun\", and if a name follows, it becomes \"Abuna\" (e.g., \"Abuna Paulos\").\n\nHistorically the Abun of the Ethiopian Church was appointed by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, who had diocesan authority over Ethiopia and the rest of Africa, at the request of the Emperor and, in historic times, after paying a substantial fee to the Muslim government for the privilege. The Abun would be selected from the membership of the Monastery of Saint Anthony. Although several Abuns might be appointed at one time, a request in 1140 to appoint enough to consecrate a metropolitan was refused.\n\nThe candidate frequently lacked knowledge of the native language and even with the local customs of the Ethiopian church. As a result, most Abuns had a minimal influence on both Ethiopian religion and politics. His authority eventually was filled in ecclesiastical matters by the Ichege or Abbot of the Monastery of Debre Libanos in Shewa, the sole possessor of this particular title in Ethiopia. (This title is now customarily held by the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.)\n\nVisitors to Ethiopia at this time, such as Francisco Álvares in the 16th century and Remedius Prutky in the 18th century, were amazed at the mass ordination of deacons and priests with little more than a wave of the cross and a prayer, which was the \"Abun\"'s principal duty.\n\nAfter many centuries, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, the last reigning Oriental Christian monarch in the world, reached an agreement with the Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria, Egypt, on 13 July 1948. This led to the promotion of the Church of Ethiopia to the rank of an autocephalous Patriarchate. Five bishops were immediately consecrated by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria. They later elected an Ethiopian patriarch for their church following the death of Abuna Qerellos IV, the last Copt to lead the Church of Ethiopia. The first Patriarch of Ethiopia was Abuna Basilios, who was consecrated 14 January 1951.\n\nThe current Patriarch of Ethiopia is Abune Mathias, who succeeded Abune Paulos who died on August 16, 2012.\n\nAbuna (Syriac: ܐܒܘܢܐ \"Abuna\", \"ʾabūnā\", literally 'our father') is also a title used among Syriac Christians , Coptic Christians and Maronite Christians to refer to a priest. The title is used either by itself or with the priest's given name (for example, 'Abuna Tuma' for 'Father Thomas'). This title is not used in self-reference, rather the priest would refer to himself as \"al-Ab\" ( \"al-ʾAb\", literally 'the father').\n\n"}

{"id": "2159061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159061", "title": "SPEKE", "text": "SPEKE\n\nSPEKE (Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange) is a cryptographic method for password-authenticated key agreement.\n\nThe protocol consists of little more than a Diffie–Hellman key exchange where the Diffie-Hellman generator \"g\" is created from a hash of the password.\n\nHere is one simple form of SPEKE:\n\n\nBoth Alice and Bob will arrive at the same value for \"K\" if and only if they use the same value for \"π\".\nOnce Alice and Bob compute the shared secret \"K\" they can use it in a key confirmation protocol to prove to each other that they know the same password π, and to derive a shared secret encryption key for sending secure and authenticated messages to each other. The use of a key confirmation protocol is optional, as specified in the IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4 standards.\n\nUnlike unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman, SPEKE prevents man-in-the-middle attack by the incorporation of the password. An attacker who is able to read and modify all messages between Alice and Bob cannot learn the shared key \"K\" and cannot make more than one guess for the password in each interaction with a party that knows it.\n\nIn general, SPEKE can use any prime order group that is suitable for public key cryptography, including elliptic-curve cryptography. However, when SPEKE is realized by using Elliptic-curve cryptography, the protocol is essentially changed by requiring an additional primitive that must securely map a password onto a random point on the designated elliptic curve. (This primitive is called the IOP or Integer-to-Point function in IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4.)\n\nSPEKE is one of the older and well-known protocols in the relatively new field of password-authenticated key exchange. It was first described by David Jablon in 1996. In this publication Jablon also suggested a variant where, in step 2 of the protocol, \"g\" is calculated as \"g = g\" with a constant \"g\". However, this construction turned out to be insecure against dictionary attacks and was therefore not recommended anymore in a revised version of the paper. In 1997 Jablon refined and enhanced SPEKE with additional variations, including an augmented password-authenticated key agreement method called B-SPEKE. A paper published by MacKenzie in 2001 presents a proof in the random oracle model that SPEKE is a secure PAKE protocol (using a somewhat relaxed definition) based on a variation of the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption. However, the proof treats the key confirmation function in SPEKE as mandatory, which is not how SPEKE is specified in the IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4 standards.\n\nSince 1999, the protocol has been used by several companies in a variety of products, typically supplementing other cryptographic techniques.\n\nIn 2014, two attacks are identified against the SPEKE protocol as specified in the original Jablon's 1996 paper and in the IEEE P1363.2 (D26) and ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2006) standards. The first attack allows an active attacker to impersonate a user without knowing the password by launching two parallel sessions with the victim. The second attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to manipulate the session key between two honest users without being detected. The first attack indicates a practical weakness of the protocol while the second attack has theoretical implications on security proofs of SPEKE. During the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 meeting in Mexico City in October 2014, the two attacks were discussed by the technical committee in ISO/IEC SC 27/Work Group 2, and it had been agreed that the SPEKE specification in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2006) should be revised to address the identified issues. The proposed patch involves explicitly defining session identities, and including those identities into the key derivation function in a way that does not change the symmetry of the protocol. The patched SPEKE has been published in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2017). However, the SPEKE specification in IEEE P1363.2 remains unpatched.\n\n describes several variations of the method. This patent expired in March 2017.\n\nStandards that describe SPEKE include IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4. In the latest ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2017) standard, the SPEKE specification is revised from the previous one in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2006) to address the two attacks reported by Hao and Shahandashti in 2014.\n\n"}

He was the only British artillery officer to command an army in the war.\n\nHorne was born on 19 Feb 1861 in the parish of Wick in Caithness, Scotland, the third son of Major James Horne and Constance Mary Shewell. He was first educated at Harrow, receiving an artillery commission from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in May 1880, when he was appointed a lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery. Promotion to captain followed on 17 August 1888, and to major on 23 February 1898. \n\nFrom 1899 to 1902 Horne fought with the cavalry in the Second Boer War in South Africa under Sir John French. He received the brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on 29 November 1900, and in the latter stages of the war served as a remount officer and was mentioned in despatches. Following the end of hostilities in June 1902 he returned to England, leaving Cape Town in the \"SS Norman\" which arrived in Southampton in late August that year. In 1905 he received the substantive promotion to lieutenant colonel and served with the Royal Horse Artillery under Douglas Haig. His military career was unremarkable until 1912 when he was promoted to brigadier and appointed Inspector of Artillery.\n\nWar broke out two years later and Horne was appointed to command a force of artillery under Lieutenant-General Douglas Haig, who commanded I Corps. At the Battle of Mons, Horne distinguished himself with a rearguard action that allowed Haig's I Corps to retreat almost effortlessly; admittedly the German Army made few attacks toward Haig's forces, as they were occupied by Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien's costly defensive action.\n\nHorne fought with distinction in the British Expeditionary Force's (BEF) actions throughout 1914; in October of that year, he was promoted to Major-General and created a Companion of the Order of the Bath. A few months later, he was given command of the 2nd Division. In May 1915, Horne's division participated in the first British night attack of the war, distinguishing itself at the Battle of Festubert; the attack faltered, partly because the artillery ran out of ammunition. The media launched vicious attacks on the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener; the blame was eventually laid on General French who was sacked at the year's end. Significantly, the artillery were reorganised after this fiasco at Horne's suggestion.\n\nIn November 1915, Horne accompanied Lord Kitchener to the Dardanelles, where they organised and executed the evacuation of Gallipoli. For several months, Horne was placed in charge of the Suez Canal defences (and given command of the XV Corps).\n\nMarch 1916 saw him return to the Western Front. He was allotted to the Fourth Army, which was preparing for an attack in the Somme area. In the pre-battle plans, Horne advocated and became an architect of the \"creeping barrage\", a tactic that was used for the rest of the war. On 1 July 1916, Horne's XV Corps participated in the costliest battle of the First World War. His force consisted of the 7th and 21st Divisions. They attacked the villages of Fricourt and Mametz, capturing both on the first day although suffering 7,500 casualties in the process.\n\nThe divisions bypassed Mametz Wood, a position the Germans had heavily entrenched and needed to be captured to allow XV to carry on the advance. As the 7th Division had suffered heavy casualties, the 38th (Welsh) Division was assigned to the Corps and ordered to take the wood. Horne interfered in the division's efforts to attack the wood, issuing conflicting orders and going as far as to ordering a single platoon into action. Due to the miscommunication between Horne and the division's commander, Ivor Philipps was fired and replaced by the commander of the 7th Division. Horne wrote a \"self-serving\" account of this event that did no justice to men of the division or the difficulties they had faced. On July 9, the Welsh launched a full-scale attack on the woods and cleared it by the following day. During their 6 days on the Somme, the Welsh division suffered 3,993 casualties. Historian Don Farr wrote that the reputation of the Welsh division suffered due to the repeated interference by Horne in matters best left to the divisional or brigade staff and his \"inexperience of battlefield command at this level\". With the wood cleared, Horne would lead his Corps during the Bazentin Ridge, the Battle of Delville Wood, and the Battle of Flers–Courcelette.\n\nIn September 1916, Horne was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. After the successful capture of Flers, he was promoted to temporary General and succeeded Sir Charles Monro (after a brief hiatus between 7 August and 29 September when the command was held by Haig's first choice Richard Haking, who was then blocked from receiving the promotion) as commander of the First Army. On 1 January 1917, he was promoted to the substantive rank of Lieutenant-General \"for distinguished service in the field\". His first trial occurred in April 1917, when his troops were sent on a diversionary attack on the fearsome Vimy Ridge, which rose hundreds of feet over the surrounding landscape. French Army commander Robert Nivelle was critical of Horne's plan; Nivelle was the one found incompetent and, after one month of relative failure (and a mutiny), Nivelle was sacked and replaced with Philippe Pétain.\n\nThe attack on Vimy Ridge was spearheaded by the First Army's \"shock troops\" (the Canadian Corps). The ensuing Battle of Vimy Ridge, the first of a series of actions known as the Battle of Arras was successful: supported by Horne's 1,000-odd artillery pieces, the Canadian forces took the ridge in four days, with approximately 10,000 casualties (against 20,000 German casualties). The capture of Vimy Ridge would prove essential to the British Army: it served as the backbone of the British defence from March 1918 onward.\n\nNivelle's failure and sacking lengthened the actions around Arras. With success imminent, Haig began siphoning troops northward, where many would participate in the Battles of Messines and Passchendaele. The First Army served mainly as a diversion and a placeholder until April 1918.\n\nIn April, the Germans embarked on the Spring Offensive which was similar to the Allied Somme Offensive two years previously. At first, the attack was successful. On Horne's front, nine German divisions attacked his weak left flank which was manned by two exhausted Portuguese divisions. The Germans advanced six miles to the banks of the River Lawe, where they were repulsed by the 55th and 51st (Highland) Divisions.\n\nAfter this final German offensive, the British took the initiative permanently. Haig's forces embarked on the Hundred Days Offensive, which ended the war; Horne's troops distinguished themselves in the lengthy offensive.\n\nAt the end of the war, Horne was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. For his wartime services he received the thanks of Parliament and was raised to the peerage as Baron Horne, of Stirkoke in the County of Caithness. He was promoted to head of the Eastern Command in 1919 and retired from the army in 1923. On 30 July 1920, Horne was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Caithness. He was appointed Master Gunner of St. James's Park, an honorary position he would hold until his death; he was also appointed Colonel of the Highland Light Infantry. He was Governor of the Church Lads' Brigade.\n\nLord Horne married Kate, daughter of George McCorquodale, in 1897. While shooting in his Stirkoke estate in August 1929, he suddenly died of unknown causes, aged 68. He was buried on his family plot. Although by a special remainder his title could be inherited by a male grandchild, his only child, daughter Kate (also known as 'Kitten'), also only had daughters so the title became extinct.\n\nIt was believed that he had not kept a diary and that his wife had destroyed all his letters after his death, although, in reality, his papers had been handed down to his granddaughters, who had kept them safe. The donation of his extensive papers, which include his diaries and letters, to the Imperial War Museum by the family has allowed his career to be re-evaluated.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

By the time Stentor replaced Telecom Canada, internet service was part of the alliance's objectives.\n\nIn practice, Stentor was also an advertising unit, coordinating national advertising and sponsorships (such as sponsorship of the Olympic Games). The nine full member companies also participated in revenue pooling, and could quickly introduce new services to all nine members. Other telephone companies had to negotiate with Stentor or its predecessors to offer such services as 800 and 900 service.\n\nThe alliance controlled the following organizations:\n\n\nOn January 1, 1999, SRCI and SSC were disbanded and their roles reassumed by their parent organizations, with SCNM remaining in place in a modified form.

At the age of eight he started playing guitar and four years later decided on a career in music. When he was 16 he played on his first recording session with the Mamas & the Papas. He developed a love for jazz and was influenced by guitarist Wes Montgomery. At the age of 17 he worked with Lena Horne and Tony Bennett. He studied classical guitar at the University of Southern California.\n\nRitenour's solo career began with the album \"First Course\" (1976), a good example of the jazz-funk sound of the 1970s, followed by \"Captain Fingers\", \"The Captain's Journey\" (1978), and \"Feel the Night\" (1979).\n\nIn 1979, he \"was brought in to beef up one of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" ' heaviest rock numbers, \"Run Like Hell\". He played \"uncredited rhythm guitar\" on \"One of My Turns\".\nAs the 1980s began, Ritenour began to add stronger elements of pop to his music, beginning with \"Rit\" (1981). \"Is It You\" with vocals by Eric Tagg reached No. 15 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart and No. 27 on the Soul chart. The track peaked at number fifteen on Hot Adult Contemporary chart. He continued with the pop-oriented music for \"Rit/2\" (1982) and \"Banded Together\" (1984), while releasing a Direct-Disk instrumental album in 1983 called \"On the Line\". He also provided rhythm guitar on Tom Browne's album \"Funkin' for Jamaica\". He recorded \"Harlequin\" (1985) with Dave Grusin and vocals by Ivan Lins. His next album, \"Earth Run\", was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance. The album's title track was also Grammy nominated in the category of Best Instrumental Composition. \"Portrait\" (GRP, 1987) included guest performances by The Yellowjackets, Djavan, and Kenny G.\n\nIn 1988, his Brazilian influence came to the forefront on \"Festival\", an album featuring his work on nylon-string guitar. He changed direction with his straight-ahead jazz album \"Stolen Moments\" which he recorded with saxophonist Ernie Watts, pianist Alan Broadbent, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Harvey Mason. During the same year, he composed the theme song for the Canadian TV series \"Ramona\".\n\nIn 1991 Ritenour and keyboardist Bob James formed the group Fourplay. He left the group in 1998 and was replaced by Larry Carlton. He released the career retrospective \"Overtime\" in 2005. \"Smoke n' Mirrors\" came out the next year with the debut of his thirteen-year-old son, Wesley, on drums.\n\nCelebrating his fifty years as a guitarist in 2010, Ritenour released \"6 String Theory\", a title that refers to six musical areas covered by the use of guitar.\n\nRitenour has been a judge for the Independent Music Awards.\n\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Ritenour has received one award out of sixteen nominations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These moths are found only in the New World, with most taxa occurring in the Neotropics. Adult moths are externally similar to those belonging to the some of the other Macroheterocera families Bombycoidea and Drepanoidea, and thus have been variously treated as belonging to either one of these or other superfamilies.\n\nMimallonids are restricted to the New World, and are distributed in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean (specifically Cuba and The Bahamas). The vast majority of genera and species are found in the tropical regions of the New World, with only four described species from the United States.\n\nNot much has been published on the natural history of adult Mimallonidae, though most species are thought to be nocturnal. At least three species have diurnal males. Young caterpillars live inside of folded leaves or beneath silken networks, and build portable or semi-portable cases out of silk, frass, and plant material as they grow. The cases are open on either end and vary from irregular in structure to spindle-shaped. The openings of the cases can be blocked by the head and/or the flattened anal plate of the last segment of the body. The sack-like case-making behavior of the caterpillars have earned them the common name \"sack-bearers\".\n\nMimallonidae larvae feed on several families of plants, including (but not limited to): Anacardiaceae, Clusiaceae, Combretaceae, Fagaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Research at the Area de Conservación, Guanacaste, Costa Rica has resulted in the rearing of many species of Mimallonidae, including some from several additional families of plants.\n\nThe current consensus, especially in works based on phylogenetic results, consider Mimallonidae to be the sole family of Mimallonoidea. Other phylogenetic studies of all major Lepidoptera lineages support the placement of Mimallonidae as sister to all Macroheterocera, but within the broader clade Obtectomera. This phylogenetic placement means that mimallonid moths are not more closely related to any one family of Lepidoptera, but are equally related (share a common ancestor with) all members of the extremely diverse clade Macroheterocera. Morphological features, particularly of the larvae, support the uniqueness of this family and distinctness from Macroheterocera.\n\nThe systematic relationships with Mimallonidae have been subject to two revisions, resulting in two different classification schemes. William Schaus revised the family and named most of the genera, he then separated the genera into two subfamilies: Lacosominae and Mimalloninae. These subfamilies were based on the presence (Lacosominae) or the absence (Mimalloninae) of the frenulum. It was later realized that this character varies within genera, and thus was deemed a sympleisiomorphy. Using molecular phylogenetics, specifically with the technique of anchored hybrid enrichment, the family was reorganized based on the recognition and naming of robustly supported clades, which were further strengthened with morphological apomorphies. The clades which were robustly supported across all analyses were assigned subfamily status, resulting in recognition of seven subfamilies in Mimallonidae. Using both molecular and morphological phylogenetics, all 42 genera (including some newly described ones) were assigned to the named clades. The 300+ species of the family, too, have been formally classified according to their phylogenetic arrangement.\n\nRecently, many of the species formally placed in the genus \"Cicinnus\" have been transferred to \"Gonogramma\", making \"Gonogramma\" one of the most diverse mimallonid genera.\n\nBelow are the named clades of Mimallonidae, with their constituent genera assigned to their subfamily and tribe (wherever applicable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMimallonidae have been reported as pests of some economically significant crops. In Surinam, \"Mimallo amilia\" has been noted as a pest of guava (\"Psidium gaujava\"). In Brazil, \"M. amilia\" is a known pest of eucalyptus (\"Eucalyptus urophylla\") and \"Psychocampa callipius\" a pest of cashew (\"Anacardium occidentale\").\n\nIn addition to some Mimallonidae species being regarded as pests, others have been considered as potential biological controls of invasive plants. Species belonging to the genus \"Druentica\" have been considered as potential control agents of \"Miconia calvescens\" (where it is invasive throughout the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Australia) and \"Clidemia hirta\" in Hawaii. \"Aceclostria mus\" has been evaluated as a potential control agent of the Brazilian pepper tree (\"Schinus terebinthifolius\") in the United States.\n\n"}

The gift would instead revert to the residuary estate or be granted under the law of intestate succession.\n\nIf the deceased beneficiary was intended to inherit part or all of the residuary estate, then that portion of the estate would pass by intestate succession, as though the testator had left no will. This rule is referred to as the doctrine of no residue of a residue, because the portion of the residuary estate that did not itself pass under the will could not be considered part of the residuary estate at all.\n\nUnder section 2-604(b) of the uniform probate code, \"if the residue is devised to two or more persons, the share of a residuary devisee that fails for any reason passes to the other residuary devisee, or to other residuary devisees in proportion to the interest of each in the remaining part of the residue.\" Simply put, if there are two parties in the remainder and one has not survived, the entirety of the remainder goes to the surviving residuary devisee or devisees.\n\nIn jurisdictions which have adopted the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act, or the 1991 version of the Uniform Probate Code (but not the previous Uniform Probate Code), any devisee who dies within 120 hours \"after\" the testator is legally considered to have died \"before\" the testator. In such jurisdictions, only a devisee who survives more than 120 hours after the testator is considered to have met this \"statutory survival test.\"\n\nMost common-law jurisdictions have enacted an anti-lapse statute to address this situation. The anti-lapse statute \"saves\" the bequest if it has been made to parties specified in the statute, usually members of the testator's immediate family, if they had issue that survived the testator. For example, the New York anti-lapse statute specifies brothers, sisters, and issue, specifically. If the anti-lapse statute does indeed apply, then the issue of the deceased beneficiary will inherit whatever was willed to the beneficiary. The testator can prevent the operation of an anti-lapse statute by providing that the gift will only go to the named beneficiary \"if\" that beneficiary survives the testator, or by simply stating in the will that the anti-lapse statute does not apply.\n\nAnother modification to the common law of lapse is the elimination of the \"no residue of a residue\" rule where multiple beneficiaries are named to inherit the residue. The modern view is that where a beneficiary was intended to inherit part of the residuary estate who predeceases the testator, and that beneficiary is not covered by the anti-lapse statute, then that beneficiary's inheritance will return to the residuary estate, to be inherited by the other beneficiaries to whom the residue has been willed.\n"}

{"id": "2159154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159154", "title": "Zhang Zai", "text": "Zhang Zai\n\nZhang Zai () (1020–1077) was a Chinese philosopher, essayist, politician, writer, and cosmologist. He is most known for laying out four ontological goals for intellectuals: To build up the manifestations of Heaven and Earth's spirit, to build up good life for the populace, to develop past sages' endangered scholarship, and to open up eternal peace.\n\nZhang Zai was born in 1020 CE in Hengqu, province of Shaanxi. In his childhood he showed interest in military affairs, but began to study the Confucian texts. Like many Song philosophers, Zhang was initially frustrated with Confucian thought and studied Buddhism along with Daoism for a number of years. But, he decided that \"The Way\" could not be found in Buddhism or Daoism and resorted back to Confucian texts. His exploration of diverse religious thought had a major impact on his own ideals. In 1056 CE Zhang lectured on the Classic of Changes, which would be known as one of his most memorable works. It is suspected that around this time Zhang had first met the Cheng brothers. After passing the highest level of the civil service examinations, he held several minor government posts.\n\nIn 1069 CE Zhang was suggested to the Emperor and given a place in the capital's government, but not long after he ran into disagreement with the prime minister and retired to his home Hengqu, where he spent his time studying and teaching. This was likely the most productive period of his life for developing and spreading his own philosophical views. In 1076 CE he finished his most significant work, Correcting Ignorance, and presented it to his disciples. Later in 1076 CE he was summoned back to the capital and restored to a high ranked position. However, in the winter he became sick and was forced to resign again. He never reached his home town of Hengqu, dying on the road in 1077. Zhang was enshrined in the Confucian temple in 1241 for his work. Many of Zhang's writings have been lost. Zhu Xi collected selections of Zhang's writings in his anthology of Song Study of the Way known as Reflections on Things at Hand . His most important surviving works are probably his commentary on the Changes and Correcting Ignorance.\n\nAfter Zhang Zai's death most of his pupils became involved with the Cheng brothers' (Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao) school. His thought became known for the most part through the efforts of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi. Zhu Xi honoured Zhang as one of the founders of the Study of the Way.\n\nZhang Zai's metaphysics is largely based on the Classic of Changes. According to Zhang, all things of the world are composed of a primordial substance called qi. For Zhang, qi includes matter and the forces that govern interactions between matter, yin and yang. In its dispersed, rarefied state, qi is invisible and insubstantial, but when it condenses it becomes a solid or liquid and takes on new properties. All material things are composed of condensed qi: rocks, trees, even people. There is nothing that is not qi. Thus, in a real sense, everything has the same essence, an idea which has important ethical implications. The most significant contribution of Zhang Zai to Chinese philosophy is his concern of qi as the basis of his ontocosmology. The qi or vital force is, according to Zhang Zai, the fundamental substance by which all processes of the universe can be explained. First of all, according to Zhang Zai, the qi or vital force is something forever in the process of changing. Second, the perpetual change of the vital force follows a definite pattern of activity according to the two principles, the yin and yang. The changes undergone by qi result from the perpetual activity of the yin and yang principles. Zhang Zai's conclusion is that there is nothing in the universe that cannot be explained in terms of the interaction of the twofold activity of qi. Third, the change of anything from condensation to dispersion, or from visibility to invisibility does not imply the idea of quantitative extinction of the thing in question. Fourth, Zhang Zai stresses the fact that although the creation and transformation of manifold things can be reduced to one uniform pattern (the interaction of the yin and yang) nothing in the entire universe is the repetition of something else. As an example presented by Zhang Zai, there are no two persons whose minds are exactly alike. Fifth, the perpetual motion of the physical world is not originally caused by any outside force. He states that the cosmos depends on nothing to be its first mover, for the qi as such is a vital and self-moving force that alone makes all change and motion possible (Huang (1968)).\n\nNeo-Confucians primarily valued Zhang Zai's doctrine of the sage \"forming one body with the universe.\" This doctrine represents both the Confucian contiguity with its classical Confucian heritage and an enlargement of the Neo-Confucian system. At the center of Zhang Zai's teaching is the idea of ren, humaneness or human-heartedness, in many ways the salient teaching of the classical Confucian tradition. This basic quality, which was for Confucius and Mencius the bond between human society and the ways of Heaven (tian) and hence fundamental to the underlying moral structure of the universe, was expanded by Zhang Zai to encompass the universe itself, since for the sage to form \"one body with the universe\" suggests the complementarity and fundamental identify of microcosm and macrocosm. The doctrine illustrates as well Zhang Zai's belief in the fundamental goodness and purpose of the universe and in the potential of the individual to realize the ideal of the sage. In the teaching of \"forming one body with the universe,\" Zhang Zai also claimed to distinguish Confucianism clearly from Buddhism and Daoism. For him the universe and its processes have a real existence. In turn, human life is looked upon as intrinsically valuable and ultimately the very foundation for the realization of sagehood. For Zhang Zai, such a view is clearly distinguishable from Daoism and Buddhism, both of which require a radical departure from the universe as it is given in order to fulfill the soteriological quest. In Zhang Zai's terms, Daoism and Buddhism both emphasize escape from the world, while Confucianism finds fulfillment and ultimate identity precisely within the changes found in this world, a world of qi rather than of emptiness. The sage accepts the ultimate reality of qi and its inherent goodness, he acknowledges the infusion of ren throughout the very structure of the universe itself, and thus he can fulfill the ideal of the sage, \"forming one body with the universe.\"\n\nZhang Zai's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (五经博士; 五經博士; Wǔjīng Bóshì).\n\nIn 1452 Wujing Boshi was bestowed upon the offspring of Mengzi-Meng Xiwen 孟希文 56th generation and Yan Hui-Yan Xihui 顔希惠 59th generation, the same was bestowed on the offspring of Zhou Dunyi-Zhou Mian 週冕 12th generation, the two Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi-Chen Keren 程克仁 17th generation), Zhu Xi-Zhu Ting 朱梴 (Zhu Chan?) 9th generation, in 1456-1457, in 1539 the same was awarded to Zeng Can's offspring-Zeng Zhicui 曾質粹 60th generation, in 1622 the offspring of Zhang Zai received the title and in 1630 the offspring of Shao Yong.\n\n\n\n"}

The company produces the Accuracy International Arctic Warfare series of precision sniper rifles. The company was established in 1978 by British Olympic shooting gold medallist Malcolm Cooper, MBE (1947–2001), Sarah Cooper, Martin Kay, and the designers of the weapons, Dave Walls and Dave Caig. The founders were professional international or national target shooters. Accuracy International's high-accuracy sniper rifles are used internationally in military units and police departments.\n\nAccuracy International went into liquidation in 2005, and was bought by a British consortium including the original design team of Dave Walls and Dave Caig.\n\nAs of 2014, the company was equally owned by two directors, Dave Walls and Tom Irwin along with Paul Bagshaw. Dave Caig remains in the business as a consultant.\n\nThe rifles are hand-built. The Arctic Warfare Super Magnum (AWSM) held the world record for the longest confirmed combat kill up until May 2017.\n\nThe rifle stock design is designed for good ergonomics. The comfort in holding the rifle and the reduced recoil aids accuracy.\n\nThe barrel is interchangeable with other calibres; this can be done in the field in about 15 minutes. With the barrel clamped in a barrel vice, the barrel is removed from the action, and another one screwed into the action and tightened in place with a torque wrench. Newer versions of Accuracy International rifles including the AX, AT (Accuracy Tactical), and AXMC (AX Multi-Calibre) feature a switch-barrel system that allow the user to change out the barrel with only the use of a 4mm hex wrench, allowing field barrel changes in under a minute.\n\nThe inherent accuracy of the rifle is due to the action being bolted with four screws and permanently bonded with epoxy material to an aluminium chassis which extends the entire length of the rifle stock, to which all major rifle components are in turn attached. As it keeps the action from moving away from zero (determined by the alignment of the scope to the rifle bore rather than the alignment of the action to the stock) the accuracy of the rifle is very high. Adding a folding stock handle, this sniper rifle can be used for both HALO insertions and walking deployments of sniper forces.\n\nAccuracy International introduced their new AS50 .50 BMG calibre semi-automatic rifle at the 2005 SHOT Show in Las Vegas and their new AX Series at the 2010 Shot Show in Las Vegas.\n\nThe UK government announced in March 2008 the award of an £11 million contract to produce rifles for the British Army.\n\nAccuracy International's distribution in United States is managed by the American division of AI, Accuracy International USA. There are only two distributors of Accuracy International in the United States, Eurooptic and Mile High Shooting.\n\nDifferent Accuracy International rifle models come with a variety of proprietary magazines.\n\nThe \"AICS-style\" short action box magazine has gained wide acceptance as a \"de facto\" standard for bolt action rifles. The AICS magazine was originally manufactured for the Accuracy International Chassis System, but can now be found on several production rifles, such as the SIG Sauer CROSS, the Ruger Gunsite Scout, Ruger Precision Rifle, some Ruger American Rifle models and some new production models by Remington (Model 700 PCR, 700 Tactical Chassis 700 Magpul, and 700 Magpul Enhanced). AICS-style magazines can also be found on many custom rifles, and aftermarket conversion kits (known as \"bottom metals\") are available for several different rifle models and are made by several different manufacturers. Many conversion kits require fitting (\"inletting\") by a gunsmith.\n\nIn addition to Accuracy International, there are now many aftermarket manufacturers offering AICS-style magazines, such as Magpul, and Modular Driven Technologies (MDT).\n\nExamples of other popular magazines designs other than the AICS-style includes the STANAG magazine (for 5.56x45 mm length cartridges) and SR-25 pattern magazine (for 7.62x51 mm length cartridges).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2159179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159179", "title": "Security certificate", "text": "Security certificate\n\nIn Canadian law, a security certificate is a mechanism by which the Government of Canada can detain and deport foreign nationals and all other non-citizens living in Canada. The federal government may issue a certificate naming a permanent resident or any other non-citizen suspected of violating human rights, of having membership within organized crime, or is perceived to be a threat to national security. Subjects of a certificate are inadmissible to Canada and are subject to a removal order. Where the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual named in the certificate is a danger to national security, to the safety of any person or is unlikely to participate in any court proceedings, the individual can be detained. The entire process is subject to a limited form of review by the Federal Court.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the overarching agency dealing with the law, the security certificate provision has existed in \"one form or another for over 20 years.\" Its use has been documented at least as far back as 1979, the year after they were implemented. It is housed within the parameters of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (formerly the Immigration and Refugee Act, which replaced the Immigration Act in 1976). It was amended and took on its present structure in 1991, with an additional amendment in 2002.\n\nThe security certificate process (sections 33 and 77 to 85 of IRPA) was found to be in violation of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in the landmark Charkaoui case on 23 February 2007. The Supreme Court suspended the effect of its ruling for one year. On 22 October 2007, the Conservative government introduced a bill to amend the security certificate process by introducing a \"special advocate\", lawyers who would be able to view the evidence against the accused. However, these lawyers would be selected by the Justice minister, would only have access to a \"summary\" of the evidence, and would not be allowed to share this information with the accused, for example in order to ask for clarifications or corrections. The amendments are modelled on a much-criticized process already in use in the United Kingdom. The bill amending Canada's security certificate regime, with support from the Conservatives and the opposition Liberal Party, was passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent in February 2008, just days before the court-imposed deadline.\n\nCertificates are governed by the \"Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\". The certificate is prepared by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and signed by the Solicitor General of Canada (ministerial post superseded by the Minister of Public Safety) or the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration when a non-citizen, either a permanent resident, refugee or foreign national located in Canada, is deemed to be inadmissible on the grounds that the subject is suspected to be a threat to national security, or has violated human rights abroad, or is involved with organized crime. The signed certificate is then referred to a Federal Court judge who reviews the evidence prepared by CSIS. Hearsay is admissible as evidence. All or part of the evidence may be heard in secret, in the absence of the subject of the certificate, if the judge deems that airing it publicly may hurt national security or put the safety of any individual at risk. There is no provision for such evidence or precise allegations to be revealed to the subject being detained or to his or her lawyer, though the judge may provide a summary of the evidence provided. Key terms, such as \"national security\", are not defined in the Act.\n\nIf the judge determines that the certificate is not \"reasonable\" (the order of proof used in security certificate cases), the certificate is quashed. If the judge decides that it is \"reasonable\", then the certificate becomes a removal order. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that the Federal Court's decision can be appealed \"only if the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question\".\n\nIn the case of refugees and refugee applicants, the named person is automatically detained, without the opportunity to apply for release on bail until 120 days after the certificate is upheld by a Federal Court judge. In the case of Permanent Residents, where the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual named in the certificate is a danger to national security, to the safety of any person or is unlikely to participate in any court proceedings, the individual can be detained, with the opportunity to apply for release on bail every six months from the beginning of their detention.\n\nAn individual may be held for several years, without any criminal charges being laid, before the review is completed.\n\nIn practice, the fact that there is often a risk of torture on the one hand, and a limited legal opportunity to challenge detention, on the other, has meant that named individuals are neither released from prison nor deported after the certificate is upheld.\n\nAmnesty International wrote of several security certificate detainees on 2 February 2007, “Their detention has truly become tantamount to being indefinite as they have limited choices: either remain detained while continuing to pursue legal challenges to the unjust procedure that governs their cases, or agree to be returned to countries where Amnesty International believes they face a serious risk of torture.”\n\nA recent trend has been towards releasing detainees under strict conditions or transferring them to house arrest.\n\nPeople named under certificates are exempted from legal provisions designed to prevent deportations to risk of torture or other human rights abuse. The government's position, following its interpretation of the Supreme Court Suresh ruling, is that a named individual can be deported even if it is found that they risk torture or death.\n\nAdil Charkaoui's security certificate was quashed in October 2009 by the Federal Court. Hassan Almrei's security certificate was quashed in December 2009. Three others remain imprisoned under house arrest. The conditions of the three people subject to outstanding certificates are as follows:\n\n\nIn addition to the three people who currently have cases pending, twenty others have been charged under Security Certificate legislation since 1991.\n\nThe families of the detainees, supported by thousands of individuals across Canada, have campaigned against the security certificate, arguing that they violate the guarantees of equality and fundamental justice enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, creating a two-tiered justice system and allowing individuals to be detained indefinitely, on the basis of secret suspicions, under threat of deportation to torture.\n\nCriticism related to violations of civil liberties and due process include the fact that allegations are vague and general, key terms are not defined, precise allegations do not exist or are not disclosed, the low order of proof effectively reverses the burden of proof so that the named person has to prove his innocence, the lack of disclosure of information in the file, the fact that information provided to the court can include hearsay and is known to have included information produced under torture, the fact that evidence has been tainted by destruction of evidence by CSIS, and the lack of appeal.\n\nAlexandre Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau has been vocal in his criticisms of the certificates and has appeared in court to testify in favour of Almrei's and Charkaoui's release, offering to act as a surety on their behalf. Other well-known figures who have joined the campaign against security certificates include Warren Allmand, former Solicitor-General of Canada; Flora MacDonald, former Foreign Affairs Minister of Canada; Denys Arcand; Bruce Cockburn, Naomi Klein, and Maude Barlow.\n\nThe Canadian Bar Association, Amnesty International Canada, Human Rights Watch, and the Canadian Council for Refugees are among the organisations who have taken a position against security certificates.\n\nMembers of Parliament from all major political parties in Canada have criticised the measure and called for its abolition. Several have offered to become a surety to some of the detainees. The New Democratic Party has called for the abolition of the measure.\n\nThree United Nations committees - the UN Committee against Torture , the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention , and the UN Human Rights Committee - have condemned the security certificate process and called on Canada to reform its legislation. They called on Canada to use criminal law instead of immigration law to deal with its security concerns.\n\nIn the wake of the Charkaoui decision, a new campaign is developing to call on the government to refrain from introducing new legislation. A pan-Canadian \"day of action\" against the introduction of new security certificate legislation was organized on 20 October 2007. It is supported by over sixty organizations and networks, including national unions, migrant justice groups, student organizations, feminist groups, human rights organizations, development associations, community groups, political parties and faith-based organizations.\n\nIn 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the security certificate process as constitutional in \"Suresh v. Canada\". The Court ruled that the operative provisions of the security certificate process do not violate Section 7 of the Charter, but that the \"Immigration Act\" generally does not allow for the deportation of a person to a country where they will likely be tortured. The Court did rule that deportation to countries suspected of torture may be justified in \"exceptional circumstances\". The court declined to define those circumstances, instead stating that \"The ambit of an exceptional discretion to deport to torture, if any, must await future cases.\"\n\nOn June 13–14, 2006, the Supreme Court heard three different appeals from Adil Charkaoui, Hassan Almrei and Mohamed Harkat regarding the constitutionality of the security certificate process. Most of the appellants have argued that the refusal to disclose the evidentiary basis of the certificate violates Section 7 of the Charter. Counsel for Charkaoui also argued that the security certificate process violates judicial independence, the rule of law, and sections 9, 10, 12, and 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nOn February 23, 2007, the Supreme Court released its decision of \"Charkaoui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\". It voted unanimously that the process of certificate review which prohibited the accused from seeing evidence against them violated the \"Charter\". Legislative amendments have been made by the Government of Canada to bring Canada's security certificate regime in compliance with the Court's ruling and were passed in February 2008.\n\nThe case of \"Jaballah v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)\" (2006) challenged the constitutionality of detention under the certificate. The Federal Court upheld the detention. It is currently on appeal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2159182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159182", "title": "WFOR-TV", "text": "WFOR-TV\n\nWFOR-TV, virtual channel 4 (UHF digital channel 22), is a CBS owned-and-operated television station licensed to Miami, Florida, United States and also serving Fort Lauderdale. The station is owned by the CBS Television Stations subsidiary of ViacomCBS, as part of a duopoly with MyNetworkTV affiliate WBFS-TV (channel 33). The two stations share studios on Northwest 18th Terrace in Doral, near the Miami International Airport; WFOR-TV's transmitter is located in Andover, Florida.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on September 20, 1967, as WCIX-TV, broadcasting on VHF channel 6. The station was originally owned by the locally-based Coral Television Corporation. General Cinema Corporation acquired controlling interest in Coral Television and WCIX in August 1972.\n\nThe channel 6 frequency was allocated to Miami by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in June 1957, as part of a minor reorganization nationwide of VHF channel assignments. The channel was reallocated to the city of South Miami when Coral Television was awarded a construction permit to build channel 6 in April 1964. In February 1967, seven months before WCIX went on the air, Coral Television successfully convinced the FCC to move the community of license back to Miami proper, where the station could serve more viewers.\n\nWCIX built a transmitter tower in Homestead, which was southwest of Miami, farther south than the Miami–Fort Lauderdale market's other television stations. This arrangement was necessary to protect WPTV (on adjacent channel 5) in West Palm Beach and WDBO-TV (now WKMG-TV, and also on channel 6) in Orlando. As a result, Miami's channel 6 only provided a \"Grade B\" signal to Fort Lauderdale and was virtually unviewable in the northern portion of Broward County. The station made up for this shortfall in its coverage area by signing on translator stations throughout Broward County and in Boca Raton (part of the West Palm Beach market) in 1972. Initially broadcasting on channel 61 from the First National Bank building in Fort Lauderdale, channel 64 from atop the Boca Raton Hotel, and channel 69 from the Home Federal building in Hollywood, WCIX later added a 1,000-watt translator on channel 33 transmitting from Hallandale. The channel 33 translator was shut down in early 1984 to allow future sister station WBFS-TV to sign on; as a result, WCIX lost significant circulation in Palm Beach County. Channel 69 was relinquished when the full-power allotment it used was activated as WYHS-TV in 1988; the license remained active, however.\n\nWCIX-TV was the first general entertainment independent station in the Miami–Fort Lauderdale market, and the second in Florida, after WSUN-TV (whose channel 38 allocation is now occupied by WTTA) in St. Petersburg converted to an independent in 1965. Channel 6 ran the typical independent format of children's programs, sitcoms, movies, and other local and syndicated programs. WCIX was also one of the very few stations not owned by Kaiser Broadcasting to carry \"The Lou Gordon Program\" from WKBD-TV in Detroit in the 1970s. It was also one of the first stations in the area to offer programming in both English and Spanish to serve South Florida's growing Hispanic population. From the 1970s to the early 1980s, WCIX had widespread cable penetration throughout Florida and was seen on cable systems as far north as Tampa Bay and Orlando. Outside the Miami market, WCIX shared its cable channel space with another Miami station, WKID-TV (channel 51, now WSCV), which presented older movies and sitcoms after WCIX left the air.\n\nThe station was the only general entertainment independent in the market until 1976, when WHFT-TV (channel 45) was purchased by LeSEA Broadcasting and switched a hybrid schedule of general entertainment and religious programs. In 1980, WHFT was sold to the Trinity Broadcasting Network and switched to religious programming full-time, leaving WCIX as the market's lone independent once again. However, it would receive competition once again in 1982 when WDZL (channel 39, now WSFL-TV) signed on.\n\nGeneral Cinema traded WCIX-TV to Cincinnati-based Taft Broadcasting in early 1983 in exchange for WGR-TV (now WGRZ) in Buffalo, New York and $70 million. Under Taft, WCIX (the station officially dropped the \"-TV\" suffix from its call sign in 1984) continued to be the leading independent station in South Florida; the station moved from its original studios on Brickell Avenue in downtown Miami to its current facility in Doral (then an unincorporated area, now a separate city) in 1985.\n\nOn October 9, 1986, WCIX became a charter affiliate of the newly launched Fox Broadcasting Company, and was one of a handful of VHF stations to affiliate with the network upon its launch. The station was essentially still independent since Fox offered only an hour of late night programming at the time (consisting only of the talk show \"The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers\") and would only add two nights of primetime programming by the end of the station's tenure with the network.\n\nAfter losing a bid to purchase then-CBS affiliate WTVJ (then on channel 4) from then-owner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., CBS made a half-hearted offer to buy WCIX from Taft in January 1987. Taft declined, but a month later opted to sell all of its independent stations and Fox affiliates, including WCIX, to the TVX Broadcast Group. However, TVX became mired in debt as a result of the purchase, and began to sell off many of its medium- and small-market stations. Although TVX originally planned to keep WCIX, the company eventually decided that the station would have to be divested. One of the primary factors in the decision to sell was that WCIX was TVX's only VHF station, whereas its sister stations were all broadcasting on the UHF band. KKR sold WTVJ to NBC in September 1987. However, CBS' affiliation contract with WTVJ did not expire until December 31, 1988, as did NBC's contract with WSVN (channel 7), which had served as its Miami affiliate since that station signed on in July 1956. WSVN's owner, Sunbeam Television, was not willing to end channel 7's affiliation with NBC one year early. NBC was thus forced to run WTVJ as a CBS affiliate for over a year—a situation that did not sit well with either NBC or CBS.\nWith the defection of WTVJ looming, CBS made another offer to TVX to acquire WCIX in the spring of 1988. The two sides agreed to a final deal in August of that year. In the interim, channel 6 agreed to air CBS programs that WTVJ chose to preempt. Meanwhile, WSVN fought to retain its relationship with NBC, but later relented and approached CBS for an affiliation deal. CBS turned the offer down and went forward with its plans to purchase WCIX despite its weak signal in Broward County.\n\nThe affiliation changeover officially occurred on January 1, 1989: the entire CBS network schedule moved to WCIX, while NBC's full schedule of programs moved to WTVJ. Fox moved its programming over to WSVN (although the station advertised itself as an independent upon the switch); most of WCIX's syndicated programming inventory went to WDZL. CBS formally finalized its purchase of WCIX the next day. In the case of Miami–Fort Lauderdale, it is one of two television markets in which the Fox affiliation moved from one VHF station to another (the other being Honolulu, Hawaii if stations not operating as satellites are counted, when Fox affiliate KHNL and NBC affiliate KHON-TV swapped affiliations on January 1, 1996) – and the only known instance of a longtime \"Big Three\" affiliate switching to Fox prior to Fox's 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications and other affiliation transactions involving the network that resulted from the deal.\n\nDespite a significant technical overhaul and upgraded programming, WCIX struggled as a CBS station due to its weak signal in Fort Lauderdale. CBS anticipated this issue and, in conjunction with the purchase of WCIX, persuaded West Palm Beach's longtime ABC affiliate WPEC (channel 12) to switch to CBS. WPEC replaced UHF station WTVX (channel 34) in order to give the network a stronger signal in northern Broward County. In 1989, translator W27AQ was launched on channel 27 from a transmitter in Pompano Beach. A transmitter at Coral Springs, W55BO, was launched in 1993. The former channel 69 transmitter license was reactivated on channel 58 as W58BU in 1994.\n\nWCIX's transmission tower collapsed on August 24, 1992, as a result of destructive winds caused by Hurricane Andrew, forcing channel 6 off the air. Within hours, the station resumed broadcasts via the channel 27 translator at Pompano Beach. WDZL began carrying WCIX's newscasts the next day. Within several days, WCIX was back on the air using an emergency transmitter on a borrowed tower near the Dade-Broward line; as a result of being further north, the facility had to operate at reduced power. In the wake of the devastation, WCIX's staff helped create \"Neighbors Helping Neighbors\", a grass roots charitable organization which aimed to help people rebuild. The organization lives on as \"Neighbors 4 Neighbors\", which is still supported by the station.\n\nOn July 14, 1994, Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W) signed a long-term affiliation deal with CBS, part of which resulted in three Westinghouse-owned stations (WBZ-TV in Boston, WJZ-TV in Baltimore and KYW-TV in Philadelphia) becoming CBS affiliates. As a sidebar, a subsequent deal between NBC and a new joint venture between Group W and CBS was reached in November 1994, with CBS selling the channel 6 transmitter facility and license to NBC as compensation for the loss of Westinghouse-owned NBC affiliates KYW-TV and WBZ-TV. In return, Group W/CBS received the stronger channel 4 transmitter facility, license and cash as compensation for the loss of Philadelphia's WCAU-TV, which was being acquired by NBC. NBC also included two of its owned-and-operated stations, KCNC-TV in Denver and KUTV in Salt Lake City (which was acquired earlier that year), in the trade agreement with Group W/CBS.\n\nAt 1:00 a.m. on September 10, 1995, WCIX and WTVJ swapped channel positions. The entire WCIX intellectual unit (CBS affiliation, programming and staff) moved from channel 6 to channel 4, returning CBS programming to channel 4 after a six-year hiatus. WTVJ had been Miami's CBS affiliate from its sign-on in March 1949 until the 1989 switch to NBC. Along with the frequency change came a new set of call letters, WFOR-TV, changing the reference to the station's channel number from its original allocation to its new one. Due to the way the asset exchange deal was structured, the two stations were required to swap licenses in addition to the transmitting facilities. As a result, WFOR-TV legally operated under WTVJ's old license on channel 4 through the end of the analog broadcasting era; however, the studios of both WFOR-TV and WTVJ remained the same at the time of the swap (WTVJ has since moved to a new facility). The translators remained with the channel 6 facility.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, CBS sold controlling interest (55%) in WFOR-TV to Westinghouse, while retaining a minority interest (45%). WFOR became wholly owned by CBS once again when the Westinghouse Electric Corporation merged with CBS at the end of 1995. \n\nSince 1998, through CBS' broadcast contract with the AFC, WFOR has been the primary station for the Miami Dolphins; starting in 2014, with the NFL's new \"cross-flex\" broadcast rules, more games can be broadcast on WFOR. The station also aired local coverage of Super Bowls XLI and XLIV, both of which were played at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nIn 2000, Viacom bought CBS, making WFOR a sister station to UPN affiliate WBFS-TV, which subsequently moved into WFOR's studio facility (Viacom was also the owner of some of WFOR's sister stations under TVX by this time). The station also handled some support operations for WTVX in West Palm Beach until it was sold to the Cerberus Capital Management subsidiary Four Points Media Group in 2007. WFOR-TV and WBFS-TV became properties of CBS Corporation, when Viacom split up its assets in December 2005; the split would be reversed 14 years later, as the conglomerates would remerge, making both stations part of ViacomCBS.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWFOR-TV signed on its digital signal on May 1, 2001. The station ended programming on its analog signal, on VHF channel 4, at 12:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 22. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 4.\n\nOn January 11, 2010, WFOR-TV began broadcasting its newscasts from a temporary set in preparation for production upgrades to broadcast its news programming in high definition. After about two weeks of preparation, on January 24, 2010, WFOR-TV became the last major English-language station in the Miami television market and the last CBS-owned station with a full-time news department to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (Detroit sister station WWJ-TV was technically the last CBS-owned station with an in-house news operation that continued to broadcast in standard definition, but it upgraded its news production to high definition on February 2, 2012; however, it does not produce or air regular evening or late-night newscasts nor does it have a full-scale news department, and had only carried a morning news program at the time of the upgrade). The newscasts on sister station WBFS-TV were also included in the upgrade at that time (WFOR would discontinue producing newscasts for that station in September 2011). The upgrade included a major retooling of the station's news set, the purchase of new studio equipment, changes to master control operations, and the implementation of new graphics. Along with the revamp, a new logo was introduced, which would further emphasize a \"South Florida feel\".\n\nOn December 4, 2017, WFOR expanded \"CBS 4 News This Morning\" from 5–7 a.m. to 4:30–7 a.m.\n\n\nWFOR-TV previously operated two translator stations located in the Florida Keys: W38AA (channel 38) in Marathon and W39AC (channel 39) in Key West. Mapale LLC, which has owned them since at least 1979, now operates them as translators of Key West-based Spanish language station WSBS-TV (channel 22), making its entire service area redundant. Their \"digital companion channels\" are licensed separately from their analog allocations, and have Mapale's own WGEN-TV (channel 8, also from Key West) listed as their primary station.\n\n"}

He capped the season by rushing for 244 yards and three scores in the team's improbable 55–43 victory over the top-ranked Georgia Southern Eagles in the 1998 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game. As a junior, he was a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, and added another school record—24 rushing touchdowns—to his resume to go with 1,846 rushing yards. Shipp finished his college career with 5,383 rushing yards, which currently ranks sixth on the Division I-AA football career record list.\n\nHe signed as an undrafted free agent with the Arizona Cardinals on April 23, 2001. He made the team but played little in 2001, not getting a single rushing attempt. He did return 6 kickoffs. In 2002 Shipp would see many more opportunities. He had his breakout game in a Week 4 win against the New York Giants when he rushed for 92 yards on 17 carries and scored two touchdowns. In Week 11, he rushed for a season high 135 yards and a touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. He finished the year with a team leading 834 rushing yards on 188 carries (4.4 yards per carry) and 9 total touchdowns. \n\nAt the beginning of the 2003 season Shipp's status was somewhat unclear as the team had signed Emmitt Smith in the offseason. Despite Smith's presence Shipp again led the team in rushing with 830 yards on the season. His yards per carry went down to 3.6 however and he did not score a touchdown. He rushed for a career-high 165 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in a Week 7 win. \n\nIn training camp in 2004, Shipp broke his leg and dislocated his ankle, forcing him to miss the entire 2004 season. He did not play at all that year. Following the missed 2004 season Shipp still remained with the Cardinals. In 2005, he was again the Cardinals' leading rusher, but this time with only 451 yards on 157 carries, for 2.9 yards per carry. In 2006 Shipp saw much less action, as the Cardinals had signed Edgerrin James. He rushed 17 times for 41 yards. He did have 4 touchdowns, scoring for the first time since 2002, including 3 touchdowns in one game on December 3 against the St. Louis Rams. In 2007, he had limited duty again, with 15 carries for 41 yards, still backing up James. In 2008, Shipp signed a 3-year contract with the Cardinals. However, he was released by the team on August 4.\n\nOn August 18, 2008, Shipp agreed to terms with the Houston Texans, but was later released on August 29.\n\nHis career NFL stats are 605 rushes for 2,197 yards (3.6 yards per carry) and 11 rushing touchdowns. He has 109 receptions for 912 yards and 3 receiving touchdowns.\n\nShipp signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League on August 25, 2009. He finished the 2009 UFL season with 72 carries for 257 rushing yards, good for fourth in the league. Shipp's Locomotives defeated the Florida Tuskers 20-17 in overtime to win the inaugural UFL championship game. \n\nShipp returned with the team for the 2010 season. The Locomotives won a second straight championship again defeating the Tuskers in the championship game. Shipp finished the regular season with 313 rushing yards (5th in the league) on 117 carries and four rushing touchdowns (tied for second in the league). In the championship game he had 16 carries for 43 yards.\n\nIn 2011 Shipp remained with the Locomotives for a third season, despite the UFL's continued financial problems. In only a four team league, the Locomotives went 3-1 with Shipp as their leading rusher. Shipp gained 164 yards on 49 carries and scored two touchdowns. The Locomotives did not win their third straight championship as they lost in the title game 17-3 to the Virginia Destroyers.\n\nSince retiring from football Shipp has had various coaching stops over the past 4 seasons:\n2012 he became the running backs coach of the Las Vegas Loco's of the UFL.\n2013 he served as a coaching intern for the Arizona Cardinals\n2014 he joined his alma matra UMass as the team's running backs coach\n2015 he joined the New York Jets as the team's running backs coach.\nIt was announced on January 3, 2017, that Shipp along with several other coaches were fired from the Jets' staff.\n\n"}

{"id": "2159211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159211", "title": "Music of the Final Fantasy VII series", "text": "Music of the Final Fantasy VII series\n\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" is a role-playing video game developed by Square (now Square Enix) and published by Sony Computer Entertainment as the seventh installment in the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Released in 1997, the game sparked the release of a collection of media centered on the game entitled the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\". The music of the \"Final Fantasy VII\" series includes not only the soundtrack to the original game and its associated albums, but also the soundtracks and music albums released for the other titles in the collection. The first album produced was \"Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\", a compilation of all the music in the game. It was released as a soundtrack album on four CDs by DigiCube in 1997. A selection of tracks from the album was released in the single-disc \"Reunion Tracks\" by DigiCube the same year. \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\", an album featuring piano arrangements of pieces from the soundtrack, was released in 2003 by DigiCube, and Square Enix began reprinting all three albums in 2004. To date, these are the only released albums based on the original game's soundtrack, and were solely composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu; his role for the majority of subsequent albums has been filled by Masashi Hamauzu and Takeharu Ishimoto.\n\nThe \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" began eight years after the release of \"Final Fantasy VII\" with the release of the animated film sequel \"\" in 2005. The soundtracks for each of the titles in the collection are included in an album, starting with the album release of the soundtrack to \"Advent Children\" that year. The following year, Nippon Crown released a soundtrack album to correspond with the video game \"\", while Square Enix launched a download-only collection of music from the multiplayer mode of the game, which was only released in Japan. After the launch of the game \"\" in 2007, Warner Music Japan produced the title's soundtrack. The latest album in the collection, \"Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII & Last Order: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\", was released by Square Enix the same year as a combined soundtrack album for the game \"\" and the animated movie \"\".\n\nThe original music received highly positive reviews from critics, who found many of the tunes to be memorable and noted the emotional intensity of several of the tracks. The reception for the other albums has been mixed, with reactions ranging from enthusiastic praise to disappointment. Several pieces from the soundtrack, particularly \"One-Winged Angel\" and \"Aeris' Theme\", remain popular and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series such as \"Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy\" and \"Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy\". Music from the Original Soundtrack has been included in arranged albums and compilations by Square as well as outside groups.\n\nNobuo Uematsu composed the music of \"Final Fantasy VII\" in less than one year, matching the game's development time, although he had taken two years to create the soundtrack for the previous title, \"Final Fantasy VI\". \"Final Fantasy VII\" was the first game in the series to be developed for the PlayStation, and while the media capabilities of the console allowed for pre-recorded Linear PCM (often as Red Book audio tracks on the CD), it was decided to generate the music in real time on the console instead, using samples and note data. This decision has been credited as giving the soundtrack \"a very distinctive mood and feel\", forming a strong association for listeners between the game and its soundtrack. Uematsu had initially planned to use vocal performances for the game to take advantage of the console's capabilities, but found that the advanced audio quality required in turn made the game have much longer loading times in each area. Uematsu decided that the quality was not worth the effects on gameplay, though after the release and seeing \"Suikoden II\" (1998, PlayStation), which had used higher-quality music instead, he reversed his stance for \"Final Fantasy VIII\". There was a plan to use a \"famous vocalist\" for the ending theme to the game as a \"theme song\" for the game, but time constraints and thematic concerns, caused the idea to be dropped. Uematsu has stated, however, that the move into the \"PlayStation era\", which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from synthesizers, had \"definitely been the biggest change\" to video game music.\n\nUematsu's approach to composing the game's music was to treat it like a film soundtrack and compose songs that reflected the mood of the scenes rather than trying to make strong melodies to \"define the game\", as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game's new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be \"sad but beautiful\", rather than more overtly emotional, creating what he feels is a more understated feeling. Uematsu has additionally said that the soundtrack has a feel of \"realism\", which also prevented him from using \"exorbitant, crazy music\". The first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic to the game and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu \"a sense that it was going to be a really good project\". He later stated in the liner notes for the soundtrack album that the music for \"Final Fantasy VII\" was his \"greatest harvest\" to date.\n\"Final Fantasy VII\" was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, \"One-Winged Angel\". The track has been called Uematsu's \"most recognizable contribution\" to the music of the \"Final Fantasy\" series, though the composer did not expect it to gain such popularity. The piece, described as \"a fanfare to impending doom\", is said to not \"follow any normal genre rules\" and has been termed \"possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history\". Uematsu approached the piece, which accompanies the final battle of the game, in a different manner than previous \"boss tracks\": as he felt that using his normal approach would cause unfavorable comparisons to his well-received \"Final Fantasy VI\" boss tracks, he instead tried to take a different approach. Inspired by \"The Rite of Spring\" by Igor Stravinsky to make a more \"classical\" track, and by rock and roll music from the late 1960s and early 1970s to make an orchestral track with a \"destructive impact\", he spent two weeks composing short unconnected musical phrases, and then arranged them together into a song, an approach he has never used before or since. The lyrics of \"One-Winged Angel\", a Latin choral track that plays at the climax of the game, were taken from the medieval poetry that forms the basis of Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\", specifically \"Estuans Interius\", \"O Fortuna\", \"Veni, Veni, Venias\" and \"Ave Formosissima\". Uematsu has stated that the intro of \"One-Winged Angel\" is based on Jimi Hendrix's \"Purple Haze\", that the piece revolves around the image of Sephiroth, and that despite the chorus and orchestra, he still thinks of it as a \"rock piece\". He said in a 2005 interview that \"One-Winged Angel\" is his favorite tune from the soundtrack, and in 2004 that it was his favorite battle theme from any \"Final Fantasy\" game.\n\n\"Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\" is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the game, composed by Nobuo Uematsu and produced by Uematsu and Minoru Akao. It was originally released on February 10, 1997 through DigiCube and later reissued directly by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. The soundtrack spans 85 tracks over four discs and has a combined duration of 4:39:53. A limited edition was produced along with the original album, containing illustrated liner notes with several pictures of Uematsu's workspace and personal effects, various cutscenes and in-game screen shots from the game, and a discography.\n\nThe soundtrack covers a wide variety of musical genres, including rock, techno, orchestral, and choral, although the soundtrack as a whole is primarily orchestral. While many of the tracks were intended as background music, reviewers noted the emotional intensity of several tracks, especially \"Aerith's Theme\", which plays during a moment described as \"the most shocking moment in video games,\" and has been described as the most memorable track from the album. The theme has become popular among fans, and has inspired various arrangements. Other notable tracks include \"Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII\". Themes from this track play during several other tunes from the soundtrack, such as \"Words Drowned by Fireworks\", to tie the soundtrack together.\n\nThe regular edition of the album reached #3 on the Japan Oricon charts, while the limited edition reached #19. Overall, the album sold 148,000 copies as of January 2010, with the limited edition selling a further 21,000. The album was well received by critics. Allmusic awarded Uematsu's original soundtrack a five-star rating. Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan claimed that \"for the most part, it's a diamond\", with his primary complaint being the quality of the MIDI sound. He found the tracks to be \"beautiful\" and said that \"One-Winged Angel\" was \"possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history\". Patrick Gann of RPGFan concurred and found all of the soundtrack's tunes to be \"memorable\" and the Original Soundtrack to be \"very worth the purchase\". Philip of Square Enix Music Online, however, disliked the sound quality of the soundtrack and saw several tracks as \"trivial\", though he did note that Uematsu \"has a flair for strong, memorable\" pieces. In 2006, IGN ranked the album as the best \"Final Fantasy\" soundtrack to date and cited the \"gripping\" character themes and \"One-Winged Angel\" in particular as contributing factors. They also named \"One-Winged Angel\" as the best piece of music from the entire \"Final Fantasy\" series.\n\nThe original CDs for both releases were only published in Japan and include only Japanese track names. The official English track names were later added to digital releases of the soundtrack.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\"Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks\" is a single-disc album that comprises a selection of tracks from \"Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\". It was initially released through DigiCube on October 22, 1997 and later reissued by Square Enix on February 23, 2005. While the record was never published outside Japan, the music is available in the North American iTunes Store. All of the pieces are the same as on the Original Soundtrack except for \"Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII\", \"One-Winged Angel\", and \"Aerith's Theme\", which were re-recorded with an orchestra and choir. Some versions of the album also contain a hidden pregap track, which can be accessed by rewinding from the start of the album. This track is an instrumental version of \"One-Winged Angel\" without the choir. The new arrangements were created by Shirō Hamaguchi. The album spans 1:12:24 over 19 tracks.\n\n\"Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks\" reached #20 on the Japan Oricon charts, and sold over 25,600 copies. It received mixed reviews. Gann liked the newly orchestrated tracks, calling them \"incredibly well-done orchestrations\", and said that \"depending on how willing you are to spend money\" they made the album worth purchasing on their own, although he felt the other tracks offered nothing new to owners of the original soundtrack. Chris of Square Enix Music Online, however, felt that while the orchestrated tracks were well-done, the selection of the other tracks was poor and that the album as a whole was \"a lousy purchase for most who enjoyed \"Final Fantasy VII\"s score\".\n\n\"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\" is an album featuring piano arrangements of selected \"Final Fantasy VII\" pieces composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi, and performed by Seiji Honda. The album was released through DigiCube on December 3, 2003 and later reissued by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. It covers a duration of 47:37 over 13 tracks. The album includes light-hearted tracks as well as slower, more emotional pieces, covering a variety of genres such as marches, new-age themes, and jazz. Unlike previous and subsequent \"Final Fantasy\" piano albums, \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\" was produced many years after the release of the original game. As three of the tracks from this album were reused in the soundtrack to \"\", it has been speculated that the album was produced with the intention to provide tunes for \"Advent Children\".\n\n\"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\" reached #228 on the Japan Oricon charts, selling 1,200 copies, and was well received by reviewers, with Gann raving that the pieces were fun to listen to, the performer was \"amazing\", the choice of tracks was \"excellent\", and the album as a whole was a \"spectacular CD\". Sophia of Soundtrack Central concurred and stated that the album was \"quite fulfilling to listen to\" and that it surpassed her expectations.\n\n\"\" is the 2005 CGI film sequel to the original game, and the beginning of the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\". Its soundtrack album, \"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack\", was released on September 28, 2005, containing new material created specifically for the movie, as well as arrangements of tunes from the \"Final Fantasy VII\" soundtrack. Both the original tracks and the arrangements cover a variety of musical styles, including orchestral, choral, classical piano, and rock music; \"Variety\" noted that the styles vary between \"sparse piano noodlings, pop metal thrashings and cloying power ballads\". The tracks were composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Keiji Kawamori, Kenichiro Fukui, and Tsuyoshi Sekito, and arranged by Fukui, Sekito, Kawamori, Shirō Hamaguchi, and Kazuhiko Toyama. Upon hearing each track, Nomura would make some changes, and have the composers re-record the piece. The song \"Calling\" from 1989 by former Boøwy vocalist Kyosuke Himuro was used in the film's credits. Some of the piano tracks are longer than what was included in the movie. The album spans 26 tracks on two discs, covers a duration of 1:21:41. In addition to the regular release, a limited edition was produced with a foil slipcover and a booklet of credits and lyrics. The soundtrack album reached position #15 on the Japanese Oricon music charts, and stayed on the charts for 10 weeks.\n\nA mini-album titled \"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete Mini Album\" was released on April 10, 2009 to coincide with the release of the \"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete\" version of the movie. The new release of the movie included a new ending theme, \"Safe and Sound\", by Kyosuke Himuro and My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way, and replaced \"Water\" with a new song, \"Anxious Heart\". The mini-album was five tracks and 29:17 long. The included tracks on the album were new versions of \"The Chase of Highway\", \"Those Who Fight Further\", \"Sign\", \"Advent: One-Winged Angel\", and \"On the Way to a Smile\", a piece from the \"Final Fantasy VII\"-based anime \"On the Way to a Smile\". A larger album, \"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete: Reunion Tracks\", was released with 21 tracks on September 16, 2009. This album contains the tracks from the mini-album, as well as several pieces that were lengthened for the \"Complete\" film version but not rearranged. \"Reunion Tracks\" appeared on the Oricon charts for a single week at position #108.\n\n\"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack\" sold over 38,900 copies, and was well received by critics. Gann said that \"Final Fantasy\" fans have \"no excuse\" not to buy the album and noted that his only disappointments were that three of the tracks were the same as on the Piano Collections album, and that as a film score, some of the shifts in the pieces make less sense outside of the context of the visuals. Chris Carle of IGN called it a \"jagged but beautiful blend of opera, metal and electronica\", and a \"richly-layered, complex and utterly listenable soundtrack\" while praising the variety of musical styles used and the quality of the pieces. In contrast to Gann, he felt that \"divorced from the film, the score is still amazingly listenable\".\n\nTrack listing\n\n\"\" was released for the PlayStation 2 in January 2006, and its soundtrack, \"Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\", was released a month later. The tracks were composed by Masashi Hamauzu and orchestrations were provided by Yoshihisa Hirano, making it the first \"Final Fantasy VII\"-related soundtrack to not include new material from Nobuo Uematsu. Koji Haishima conducted the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, which performed the music for around half of the album. The soundtrack also contains the songs \"Longing\" and \"Redemption\" by Japanese musician and actor Gackt, and was released through the artist's ex label, Nippon Crown. The album contains a mix of orchestral and rock tracks, with some orchestral performances of slow compositions and marches and both styles of music used for faster-paced \"threatening\" and \"dynamic\" tunes. GameSpot describes the music as ranging from \"quiet, almost nonexistent ambient tunes to dramatic, orchestrated tracks\". The album was launched on February 15, 2006, and spans 53 tracks over two discs, covering a duration of 2:14:22. The limited edition of the soundtrack includes a case which is designed to hold the soundtrack, along with the game disc and the limited edition of the \"Redemption\" single and associated DVD, although these other albums must be purchased separately.\n\n\"Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\" was given mixed reviews from critics. Gann called it \"solid, [...], but not awe-inspiring\" and dismissed the limited edition extras as not worth the purchase. Eduardo of Square Enix Music Online, however, described it as \"nearly perfect\" and said that he \"can, and will, run out of positive adjectives to describe the \"Dirge of Cerberus Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\". It's a work of genius\". The album reached position #19 on the Oricon charts, and sold over 14,300 copies; the \"Redemption\" single sold over 125,000 copies.\n\nTrack listing\n\nThe Japanese version of \"Dirge of Cerberus\" included a multiplayer mode absent from other releases, which contained music tracks not used in the single-player game. \"Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Multiplayer Mode Original Sound Collections\" is a download-only soundtrack album for the multiplayer tracks released through the Japanese iTunes Store and the Square Enix Music Download website on August 22, 2006. It spans 1:07:07 over 27 tracks. The soundtrack includes all the music from the multiplayer mode and some music from the single-player game which did not appear on the previous soundtrack album, including two tracks composed by Ryo Yamazaki for the North American release of the game.\n\nEduardo of Square Enix Music Online also appreciated \"Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Multiplayer Mode Original Sound Collections\", saying that it accented the Original Soundtrack well and that \"Hamauzu and Yamazaki have delivered strongly and, with a decent mix of electronica, orchestral music, and rock, the entirety of the \"Dirge of Cerberus\" musical experience cannot be missed\".\n\n\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\" is the soundtrack of the game \"\". It was released on October 10, 2007 by Warner Music Japan and covers 55 tracks over two discs with a total duration of 2:20:59. The music was primarily composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, with a few tracks provided by Kazuhiko Toyama. It was Ishimoto's second major work, after the soundtrack to \"The World Ends with You\"; the only titles he had composed for previously were \"World Fantasista\", a little-known soccer game for which he was a co-composer, and the cell phone game \"\". The tracks composed by Ishimoto cover a range of moods, from \"harsh and in-your-face\" to \"stunning and lovely\", but were primarily used as ambient background music. The soundtrack also includes a large number of arrangements of tunes from the original \"Final Fantasy VII\" score, as well as a theme song entitled \"Why\", performed by Ayaka. A variety of musical instruments were used for the soundtrack, including piano and synthesizers, but critics noted that Ishimoto used guitars, both electronic and acoustic, more and better than any previous \"Final Fantasy\" soundtrack.\n\n\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\" sold over 13,300 copies, while \"Why\" sold 60,000 copies. It received mixed reviews by critics, with Don of Square Enix Music Online stating that while some of Ishimoto's and all of Toyama's arrangements were excellent, the original pieces that made up the bulk of the album offered \"very little that is actually worth a listen\". Gann was more lenient, praising Ishimoto for writing \"an excellent soundtrack\" and being especially happy with the quality of the arrangements of Uematsu's pieces. Gann did, however, note that because Ishimoto's original works were more ambient, his arrangements, and by extension Uematsu's work, far outshone his own new contributions. He also felt that the theme song \"Why\" was \"generic\" and \"bland\". Sophia Tong of IGN described the album as a \"mixed bag\", stating that some of the arrangements and new tracks were \"fantastic\" while others were \"not all that compelling\", and lamented the overuse of a few themes throughout the soundtrack.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\"Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII & Last Order: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\" is the combined soundtrack album of the original video animation \"\" and the game \"Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII\". \"Before Crisis\" serves as a prequel to \"Final Fantasy VII\" while \"Last Order\" is a side story to \"Final Fantasy VII\", showing some of the same story elements from \"Crisis Core\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\" from an alternate viewpoint. The album spans 27 tracks, of which the first 12 are from the game and the remainder are from the animation. The album was released on December 19, 2007 by Square Enix, and was mainly composed by Ishimoto, with some tunes based on works from \"Final Fantasy VII\" by Uematsu. Many of the pieces composed for the two works were used either directly or in an arranged form in \"Crisis Core\". As this soundtrack album was released after the soundtrack to \"Crisis Core\", these pieces were generally not included in the \"Before Crisis\" album. The album covers a duration of 63:48.\n\n\"Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII & Last Order: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack\" was poorly received by critics. Gann said that \"the whole album is a flop compared to the quality composition of \"Crisis Core\"\" and that the contents of the album were \"the leftovers, B-Sides, and less-impressive tracks from Ishimoto's arsenal of \"FFVII\" music\", especially as many tracks were used in the \"Crisis Core\" soundtrack and not repeated in this album. Chris (also known as \"Dark Cloud\") of Square Enix Music Online agreed, saying that the album \"is probably one of the worst I've heard in a very long time\" and recommended it only for listeners who like \"loud music without much creativity\".\n\nThe Black Mages, a now defunct band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranged music from the \"Final Fantasy\" series into a rock music style, has arranged four pieces from \"Final Fantasy VII\". These are \"J-E-N-O-V-A\" and \"Those Who Fight Further\" from \"The Black Mages\", published in 2003, \"Advent One-Winged Angel\" from \"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack\" and \"Opening ~ Bombing Mission\" from \"\", published in 2008. Music from \"Final Fantasy VII\" has also been used in other games, such as the fighting game \"Ehrgeiz\", and the \"Kingdom Hearts\" series.\n\nUematsu continues to perform certain pieces in the Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy- concert series. The music of \"Final Fantasy VII\" has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as \"20020220 Music from Final Fantasy\", a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including \"Aerith's Theme\" and \"One-Winged Angel\". Additionally, several pieces from the game were performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy concert series, and in the Video Games Live international concert series. The \"Advent Children\" version of \"One-Winged Angel\" was performed at the Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2007 concerts in Yokohama and Osaka, Japan, while The Black Mages performed \"Those Who Fight Further\" at the \"Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007\" concert in Tokyo on July 7, 2007. Independent but officially licensed releases of \"Final Fantasy VII\" music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dōjin music, and on English remixing websites, such as OverClocked ReMix. On September 14, 2007, the OverClocked ReMix community released an unofficial tribute album titled \"Voices of the Lifestream\", a compilation containing 45 arrangements of \"Final Fantasy VII\" music.\n\n\"Aerith's Theme\" was voted into Classic FM's 2012 Hall of Fame in 16th place out of 300 compositions. Elizabeth Davis of Classic FM (UK) notes that \"Aerith's Theme\" is \"one of the most famous pieces of video game music ever written\" and is rooted in Romantic music, and that \"Final Fantasy VII\" helped introduce \"a whole generation to the magic of orchestral music.\"\n\n"}

Made of beef, it is similar in appearance and texture to salami, though somewhat darker in color and typically served as a cold cut or appetizer. Lebanon bologna has a distinct tangy flavor, more so than other fermented meat products such as summer sausage. Hardwood smoking imparts a strong smokiness to the traditionally prepared versions of the product; increasingly, liquid smoke is used as a substitute for this costly time- and labor-intensive process.\n\nLebanon bologna was developed by the Pennsylvania Dutch of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania since before the 1780s and was a common item by the early 1800s, reflecting the slow-cured and smoked sausage traditions of Western Europe. Still produced primarily in that area, it is found in markets throughout the United States and typically served as a cold cut and as an appetizer. In addition to the original, a sweet version is made.\n\nLebanon bologna is slow cold smoked at a temperature below . Curing salts are added to control microbial growth during processing.\n\nTypically, the blended and stuffed beef sausage is aged for 10 days prior to smoking to enrich lactic acid bacteria and allow for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Fermentation occurs during the smoking step, which can last for up to four days. A one pH unit (or more) decline is observed during this step, as well as the development of nitrosohemochrome, the pigment responsible for the red color of cured meats.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2159216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159216", "title": "Compound modifier", "text": "Compound modifier\n\nA compound modifier (also called a compound adjective, phrasal adjective, or adjectival phrase) is a compound of two or more attributive words: that is, two or more words that collectively modify a noun. Compound modifiers are grammatically equivalent to single-word modifiers, and can be used in combination with other modifiers. (In the preceding sentence, \"single-word\" is itself a compound modifier.)\n\nThe constituents of compound modifiers need not be adjectives; combinations of nouns, determiners, and other parts of speech are also common. For example, \"man-eating (shark)\" and \"one-way (street)\". The punctuation of compound modifiers in English depends on their grammatical role. Attributive compounds—modifiers within the noun phrase—are typically hyphenated, whereas the same compounds used as predicates will typically not be (if they are temporary compounds), unless they are permanent compounds attested as dictionary headwords.\n\nWords that function as compound adjectives may modify a noun or a noun phrase. Take the English examples \"heavy metal detector\" and \"heavy-metal detector\". The former example contains only the bare adjective \"heavy\" to describe a device that is properly written as metal detector; the latter example contains the phrase \"heavy-metal\", which is a compound noun that is ordinarily rendered as heavy metal absent an accompanying adjective. In the latter example, however, \"heavy-metal\" functions as a compound adjective that modifies the noun \"detector\".\n\nNote that whether a word sequence such as \"heavy + metal + detector\" implies a \"compound adjective + noun\" or \"bare adjective + compound noun\" depends on the punctuation. For instance, \"heavy-metal detector\" and \"heavy metal detector\" can refer to quite different things: \"heavy-metal detector\" implies a device that detects heavy metals (wherein \"heavy-metal\" functions as a compound adjective that modifies the noun \"detector\"). By contrast, \"heavy metal detector\", without the hyphen, refers to a metal detector that is heavy. \"Heavy\" is a bare adjective that modifies the compound noun \"metal detector\". Thus, \"heavy metal detector\" is a \"bare adjective + compound noun\" sequence.\n\nA strategy to avoid conflation of \"compound adjective + noun\" versus \"bare adjective + compound noun\" sequences is to clearly distinguish the usage of an attributive adjective and a noun adjunct. Accordingly, the phrase \"heavy metallic detector\" unequivocally employs a compound adjective to describe a \"weighty detector made of metal.\"\n\nConventionally, and with the support of modern writing guides, compound modifiers that appear \"before\" a noun phrase must include a hyphen between each word, subject to certain exceptions. Hyphens are used in this way to prevent confusion; without their use, a reader might interpret the words separately, rather than as a phrase. Hyphens join the relevant words into a single idea, a compound adjective.\n\nWhen a numeral and a noun are used in a compound modifier that precedes a noun, the numeral and the noun take the singular form.\n\nMajor style guides advise consulting a dictionary to determine whether a compound adjective should be hyphenated; compounds entered as dictionary headwords are permanent compounds, and for these, the dictionary's hyphenation should be followed even when the compound adjective precedes a noun. According to some guides, hyphens are unnecessary in familiar compounds used as adjectives \"where no ambiguity could result\",\nwhile other guides suggest using hyphens \"generally\" in such compounds used as adjectives before nouns.\n\n\nIt may be appropriate to distinguish between compound modifiers whose adverb has the suffix \"-ly\", such as \"quickly\" and \"badly\", and those whose adverb does not, such as \"well\". The \"-ly\" suffix on an adverb allows readers to understand its lexical category (if not in the technical sense, then at least in the sense of the intended meaning), showing that it is intended to modify the adjective that it precedes and so not requiring hyphenation. \"Quickly\" and \"badly\" are unambiguously adverbs.\n\nOther adverbs (such as \"well\" can commonly be used as adjectives; these adverbs without the \"-ly\" suffix therefore commonly take a hyphen. For example, one could speak of a \"well-known actress\" or a \"little-known actress\". If the compound modifier that would otherwise be hyphenated is changed to a post-modifier—one which is located after the modified noun phrase—then the hyphen is conventionally not necessary: \"the actress is well known\".\n\nFinally, the word \"very\" in a compound modifier is generally not accompanied by a hyphen. Where both (or all) of the words in a compound modifier are nouns, it is seen as not necessary to hyphenate them, as misunderstanding is unlikely.\n\nHungarian orthography describes three types of this modification in spelling, as described in the main article.\n\nJapanese equivalents of adjectives can compound. This is quite common for \"na\"-adjectives, which function essentially as attributive noun phrases, while it is relatively uncommon for \"i\"-adjectives, and is much less common than Japanese compound verbs. Common examples include (noun + \"i\"-adjective) and (\"i\"-adjective stem + \"i\"-adjective).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2159245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159245", "title": "The Lego Group", "text": "The Lego Group\n\nLego A/S (trade name: The Lego Group) is a Danish toy production company based in Billund. It is best known for the manufacture of Lego-brand toys, consisting mostly of interlocking plastic bricks. The Lego Group has also built several amusement parks around the world, each known as Legoland, and operates numerous retail stores.\n\nThe company was founded on 10 August 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen. The word \"lego\" is derived from the Danish words \"leg godt\", meaning \"play well\". In the first half of 2015, The Lego Group became the world's largest toy company by revenue, with sales amounting to US$2.1 billion, surpassing Mattel, which had US$1.9 billion in sales. On 11 August 2017, Lego announced that Niels B. Christiansen would become the new CEO, effective 1 October of the same year.\n\nThe history of Lego spans nearly 100 years, beginning with the creation of small wooden playthings during the early 20th century. Manufacturing of plastic Lego bricks began in Denmark in 1947, but since has grown to include factories throughout the world. In 1961, Lego was managed by Samsonite until 1972 in the United States and 1986 in Canada.\n\nBelow are historical images of the Lego logo throughout the company's existence.\n\nSince the expiry of the last standing Lego patent in 1989, a number of companies have produced interlocking bricks that are similar to Lego bricks. The toy company Tyco Toys produced such bricks for a time; other competitors include Mega Bloks and Best-Lock. These competitor products are typically compatible with Lego bricks, and are often marketed at a lower cost than Lego sets.\n\nOne such competitor is Coko, manufactured by Chinese company Tianjin Coko Toy Co., Ltd. In 2002, Lego Group's Swiss subsidiary Interlego AG sued the company for copyright infringement. A trial court found many Coko bricks to be infringing; Coko was ordered to cease manufacture of the infringing bricks, publish a formal apology in the \"Beijing Daily\", and pay a small fee in damages to Interlego. On appeal, the Beijing High People's Court upheld the trial court's ruling.\n\nIn 2003, The Lego Group won a lawsuit in Norway against the marketing group Biltema for its sale of Coko products, on the grounds that the company used product confusion for marketing purposes.\n\nAlso in 2003, a large shipment of Lego-like products marketed under the name \"Enlighten\" was seized by Finland customs authorities. The packaging of the Enlighten products was similar to official Lego packaging. Their Chinese manufacturer failed to appear in court, and thus Lego won a default action ordering the destruction of the shipment. Lego Group footed the bill for the disposal of the 54,000 sets, citing a desire to avoid brand confusion and protect consumers from potentially inferior products.\n\nIn 2004, Best-Lock Construction Toys defeated a patent challenge from Lego in the Oberlandesgericht, Hamburg.\n\nThe Lego Group has attempted to trademark the \"Lego Indicia\", the studded appearance of the Lego brick, hoping to stop production of Mega Bloks. On 24 May 2002, the Federal Court of Canada dismissed the case, asserting the design is functional and therefore ineligible for trademark protection. The Lego Group's appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal on 14 July 2003. In October 2005, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that \"Trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now-expired patents\" and held that Mega Bloks can continue to manufacture their bricks.\n\nBecause of fierce competition from copycat products, the company has always responded by being proactive in their patenting and has over 600 United States–granted design patents to their name.\n\nLego products are mass-reproduced, packaged and shipped on a large scale.\n\nLego Produktion AG was a major production facility for Lego. It was founded in Switzerland in 1974. At the time of its announced closing in 2001, 30% of the world production of Lego was produced at the Swiss facility in Baar. The Baar facility eventually closed in 2004.\n\nIn April 1962, the Lego Group began producing miniature tires; it became the largest tire manufacturing company in 2011, when it produced 381 million tyres that year.\n\nLego acknowledges the impact of its operations on the environment, in particular in areas such as climate change, resource and energy use and waste. All manufacturing sites are certified according to the environmental standard ISO 14001. The first Borkum Riffgrund 1 wind turbines off the coast of Germany began producing electricity in February 2015, which will help The Lego Group reach its goal of being based 100% on renewable energy by 2020. The company claims to recycle 90% of its waste and that it had made its operations nearly one-third more energy efficient over the five-year period ending 31 December 2013. It is seeking alternatives to crude oil as the raw material for its bricks. This results in the establishment in June 2015 the Lego Sustainable Materials Centre, which is expected to recruit more than 100 employees, as a significant step towards the 2030 ambition of finding and implementing sustainable alternatives to current materials.\n\nIn 2011, Lego bowed to pressure from the environmental campaigning organisation Greenpeace, reportedly agreeing to drop supplier Asia Pulp and Paper, and pledging to only use packaging material certified by the Forest Stewardship Council in future. The environmental group had accused Lego, Hasbro, Mattel and Disney of using packaging material sourced from trees cleared out of the Indonesian rainforest.\n\nLego partnered with the oil company Royal Dutch Shell in the 1960s, using the company's logo in some of its construction sets. This partnership continued until the 1990s, and was renewed again in 2011. In July 2014, Greenpeace launched a global campaign to persuade Lego to cease producing toys carrying the oil company Shell's logo in response to Shell's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic. Shell's PR company valued the most recent two-year deal with Lego at $116 million, and reported that Shell achieved a 7.5% worldwide sales uplift during the promotion video from Iris International. Lego announced that when the latest contract between the two companies comes to an end it will not be renewing it.\n\nAs of August 2014, more than 750,000 people worldwide had signed a Greenpeace petition asking Lego to end its partnership with Shell. Lego responded saying they \"expect that Shell lives up to their responsibilities wherever they operate\" and that they \"intend to live up to the long term contract with Shell, which we entered into in 2011.\" Meanwhile, Greenpeace produced a video campaigning against the Shell partnership; it received extensive press coverage and was viewed more than six million times on YouTube. In October 2014, Lego announced that it would not be renewing its promotional contract with Royal Dutch Shell but did not say when the existing deal with Shell expires. Greenpeace claimed the decision was in response to its campaigning.\n\nIn January 2014, a handwritten letter to Lego from a seven-year-old American girl, Charlotte Benjamin, received widespread attention in the media. In it the young author complained that there were \"more Lego boy people and barely any Lego girls\" and observed that \"all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs, but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people … even swam with sharks\".\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that Lego would be launching a new \"Research Institute\" collection featuring female scientists including a female chemist, palaeontologist, and astronomer. The science-themed project was selected as the latest Lego Ideas winner, and was submitted by Ellen Kooijman, a geochemist in Stockholm. Lego denied claims that the set was introduced to placate criticism of the company by activists, pointing to its Lego Ideas origins. The Research Institute range sold out within a week of its online release in August 2014. The BBC's Tom de Castella reported that Kooijman was pleased with the set's final design, despite the addition of face make-up to her original proposal, and that Becky Francis, professor of education and social justice at King's College London, who had been \"very, very disappointed\" by Lego Friends, is a fan.\n\nThe Lego Group has built eight amusement parks around the world, each known as Legoland. Each park features large-scale Lego models of famous landmarks and miniature Lego models of famous cities, along with Lego themed rides. The first Legoland park was built in Lego's home town of Billund in Denmark. This was followed by Legoland Windsor in England, Legoland California in Carlsbad, US and Legoland Deutschland in Günzburg, Germany. In addition, Legoland Sierksdorf was opened in 1973, but soon closed in 1976.\n\nIn July 2005, the Lego Group announced that it had reached a deal with private investment company the Blackstone Group to sell all four parks for €375m to the Blackstone subsidiary Merlin Entertainments. Under the terms of the deal, The Lego Group would take a 30% share in Merlin Entertainments and positions on their board. The sale of the theme parks was part of a wider strategy to restructure the company to focus on the core business of toy products.\n\nIn 2010, Merlin Entertainments opened the first Legoland water park at the Legoland California site. On 15 October 2011, Merlin Entertainments opened their first new Legoland park, Legoland Florida, in Winter Haven, Florida. It is the largest Legoland opened to date at 145 acres, and also only one of the Legoland parks opened in the United States. The other Legoland (opened at a later date) water park was opened near the same location on 26 May 2012 after only 4 months of construction.\n\nMerlin Entertainments opened their second new Legoland park in Nusajaya, Malaysia under the name Legoland Malaysia on 22 September 2012. It is the first Legoland in Asia and was quickly followed by another Lego-themed water park in the same area. The first Lego hotel has also opened near the site. People who stay in the hotel will also get tickets to the theme park and water park.\n\nMerlin Entertainments has also planned several new Legoland parks: Legoland Dubai, Legoland Nagoya (scheduled to open in 2015), and Legoland Korea (also scheduled to open in 2015). In addition, they have opened four new Legoland Discovery Centres, which take the Legoland concept and scale it down to suit a retail park environment.\n\nThe Lego Group operates 138 retail stores (83 in the United States, 14 in the United Kingdom, 11 in Germany, 10 in Canada, 7 in France, 2 in Spain, 2 in Austria, 2 in Italy, 2 in Serbia, 2 in Denmark, 1 in Belgium, 2 in China, 1 in Sweden, 1 in Poland, 1 in India, 1 in Lithuania and 3 in Mexico.). The Lego Group also franchised its store brand to Majid Al Futtaim Group, which opened 6 stores in 2015 (4 in the United Arab Emirates, and 2 in Kuwait).\n\nOctober 2002 saw a significant change in The Lego Group's direct retail policy with the opening of the first so-called \"Lego Brand Store\" in Cologne, Germany. The second, in Milton Keynes, UK, followed quickly – several dozen more opened worldwide over the next few years, and most of the existing stores have been remodelled on the new \"Brand Store\" template. One of the distinctive features of these new stores is the inclusion of a \"Pick-A-Brick\" system that allows customers to buy individual bricks in bulk quantities. How a customer buys Lego pieces at a Pick-A-Brick is quite simple: customers fill a large or small cup or bag with their choice of Lego bricks from a large and varied selection and purchase it. The opening of most of these stores, including the 2003 opening of one in the Birmingham Bull Ring shopping centre in England, have been marked by the production of a new, special, limited edition, commemorative Lego DUPLO piece. Lego opened the first brand store in its home country Denmark in Copenhagen on 13 December 2010. There are 2 stores in Austria, 1 store in Belgium, 12 stores in Germany, 13 stores in the United Kingdom, 6 stores in France, 5 stores in Spain, 2 stores are opened in Belgrade Serbia, 1 store in Sweden, 1 store in Denmark, and 1 store in Lithuania for a total of 41 stores in Europe. In 2016, 2 stores have been opened in Milan (Italy) and another in Verona (Italy)\n\nIn 1992, when the Mall of America opened in Bloomington, Minnesota, one of its premier attractions was the Lego Imagination Center (LIC). An imagination centre is a large Lego store with displays of Lego sculptures and a play area with bins of bricks to build with. The store inventory includes a large selection of Lego sets for sale, including sets which are advertised in Lego catalogues as \"Not Available in Any Store.\" A second imagination centre opened at the Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. Between 1999 and 2005, Lego opened 24 further stores in North America in 23 states. As of 2016, there are 90 Lego stores operating or soon-to-be operating in North America in 32 US states and five Canadian provinces. These stores sell various Lego merchandise, including minifigures, Pick-a-Brick, and custom packaged minifigures.\n\nThe first Lego store in India was opened in Chennai, Tamil Nadu in March 2014 by Funskool, under licence from the Lego Group.\n\nLego Interactive (formerly Lego Media and later Lego Software) was the video game publishing division of The Lego Group. The company was founded as Lego Media in 1996 and headquartered in London, England. In February 1999, Lego Media announced their move into the girls' software industry, starting with \"Lego Friends\". Eventually, The Lego Group opted out of the video game business and Lego Interactive was shut down. Former Lego Interactive staff opened Giant Interactive Entertainment, which later became part of TT Games.\n\nLego Media also operated a motion picture division, which produced the BBC children's series \"Little Robots\" for Cosgrove Hall Films. In 2003, this division was rebranded to Create TV and Film Limited, and became independent from The Lego Group under Lego's majority owner Kirkbi A/S, which allowed Create TV and Film to branch onto other projects. The company later produced \"\", \"\" and \"\" for Creative Capers Entertainment. In 2005, Kirkbi A/S sold Create TV and Film to its chief executive officer, Vanessa Chapman, and the company was renamed Create Media Ventures Limited. The sale included \"Little Robots\" but excluded the Bionicle movies, which were retained by The Lego Group.\n\nIn 2003, The Lego Group faced a budget deficit of 1.4 billion DKK (US$220 million at then current exchange rates; equal to EUR 175 million), causing Poul Plougmann to be replaced by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen as president. In the following year, almost one thousand employees were laid off, due to budget cuts. However, in October 2004, on reporting an even larger deficit, Kristiansen also stepped down as president, while placing DKK800 million of his private funds into the company.\n\nIn 2005, The Lego Group reported a 2004 net loss of DKK1,931 million on a total turnover, including Legoland amusement parks, of DKK7,934 million.\n\nFor 2005, the company returned a profit of DKK702 million, having increased its revenue by 12% to DKK7,050 million in 2005 against DKK6,315 million in 2004. It also cut expenditures and disposed of amusement parks and a factory in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2011, sales for the company grew 11%, rising from $2.847 billion in 2010 to $3.495 billion in 2011. Profit for 2011 fiscal year increased from $661 million to $776 million. The increased profit was due to the enormous popularity of the new brand Ninjago, which became the company's biggest product introduction ever.\n\nIn 2012, it was reported that The Lego Group had become the world's most valuable toy company ahead of Mattel with a value at over $14.6 billion.\n\nThe Lego Group delivered a turnover of DKK14,142m in the first half of 2015 with an increase of 18% compared with the same period in 2014 measured in local currency (i.e. excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes). Net profit for the first half of 2015 was DKK3,553m compared with DKK2,715m for the first half of 2014. First half-year sales were driven by double-digit growth across all geographical regions and strong product innovation on themes such as Lego Ninjago, Lego Elves and Lego Creator.\n\nThe Lego Group announced on 4 September 2017 its intention to cut 1,400 jobs following reduced revenue and profit in the first half of the year, the first reported decrease in 13 years. The revenue losses are due to a more competitive environment, where the company has to compete not only against its traditional competitors Mattel and Hasbro, but also against technology companies such as Sony or Microsoft as more children use mobile devices for entertainment. The job cuts account for 8 percent of the company's total work force.\nOn May 2018, the company made it to Forbes top 100 World's Most Valuable Brands 2018, being 97th on the list.\n"}
{"id": "2159251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159251", "title": "Zhou Dunyi", "text": "Zhou Dunyi\n\nZhou Dunyi (; 1017–1073) was a Chinese philosopher, cosmologist, and writer during the Song Dynasty. He conceptualized the Neo-Confucian cosmology of the day, explaining the relationship between human conduct and universal forces. In this way, he emphasizes that humans can master their \"qi\" (\"vital life energy\") in order to accord with nature. He was a major influence to Zhu Xi, who was the architect of Neo-Confucianism. Zhou Dunyi was mainly concerned with Taiji (supreme polarity) and Wuji (limitless potential), the yin and yang, and the wu xing (the five phases). He is also venerated and credited in Taoism as the first philosopher to popularize the concept of the taijitu or \"yin-yang symbol\".\n\nBorn in 1017 in Yingdao County, Daozhou prefecture, in present-day Yongzhou, southern Hunan, Zhou was originally named Zhou Dunshi. Raised by a scholar-official family, he was changed his name in 1063 to avoid a character in the personal name of the new Emperor Yingzong.\n\nHis father died when he was fourteen and he was taken in by his uncle Zheng Xiang. He received his first posting in government through his uncle. Although very active in his civil service career, he never did achieve a high position or get the \"Presented Scholar\" degree (\"jinshi\"). Some of the positions that he held were district record keeper (1040), magistrate in various districts (1046–1054), prefectural staff supervisor, and professor of the directorate of education and assistant prefect (1061–1064). He resigned from his last post one year before he died. He died near Mount Lu in Jiangxi province in 1073. After his death, Zhou was commonly called Zhou Lianxi for a name he adopted in his retirement that honored the Lian stream near his home. He was nicknamed the \"Poor Zen Fellow\" by Cheng Yi and posthumously honored as the \"Duke of Yuan\" (\"Yuangong\") in 1200.\n\nZhou Dunyi's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (五经博士; 五經博士; Wǔjīng Bóshì).\n\nIn 1452 the title of 'Wujing Boshi' was bestowed upon Meng Xiwen 孟希文, the 56th generation offspring of Mengzi and upon Yan Xihui 顔希惠, the 59th generation offspring of Yan Hui; in 1456-1457 the same was bestowed on Zhou Mian 週冕, the 12th generation offspring of Zhou Dunyi, on Chen Keren 程克仁, the 17th generation offspring of the Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi), and on Zhu Ting 朱梴 (Zhu Chan?), the 9th generation offspring of Zhu Xi; in 1539 the same was awarded to Zeng Zhicui 曾質粹, the 60th generation offspring of Zeng Can; in 1622 an offspring of Zhang Zai received the title and in 1630 an offspring of Shao Yong.\n\nThe \"Taiji Tushuo\" (, \"Explanations of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\" or \"Diagram Explaining the Supreme Ultimate\") was placed at the head of the neo-Confucian anthology \"Jinsilu\" (\"Reflections on Things at Hand\") by Zhu Xi and Lü Zuqian in 1175. He fused Confucian ethics and concepts from the Book of Changes (\"I Ching\") with Daoist naturalism. He developed a metaphysics based on the idea that \"the many are ultimately one and the one is ultimate.\" This was the first 11th-century Chinese text to argue for the inseparability of metaphysics or cosmology and ethics, as well as the first major Chinese text to explore the concept of the taijitu or \"yin-yang symbol\".\n\nIt contained his theory of creation, which can be summarized in the following paraphrase of its first section:\n\"In the beginning, there was t'ai chi (taiji) (the great ultimate of being), which was fundamentally identical with wu chi (wuji) (the ultimate of non-being). Because of the abundance of energy within t'ai chi, it began to move and thus produced the yang (the positive cosmic force). When the activity of the yang reached its limit, it reverted to tranquility. Through tranquility the yin (the negative cosmic force) was generated. When tranquility reached its limit, it returned to movement (yang). Thus yin and yang generated each other. Then, through the union of the yin and the yang the transformation of both, the five agents (or elements) of metal, wood, water, fire and earth were brought into being. These five agents are conceived of as material principles rather than as concrete things. They can therefore be considered the common basis of all things. The interaction of the yin and yang through different combinations of the five agents generates all things in a process of endless transformation.\"\nZhou Dunyi postulated that human beings receive all these qualities and forces in their higher excellence and, hence, are the most intelligent of all creatures. He also believed that the five agents corresponded directly to the five moral principles of \"ren\" (humanity), \"yi\" (righteousness), \"li\" (propriety), \"zhi\" (wisdom), and \"xin\" (faithfulness).\n\nThe \"Tong Shu\" (\"The All-Embracing Book\" or \"Penetrating the 'Book of Changes<nowiki>'</nowiki>\") was a reinterpretation of the Confucian doctrines. It was the basis for ethics in neo-Confucianism. It stated that the sage is a superior man who acts in accordance with the principles of propriety, humanity, righteousness, wisdom, faithfulness, tranquility and sincerity. Sincerity being the basis for moral nature, it can be used to distinguish between good and evil and to perfect oneself.\n\nIt spoke of principle, nature, and destiny together, which became three cardinal concepts of Confucian thought. He had a Daoist perspective toward nature. There are stories of Zhou Dunyi loving his grass so much that he would not cut it, reinforcing the concept that humans should appreciate life in nature and the importance of non-action. Zhou Dunyi is known to have said that the best quality of life is that of a pure lotus growing out of dirty waters, where the lotus is the natural equivalent of the noble person. He is known for pulling many ideas from Daoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.\n\nZhou Dunyi had only two students who made any major contribution to Confucianism: his nephews Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao. The Cheng brothers studied under Zhou Dunyi only for a short time when they were younger. The brothers moved on to establish the Cheng-Zhu School, which dominated Chinese philosophy for over 700 years. Zhou Dunyi is considered the founding father of that school although there are no references in the Cheng brothers' writings to his contributions.\n\nZhou Dunyi was a major influence on Zhu Xi, who was considered one of the greatest Confucian thinkers since Confucius himself. Zhu Xi was known to have said that Zhou Dunyi was the first great sage of the Song Dynasty, particularly for his emphasis on the concept of Wuji.\n\nThough he never had much influence during his lifetime, he was remembered as warm, humane, and kin with the natural world. Many Confucians believed that he embodied the virtue of \"authenticity\". He had great insight into the Way of Heaven. The first major popularization of the taijitu symbol is also credited to Zhou Dunyi; this symbol (in an altered form) is now known worldwide as the commonly accepted symbol for the Chinese concepts of yin and yang.\n\n\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at San Diego State.\n\nMcCoy has also played for the New Orleans Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks.\n\nMcCoy attended Tustin High School in Tustin, California. He set the school record for quarterback sacks with 18.5 sacks as a junior. As a senior, he broke his own record with 23 sacks and was named \"High School Defensive Player of the Year\" by the Orange County Register.\n\nMcCoy played college football at San Diego State University where he won All-Mountain West Conference honors. He finished his career with eight sacks, 270 tackles (26.5 for losses), four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, four pass deflections, and a blocked kick.\n\nMcCoy was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft as a project linebacker whom Eagles personnel felt they could develop. McCoy was expected to contribute to special teams, but did not contribute in his rookie season. Going into 2006, he was named the weakside linebacker starter by Defensive Coordinator Jim Johnson. Initially he had been praised as having great speed, sideline to sideline pursuit abilities and a high motor, as well as described as a \"ball hawk\". He had an injured shoulder later in the year that prevented him from playing as well as he had during the first 6 weeks of the season, and ultimately led to his benching in favor of rookie Omar Gaither.Matt McCoy finished the season with 66 tackles, 2 sacks, 3 forces fumbles, and 5 tackles for loss.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2007 season, McCoy was listed as a back-up linebacker and a starter on special team kickoffs. In the team's Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, McCoy was flagged for unnecessary roughness after a late hit on punter Chris Kluwe. The following day, he was cut in favor of practice squad linebacker Akeem Jordan. When asked about the penalty's effect on the transaction, head coach Andy Reid said Jordan was more the reason for the move.\n\nAfter being let go by the Eagles, McCoy was signed by the New Orleans Saints on November 3, 2007. He appeared in four games with the team, recording two solo tackles.\n\nMcCoy was not tendered a contract by the team as a restricted free agent the following off-season, making him an unrestricted free agent.\n\nOn March 4, 2008, McCoy signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nAfter being inactive for the 2009 regular season opener, McCoy recorded one tackle against the Buffalo Bills on September 20. He was released by the Buccaneers on September 26 when wide receiver Mario Urrutia was promoted from the practice squad. He was re-signed on September 29, when Urrutia was waived. McCoy was released again on October 13, to make room for newly signed wide receiver Yamon Figurs. He was re-signed on November 11.\n\nOn March 16, 2010, McCoy signed with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n"}

He was the son of Knut Johan Johannesen (1900–1979) and Ingeborg Malene Olsdatter Skaalevik (1902–1981).\nJohannesen graduated artium at Bergen Cathedral School in 1949.\nHe studied history, English and Norwegian at University of Oslo and took his master's degree in Literature History in 1960. He wrote his dissertation \"Vårmotivet hos Olaf Bull\" on the poetry of Olaf Bull (1883-1933).\n\nFrom 1960-63, he was a high school lecturer and 1964-69 a freelance author and writer. In 1969 he joined the University of Bergen as assistant teacher at the Nordic Institute. He was a senior lecturer in Scandinavian literature from 1977, associate professor in 1981-86 and in 1996 he was appointed professor in rhetoric. \nHe drowned during 2005 while on vacation in Egypt.\n\nGeorg Johannesen's entered the literary scene with a novel, \"Høst i mars\" ( (1957), a tender love story with a tragic denouement about romance in the face of bourgeois prejudice. The novel was followed by three collections of poetry. The first of these, \"Dikt 1959\" (1959), deals with temporal subjects. The second collection, \"Ars moriendi\" (1965), is structured around a rigid formal arrangement inspired by the Seven deadly sins of Christianity. The last, \" Nye dikt\" (1966) is more politically-driven.\n\nJohannesen stirred controversy in 1967 with his play \"Kassandra\". The play was attacked for its blasphemous content and caused an uproar when it was first performed at the Det Norske Teatret. The play shows Johannesen's genius of creating a socially critical work.\n\nJohannesen's love for paradox and delivering political messages in his work continued in \"Tredje kongebok\" (1978), \" Johannes' bok\" (1978) and \"Simons bok\" (1980). These works were laden with paradox and irony, literary devices Johannesen often worked with. These works were allegorical, shedding light on some of contemporary Norway's problems. The Norwegian drive for oil was presented in a satirical manner in the novel \"Mongstad\" (1989), which Johannesen published under the pseudonym Kathy Johns.\n\nAll his writing shows an interest in the power that language has to enshroud true meaning. Johannesen's most important task was to unveil language. His essays show a certain fondness for paradox. Both his plays and his poems bear evidence of inspiration from the work of German dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956).\n"}

He was drafted by the Giants in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft and later won two Super Bowls with the team, both over the New England Patriots. He played college football at Louisiana State University.\n\nWebster attended St. James High School in Vacherie, Louisiana and was a two sport star in both football and basketball. He was an all state quarterback wearing jersey #1 for the Wildcats football team and an all state guard wearing jersey #11 for the basketball team. He was recruited as a wide receiver coming out of high school but was later asked to play cornerback at LSU by then coach Nick Saban.\n\nAfter catching 7 passes for 74 yards as a true freshman, Webster converted to Cornerback for the 2002 season. He would end his college career with 16 interceptions (2nd in school history), be named as a 1st Team All-American twice, and was a 1st Team All-SEC selection 3 times. As a Junior in 2003, he finished 2nd in the SEC with 25 pass breakups and had 17 as a Sophomore in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, Webster was limited to special teams duty or even inactive after starting the first few weeks after what was seen as a widely poor performance in the Giants opening weeks of the season. Later on in the season, he had a good game against the Buffalo Bills in week 16, which was a precursor to his playoff success. He had an interception and a touchdown against the Bills. In the Wild Card Playoff game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he intercepted Jeff Garcia in the end zone. He also recovered a fumble by Buccaneers returner Micheal Spurlock at the beginning of the second half. This turnover set up a Giant field goal. In the , he came up with near shutdown defense on All-Pro Terrell Owens. He also made what turned out to be the game-winning interception against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game, sending the Giants to Super Bowl XLII. This turned out to be Brett Favre's last pass as a Packer.\n\nIn Super Bowl XLII, Webster provided a huge performance through the first three quarters. However, on the go-ahead Patriots scoring drive, he fell down, which allowed New England Patriots receiver Randy Moss to score an easy touchdown on a key third down play, putting the Patriots up 14-10 with less than three minutes to go in the game. But, he came back to deflect a pass from Tom Brady to Randy Moss on the next drive to prevent the Patriots from scoring, and all but securing the Super Bowl victory.\n\nOn December 14, 2008, the New York Giants gave him a 5-year $43.5 million deal with $20 million guaranteed.\n\nDuring the Giants opening home game against the Redskins on September 13, 2009, Webster was involved in an altercation with Washington Redskins wide receiver Santana Moss. Both players were penalized for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.\n\nWebster had a career-high six interceptions during the 2011 regular season.

{"id": "2159283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159283", "title": "Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series", "text": "Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series\n\n\"Final Fantasy VII\", a role-playing video game developed by Square (now Square Enix) and originally released in 1997, features many fictional characters in both major and minor roles. \"VII\" has been followed by multiple sequels and prequels, grouped into the multimedia series \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\": these include the 2004 mobile game \"\", the 2005 movie sequel \"\", the 2006 shooter spinoff \"\", and the 2007 action game \"\". Other media include spin-off books and the original video animation \"\". The setting of \"Final Fantasy VII\" is a world that has been described as an industrial or post-industrial science fiction setting. It is referred to as \"the Planet\" in most of the games, and was retroactively named \"Gaia\" in some Square Enix promotional material.\n\n\"VII\" follows Cloud Strife, a troubled mercenary who joins with an eco-terrorist group to stop Shinra from draining the life of the Planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, conflicts escalate and the world's safety becomes their central concern as new forces emerge to challenge the original group. Cloud and his team eventually face off against the game's antagonist, Sephiroth. Other important characters in the series include Aerith Gainsborough, a flower seller who becomes a good friend to Cloud; Zack Fair, Cloud's friend, a former soldier of Shinra and the protagonist of \"Crisis Core\"; and Vincent Valentine, a man made immortal by Shinra experimentation and the protagonist of \"Dirge of Cerberus\". The conflict between Cloud and Sephiroth forms the core narrative around which many of the series' stories are built. Other characters include the Turks, a covert group which originally worked for Shinra.\n\nThe original characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura, who had done monster designs for \"Final Fantasy VI\" and was chosen for the role after his designs impressed producer Hironobu Sakaguchi. Nomura was responsible for many of the characters and their stories. The scenario for the original game was written by Sakaguchi, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima. Nomura, Kitase and Nojima have been involved in other titles in the \"Compilation\". The characters of \"VII\" have met with positive reception in contemporary and modern reviews, while their portrayal in the \"Compilation\" titles has been mixed: while \"Crisis Core\" was generally praised, the focus on secondary characters in \"Dirge of Cerberus\" drew mixed opinions from some, while their appearance in \"Advent Children\" was generally cited as confusing or poor for newcomers to the series. The entire cast, along with multiple side characters and villains, have remained popular among critics and series fans over the years, with many lists and opinion polls citing them as some of the best characters in the \"Final Fantasy\" series.\n\nThe original concept for \"Final Fantasy VII\"s world was for a fully modern setting, but after the project moved from the 2D Super Nintendo Entertainment System to development for the PlayStation console, the setting altered with it. Elements from the original concept were later used in \"Final Fantasy VIII\" and \"Parasite Eve\". The game's producer, Hironobu Sakaguchi, chose character designer Tetsuya Nomura to create the main cast. Nomura had previously worked on monster designs for \"Final Fantasy VI\". Sakaguchi chose Nomura after being amused by the way Nomura did the storyboarding for the cutscenes. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated that when he was brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he \"went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [he'd] done the hero and heroine, [he] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [he] handed over the designs [he'd] tell people the character details [he'd] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper.\" Nomura also created Zack Fair, who was a late addition to the cast meant to add depth to Cloud and Aerith's relationship, and came up with the name for Red XIII, wanting an \"interesting\" name that combined a color and a number. Although the game was Nomura's favorite \"Final Fantasy\" project, he felt that it was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his \"true\" style.\n\nThe game's plot was created by Sakaguchi, although the majority of scenario writing was done by Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima, who conceived of the Shinra plot thread, Cloud and Sephiroth's relationship and Cloud's backstory. The Lifestream, the source of life for the planet, was one of the earliest concepts created for \"VII\", but its depiction and purpose changed drastically during development. The concepts behind the Lifestream and Aerith's iconic death scene were sparked in Sakaguchi by the death of his mother, which inspired a wish to create a realistic death for Aerith rather than a \"Hollywood\" sacrificial death. The \"dark\" theme described by Nomura is continued throughout the \"Compilation\", with characters such as Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo in \"\" and the Tsviets in \"\". Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that voice acting was one of the topics to which the \"Compilation\" team paid close attention. As Cloud and Vincent have similar personalities, care was taken to differentiate between them and their dialogue. The compilation was originally conceived as only one title (\"Advent Children\"), which focused on Tifa and Cloud, but they eventually expanded it into a collection which included other games focusing on other characters, such as Zack and Vincent. Nomura himself requested Hajime Tabata, the director of \"\", to create a game focusing on the Turks.\n\n is the protagonist of \"Final Fantasy VII\", \"Final Fantasy VII:Advent Children\", \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\", and a recurring character through the \"Compilation\". In \"Final Fantasy VII\", he is a mercenary employed by the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. He claims to be a former member of SOLDIER, until a traumatic experience helps him discover lost memories of his true self. Cloud is voiced in English by Steve Burton in most media, and Cody Christian in \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\". His Japanese voice actor is Takahiro Sakurai.\n\n, birth name , is a powerful, intelligent member of an unnamed canine species with the ability to speak. In \"Final Fantasy VII\", he temporarily joins Cloud's team after they rescue him from Hojo at the Shinra building. Red XIII believed that his father, Seto, was a coward who abandoned their home, Cosmo Canyon, during a war with the Gi Tribe. Upon returning to Cosmo Canyon, however, his adoptive grandfather, Bugenhagen, brings Red XIII to the petrified body of Seto and reveals that he had sacrificed his life to save the village and single-handedly fought the entire invading army. Learning the truth, Red XIII becomes inspired and gains the courage to permanently join Cloud's group. Red XIII makes additional appearances throughout the \"Compilation\". In \"Before Crisis\", he defends a female of his species named Deneh and is subsequently captured by the Turks. In the \"On the Way to a Smile\" novella \"Case of Nanaki\", Red XIII struggles with the knowledge that he will outlive his friends. He also appears briefly in \"Advent Children\" and \"Dirge of Cerberus\"; in the former, he aids in the fight against the rogue summoned monster Bahamut SIN, and in the latter he is briefly glimpsed resting with Shelke during the ending. In \"Final Fantasy VII Lateral Biography Turks -The Kids Are Alright-\", he saves a young girl from drowning, and briefly encounters Turk member Tseng.\n\nRed XIII was the fourth character to be created by Nomura, who wanted a four-legged playable character in the cast despite inevitable graphical difficulties. He was originally conceived as a member of SOLDIER. His standard name, \"Red XIII\", was thought up by Nomura during the concept stage because he wanted something that didn't sound like a normal name. The final name came from combining the character's hair color with the number 13, an unlucky number. His real name, Nanaki, was chosen by other staff members. Nomura gave Red XIII tattoos and a general Native American motif. The character's tail having a flame at its tip was made to add more color. The name Nanaki was chosen due to its Native American sound, which linked with Red XIII's theme and backstory. Red XIII's limited appearance in \"Advent Children\" was due to difficulties with accurately animating the character's hair in a realistic manner. For his action scenes, four separate CGI layers had to be created and overlapped. In English he is voiced by Liam O'Brien in \"Advent Children\" and Max Mittelman in \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\". In Japanese he is voiced by Masachika Ichimura in \"Advent Children\", and Kappei Yamaguchi in \"Remake\".\n\nThe are a group of covert operatives who work for Shinra through many of the events of \"VII\", and later become an independent force. Officially, while part of Shinra, they were known as the Investigation Sector of the General Affairs Department. In \"Final Fantasy VII\", several Turks serve as recurring antagonists, although they are not above forming temporary alliances with the game's group of central characters. They are also the playable characters and protagonists of the \"Final Fantasy VII\" prequel, \"Before Crisis\", which focuses exclusively on their actions in the years leading up to the events of the original game. The player chooses from eleven unnamed Turks, each with his or her own backstory, personality, strengths and weaknesses. With one exception, each Turk is identified based on their weapon and sex. Among important Turks in the series are:\n\n is the main antagonist of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Advent Children\". Originally a member of Shinra's SOLDIER elite, a traumatic incident involving his true origins drove him insane. This prompts him to abandon his humanity and attempt to attain godhood by absorbing the Lifestream, the source of life on the planet. He manipulates and tortures Cloud over the course of \"Final Fantasy VII\", and kills Aerith at the Forgotten City. Cloud ultimately destroys him at the end of the game, but he returns in \"Advent Children\", where he is reborn and subsequently defeated again by Cloud. Sephiroth also appears in nearly every title in the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\". The character is voiced in English by Lance Bass in the first Kingdom Hearts, George Newbern in most media, and Tyler Hoechlin in \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\". In Japanese he is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in most appearances, and Shin-ichiro Miki in \"Ehrgeiz\".\n\n is an extraterrestrial lifeform who crash-landed on the planet two thousand years prior to the events of \"VII\", portrayed in multiple titles in the \"Compilation\" as a female humanoid. When Jenova originally crashed, she began infecting the Cetra with a virus, to the point that they were almost wiped out. However, a small group managed to seal Jenova in a tomb, which was later excavated by Shinra. Jenova was mistaken for a Cetra, and samples from her remains were used in the experiments that created SOLDIER and Sephiroth. Sephiroth and Jenova's goal in both \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"Advent Children\" is to take control of the planet and use it to roam through space until they find another world to build on. In \"Advent Children\", Jenova's last remains are acquired by Rufus, whilst the Remnants hope to find and use them to resurrect Sephiroth. Jenova is also responsible for the disease Geostigma, which infects all those who came into contact with the tainted Lifestream after Sephiroth was defeated.\n\nJenova's original forms during \"VII\"s development were very different from her final incarnation; the original Jenova was a hostile region of the brain that would awake in people possessing certain genes. The name \"Jenova\" was to have been inherited by a book written by the Cetra on the subject. While Jenova's remains in \"Advent Children\" are called a \"head\", this is not technically accurate. The term was only used because developers couldn't think of a more suitable name. One of the ideas discussed for Sephiroth's resurrection was for the remnant to eat Jenova's remains. The disease caused by Jenova's presence in the Lifestream, Geostigma, was based on a discarded concept for \"Final Fantasy X\".\n\nLike Sephiroth, whose name comes from a Jewish mystical tradition called the Kabbalah, Jenova comes from a portmanteau of the Jewish god name Jehova and the Latin word Nova, meaning new. Jenova is the \"new god\" that disrupted the Cetra's existing order.\n\nHe appears in \"Advent Children\" in possession of Jenova's remains, and claims that he intends to repair the damage Shinra had caused to Gaia. In \"Advent Children\", Rufus uses a wheelchair and covers himself with a white sheet, and although these are later shown to be a facade while he was holding Jenova's remains. While not seen in \"Dirge of Cerberus\" except in a flashback, it is hinted that he is secretly funding the WRO (World Regenesis Organization). Rufus is voiced by Wally Wingert in Advent Children and Josh Bowman in Final Fantasy VII Remake in English. He is voiced by Tōru Ōkawa in Japanese.\n\n, and are the antagonists of \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\". Known as \"Remnants\", they are manifestations of Sephiroth's will, driven to find samples of their \"mother\" Jenova to trigger Sephiroth's resurrection and get vengeance upon the world. The three frequently come into conflict with the remains of Shinra and Cloud. Eventually, Kadaj is successful in merging with Jenova's cells, triggering Sephiroth's resurrection. Kadaj, like Sephiroth, is mortally wounded by Cloud and dies in his arms, while Loz and Yazoo die in a final attack on Cloud.\n\nThe remnants were created to represent different aspects of Sephiroth's personality: Kadaj represented his cruelty, Loz represented his strength, and Yazoo represented his allure. To fit in with the film's theme of the \"next generation\", they were all made younger than Cloud and Sephiroth. Kadaj's original moniker during production was \"Lost Name\". Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo are respectively voiced by Steven Staley/Shotaro Morikubo, Fred Tatasciore/Kenji Nomura and Dave Wittenberg/Yuji Kishi.\n\n is a military force created by Shinra which acts as the antagonist of \"Dirge of Cerberus\", created by the company using genetic engineering to be a covert force. The leaders of Deepground are the Tsviets, an elite who were infused with genetic material belonging to Genesis Rhapsodos. The Tsviets' original leaders, the Restrictors, were overthrown when the Tsviets used one of their own who had yet to be fully indoctrinated to kill the Restrictor leader. During the events of \"Dirge of Cerberus\", they are manipulated by Hojo possessing their leader into attempting to awaken OMEGA, a means for the Lifestream to escape the planet during times of catastrophe. Although one of the members, Shelke, is rescued from the group, the others are killed, although Weiss' body is rescued by Genesis and transported somewhere. The Tsviets are:\n\n is a character first seen in \"Dirge of Cerberus\" who acts as the antagonist of \"Crisis Core\". Genesis was a product of the same program that created Sephiroth, but Genesis was not as stable as Sephiroth and began suffering from a degenerative process called \"degradation\" after being wounded during a sparring match with Sephiroth and Angeal. Allying with a rogue Shinra scientist named Hollander, Genesis fights against the company while seeking a way to stop his degradation using Sephiroth's stable cells. Eventually, Genesis is first defeated by Zack, then cured of his degradation by the Lifestream. Genesis was taken in by Deepground, who gave him the codename \"G\", and used him to create the Tsviets. Refusing to follow along with the Tsviets' plans after their rebellion, he seals himself in a cave until he is needed. During the secret ending of \"Dirge of Cerberus\", Genesis awakes, determined to protect and defend the planet.\n\nGenesis was modeled on the character's Japanese voice actor Gackt, who also composed and performed the theme songs (see \"Redemption\") for \"Dirge of Cerberus\". While originally intended as a minor character cameo, Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of \"Crisis Core\", found such a passing use of a character to be a waste and asked Gackt whether he was interested in further involvement. Gackt was eager to continue with the character, ending up being one of the key creative minds behind Genesis' manners and personality. Genesis' outfit became one of Gackt's commonly worn outfits during concerts. Genesis is voiced in English by Robin Atkin Downes in \"Dirge of Cerberus\" and Oliver Quinn in \"Crisis Core\".\n\n is an important eco-terrorist organization in the world of \"Final Fantasy VII\". It is introduced as the main rebel force against Shinra, openly opposed to the company's Mako-based energy production, which is draining the planet of life. Two versions of the organization existed: the first acted as the antagonists of \"Before Crisis\", while the second featured many of the protagonists of \"VII\". While the first version of the movement was indirectly destroyed by the actions of their leader, Shinra eventually crush the movement completely, going to the lengths of destroying the sector seven of Midgar. Among its notable members were:\n\n is the former head of Shinra's \"Department of Urban Development\", and is controller of the robotic cat Cait Sith. In \"Final Fantasy VII\", Reeve originally worked against AVALANCHE, until later deciding to help them in their quest against Sephiroth: feeling repentant about his role, he aids the group through Cait Sith. He is temporarily arrested after Rufus' apparent death, but is released in time to organize an evacuation of Midgar's population before the arrival of Meteor. He also brings the news of Aerith's death to Elmyra Gainsborough, the adoptive mother of Aerith. Reeve plays a minor role in \"Before Crisis\", as the architect responsible for designing Mako reactors and aiding the Turks with the use of Cait Sith. He is not seen in \"Advent Children\", but is heard leaving a message on Cloud's cell phone. He plays a significant role in \"Dirge of Cerberus\", where he has established the World Regenesis Organization, which is dedicated to restoring the Planet. He also appears in the \"On the Way to a Smile\" novella \"Case of Denzel\" and its OVA adaptation \"On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel\". He is voiced by Jamieson Price in every major appearance and by Jon Root in \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\" in English and by Banjō Ginga in Japanese.\n\n is the young daughter of Barret's friends, Dyne and Eleanor, and the adopted daughter of Barret. Eleanor was killed by an attack from Shinra prior to the events of \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Dyne assumes Marlene to be dead as well. In actuality, Barret adopts her, thinking Dyne is dead. Barret later encounters Dyne, who has gone insane. After fighting Barret, Dyne entrusts Marlene to Barret's care and commits suicide. For most of \"Final Fantasy VII\", Marlene is left in the care of Elmyra, Aerith's adopted mother. During \"Advent Children\", she lives with Cloud, Tifa, and Denzel, while Barret is searching for a new power source for the Planet. She is instrumental in making Cloud return to his friends and continue fighting against Sephiroth's Remnants. Marlene is voiced by Grace Rolek in English and Miyū Tsuzurahara in Japanese. In \"Advent Children Complete\", she is voiced by Ariel Winter in English and by Sumire Morohoshi in Japanese. In \"Final Fantasy VII Remake\" she is voiced by Brielle Milla in English\n\n is a minor character in \"Before Crisis\" and a supporting character in \"Dirge of Cerberus\". When her sister Shelke was taken by Shinra for their Deepground unit, Shalua went in search of Shelke, joining AVALANCHE in the hope that they would lead her to her sister. During her time there, she received grave injuries resulting in the loss of her right eye and arm, and massive internal damage. This incident prompted her to leave AVALANCHE for good. In \"Dirge of Cerberus\", she is part of the World Regenesis Organization, and is responsible for saving Vincent after he is overcome by the power of Chaos. She is eventually plunged into a coma while she is helping Vincent and Shelke escape and her life support mechanism, her artificial arm, is destroyed. Her ultimate fate is not specified. Shalua is voiced by Kim Mai Guest in English and Yuu Asakawa in Japanese.\n\n is a SOLDIER 1st Class who is Zack Fair's friend and mentor, the original owner of the Buster Sword, and a close friend of Genesis and Sephiroth. Produced by the same project that birthed Genesis, when he finds out about his origins, he turns against Shinra and works with Genesis for a time. As he begins suffering from the same degradation as Genesis, he begins seeing himself as a monster and leaves Genesis, temporarily allying with Zack. Zack is eventually forced to fight and kill him. Angeal lives on for a while through Lazard Deusericus, the former director of SOLDIER who is made a copy of Angeal, and an animal-like copy. Both eventually die after protecting Cloud from a Shinra attack in Banora. Angeal is voiced by Josh Gilman in English and Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese.\n\n is a Shinra scientist first introduced in \"VII\" who acts as an important character in \"Dirge of Cerberus\". A scientist working in Nibelheim under Hojo, she worked on the research into Chaos, which she injected into Vincent while he was a Turk assigned to protect her, and provided the maternal DNA for Sephiroth. Ridden with guilt over her actions, she seals herself inside a crystal, essentially becoming immortal and virtually cut off from the outside world. Her memories are uploaded into Shelke, and through them and recordings left behind for him, she is able to communicate with Vincent, eventually leaving a final message that she is glad he survived.\n\nLucrecia was originally a fairly minor character in \"VII\". It was hard for the staff to recreate her for \"Dirge of Cerberus\" as they needed to rely on low-detail concept art and in-game models. To create the new model of Lucrecia, the concept team used Sephiroth's appearance as a base, deciding that the latter would have a maternal rather than paternal resemblance. Lucrecia is voiced by April Stewart in English and Rio Natsuki in Japanese.\n\n is a young boy who resides with Cloud, Tifa, and Marlene in the city of Edge. He first appears in \"Advent Children\" as a sufferer of the incurable disease Geostigma. He and many other sick children are lured to the Ancient City of the Cetra, where they are brought under Kadaj's control. Denzel regains his senses after Tifa protects him from Bahamut SIN during the final conflict. He is later healed of his Geostigma by drinking the water in Aerith's church. In \"Advent Children\", Denzel is voiced by Benjamin Bryan in English and Kyosuke Ikeda in Japanese, and \"Advent Children Complete\", he is voiced by Aaron Refvem in English and Kazumu Izawa in Japanese.\n\nThe characters of \"VII\" received near-unanimous praise from critics for their original appearance. In an article on GameSpot, it was stated that, despite the premise not being unique, it was \"Cloud's interactions with other characters, especially between him and [Sephiroth] which make the story so special\". Thierry Nguyen of \"Computer Gaming World\" found that both the story and character development were strong, saying that as the players progressed through the game, \"these characters intrigue you, and you get so attached to them that you might jump as a reaction to a shocking event on the first disc. Final Fantasy VII evokes that kind of emotional response.\" Steve Bauman of \"Computer Games Magazine\" called the characters \"funky\", saying that the characters \"worked wonders\" on some of the poorer dialogue. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the characters' \"clear motivations, desires and flaws\". RPGFan generally praised the characters, especially Cloud, Tifa and Sephiroth, and said that \"while on the surface they certainly do appear to fit certain stereotypes, a second look will reveal that they transcend these qualities and are compelling and complex personalities underneath.\"\n\nWhile the mobile game \"Before Crisis\", the first \"Compilation\" game title to be released, has received limited western commentary, writers at AnimeFringe felt that \"the chance to reverse the good and bad guy roles should be welcomed by many.\" \"Advent Children\" received mixed views from critics. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network felt that, due to the film's pace and context, viewers were not given enough time to get to know the characters. These sentiments were echoed by John Eriani of Mania Entertainment, who particularly faulted the lack of character names or explanations of the villains' motives. Chris Carle of IGN was critical of the lack of motivation for those who were not familiar with the series, but praised both the English and Japanese voice acting. Michael Beckett of RPGamer, while generally less than impressed by the overall story, said that it \"[provides] some interesting insights into a few of the less-developed characters of the game, though Cloud receives most of the attention and development as the story unfolds\".\n\nOpinions on the characters of \"Dirge of Cerberus\" were again mixed to positive. IGN's Jeremy Dunham was fairly positive, saying that the new characters \"go through quite a bit of development and even some of the old ones have a chance to shine\". He was also pleased with Vincent's portrayal and development in the title. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer felt that the focus on characters that were secondary or optional in the original was a weak point of the game, and that those not familiar with the original game would possibly feel lost. GameSpot's Greg Mueller praised the game's focus on Vincent's origins and development, despite finding the large number of new characters a little confusing. \"Crisis Core\"s characters were generally praised. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said that, despite new and familiar characters appearing, it was the further-explored characters of Zack and Sephiroth that he found himself sympathising with: \"The way their personal stories weave in and out of each other—and set the stage for the events in \"Final Fantasy VII\"—makes \"Crisis Core\" not just the finest role-playing experience available on the PSP, but also one of the best Japanese RPGs in years.\" Ryan Clements, writing for IGN, was pleased by the story's focus on Zack and his interactions with other characters rather than a grand narrative. Gerard Villorria of GameSpy was also positive, saying that exploring the relationships between old characters was \"a key element\", while finding the new characters and their backstories \"equally interesting\".\n\nIn regards to remake, \"IGN\" called its \"emotional arcs\". Despite noting his antisocial attitudes in the remake, \"IGN\" and \"GameSpot\" commented that Cloud is the character who has the most notable arc in \"Remake\", with Cody Christian's performance helping to improve his appeal. The idea that there are four characters with Sephiroth's name led \"VG247\" to note the remake still had its own mysteries that original players would not understand while the title. \"Siliconera\" described this incarnation of the antagonist as haunting, due to how he often appears within Cloud's hallucinations across the plot. Still, the site noticed that despite being a remake, the game explored different situations of the narrative similar to the films known as \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" that also retold an anime but with multiple changes. The portrayal of the supporting characters also earned positive response such as the potential Barret was given to develop him in the sequel or Aerith's traits and some ambiguous scenes involving her.\n\nThe characters of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and the \"Compilation\" have remained highly popular, often being cited as some of the best characters in both the \"Final Fantasy\" series and video games in general by both critics and fans. Reader and critic lists on gaming site IGN have all placed them high, with one reader poll in 2014 having multiple \"VII\" characters dominating a list of the top ten characters in the series as a whole. Sephiroth remains one of the most popular villains in video game history, unanimously voted number one by the staff of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" in their \"Top 10 Video Game Bosses\" list in October 2005. In late 2007, \"Dengeki PlayStation\" named Cloud Strife the best character of all time in their retrospective awards feature about the original PlayStation. Aerith placed fifth, Tifa placed eighth and three other characters placed in the top 50; Sephiroth at fourteenth, Reno at fifteenth, and Yuffie at forty-second. Cloud placed second in a \"Famitsu\" reader poll for Japan's favorite video game character. In a list of the best \"Final Fantasy\" characters made by \"Complex\", characters from \"Final Fantasy VII\" occupied seven out of the twenty places, with Sephiroth and Cloud coming third and first respectively. The character of Cloud has also influenced character design in the series, having had a profound influence on the design and portrayal of Lightning, the central protagonist of \"Final Fantasy XIII\" and its sequels.\n"}

The school later became Howardian High School and a Grammar School in 1941. Much of the school was subsequently destroyed by incendiary bombs in the Cardiff Blitz during the night of 3–4 March 1941 in World War II. The school's girls and boys relocated to newly built buildings, Lady Margaret High School for Girls (1948) and Howardian High School for Boys (1953), in Penylan.\n\nAfter the war the building at Howard Gardens was partially repaired. A new technical school was opened in September 1953 with around 200 boys. It was officially named ‘Fitzalan Technical High School’ in December 1953.\n\nThe Howard Gardens site was to be re-developed (as Cardiff School of Art & Design) and Fitzalan Technical High School acquired new premises on the present site in Lawrenny Avenue, Canton, Cardiff which were opened on Tuesday 3 March 1964. In January 1968 the school was renamed Fitzalan High School (dropping 'Technical'), becoming a comprehensive school.\n\nIt was announced in 2017 that Fitzalan High School would be one of three major secondary schools in Cardiff to be completely rebuilt and replaced as part of City of Cardiff Council's £284 million improvement plans.\n\nPupils are grouped according to their abilities with the more able pupils placed in an express set. Pupils with special educational needs receive specialist support in class to ensure that they can access the curriculum fully. The school has four Houses: Dewi, Llewellyn, Glyndwr, and Hywel. The school has a website, and issues a regular newsletter on school activities. A School Council exists for pupils to raise any issues through this forum. It has many community links and local residents and interest groups, who are allowed to use the extensive facilities. The school has an established and published policy on 'anti-bullying' for all pupils. A Parent Teacher Association (PTA) was formed in 1978 called the ‘Friends of Fitzalan‛. It supports the school, raises funds, and helps organise social events.\n\nIn 2007 the school embarked on a program to reduce its carbon footprint after an audit by the Carbon Trust. Steps taken included installing \"eco-quiet\" computers, one of which was to be powered by a demonstration wind turbine.\n\nThe school was awarded the NAACE Mark for excellence in the use of ICT in November 2005.\n\nThe school campus includes two gymnasia, a multi use dance studio, two indoor multi-use halls, two fitness suites, a sports hall, a swimming pool, four grass football and rugby pitches and an artificial cricket square. In addition daily access to the Gol Centre, comprising twelve five-a-side artificial football pitches, the Welsh International Athletics Stadium and artificial sports pitches. BTEC sport lessons take place both in the school and in Cardiff City Football Club.\n\n\nIn January 2020 a class of sixteen-year-olds, who had had the same maths teacher since they started the school in year 7, all passed their maths GCSE six months ahead of schedule and all achieved A*, the top grade. Only 13% of pupils in Wales who had sat the WJEC GCSE the previous year had achieved A or A*.

It was originally shared between the Dublin Castle administration and the Royal College of Science for Ireland. Among the offices of State located in the building are:\n\n\nThe building that was to become Government Buildings was the last major public building constructed under British rule in what is now the Republic of Ireland. The foundation stone for the building was laid by King Edward VII in 1904. It was built on the site of a row of Georgian houses that were being controversially demolished one by one as the new building was erected. The building itself was designed by Sir Aston Webb, a British architect who was later to redesign the façade of Buckingham Palace. The final completed building was opened by King George V in 1911.\n\nIt may have been intended for use by the Royal College of Science, but it soon attracted the attention of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland's Dublin Castle administration. It was chosen to be the location for the first meeting of the new Parliament of Southern Ireland, created under the \"Government of Ireland Act 1920\", in June 1921. The planned State Opening of Parliament proved a fiasco, as only four members of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and a minority of members of the Senate of Southern Ireland turned up. The Houses were adjourned \"sine die\" (although under the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 14 January 1922 \"“a meeting of members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland\"\" met to ratify the Treaty).\n\nWith the coming into existence of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Leinster House, the headquarters of the Royal Dublin Society, located next door to the Royal College of Science, became the provisional seat of the Free State's parliament, \"Oireachtas Shaorstát Éireann\". The Executive Council of the Irish Free State immediately commandeered part of the college as temporary office space. Two years later, the Free State decided to buy Leinster House outright from the RDS. Government usage of part of the Royal College of Science also became permanent.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1991, the former Royal College of Science building was divided between a number of bodies. The wing to the right of the main entrance (the north wing) was used by the Department of the President, later in 1938 renamed Department of the Taoiseach. The Attorney General, the Department of Justice and Equality and other offices also occupied that wing of the building. The south wing was occupied permanently by the Department of Finance. The centre block of the courtyard under the dome was still used by the Royal College of Science, and later when it merged with University College, Dublin, by students from the Faculty of Engineering. Over the decades, some departments moved out to purpose built offices, leaving the north wing for the Taoiseach, Government Secretariat and Attorney General.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, increasingly unhappy at the cramped office space, Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald decided to convert the entire building for government use. This policy was implemented by his successor, Charles Haughey, who had the state sell a block of Georgian houses across the road, which up to then had been in state ownership, for £17 million to fund the rebuild. A new engineering faculty was also built on University College, Dublin's Belfield campus at tens of millions of pounds.\nMuch of the original interior of the original building was gutted to facilitate the creation of a state-of-the-art new government office. Haughey finally moved into the new building in 1991. Critics of the expenditure, at a time when the Republic of Ireland was in financial difficulties, nicknamed the building the \"Chaz Mahal\". However, criticism of the redesigned building soon died away and it won major architectural awards for its design, with world leaders like British Prime Minister John Major praising it to then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds when he visited the building to meet him. The entrance hall is dominated by light streaming through Evie Hone's critically acclaimed stained glass window, \"My Four Green Fields\".\n\nThe new building included a state-of-the-art suite of offices for the Taoiseach and staff, a set of committee rooms, new offices, canteen facilities, a helicopter pad and a new press briefing room. Originally the Office of Public Works had planned a new cabinet suite of rooms also. However, the Government opted to continue to use the Council Chamber which had been the cabinet room for all Irish governments since 1922.\n\nGovernment Buildings are protected by the Garda Síochána and an armed company from the Military Police Corps.\n"}

The name is a reference to the former Forest of Arden. In the 2001 census the town had a population of 2,011, increasing to 2,074 at the 2011 census.\n\nHenley is known for its variety of historic buildings, some of which date back to medieval times, and its wide variety of preserved architectural styles. The one-mile-long (1.6 km) High Street is a conservation area.\n\nHenley-in-Arden is approximately 9 miles west of the county town of Warwick, 15 miles southeast of Birmingham, 9 miles east of Redditch and 9 miles north of Stratford upon Avon (where the road between Stratford and Henley was named Henley Street).\n\nIt is located in a valley of the River Alne, which separates Henley from the adjacent settlement of Beaudesert. Henley and Beaudesert effectively form a single entity, and share a joint parish council, although Beaudesert is a separate civil parish.\n\nThe town lies at a crossroads between the A3400 and the A4189 roads and is the starting point for the circular Arden Way path. It also lies on the Heart of England Way. Henley Sidings is a nature reserve managed by the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust.\n\nIn the 2001 census the population of the civil parish of Henley-in-Arden was 2,011. Whilst the population of its urban area which includes Beaudesert was 2,797.\n\nHenley-in-Arden is not listed in the Domesday Book and may not have existed until the 12th century. The first record of the town is in a legal instrument drawn during the reign of Henry II. It was originally a hamlet of Wootton Wawen, on Feldon Street, the original route out of the Forest of Arden.\n\nIn the 11th century, a Thurstan de Montfort constructed Beaudesert Castle, a motte and bailey castle, on the hill above Beaudesert. In 1140, the Empress Matilda granted the right to hold a market at the castle and Henley soon became a prosperous market town, conveniently located on the busy Birmingham-to-Stratford road. In 1220 in the reign of Henry III, the lord of the manor, Peter de Montfort, procured the grant of a weekly Monday market and an annual fair to last two days, for the town.\n\nThe initial prosperity came to an end however during the Second Barons' War when, in 1265, Peter de Montfort died fighting at the Battle of Evesham. The royalist forces won, and the town and castle were burnt in reprisal. The town and castle recovered however and Henley became a borough in 1296. In 1315 all of the recorded townsfolk were freemen. The King stayed at the castle for 7 days in January 1324. By 1336 the market was so prosperous that the inhabitants were able to obtain a licence from Edward III to impose a local sales tax on all goods brought to the market, for a period of three years, in order to pay for the cost of paving the streets.\nThe Lord of the Manor, Peter de Montfort 3rd Baron Montfort, as Commissioner of Array for Warwickshire sent 160 archers to the Battle of Crecy during the Hundred Years' War in 1346. By the 15th century, the lords of the manor were the Boteler family. Ralph Boteler, 1st Baron Sudeley obtained a charter from Henry VI in 1449, confirming the grant of the new weekly market, and a grant for two annual fairs.\nThe town suffered another misfortune during the English Civil War, when in 1643 Prince Rupert who was in charge of the Royalist forces, marched his soldiers through the town in 1643 on his way to Birmingham and pillaged the neighbourhood.\n\nAs a non-chartered market town, Henley's administration was based upon a manorial court. Under the lord of the manor were a high bailiff, a low bailiff, a third-borough, a constable, and pairs of ale-tasters, Chamberlains, leathersealers, brook lookers, fieldreeves, and affearors. These local borough officials were chosen annually by a meeting of former bailiffs and constables, and were members of the jury of the biannual court leet. The bailiff, accompanied by his predecessors, would formally open the annual town fair. The town hall was inherited from a medieval Guild. The records of the court leet and the court baron in Henley date from 1592 onwards. The court rolls are largely concerned with (in Dyer's words) modest problems, such as preventing the poor from migrating into the town (which burgers considered would become a burden on the rates and result in the destruction of hedges for fuel), the ringing of loose pigs, and the prevention of horses being parked in the streets. The poor were a significant problem for Henley's court leet. In the early 17th century there was a marked increase in the landless poor, squatting on commons and on wasteland in the Forest of Arden, and such people were generally regarded as violent and criminal by townsfolk. Between 1590 and 1620 there were a disproportionate number of people, relative to the size of the population, presented by the court leet for engaging in violent affray, something which Underdown states to be \"surely no coincidence\".\nIn \"Love's Labours Lost\" Rosaline says \"Better wits have worn plain Statute Caps.\". This is believed to be a reference to events in Henley during the writing of that play, before its publication, when the denizens of Henley were prosecuted in the court leet for being in breach of a statute (enacted with the aim of ensuring economic support for the wool industry) that required the wearing of woollen caps on Sundays and other holy days.\n\nBy 1814, Henley had a weekly market every Monday, three annual fairs (on Lady Day; on Tuesday in Whitsunday-week, for cattle; and on 29 October for horses, cattle, sheep, and hops), and a population in 1811 (according to returns made to Parliament) of 1,055 (with 242 inhabited houses and 12 uninhabited houses).\n\nAlthough the castle no longer remains, several other historical buildings and structures still exist in the town, such as the parish churches of St. Nicholas and St. John the Baptist, the 15th century Guildhall (which has been restored), the medieval market cross (much of the decoration of whose shaft has been mutilated but which has three ranges of kneeling places and sculptures representing the Holy Trinity, the cruxifixion of Jesus, and, it is believed, St Peter), the 16th century White Swan, and several half timbered residences along High Street, the main street of the town.\n\nHistorically, Henley has had several private lunatic asylums. The first was licensed in 1744, which housed pauper lunatics at the expense of the parish. Another was run by Thomas Burman in 1795, who charged \"one guinea/week for board and medicines, the patient finding their own linen and washing. If any person chuses a servant constantly to attend on them, board and wages are separately considered.\".\n\nHenley-in-Arden railway station is on the Birmingham to Stratford Line and has regular rail services to Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford upon Avon station. The line south of Stratford upon Avon previously connected along the Honeybourne Line to Honeybourne (which is on the Cotswold Line) and onwards to Cheltenham.\n\nThe town lies a few miles southwest of the M40 motorway, which links Birmingham and London.\n\nBus service X20 running from Birmingham to Stratford-upon-Avon runs through the town along the High Street, this service is operated by local Henley-in-Arden based bus and coach company Johnsons Coach and Bus under contract to Warwickshire County Council operating up to every 60 minutes.\n\nSchools serving the town include Henley-in-Arden Montessori Primary School, Henley-In-Arden CE Primary School, Henley-in-Arden School, River House School and St Mary's RC Primary School.\n\nThe prolific writer of hymns, Benjamin Beddome (1717–1795), was born in the town. Many of his hymns are in the \"General Baptist Hymn Book\".\n\nWilliam James (1771–1837), pioneer railway promoter, was born in Henley.\n\n\n\n"}

A colonial ancestry entitled him to membership in the Sons of the American Revolution and in the Society of Colonial Wars. He was also an hereditary member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.\n\nHis college education was secured at Northwestern (A.B. 1874, M.A. 1879) and Harvard (A.B. 1876, A.M. 1877). After studying law in an office, in 1879 he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Chicago. Although both able and prominent as an attorney (representing, for example, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in securing a right of way into Chicago, and in the erection of its terminal therein), his tastes from the beginning ran to public life, and he was soon both active and useful as a worker in the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1884 he was a member of the lower house of the state legislature, and from 1897 to 1911 a representative of Chicago districts in Congress. There he was a member of the committees on Rules, and on Ways and Means, and was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures of the Navy. He was an effective speaker and of considerable influence, but his tariff views were unacceptable to business interests in Chicago, which forced his retirement. President William Howard Taft then appointed him to the post of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal, on March 2, 1911. He never assumed its duties, and on April 24, 1911, he was given a similar appointment to Switzerland. In this post he served from May 17, 1911, to July 31, 1913.\n\nHe did not find the diplomatic service to his liking, and resigned. Before he did so he had declined the chief justiceship of the United States court of claims tendered him by President Taft (January 1913). With this his public career ended, except for service (November 1913) as chairman of a board of arbitration which settled an important dispute between the operatives and officers of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. From 1914 to 1923 he taught constitutional law and international law in Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was short of stature, very erect and dignified of carriage, alert in movement. Distinctly of the scholarly type, he was very widely read, and active, so long as he resided in Chicago, in the Literary Club of that city. His speeches, which reflected his reading, were always graceful and sometimes eloquent. In his political opinions he was fairly liberal, but in the regulation of purely personal affairs and conduct he was notably conservative. He was a rare combination of force and urbanity. Although unfailingly careful to avoid giving offense to anybody with whom he came in contact, invariably gracious, and charming in manner, his opinions were not lacking in definiteness, and he was not in any way colorless. These qualities should have won him great distinction either in law or diplomacy, but in politics they left him merely a staunch and dependable \"\"party\"\" man, whose mental independence and natural talents were hampered by party platforms. He did not win in public life the renown of which his abilities and early professional success gave promise. On December 29, 1880, he was married to Euphemia Lucia Clara Gates of Providence, Rhode Island. He died at Sanremo, Italy. Several children survived him.\n\nHe was the great nephew of William M. Evarts, great grandson of Jeremiah Evarts and the great-great grandson of Roger Sherman. His father Lewis Henry Boutell (July 21, 1826 – January 16, 1899) wrote the book, \"The Life of Roger Sherman\" (Chicago: A.C. McClurg and Co., 1896)\n\nReproduced in Biography Resource Center.

He is honorary professor at the University of Chongqing.\n\nMuch of Elster's writing is characterized by attempts to use analytical theories, especially rational choice theory, as a springboard for philosophical and ethical analysis, with numerous examples from literature and history. \"Elster has made important contributions to several fields,\" Daniel Little wrote in a review essay. \"The breadth and depth of his writings are striking in a time of high specialisation; he is read and discussed by political scientists, legal scholars, economists and philosophers. His work is difficult to summarise in a slogan, but ... it is generally informed by a broad and deep acquaintance with relevant literature in economics, political science, history, philosophy, and psychology.\"\n\nA student of the philosophy of social science (a topic he investigated through case studies in \"Explaining Technical Change\"), Elster strongly argued that social scientific explanations had to be built on top of methodological individualism (the belief that only individuals, not larger entities like \"organizations\" or \"societies\", can actually do things) and microfoundations (explaining big societal changes in terms of individual actions). He criticized Marxists and other social scientists for believing in functionalism (the belief that institutions exist because of their effect on society) and instead tried to give Marxism a foundation in game theory (the economic notion that people make choices based on the expected benefits and the choices others are likely to make).\n\nElster wrote numerous books attempting to use rational choice theory for a wide variety of social explanations. \"Rational choice theory is far more than a technical tool for explaining behaviour,\" he once wrote. \"It is also, and very importantly, a way of coming to grips with ourselves - not only what we should do, but even what we should be.\" He attempted to apply it to topics as varied as politics (\"Political Psychology\"), bias and constrained preferences (\"Sour Grapes\"), emotions (\"Alchemies of the Mind\"), self-restraint (\"Ulysses and the Sirens\", which was selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon), Marxism (\"Making Sense of Marx\"), and more.\n\nIn doing so, he elucidated many issues with simplistic notions of rational choice: endogenous preference formation (certain actions today can change preferences tomorrow, so how does one decide which preferences one prefers?), framing (people express different preferences when the same question is asked different ways), imperfect rationality (weakness of the will, emotion, impulsiveness, habit, self-deception) and our adjustments for it, and time preferences, among others.\n\nAs time went on Elster began to sour on rational choice. A 1991 review in the \"London Review of Books\" noted \"Elster has lost his bearings, or at least his faith. [His latest books], he says, 'reflects an increasing disillusion with the power of reason'.\" His magisterial 500-page book \"Explaining Social Behavior\" includes something of a recantation:\n\nThe book discusses both rational behavior, but also irrational behavior, which Elster says is \"widespread and frequent [but] not inevitable ... we \"want\" to be rational\". A more recent book, \"Le désintéressement\" (part of a two-volume \"Traité critique de l’homme économique\"), explores the ramifications of these insights for the possibility of disinterested action.\n\n\n\n"}

Designed by Flatow and Moore and completed in 1954, it was the city's first large-scale modernist building and is regarded as \"Albuquerque’s best example of the International Style\". The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1997 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, only 44 years after it was completed.\n\nAt in height, the 13-story building was the tallest in New Mexico until the Bank of New Mexico Building was completed across the street in 1961. Its design was inspired by the latest trends in modern architecture, especially the Lever House in New York City, with glass curtain walls and a combination of vertical and horizontal volumes. Sandstone blocks from the previous building on the site, the Commercial Club, were included in the exterior walls. The Simms Building also included an innovative radiant heating and cooling system with limited solar heating capabilities. The building received attention nationally as well as locally and helped catalyze the modern architecture movement in New Mexico.\n\nThe Simms Building was commissioned in 1952 by banker and former Congressman Albert G. Simms, who had owned the old Commercial Club building on the site since 1932. To design the building, he hired Max Flatow and Jason Moore, whose recently established firm Flatow and Moore would become one of the largest in New Mexico. In fact, the Simms Building was their first major project as partners. Simms initially planned to build a four- or five-story building, but when the architects showed him a more ambitious 12-story proposal he decided to go ahead with the project even though he felt it was a \"crazy idea\".\nFlatow and Moore designed a bold International style tower, reflecting the latest trends in modern architecture; the style had only recently been adapted to highrise buildings like the Lake Shore Drive Apartments (1951) and United Nations Building (1952). Their design drew particular inspiration from the Lever House in New York City, especially the glass curtain walls and the way the tower seemed to float above its horizontal base. While embracing a futuristic design, the architects also chose to keep a link to the past by reusing sandstone blocks from the Commercial Club in some of the ground-floor exterior walls. The Simms Building was intended to be a symbol of progress and modernity for the growing city of Albuquerque.\n\nConstruction on the building started in September 1952 and was finished just over two years later in November 1954. The original construction cost was about $2 million. The new building was the tallest in New Mexico, surpassing the First National Bank Building, and boasted novel features like the first use of Thermopane insulating glass in the southwest and an innovative radiant panel heating and cooling system. The Simms Building attracted notice both locally and nationally—it was featured in its own issue of \"Albuquerque Progress\", a monthly journal published by Albuquerque National Bank, and it was written up in the national publications \"Progressive Architecture\" in 1955 (with photos by Julius Shulman) and \"Architectural Forum\" in 1957. According to the \"Progressive Architecture\" piece,\n\nThe building was sold to Sandia Savings and Loan Association in 1973 for $1.75 million and was renamed Sandia Savings Building, though the Simms name persisted in local usage. Sandia Savings made a number of changes to the building, enclosing the open-air promenade on the 13th floor for more office space, expanding the ground-level retail area, and adding a multilevel parking garage. The projects added about of space and cost $1.6 million. In 1993 it was given minor renovations and the official name was changed to Simms Tower. A more thorough, $7 million renovation was completed in 2014, including upgrades to the plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems while maintaining the building's historic character.\n\nThe building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1997 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The building was considered \"exceptionally significant\", justifying its inclusion even though it was only 44 years old at the time.\n\nDesigned by the firm of Flatow and Moore, the Simms Building was one of the first International style buildings in Albuquerque (one earlier example, albeit on a much smaller scale, is John Gaw Meem's Southern Union Gas Company Building built in 1951). The building is tall and has 13 floors supported by a reinforced concrete frame with 24 columns in a 3-by-8 grid. The ground floor covers most of the block and includes a small courtyard on the north side; most of the exterior walls are aluminum-framed glass but some portions use the recycled sandstone from the Commercial Club. The second story is recessed flush with the structural columns and again mostly glass. Above this is the main ten-story block of the building, faced with a steel-framed curtain wall of Thermopane glass and aluminum panels on the north and south sides, and brick over structural clay tile on the windowless east and west sides. It projects over the ground floor to form covered arcades at the east and west ends, with three columns on each side exposed as pilotis. The recessed thirteenth floor is modeled after the first floor and was added in the 1970s by enclosing the open promenade that originally topped the building.\n\nAs Albuquerque's first modernist highrise, the building's architecture was very influential locally. For instance, the nearby New Mexico Bank & Trust Building has a very similar design, and many other buildings in the city were inspired either directly or indirectly by the Simms Building.\n\nUpon opening in 1954, the Simms Building had an innovative heating and cooling system designed by the engineering firm of Bridgers and Paxton. During normal operation, groundwater from onsite deep wells, available at year-round, was heated or cooled as needed using a heat pump and then circulated through radiant panels built into the exterior curtain walls. In winter, the system could also take advantage of solar heating, in effect using the building's sunny southern side as a giant solar collector which could then provide heat to the northern side. At times, the heating and cooling loads were balanced so that the system could operate self-sufficiently on solar energy alone. This idea was developed further in the all-solar heating system Bridgers and Paxton designed two years later for their pioneering Solar Building.\n\nWhile the system was efficient, it was not without problems. The fact that spent water from the system was re-deposited in the ground after use meant that additives could not be used without contaminating the groundwater, and corrosion soon became an issue. Eventually, it was converted to a closed system in 1965. Afterwards, the system was not properly maintained and stopped working in the 1970s. It was ultimately replaced with conventional heating and cooling systems, somewhat ironically just as the original design was attracting renewed attention due to the 1970s energy crisis.\n\nThe Simms Building appeared frequently in the popular AMC series \"Breaking Bad\", where it portrayed the DEA office of character Agent Hank Schrader.\n"}

He signed his first professional contract for Bayern Munich on 1 July 2005. He played for Germany's U-21 Team. Ottl is a highly versatile player being able to play various midfield positions as well as playing as a defender.\n\nOttl began playing for Bayern Munich in 1996 after his parents had originally refused to let him leave hometown club Nord Lerchenau for Bayern. He played for the Junior Team where he won three youth championships, before being promoted to the reserve team in 2003. During the 2003–04 season, in the Regionalliga Süd, Ottl scored a goal in 25 matches. He would go to score five goals in 34 matches and make four appearances in the German Cup the following season.<ref name=\"Spieler-Statistik 2004/05\"></ref> Having become a key player of the reserve team in the third division, he was given the chance to play for the senior team in 2005. At the time, Ottl was one of six players (along with Philipp Lahm, Christian Lell, Stephan Fürstner, Sandro Wagner) of the Bayern Munich junior team to feature in the Bundesliga squad. He signed professional forms on 1 July 2005, his first full-time contract, thus following in the footsteps of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Owen Hargreaves and others.\n\nOn 13 August 2005, Ottl made his debut for Bayern Munich, coming on as a substitute for Hasan Salihamidžić in a 5–2 win over Bayer Leverkusen. On 15 October 2005, Ottl made his first start in a 3–0 win over Schalke 04 and played 90 minutes. On 5 June 2006, Ottl scored his first goal against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in a 1–1 draw. In his first season, Ottl scored a goal in only eight league appearances<ref name=\"Spieler-Statistik 2005/06\"></ref> and the club won the league title. He also scored two goals in 18 appearances during the 2005–06 Regionalliga season for the reserve team. The following season, Ottl made 24 appearances.<ref name=\"Spieler-Statistik 2006/07\"></ref> He scored his only Bundesliga goal of the season against Schalke. He made his Champions League debut in a 2–0 win over Inter Milan where he received a booking and played 90 minutes. Under Ottmar Hitzfeld, Ottl got more playing time and more often used often because he could play all positions in the midfield or central defense. He also scored a goal in two matches in the German Cup, played in two German League Cup matches, and played in seven Champions League matches.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Ottl featured less, making 19 appearances. Ottl soon found himself lower in the pecking order and once again spent time on the bench after the arrival of Mark van Bommel and Franck Ribéry. This led Ottl to consider leaving the club in order to secure first-team football if he failed to be given enough games in the coming months. However, Ottl did not leave the club that season winning another league title and the DFB-Pokal with Bayern. He also made three German Cup appearances, three German League Cup matches, and eight UEFA Cup matches. After the 2008–09 season with 22 appearances, he played less under new manager Louis van Gaal. Earlier in the season, Ottl was among players who should be sold but Ottl insisted he wanted to stay at the club. He also had four German Cup appearances and six Champions League appearances. He made four Bundesliga appearances,<ref name=\"Spiele als Spieler 2009/2010\"></ref> one German Cup appearance, and four Champions League appearances during the 2009–10 season for Bayern Munich. Ottl, along with teammate Breno, was loaned out on 1 January 2010 to 1. FC Nürnberg for the remainder of the season.\n\nIn order to get more first team opportunities, Ottl was loaned out to 1. FC Nürnberg, along with Breno, from January 2010 to June 2010. On 17 January 2010, Ottl made his debut for the club in a 1–0 loss against Schalke 04. Since making his debut, Ottl established himself in the starting eleven. In the last game of the season on 8 May 2010, Ottl scored his only goal in the game as Nürnberg won 1–0, ending a four-match drought without a win. The club avoided relegation when they won the Bundesliga play-offs against FC Augsburg. The club won 3–0 on aggregate to stay in the Bundesliga. He finished his loan spell with a goal in 17 league appearances, no German Cup appearances, and two relegation playoff appearances.\n\nAfter his loan-spell at 1. FC Nürnberg, Ottl returned and vowed to fight for a place in the side as he tried to break into the first team. He played in the German Super Cup. In the first half of the season, Ottl replaced captain van Bommel. On 20 November 2011, Ottl made his 100th appearance for Bayern Munich in a 1–1 draw against Bayer Leverkusen. In the round of 16 of the DFB-Pokal on 22 December 2010, Ottl scored his first goal in over two years in 6–3 thriller win over Stuttgart. He finished the season with 15 league appearances, a goal in three German Cup appearances, three Champions League appearances, and a German Super Cup appearance.\n\nOttl played 109 Bundesliga games scoring nine goals. In the Champions League he played 20 matches. He won three German championships and three cups as a Bayern Munich player.\n\nOn 21 May 2011, Andreas Ottl became the fourth new signing for Hertha BSC after he signed a three-year contract with the club on a free transfer following his released by Bayern Munich. He had been a Bayern Munich player for 15 years before joining Hertha BSC on 1 July. Ottl scored on his Hertha BSC debut in the 4–0 win over ZFC Meuselwitz on 31 July 2011 in the DFB-Pokal. On 6 August 2011, Ottl made his league debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Nürnberg. On 11 February 2012, Ottl received a straight red card in a 5–0 loss against Stuttgart.\n\nOn 16 October 2011, Ottl returned for the first time with Hertha back to his old club Bayern Munich which turned out to be a quite bitter reunion for Ottl; the Berlin club lost 0–4. Prior to the game, Ottl and two other members of Hertha (Christian Lell and Thomas Kraft) were honored with a bouquet of flowers by the Bayern staff and the fans were chanting pro Ottl throughout the game.\n\nHe was released on 6 June 2012, along with several other players, after the club was relegated from the Bundesliga. He finished his only season at Hertha with 26 Bundesliga appearances and a goal in three German Cup appearances.\n\nOn 9 July 2012, Ottl signed for FC Augsburg on a two-year deal. Ottl made 16 appearances during the 2012–13 season; failing to score a goal. The limited number of appearances was partially due to an injury he picked up against Bayern Munich. Ottl failed to make any appearances during the 2013–14 season despite being fit. Ottl's contract expired without any extension.\n\nOttl stated he wanted to play for a team outside of Germany because the Bundesliga \"no longer interests him.\" He had several offers and was in negotiations with two European clubs from outside Germany. He was still without a contract when the January 2016 transfer window closed.\n\nOttl, in 2017, became a member of the performance acceleration technology company, RippleWorx, Inc., to work with the company founders: Jonas Hummels, Dr. Timo Sandritter, Angie Sandritter, Jason DeVine, Brian Hadley, Amanda Bolan, and Keith Hermann. \n\nOttl was born in Munich, West Germany on 1 March 1985. Ottl is long-time friends with Philipp Lahm who like to play snooker and tennis together. His girlfriend started an online company for home furnishings.

{"id": "2159346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159346", "title": "Banzai Pipeline", "text": "Banzai Pipeline\n\nThe Banzai Pipeline, or simply Pipeline or Pipe, is a surf reef break located in Hawaii, off Ehukai Beach Park in Pupukea on O'ahu's North Shore. A reef break is an area in the ocean where waves start to break once they reach the shallows of a reef. Pipeline is known for huge waves that break in shallow water just above a sharp and cavernous reef, forming large, hollow, thick curls of water that surfers can tube ride. There are three reefs at Pipeline in progressively deeper water farther out to sea that activate according to the increasing size of approaching ocean swells.\n\nThe location's compound name combines the name of the surf break (Pipeline) with the name of the beach fronting it (Banzai Beach). It got its name in December 1961, when surfing legend producer Bruce Brown was driving up north with Californians Phil Edwards and Mike Diffenderfer. Bruce stopped at the then-unnamed site to film Phil catching several waves. At the time, there was a construction project on an underground pipeline on adjacent Kamehameha Highway, and Mike made the suggestion to name the break \"Pipeline\". The name was first used in Bruce Brown's movie \"Surfing Hollow Days.\" It also lent its name to a 1963 hit \"Pipeline\" by surf music rockers The Chantays.\n\nThe reef at Pipe is a flat tabletop reef, with several caverns on the inside, creating a giant air bubble that pops on the front of the wave when the wave lurches upwards just before breaking. There are also several jagged, underwater lava spires that can injure fallen surfers. Sand can accumulate on the reef at Pipeline, and that can cause waves to \"close out\" (meaning the hollow tube of the wave collapses all at once and thus is impossible to surf). A strong swell (a formation of long-wavelength surface waves) from the west clears out the sand in the reef, and after that, a strong north swell can give rise to the best waves. \n\nThere are four waves associated with Pipeline. The left (which means the wave breaks from left to right from the perspective of a watcher on shore) known as Pipeline (a.k.a. First Reef) is the most commonly surfed and photographed. When the reef is hit by a north swell, the peak (the highest tipping-point of the wave where it begins to curl) becomes an A-frame shaped wave, with Pipe closing out a bit and peeling off left, and the equally famous Backdoor Pipeline peeling away to the right at the same time. As the size at Pipe increases, over 12 feet usually, Second Reef on the outside (further out into the deeper ocean waters) starts breaking, with longer walls (the unbroken face of the wave that the surfer slides across), and more size. At an extreme size an area called Third Reef even further outside starts to break with giant waves.\n\nNumerous surfers and photographers have been killed at Pipeline, including Jon Mozo and Tahitian Malik Joyeux, who was famous for his heavy charging (gutsy surfing) at Teahupo'o. Many people have died or been seriously injured at Pipeline. Pipeline has been called one of the world's deadliest waves. Its average wave is 9 feet (3 m), but it can be as tall as 20 feet. Especially perilous are sections of shallow reef known as \"Off the Wall\" and \"Backdoor\". \n\nA few of the notable surfers at Pipeline are Phil Edwards (surfer) (who is credited as the first person to surf it), Butch Van Artsdalen, Gerry Lopez, Mike Stewart, Shaun Tomson, Mark Richards, Wayne 'Rabbit' Bartholomew, Peter Townend, Michael Ho, Simon Anderson, Tom Carroll, Sunny Garcia, Kelly Slater, Danny Fuller, Jamie O'Brien, Rob Machado, Andy Irons, Mick Fanning, Gabriel Medina, John John Florence and Italo Ferreira.\n\nThe top surfing competitions at this spot include the Pipe Masters (board surfing), the Volcom Pipe Pro, the IBA Pipeline Pro (bodyboarding), and the Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic. Surfers can also submit videos to Surfline's \"Wave of the Winter\" competition. The competition focuses on beaches on Oahu's north shore, including Pipeline.\n\n\n"}

It aired as a Disney Channel Original Movie, premiering on the Disney Channel on Friday, October 13, 2000.\n\n13-year-old Adam Hansen (Matt O'Leary) and his best friend Duffy (Jake Epstein) have some tickets for the Headless Horseman concert, and his sister 16-year-old Chelsea (Laura Vandervoort) has a date with her dreamy boyfriend Peter. The only problem is, they are both grounded: Adam is punished because he did not do his homework, instead making up a story using an article from the magazine \"The Weekly Secret\", and Chelsea because she called Adam a dweeb, which their mother, Lynette (Caroline Rhea), happened to hear. Chelsea and Adam will do whatever it takes to get their mother out of the house, even if it includes a chance meeting with a very mysterious man named Dimitri (Charles Shaughnessy). Everything seems to go according to plan, until their 8-year-old little brother Taylor (Myles Jeffrey) realizes that Dimitri is a vampire.\n\nHis brother and sister do not believe Taylor, so he calls Malachi Van Helsing (Robert Carradine), the vampire hunter. The night that their mother goes out with Dimitri, Taylor follows them. Not wanting their mother to come home and extend their punishments, they follow Taylor and find him outside the restaurant that Lynette and Dimitri are at. Adam and Taylor make the vampire do the spoon test (a fake test made up by Adam to get Taylor to stop calling Dimitri a vampire). Afterwards, Adam discovers that Taylor was right about Dimitri being a vampire when he looks in the mirror and notices Dimitri does not have a reflection. So, along with Chelsea, he sets out to stop Dimitri, who puts their mother in a trance and plans to take her to his mansion. Meanwhile, Malachi Van Helsing arrives and begins to hunt down Dimitri, only to discover that he was being followed by Taylor, who (after learning the spoon test was made up by Adam) had also set out to save his mother from Dimitri.\n\nIn the end, Taylor becomes Van Helsing's partner and they arrive to do battle with Dimitri, who has Lynette in a trance, but even together Taylor, Adam, Chelsea and Van Helsing are unable to defeat Dimitri. Dimitri goes to bite a powerless Adam, but he and Chelsea call out to Lynette, breaking her trance (as only true love for someone can break a vampire's trance). She throws Dimitri into his coffin. Van Helsing seals the coffin with silver-plated nails and explains that he plans to send it to a place where it's always sunny. Shortly after Dimitri is sealed up, Van Helsing asks their mother out on a \"date\", after which Adam, Chelsea and Taylor, believing they have heard the word \"date\" enough for one night, try to convince her to stay single which is when Lynette confesses, \"I date. Just not vampires\". Finally, they all decide to go back to the Hansen house for breakfast as the sun is finally rising.\n\n\n"}

He played in several positions, but was preferred as a striker or midfielder. Johnsen is 188 cm tall, and was a good header of the ball.\n\nIn his final season for Odds BK in 2015, Johnsen won the Kniksen's Honour Award for his long career as a footballer. He retired in the age of 41. In 2013, he became the topscorer in Tippeligaen, which also made him the oldest topscorer in a European league ever.\n\nJohnsen began his career with minnows Skotfoss TIF, but did not make his Tippeligaen debut until a switch to Odd Grenland where he made his debut in the Norwegian Premier League in 1999 at the age of 25.\n\nHe was transferred to Rosenborg mid-season in 2000, as a replacement for John Carew. Johnsen previously studied to be a police officer during his time in Odd Grenland, but quit school to play for Rosenborg. He played fifteen games for Rosenborg in his first season, scoring 9 goals – 12 in total, as he scored 3 goals for Odd before the switch. His new club and he won the championship. Rosenborg narrowly missed out on qualifying from the group stage of the Champions League. Johnsen did very well, scoring five goals in six games – including a hat-trick against Helsingborg. As they finished third, they advanced to the UEFA Cup where they crashed out in the first round to Alavés, Johnsen scored the goal in the 1–1 away leg, but could not prevent Rosenborg from losing 3–1 at home.\n\nIn his first full season he became joint top-scorer with 17 goals (shared with Thorstein Helstad and Clayton Zane), playing in all games but one. Rosenborg won the league again by a single point ahead of Lillestrøm. In the Champions League Rosenborg finished fourth in their group. Johnsen played in all six games but one and did not score any goals, though he netted one in the qualifiers.\n\nJohnsen won his third championship in a row in 2002.

Johnsen scored 15 goals, only beaten with two by teammate Harald Brattbakk. He also won the cup with Rosenborg over Bodø/Glimt, scoring the equaliser as Rosenborg eventually won 3–1. He was the top scorer of the cup, scoring 11 goals in 7 games. In the Champions League, Rosenborg and Johnsen failed to reach the group stage, losing narrowly to Deportivo in the qualifiers. They still got to play UEFA Cup, and had a good run before losing on away goals to Benfica. Johnsen played in all but one game in Europe this season, scoring 2 goals in 9 games.\n\nThe 2004 season was dramatic and very memorable season for Frode Johnsen. Rosenborg fought with Vålerenga for the championship, and before the last game of the season, Rosenborg was in the lead, but only on more scored goals. 7 minutes from time in Rosenborg's game against FC Lyn, Vålerenga made it 3–0 in their league game. Rosenborg was leading 3–1 at the time and needed one more to win the league, and in stoppage time Frode Johnsen scored his third of the game with a diving header, winning the championship . Johnsen played in all game and was named top scorer that year, notching up 19 goals in the process. He did not score as many in Europe, but nevertheless, Rosenborg was back in the Champions League. Only two points this time, and Johnsen scored 2 goals in total (w/ Q-rounds).\n\nAfter winning five championships in a row, the 2005 season was a devastating one as his team only finished 7th. Johnsen scored only 7 goals in his 23 games that season. In 2005, both RCD Mallorca and AC Sparta Prague were interested in signing Johnsen, but nothing happened. He was involved in all Champions League games, but did not score. They finished third in a group which contained Real Madrid, Lyon and Olympiacos, but was eliminated in the first UEFA Cup round against FC Zenit St. Petersburg.\n\nFrode Johnsen started the season well, and halfway through the season he had scored 6 goals in 13 games before Nagoya Grampus Eight came knocking. Johnsen could not resist the chance of going to play abroad and after serving Rosenborg faithfully for a number of years, they let him go and sold him in July 2006.\n\nIn all competitions, Johnsen played 234 games and scored 125 goals for Rosenborg.\n\nHe signed an 18-month contract and started his Nagoya career by scoring twice in an away match against JEF United Chiba on 29 July 2006. Nagoya won the match 3–2. He scored eight more times finishing with 10 goals in 18 games as Nagoya Grampus finished in 7th place.\n\nIn his first full season in 2007, Nagoya only managed an 11th place. He scored 13 goals in 26 games.\n\nIn 2008, Johnsen and Nagoya fought for the J1 League championship until the final day, but ended up in third place, qualifying for an Asian Champions league spot.\n\nOn 28 October 2008, Frode Johnsen stated that he would stay in Japan for at least one more year, either for Nagoya or another Japanese club.\n\nOn 18 November 2008, Frode Johnsen announced that he would be leaving Nagoya after this season, and that he was only a medical away from securing a move to another Japanese club. He did not reveal which club it was until the 2008 season was over. It was eventually known that he would join Shimizu S-Pulse for the 2009 season.\n\nShimizu S-Pulse finished in 7th place in his first season and five points from an AFC Champions League place, as Johnsen scored 9 league goals.\n\nOn 1 August Johnsen scored his first hat-trick in the J-League in a 6–3 win against Shonan Bellmare.\n\nOn 14 November 2010, Johnsen scored one goal in a 5–0 win against Shonan Bellmare in what will be his last league game in Japan. He has announced that he will return to Norway after this season.\n\nFrode Johnsen has 34 caps, and has scored 10 goals for the Norwegian national team. He made his debut against Finland on 16 August 2000 coming on for Steffen Iversen 20 minutes from time.\n\nHis first international goal came against Wales in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier. He remained a regular member of the Norway squad until 2007, but lost his place after moving to Japan. The long flight distance between Europe and Japan was cited as one of the reasons why he did not play in more games after joining Nagoya Grampus.\n\nOn 1 September 2013, Johnsen was recalled to the national team squad, more than six years after his last cap, ahead of the 2014 World Cup qualifying matches against Cyprus and Switzerland. He did not play in either match, but kept his place in the squad for the matches against Slovenia and Iceland in October 2013. In the match against Slovenia on 11 October 2013, Johnsen came on as a late substitute, becoming the oldest player ever to play for the Norwegian national team. He repeated the feat in the home match against Iceland four days later, at the age of .\n\n234 matches – 125 goals\n\nRosenborg\n\n\n"}

When it became available in systems in 2007, it succeeded the POWER5+ as IBM's flagship Power microprocessor. It is claimed to be part of the eCLipz project, said to have a goal of converging IBM's server hardware where practical (hence \"ipz\" in the acronym: iSeries, pSeries, and zSeries).\n\nPOWER6 was described at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) in February 2006, and additional details were added at the Microprocessor Forum in October 2006 and at the next ISSCC in February 2007. It was formally announced on May 21, 2007. It was released on June 8, 2007 at speeds of 3.5, 4.2 and 4.7 GHz, but the company has noted prototypes have reached 6 GHz. POWER6 reached first silicon in the middle of 2005, and was bumped to 5.0 GHz in May 2008 with the introduction of the P595.\n\nThe POWER6 is a dual-core processor. Each core is capable of two-way simultaneous multithreading (SMT). The POWER6 has approximately 790 million transistors and is 341 mm large fabricated on a 65 nm process. A notable difference from POWER5 is that the POWER6 executes instructions in-order instead of out-of-order. This change often requires software to be recompiled for optimal performance, but the POWER6 still achieves significant performance improvements over the POWER5+ even with unmodified software, according to the lead engineer on the POWER6 project.\n\nPOWER6 also takes advantage of ViVA-2, Virtual Vector Architecture, which enables the combination of several POWER6 nodes to act as a single vector processor.\nEach core has two integer units, two binary floating-point units, an AltiVec unit, and a novel decimal floating-point unit. The binary floating-point unit incorporates \"many microarchitectures, logic, circuit, latch and integration techniques to achieve [a] 6-cycle, 13-FO4 pipeline\", according to a company paper. Unlike the servers from IBM's competitors, the POWER6 has hardware support for IEEE 754 decimal arithmetic and includes the first decimal floating-point unit integrated in silicon. More than 50 new floating point instructions handle the decimal math and conversions between binary and decimal. This feature was also added to the z10 microprocessor featured in the System z10.\n\nEach core has a 64 KB, four-way set-associative instruction cache and a 64 KB data cache of an eight-way set-associative design with a two-stage pipeline supporting two independent 32-bit reads or one 64-bit write per cycle. Each core has semi-private 4 MiB unified L2 cache, where the cache is assigned a specific core, but the other has a fast access to it. The two cores share a 32 MiB L3 cache which is off die, using an 80 GB/s bus.\nPOWER6 can connect to up to 31 other processors using two inter node links (50 GB/s), and supports up to 10 logical partitions per core (up to a limit of 254 per system). There is an interface to a service processor that monitors and adjusts performance and power according to set parameters.\n\nIBM also makes use of a 5 GHz duty-cycle correction clock distribution network for the processor. In the network, the company implements a copper distribution wire that is 3 μm wide and 1.2 μm thick. The POWER6 design uses dual power supplies, a logic supply in the 0.8-to-1.2 Volt range and an SRAM power supply at about 150-mV higher.\n\nThe thermal characteristics of POWER6 are similar to that of the POWER5. Dr Frank Soltis, an IBM chief scientist, said IBM had solved power leakage problems associated with high frequency by using a combination of 90 nm and 65 nm parts in the POWER6 design.\n\nThe slightly enhanced POWER6+ was introduced in April 2009, but had been shipping in Power 560 and 570 systems since October 2008. It added more memory keys for secure memory partition, a feature taken from IBM's mainframe processors.\n\n, the range of POWER6 systems includes \"Express\" models (the 520, 550 and 560) and Enterprise models (the 570 and 595). The various system models are designed to serve any sized business.\nFor example, the 520 Express is marketed to small businesses while the Power 595 is marketed for large, multi-environment data centers. \nThe main difference between the Express and Enterprise models is that the latter include Capacity Upgrade on Demand (CUoD) capabilities and hot-pluggable processor and memory \"books\".\n\nIBM also offers four POWER6 based blade servers. Specifications are shown in the table below.\n\nAll blades support AIX, i, and Linux. The BladeCenter S and H chassis is supported for blades running AIX, i, and Linux. The BladeCenter E, HT, and T chassis support blades running AIX and Linux but not i.\n\nAt the SuperComputing 2007 (SC07) conference in Reno a new water-cooled Power 575 was revealed. The 575 is composed of 2U \"nodes\" each with 32 POWER6 cores at 4.7 GHz with up to 256 GB of RAM. Up to 448 cores can be installed in a single frame.\n\n\n\n"}

The oldest known reference to a Thuringian sausage is located in the Thuringian State Archive in Rudolstadt in a transcript of a bill from an Arnstadt convent from the year 1404. The oldest known recipe dates from 1613 and is kept in the State Archive in Weimar, another is listed in the \"Thüringisch-Erfurtische Kochbuch\" from 1797 which also mentions a smoked variety.\n\nOnly finely minced pork, beef, or sometimes veal, is used in production. Most of the meat comes from the upper part from around the shoulder. In addition to salt and pepper, caraway, marjoram, and garlic are used. The specific spice mixtures can vary according to traditional recipes or regional tastes. At least 51% of the ingredients must come from the state of Thuringia. These ingredients are blended together and filled into a pig or sheep intestine. Thuringian sausages are distinguished from the dozens of unique types of German wursts by the distinctive spices (which includes marjoram) and their low fat content (25% as compared to up to 60% in other sausages).\n\nAccording to German minced meat law, the \"Hackfleischverordnung\", raw sausages must be sold on the day of their creation or until the closing of a late-night establishment. Previously grilled sausages have a shelf-life of 15 days, and sausages immediately frozen after their creation may be stored for 6 months.\n\nThe preferred preparation method for Thuringian sausage is roasted over charcoal or on a grill rubbed with bacon. The fire shouldn't be so hot that the skin breaks. However, some charring is desired. The sausages are sometimes sprinkled with beer during the grilling process.\n\nUsually, a Thuringian sausage is presented in a cut-open roll and served with mustard.\n\nFor the people of Thuringia, grilled Thuringian sausage is not merely the local cuisine. The grill is at the very core of Thuringian culture. Mostly beer instead of water is used to cool the grill, and the type of grill is a matter of doctrine. Mustard, preferably local, is the traditional condiment. Most commonly used is \"Born mustard\" from a local food company in Erfurt. In some regions (e.g. Sonneberg) the usage of any relish - even mustard - is a strict taboo. In eastern of Thuringia most commonly used is \"Bautz’ner\" mustard.\n\nIn 2006, the \"Deutsches Bratwurstmuseum\", opened in Holzhausen, part of the Wachsenburggemeinde near Arnstadt, the first museum devoted exclusively to the Thuringian sausage.\n\nIn North America, the term \"Thuringer\" refers to Thuringer cervelat, a type of smoked semi-dry sausage similar to summer sausage. It is made from a medium grind of beef, blended with salt, cure ingredients, spices (usually including dry mustard), and a lactic acid starter culture. After stuffing into a fibrous casing, it is smoked and dried, then cooked. Hormel Foods Corporation and Usinger's, as well as many regional processors and some small butcher shops, produce the sausage in this fashion\n\nPrior to Thüringian sausages acquiring PGI status in the EU, a type of Luxembourgish sausage was locally known as a Thüringer. It is now referred to as \"Lëtzebuerger Grillwurscht\" ().\n\n"}

He was the editor-in-chief of MacMillan's eight-volume \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" from 1967, and lectured at New York University, Brooklyn College and the New School for Social Research from the 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nEdwards was born Paul Eisenstein in Vienna in 1923 to assimilated Jewish parents, the youngest of three brothers. According to Peter Singer, his upbringing was non-religious. He distinguished himself early on as a gifted student and was admitted to the Akademisches Gymnasium, a prestigious Viennese high school. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Edwards was sent by his family to Scotland, later joining them in Melbourne, Australia, where the family name was changed to Edwards. He attended Melbourne High School, graduating as dux of the school, then studied philosophy at the University of Melbourne, completing a B.A. and M.A.\n\nHe was awarded a scholarship to study in England in 1947, but on his way there, he stopped in New York and ended up staying there for the rest of his life, apart from a brief period teaching at the University of California in Berkeley. He was awarded his doctorate by Columbia University in 1951. While writing his doctoral thesis he contacted Bertrand Russell because he shared Russell's scepticism about religious belief. This led to a lasting friendship and a number of joint projects. Edwards collected Russell's writings on religion and published them in 1957, with an appendix on \"the Bertrand Russell case,\" under the title \"Why I am not a Christian\". He taught at New York University until 1966, at Brooklyn College from then until 1986, and at the New School from the 1960s until 1999.\n\nEdwards was characterized by Michael Wreen as \"mixed one part analytic philosopher to one part \"philosophe\"\" with \"a deep respect for science and common sense.\" His considerable influence on moral philosophy came from two works he edited, a very widely used introductory anthology he co-edited with Arthur Pap, \"A Modern Introduction to Philosophy\" (1957, 1965, 1973) and the \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" (1967), an eight-volume \"massive Enlightenment work with notable analytic sensibility.\"\n\nHe was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nPhilosopher Timothy Madigan wrote in an obituary: \"Those who knew Edwards will always remember his erudition and his wicked sense of humour. [ ... ] Given Paul's own biting wit, it's not surprising that he so admired Voltaire and Russell. [ ... ] Never one to hide his own unbelief, he often commented that his two main goals were to demolish the influence of Heidegger and keep alive the memory of Wilhelm Reich, the much-reviled psychoanalyst whose critiques of religion Edwards felt remained valid.\" Edwards was also sympathetic to the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, although he detested Kierkegaardian existentialist admirers such as Heidegger and William Barrett for confusing and conflating Kierkegaardian terminology.\n\nEdwards was editor-in-chief of Macmillan's \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", published in 1967. With eight volumes and nearly 1,500 entries by over 500 contributors, it is one of the monumental works of twentieth century philosophy. Using his editorial prerogative, Edwards made sure that there were plentiful entries on atheism, materialism and related subjects (which is not surprising considering that such subjects would have been of interest to modern philosophers). He always remained \"a fervent advocate of clarity and rigour in philosophical argument.\" When, after four decades, the \"Encyclopedia\" was revised by other editors for a new edition, Edwards told Peter Singer that he was \"distressed that the revisions had diluted the philosophical message and had been too gentle on a lot of postmodern thought.\"\n\nEdwards was highly skeptical of claims regarding reincarnation. He was the author of the book \"Reincarnation: A Critical Examination\" (1996), which is notable for criticizing the cases collected by Ian Stevenson. The book has received positive reviews from academics. Barry Beyerstein wrote that \"Skeptics who follow my recommendation and read \"Reincarnation: A Critical Examination\" will derive much ammunition for arguing not only with reincarnationists but with 'near-death experience' aficionados and afterlife enthusiasts of other stripes as well.\" Philosopher and parapsychologist Stephen E. Braude criticized the arguments presented in Edwards book, saying, \"Apparently Edwards did not realize that his condescending and allegedly hard-nosed attack on reincarnationists was as deeply (and inevitably) metaphysical as the view he opposed.\"\n\nEdwards said that when he arrived in New York in 1947 Wilhelm Reich was \"the talk of the town\" and that for years he and his friends regarded Reich as \"something akin to a messiah\": \"There was ... a widespread feeling that Reich had an original and penetrating insight into the troubles of the human race.\" Twenty years later, as editor-in-chief of the \"Encyclopedia of Philosophy,\" Edwards wrote an article about Reich, comprising 11 pages as compared to the four devoted to Sigmund Freud. He pointed out what is of interest to philosophers in Reich: his views concerning the origin of religious and metaphysical needs, the relation between the individual and society and the possibility of social progress, and, above all, the implications of his psychiatry for certain aspects of the mind-body problem. An abridged version of the article appeared in the \"Encyclopedia of Unbelief\" (ed. Gordon Stein, 1985).\n\nEdwards omitted Reich's orgone therapy from the \"Encyclopedia\" article because, he said, \"it is of no philosophical interest.\" However, in a BBC interview he said somewhat more: \"I concede that Reich had no real competence as a physicist... At the same time I am quite convinced that the orgone theory cannot be complete nonsense. For a number of years, largely out of curiosity, I sat in an orgone accumulator once a day.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is now widely referred to as a suburb. 'Stanway' is an Anglo-Saxon name for the 'stone way' of the Roman road, now the A12.\n\nStanway is approximately three miles west of Colchester town centre on the B1408 (former A12), near the junction of the A12 and the A1124 at Eight Ash Green. Colchester Zoo, The Stanway School, Tollgate shopping complex and the Co-operative retail development are among prominent local amenities. Graham Coxon and Damon Albarn, founder members of Blur, met at the local school, The Stanway School.\n\nStanway is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.\n\nThe £4.3m A12 bypass opened in 1970. Local pubs include the Princess Charlotte (the first pub in the UK to be named after Princess Charlotte of Cambridge) and the Swan on London Road, and Live and Let Live on Millers Lane.\n\nThere are three schools – two primary schools and The Stanway School which has academy status, and describes itself as a \"Humanities and Maths & Computing College\". All three of the schools are close together, on adjacent roads.\n\nAn electoral ward with the same name exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 8,283.\n\nIn the early Medieval period Stanway had two churches; All Saints' next to Stanway Hall, and St Albright's in Little Stanway on the London Road (now the B1408). All Saints' church, first recorded in about 1260, had fallen out of use during the 16th century, but was repaired and the chancel and north aisle were demolished in about 1605 by Sir John Swinterton, when it became the private chapel to Stanway Hall. In the early 18th century the church was said to be \"utterly decayed\" and remains a ruin.\n\nThe current Church of England parish church is dedicated to Saint Albright, who is generally identified with Saint Ethelbert the King, a king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia, who was killed in 794 AD. It was in existence in the late 11th century and was a parish church soon afterwards but was referred to as a chapel in later documents. The oldest parts of the present building date from the 12th century and incorporate Roman bricks in the heads of some of the windows. A new chancel was added in 1880 when the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott.\n\nIn 1996, prior to the expansion of the Stanway Sand & Gravel quarry, an archaeological team was called in to investigate the outline of five ancient ditched enclosures identified by aerial photography. There, just off the A12 to Colchester, they discovered the grave of the \"Druid of Colchester\".\n\nStanway has a Non-League football club Stanway Rovers F.C. who play at New Farm Road.\n"}

Because waiting time forms part of the costs of transportation, the Mohring effect implies increasing returns to scale for scheduled urban transport services. \n\nThe effect was named for the University of Minnesota economist Herbert Mohring, who identified this property in a 1972 paper.\n\nFor example, suppose that passengers arrive randomly at a bus stop over the course of an hour, while the bus arrives once per hour. The average waiting time is 30 minutes. If the number of passengers per hour increases sufficiently to justify two buses per hour, then the average waiting time falls to 15 minutes. The presence of additional users lowers the cost of existing passengers. This anti-congestion effect is opposite to the usual road congestion effect, where an increase in the number of the users decreases the speed and the quality of service of the other users.\n\nThe Mohring effect is often referenced in support of transit subsidies, on the grounds that subsidy is required to achieve marginal cost pricing when the Mohring effect is relevant. The average cost of a passenger-journey includes the average waiting time, while the marginal cost includes only the average waiting time less the diminution in total waiting time caused by the increase in frequency. Average cost thus exceeds marginal cost, and subsidy that bridges the gap is said to improve welfare.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2159394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159394", "title": "Les Chants de Maldoror", "text": "Les Chants de Maldoror\n\nLes Chants de Maldoror (\"The Songs of Maldoror\") is a French poetic novel, or a long prose poem. It was written and published between 1868 and 1869 by the Comte de Lautréamont, the \"nom de plume\" of the Uruguayan-born French writer Isidore Lucien Ducasse. The work concerns the misanthropic, misotheistic character of Maldoror, a figure of evil who has renounced conventional morality.\n\nAlthough obscure at the time of its initial publication, \"Maldoror\" was rediscovered and championed by the Surrealist artists during the early twentieth century. The work's transgressive, violent, and absurd themes are shared in common with much of Surrealism's output; in particular, Louis Aragon, André Breton, Salvador Dalí, Man Ray, and Philippe Soupault were influenced by the work. \"Maldoror\" was itself influenced by earlier gothic literature of the period, including Lord Byron's \"Manfred\", and Charles Maturin's \"Melmoth the Wanderer\".\n\n\"Maldoror\" is a modular work primarily divided into six parts, or cantos; these parts are further subdivided into a total of sixty chapters, or verses. Parts one through six consist of fourteen, sixteen, five, eight, seven and ten chapters, respectively. With some exceptions, most chapters consist of a single, lengthy paragraph. The text often employs very long, unconventional and confusing sentences which, together with the dearth of paragraph breaks, may suggest a stream of consciousness, or automatic writing. Over the course of the narrative, there is often a first-person narrator, although some areas of the work instead employ a third-person narrative. The book's central character is Maldoror, a figure of evil who is sometimes directly involved in a chapter's events, or else revealed to be watching at a distance. Depending on the context of narrative voice in a given place, the first-person narrator may be taken to be Maldoror himself, or sometimes not. The confusion between narrator and character may also suggest an unreliable narrator.\n\nSeveral of the parts begin with opening chapters in which the narrator directly addresses the reader, taunts the reader, or simply recounts the work thus far. For example, an early passage warns the reader not to continue:\n\nApart from these opening segments, each chapter is typically an isolated, often surreal episode, which does not seem at first to be directly related to the surrounding material. For example, in one chapter, a funeral procession takes a boy to his grave and buries him, with the officiant condemning Maldoror; the following chapter instead presents a story of a sleeping man (seemingly Maldoror) who is repeatedly bitten by a tarantula which emerges from the corner of his room, every night. Another strange episode occurs in an early chapter: the narrator encounters a giant glow-worm which commands him to kill a woman, who symbolizes prostitution. In defiance, the narrator instead hurls a large stone onto the glow-worm, killing it:\n\nHowever, as the work progresses, certain common themes emerge among the episodes. In particular, there is constant imagery of many kinds of animals, sometimes employed in similes. For example, in one case, Maldoror copulates with a shark, each admiring the others' violent nature, while in another, the narrator has a pleasant dream that he is a hog. These animals are praised precisely for their inhumanity, which fits the work's misanthropic tone:\n\nAnother recurring theme among certain of the chapters is an urban–rural dichotomy. Some episodes take place in a town or city, while others occur at a deserted shore, with only a few actors. The juxtaposition of urban city scenes and rural shoreline scenes may be inspired by Ducasse's time in Paris and Montevideo, respectively. Other pervasive themes include homosexuality, blasphemy and violent crime, often directed against children.\n\n\"Maldoror's\" sixth and final part instead employs a definite change in style, while retaining most of the themes already developed. The final part (specifically its last eight chapters), intended as a \"little novel\" which parodies the forms of the nineteenth-century novel, presents a linear story using simpler language. In it, a schoolboy named Mervyn returns home to his well-to-do family in Paris, unaware that Maldoror had been stalking him. Maldoror writes Mervyn a love letter, requesting to meet, and Mervyn replies and accepts. Upon their meeting, Maldoror forces Mervyn into a sack, and beats his body against the side of a bridge, ultimately flinging the sack onto the dome of the Panthéon. This final, violent episode has been interpreted as a killing of the traditional novel form, in favor of \"Maldoror\"s experimental writing.\n\n\"Les Chants de Maldoror\" is considered to have been a major influence upon French Symbolism, Dada and Surrealism; editions of the book have been illustrated by Odilon Redon, Salvador Dalí and René Magritte. Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani was known to keep a copy of \"Maldoror\" available while traveling in the Montparnasse, sometimes quoting from it. Outsider artist Unica Zürn's literary work \"The Man of Jasmine\" was influenced by \"Maldoror\"; likewise, William T. Vollmann was influenced by the work.\n\n\"Maldoror\" was followed by \"Poésies\", Ducasse's other, minor surviving work, a short work of literary criticism, or poetics. In contrast to \"Maldoror\", \"Poésies\" has a far more positive and humanistic tone, and so may be interpreted as a response to the former. For a more detailed treatment of \"Poésies\", see the author's main article.\n\nA theatrical adaptation titled \"Maldoror\" was co-produced by the La MaMa Experimental Theater Club and the Mickery Theatre (of Amsterdam), and performed by the Camera Obscura experimental theatre company at La MaMa in the East Village of New York City in 1974. The text for the production was written by Camera Obscura and Andy Wolk, with design and direction by Franz Marijnen. \"Maldoror\" also went on tour in Europe in 1974.\n\nIsidore Lucien Ducasse admitted to being inspired by Adam Mickiewicz and the form of The Great Improvisation from third part of the polish bard's Forefathers' Eve\n\n\n"}

It opened its doors in 1996, as part of the multi-purpose Benjamin Vaughan Complex, named for Benjamin Vaughan, the diplomat for which the city is named. The complex contains the high school, Rosemount Community Centre, and the City Playhouse Theatre, to which the school is given limited access. The school is part of the York Region District School Board. Westmount is one of the 29 secondary schools in the board which comprises 191 schools altogether. Westmount is known for its arts program and its strong academic program. Many awards have been given to recognize the art, drama, dance, and music program known as ArtsWest. Mathematics and the sciences were also recognized with York Regional awards. The school is three levels with the first floor hosting many Arts classes and the gymnasium, the second floor is prevalent in languages, and the third floor has many computer based classes, mathematics and sciences.\n\nThe community centre, which is attached to the northern edge of the school, contains an arena, a split gymnasium, and recreational rooms used for different events and programs, such as playing bridge. Rosemount also hosts various summer camps and programs, such as summer stock. The name of the community centre was created by merging the names of two nearby elementary schools and subdivisions, Rosedale and Westmount. The school is given access to the gym and arena throughout the years, such as for the school's hockey team.\n\nAdjoining Westmount from the southern portion of the complex, the City Playhouse is a 386-seat, community-based theatre featuring a wide variety of professional, community and school productions. It also serves the community as a rental house, particularly during the offseason months of May–September. The box office is on the south side of the theatre adjacent to New Westminster Drive. Similar to the community centre, the high school is given access to the theatre for use in assemblies, Westmount drama productions as well as other theatrical shows and the bi-annual musical productions, Springfest and Winterfest. Known productions to frequent the theatre include but are not limited to City Youth Players, Starbeat, Characters, Judy & David, and even the in-house City Playhouse Productions. Marquee Productions was also a major company to produce shows for the theatre, among others in the Greater Toronto Area, but are no longer producing for the City Playhouse theatre having finished their last projects there in April 2012.\n\nAttached to the west side of the complex, the Butternut Child Centre is a preschool which exists for children aged four and younger. There has been a mutual relationship between this nursery's daily functions and Westmount's student body, such as the observation of daycare kids by students taking Human Growth and Development and likewise, the kids being walked around the school during operating hours.\n\nThe complex was built by MCW Consultants in 1995, who later built a similar complex in Newmarket, Ontario, Newmarket High School. It too contains a similar attached community theatre. The older Milliken Mills High School in Markham, Ontario, built in 1988, has a similar layout on the inside to the two; however, it contains a very different façade and décor. All three schools contain a large open atrium with a grand staircase that handles the highest volume of students getting to and from class. Even though these schools are in three different cities, they are all part of the York Region District School Board.\n\nIn 2009, Westmount started to offer an arts program called ArtsWest, where the applicant can either major in Music (Instrumental), Dance, Visual Arts, Vocals, or Drama in the following school year. ArtsWest is the fourth Arts program within York Region.\n\nWestmount has seen over 3,000 graduates since its founding. Notable alumni include Shane Feldman and Sam Schachter. Feldman is a motivational speaker, media producer, and founder of the international charity Count Me In. Schachter is an Olympic beach volleyball player.\n\n"}
{"id": "2159414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159414", "title": "Hans Aanrud", "text": "Hans Aanrud\n\nHans Aanrud (3 September 1863 – 11 January 1953) was a Norwegian author. He wrote plays, poetry, and stories depicting rural life in his native Gudbrandsdal, Norway.\n\nAanrud, who came from a rural family, was born and raised in Auggedalen, a valley in Gausdal (part of Gudbrandsdal). He attended a grammar school and then practised as a private tutor. When he had some success with his literary works he moved to Oslo. There he was a literary and theatre critic. From 1911 to 1923 he was also an adviser at the national theatre of Oslo.\n\nThe Chambers Biographical Dictionary says \"His delightful children's books... deserve their place among the classics\".\n\nAanrud gained fame by his realistic and folksy descriptions of the rural life of his home valley before the industrial age. The way of thinking of the ordinary peasants is presented in partly dialect dialogues and in their simple and friendly mode of expression. The landscape is atmospherically described and most parts of the stories are humorous; there are only sometimes also tragic features. The characters, plot and description of the landscape always form an integrated whole. Often children are the protagonists of Aanruds stories which therefore became popular children’s books. But Aanrud himself had intended his tales for older readers. These tales were soon translated and found wide distribution especially in the rest of Scandinavia, Great Britain and Germany.\n\nOne of the most successful tales by Aanrud is his depiction of \"Sidsel Sidsærk\" (1903), a young Norwegian shepherdess who receives her epithet \"long skirt\" because of her much too long skirt, a Christmas present of her brother. The tale of the young shepherd \"Sölve Solfeng\" (1910), who lives in a valley in Norway, was also widespread. The content of both stories concerns the difficult conditions of the work of the country children who had to eke out a poor existence far away from their parents. In spite of this account of their hard lot an optimistic kind of portrayal is predominant.\n\nTwo translations of shorter stories by Aanrud also achieved great fame in Germany: the tale collections \"Kroppzeug\" (1907) and \"Jungen\" (1910).\n\nThe lower middle-class life in the city was also examined by Aanrud in some comedies in a satiric way, but these comedies were mainly known only in the Norwegian capital and are today nearly forgotten. In the comedy \"Storken\" (= \"stork\", 1895), that is playing in \"Kristiania\" (the former name of Oslo) at the end of the 19th century, a naïve clerk tries to establish contacts to the high society but he is often deceived by a royal authorized representative, who takes advantage of his ignorance. Only at the end the clerk finds out the truth. In this comedy Aanrud mocks at affected and mendacious behaviour. He wanted a positive influence of the healthy rural world on the city life that he regarded as degenerate and rootless; in the end he wanted the rapprochement of the rural and the urban culture.\n\nAanrud's works include:\n\n\n"}

The two were combined into one station in 2002, when the original was reopened and restored, and the newer station rebuilt in matching style.\n\nMoor Street has become more important in recent years; two of the original terminus platforms were reopened in 2010, and the station is now the terminus of many Chiltern Railways services from London Marylebone, as well as being an important stop for local services on the Snow Hill Lines. It is now the second busiest railway station in Birmingham.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th Century, suburban rail traffic into Birmingham was growing rapidly. The Great Western Railway greatly expanded their facilities in the city at that time to cope with the demands. Snow Hill station, their main station in Birmingham, was extensively rebuilt and expanded. However, the twin tracked Snow Hill tunnel, which ran underneath the city centre into Snow Hill from the south, did not have enough capacity to accommodate all of the traffic, and widening the tunnel was considered impractical. In order to solve the capacity problem therefore, Moor Street station was built at the opposite end of the tunnel to take terminating local trains from the south and relieve traffic.\nIt was a terminus for local trains from , and local trains from via the recently opened North Warwickshire Line. It was opened with temporary buildings in July 1909, and the permanent buildings were completed in 1914. The station was located south of the entrance to Snow Hill tunnel, at the end of a short branch (the Moor Street branch) which connected the station to the main line. It originally had a single 700 ft (213 metre) long island platform with two platform faces. A third side platform, 600 ft (183 metres) long was added in 1930. The through tracks to Snow Hill running alongside, however, were not provided with platforms.\n\nBecause the station was built on a confined site, it was equipped with two electrically operated traversers at the buffer end of the platforms as a space saving measure, in order to allow locomotives to move sideways between tracks, instead of having to reverse through crossovers. The traversers were removed from service in 1967, when all services to the station switched to diesel multiple unit operation.\n\nTrains only used Moor Street during Mondays to Saturdays, on Sundays, Snow Hill station was quiet enough to allow the train to terminate there instead.\n\nIn 1948, upon nationalisation, Moor Street came under the control of the Western Region of British Railways, transferring to the London Midland Region, in 1963.\n\nSnow Hill station was run down during the late 1960s, and on 4 March 1968 the line between the junction with the Moor Street branch and Birmingham Snow Hill, including Snow Hill tunnel closed, leaving Moor Street as an isolated terminus for local trains. Moor Street itself came under threat of closure in 1969, however five local authorities objected and took the case to the High Court, which sided with the local authorities, preventing closure.\n\nFrom 1967 until the mid-1970s, Moor Street was at its lowest ebb; the infrequent local trains used Moor Street during peak hours only, at other times they ran to and from New Street. In the 1970s, local services from the station came under the control of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) under whose auspices service frequencies were improved. From 1975, a regular interval half hourly service was introduced between Moor Street and and .\n\nMoor Street was originally provided with a large goods station situated adjacent to the passenger station, which opened in 1914. It was built using the increasingly rare Hennebique technique for reinforced concrete. This took many goods trains which would otherwise have passed through Snow Hill tunnel. Because it was built in a confined space on a steep gradient, the goods station was built on two levels, with one high level, and two low level sheds. Three wagon lifts were provided to transfer wagons to and from the low level sheds. The low level sheds were equipped with electric traversers to move wagons between the lifts and sidings where they would be loaded and unloaded.\n\nA major source of traffic at the goods station was fresh fruit and vegetables, which would arrive at the station in the mornings, and be taken straight to the nearby market in the Bull Ring. The goods station was finally closed on 6 November 1972, and the main high-level shed was demolished three years later. The site of the former goods station is now partly occupied by the Selfridges Building, and some of the former low-level goods sheds are now used as a car-park.\n\nIn the mid-1980s funding became available to reopen a station at Birmingham Snow Hill, along with Snow Hill tunnel. As part of the reopening scheme, a new Moor Street station with through platforms was built at the southern portal of the restored tunnel. On completion of this project, the original Moor Street terminus became redundant, and closed down. The final train, on 26 September 1987, was a steam special hauled by a locomotive from Birmingham Railway Museum, Clun Castle. The old platforms were disconnected from the network, and the new through station came into use on 5 October 1987.\n\nIn the 1990s the range of services stopping at Moor Street were expanded for the first time since it opened. In 1993, limited stop Network SouthEast services were introduced from London Marylebone to Snow Hill via Banbury and Leamington Spa, stopping at Moor Street, thus making Moor Street a main line station for the first time. This service was taken over by Chiltern Railways following privatisation. In 1995, the completion of the \"Jewellery Line\" project north of Snow Hill, meant that through services to Worcester via and Kidderminster were introduced.\n\nThe original station was not demolished but was mothballed and allowed to deteriorate. By the late 1990s, the former platforms were overgrown and dilapidated, and cracks in the wall were visible from the road side, including some caused by the impact of a runaway bus. In March 1988 the \"Moor Street Station Historical Society\" was formed to \"Save Our Station\". Dr Bernard Juby, a medical practitioner from nearby Yardley, became its Chairman and immediately set about campaigning for the station and its warehousing to be listed. Large teams of volunteers met each week-end to clean and preserve the various buildings. The existing artifacts were carefully renovated and stored and were subsequently re-used when the station reopened to the public. As a result of their efforts the old station became Grade II listed in 1998. The inspector from English Heritage visited the site in 1988 and agreed that both station and warehouses should be Listed, but it took a further 10 years and (with the help of Councillors Sir Stan Yapp and Fred Chapman) a 14,500+ signature petition to the City Council before the Secretary of State signed it off.\nIn the 2000s, the growth in services on the Snow Hill Lines again strained capacity through Snow Hill tunnel, and so Chiltern Railways and the Birmingham Alliance decided to restore the original terminus and reopen it, to allow some services to terminate there rather than Snow Hill. Between 2002 and 2003 the original Moor Street station building and platforms were renovated and restored to a 1930s style at a cost of £11 million. However, there was a long delay before the old terminal platforms were connected to the network and opened for service, because of delays in carrying out the necessary signalling work by Network Rail. Two of the three former terminal platforms, numbered 3 and 4, were reopened for use on 11 December 2010. The third bay platform 5 remains disused.\n\nThe restoration project also unified the original station and the 1980s station into one. The main 1980s station entrance was demolished, and a new passenger access was created to the through platforms using the old station's ticket hall. The footbridge and canopies on the through platforms were also rebuilt to match the style of the original station.\n\nRefurbished in 1930s style, the station has reproduction lamps, clock, seating, and signage. The renovation won the Railway Heritage Trust award for 2004 and The Birmingham Civic Society's Renaissance Award for 2005. The station became home to the cosmetically restored second GWR 2884 Class 2-8-0 No. 2885, which, until being removed on 4 June 2013, stood in the disused platform five. Further renovations during 2011–12 included the installation of GWR-inspired gilt signage on the front and side elevations of the station building.\n\nSince the December 2010 timetable change, two of the three south facing bay platforms at Moor Street station are now connected to the network and in use, enabling some of the Chiltern services to and from London Marylebone to terminate at Moor Street instead of Snow Hill. Local Chiltern stopping services to Leamington Spa will also begin and terminate at the new terminal platforms. Chiltern Railways are engaged in a large-scale redevelopment of their route from London Marylebone to Birmingham with improvements to allow higher speeds.\n\nA fast train service between Moor Street and London Marylebone was introduced on 5 September 2011 using locomotive-hauled coaches, furthering the competition with Virgin Trains' West Coast Main Line services from Birmingham New Street.\n\nMoor Street is currently served by West Midlands Railway who run local services on the Snow Hill Lines, and by Chiltern Railways who run longer distance services to London Marylebone via the Chiltern Main Line:\n\nSome of the Chiltern London services terminate at Snow Hill, calling at Moor Street's through platforms, while other services terminate at Moor Street's terminal platforms. Some of the through Chiltern services continue beyond Birmingham to during peak hours. The Chiltern service is:\n\nSix West Midlands Railway trains per hour call at Moor Street in each direction, running as follows:\n\nEastbound:\n\n\nWestbound:\n\n\nOn summer Sundays, Moor Street is used by steam locomotives running tourist specials between Snow Hill and Stratford upon Avon and trains between Snow Hill and Tyseley run by Vintage Trains.\n\nMoor Street station is 400 yards (365 metres) away from New Street station; the city's main railway station. There is a signposted route for passengers travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves a short walk through a tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre. Although the railway lines into New Street pass directly underneath Moor Street station, there is no track connection. In 2013 a new direct walkway was opened between the two stations making interchange easier.\n\nPlans are being pursued to introduce new services into Moor Street by constructing new chords linking the station to the Camp Hill Line, which is currently mostly used by freight trains. The new chords would run into Moor Street's terminus platforms, and would allow a new local passenger service south to and beyond, including new stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and Hazelwell. This would also allow for new local services into Moor Street on the lines from Birmingham to and including a new station at . The currently disused third bay platform would be reopened, and an additional new fourth bay platform would be opened to accommodate the new services.\n\nIn a West Midlands & Chiltern Routes Study it is proposed that services to the South West (via Worcester) and the East Midlands (Nottingham and Leicester) will be rerouted into Moor Street from New Street after the construction of the Camp Hill Chords.\n\nNetwork Rail have predicted that the number of passengers using Moor Street will grow to 8.9 million per year by 2023 and then to over 12 million by 2043.\n\nThe High Speed 2's Birmingham city centre terminus, Birmingham Curzon Street railway station is planned to be built adjacent to Moor Street station.\n\nIn March 2019, plans were revealed to redevelop Moor Street station which include a new footbridge to link all 6 platforms with the planned HS2 station and two new platforms (5 and 6), this is to get ready for re-routing of services from East Midlands, South West, Worcester and Hereford to Moor Street.\n\nOn the 26 June 2019, plans were submitted to the Department for Transport to get funding for the £2 billion investment programme known as the Midlands Rail Hub. Plans for Moor Street included:\n\n\n"}

The lake is one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe. At an altitude of above sea level it is the highest marl lake in the United Kingdom. Its geology, flora and fauna have led to it being listed under a number of conservation designations. The site is currently owned by the National Trust, who lease part of the site to the Field Studies Council who offer residential and non-residential field courses there. The site was the inspiration for Charles Kingsley's 1863 novel \"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\".\n\nMalham Tarn is situated in the Yorkshire Dales, a national park in the Yorkshire Pennines. It lies approximately north-west of Bradford and about north of the nearest settlement, Malham.\n\nAt above sea level it is sometimes, but erroneously, considered the highest lake in England, but there are lakes at higher altitudes such as Innominate Tarn. It is, however, the highest marl lake in Great Britain. The lake is one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe, having a pH between 8.0 and 8.6. The catchment area of the lake is and the main inflow is a stream at the lake's north-west corner. The lake is at its deepest, with an average depth of and the surface area is . It takes approximately 11 weeks for water to leave the lake after it has entered. The primary outflow is a small stream at the southern end of the lake. The outflow stream goes underground after approximately before emerging downstream of Malham Cove as a source of the River Aire.\n\nSituated in a limestone area, Malham Tarn itself mainly lies on a bed of silurian slate which is covered with marl deposits. The lake's basin was dammed by a moraine at the end of the last glacial period, approximately years ago. It used to be about twice its current size, having shrunk due to silting at the western shore; this has formed a boggy region called Tarn Moss. Following deforestation during the Iron Age, the land surrounding the lake has been used for grazing which has prevented further tree growth. An embankment and sluice gate were added to the lake in 1791 by Lord Ribblesdale; this has had the effect of raising the level of the lake by approximately . The average annual rainfall over the catchment area is .\n\nThe lake is home to six species of fish, as well as white-clawed crayfish, great crested grebes, moorhens, coots, tufted ducks and teal. A number of waders such as redshanks, curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers breed in the surrounding area. Two rare benthic copepods, \"Bryocamptus rhaeticus\" and \"Moraria mrazeki\", are found in the lake, along with 22 species of molluscs—nine of which are found at their highest altitude in Britain. The lake also contains a number of submerged aquatic plants, while the surrounding area is home to a diverse number of plants including wild cranberry, bearberry, crowberry, dark-leaved willow and purple moor grass. Last seen fifty years ago, captive-bred water voles (\"Arvicola amphibius\") were reintroduced in August 2016. This is the highest reintroduction of water vole in the UK.\n\nThe lake is located in the Malham and Arncliffe Site of Special Scientific Interest which was established in 1955. In 1992, the lake and its wetlands were designated as a National Nature Reserve. The lake was listed as a Ramsar Convention site in 1993. It is also in the Craven Limestone Complex Special Area of Conservation.\n\nThere has been human activity at Malham Tarn dating back to the Mesolithic era when the shores of the lake were used for camping during hunting trips for deer and wild cattle. During the Bronze and Iron Ages, the surrounding area was settled by farmers who used the land for grazing. Following the Roman conquest of Britain the upland areas were not seen as attractive and the only Roman presence in the area was a marching camp on Malham Moor. During the Medieval period the lands were owned by the Monasteries, and their use for grazing continued. A survey undertaken in 1539 at the time of the dissolution of Fountains Abbey makes note of a farmstead on the northern shore of lake.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the monasteries, the estates of Malham Moor then changed hands several times until they were eventually acquired by Thomas Lister—later to become the first Lord Ribblesdale—in the mid- to late-18th century. Lister then built a hunting lodge on the site of the old farm in the 1780s. The estate was then sold to businessman James Morrison in 1852. Following Morrison's death the estates were inherited by his son, Walter, in 1857. While visiting Walter Morrison in 1858, author Charles Kingsley was inspired to write the Victorian era novel \"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\". Walter Morrison died in 1921 and the estate subsequently changed hands a number times before being broken up. The house and the lake were eventually bought by Walter Morrison's great-niece, Mrs Hutton-Croft, in 1928. In 1946 Mrs Hutton-Croft presented the house to the National Trust, who manage the property and lease the house to the Field Studies Council, now called the Malham Tarn Field Studies Centre. The house exterior and the surrounding countryside can be seen in the 1951 film \"Another Man's Poison\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2159434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159434", "title": "Arator", "text": "Arator\n\nArator was a sixth-century Christian poet from Liguria in northwestern Italy. His best known work, \"De Actibus Apostolorum\", is a verse history of the Apostles.\n\nArator was probably of Ligurian origin. An orphan, he studied at Milan under the patronage of the Bishop Laurentius and of Magnus Felix Ennodius, then went to Ravenna by the advice of Parthenius, nephew of Ennodius. He took up the career of a lawyer.\n\nTreated with distinction by Theodoric on account of his oration in behalf of the Dalmatians, and protected by Cassiodorus, he entered the service of the Gothic court, but resigned at the time of the struggle with Byzantium (about 536). Pope Vigilius made him Subdeacon of the Roman Church. It was there that he wrote in hexameters two books \"De Actibus Apostolorum\", about 544. He follows the story of the Acts of the Apostles; the first book, dedicated to St. Peter, concludes with Chapter XII; the second, dedicated to St. Paul, with the martyrdom of the two Apostles. Many important events are omitted, others only alluded to.\n\nArator himself declared that his aim was to give the mystical and moral meaning of the book. Accordingly, he often gives strange interpretations of numbers and names. He endeavours to praise St. Peter at the expense of St. Paul and the other Apostles.\n\nHis style and versification are fairly correct, and he cleverly evades the entanglements of symbolism. The poem was very successful. Vigilius had the author read it in public at the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. The reading lasted four days, as the poet had to repeat many passages by request of his audience.\n\nHis works remained popular during the Middle Ages, when they became classics. We have also two addresses in distichs written by Arator to the Abbot Florianus and to Vigilius, as well as a letter to Parthenius. The latter two pieces contain biographical details.\n\nThe date of the poet's death is unknown.\n\n\n"}

The titular constable of the Castle, Sir William Douglas, had several times tried unsuccessfully to retake it. For his brave and heroic feat, Sir Alexander was appointed constable of Roxburgh and Sheriff of Teviotdale. Sir William Douglas was so outraged by the appointments, that he sought revenge by capturing Sir Alexander and imprisoning him in the dungeon of Hermitage Castle where he was left to starve.

Samuel L. Jackson served as a producer, and starred in the film with Lisa Nicole Carson, Jurnee Smollett, Lynn Whitfield, Debbi Morgan, Meagan Good and Diahann Carroll.\n\nIn 2018, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nEve Batiste (Jurnee Smollett), a 10-year-old girl, lives in a prosperous Creole-American community in Louisiana with her younger brother Poe (Jake Smollett) and her older sister Cisely (Meagan Good) in the 1960s. Their parents are Roz (Lynn Whitfield) and Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), a well-respected doctor in Louisiana's \"colored\" community who claims descent from the French aristocrat who founded the town of Eve's Bayou. One night after a raucous party, Eve accidentally witnesses her father having sex with Matty Mereaux (Lisa Nicole Carson), a family friend. However, Cisely, who has a very affectionate relationship with her father, convinces Eve that she misinterpreted an innocent moment. The unreliability of memory and observation remain important themes throughout the film.\n\nThe summer quickly becomes a chaotic and stressful one for the Batiste family. Eve's relationship with her parents becomes more strained as she discovers more evidence of her father's serial infidelity. Cisely comes into conflict with both her sister and mother as she enters puberty and tries to navigate the difficult transition to adulthood, particularly with regard to her appearance and sexuality. Roz eventually begins to suspect her husband's infidelity, prompting conflict between the two as well.\n\nDuring the chaotic summer, Eve often seeks refuge with her Aunt Mozelle (Debbi Morgan) who works as a \"psychic counselor\" and has had three husbands who all died violently; the most recent having died in a car crash. Eve, who has a premonitory dream shortly before the accident occurs, is told by Mozelle that the gift of second sight runs in their family. Mozelle's gift also brings her into direct conflict with Elzora (Diahann Carroll), a fortune teller and possible witch with similar abilities. When asked for a reading by Roz, Elzora implies that an unexpected \"solution\" to her problem will arise, but to wait and look to her children in the meantime. When Mozelle grudgingly makes a similar request, Elzora cruelly tells her that she is a \"black widow,\" whose future husbands will suffer the same fate as her previous ones. Meanwhile, Eve, frustrated by her father's infidelity, begins to act out, bringing her into conflict with the other members of her family. Cisely begins to behave strangely as well, isolating herself from the family after experiencing her first period.\n\nCisely later confides in Eve the secret behind her strange mood. She tells her that one night, after their parents had a vicious argument, Cisely went to comfort her father and he, while drunk, attempted to molest her. Enraged, Eve seeks out Elzora to commission a voodoo spell to put a fatal curse on her father. While on her way to visit the witch, Eve runs into Lenny Mereaux (Roger Guenveur Smith) and questions him about his teaching job that keeps him away from home. In the conversation, she alludes to a possible tryst between his wife, Matty, and her father.\n\nEve is under the impression that she is going to receive a voodoo doll of her father. When returning to the witch to get her doll, she is informed that there is no doll and that, per her request, a curse has been placed on her father. In an attempt to save him, Eve rushes to bring her father home, finding him in a bar chatting with Matty Mereaux. At the same time, a drunken Lenny arrives to take Matty home. After a confrontation, Lenny and Matty leave the bar, and Lenny tells Louis that he will kill him if he talks to Matty again. After Louis says goodbye to Matty, Lenny shoots and kills Louis.\n\nAfter her father's funeral, Eve soon finds a letter which her father wrote to Mozelle, disputing the accusations. In it, he claims that Cisely had come to him that night and kissed him, first as a daughter and then as a lover. In his drunken state, he reacted violently, slapping her and pushing her to the ground, which made her angry with him. Eve confronts Cisely and uses her second sight to discover what really happened. It ends with the sisters holding hands, gazing at the sunset.\n\n\nThe film received positive reviews, with \"Chicago Sun-Times\" Roger Ebert naming it the best film of 1997. CNN's Paul Tatara, \"Empire, Entertainment Weekly, The Hollywood Reporter, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Observer, The New York Times, TIME, Variety\", and \"The Washington Post\" also loudly praised the film and its performances.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Eve's Bayou marks a striking feature debut for director Kasi Lemmons, layering terrific performances and Southern mysticism into a measured meditation on disillusionment and forgiveness.\" The film did receive many accolades. Debbi Morgan's performance would be her most honored film role, with four nominations and two wins. The film is also noted for Jurnee Smollett's performance; up to this point, she had worked primarily as a TV actress, with \"Jack\" as her only previous film.\n\nIn February 2008, \"Eve's Bayou\" made \"TIME\"'s list of \"The 25 Most Important Films on Race\".\n\nOn February 16, 2009, Debbi Morgan's portrayal of Mozelle Batiste Delacroix was included in Pop Matters' 100 Essential Female Film Performances list.\n\nIn 2012, Jurnee Smollett's role as Eve Batiste was included in Essence Magazine's 25 Best Roles for Black Actresses list.\n\n1997 Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards\n\n1997 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards\n\n1997 National Board of Review Awards\n\n1997 San Diego Film Critics Society Awards\n\n1998 Acapulco Black Film Festival\n\n1998 Independent Spirit Awards\n\n1998 NAACP Image Awards\n\n1998 Satellite Awards\n\n1998 Young Artist Awards\n\n1998 YoungStar Awards\n\n"}

Since 1986, the syndicated version has been adapted into various video games spanning numerous hardware generations. Most versions released in the 20th century were published by GameTek, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1998.\n\nAn Atari 2600 adaptation of \"Wheel of Fortune\" was planned by The Great Game Co. in 1983, but ended up being cancelled during development. In 1987 the first of GameTek's many \"Wheel\" games was published, with Sharedata as its developer; this version was released simultaneously on the Commodore 64 and the Nintendo Entertainment System, and subsequently spawned a second Commodore 64 version of \"Wheel\" from Sharedata, as well as a \"Family Edition\" and a \"Junior Edition\", both of which were exclusive to the NES and were developed by Rare Neither host Pat Sajak nor hostess Vanna White is featured in any of these games; however, White is featured in a later NES game from GameTek and IJE Inc., which was released in 1992 and also appeared on the Sega Genesis, Super NES, and the Game Gear. The magazine \"Mega\" gave the Super NES and Genesis versions a score of 22%, saying that there was \"no challenge\". A \"Deluxe Edition\" was also released for the Super NES in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Sony Imagesoft released a game based on \"Wheel\" for the Sega CD. \"Next Generation\" rated it two stars out of five, and stated that \"Even as a party game, \"Wheel of Fortune\" doesn't cut it.\" Two years later, GameTek made plans to create adaptations for the Sega Saturn and the 3DO, but both were canceled during development.\n\nIn mid-1997, Take-Two Interactive acquired GameTek's assets, including the rights to develop \"Wheel of Fortune\" games for the Nintendo 64. On December 2, 1997, Take-Two Interactive released its first \"Wheel\" game for the Nintendo 64; this was Take-Two's last collaboration with GameTek. The Sega CD and N64 versions of \"Wheel\" both feature full-motion video footage of White as host. Reviews generally stated that the N64 version did not hold up well to other N64 games but did a decent job of recreating the show, particularly the camera movements and the 3D studio. However, they derided the unnatural-sounding voices of the contestants and the animations of Vanna White walking in front of the puzzles (without touching the panels when they light up). The game received a score of 6.4 out of 10 from IGN and 5.125 out of 10 from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\".\n\nArtech Studios and Hasbro Interactive produced a video game adaptation of \"Wheel\" for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation console on December 15, 1998; this version again features White appearing as host via FMV sequences, and a 3-D engine that allows it to have a presentation similar to that of the actual show. This particular version is compatible with a memory card which allows it to avoid previously played puzzles until the entire library has been played through. On September 12, 2000, Hasbro released a second PlayStation version of \"Wheel\", which features a behind-the-scenes interview with White and a qualifying exam for contestant hopefuls. After this, Atari, Inc. released a PlayStation 2 edition in November 2003. On March 19, 2009, Sony Online Entertainment released a version of the show for the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Network; Chris Roper of IGN gave that version a 5.8 out of 10, saying that it felt \"empty and lifeless\" for not featuring any host or hostess or any voice work whatsoever, and also criticized the graphic quality, saying that the game was \"not fully polished\".\n\nOn November 2, 2010, THQ released video games based on \"Wheel of Fortune\" for Nintendo's Wii console. This set of games is the first to feature Sajak as well as White as well as the last to feature announce Charlie O'Donnell. Another Wii game would be released 4 years later by Nordic Games. In 2012 THQ-published versions developed by Pipeworks Software appeared for the PlayStation 3, the Wii U, and Microsoft's Xbox 360.\n\nOn November 7, 2017, Ubisoft released video games based on \"Wheel of Fortune\" for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game comes in digital download as well as a bundle retail version with \"Jeopardy!\". This version of \"Wheel of Fortune\" features Classic and Quick modes, as well as online multiplayer options like leaderboards and voice chat. It includes over 4,000 puzzles and a leveling system that enables players to unlock 250 new customization items that can be used on contestants or the studio set. This version was later released for Nintendo Switch.\n\nIn 1988, Mattel created a \"Wheel of Fortune\" game that allowed playing along with the TV show. At that time, the show would include encoded data at the beginning of each round, seen as flickering in the TV picture, that the Mattel machine could \"download\" to receive the puzzle and timing information for when letters were revealed in the puzzle. The game allowed players to \"spin\" and guess letters in the puzzle, buy vowels, and solve the puzzle. If a contestant on the TV show solved the puzzle before a person playing the Mattel machine solved it, the machine would reveal the puzzle and terminate the round.\n\nIn 1990, GameTek created a \"Wheel of Fortune\" game for the Game Boy. Then in 1997, Tiger Electronics released two adaptations of the show for its Game.com system, which allows players to use the console's touchscreen to select letters. Additionally, Majesco Entertainment once planned a \"Wheel\" adaptation of its own for the Game Boy Color but that was cancelled. On November 2, 2010, THQ published a Nintendo DS \"Wheel of Fortune\" video game developed by Griptonite Games, which allows players to customize and name their player character.\n\nAdditionally, a number of \"Wheel\" games have been released for mobile telephones. On May 2, 2005, InfoSpace's \"Atlas Mobile\" studio created a tournament-style game based on the show as part of its \"For Prizes\" lineup of games allowing players to win free gift certificates; this game is set to a time limit of five minutes and requires players to complete the regular rounds in five turns or less apiece. Subsequent mobile phone incarnations of the show were released by Sony Pictures Mobile in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.\n\n\"Wheel of Fortune\" has also been adapted for personal computers. From 1987 through 1990, GameTek created five \"Wheel of Fortune\" computer games for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. On November 15, 1998, Hasbro Interactive released a PC version of its own, where Vanna White is joined by the then-current \"Wheel\" announcer, Charlie O'Donnell (but not Pat Sajak). In 2000 a port for Macintosh was made, released by MacSoft That same year, Hasbro released a second PC version of \"Wheel\", which like the aforementioned PlayStation equivalent features a behind-the-scenes interview and a qualifying exam. Atari's 2003 follow-up also saw a PC version of its own.\n\nIn 2007 Sony Online Entertainment produced a PC version of the show titled \"Wheel of Fortune Deluxe\", sharing publishing duties with Encore, Inc. Encore followed that up with a \"Super Deluxe\" version of the game in 2008.\n\nSony Pictures Digital and Game Show Network's interactive division released a free \"Wheel of Fortune\" game on Facebook. It combined most aspects of the TV game show and allowed players to become contestants competing for virtual currency, called \"Wheel Bucks,\" by playing a \"Main Round\" puzzle on their own and a \"Bonus Round\" puzzle allowing them to collaborate with their Facebook friends to increase their winnings. The game was later moved to GSN's \"Games by GSN Casino\" with better graphics, faster load times, the ability to amass collections and win trophies, and a full-screen mode, but eventually the game was taken down. The \"Games by GSN Casino\" has also featured a \"Wheel of Fortune Slots\" game that abides by the basic rules of slots games but incorporates aspects of the actual show in various ways, such as featuring a bonus game where players can spin the Wheel to increase their earnings; this is the only one of \"Wheel\"s many slots games not to be manufactured by International Game Technology. Neither game features Sajak nor White, and both games support only one player.\n\nA \"Wheel of Fortune\" pinball machine was released in the fall of 2007 and was developed by Stern Pinball. It was designed by Kevin O'Connor and Margaret Hudson, and features the voices of Sajak and O'Donnell. Although White does appear with Sajak on the marquee, her voice is never heard in the game.\n\n"}

The dam also has two, 4.5 MW turbines which generate electricity that is fed into the Xcel Energy power grid.\n\nThe original dam at this location dated from 1887, and ownership was transferred from Northern States Power to the city of St. Cloud in 1967. During reconstruction of the dam in 1970, a cofferdam was built upstream from the construction site to hold back Mississippi River waters. Due to a structural inadequacy, the cofferdam washed out on October 31, 1970. The energy of the impounded water caused extensive damage to the construction site and downstream areas.\n\nThe current dam was retrofitted to produce hydroelectric power, and is used by various hydrology classes at the adjacent St. Cloud State University to demonstrate hydrodynamic properties and to show how power is converted into electricity. It produces 8.5 megawatts and is the largest city-owned hydroelectric facility in the state.\n\nThe dam is located just south of University Drive SE, both connecting the Stearns County section of St. Cloud to the Sherburne County section.\n\n"}

{"id": "2159451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2159451", "title": "Loop antenna", "text": "Loop antenna\n\nA loop antenna is a radio antenna consisting of a loop or coil of wire, tubing, or other electrical conductor usually fed by a balanced source or feeding a balanced load. Within this physical description there are two distinct antenna types:\n\nThe large self-resonant loop antenna has a circumference close to one wavelength of the operating frequency and so is resonant at that frequency. These antennas are used for both transmission and reception. Resonant loop antennas have a two-lobe radiation pattern; they are most sensitive to radio waves in two broad lobes in opposite directions, 180° apart.\n\nSmall loop antennas have a small circumference compared to the operating wavelength. They may be used for transmission and reception, although antennas that are very small compared to the wavelength are very inefficient radiators, and so are only used for reception. An example is the ferrite (loopstick) antenna used in most AM broadcast radios. The radiation pattern of a small loop antenna has two sharp nulls in opposite directions. Due to this directional pattern, small loops are used for radio direction finding (RDF), to locate the position of a transmitter.\n\nSelf resonant loop antennas are relatively large, governed by the intended wavelength of operation. They are mainly used at frequencies above 3.5 MHz where their size is feasible. They can be viewed as a folded dipole split into an open shape, just as a folded dipole is a full-sized loop, bent at two ends and squashed into a line. The loop's shape can be a circle, triangle, square, rectangle, or in fact any closed polygon; the only strict requirement is that its perimeter must be (slightly over) one full-wavelength.\n\nThe maximum radiation for a 1 wavelength loop is at right angles to the plane of the loop (See pattern below). At the lower shortwave frequencies a full loop is physically quite large, and for practical reasons must be installed \"lying flat\", that is the plane of the loop horizontal to the ground, its wires supported at the same height by masts at its several corners. The main beam is upwards. Above 10 MHz, the loop is more frequently \"standing up\", that is with the plane of the loop vertical, in order to direct its main beam towards the horizon. If feasible, a vertical loop may be rotatable, in order to control the direction of the strongest signal. Compared to a dipole or folded dipole, it transmits slightly less toward the sky or ground, giving it about 1.5 dB higher gain in the two favored horizontal directions. \nAdditional gain (and a uni-directional radiation pattern) is usually obtained with an array of such elements either as a driven endfire array or in a Yagi configuration (with all but one loop being parasitic elements). The latter is widely used in amateur radio where it is referred to as a quad antenna (see photo).\n\nLoop antennas may be in the shape of a circle, a square or any other closed geometric shape that allows the total perimeter to be one wavelength. The most popular shape in amateur radio is the quad antenna or \"quad\" (quadrilateral) consists of a resonant loop in a square shape so that it can be constructed of wire strung across a supporting ‘X’ frame. Usually there are other, additional loops stacked parallel to the first as parasitic elements, that make the composite antenna directional. Other \"quads\" rotate this 45 degrees to a diamond shape supported on a ‘+’ frame. Triangular loops have also been used. A rectangle twice as high as its width gives a bit more gain than the square loop and also matches 50 ohms directly if used without a reflector.\n\nThe polarization of such an antenna is not obvious by looking at the loop itself, but depends on the feed point (where the transmission line is connected), and whether it is being operated as a 1, 2, or 3 wavelength loop. If a vertically oriented loop is fed at the bottom at its 1 wavelength frequency, it will be horizontally polarized; feeding it from the side will make it vertically polarized.\n\nIn all of the large loops described above, the antenna's operating frequency is assumed to be at its first resonance, whose corresponding wavelength almost matches the circumference of the loop. Wire size and type of insulation will cause minor shifts in the resonant frequency. Other loop antenna resonances exist near frequencies where the perimeter is 2 wavelengths, 3 wavelengths, etc., with very different radiation patterns.\n\nLow frequency one wavelength loops are sometimes used on higher frequencies where the circumference will be several whole wavelengths. There may be some resonances which may not fall on legally usable frequencies; in cases where the higher resonant frequencies can be used, the feedpoint impedance will also be very different, so operation will require use of an antenna tuner, preferably with a low loss transmission line. Radiation patterns at higher resonances are very different: Most noticeably the maximum radiation is in the plane of the loop, like a small loop (see below), instead of being perpendicular to it.\n\nSmall loops are “small” in comparison to their operating wavelength, typically between 5% and 30% of a wavelength in circumference, with transmitting loops tending to be closer to 30%. As with all antennas, smaller antennas are less efficient radiators than larger antennas. However, small loops become practical at lower frequencies where wavelengths are tens to hundreds of meters long, or greater, and full-size loops (the most efficient) and half-wave straight-wire antennas (next-most efficient) become infeasibly large.\nA common distinguishing feature of small loops is that their direction of maximum transmission or reception is within the plane of the loop – the opposite of large loops, whose maximum is perpendicular to the plane. In the direction that large loops produce their strongest signals in both transmit and receive, small loops have a null in their pattern. \n\nCarefully designed and built small loops have advantages for reception on frequencies below 10 MHz. Although a small loop's losses can be high, the receiving signal-to-noise ratio may not suffer if the loop's diameter is at least 1 or 2 meters, regardless of frequency. The very high Q rejects off-frequency interference and overload but also dictates that the loop must be carefully tuned to the exact operating frequency. The ability to rotate may help reject either local noise or distant interference, by orienting the “deaf” side of the loop towards the unwanted interference.\n\nSmall transmitting loops are “small” in comparison to a full-wave loop, but considerably larger than the small receiving loop, and unlike receiving loops must be “scaled-up” for longer wavelengths. They are typically used on frequencies between 3–30 MHz. They usually consist of a single turn of large diameter conductor, and are typically round or octagonal to provide maximum enclosed area for a given perimeter. The smaller of these loops are much less efficient than full-sized self-resonant loops, but where space is at a premium the smaller loops can provide effective communications. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build.\n\nA small transmitting loop antenna, also known as a magnetic loop, with a circumference 10% of a wavelength or less, will have a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor, and the main lobe will be in the plane of the loop. Loops of any size between 10% and 100% of a wavelength in circumference can be built and tuned to resonance with series reactance. A capacitor is required for a circumference less than a half wave, an inductor for loops more than a half wave and less than a full wave. Loops in this size range may have neither the uniform current of the small loop, nor the double peaked current of the full sized loop and thus cannot be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small receiving loops nor the self resonant loop antennas. Performance is best determined with NEC analysis. Antennas within this size range include the halo (see below) and the G0CWT (Edginton) loop.\n\nAll small transmitting loops work even better for receiving.\n\nIn addition to other common impedance matching techniques such as a gamma match, transmitting loops are sometimes impedance matched by connecting the feedline to a smaller \"feed loop\" inside the area surrounded by the main loop. Typical feed loops are to the size of the antenna's main loop. The combination is in effect a transformer, with power in the near-field inductively coupled from the feed loop to the main loop, which itself is connected to the resonating capacitor and is responsible for radiating most of the power.\n\nSmall loops are used in land-mobile radio (mostly military) at frequencies between 3–7 MHz, because of their ability to direct energy upwards, unlike a conventional whip antenna. This enables Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication up to 300 km in mountainous regions. In this case a typical radiation efficiency of around 1% is acceptable because signal paths can be established with 1 Watt of radiated power or less when a transmitter generating 100 Watts is used.\n\nIn military use, the antenna may be built using a one or two conductors 1–2 inches in diameter. The loop itself is typically 6 feet in diameter.\n\nOne practical issue with small loops as transmitting antennas is that the loop not only has a very large current going through it, but also has a very high voltage across the capacitor, typically thousands of Volts when fed with only a few Watts of transmitter power. This requires a rather expensive and physically large resonating capacitor with a large breakdown voltage, in addition to having minimal dielectric loss (normally requiring an air-gap capacitor). In addition to making the geometric loop larger, efficiency may be increased by using larger conductors or other measures to reduce the conductor's loss resistance. However, lower loss means higher Q and even greater voltage on the capacitor. \n\nThis problem is more serious than with a vertical or dipole antenna that is short compared to a wavelength. There matching using a loading coil also generates a high voltage at the antenna end(s). However, unlike with capacitors, the voltage across a physically large inductor is generally not an issue.\n\nIf the perimeter of a loop antenna is much smaller than the wavelengths intended – say to of a wavelength – then the antenna is a \"small loop antenna\". Several performance factors, including received power, scale in proportion to loop area. For a given loop area, the length of the conductor (and thus its net loss resistance) is minimized if the perimeter is circular, making a circle the optimal shape for small loops. Small receiving loops are typically used below 3 MHz where human-made and natural atmospheric noise dominate. Thus the signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal will not be adversely affected by low efficiency as long as the loop is not excessively small.\n\nA typical diameter of receiving loops with \"air centers\" is between 30 cm and 1 meter. To increase the magnetic field in the loop and thus its efficiency, while greatly reducing size, the coil of wire is often wound around a ferrite rod magnetic core; this is called a \"ferrite loop\" antenna. Such ferrite loop antennas are used in almost all AM broadcast receivers with the exception of car radios; the antenna is then usually contained inside the radio's chassis. These antennas are also used for radio direction finding.\n\nThe radiation resistance of a small loop is generally much smaller than the loss resistance due to the conductors composing the loop, leading to a poor antenna efficiency. Consequently, most of the power delivered to a small loop antenna will be converted to heat by the loss resistance, rather than doing useful work.\n\nSo much wasted power is not acceptable in a transmitting antenna, however in a receiving antenna the inefficiency is not important at frequencies below about 15 MHz. At these lower frequencies, atmospheric noise (static) and man-made noise (radio frequency interference) even in the weak signal from an inefficient antenna are far above the internal \"thermal\" or \"Johnson noise\" present in the radio receiver's circuits, so the weak signal from a loop antenna can be amplified without degrading the signal-to-noise ratio. (CCIR 258; CCIR 322.)\n\nFor example, at 1 MHz the man-made noise might be 55 dB above the thermal noise floor. If a small loop antenna's loss is 50 dB (as if the antenna included a 50 dB attenuator) the electrical inefficiency of that antenna will have little influence on the receiving system's signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nIn contrast, at quieter frequencies at about 20 MHz and above, an antenna with a 50 dB loss could degrade the received signal-to-noise ratio by up to 50 dB, resulting in terrible performance. \n\nThe small loop antenna is known as a \"magnetic loop\" since it behaves electrically as a coil (inductor). It couples to the magnetic field of the radio wave in the region near the antenna, in contrast to monopole and dipole antennas which couple to the electric field of the wave. In a receiving antenna (the main application of small loops) the oscillating magnetic field of the incoming radio wave induces a current in the wire winding by Faraday's law of induction.\n\nSurprisingly, the radiation and receiving pattern of a small loop is quite opposite that of a large self resonant loop (whose circumference is close to one wavelength). Since the loop is much smaller than a wavelength, the current at any one moment is nearly constant round the circumference. By symmetry it can be seen that the voltages induced in the loop windings along the plane of the loop, will cancel each other when a perpendicular signal arrives on the loop axis. Therefore, there is a \"null\" in that direction. Instead, the radiation pattern peaks in directions lying in the plane of the loop, because signals received from sources in that plane do not quite cancel owing to the phase difference between the arrival of the wave at the near side and far side of the loop. Increasing that phase difference by increasing the size of the loop has a large impact in increasing the radiation resistance and the resulting antenna efficiency.\n\nAnother way of looking at a small loop as an antenna is to consider it simply as an inductive coil coupling to the magnetic field in the direction \"perpendicular\" to plane of the coil, according to Ampère's law. Then consider a propagating radio wave also perpendicular to that plane. Since the magnetic (and electric) fields of an electromagnetic wave in free space are transverse (no component in the direction of propagation), it can be seen that this magnetic field and that of a small loop antenna will be at right angles, and thus not coupled. For the same reason, an electromagnetic wave propagating within the plane of the loop, with its magnetic field perpendicular to that plane, \"is\" coupled to the magnetic field of the coil. Since the transverse magnetic and electric fields of a propagating electromagnetic wave are at right angles, the electric field of such a wave is also in the plane of the loop, and thus the antenna's \"polarization\" (which is always specified as being the orientation of the electric, not the magnetic field) is said to be in that plane.\n\nThus mounting the loop in a horizontal plane will produce an omnidirectional antenna which is horizontally polarized; mounting the loop vertically yields a weakly directional antenna with vertical polarization and sharp nulls along the axis of the loop.\n\nSince a small loop antenna is essentially a coil, its electrical impedance is inductive, with an inductive reactance much greater than its radiation resistance. In order to couple to a transmitter or receiver, the inductive reactance is normally canceled with a parallel capacitance. Since a good loop antenna will have a high Q factor, this capacitor must be variable and is adjusted along with the receiver's tuning.\n\nSmall loop receiving antennas are also almost always resonated using a parallel plate capacitor, which makes their reception narrow-band, sensitive only to a very specific frequency. This allows the antenna, in conjunction with a (variable) tuning capacitor, to act as a tuned input stage to the receiver's front-end, in lieu of a preselector.\n\nDue to its direct coupling to the magnetic field, unlike most other antenna types, the small loop is relatively insensitive to electric-field noise from nearby sources. No matter how close the electrical interference is to the loop, its effect will not be much greater than if it were a quarter wavelength away. This is valuable since most sources of interference with radio frequency content, such as sparking at commutators or corona discharge, directly produce electric fields in the near-field (much less than a wavelength from the source). Since it is in the AM broadcast band and lower frequencies generally where these small loops are used, the near field region is physically quite large (on the order of 30 m, or 100 feet). This provides a considerable advantage for using an antenna which is relatively insensitive to the main interference sources encountered in that frequency range.\n\nThe same principle makes a small loop particularly sensitive to sources of \"magnetic\" noise in its near field. Likewise, a Hertzian (short) dipole couples directly with the electric field and is relatively immune to locally produced magnetic noise. However at radio frequencies nearby sources of magnetic interference are generally not an issue. In either case the small antenna's immunity does not extend to noise sources outside of the near field: Noise sources over one wavelength distant, whether originating as an electric or magnetic field, are received simply as electromagnetic waves. Noise from outside any antenna's near field will be received equally well by any antenna sensitive to a radio transmitter from the direction of that noise source.\n\nSince the directional response of small loop antennas includes a sharp null in the direction normal to the plane of the loop, they are used in radio direction finding at longer wavelengths.\n\nThe procedure is to rotate the loop antenna to find the direction where the signal vanishes – the “null” direction. Since the null occurs at two opposite directions along the axis of the loop, other means must be employed to determine which side of the antenna the “nulled” signal is on. One method is to rely on a second loop antenna located at a second location, or to move the receiver to that other location, thus relying on triangulation.\n\nInstead of triangulation, a second dipole or vertical antenna can be electrically combined with a loop or a loopstick antenna. Called a \"sense antenna\", connecting and matching the second antenna changes the combined radiation pattern to a cardioid, with a null in only one (less precise) direction. The general direction of the transmitter can be determined using the sense antenna, and then disconnecting the sense antenna returns the sharp nulls in the loop antenna pattern, allowing a precise bearing to be determined.\n\nSmall loop antennas are lossy and inefficient for transmitting, but they can be practical receiving antennas for frequencies below 10 MHz. Especially in the mediumwave (520–1610 kHz) band and below, where wavelength-sized antennas are infeasibly large, and the antenna inefficiency is irrelevant, due to large amounts of atmospheric noise.\n\nAM broadcast receivers (and other low frequency radios for the consumer market) typically use small loop antennas, even when a telescoping antenna may be attached for FM reception. A variable capacitor connected across the loop forms a resonant circuit that also tunes the receiver's input stage as that capacitor tracks the main tuning. A multiband receiver may contain tap points along the loop winding in order to tune the loop antenna at widely different frequencies.\n\nIn AM radios built prior to the discovery of ferrite in the mid-20th century, the antenna might consist of dozens of turns of wire mounted on the back wall of the radio – a \"planar helical antenna\" – or a separate, rotatable, furniture-sized rack looped with wire – a \"frame antenna\".\n\nFerrite loop antennas are made by winding fine wire around a ferrite rod. They are almost universally used in AM broadcast receivers. Other names for this type of antenna are \"loopstick\", \"ferrite rod\" antenna or aerial, \"ferroceptor\", or \"ferrod antenna\". Often at shortwave frequencies Litz wire is used for the winding to reduce skin effect losses. Elaborate “basket weave” patterns are used at all frequencies to reduce self-capacitance in the coil and raise the loop self-resonance above the operating frequency, consequently improving the loop Q factor.\n\nThe ferrite increases the magnetic permeability and acts as a low loss magnetic conductor – much better than air. This greater conductance channels thousands of times more magnetic power through the rod, and hence through the loop, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area.\n\nSome antennas look very much like loops, but are either not continuous loops, or are designed to couple with the inductive near-field – over distances of a meter or two – rather than to transmit or receive long-distance electromagnetic waves in the radiative far-field.\n\nAlthough it has a superficially similar appearance, the so-called halo antenna is not technically a loop since it possesses a break in the conductor opposite the feed point; that totally changes the current pattern since the voltages across the break are opposite and large. It is better analyzed as a dipole (which also has a large voltage and zero current at the ends) which has been bent into a circle.\n\nStrictly speaking, RFID tags and readers interact by induction rather than transmission waves, and so are not antennas. The use of coupling coils for inductive (magnetic) transmission systems including LF and HF (rather than UHF) is outside the scope of this article.\n\nThese systems do operate at radio frequencies, and do involve the use of small loops which are called \"antennas\" in the trade. Although these small loops are sometimes indistinguishable from the small loop antennas discussed here, such systems are not designed to transmit or receive signal waves (electromagnetic waves), and can only operate over short distances. They are near field systems involving alternating magnetic fields, and may be analyzed as poorly coupled transformer windings; their performance criteria are dissimilar to radio antennas as discussed here.\n\n"}

Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, to find Flight Engineer Julio dead, First Officer Urias gone and Captain Stacy injured. Although severely injured and blinded, he is still alive. Using the last of his strength, Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness.\n\nPryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane.

The jet is heading into the Wasatch Mountains, so Murdock starts to guide Pryor by radio on how to perform the turn when radio communications are interrupted and the Salt Lake tower is unable to restore contact.\nUnable to turn, leaking fuel and dodging the peaks of the Wasatch Mountains, an air-to-air rescue attempt is undertaken from a HH-53 helicopter flown by the US Air Force Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service. While a replacement pilot is preparing to be released on a tether from the helicopter to Columbia 409, Captain Stacy is able to give a cryptic clue regarding the decrease in airspeed during a climb in altitude. Pryor realizes that she must accelerate to be able to climb over the mountain and successfully does so. After Columbia 409 has leveled off, the replacement pilot is released towards the stricken airliner. Just as Pryor is helping him in, the release cord from his harness becomes caught in the jagged metal surrounding the hole in the cockpit. As he climbs in, his harness is released from the tether and he falls from the aircraft.\n\nThe only other person on the helicopter who can land a 747 is Captain Murdock. He is tethered to the helicopter, lowered to the jet and successfully enters it through the hole in the cockpit. He then lands the plane safely at Salt Lake City Airport. However, when he does land he is forced to taxi the plane around the airport as it does not stop right away. The flight attendants successfully conduct an emergency evacuation of the passengers via the inflatable slides as Pryor and Murdock reconcile.\n\n\"Airport 1975\" used a Boeing 747-123 (s/n 20390. Registration N9675), rented from American Airlines when it was temporarily taken out of passenger service at the start of American's restructuring away from the fleet of Boeing jumbo jets in mid-1974. The aircraft was leased to Trans Mediterranean Airways briefly in 1976, before returning and being converted into an \"American Freighter\" variant. In 1984, the aircraft was sold to UPS, where it continued to serve as a freighter for over 20 years before being retired to desert storage in 2005 (and scrapped in 2011).\n\nThe film was shot on location in the Salt Lake International Airport. Aerials shots over Heber City, Utah and the Wasatch Mountains are included.\n\nAs Sister Ruth, Helen Reddy performs a solo acoustic version of her song \"Best Friend\" (originally on her 1971 debut album \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\") to an ailing Linda Blair. The song was written by Reddy and Ray Burton, who also co-wrote her hit single \"I Am Woman\".\n\n\"Airport 1975\" was a massive commercial success. With a budget of $3 million, the film grossed over $47 million in the United States and Canada at the box office, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 1974 and the year's third highest-grossing disaster film, behind \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"Earthquake\". The gross generated a theatrical rental to Universal of $25 million and worldwide, it earned rentals of $50 million.\n\nCritical reception was mainly unfavorable with \"The New Yorker\" magazine's film critic Pauline Kael calling the picture \"cut-rate swill\", \"produced on a TV-movie budget by mercenary businessmen\". Kael also thought the audio problems gave Karen Black's voice a metallic sound that was grating and that the main character, a stewardess, was constantly being patronized by men. Roger Ebert was less condemnatory, awarding two-and-a-half stars out of four and describing it as \"corny escapism\", although he made a similar observation about Black's character - that she is made to seem incompetent simply because she is a woman. Gene Siskel also gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the collision scene \"both a surprise and well executed,\" but the scenes afterward \"both implausible and dull.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"silly\" and suffering from \"a total lack of awareness of how comic it is when it's attempting to be most serious.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote \"Whatever its flaws, 'Airport' generated plenty of suspense and was lots of fun; 'Airport 1975' is too much a rehash to seem anything but mechanical and finally silly in its predictability.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" stated \"It may get by at the box-office, but it's a hasty, superfluous job of formula moviemaking.\" David McGillivray of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that \"despite a sterling performance from Karen Black, convincingly petrified as the stewardess expected to negotiate the plane through the mountains, the tension never coalesces.\" \"Airport 1975\" currently holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews.\n\n\"Airport 1975\" was included in the book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\" published in 1978. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John J.B. Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\n\nThis is one among many of a class of disaster films that became a popular craze during the 1970s. Its plot devices and characterizations, including a singing nun (Helen Reddy), a former glamorous star (Gloria Swanson as herself), an alcoholic (Myrna Loy), a child in need of an organ transplant (Linda Blair) and a chatterbox (Sid Caesar) were parodied in 1980's \"Airplane!\" and on \"The Carol Burnett Show\" as \"Disaster '75\".\n\n\n"}

He was born in Littlefield, Texas but his family moved to Lubbock soon after. He attended Texas Tech University where he drew cartoons for \"The University Daily\" student newspaper. He appeared as \"Uncle Dirk\" on a local children's program for three years while heading up his advertising agency, West Advertising. Beginning in the 1960s, he cartooned for the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\".\n\nWest's most famous works featured caricatures of the sports mascots of various universities, mostly those of the Southwest Conference (and later the Big 12 Conference), but other schools appeared as well, usually because they were playing Texas Tech. His cartoons appeared in program books, on posters, and in magazines.\n\nTwo of his characters would eventually be officially adopted by their respective universities: Texas Tech's Raider Red and the University of Nebraska's Herbie Husker.\n\nWest drew a semi-weekly one-panel comic in the \"Avalanche-Journal\"'s sports section where he would lampoon college mascots and coaches alike, as well as the stereotypes of various universities. Thus there was the dim-witted Texas A&M Aggie, the devout but overemotional Baylor Bear, the arrogant University of Texas at Austin Longhorn and of course Raider Red, whose bullet-riddled Stetson showed by the number of holes the number of game losses for Texas Tech so far that season.\n\nWest would alter the image of his characters over the course of a sports season. A winning team's mascot would gradually get larger and tougher, the fans of losing teams would find their mascots growing thinner as the weeks went by.\n\nAfter serving several years on the local Parks and Recreation Board and the city council, West was elected mayor of Lubbock in 1978, but disliked politics so much as a result that he did not run for a second term (his single term ran from 1978-1980). He returned to his advertising agency and his cartooning, both of which he kept up until his death from a heart attack in 1996.\n\nAn exhibition dedicated to West and his work opened September 25, 2005, at the Museum of Texas Tech University.

While most students come from Papua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations such as Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, others have come from Africa, Australia, Pakistan, China, the Philippines, and the United States.\n\nIt is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.\n\nThe campus is also known as a bird sanctuary. One species of bird at the campus is unique to this area of the world. Mike Tarburton, who is also known as the \"bird man\" had stayed there and carefully monitored the bird life. He has now transferred to Australia for retirement, and his work has been taken up by his students. The campus is often visited by bird watchers from all over the world.\n\nThe university is also home to the Koiari Park Adventist Church, the services of which are conducted in English.

It arose out of the recognition that up to 2002, States and Territory maternity lobby groups had worked independently for change, but until they were united in seeking the same outcomes, the Federal and State Governments would not change funding methods.\n\nThe Plan was launched on 24 September 2002 simultaneously in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth.

The NMAP outlines the rationale behind the need for major reform of maternity services, and, proposes a strategy for Federal and State/Territory governments to enable comprehensive implementation of community midwifery services in both urban and regional/rural Australia within the public health system.\n\nThe NMAP calls on both Federal and State/Territory governments to facilitate substantial change to the way in which maternity services are provided, by making available to all women the choice of having a community midwife provide continuous maternity care through the publicly funded health system.\n\nCommunity midwifery services in the main provide continuity of midwifery led care to healthy women throughout the childbearing continuum, in collaboration with other practitioners such as general practitioners and specialist obstetricians, where indicated. Midwives are able to follow individual women across the interface between community and acute health services and to provide care to each woman from early in her pregnancy until the baby is 4-6 weeks of age.\n\nUniversal access to continuity of midwifery care will ensure savings in health dollars and bring Australia into line with international best practice in addition to meeting community demands for a range of readily accessible and appropriate maternity services. Community midwifery is informed by international best practice standards that acknowledge midwives as “the most appropriate and cost effective type of health care provider to be assigned to the care of women in normal pregnancy and birth, including the risk assessment and the recognition of complications” (World Health Organization, 1999, Care in Normal Birth). In other western countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, midwifery is promoted and funded both as a public health and a primary health strategy, since community based care from midwives can be responsive to local needs, particularly with regard to health inequalities and social exclusion.\n\nContinuity of midwifery care has been proven to result in fewer women needing expensive obstetric interventions, such as caesarean surgery and operative deliveries. Research also shows that such care contributes to long-term breastfeeding, improved adjustment to parenting, and may lower the incidence of postnatal depression.

It is home to about 160,000 people, and is also the native land of the Wassoulou genre of music.\n\nWassoulou surrounds the point where the borders of three present-day countries meet: Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea. It includes portions of southwestern Mali, northwestern Ivory Coast, and eastern Guinea. It is bordered by the Niger River to the northwest, and by the Sankarani River to the east.\n\nThe name \"Wassoulou\" is alternately spelled Wassulu, Wassalou, and Ouassalou.\n\nWassoulou is the birthplace of Wassoulou music, a style which blends traditional and modern influences with strong female vocalists and a pentatonic hunter's harp. Wassoulou music is one of the two forms of West African music ethnomusicologists believe to be the origin of the American blues, which developed out of music forms dating back to the American slave trade from West Africa. Some of the most famous residents of Wassoulou include the singers Oumou Sangare, Ramata Diakite and Coumba Sidibe.\n\nWassoulou's cultural importance is reflected in the development of internet resources, and the creation of \"Radio Wassoulou\" broadcasting from Yanfolila.\n\nWassoulou is also a dialect of the Eastern Maninkakan language, and is closely related to Kankan Mandinka. Speakers of Wassoulou number some 73,500 in Guinea, with 41,200 speakers estimated in Mali, where the closely related Bamanankan is also spoken. In the far northwest of Côte d'Ivoire there are some 21,000 Wassoulou speakers, where it is related to Wojenaka Maninka.\n\nInhabitants are known as Wassulu, Wassulunka or Wassulunke.\n\nThe Wassoulou area is a center for the mingling of several ethnic groups. The nomadic Fula people, who were believed to have emigrated from the Fouta Djallon highlands to the west, integrated into the indigenous Mandé peoples and adopting their language and customs sometime prior to the 18th century, at roughly the same time Islam spread into the area. There are also large populations of Mandinka peoples native to Wassoulou.\n\nWassoulou is also the name of an Islamic state, the Wassoulou Empire (1870–1898), ruled by Samori Ture and centered on his capital, Bissandugu. In 1870, Samori overthrew an older Wassoulou state within the Kingdom of Kénédougou, whose \"faama\" (ruler) was Dyanabufarina Modi, and expanded his empire from there, taking the Wassoulou name. While the history of the Mandinka Wassoulou states remain unclear, the small kingdoms of Kenedugu and Wassulu existed from at least the 1650s, benefiting from gold mining and trade in the area.\n\n\n"}
