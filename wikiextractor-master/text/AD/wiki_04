It centers on a group of car thieves and the 48 cars they must steal in a matter of days. The film is known for having wrecked and destroyed 93 cars in a 40-minute car chase scene. A total of 127 cars were either destroyed or damaged throughout the entirety of the film. It is the basis for the 2000 remake starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie.\n\nMaindrian Pace is a respectable insurance investigator who runs an automobile chop shop in Long Beach, California. He is also the leader of a professional car theft ring, who steals and re-sells stolen cars; using the vehicle identification number (VIN), engines, parts, and details (such as parking decals and bumper stickers) sourced from legitimately-purchased wrecks. As an insurance industry insider, Pace does have one small idiosyncrasy: All vehicles stolen must be insured.\n\nPace is approached by a South American drug lord who offers $400,000 in exchange for the theft of 48 specific vehicles, to be delivered to the Long Beach docks within five days. The list includes limousines, semi-trailer trucks, vintage cars, and exotics; rendering the order difficult to fill within the time limit. Nevertheless, Pace is confident that the order can be filled by the March 2, 1974 deadline.\n\nMapping out a basic strategy, the thieves scout out their vehicular targets; all of which have been given female code names. The plan goes smoothly – with even some of the more eclectic vehicles acquired with relative ease – but obstacles mount. Chief of these difficulties is a yellow, 1973 Ford Mustang, code named \"Eleanor.\" The first \"Eleanor\" they come across is occupied; they locate this car again but stealing it results in a chase as its drunken owner pursues Pace. A second \"Eleanor\" is acquired seemingly without issue.\n\nFurther tension enters into the picture when a white Cadillac – stolen as part of the order – is found to contain several kilos of heroin stashed in its trunk. Pace's brother-in-law, Eugene, sees the heroin as a profitable side business; Pace disagrees, viewing the heroin as a threat to the security of the operation. Against Eugene's vehement protests, Pace does not relinquish the heroin, and has the Cadillac and its contents burned at a remote location – unbeknownst to Eugene.\n\nThe theft of all 48 vehicles is soon completed, but the second \"Eleanor\" is discovered to be uninsured within hours of delivery to the docks. After pleas from fiancée Pumpkin Chase, Pace agrees to return it – only because he is aware of a third match for \"Eleanor\" at the International Towers in Long Beach. At the same time, Eugene learns of the Cadillac's fate and attempts to start a brawl; ultimately leaving the office in a rage.\n\nPace prepares to steal the third \"Eleanor\", unaware that Eugene has anonymously tipped off the police. As a result of the tip-off, two detectives (Butch Stockton and Phil Woods) in an unmarked Mercury corner the disguised Pace as he exits the International Towers. A 40-minute car chase (in which 93 vehicles are destroyed) ensues, covering six California cities from Long Beach to Carson. Eluding the police with speed and driving skill, Pace keeps from being caught by police – but not without causing irreparable damage to the car. \n\nPace is now desperate; police blockades and surveillance surround the areas. Pace spots another \"Eleanor\" Mustang pulling into a car wash. Realizing an opportunity, Pace drives the abused Mustang up to the wash entrance, leaves it with the staff, and then dupes the owner of the fourth Mustang (under the guise of being the manager of the car wash). After a quick license plate swap and removal of his disguise, he subsequently leaves the car wash with the intact Mustang.\n\nMeanwhile, the duped owner is inquiring with the manager of the car wash as to the whereabouts of her Mustang – and faints at the sight of the wrecked car as it exits the wash bay. The police, spotting the wrecked Mustang, quickly descend upon the scene to arrest the manager of the car wash, who matches the description of Pace.\n\nThe film ends as Pace clears a police roadblock, driving the fourth \"Eleanor\".\n\n\"Gone in 60 Seconds\" is classified as an independent film. H. B. Halicki wrote, starred, directed, produced and even did his own stuntwork in the film. In a contemporary context, the portions of the film preceding the chase sequences are generally seen as on par with a period B-film. Halicki employed family and friends (instead of professional actors) to play parts in his film to keep the budget low. The characters depicted as being members of the emergency services were actual police officers, firemen, or paramedics. The then-mayor of Carson, California, Sak Yamamoto, also appears as himself.\n\nAll of the police cars damaged in the film, the garbage truck that overturns, three fire trucks (including two waiting for the cars to clear, and another one stopping to put out a fire) were bought at city auction by Halicki in 1972, for an average price of $200 each. Everything sat in an empty lot for over a year until production began in 1973. The fire trucks seen on the Vincent Thomas Bridge during the main chase were real Long Beach FD units on their way to an actual emergency call. The \"crash\" staged for the film blocked both lanes, preventing the trucks from proceeding until the cars were cleared. Halicki asked the camera crew to film them in case he found a place and time to fit the shots into the film.\n\nThere was no official script, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Much of the action/dialog was improvised and ad-libbed by the cast and crew as they went along. This caused many problems for the editor, Warner E. Leighton, who never knew what footage was being dumped on him or where in the film it belonged. In the DVD audio commentary, he described the script for the construction site scenes of the main pursuit as a piece of cardboard with a circle on it. Halicki pointed at it and said, \"That's the dust bowl. We went around it twice. There's your script.\"\n\nThe pursuit is the longest car chase (40 minutes) in film history and takes Pace through five cities as he attempts to lose police. Nearly every civilian vehicle seen in close proximity to the main chase (especially in downtown Long Beach) was owned by Halicki. This resulted in several cars appearing multiple times in the 40-minute sequence. The intact \"Eleanor\" used for beauty shots and the white Ford used by Pace and Stanley can be seen parked in a few Long Beach sequences.\n\nThe workshop scenes at Chase Research were filmed at Halicki's real-life workshop. Occasionally, filming would stop for several days so he could repair cars to earn money and continue production. The building on the waterfront where the vehicles were apparently stored was only used for the outside shot of the building. The final jump was filmed at 190th Street and Green Lane in Redondo Beach, California.\n\nIn one scene at the construction area, a patrol car roars up a hill in pursuit and overturns. This was not planned; the driver inside was nearly crushed when the siren \"can\" on the roof caved the roof in. The scene was left in the finished film.\n\nJ.C. Agajanian Jr., who plays a detective in the roadblock sequence at Torrance Mazda Agency, was almost hit when Halicki missed his braking mark, hitting one of the unmarked Plymouth Belvedere patrol cars, sending it careening towards Agajanian, who missed it by quick reflexes and luck. The near collision was left in the film and is very apparent.\n\nThe scene where \"Eleanor\" is rear-ended by a Cadillac Eldorado on the northbound Harbor Freeway (then-signed as California State Highway 11 and later as Interstate 110) at the Carson Street exit, and spins into a light pole at 100 mph was a real accident. Halicki was badly hurt and filming was stopped while he recovered. According to people on the set, the first thing Halicki said when he regained consciousness was, \"Did we get coverage?\" Likewise, the film's opening scene captures the aftermath of a real-life train derailment that was not part of the original shooting script; when Halicki heard about this, he wanted to incorporate it into the film. From the part in the scene when \"Eleanor\" comes to a stop after hitting the light pole, the cut-scene edit when the detective in chase sticks his head out of the passenger window and says, \"He just hit a damned light pole\", the scene immediately following was 3 weeks later. Halicki finished the rest of the film in a full leg cast and several broken ribs.\n\nThe Ford Country Squire station wagon that flips during the earlier night-time chase in Torrance was overturned by six men lifting it up from one side. The film was later skip-framed to create the desired effect.\n\nThe garbage truck that overturns was pulled by cables attached to two tow trucks. The cables attached to the top of the truck are clearly visible as it topples.\n\nTo achieve the effect of cars sliding into each other at Moran Cadillac, an oil slick was placed under the tires of the first car to assist it in sliding. According to the commentary track on the DVD, the film company owned the first two Cadillacs in the row; the remainder were the dealer's. When it came time to do the stunt, the oil trick worked too well – many of the agency's own Cadillacs were badly damaged. Halicki had to purchase all of them.\n\nThe jump scene at the end of the chase is notable and set the standards for a number of subsequent pictures. Acting as the climax to the lengthy chase sequence, the \"Eleanor\" jump managed to achieve a height of 30' over a 128' distance, a feat rarely attempted today without CGI or a gas-driven catapult (as was used to jump the General Lee in the 2005 film remake of \"The Dukes of Hazzard).\"\n\nHalicki compacted ten vertebrae performing this jump. The injury was not serious, although director of photography Jack Vacek claims that Halicki never walked the same again.\n\nWith the exception of a few cast extras, the bulk of the bystanders in the film are the general public going about their business. This caused several incidents wherein people assumed a real police pursuit was in progress, with many trying to help the accident \"victims\". For example in the scene at the Carson Street off-ramp, where the two cars collide after Maindrian drives against traffic, a pedestrian can be seen in the background shouting angrily at the passing police cars for not stopping to help the occupants. Much of the crowd at the gas station, where Harold Smith is pulled over after the nighttime Torrance chase, were part of a real biker gang who verbally abused the police officers \"arresting\" the actor and demanded they leave him alone.\n\nRonald Halicki, the director's real-life brother who played Corlis Pace in the film, operated the crane that lifted \"Jill\", the red Challenger, to its fate in the car-crusher at the junkyard.\n\nWhen Maindrian is first telling Atlee about the new contract, a message on the blackboard behind them says, \"Sgt. Hawkins called about Vacek case\" — a reference to director of photography Jack Vacek. The license plate of the Rolls-Royce outside the airport reads, \"HBH,\" the initials of the film's star/director/writer, H. B. Halicki.\n\nWhen Pumpkin tells Maindrian that they have to give \"Eleanor\" back because the car is not insured, Maindrian reads the owner's address from a newspaper: 18511 S. Mariposa Ave, Gardena. This was, in fact, Halicki's home address at the time.\n\nEarly in the film, when the boys are stripping down the Challenger, they are conversing about how Atlee became a \"professional\". Atlee says, \"Butch Stockton was a professional and he got caught.\" Butch Stockton is the driver of 1-Baker-11 in the film.\n\nThe original version of the film was released on video in the early 1980s twice: by Full Throttle Video and again by Media Home Entertainment. Other releases followed in 1989 again by Media Home Entertainment but the significance was that it had Hi-Fi audio. In 1990, Video Treasures released the last VHS version to include the original soundtrack. This release was on LP duplicated tape and did not include HI-FI audio. All other releases were released as SP mode tape as some sleeves had a SP mode sticker on the front of the jacket.\n\nIn 2000, Denice Shakarian Halicki and her business partner Michael Leone, under the banner Halicki Films, released the 25th anniversary remastered edition on DVD and VHS to American viewers. This special remastered edition contained a restored digital print of the film from the original 35mm masters, however all of the original music was replaced, due to rights issues, as were the sound effects and some dialog was even modified. In May 2005, a Region 2 DVD was released in Europe.\n\nThe pre-release version of the film can be seen (albeit in still frame form) on the 25th Anniversary DVD. By accessing the hidden \"Easter Egg\", one can watch an older version of the film, which contains many deleted scenes in the film's first half. At this time it is unknown whether this version will ever be released to the public in full form.\n\nIn the Speed Channel broadcast of the film, a 2002 documentary, hosted by Denice Halicki, is shown before the beginning of the film. The documentary described the production processes of the films produced by H.B. Halicki as well as his life.\n\nOn October 16, 2012, Denice Halicki and Leone, under the banner Halicki Films, released the \"Gone in 60 seconds\" DVD/Blu-ray combo pack. It includes a rare interview with Lee Iacocca.\n\nIn 1977, a follow-up of some sorts, titled \"Double Nickels\", was released featuring most of the cast and crew from \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" including Jack Vacek, Ed Abrams, George Cole, and Mick Brennan, who would work for Halicki in his next two films, \"The Junkman\" and \"Deadline Auto Theft\". Tony Syslo was the same cinematographer who later worked on those films, as well. Halicki received a special thanks credit in the film.\n\nOn June 9, 1989, Toby and Denice Halicki began to shoot the 1989 reboot \"Gone in 60 Seconds 2\", which would star them both. The reboot would not have the same storyline of 1974 film; Toby Halicki wanted a new and bigger story about a professional international thief. He bought over 400 cars to destroy for the film.\n\nOn August 20, 1989, while filming in Dunkirk and Buffalo, New York, Halicki was preparing for a dramatic stunt sequence in the film, during which a 160 ft. (49m) tall water tower was supposed to topple to the ground. When a cable attached to the tower snapped unexpectedly, it sheared off a telephone pole, which fell on Halicki, killing him instantly.\n\nIn light of the 1989 reboot of \"Gone in 60 Seconds 2\" project and their marriage, the Halicki estate faced a number of legal challenges. After seven trials, in 1994 the court released Halicki's films and the associated copyrights to Denice Shakarian Halicki, but she was forced to sell her husband's car and toy collection to pay the legal fees. Halicki planned to finish her late husband's dream and make a new \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" film based on the 1989 unfinished film.\n\nIn 1995, Denice Shakarian Halicki kept her husband's legacy alive by licensing and producing a 2000 remake of Halicki's original 1974 film, along with Disney (under their Touchstone Pictures banner) and Jerry Bruckheimer. \"Eleanor\" reprised her role as a 1967 Customized Ford Mustang, appearing alongside master car thief Randall \"Memphis\" Raines (Nicolas Cage).\n\nThanks to the popularity of the remake, a number of car shops started to produce the copyrighted character \"Eleanor\" image and trademark name; Denice Halicki again had to resort to legal action to protect the trademark and the copyrighted Eleanor's image. In 2008, Halicki won a case against Carroll Shelby, who had been selling \"Eleanor\" using Eleanor's Trademark name and Copyrighted image.\n\n\n"}

The book's central idea is to name and blame a long list of specific individuals whom Goldberg implicates in making the United States a \"far more selfish, vulgar, and cynical place.\" In 2006, Goldberg updated his book, releasing 110 People Who Are Screwing Up America.\n\nGoldberg's book denounces many people—mostly left-of-center celebrities, politicians and newscasters—and takes umbrage at high-profile incidents like Janet Jackson's exposing herself \"in front of one-fifth of all the kids in America under age eleven\" during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show (p. vi). It decries as \"Hollywood blowhards\" actors who call American politicians \"Nazis\" while praising \"dictators like Fidel Castro\" (pp. vii–ix). Goldberg's chapter for Courtney Love is simply the word \"\"ho\"\".\n\nOther people (on the cover) include: filmmaker Michael Moore (#1), Democratic leader Howard Dean, reverend Al Sharpton, and rapper Eminem.\n\nThe book takes aim at \"liberals [who are] snooty, snobby know-it-alls, who have gotten angrier and angrier in recent years and who think they're not only smarter, but also \"better\", than everyone else, especially everyone else who lives in a 'red state'—a population they see as hopelessly dumb and pathetically religious\" (p. x). While the book mainly criticises liberals, there are a few moderate and even conservative individuals mentioned, notably Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh.\n\nThe subtitle, \"and Al Franken is #37\", is likely a response to Al Franken's \"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\", which contains a chapter entitled, \"I Bitch-Slap Bernie Goldberg\", focused on debunking Goldberg's previous book \"Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News\".\n\nJonah Goldberg (no relation), editor of \"National Review\", said the following of the book: \"Goldberg is no down-the-line conservative, and you are certain to disagree with some of his choices and rankings -- and probably also with his often salty language. Nevertheless, \"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America\" is a rollicking and revealing look at 100 of the most egregious obstacles on the path of our nation's return to glory.\"\n\nA review by Brent Bozell, President of the conservative Media Research Center, also offered praise for the book: \"\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America\" is out, and it's a wonderful read for anyone not on that list.\"\n\n\"It's easy to presume that this is the conservatives' answer to recent published tirades against the Right by leftists like Franken and Michael Moore, but there are important distinctions,\" wrote Bozell. \"First, Goldberg doesn't limit the list to those on the Left. Jimmy Swaggart makes the list, as does Michael Savage. Many in the religious Right will quarrel with his selection of Judge Roy Moore. All should applaud his choice of David Duke.\"\n\nIn a review in \"The New York Times\", Richard Brookhiser wrote, \"Such books are part of the puppet theater of modern political discourse\" and that \"any clever and combative person could write 80 percent of this book, or its mirror image, in a weekend.\" Brookhiser also questioned the legitimacy of the book's arguments, given that the successes of many in the list are made possible by the public. He rhetorically asked: \"Shouldn't Goldberg's book be \"270 Million People Who Are Screwing Up America\"?\"\n\nCathy Young, whom Goldberg praised in the book for her criticism of radical feminism, has argued that the conservatives on Goldberg's list are either \"safe\" targets who are not powerful or influential in conservative circles, or \"tokens\" inserted to create the appearance that Goldberg is not being partisan. She suggests that discredited televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, for instance, is a \"safe\" alternative to Pat Robertson, who is still a fixture on the Christian right. Responding to Goldberg's assertions that he is not taking political sides, Young questions why his criticisms of \"haters\" who \"demonize\" their opponents extends to multiple individuals on the left, but only a single conservative, talk radio host Michael Savage. Young suggests that Ann Coulter would belong on the list, but Goldberg only mentions her by way of making a favorable comparison to Savage. Young also suggests that Goldberg employs a double standard in defending Coulter because she offers invective \"with a twinkle in her eye\" while simultaneously dismissing the notion that some of Al Franken's statements should be taken less seriously because he is engaging in satire.\n\nGoldberg received criticism of his inclusion of rappers in the book. The book attributes the creation of gangsta rap to the record label Interscope Records; gangsta rap had been around commercially for at least six years prior to any involvement from the record label. Artists such as Ice-T and N.W.A both had platinum-selling success as gangsta rap artists before the founding of Interscope. The book claims that Interscope Records was entirely funded by Ted Field, when it was actually to a large extent—as much as 50%—funded by Atlantic Records.\n\nOn July 13, 2005, Goldberg appeared on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\" to promote the book. Jon Stewart, a liberal, criticized the list for suggesting that liberals who do not hold positions of power, such as Barbra Streisand, were responsible for problems in America, while conservatives who held powerful positions in the Bush Administration or Republican Congress were not held responsible for anything. Goldberg agreed that the list included more liberals than conservatives but responded that his book dealt with cultural issues. Stewart also argued that the book focused on a \"culture war\" he sees as largely \"fabricated,\" and that declining rates of homicide and teen drug use suggest that, in fact, American culture is not as troubled as Goldberg suggests. Stewart argued that people who \"say a bad word on television\" don't affect people's lives, while government officials do. \"I wish smart guys like you spent less time worrying about Barbra Streisand and more time worrying about Richard Perle or Karl Rove, or whoever the Democrats had in those positions during the Clinton years,\" Stewart said. Goldberg argued in response that the culture is important and that he intended the book to raise the public discourse because many of the people on his list had turned public debate into bickering and name-calling.\n\nSome of those included on the list have responded to the book humorously. Cartoonists Jeff Danziger and Ted Rall both said it was \"an honor\" to be included on the list, with the latter adding, \"Not only am I grouped with many people whom I admire for their achievements and patriotism, I'm being demonized by McCarthyite thugs I despise.\" Entrepreneur Todd Goldman quipped that he \"hope[s] to be ranked higher next year.\"\n\nGoldberg's book prompted a response from Jack Huberman, who wrote \"101 People Who Are Really Screwing America (and Bernard Goldberg is Only #73)\".\n\nMatt Kunitz (executive producer of \"Fear Factor\" and No. 69 in Goldberg's book) told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"I look at my company; I think Michael Moore was No 1. I don't mind being in that group of people.\"\n\nTen new entries were added in Goldberg's 2006 update, \"110 People Who Are Screwing Up America\". Among these are the white nationalist band Prussian Blue, anti-homosexual preacher Fred Phelps, spam mailer Jeremy Jaynes, former United States Attorney General and lawyer-activist Ramsey Clark, and several Supreme Court Justices.\n\nBarbara Kingsolver responded to her inclusion on the list in her book \"Animal, Vegetable, Miracle\". She joked about the inclusion and said that she was proud to be on the list with people such as Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe book was referenced in the manifesto of Jim David Adkisson, the gunman who killed two people and wounded seven others in the Knoxville Unitarian Universalist church shooting.\n\n"}

Two important decisions were made through voting during the session – namely the selection of the hosting city for the 2012 Summer Olympics, and a review of the 28 sports currently represented in the summer games.\n\nThe session was held at the Raffles City Convention Centre, which is on level 4 of the Raffles City complex. The opening ceremony on 5 July 2005 was held at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay.\n\nAn exhibition was launched at the podium of the Raffles City Shopping Complex, that would continue until 10 July.\n\nThe IOC Session commenced.\n\nThe IOC's Executive Board started two days of meetings.\n\nThe Executive Board meetings resumed with updates on the progress of preparations for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver by their respective representatives. The board approved Beijing's request to hold the equestrian events in Hong Kong, which is a separate NOC from mainland China in the \"best interests of the competition and the well-being of the horses\".\n\nThe opening ceremony was held at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay and the guest of honour was the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, who officially opened the session. A special type of hybrid orchid had been bred to commemorate the IOC Session in Singapore. It was named Vanda IOC. A cultural performance of dance and songs was held with the theme of \"One Voice, One Rhythm, One World\".\n\nThe ceremony was attended by IOC members and more than 2.000 other guests, included many foreign leaders (it was the most prolific IOC event in history) :\n\nEach of the five bid cities had 45 minutes to make a final presentation to the IOC members, after which voting commenced and the final results were announced at 19:30 Singapore time. Local sailor Griselda Khng handed an envelope holding the result of the vote to IOC president Jacques Rogge, who announced: \"The International Olympic Committee has the honor of announcing, that the games of the 30th Olympiad, in 2012, are awarded to the city of London.\"\n\nThe result of the vote was as follows:\n\nThe final evaluation report of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens was presented and the Athens Games were finally closed. Reports on the progress of preparations for future Games were also submitted.\n\nThe 28 sports in the Summer Olympics programme that existed at that time were all put up on the ballots, three years after a similar attempt failed to gain support from IOC members during the 114th IOC Session in Mexico City. Prior to the voting, baseball, softball, modern pentathlon, taekwondo and fencing were considered as most likely to be dropped. Five non-Olympic sports would then be voted to get in, in case any of the existing sports would be dropped, as IOC rules allow a maximum of 28 Summer Olympic sports. These sports – golf, roller sports, squash, rugby and karate – were recommended by the IOC Olympic Games Program Committee, which has shotlisted the sports that applied to be included. Golf and rugby were considered the favorites to be voted in, both mainly for their popularity and also for their relatively small number of events (each one, if accepted, would have consisted of 2 events).\n\nIOC President Jacques Rogge has been a keen supportive of this move, which was one of his agendas since being elected in 2001, while the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) said changing the current set of 28 sports risked changing the \"magic combination of team sports and individual sports\", attributing one of the success factors of the Olympic games to the current programme.\n\nA few days before the votes were cast, the IOC accepted the ASOIF request that the number of votes given for each sport will not be published, only \"yay\" or \"nay\". The reason given for the unusual request was in order to avoid a \"popularity ranking\" of all Olympic sports. Any sport that would get a simple majority of \"nay\" would be dropped from the Olympic program in 2012, but would remain eligible for readmission in future Games.\n\nIn the morning IOC members voted to remove baseball and softball from the games. The decision has triggered dismay in some nations such as the United States where both sports originated from, and Canada, where both have a strong following. Some attributed the exclusion of baseball to the fact that Major League Baseball did not allow its players to participate in the Olympics, held during the season (unlike the National Hockey League that allowed it since the 1998 Winter Olympics) and the widespread use of prohibited drugs in the professional leagues. The main reason for exclusion of softball was that it was included as a women-only sport mainly to be a gender-equalizer bat-and-ball sport for baseball (men-only sport), and with baseball out this reasoning no longer existed. Another reason given was that both sports consist of large teams and their elimination will make room for many athletes, in comparison to modern pentathlon, for example, which only consist of 64 athletes.\n\nIn the afternoon, a secret vote by IOC members gave squash and karate over 51% of votes, but a subsequent vote to include them in the list of Olympic sports in the Olympic Charter has failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority needed for such amendment. Therefore, by the end of the day two sports were dropped and none added, and the program of the 2012 Summer Olympics was reduced to 26 sports.\n\nThat night at The Oriental Singapore, then SNOC president and defence minister, Teo Chee Hean threw a banquet. Rogge gave Singapore full marks for the session organisation, a perfect 6.\n\nLambis Nikolaou of Greece and Chiharu Igaya from Japan were elected as Vice presidents. Singapore's IOC member, Ng Ser Miang was elected to the IOC Executive Board to replace Nikolaou, whose term as board member was due to expire.\n\nA Canadian television report said that the session had placed the country in the centre of the sporting universe and that the spotlight was on six cities, not just the five candidate cities.\n\nThe media said that most visitors' first taste of Singapore was an annoying ding-dong alert sound produced in a taxi when it exceeds the speed limit. The speaking of the slang Singlish was highlighted, together with the country's chewing gum laws.\n\nReferences were made to Singapore's tough drug laws, the traffic jams and the tight security checks. The British daily, \"The Guardian\" wrote on the terrorism spectre that stalks the Games, noting that \"Even here in Singapore, during the meeting of the 116 members, security has at times been stifling. Access to the Swissôtel, where the members are staying, has been severely restricted and squadrons of Gurkhas armed with hand- and machine-guns patrol inside and outside the hotel.\"\n\nTwo years later in 2008 Singapore was awarded the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.\n\nThere was some kind of confusion by the foreign newspapers mixing up the high-end Raffles Hotel with the Raffles City. Reuters wrote \"It is a national monument, the jewel in Singapore's crown, and this week, Raffles Hotel will becoming a bubbling cauldron of lobbying and politics as it stages the most keenly contested Olympic venue vote in the history of the Games. Its Colonial style salons and parlours will be overrun by bid officials and consultants, celebrities and spin-doctors.\" Later, it clarified that the vote was actually at the adjacent Raffles City Convention Centre and not the hotel.\n\nBritish paper, \"The Guardian\", in a report on the London team isolating themselves on Sentosa wrote, \"They have deliberately retreated from the hothouse atmosphere of the Raffles Hotel complex, the venue for the IOC congress, to perfect a final pitch they believe will be crucial in gathering the votes London requires to win.\"\n\nThe \"Weekend Australian\" reported, \"First order of the business that day at Raffles Hotel will be determining whether any changes are to be made to the Olympic programme...\" \"The Bangkok Post\" said, \"Members of the International Olympic Committee from around the globe will meet 6 July-9 July at the historic Raffles Hotel to pick the hosts of the 2012 Games of the Olympiad.\"\n\nThe trio who sung the Olympic Hymn in Greek was criticised by both the media and the audience. They were Singaporean soprano Khor Ai Ming, Singaporean tenor William Lim and Japanese soprano Satsuki Nagatome. The trio sung with gusto just before the announcement of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Guardian reported on their operatic rendition \"Two Singaporean sopranos and a tenor dressed like a maître d' subjected the Olympic anthem, a tune whose primary virtue is to be heard only once every four years, to a fearful mauling.\" The Times of the UK described them as \"three Orientals... one distinctly off key\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2187924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187924", "title": "1987 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1987 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1987 Pacific hurricane season was the last year in which the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center was the primary warning center for tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The season officially started May 15, 1987, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1987, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1987. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when the vast majority of tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nDespite there being 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms directly affected land. Hurricane Eugene was the first Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain in the Continental United States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.\n\nOverall, the season continued the general trend in the 1980s of well above-average seasons in the East Pacific. In 1987, there were 20 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes, and four major hurricanes, all were well above average, save the number of major hurricanes which was only slightly above normal. The former made 1987 the fifth most active season on record at that time. Today, 1987 is tied with the 1994 Pacific hurricane season and the 2009 Pacific hurricane season as the sixth most active on record. In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, one storm peaked at hurricane strength (Peke) and one peaked as a tropical storm (Oka). Two tropical storms entered this area of responsibility from the east by crossing 140°W.\n\nThe season lasted a total 171 days beginning with the formation of Adrian and early June and the dissipation of Tropical Depression Twenty on November 25. There was a total of 924 storms hours and 631 hurricane hours. By comparison, the long-term averages at that time were 161 season days, 875 tropical storm hours, and 664 hurricane hours. 397 advisories were issued, which was below the 1977–1987 average of 428. The Hurricane Hunters did not fly into any of the storms in 1987. This was also the first year where tropical storm watches and warnings were issued instead of gale watches and warnings for tropical cyclones. 1987 was the last season that the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City was responsible for forecasting in this basin, a task it had performed since circa 1972. The EPHC was folded into the National Hurricane Center, which took responsibility for the basin starting in the spring of 1988.\n\nOnly one tropical storm developed in June. In July, six named storms formed. Out of these storms, Hilary was the only storm to reach major hurricane status. The month of August had a total of five named storms, four of which became hurricanes. However, August did not feature any major hurricanes, though Hurricane Jova came close, peaking as a moderate Category 2. The month of September held the same number of named storms as August, with five named storms. The month also was the carrier of the strongest hurricane on record at that time (that had its intensity estimated from satellite imagery), Hurricane Max, a strong Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Norma was a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, which dissipated to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. The month of October featured only two tropical cyclones. The first system, Ramon, was a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nVery few cyclones this season impacted land. The only landfalling hurricane of the year, Hurricane Eugene was responsible for significantly damaging about 15 sq. mi of fruit crop, where damage estimated were at $2.6 million (1987 USD) In all, damage totaled to about $142 million. Tropical Storm Irwin, paralleled the coast of Mexico, causing flooding near Acapulco. Damage was totaled at $2.1 million (1987 USD). The remnants of Norma and Pilar produced rain over Baja California Sur. The remnants of Ramon brought extremely heavy rains to the Western United States.\n\nA moderate El Niño was present throughout the season, with water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific was above normal. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period;.\nmodern estimates place the PDO for 1987 at above normal.\n\nOn June 7, a tropical depression formed southeast of Acapulco. It strengthened into a tropical storm immediately thereafter. After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) on June 8, Adrian slowly weakened. It fell to tropical depression status on June 9 and dissipated later that day. During its life, Adrian paralleled the Mexican shoreline far offshore before looping counter-clockwise over its path when it was a depression.\n\nOn July 3, a tropical depression formed south of Cabo San Lucas. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. Beatriz slowly strengthened and moved generally northwest as it stayed far offshore. On July 5, Beatriz reached its peak wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h). It weakened thereafter, falling to a depression on July 6 and dissipating the next day.\n\nA tropical depression formed south of Mexico on July 5 and immediately strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. Calvin headed generally east. On July 8, as a strong tropical storm. It then gradually weakened, falling to a depression on July 9 and dissipated the next day while located southwest of Cabo San Lucas.\n\nA tropical depression that had organized on July 15 while located south of Cabo San Lucas. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm that same day while located around 215 mi (345 km) west of Acapulco. Dora headed west-northwest and slowly strengthened. It reached its peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 17. It then steadily weakened, becoming a depression two days later. Dora dissipated on July 20 while located west of Cabo San Lucas.\nA tropical disturbance developed into a tropical depression on July 22 near the coast of Mexico. It initially headed westward and strengthened into a tropical storm the same day it formed. It strengthened into a hurricane, the first of the season, on July 24 as an upper-level cyclone pulled the system north. After peaking as a low-end Category 2 hurricane on July 25, land interaction weakened the hurricane to Category 1 as it made landfall west of Manzanillo. The rough topography weakened Eugene, and the hurricane was only a depression when it emerged into the Gulf of California. It promptly dissipated on July 26.\n\nWhen the storm first posed a threat to Mexico on July 24, the port of Zinuhuatenjo was closed for small craft. Operation classes were suspended in Acapulco. In Manzanillo, the port was officially closed down. The Mexican navy was put on alert for a total distance of . The weather service issued navigation warnings for three coastal states and ships were urged to maintain contact with officials. Hurricane Eugene caused extremely heavy rain in coastal parts of Mexico. The highest rain was 20.68 inches at Aquila, Michoacán. The system was responsible for the highest tropical cyclone caused rainfall in five Mexican states. Over 5,000 people were displaced. In Manzanillo alone, at least 60 people were rendered homeless. Most of the damage was the scattering of debris and mud. Six people were injured, and a man in Venustiano Carrazano was killed when a palm tree was blown over. In all, three fatalities were reported. The hurricane destroyed about 15 sq. mi (39 km) of fruit crop in the country, amounting to more than $2.6 million in damage (1987 USD). Additionally, damage to eight beach houses totaled to $120,000. Total crop damage reached $142 million (1987 USD); In the aftermath of the storm, the navy and army and local government devised a cleanup plan. They worked quickly to restore water and power service, and within a few days the services had been restored for most of the impacted area.\n\nAt a location more westerly than typical for eastern Pacific hurricanes, Tropical Depression Nine-E formed on July 24. Heading west, the cyclone reached tropical storm intensity on July 25. Fernanda strengthened and reached its peak strength near hurricane status on July 26, the same day it crossed 140°W and entered the central north Pacific. Fernanda headed in the general direction of the Hawaiian Islands as a trough approached. The trough caused wind shear, which weakened the cyclone into a tropical depression on July 28. Fernanda dissipated three days later.\n\nA tropical wave left the coast of Panama on July 26. It organized into Tropical Depression Ten on July 28 while located and it strengthened into a tropical storm the day after the system formed. Over water, the cyclone steadily intensified as it roughly paralleled the Mexican coast while remaining far offshore. Greg became a hurricane on 1800 UTC July 31 and peaked with wind speeds of 80 mph (130 kmh) on August 1. It then weakened as it moved over cooler water, falling to tropical storm intensity later on August 1. At this time, Greg was located away from Baja California. It then weakened into depression intensity on August 2, and completely dissipated the next day. Greg affected Mexico a few weeks after Eugene did, resulting in additional flooding. Due to both storms, the region registered rainfall amounts for times the average.\n\nA tropical wave moved through Central America on July 30 and July 31. Steered by a large deep-layer ridge that extended as far southwest as Hawaii and as far northeast as Oklahoma, the wave moved steadily west-northwest. Thunderstorm activity increased considerably after 0000 UTC on July 31. A tropical depression formed at 1800 UTC on July 31 while located south of Cabo San Lucas. The cyclone strengthened at a steady pace and reached hurricane intensity on August 1. Hilary continued strengthening, and became a hurricane on August 2. On August 3, the cyclone reached Category 3 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, making it the first major hurricane of the season. At its peak strength, which it reached on August 4, Hilary had winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). It then weakened, and had fallen to Category 1 intensity on August 5. The hurricane then restrengthened, maintaining Category 2 intensity until August 6. The system then began a terminal weakening trend. By August 7 it was only a tropical storm. After falling to depression strength, Hilary dissipated on August 9 over waters. In Southern California, officials hoped that Hilary would produce a major increase in waves in time for a surfing tournament finals, though only a small increase in wave action was expected.\n\nA tropical depression formed on August 3 over south of Manzanillo. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm. Irwin fluctuated in strength as it closely paralleled the coast of Mexico. On August 6, Irwin reached its maximum winds of 65 mph (100 km/h); it maintained that velocity for over two days. During August 8, Irwin turned nearly due west and headed out to sea. Irwin weakened to a tropical depression on August 9 and immediately dissipated. Forecasters at one point in time noted the possibility of the storm impacting California. In addition, the storm produced heavy rainfall in Mexico, causing $2.1 million in damage. Although many businesses and homes received damage, no deaths were reported.\n\nA tropical depression formed on August 13, while located south-southeast from Baja California Sur. The cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Jova the next day. The depression initially moved to the west-southwest due to a ridge north of the system. It slowly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity on 1800 UTC August 16. The intensifying hurricane then turned west-northwest. When it peaked on August 17, Jova was a moderate Category 2 hurricane. After peaking, Jova slowly weakened as it turned westbound. It was in a moderately declining state when it crossed 140°W and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Jova continued to weaken, and was a depression by August 20. Jova dissipated two days later while due south of the Big Island of Hawaii over water, although it remnants were still visible south of Johnston Atoll until at least August 24. Jova generated heavy surf for a few days in Southern California.\n\nA disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone organized into Tropical Depression One-C on August 26. Twelve hours later, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Oka, which is Hawaiian for Oscar. Oka slowly moved west-northwest and reached its peak wind speed of 60 mph (95 kmh) on August 27. The next day, a nearby trough caused wind shear, which weakened Oka to a depression on August 29 and subsequently destroyed it.\n\nOn August 28, a tropical depression formed west Manzanillo, Mexico. Twelve hours later, it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Knut. Never attaining winds stronger than 40 mph (65 kmh), Knut stayed a tropical storm for one day. It weakened to a tropical depression on August 30 and dissipated later that day. The cyclone stayed out at sea for its entire life, and never threatened land.\n\nKnut had no impact on land. However, its name was retired in 1992 for unknown reasons and was replaced by Kenneth. \n\nLidia originated from a disturbance that entered the basin on August 28. It remained south of the Mexican coast in an area of warm sea surface temperatures, and at 1800 UTC August 29, Tropical Depression Fifteen formed. It intensified into a tropical storm six hours after development about away from Baja California Sur. Lidia moved northwest, paralleling the Mexican coast. It edged in a more westerly direction for a day before resuming its northwesterly path, and reached hurricane intensity on 0600 UTC September 1. At its strongest on September 1 based on intensity estimates via Dvorak classifications, Hurricane Lidia had a wind speed of 85 mph (140 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Lidia began weakening and lost hurricane intensity on September 2. Lidia weakened very rapidly over cold water. Early the next day, Lidia weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over waters on 1200 UTC September 3. The remnants of the storm; however, brought showers to California. One woman was injured by a lightning strike.\n\nA tropical disturbance left Central America on September 8. At 1200 UTC on September 9, a tropical depression formed over the warm waters south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. While located from Cabo San Lucas, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Max. Heading west-northwest, Max rapidly intensified and became a hurricane on September 11, over a day after it was named. Turning northwest, Max continued to intensify. By September 10, the cyclone reached Category 2 intensity, and became a major hurricane several hours later. On September 12, Hurricane Max reached Category 4 intensity. The cyclone reached its maximum windspeed of 155 mph (250 km/h) on September 13. Meanwhile, a then-record was set for the highest satellite estimates for a Pacific hurricane. At that time, Dvorak classifications, which measure a tropical cyclones intensity, were at \"7.0\", which was then the highest ever recorded in the basin, though this was later matched by hurricanes Hernan and Trudy of the 1990 Pacific hurricane season.\n\nMax maintained its intensity for then unprecedented 24 hours. However, the storm crossed the isotherm and began to weaken rapidly. The hurricane's track then shifted north for a time, before turning to the west on September 15. That same day, the weakened to a tropical storm. The tropical cyclone dissipated at 1200 UTC September 16 while located north-northeast of Cabo San Lucas. The hurricane was predicted to send waves to Southern California, though Max was well past its peak at that time.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed on September 13 while located southwest of Acapulco. Moving northwest, a depression formed on September 14 far from land. It took over 24 hours to reach tropical storm strength. Norma paralleled the coast far offshore. The storm steadily intensified over sea surface temperatures. On September 17, Norma turned to the north, and became a minimal hurricane for 12 hours as an eye became visible on infrared imagery. Norma turned northbound toward land. However, Norma remained offshore due weak southwesterly flow from a cutoff low located west of Baja California Sur. The cyclone stalled and then edged slightly east when it weakened back into a depression on September 19. Tropical Depression Norma dissipated a mere south of the Baja California Peninsula; it never made landfall.\n\nPrior to the remains of Hurricane Norma's arrival in the Southwestern United States, forecasters were anticipating cloudy skies over San Diego. Over the deserts and mountains near the area, there was also a possibility of heavy rainfall. The remnants ultimately caused rainfall and thunderstorms in California on September 22 and September 23. The rainfall totaled to at Lindbergh Field, and at Lemon Grove. There were numerous power outages, small fires, some road flooding, and some property damage. In San Diego and southern Orange County, 200,000 homes and business lost power, but the power was quickly restored. However, there are no reports of damage or flooding in Baja California from the storm; the area the tropical cyclone struck was sparsely populated.\n\nOtis originated from the a tropical disturbance in the monsoon trough. It moved over the warm waters south of the Mexican Riviera from September 17 to September 19. At 0000 UTC September 20, the disturbance was upgraded into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E while moving to the northwest. It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day while located southwest of La Paz. Eighteen hours later on September 21, Otis became a hurricane. It also began to turn back to the west and began to undergo a period of rapid deepening. The hurricane would then reach Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. The next day, Otis reached its peak windspeed of 115 mph (185 km/h). It would oscillate irregularly between that strength and Category 2 intensity until September 24. That day, it began accelerating to the west as it lost strength due to increased wind shear and water. Otis fell to tropical storm strength on September 25 and a depression on September 26, and dissipated shortly after that. \n\nAn area of disturbed weather southwest of Hawaii gathered enough convection and a closed circulation to become Tropical Depression Two-C on September 21. It immediately strengthened into a storm and was named Peke. Peke continued to strengthen as it tracked north just east of the International dateline. Peke intensified into a hurricane on September 23 and reached Category 2 intensity the next day. Peke continued heading north and shortly after weakening into a Category 1 hurricane, it turned to the northwest and crossed the dateline. It re-intensified, and peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) typhoon on September 23. It accelerated to the northwest and began to take in drier air, which caused weakening. On October 2, Peke re-curved to the southeast. The last advisory on this tropical cyclone was issued on October 3 as it dissipated. Peke's remnants continued drifting erratically for over three days, first heading east, then northwest, and then southeast, at which time they were finally unidentifiable.\n\nHurricane/Typhoon Peke caused no damages or deaths. However, was also the first tropical cyclone of hurricane strength to cross the dateline since 1967's Hurricane Sarah to cross the dateline at that strength. In addition, Peke was the third tropical cyclone in three years to exist on both sides of the dateline, after 1985's Typhoon Skip and 1986's Typhoon Georgette.\n\nA tropical depression formed on September 30 while located south of the Baja California Peninsula. It headed north and peaked as a minimal tropical storm on October 1. After being a tropical storm for a mere six hours, Pilar weakened to a depression and dissipated that same day. It never made landfall, dissipating just south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. It was a tropical cyclone for a total of 24 hours. The system caused no known damage on land, but Pilar dropped heavy precipitation on Baja California Sur from 1200 UTC on September 30 until 0000 UTC October 2. An observer station reported of rainfall. This was the most rainfall the weather station had ever recorded since its founding in 1969.\nOn October 3–4 an area of disturbed weather moved into the Pacific Ocean south of a high pressure area over Central Mexico. The storm became better organized over waters. By October 5, a tropical storm had developed southwest of Manzanillo, bypassing the tropical depression stage. It moved generally to the west-northwest. Ramon intensified into a hurricane on October 7 and reached major hurricane status on October 8. At its most intense on October 9 and October 10, Hurricane Ramon had winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest due to interaction with subtropical jetstream winds and rapidly weakened over cooler sea surface temperatures. It became a tropical storm on October 11 and a depression on October 12. It dissipated shortly thereafter.\n\nTorrential rains deluged Southern California, resulting in street flooding. Two people perished in separate traffic accidents. In Los Angeles, three more people perished in separate traffic incidents. Heavy rains extended west and was also reported in Hemet in Riverside County, where three people were also injured during a car accident. The rains helped dissolve a week-long forest fire 16,000 acre (65,000,000 m²) on Mt. Palomar. The Spring Creek River overflowed its banks. The tropical moisture also helped end a 37-day dry spell at Salt Lake City, marking the longest time the city went without rain since 1964. Nationwide, Ramon killed five people, all due to road-related incidents.\n\nOn October 27, a tropical depression formed and headed northwest, gradually re-curving north. It intensified into a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm on October 28. Selma maintained that strength until the next day, when it weakened to a depression. Selma's re-curving continued, and on October 29, it again intensified into a 40 mph (65 km/h) tropical storm. Without further strengthening, it weakened into a tropical depression, headed north northeast, and dissipated on October 31 about east of the southern tip of Baja California.\n\nOn June 10, a weak tropical depression, the second of the season, developed. It moved very little and did not affect land. It dissipated on 1200 UTC June 12. The season's next tropical cyclone, Tropical Depression Three formed six days after the previous one dissipated. Moving west-northwest, it peaked at 35 mph (55 km/h). On June 20, it dissipated.\n\nTropical Depression Six developed on July 13 about southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The depression had same peak intensity as Three and had dissipated on July 17. According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on July 18 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline, and two days later it exited CPHC's area of responsibility; however, this storm was not included into CPHC database. As it entered into western Pacific, it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name \"Wynne\". The final tropical cyclone developed at 1800 UTC November 24 around southwest of Baja California Sur. A very weak cyclone, the depression dissipated on November 25, ending the above-average season.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1987. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 1993 season. This is the same list used for the 1981 season. However, the names Xina, York, and Zelda were added to name lists for odd-numbered years sometime after 1985 due to that year's season threatening to exhaust the list. Storms were named Pilar and Ramon for the first time in 1987, as the name Selma had been used on the older lists.\n\nTwo names from the Central Pacific list were used – Oka and Peke. This was the first usage for both names.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization retired one Eastern Pacific name in the spring of 1992: Knut. It was replaced in the 1993 season by Kenneth.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187945", "title": "1986 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1986 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1986 Pacific hurricane season saw several tropical cyclones contribute to significant flooding to the Central United States. The hurricane season officially started May 15, 1986, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1986 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1986 in both regions. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. A total of 17 named storms and 9 hurricanes developed during the season; this is slightly above the averages of 15 named storms and 8 hurricanes, respectively. In addition, 26 tropical depressions formed in the eastern Pacific during 1986, which, at the time, was the second most ever recorded; only the 1982 Pacific hurricane season saw a higher total.\n\nSeveral storms throughout the season affected land. Hurricane Estelle passed south of Hawaii, resulting in $2 million in damage and two deaths. Hurricanes Newton, Paine and Roslyn each struck Northwestern Mexico. While damage was minimal from these three systems near their location of landfall, Paine brought considerable flooding to the Great Plains. The overall flooding event resulted in $350 million in damage, with the worst effects being recorded in Oklahoma. Hurricane Roslyn was the strongest storm of the season, attaining peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h).\n\nActivity in the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center's (EPHC) area of responsibility was above average. There were 25 tropical depressions, one short of the record set in 1982, which had 26. Only one storm formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility, Tropical Depression One-C. Six other cyclones entered the CPHC area of responsibility from the EPHC area of responsibility. In all, 17 systems formed, which is two storms above normal. In addition, 9 hurricanes were reported during the season, one more than average. An average number (3) of major hurricanes – Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale – was also reported.\n\nThe season began with the formation of Hurricane Agatha on May 22 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Twenty Five on October 25, spanning 147 days. Although it was nearly two weeks shorter than the 1985 Pacific hurricane season, the season was six days longer than average. The EPHC issued 406 tropical cyclone advisories, which were issued four times a day at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. In 1986, Hurricane Hunters flew into three storms; Newton, Roslyn, and Estelle. In Newton, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducted environmental research in the cyclone. In addition, the National Weather Service Field Service Station provided the East Pacific with excellent satellite coverage.\n\nDuring the months of May and June, four named systems developed. In July, one tropical storm and two hurricanes formed. The following month, five tropical systems developed. Towards the end of the season, tropical cyclone activity declined somewhat. While five storms formed in September, only one formed in October and none during the month of November. A moderate El Nino was present throughout the season; water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific were 1.3 °C (3 °F) above normal. In addition, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period.\n\nThree tropical cyclones made landfall in 1986. The first, Hurricane Newton made landfall near Cabo San Lucas, bringing minor damage. Another storm, Hurricane Paine brushed Cabo San Lucas, and later moved inland over Sonora. Paine caused minimal impacts at landfall, but its remnants were described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history. Flooding affected 52 counties in Oklahoma, which resulted in a total of $350 million in damage. The final storm to make landfall during the hurricane season was Hurricane Roslyn. The hurricane produced some flooding, but no serious damage. In addition, Hurricane Estelle came close enough to Hawaii to require a hurricane watch. Two drownings were reported, and the total damage was around $2 million.\n\nThe 1986 Pacific hurricane season's first tropical disturbance formed from the tip of Baja California Sur on May 20. By 0000 UTC May 22, the circulation began to tighten and become more organized, and thus the EPHC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Depression One-E that morning. Approximately 48 hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Agatha, the first storm of the season. After moving southeast, the cyclone made an abrupt change in direction, turning towards the north. Agatha strengthened into a hurricane on May 25 near the coast of Mexico, reaching its peak intensity of 75 mph (115 km/h). Turning southeast, the system quickly weakened into a tropical depression, but regained tropical storm strength on May 28, only to dissipate that day. Rainfall spread around both the Atlantic and Pacific Mexican coasts, peaking at at Xicotepec de Juarez, Puebla.\n\nA tropical disturbance formed on May 30 in the eastern Gulf of Tehuantepec. The disturbance was moving very slowly when it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Two-E on May 31. The depression began to weaken six hours later and the final advisory by the EPHC was released on June 1. Most of Mexico received rainfall, with over falling on Yucatán Peninsula. The worst rain occurred in Central Mexico, where over of precipitation fell, peaking at in Tenosique, Tabasco. The rest of the country was hit by of rainfall.\n\nA tropical disturbance originated from the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June 16. The disturbance moved west-northwest at below a weak upper-level high, becoming the third tropical depression of the 1986 season on June 17. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Blas the next day. It kept that strength for only six hours, weakening into a depression again as it moved into cooler waters. After Blas's convection dissipated, the EPHC ceased advisories on June 19 while situated roughly south of Cabo San Lucas.\n\nOn June 24, five days after Tropical Storm Blas dissipated, a tropical disturbance developed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, its circulation had become well-defined enough for the EPHC to upgrade the disturbance into Tropical Depression Four. Winds reached 40 mph (65 km/h), enough to upgrade the system into Tropical Storm Celia on June 26. While located off the coast of Mexico, Celia strengthened into a hurricane at 1800 UTC June 27. An eye became evident on satellite imagery and the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) on June 28 at 1600 UTC. Hurricane Celia then passed by Socorro Island. Meanwhile, Celia moved into much cooler water which enabled the hurricane to weaken rapidly. By June 30, Celia had become a tropical depression. The EPHC released its final advisory at 1800 UTC that day as the system was dissipating.\n\nThe fifth tropical cyclone of the season formed as a tropical disturbance on July 2. Moving northwest at about , the disturbance entered warmer waters and strengthening rapidly. The disturbance was upgraded into Tropical Depression Five at 1800 UTC July 3. Turning west-northwest, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Darby on July 5. Darby peaked at 40 mph (60 km/h). The stormed continued northwest for about six hours, when it reached waters and began a weakening trend. Clouds spread northward over the US states of Arizona and California on July 6. The cyclone dissipated on July 7.\nDuring the afternoon of July 16, a tropical depression formed thousands of miles west of Mexico, and within 12 hours it strengthened into a tropical storm. On July 18, Estelle intensified into a hurricane. Located in a favorable environment, Estelle continued strengthening to become the first major hurricane of the season on July 20. The hurricane entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility near its peak strength of 135 mph (215 km/h), a Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane veered to the west and passed south of Hawaii. Estelle weakened to a tropical storm on July 23, and on July 25, it weakened to a depression. The storm dissipated two days later.\n\nIn advance of Hurricane Estelle, the National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch and high-surf advisory for the Island of Hawaii. More than 200 people evacuated from their homes. Huge waves crashed on the shores of the Big Island on the afternoon of July 22. The high waves washed away five beachfront homes and severely damaged dozens of others on the beach resort of Vacation Land. The total damage was around $2 million (1986 US$; $  USD). However, only two deaths reported from the storm, both of whom drowned offshore Oahu.\n\nThe EPHC began monitoring a tropical disturbance located southwest of San Salvador on 1800 UTC July 23. About 24 hours later, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression. Initially moving towards the west-northwest due to an upper-level low and a ridge over Mexico, the storm then turned to the west as the upper-level low changed direction. By July 28, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Frank. After turning back to the west-northwest, Frank reached hurricane intensity early on July 30. The storm quickly developed a well-defined eye and three hours later, Hurricane Frank reached its peak intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, with winds of . Hurricane Frank maintained this intensity for 18 hours. Subsequently, the hurricane began to rapidly weaken over sea surface temperatures. Wind shear soon increased, thus accelerating the weakening process. On July 31, Frank was reduced to tropical storm intensity. Not long after weakening into a depression, the storm entered the CPHC's area of responsibility. Wind shear increased further, and upon entering the region, Frank moved over slightly cooler water. It transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 3.\n\nOn August 3, a tropical depression developed in the open ocean over west of the Mexican coastline. Twelve hours later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Georgette before weakening to a depression on August 4. It then accelerated to a very rapid speed of 23–45 mph (37–75 km/h). Due to its fast speed, Georgette could not maintain a closed circulation, and thus degenerated into a non-cyclonic disturbance on August 4. The disturbance kept up its rapid forward motion, crossed the dateline and entered the western Pacific, where it reformed and reached its peak intensity as Severe Tropical Storm Georgette. By August 16, Georgette merged with another system.\n\nA tropical wave crossed Southwestern Mexico and Belize in mid-August. A tropical disturbance developed from this wave south of Acapulco on August 15, the same day that the system moved offshore. Moving west-northwest south of an upper-level high, the system was classified as a tropical depression the next day about south of Manzanillo. Several hours later, the depression reached tropical storm intensity. Turning towards the northwest due to a trough, it failed to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength. Passing south of the Baja California Peninsula, the storm rapidly moved over cooler waters. Howard weakened into a tropical depression at 0600 UTC August 18. Transversing water, Howard dissipated. Rainfall along the southern coast reached in some places, with totals in excess of in isolated locations. Further north, rainfall was more scattered. The maximum rainfall was in Reforma, near the southern part of the country.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed south of Socorro Island at 1800 UTC August 18. Twenty-four hours later the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on August 19. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Isis the next day. After peaking as a moderate tropical storm at 1200 UTC August 23, Isis weakened into a depression over waters early on August 24. While located some west of the Mexican coast, the tropical cyclone dissipated later that day.\n\nOn August 19, a tropical disturbance formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec and south of Cabo San Lucas. Satellite imagery began to show signs of developing a circulation, and the disturbance became a tropical depression on August 20 and intensified into Tropical Storm Javier hours later. Southwest of a ridge, Javier began to turn towards the west-northwest. Despite an increase in forward speed, Tropical Storm Javier underwent rapid intensification, reaching hurricane intensity at 0900 UTC August 21. About three hours later, Javier reached Category 2 strength, and briefly became a major hurricane on August 22, only to rapidly weaken back to a Category 1 hurricane late on August 23. Hurricane Javier sharply turned towards the north and eventually towards the northwest. Early on August 24, Javier resumed intensification, regaining Category 3 intensity at 0600 UTC. Passing midway between Socorro Island and Clarion Island, the storm reached its peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h). Moving beneath the ridge, Hurricane Javier turned to the west and subsequently weakened back into a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nAfter briefly re-intensifying into a Category 4, the storm resumed weakening due to increasing wind shear, and by late on August 25, Hurricane Javier had weakened directly into a Category 2 hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Javier was downgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. While it managed to maintain marginal hurricane intensity for 24 hours. on 1200 UTC August 28, the EPHC announced that Javier had weakened back into a tropical storm. Shortly after that, Javier turned towards the west-northwest due an upper-level trough. Now over waters, the system continued to weaken as wind shear increased further. On August 30, Javier weakened into a depression and dissipated the next day over southwest of Southern California. Waves were 15 ft (4.6 m) high in some areas, prompting meteorologists to issue a high surf advisory. Hurricane Javier brought the highest waves of the summer to southern California.\n\nIn late August, a tropical disturbance formed east-southeast of Hurricane Javier and nearly south of the Baja California Peninsula. Moving slowly west, the disturbance began to develop a well-defined circulation, and was respectively upgraded into a tropical depression on August 28. Passing 10 mi (20 km) south of Clarion Island, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Kay. The cyclone's forward speed increased; subsequently, Kay reached its peak intensity. After maintaining its intensity for 18 hours, Kay rapidly weakened over cold water, and was downgraded into a depression at 0000 UTC September 2. Kay dissipated the next day several hundred miles west of the Baja California Peninsula.\n\nA westward-moving tropical wave increased in thunderstorm activity, soon organizing into a tropical depression on September 13. At the time of the upgrade, Lester was located more than west of the Mexican coast. Moving towards the west, the depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Lester. After turning towards the west-northwest, Lester peaked in intensity as a moderate tropical storm. Due to a combination of strong wind shear and cold water, Lester began a slow weakening trend. While entering the CPHC's area of responsibility at 1800 UTC September 17, Lester had already weakened to a tropical depression. Unable to maintain a closed circulation, the final advisory was issued.\n\nA tropical disturbance first developed during September 13 and September 14 over the warm waters south of Acapulco. On September 15, the EPHC first classified the system as a tropical depression. Rapidly moving towards the west, the depression was embedded in deep easterly flow. The system attained tropical storm intensity on 1800 UTC September 16, thus received the name Madeline. After turning towards the west-northwest, Tropical Storm Madeline accelerated. It began a slow intensification trend, and peaked as a high-end tropical storm on 0600 UTC September 18. An upper-level low introduced strong wind shear, and Madeline began to fall apart almost immediately thereafter. After turning towards the north, and slowing down, Madeline dissipated on September 22.\nA tropical disturbance became a tropical depression on September 18. Intensification was slow as the depression did not reach storm status until September 20. Paralleling the coast, Newton steadily intensified. Newton strengthened into a hurricane on September 21. On September 22, Newton slammed into Cabo San Lucas, and after entering the Gulf of California, Hurricane Newton attained its peak intensity 85 mph (140 km/h). Shortly after that, Newton moved inland into the mainland of Mexico. Over land, Newton dissipated on September 23.\n\nUpon making landfall on the Baja California Peninsula, moderate rainfall was recorded. After the hurricane's second landfall, damage was also minor, though 40 roofs were ripped off of homes; trees and utility poles were also downed due to high winds. However, no injuries or fatalities were reported in association with Newton. Newton's remnants later combined with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall that downed power lines in Kansas City, leaving 20,000 customers without power.\n\nHurricane Orlene originated from a stationary tropical disturbance that was upgraded into a tropical depression on September 21. Despite a poorly defined circulation, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Orlene 12 hours after formation. Steadily gaining strength, Orlene reached hurricane intensity on September 22. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane entered the CPHC's area of responsibility. Upon the formation of an eye, Orlene reached its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h). After maintaining peak intensity for 24 hours, Hurricane Orlene began to encounter strong wind shear. Subsequently, Orlene weakened rapidly and lost hurricane status at 1800 UTC September 23. The system weakened into a tropical depression on September 24. Tropical Depression Orlene dissipated the next day.\nA tropical disturbance developed on September 27 within of the Mexican coastline. The disturbance was upgraded into Tropical Depression Twenty-Three on 0000 UTC September 28. Tropical Depression Twenty-Three moved west-northwestward, lured poleward by an upper-level trough near northern Mexico. At 0000 UTC September 30, the depression became Tropical Storm Paine, southwest of Acapulco. Roughly 21 hours later, a NOAA Hurricane Hunter flight found winds of 90 mph (145 km/h), upgrading Paine into hurricane. The hurricane peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on October 1 as it turned northwest, headed towards the Gulf of California. Hurricane Paine did not intensify further due to the presence of mid-level wind shear and dry air. The outer eyewall moved across Cabo San Lucas, and the resultant land interaction was believed to have slightly weakened the inner core of the hurricane. Paine moved ashore near San José, Sonora with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). The storm weakened as it moved over land going through Mexico and then entering the United States. Paine dissipated on October 4 over Lake Michigan.\n\nRainfall from the tropical cyclone was significant in Mexico and the United States. Light rain fell in Cabo San Lucas. Meanwhile, rains around the Mexican Mainland peaked at 12 in (300 mm) in Acapulco. Near the area around where it made landfall, strong winds knocked down trees and caused disruptions to city services. In the United States, rainfall peaked at in Fort Scott, Kansas. The Barnsdall, Oklahoma weather station recorded 10.42 inches (26.5 cm) on September 29, which set a record for the highest daily precipitation for any station statewide. The flooding affected 52 counties in Oklahoma, which resulted in a total of $350 million in damage. In all, Paine was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history. Flooding from Paine resulted in about 1,200 people homeless in East Saint Louis, Illinois and resulted in record discharge rates along many streams and creeks. Subsequently, many reservoirs were nearly filled to its capacity. For example, the Mississippi River in St. Louis reached the fifth highest flood stage on record.\n\nA tropical disturbance moved westward offshore Nicaragua and was declared Tropical Depression Twenty-Four on October 15.. During the early afternoon of the next day, ship reports indicated the formation of a tropical depression close to land. The cyclone moved at a quick pace towards the west-northwest south of a warm-core ridge. Early on the morning on October 16, Roslyn became a tropical storm. By the morning of the October 17, Roslyn had developed into a hurricane south of Acapulco. A vigorous upper trough was deepening offshore Baja California, and Roslyn began to re-curve within a few hundred miles of Manzanillo. The system struck Mazatlán as a marginal hurricane on October 20. The low-level center rapidly dissipated, although a frontal low developed in the western Gulf of Mexico, which moved over southeastern Texas and later through the Mississippi Valley. The original upper-level circulation maintained its northeast movement, bringing rainfall to the Southeastern United States.\n\nAffecting a sparsely-populated area, the highest reported winds from a land station were . Roslyn produced some flooding, but no serious damage. Impact was limited to flooded homes and factories, as well as some crop damage and beach erosion and only one yacht sunk. The remnants of Hurricane Roslyn produced heavy rainfall across the central and southern United States. In Matagorda, Texas, a total of was reported.\nIn addition to the 17 named storms, there were eight tropical depressions during the season that failed to reach tropical storm strength. The second, Tropical Depression Seven, began as a large area of thunderstorms near Hurricane Estelle on July 17. Moving at a steady pace, the cyclone failed to intensify and attained peak intensity of 30 mph (50 km/h). Cool sea surface temperatures and its proximity to Hurricane Estelle eventually caused the depression to dissipate late on July 18.\n\nTropical Depression Eight formed on July 21 while located southwest of the Baja California Peninsula. Initially moving west-northwest around an upper-level high, the depression peaked with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). It dissipated on July 24. Another tropical disturbance formed on July 24. A circulation developed two days later, and thus it was classified as Tropical Depression Ten. The cyclone remained a tropical depression for about three days before moving into the CPHC's area of responsibility on 1000 UTC July 27. A slow weakening trend began as the depression continued to move west at speeds of 30 mph (45 km/h). By 1800 UTC on July 29, it had become poorly organized around west-southwest of the Hawaiian Islands, and the final advisory was issued.\n\nTropical Depression One-C formed on July 27, possibly from the remnants of Tropical Depression Eight that dissipated a few days earlier well to the east of 140 °W. The depression tracked westward at a fairly rapid forward speed of 35 mph (55 km/h); however, it failed to develop past the depression stage. One-C passed well south of the Hawaiian Islands on July 28. On July 29 at 0000 UTC, it had dissipated to the southwest of the Hawaiian Islands and the final advisory was issued by the CPHC.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather developed a circulation on August 12 and was upgraded into Tropical Depression Twelve nearly south of the Baja California Peninsula. It drifted slowly to the northwest until it dissipated near 22 °N 110 °W on August 14. Peak maximum sustained winds were estimated at 35 mph (55 km/h). Tropical Depression Seventeen formed on September 8, east of Socorro Island and dissipated on September 9 over cold water without becoming a tropical storm.\n\nOne of the last cyclones of the season formed from a westward-moving tropical disturbance in the ITCZ. The disturbance moved at about and upon developing a circulation, was declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One at 0600 UTC September 19. However the depression lasted for only six hours before dissipating, likely due to the close distance between it and Tropical Storm Madeline. Tropical Depression Twenty-Five was the final tropical depression of the 1986 season. It formed on October 22 at 1800 UTC near the 140°W line. Due to strong wind shear, the stationary storm had dissipated within 30 hours of formation. Even though no more official systems developed, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked that an unnamed tropical storm may have formed in November.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1986. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1992 season. This is the same list used for the 1980 season. A storm was named Paine for the first time in 1986, while Orlene and Roslyn were previously used on the old four-year lists. No central Pacific names were used; the first name used would have been Oka. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.\n\n\n"}

Wentworth Jr. Florida State Museum is a museum of history located at 330 Jefferson Street in the Plaza Ferdinand VII in Pensacola, Florida. It is part of the Historic Pensacola Village museum complex. The building, reminiscent of the Alamo mission style, was built in 1907 as the Pensacola City Hall and served as such until 1985 when the present city hall was built at 180 Governmental Center, also known as 222 West Main Street. In 1989, the building was listed as the Pensacola City Hall in \"A Guide to Florida's Historic Architecture\", published by the University of Florida Press.\n\nWentworth opened his first museum as a roadside stand in the suburb of Ensley in 1957, and continued to collect items of interest. His curiosity spanned a wide range of materials. In the 1980s, Wentworth said he would donate his entire collection to the city if it provided a permanent location in Pensacola. A state grant was signed by Governor Bob Martinez to enable the city to renovate the former city hall for this purpose, as the city had completed a new facility in 1985. \n\nThe museum was officially opened in 1988. One floor is dedicated to Wentworth's eccentric collections, which include a mummified cat, among other items. The other two floors illustrate and interpret life in the Florida Panhandle over the centuries; some of the artifacts are from Wentworth's collection. The other floors house a science interactive museum for children.\n\nFrom September 2004 to March 2005, the museum was closed for renovations after Hurricane Ivan caused considerable damage to the property. When the museum opened again, a new exhibit was added, comparing and contrasting the effects of the 2004 hurricane to the 1926 hurricane that had damaged the building.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187958", "title": "The New School", "text": "The New School\n\nThe New School is a private research university in New York City. It was founded in 1919 as The New School for Social Research with an original mission dedicated to academic freedom and intellectual inquiry and a home for progressive thinkers. Since then, the school has grown to house five divisions within the university. These include the Parsons School of Design, the Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts, The New School for Social Research, the Schools of Public Engagement, the College of Performing Arts which consists of the Mannes School of Music, the School of Drama, and the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. In addition, the university maintains the Parsons Paris campus and has also launched or housed a range of institutions, such as the international research institute World Policy Institute, the Philip Glass Institute, the Vera List Center for Art and Politics, the India China Institute, the Observatory on Latin America, and the Center for New York City Affairs.\n\nIts faculty and alumni include numerous notable designers, writers, musicians, artists, and political activists. Approximately 10,000 students are enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate programs and disciplines including social sciences, liberal arts, humanities, architecture, fine arts, design, music, drama, finance, psychology, and public policy.\n\nFrom its founding in 1919 by progressive New York educators, and for most of its history, the university was known as The New School for Social Research. Between 1997 and 2005 it was known as New School University. The university and each of its colleges were renamed in 2005.\n\nThe New School established the University in Exile and the École libre des hautes études in 1933 as a graduate division to serve as an academic haven for scholars escaping from Nazi Germany among other adversarial regimes in Europe. In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.\n\nThe New School for Social Research was founded by a group of university professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where adult students could \"seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working\". Founders included economist and literary scholar Alvin Johnson, historian Charles A. Beard, economists Thorstein Veblen and James Harvey Robinson, and philosophers Horace M. Kallen and John Dewey. Several founders were former professors at Columbia University.\n\nIn October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a loyalty oath to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. Charles A. Beard, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School.\n\nThe New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of postgraduate education without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains. The first classes at the New School took the form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for \"those equipped for specific research\". In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included Thomas Sewall Adams, Charles A. Beard, Horace M. Kallen, Harold Laski, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, Graham Wallas, Charles B. Davenport, Elsie Clews Parsons, and Roscoe Pound. John Cage later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school.\n\nThe New School uses \"To the Living Spirit\" as its motto. In 1937, Thomas Mann remarked that a plaque bearing the inscription \"be the Living Spirit\" had been torn down by the Nazis from a building at the University of Heidelberg. He suggested that the University in Exile adopt that inscription as its motto, to indicate that the 'living spirit,' mortally threatened in Europe, would have a home in this country. Alvin Johnson adopted that idea, and the motto continues to guide the division in its present-day endeavors\n\nThe Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science was founded in 1933 as the University in Exile for scholars who had been dismissed from teaching positions by the Italian fascists or had to flee Nazi Germany. The University in Exile was initially founded by the director of the New School, Alvin Johnson, through the financial contributions of Hiram Halle and the Rockefeller Foundation. The University in Exile and its subsequent incarnations have been the intellectual heart of the New School. Notable scholars associated with the University in Exile include psychologists Erich Fromm, Max Wertheimer and Aron Gurwitsch, political theorists Hannah Arendt and Leo Strauss, and philosopher Hans Jonas.\n\nIn 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005 the Graduate Faculty was again renamed, this time taking the original name of the university, The New School for Social Research.\n\nThe New School played a similar role with the founding of the École Libre des Hautes Études after the Nazi invasion of France. Receiving a charter from de Gaulle's Free French government in exile, the École attracted refugee scholars who taught in French, including philosopher Jacques Maritain, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, and linguist Roman Jakobson. The \"École Libre\" gradually evolved into one of the leading institutions of research in Paris, the \"École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales\", with which the New School maintains close ties.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1949, The New School included the \"Dramatic Workshop,\" a groundbreaking theater education program and predecessor of School of Drama that was founded by German emigrant theatre director Erwin Piscator. Important acting teachers during this period were Stella Adler and Elia Kazan. Among the famous students of the Dramatic Workshop were Beatrice Arthur, Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Ben Gazzara, Michael V. Gazzo, Rod Steiger, Elaine Stritch, Shelley Winters and Tennessee Williams.\n\nThe New School for Social Research continues the Graduate Faculty's tradition of synthesizing liberalism, American intellectual thought, and critical European philosophy. True to its origin and its firm roots within the University in Exile, The New School for Social Research, particularly its Department of Philosophy, is in the minority in the United States in offering students thorough training in the modern continental European philosophical tradition known as \"Continental philosophy\". Thus, it stresses the teachings of Parmenides, Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Arendt, Freud, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, et al. The Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School (Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, et al.) exerts an especially strong influence on all divisions of the school. After the death of Hannah Arendt in 1975, the philosophy department revolved around Reiner Schürmann and Ágnes Heller, and it now boasts such noted philosophers as Richard J. Bernstein, Simon Critchley, and Alice Crary.\n\nThe New School is divided into autonomous colleges called \"divisions\". Each one is led by a dean and has its own scholarships, standards of admission, and acceptance rates.\n\nIn June 2005, the university was rebranded with a new logo and all schools were officially renamed to include \"The New School\" within their formal names.\n\nSome faculty, students, and alumni expressed concern over the rebranding of the university, and especially the dramatic redesign of the logo from a six-sided shield against a green background to a spray-painted graffiti mark reading simply, in capital letters, \"THE NEW SCHOOL\" with, in smaller letters beneath, \"A UNIVERSITY\". They claimed that the university's new identity campaign, while maintaining a slick urban edge, did little to suggest academic rigor or collegiate legacy.\n\nIn 2015 the New School rebranded using elements designed by Paula Scher of Pentagram using a bespoke font called \"Neue\".\n\nIn addition to the new logo, the school announced that it was combining Mannes College of Music, New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, and New School for Drama into a College of Performing Arts in fall 2015, relocating most of the performing arts to Arnhold Hall at 55 West 13th St., where the School of Jazz had occupied two floors since the early 90s.\n\nUnlike most U.S. universities, The New School has a \"student-directed curriculum\", which does not require its undergraduates to take general education courses. Instead, students are encouraged to explore before focusing on a major, selecting topics that are of interest to them. An exception to this is in the performing arts, where students must declare majors at enrollment. Although all \"New Schoolers\" are required to complete rigorous core training—usually of a literary, conservatory, or artistic nature—students are expected to be the primary designer of their own individualized and eclectic education.\n\nThe New School's curriculum is highly experimental and avant-garde, offering classes such as: \"Heterodox Identities\", \"Games 101\", \"NYC: Graphic Gotham\", \"Artist as Activist\", \"Masculinity in Asia\", \"Queer Culture\", \"John Zorn's COBRA,\" \"John Cage Song Books,\" and \"Play and Toil in the Digital Sweatshop\". The New School also offers a course titled \"Social Media: The Power to Speak the Truth\". The course explores the transformative history of the Internet and provides a working knowledge of the tools it offers for journalism and public action.\n\nThe university offers 81 degree/diploma programs and majors, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1. This small class size allows The New School to teach most of its classes in the seminar style—especially at Eugene Lang College, which consistently ranks at the top of The Princeton Review's \"class discussions encouraged\" national listing.\n\nThe university offers a range of dual degree programs. These include a bachelor of arts & bachelor of fine arts (colloquially called the \"BA/FA pathway\") program or a bachelor of arts & masters program. The former is a comprehensive five-year program that allows students to obtain their B.A. from Eugene Lang College and their B.F.A. from either Parsons or The School of Jazz and Contemporary Music.\n\nThe latter is also a five-year program that allows students at Eugene Lang to obtain their masters from the New School For Social Research. Another recent addition is the Master of Arts Management and Entrepreneurship program, which can be obtained along with either a Bachelor of Music (Mannes) or a Bachelor of Fine Arts (Drama or Jazz) in five-years.\n\nThere are several important institutes and research centers at The New School which are focused on various study fields. Their work is concentrated in the following areas:\n\nThe New School's College of Performing Arts is home to the legendary experimental music venue, The Stone, offering 240 concerts a year.\n\n33% of New School students are international, with 112 foreign countries being represented at the university. U.S. students come from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 43% of them are people of color, and 5% of American students identify as more than one race. Of the entire student population, 63% receive financial aid, and 17% study abroad before graduating.\n\nThe New School's campus is composed of many buildings, most of which are minutes from Union Square.\n\nThe university's Parsons division also has affiliations with schools that operate independently but embrace Parsons' philosophy and teaching methodology, including Parsons Paris in France, India School of Design and Innovation in Mumbai, and La Escuela de Diseño at Altos de Chavón in La Romana, Dominican Republic.\n\nThe New School opened the 16-story University Center (\"UC\") at 65 5th Avenue in January 2014.\n\nWhile the 65 Fifth Avenue plans were initially controversial among students and Village residents (spurring in 2009 a major student occupation was held at The New School's previous building on that site), plans for the University Center were adjusted in response to community concerns and have since been well received. In a review of the University Center's final design, \"The New York Times\" architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff called the building \"a celebration of the cosmopolitan city\".\n\nThe UC serves as a central hub for all university students. The tower, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's Roger Duffy, is the biggest capital project the university has ever undertaken. The building added classrooms, new residences, computer labs, event facilities, and a cafeteria to the downtown New York City campus in addition to a library, and lecture hall.\n\nSeveral of the university buildings are certified by New York City as historical landmarks. Prominent among these is the egg-shaped Tishman Auditorium, considered by many to be the first building to employ modern architecture. It was designed by architect Joseph Urban, along with the entirety of The New School's historic 66 West 12th Street building. Thousands of writer's forums, author visits, political debates, award ceremonies, academic lectures, performances, and public hearings are held for both the academic community and general public throughout the year in Tishman.\n\nNewer buildings have garnered a multitude of awards. Among these is The Sheila Johnson Design Center, which attracted media attention for its revolutionary design. In 2009, it won the SCUP's Excellence in Architecture Renovation/Adaptive Reuse Award. In addition to being a Parsons core academic building, the Center also serves as a public art gallery. The New School Welcome Center, located on 13th Street and Fifth Avenue, won the American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter's Interiors Merit Award in 2010. In October 2019, the university celebrated its centennial with \"The Festival of New.\" \n\nThe New School owns several libraries throughout New York City and is a member of the Research Library Association of South Manhattan. In 2009, its libraries counted a total of 1,906,046 holdings.\n\nIn 1931 the New School commissioned two mural cycles: José Clemente Orozco's \"A Call for Revolution\" and \"Universal Brotherhood\" and Thomas Hart Benton's epic America Today. The New School Art Collection was established in 1960 with a grant from the Albert A. List Foundation. The collection, now grown to approximately 1,800 postwar and contemporary works of art, includes examples in almost all media. Parts of it are exhibited throughout the campus. Notable artists such as Andy Warhol, Kara Walker, Richard Serra, and Sol LeWitt all have pieces displayed in New School's academic buildings.\n\nThe New School publishes the following journals:\n\n\nThe New School houses over 50 recognized student organizations, most of which are geared towards artistic endeavors or civic engagement. Notable among these are The Theatre Collective, which stages numerous dramatic productions throughout the year, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the New School Debate Team (intercollegiate competition in Policy/Cross Examination style debate), ReNew School (sustainability and environmental advocacy group) Moxie (feminist alliance), the New Urban Grilling Society (NUGS), and The Radical Student Union (RSU).\n\nA noted student newspaper, \"The New School Free Press\", also known as \"NSFP\" is widely distributed throughout the campus. Hard print copies are available in most academic buildings, while an online edition is available as well. Students at Eugene Lang College publishes \"Release\", a student-run literary magazine.\n\nWNSR, a student-run, faculty-advised online-only radio station, also operates at the university. Programming is currently delivered in the form of streamable mp3s and, in the near future, subscribable podcasts. It is a station for all divisions of The New School.\n\nFormer Athletics and Recreation Director Diane Yee joined The New School in August 2012. On October 25, 2012 a school-wide election was held to select a mascot, where The New School Narwhals were born. On January 25, 2013 the athletics logo was launched, designed by Parsons’ student Matthew Wolff (Graphic Design '14).\n\nThe department began in December 2008 under its original name Recreation and Intramural sports. The initial director, Michael McQuarrie, held the position for four years. He built a relationship with the McBurney YMCA where intramurals continue to be held on Wednesday nights and created the ongoing New School Olympics and charitable 5K Turkey Trot.\n\nThe Narwhals feature several intercollegiate teams: basketball (2009), cross country (2010), cycling (2013), soccer (2013), tennis (2014), ultimate Frisbee (2014). The New School Narwhals are an independent school, unaffiliated with the NCAA, but regularly compete against NCAA Division III schools.\n\nBasketball – competes regularly against Cooper Union, Culinary Institute of America, Pratt Institute, and Vaughn College\n\nCross Country – competes in CUNYAC and HVIAC conference invitationals as an unaffiliated school\n\nCycling – a member of the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Conference\n\nSoccer – competes against Cooper Union, Culinary Institute of America, St. Joseph's College, and Vaughn College\n\nIn addition to sports, the recreation department offers a myriad of free fitness classes to its community including boxing, dance, HIIT, Pilates, tai chi, yoga, and Zumba. Personal training is also offered at an affordable rate ranging from $16.50 to $40 per session.\n\nOutdoor Adventure trips are offered several times/week and what started to be wilderness in nature (camping, hiking, rafting) has expanded to include excursions such as archery, biking, horseback riding, skiing/snowboarding, surfing, rock climbing and trapeze.\n\nYee has increased programming to include a second charitable race that takes place annually in April called the 5K Rabbit Run. She has also started the Urban Hunt (a scavenger hunt around campus and the Village) and Club New (a dance party for first-year students the weekend before first day of classes).\n\n\nThe psychology department at The New School has had issues with sexual harassment. According to a December 2017 account in the \"Stanford Daily\", Marcel Kinsbourne retired after being investigated by the school's Title IX office for sexual harassment of several students. In the fall of 2017, another professor in the same division, Emanuele Castano, left the New School under the same conditions. In April 2018, a former undergraduate student filed a lawsuit against the school over the school's conduct regarding Castano's behavior.\n\nIn May 2010 The New School was found liable for sexual harassment and retaliation endured by a freshman student employee. The case was Zakrzewska v The New School, 2010 NY Slip Op 03796, and in it, the New York Court of Appeals found that the typical defense of an employer against a sexual harassment suit (called the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense) was not applicable under New York City Human Rights Law.\n\nHistorically, The New School has been associated with leftist politics, campus activism, civic engagement, and social change. It is a \"Periclean University\", or member Project Pericles, meaning that it teaches \"education for social responsibility and participatory citizenship as an essential part of their educational programs, in the classroom, on the campus, and in the community\". The New School is one of nine American universities to be inducted into Ashoka's \"Changemaker\" consortium for social entrepreneurship.\n\nIn 2010, NYC Service awarded New School special recognition in The College Challenge, a volunteer initiative, for the \"widest array of [civic] service events both on and off campus\". Miriam Weinstein also cites the Eugene Lang division in her book, \"Making a Difference Colleges: Distinctive Colleges to Make a Better World\".\n\nFormer U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey became president of The New School in 2000. Kerrey drew praise and criticism for his streamlining of the university, as well as censure for his support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, generally opposed by the university's faculty.\n\nIn 2004, Kerrey appointed Arjun Appadurai as provost. Appadurai resigned as provost in early 2006, but retained a tenured faculty position. He was succeeded by Joseph W. Westphal, yet on December 8, 2008 Kerrey announced that Westphal was stepping down to accept a position in President Barack Obama's Department of Defense transition team. Kerrey then took the highly unorthodox step of appointing himself to the provost position while remaining president. This decision was strongly criticised by faculty and other members of the university community as a power-grab involving potential conflicts of interest. This was seen as a threat to scholarly integrity since the role of provost in overseeing the academic functions of a university has traditionally been insulated from fundraising and other responsibilities of a college president. After a series of rifts including protests involving student occupations of university buildings, Kerrey later appointed Tim Marshall, Dean of Parsons School of Design, as Interim Provost through June 2011. Marshall has since been reappointed in this role.\n\nOn December 10, 2008, 74 of the New School's senior professors gave a vote of no confidence for the New School's former president, Bob Kerrey. By December 15, 98% of the university's full-time faculty had voted no confidence.\n\nOn December 17, over 100 students barricaded themselves in at a dining hall on the campus while hundreds more waited on the streets outside. They considered the current school administration opaque and harmful. Their chief demand, among others, was that Bob Kerrey resign. The students soon enlarged their occupied area, blocking security and police from entering the building. At 3 AM the next morning, the students left the building after Kerrey agreed to some of their demands (the most important elements on their first list of demands were not agreed to), including increased study space and amnesty from any actions performed during the protest. He did not, however, concede to resignation. In total, the occupation lasted 30 hours.\n\nIn January 2009, a student organization called The New School In Exile issued a public threat to shut down the university on April 1, unless the President and Chief Operating Officer were removed. They subsequently stole an entire edition of the student newspaper, after the paper published an article revealing their plans and names, and defaced the university's presidential residence. \n\nOn April 10, 2009, students, mostly from New School but also from other New York colleges, reoccupied the building at 65 Fifth Avenue, this time holding the entire building for about six hours. Once again, the students demanded the resignation of Bob Kerrey. The New York Police Department arrested the occupiers; the New School students involved were then suspended.\n\nOn May 7, 2009, Kerrey announced he would fulfill his presidency at the university through the end of his term and expressed his intent to leave office in June 2011. However, he ended up resigning a semester early, on January 1, 2011.\n\nOn August 26, 2010, a letter was sent out stating that the board of trustees had approved the appointment of Dr. David E. Van Zandt, who succeeded Bob Kerrey and become the 8th president of the New School.\n\nCurrently, The Princeton Review gives the university a sustainability rating of 94 out of 99. In 2010, the organization also named The New School one of America's \"286 Green Colleges\". The New School has a student-led environment and sustainability group, called Renew School, as well as full-time employees devoted to the school's sustainability. The university signed the Presidents' Climate Commitment and PlaNYC. The institution's sustainability website outlines many goals and projects for the future which will hopefully help The New School receive a good rating in the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card. The New School had the lowest reported carbon footprint of any college and university submitting inventories under the Green Report Card program, totaling about 1.0 metric tons CO2 per student. Subsequently, with the completion of the LEED certified but large University Center, The New School's carbon footprint increased to about 1.5 metric tons.\n\nIn 2003, adjunct faculty in several divisions of the New School began to form a labor union chapter under the auspices of the United Auto Workers. Though the university at first tried to contest the unionization, after several rulings against it by regional and national panels of the National Labor Relations Board the university recognized the local chapter, ACT-UAW, as the bargaining agent for the faculty. As a result of a near strike in November 2005 on the part of the adjunct faculty, the ACT-UAW union negotiated its first contract which included the acknowledgment of previously unrecognized part-time faculty at Mannes College The New School for Music. In October 2018, graduate students received a tentative union contract from the administration after months of negotiations.\n\nJohn McCain's speech at the graduation ceremony of 2006 generated a large amount of media attention, due to vocal student opposition in print, radio, and television media, and the speech of Jean Rohe, a graduating senior who spoke before McCain and directly confronted the controversy, saying that the senator \"does not reflect the values upon which the university was founded\".\n\nOn April 27, 2015, a group of students installed a featuring the statement \"Thank You Snowden\" in the New School University Center on Fifth Avenue. The action was a response to the current revisions of Section 215 of the , as well as other bills that ensure continued and far-reaching mass surveillance by the American government.\n\n\nAccording to the university's \"Quick Facts\" page, New School has a living alumni pool of over 56,000 and graduates live in 112 different countries.\n\n\n"}

The latter hospital network dissolved, transferring Centenary Hospital's administration to The Scarborough Hospital. The new network of the three hospitals was tentatively named Scarborough and Rouge Hospital. In 2018, it was officially named as the Scarborough Health Network.\n\nOn January 24, 2019, the Scarborough Health Network approved the closure of pediatrics and obstetrics services at the Birchmount Hospital. As of 2019, the hospital network plans to reduce the number of hospital sites from three to two by 2031. In the three expansion options, the Centenary Hospital is planned for renovation while both the General and Birchmount hospitals are alternatively considered for shut down as a new hospital will be built at a different site in Scarborough.

{"id": "2187982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187982", "title": "Jeff Francoeur", "text": "Jeff Francoeur\n\nJeffrey Braden Francoeur (; born January 8, 1984), nicknamed \"Frenchy\", is an American former professional baseball right fielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, Texas Rangers, Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies, and Miami Marlins. When his playing days ended, he became a broadcaster; Francoeur is currently the lead television analyst for Atlanta Braves games.\n\nA mid-season call-up for the Braves in 2005, he played in slightly fewer than half of his team's games that year and finished the season with impressive enough statistics to finish third in Rookie of the Year voting and a \"Sports Illustrated\" cover story declaring him \"The Natural\". While he never again had similarly strong statistics, he continued to have a productive career, playing for 11 more seasons as a journeyman outfielder for seven more teams before retiring after a short stint with the Marlins in 2016. Throughout his career, Francoeur was noted for his strong throwing arm in the outfield and his free-swinging tendencies in the batter's box. He won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award in .\n\nFrancoeur was selected by the Braves in the first round of the June 2002 MLB draft. A 4-star Defensive Back committed to Clemson, he chose to forego college to play baseball. After the draft, Francoeur was assigned to the team's advanced Rookie League club in Danville, Virginia, where he played 38 games and hit .327 with 8 home runs and 31 RBIs. Francoeur advanced steadily through the Braves minor league system, playing for Rome (Low A) in 2003, Myrtle Beach (High A) and Greenville (former AA) in 2004, and Mississippi (AA) in 2005.\n\nFrancoeur was a member of the Rome Braves inaugural season team which went on to win the 2003 South Atlantic League Championship. He led that team in home runs with 14.\n\nIn 2004, Francoeur was named the top prospect in the Braves organization by \"Baseball America\". He was a member of the Carolina League regular season and postseason All-Star team. In 2005, he was selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game before getting called up by Atlanta.\n\nIn March 2014, after he was released by the Cleveland Indians, Francoeur signed with the San Diego Padres and was sent to the El Paso Chihuahuas in Triple A. Francoeur's new teammates played an elaborate month-long prank on him by convincing him that pitcher Jorge Reyes was deaf. Reyes cooperated with the prank, maintaining the appearance of being deaf by not speaking or listening to music. Chihuahuas first baseman/outfielder Cody Decker made a short film about the prank. Sportswriter Peter Gammons called Decker \"My new favorite person.\"\n\nFrancoeur was promoted by Atlanta on July 6, 2005. He was part of a group of rookie players, nicknamed the \"Baby Braves\", that Atlanta called up from its minor league system during the 2005 season.\n\nFrancoeur made his MLB debut the following day when he started in right field against the Chicago Cubs in the second game of a double header. In the bottom of the eighth inning he hit a 3-run homer to center field, his first Major League hit. Francoeur is famous for his promise at the very beginning of his career: he made the cover of the edition of August 26, 2005 of \"Sports Illustrated\", who dubbed him \"The Natural\" after he hit .360 with a 1.067 OPS in his first 37 games. Francoeur finished the season batting .300/.336/.549 in 67 games, with 14 home runs, and 44 RBIs. During his rookie season he garnered a reputation as a free swinging fastball hitter, with his first walk not coming until his 128th plate appearance. On defense, Francoeur became known for having a strong and accurate arm, finishing the season with 13 outfield assists (third overall in MLB) despite playing less than half the season. He finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting while garnering the most second place votes.\n\nFrancoeur hit .260 with 29 homers and 103 RBIs in his first full season in the majors. He also became just the fourth Brave to play in all 162 games of a season, joining Félix Millán, Dale Murphy, and Andruw Jones. Francoeur was ejected for the first time in his career on July 16, 2006. On May 13, 2006, Francoeur hit a walk-off grand slam against the Washington Nationals, the first walk-off home run and grand slam of his career.\n\nIn his second full season in 2007, Francoeur batted .293, with 19 homers, and 105 RBIs. Francoeur also displayed talent on the defensive side of the field, leading the league in outfield assists with 19 while earning his first career Gold Glove. Francoeur played in all 162 games for the second consecutive season. He was ejected for the second time in his career on July 16, 2007, exactly one year to the day of his first ejection.\n\nOn April 12, 2008, Francoeur went 3 for 5 against the Washington Nationals including two home runs and a career high seven RBIs. He compiled a streak of 370 consecutive games played before sitting out the second game of a doubleheader, on May 20, 2008. On May 22, 2008, Francoeur went 3 for 4 against the New York Mets with an RBI triple, an RBI single, and a two-run home run, finishing a double short of a cycle.\n\nAfter weeks of being mired in the worst slump of his career, Braves management optioned Francoeur to Double-A Mississippi on July 4, 2008, to work with his old hitting coach Phillip Wellman and refine his swing away from the pressurized major league setting. Francoeur had posted a line of .234/.287/.374 to that point of the season. Francoeur was recalled on July 7, 2008, after only three days in the minors because of the rash of injuries suffered by the Braves, over the holiday weekend. His slump continued after his return to the majors; Francoeur posted a .234/.300/.324 line through September 10.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, Francoeur was traded to the New York Mets for outfielder Ryan Church.\n\nFrancoeur made his Mets debut on July 11, 2009, and notched two RBIs in his first at bat. He finished the day going 2–4 with two RBIs, a strikeout, and was caught stealing once. On July 20, Francoeur hit his first home run as a Met off Washington Nationals pitcher Logan Kensing, during the ninth inning of that game.\n\nOn August 23, 2009, Francoeur became the second player in major league history (after Homer Summa in 1927) to hit into a game-ending unassisted triple play. He hit a line drive directly to Eric Bruntlett, second baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies. Francoeur re-signed with the Mets for 2010.\n\nAfter being the Mets' starting right fielder for the first half of the 2010 season, Francoeur was replaced by Ángel Pagán to make room for the return of Carlos Beltrán in the second half.\n\nOn August 31, 2010, Francoeur was traded by the Mets to the Texas Rangers for infielder Joaquín Árias. Francoeur was utilized primarily for defensive purposes on the 2010 AL Champions.\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Francoeur signed a one-year deal with the Kansas City Royals worth $2.5 million which included a mutual option for the 2012 season.\n\nOn August 18, 2011, Francoeur agreed to a two-year extension with the Royals worth $13.5 million. He was designated for assignment on June 30, 2013 after hitting .208/.249/.322 in 59 games with the Royals.\n\nFrancoeur was signed to a minor league contract by the Giants, on July 9, 2013. On July 13, his contract was purchased from the Fresno Grizzlies. Francoeur was designated for assignment on August 20, and released on August 22. In 22 games for the Giants, he recorded 12 hits, 4 RBIs, batting only .194.\n\nFrancoeur signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians on January 6, 2014. The organization released Francoeur on March 22, 2014.\n\nFrancoeur signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres, on March 26, 2014. He was assigned to the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas and hit the first home run in team history on April 3, 2014. They considered converting him into a pitcher, and he spent part of his time in the minors pitching. However, they decided to keep him as an outfielder in the end. He was called up and was in the starting lineup on July 23. On August 11, Francoeur was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and was outrighted back to the Chihuahuas. Francoeur elected free agency in October 2014.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, Francoeur signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.\nOn June 16, 2015, Francoeur was used as a relief pitcher in a 19–3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, throwing the only scoreless inning of the game. However, he surrendered two runs in the next inning. In July, he began to have success both off the bench and in the starting lineup, including a stretch during which he hit three home runs in eight games. Although he expressed a desire to remain with the Phillies through the 2015 season and perhaps even beyond, his play indicated he might be moved near the trading deadline to bolster a contending team's outfield. However, he was not moved at the trade deadline. Ultimately, he finished the season with a .258 batting average, 13 home runs, and 45 RBIs.\n\nOn February 22, 2016, Francoeur agreed to a minor-league deal with the Braves, with an invitation to spring training. On March 29, the Braves purchased Francoeur's contract.\n\nFrancoeur was traded to the Miami Marlins on August 24, 2016, in a three-team deal that included the Texas Rangers. The Braves got minor league utility player Dylan Moore from the Rangers and minor league catcher Matt Foley from the Marlins.\n\nOn May 12, 2017, it was announced that Francoeur would become a color analyst for select Atlanta Braves baseball games broadcast on Fox Sports South and Fox Sports Southeast. On November 29, 2018, the Braves announced that Jeff Francoeur would replace Joe Simpson as their lead television analyst. In September 2019, it was announced that he had been hired by TBS to work as an analyst for the network's NL Wild Card Game, NLDS (Washington vs. Los Angeles alongside Ernie Johnson Jr.) and National League Championship Series (NLCS) alongside Brian Anderson and Ron Darling.\n\nAlong with former Braves teammate Chipper Jones, Francoeur played on the USA team in the first ever World Baseball Classic, in March 2006. In six at bats, he hit a double, and scored one run.\n\nFrancoeur comes from a family of teachers. His parents, David and Karen, are both retired teachers. Francoeur's father, who is of French-Canadian heritage, is from Springfield, Massachusetts; his mother is from Green Bay, Wisconsin. His sister Heather (Francoeur) Karvis used to teach English and co-coached the girls' basketball team at St. Pius X Catholic High School in Atlanta with Josh Geffner. She now teaches and coaches the varsity girls basketball team at The Westminster Schools in Atlanta. His brother David Francoeur, Jr. teaches special education at Parkview High School in Lilburn, Georgia. In 2007, on SportSouth the \"Big Braves Summer\" promos, Francoeur revealed that his profession of choice (were he not a baseball player) would be coaching high school football.\n\nHe graduated from Parkview High School in Lilburn, Georgia in 2002. He lettered in both baseball and football. He led Parkview to the Georgia AAAAA high school football championships in 2000 and 2001 as a wide receiver and defensive back. Francoeur was offered a scholarship to play wide receiver at Clemson University, before turning that down and getting drafted in the first round. He also led Parkview to two state titles in baseball, in 2001 and 2002. While in third grade, he met his future wife, Catie McCoy Francoeur. They started dating as seniors in high school, and married on November 3, 2007.

{"id": "2187986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187986", "title": "Metarealism", "text": "Metarealism\n\nMetarealism is a direction in Russian poetry and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by Mikhail Epshtein, who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine \"Voprosy Literatury\" in 1983\n\nM. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is \"metaphysical realism,\" while \"stylistically\" metarealism is \"metaphorical\" realism. Thus, \"meta\" means both \"through\" and \"beyond\" the reality that we all can see; hence, \"metarealism\" is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual metaphor or, according to another Epshtein's term, a \"metabola\" (rather than hyperbole), that means \"transfer\" or \"transition,\" opening many dimensions. \"Metabola\" is different from the symbol or a \"visual\" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. Metarealism has little to do with surrealism, since it appeals to the superconscious and not to the subconscious, thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.\n\nMetarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the Hyperrealists, where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism.\n\nMetarealism is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts. For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities. For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its figurative and transcendent meanings.\n\nMetarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a holistic view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is \"the geometrical space constituted by points of view.\n\nAccording to Bernard De Montréal, most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the euphoric, sub mental symbolism of the art form an avocation of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self.\n\nConscious or mental art \"metarealism\" when created by a metaconscious artist is inspired by the higher self and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artifact of relative value.\n\nThe mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative \"expiration\" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.\n\n"}

Services are currently concentrated on Heathrow Airport, with one other from Luton Airport. RailAir services are operated as public transport services by or on behalf of train operators, where the whole journey is paid for as a through ticket which combines the railway and bus journey, although journeys can be made using the bus only. As such, many are operated where the train and bus operator are owned by the same company.\n\nRailair services originated as a partnership between the nationalised bus operator, the National Bus Company, and the nationalised rail operator, British Rail, under the Railair Link brand name.\n\nIn Luton National Bus Company subsidiary Luton & District, operated a Railair Link branded shuttle bus between Luton railway station and Luton Airport, as the Luton Flyer. Luton Airport Parkway railway station has since been built closer to the airport.\n\nFrom 1967, Thames Valley Traction, (later Alder Valley), operated a Railair Link coach between Heathrow and Reading station in a yellow striped livery as route X25, and later in National Bus Company coach livery. A Railair Link service was also operated by coach operator Rickards from Heathrow to Woking.\n\nAfter bus deregulation, the existing Reading and Woking to Heathrow Railair services passed to private companies.\nPrivatised Alder Valley, as the Bee Line bus company, owned by Q-Drive, operated the Heathrow to Reading Railair service in bottle green liveried coaches as the Rail Air service with marketing for the onward rail links to South Wales and the West of England. When Beeline passed to FirstGroup, the Railair service was operated ultimately by First Berkshire, which in 2003 relaunched the service with Irizar Century bodied Scania K114IB coaches. The serviced operates as the FirstGroup branded service Rail Air.com.\n\nThe Woking to Heathrow service was operated by Speedlink Airport Services in a blue livery. Speedlink was later sold to National Express, which operated it in a light blue version of their 2003 livery, in conjunction with Stagecoach's South West Trains subsidiary, also with branding promoting rail connections to the South West.\n\nIn 2006 Virgin Trains West Coast, which is 49% owned by Stagecoach, introduced Virgin Trains liveried coaches for Railair links to Virgin trains services from Luton and Heathrow airports, as the Virgin Trains ExpressCoach services, operated by Stagecoach East. From 1 June 2008, the Virgin service to Heathrow was withdrawn, with passengers directed to Green Line route 724 as a replacement.\n\nRailAir is used as a generic term for these services by the public and airline operators, such as British Airways at Heathrow, and as a specific brand name of some of the services. The Reading to Heathrow RailAir bus allows connection from cities such as Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth and South Wales to Heathrow Airport without having to change at London Paddington. However, it is possible to change trains at Hayes & Harlington and go by train instead, a change at Reading being also required for this service.\n\nWith the exception of London Buses route 285, Railair services are direct express coach services, longer and in contrast to local airport buses from nearby stations and offer through ticketing, as opposed to bus-only ticketed airport hub connected coach networks, such as National Express Airport branded services.\n\nIn 2008 National Express dropped the smile livery for a group wide re-branding, thus more normally National Express are running the route. In July 2019 First Berkshire & The Thames Valley will commence operating route RA2 from Heathrow Airport to Guildford station.\n\n"}

While a student at the Université du Québec à Montréal he became active in left wing politics with the \"Groupe Marxiste Revolutionnaire\", a Quebec-based part of The Waffle, a radical wing of Canada's New Democratic Party.\n\nIn May 1968, he was deeply involved in Montreal in the organization of the student movement for the democratization of the education system. Soon after, Cossette-Trudel's views became more extreme and he joined the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) whose members were responsible for a decade of radical manifestos, bombings and armed robberies in the Province of Quebec.\n\nWhile still a student, he met and married another radical leftist, Louise Lanctôt. During what became known as the October Crisis, as the leader of the FLQ's Liberation Cell, on October 5, 1970, Jacques Cossette-Trudel along with his wife Louise, her brother Jacques Lanctôt, Yves Langlois, Nigel Hamer, and Marc Carbonneau abducted James Cross, the British Trade Commissioner, from his Montreal home, demanding the release of 27 convicted FLQ militants and the publication of the group's political manifesto. The federal government, at the invitation of the Quebec provincial government, responded with the adoption of the War Measures Act. Under this law, 500 citizens were jailed and 10,000 Canadian soldiers were deployed on the streets of Montreal. Believing many of their fellow citizens would join an uprising, the goal of the FLQ was to create an independent socialist state based on the ideals of Fidel Castro's Cuba and the Algerian revolution.\n\nEarly in December 1970, police discovered the location of Cossette-Trudel's Liberation Cell hideout. The safe release of their hostage, Cross, was negotiated and on December 3, 1970, after Cossette-Trudel, his wife, and the other known members of his cell were granted safe passage to Cuba, with approval from Fidel Castro, Cross was released.\n\nJacques Cossette-Trudel and his wife remained in Cuba for four years. They worked as volunteers for the Cuban press agency Prensa Latina. Their son, Alexis Cossette-Trudel was born in 1972. In 1974, they moved to France as political asylum seekers. Though asylum was refused, they were permitted to remain in France. Their second child, Marie-Ange Cossette-Trudel, was born in France in 1974.\n\nOn October 13, 1977, Quebec Premier René Lévesque announced he was seeking a pardon for Jacques Cossette-Trudel and his wife. The federal government consented to their return. On December 13, 1978, they pleaded guilty at trial in Montreal and were sentenced to five years' probation and two years in a provincial jail for their part in the kidnapping and attempted extortion. They were freed on parole after serving eight months.\n\nSince divorced from his wife, Jacques Cossette-Trudel has made a living as a communication counsellor in provincial health and social institutions. Since 2000, he has been a successful screenwriter and filmmaker and has received financial assistance from Téléfilm Canada and the Sodec for his work.\n\nAccording to a 2000 interview he gave to Radio-Canada television, Jacques Cossette-Trudel has always stayed very connected politically and still believes in an independent, multicultural and socialist state of Quebec.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188010", "title": "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen", "text": "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\n\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" is a television film that served as the 256th and final episode of the American television series \"M*A*S*H\". Closing out the series' 11th season, the two-hour episode first aired on CBS on February 28, 1983, ending the series' original run. The episode was written by eight collaborators, including series star Alan Alda, who also directed.\n\nThe episode's plot chronicles the final days of the Korean War at the 4077th MASH; it features several storylines intended to show the war's effects on the individual personnel of the unit and to bring closure to the series. After the ceasefire goes into effect, the members of the 4077th throw a party before taking down the camp for the last time. After tear-filled goodbyes, the main characters go their separate ways, leading to the final scene of the series.\n\nAs peace negotiations continue during the Korean War, Hawkeye Pierce undergoes treatment at a psychiatric hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown in the OR. Prompted by Sidney Freedman, he gradually recalls an incident that occurred while the personnel of the 4077th were returning to camp from an outing. Their bus had stopped to pick up some refugees and wounded soldiers, but was forced to pull off the road in order to avoid being spotted by an enemy patrol. Hawkeye recounts that he had told a woman to keep her \"chicken\" quiet, which she did by smothering it to death. Under further questioning he eventually reveals that this was his own mental substitution of the event in order to cope with it, and the woman had actually smothered her baby (the “baby” played by actor Thuy Tong). He resents Sidney for making him remember the baby's death, but Sidney explains it as a necessary part of the recovery process. He sends Hawkeye back to the 4077th and promises to check in on him.\n\nMeanwhile, a runaway tank destroys the camp latrine and crashes nearby. Leaving the camp, to relieve himself in a creek, Charles Winchester is surprised to find five Chinese soldiers ready to surrender to him. He brings them back to camp and, after discovering that they are musicians, calls for Mozart, and one of them spontaneously plays a theme from Mozart's Clarinet Quintet. Winchester begins to teach them the entire piece. When he is turned down for a staff position at a prestigious Boston hospital, Margaret Houlihan secretly uses her father's connections to get it for him. Charles becomes angry with Margaret after learning from Klinger that he only won the position through her intervention.\n\nKlinger has fallen in love with Soon-Lee Han, a local Korean refugee, and he persuades her not to look for her missing parents in an area of heavy fighting. B.J. Hunnicutt receives his discharge orders and promises Colonel Potter that he can arrange for a surgeon to take his place. During a sudden mortar attack prompted by the presence of the crashed tank, Father Mulcahy rushes to free several POWs from a makeshift holding pen and is knocked to the ground by a shell explosion that causes him to lose most of his hearing. He demands that B.J. – the only one who knows about Mulcahy's growing deafness – keep it a secret so that he will not be discharged and lose his opportunity to care for the local orphans.\n\nShortly after B.J. leaves to begin his journey home, Potter receives a notice rescinding his discharge but decides not to act on it. Hawkeye returns to camp and learns to his dismay that B.J. did not leave him a goodbye note. As the shelling continues, he impulsively jumps into the tank and drives it into the camp garbage dump, diverting the enemy fire away from the OR. Potter becomes concerned and calls Sidney for a follow-up visit with Hawkeye.\n\nThe camp is forced to relocate due to an incendiary bomb attack and resulting forest fire. Once the unit has set up a new site, the replacement surgeon arrives – B.J. himself, who had made it as far as Guam before word of the rescinded discharge reached him. During a party to celebrate the second birthday of B.J.'s daughter, Hawkeye at first believes Sidney is there to confront him about the tank incident, but Sidney reassures him that his actions were sensible in caring for his fellow soldiers. \nHawkeye then confides to Sidney his fear that the incident on the bus may have made him scared to be near children or do his job. Sidney brushes off these fears, telling Hawkeye that his failures may make him a better doctor. Hawkeye later hesitates briefly before operating on a young girl, but is able to go ahead with the procedure; Sidney leaves the 4077th with his thanks.\n\nCharles reluctantly says goodbye to the Chinese musicians during a prisoner exchange, and they play the Mozart Clarinet Quintet for him while being driven away in a truck. A final ceasefire is announced, to take effect at 10:00 that night and mark the end of hostilities in the war. Wounded soldiers continue to arrive as the surgeons operate and the camp moves back to its original site on orders from headquarters. While performing triage, Charles is horrified to discover that one of the musicians has been brought in dead and that the others were killed when their truck was attacked. Dazed, he returns to the Swamp and tries to listen to the record with Clarinet Quintet he taught them, but pulls it off the turntable and smashes it in sudden anger.\n\nOnce the surgical shift is finished, the camp personnel throw a final party in the mess tent and talk about their plans for after the war. Klinger surprises everyone by announcing that he wants to marry Soon-Lee and stay in Korea to help her find her parents. The next morning, Mulcahy officiates at their wedding before the camp is dismantled and everyone says their goodbyes, leaving via assorted modes of transportation. Charles apologizes to Margaret for his earlier poor treatment of her and gives her a book of poetry as a going-away present.\n\nJust before Hawkeye leaves in a chopper, B.J. shouts that he left a note this time. As he lifts off, Hawkeye looks down and sees it: the word GOODBYE spelled out with rocks across the landing pad. He smiles to himself as the chopper carries him away from the 4077th.\n\nThe anticipation before the airing of \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was unprecedented, especially for a regular television series (in contrast to awards shows, sporting events, or special events). Interest from advertisers prompted CBS, the network broadcasting \"M*A*S*H\", to sell 30-second commercial blocks for $450,000 (equal to $ today) each—costlier than even for NBC's airing of the Super Bowl of that year.\n\nOn the night the episode aired, large areas of California (particularly the San Francisco Bay Area) suffered power outages due to unusually stormy winter weather, which prevented many viewers from watching the series finale. Three weeks later, on March 21, KPIX, the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, re-aired the episode.\n\nIn the United States, the episode drew 105.97 million total viewers and a total audience of 121.6 million, more than both Super Bowl XVII and the \"Roots\" miniseries. The episode surpassed the single-episode ratings record that had been set by the \"Dallas\" episode that resolved the \"Who Shot J.R.?\" cliffhanger. From 1983 until 2010, \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" remained the most watched television broadcast in American history, passed only in total viewership (but not in ratings or share) in February 2010 by Super Bowl XLIV. It still stands as the most-watched finale of any television series, as well as the most-watched episode.\n\nAs \"M*A*S*H\" was one of the most successful shows in TV history, in order not to lose the franchise completely, CBS quickly created a new series, \"AfterMASH\", that followed the postwar adventures of Colonel Potter, Max Klinger, and Father Mulcahy in a stateside hospital. Despite wide popularity in its premiere episodes, script problems and constant character changes led to a sharp decline in viewers, and the show was canceled by CBS after only two seasons. Another would-be spin-off, \"W*A*L*T*E*R\", was a pilot made in 1984 that was never picked up. It starred Gary Burghoff, who reprised his \"M*A*S*H\" character.\n\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was not initially included in the syndication package for \"M*A*S*H\"s final season; however, in 1992, the episode made its syndication premiere in time for its 10th anniversary. Local stations aired it as a part of a \"Movie of the Week\".\n\n\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" was not the final show filmed, as the final season was filmed out of order. The final scene filmed for the series was the time capsule burial scene from \"As Time Goes By\".\n\nThe wildfire story line was written into the show after a real wildfire destroyed most of the outdoor set, in October 1982. The scene was filmed less than 12 hours after the fire had ravaged the set.\n\nWhen \"M*A*S*H\" was shown on FX and Hallmark Channel, they aired \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\" occasionally. Hallmark Channel showed it twice a year, February and August, before dropping \"M*A*S*H\" from its schedule. TV Land and MeTV have also shown the episode sporadically, including Veterans Day broadcasts on November 11, 2015 and November 11, 2019. In Canada, the cable channel History Television shows the episode in its entirety annually on the Labor Day holiday.\n\nIn 2011, the TV Guide Network special \"TV's Most Unforgettable Finales\" ranked this finale as the best.\n\n"}

Although derived from the successful P-38 Lightning, the XP-58 was plagued by technical problems with its engines that eventually led to the project's cancellation.\n\nThe XP-58 was a Lockheed Aircraft Company funded initiative to develop an improved Lightning as a long-range fighter following the release by the U.S. Army Air Corps of the Lightning for sale to Britain on 20 April 1940. Initially, two designs were formulated, both using the Continental IV-1430 engines. One would be a single-seat aircraft with one 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and four .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. The second would be a two-seat aircraft with the addition of a flexible .50 in (12.7 mm) gun at the end of each tail boom.\n\nIn July 1940, Lockheed decided to switch to Pratt & Whitney XH-2600 engines as the aircraft would be underpowered with the Continental engines, with the aircraft having two seats and designated \"XP-58\". However, soon Lockheed was advised the development of the XH-2600 engine was terminated. After consideration of the engine alternatives, the design was changed to use two Wright R-2160 Tornado engines, as well as a change of the rear-facing armament to two turrets, one upper and the other lower on the fuselage, each turret containing two .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. As support equipment for the two crewmen was added, the estimated weight of the XP-58 grew to by August 1941.\n\nIn March 1942, the USAAF placed an order for a second XP-58 that would incorporate increased fuel tanks to obtain a range of 3,000 mi (4,800 km). The Air Force were uncertain about the role and armament of the aircraft, and in September 1942, a decision was made to convert the aircraft for a role as a low-altitude attack aircraft, armed with a 75 mm (2.95 in) M5 autocannon. Adequate aircraft were already available for this mission, with the Douglas A-26 Invader and Beechcraft XA-38 Grizzly under development. As a result, the second XP-58 was canceled and the role of the design reverted to that of a high-altitude fighter, using large-bore cannon firing high-explosive shells to break up bomber formations.\n\nThe 37 mm (1.46 in) M4 autocannon was originally selected for a quadruple mount in the nose, but the trajectory of the 37mm shells dropped lower than other weaponry, limiting its effective range. A hydraulically articulated nose that could be bent up to correct this problem was tried, but was dismissed as too complex. Then, a 75 mm (2.95 in) M5 autocannon paired with twin .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns was tried and proved much more successful.\n\nIn February 1943, use of another engine, the Allison V-3420, was necessary due to poor progress with the Tornado engine development. With this change, the second XP-58 was resurrected. The XP-58 had its first flight on 6 June 1944, but flight test work on the XP-58 took second place to other higher priority developments. Eventually, 25 test flights were completed. The XP-58 was then flown to Wright Field for USAAF acceptance tests, even though the turbo-superchargers were experiencing torching and a number of systems were not installed including provision for cockpit pressurization and armament with its fire-control equipment. Although the prototype arrived at Wright Field on 22 October 1944, the aircraft was a maintenance headache and no further trials were conducted. The construction of the second prototype was abandoned.\n\n"}

The term \"Superman Family\" is often used to refer to the extended cast of characters of comics books associated with Superman. A similarly titled series, Superman Family Adventures, was published in 2012–2013.\n\n\"The Superman Family\" was an amalgamation of the titles \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\", \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\", and \"Supergirl\". The first issue, #164, took its numbering from \"Jimmy Olsen\", which had reached issue #163 and thus had the most issues published. \"Lois Lane\" ended at #137, while the newly launched \"Supergirl\" book had only made it to #9 at the time. A 10th and final issue of \"Supergirl\" was published five months after \"Superman Family's\" launch.\n\n\"The Superman Family\" went through two distinct phases. In its inception the three leads Jimmy Olsen, Lois Lane, and Supergirl rotated new stories each issue with reprints for the other characters. The first six issues (#164–169) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format and Nick Cardy was the cover artist. Changes were made in the setting of Supergirl's adventures during the character's run in the title. She moves to Florida to join the faculty at the New Athens Experimental School in issue #165. In an \"imaginary tale\" set in a possible future in issue #200, Supergirl, now known as Super\"woman\", is depicted as being the Governor of Florida in her secret identity of Linda Danvers. She leaves Florida and relocates to New York City to become a soap opera actress in issue #208.\n\nAfter the cancellation of \"Super-Team Family\", a Supergirl/Doom Patrol team-up originally scheduled to appear in that title was published in \"The Superman Family\" #191–193. Supergirl battled the Enchantress in issues #204–205 and teamed with the Legion of Super-Heroes in issue #207.\n\n\"The Superman Family\" became the first DC Comics series in the 80-page Dollar Comic format, consisting of 64 pages of new stories, beginning with issue #182 (March–April 1977). With that issue, the \"framing element\" was removed from the covers, and the book switched to printing all-new material. It became a monthly series in 1981, starting with issue #207.\n\n\nDC published several other \"... Family\" titles concurrently with \"The Superman Family\". These included \"Batman Family\" (1975–78), \"Super-Team Family\" (1975–78) and \"Tarzan Family\" (1975–76). As a rule, DC's other \"... Family\" titles contained mostly reprints and featured a higher page count and higher price than DC's other titles.\n\nWith issue #222 (September 1982), \"The Superman Family\" was canceled and replaced with \"The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl\", which briefly featured a \"Lois Lane\" backup series.\n\nIn 2012, DC launched a new series titled \"Superman Family Adventures\" written by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani and drawn by Baltazar. Baltazar and Aureliani are the winners of the 2011 Eisner Award in the category \"Best Publication for Kids\" for their work on the \"Tiny Titans\" title for DC. Fuzzy the Krypto Mouse, a character who appeared in a single story in \"Superboy\" #65 (June 1958), inspired a similar character created by Baltazar for \"Superman Family Adventures\". \"Superman Family Adventures\" ended with issue #12.\n\n\n"}

Desperately short of raw materials, the Germans sought to produce a radically cheaper alternative to their standard submachine gun, the MP 40.\n\nThe MP 3008 was a simple blowback design operating from an open bolt. It was crudely manufactured in small machine shops and variations were common. Typically, the magazine was bottom-mounted unlike the side-mounted Sten. Initially all steel without handgrips, the wire buttstock was welded to the frame and was typically triangular, however the design changed as conditions inside Germany worsened and on final guns wooden stocks and other variations are found.\n\nThe Gerät Potsdam, another version of the Sten Mk II produced by Mauser in 1944, was an exact copy of the original Sten, right down to its manufacturing stamps in an effort to conceal its origin for clandestine operations. About 28,000 were claimed to have been produced, but postwar interrogations of highly ranked Mauser personnel failed to provide proof that any more than 10,000 units had been made.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188048", "title": "List of digital television deployments by country", "text": "List of digital television deployments by country\n\nThis is a list of digital television deployments by country, which summarises the process and progress of transition from analogue to digital broadcasting.\n\nThe transition to digital television is a process that is happening at different paces around the world. Although digital satellite television is now commonplace, the switch to digital cable and terrestrial television has taken longer. See also Digital terrestrial television.\n\nNot all countries are compatible within each standard DVB-T, ATSC (North America), DTMB (China), ISDB (of which there are two incompatible variations used in Japan and South America respectively). Countries that have adopted digital terrestrial recently may have a single MPEG4 based system for SD and HD, while countries with more established system may use MPEG2 for SD and MPEG4 for HD. There are also variations in middleware used. For example, Italy, Ireland and the UK are all DVB-T regions, but Ireland uses \"MPEG4 + MHEG5 + DVB-T\" for both SD and HD transmissions, while the UK uses \"MPEG2 + MHEG5 + DVB-T\" for SD and \"MPEG4 + MHEG5 + DVB-T2\" for HDTV, and Italy uses MHP rather than MHEG5 middleware. Since all MPEG4-capable receivers can decode the MPEG2 codec and all DVB-T2 tuners are capable of tuning DVB-T signals, UK HD set-top boxes are compatible with both the UK SD system and Irish SD/HD system, but Irish SD/HD tuners will only work with the SD system used in the UK. Digital cable broadcast tends to be DVB-C or very similar QAM in almost all countries. Broadband on cable is mostly DOCSIS which is DVB-C on the download path. This is important when buying a TV or set-box online rather than from a local retailer who would normally only stock the compatible system. Incompatible retail products are a severe problem in emerging retail digital markets where a neighbouring country has an older standard and dominates the retail trade, such as UK Freeview (rather than compatible \"Freeview HD\") products in Ireland.\n\nImportant DVB-T standards are UK D-book for UK Freeview and Nordig 2.2 for Scandinavia and Ireland. Ireland deviates from Nordig by using UK profile MHEG5 middleware rather than MHP.\n\nISDB-T International is adopted as the first country in Africa on February 26, 2013, evaluated the hierarchical mode of operation, which allows for the simultaneous transmission to fixed, mobile and portable receivers from a single transmitter, advantageous over DVB-T2. Broadcasting in digital drives to transform Botswana into an E-Society.\n\nThe earliest form of digital television in Mozambique began in 1996 with Southern African pay-TV operator DStv. Channels were transmitted and received via satellites and digital decoders. Some years later, TVCabo, began transmitting at first through analog and later digital means using decoders and an extensive fiber optic network. On January 18, Mozambique's Ministry of Transport and Communications announced that the country would be adopting the DVB-T2 system for transmission of terrestrial television channels. The implementation is expected to be completed by 2015.\n\nNational Television Company in Morocco started DVB-T based digital TV deployment in February 2007.\n\nDigital TV is now available in the following cities and their regions: Casablanca, Benslimane, Settat, Nouaceur, Mediouna, Mohammedia, Rabat, Salé, Skhirat-Temara, Kenitra, Sidi Kacem, Khemisset, Meknes, Fes, Oujda, Tanger and Marrakech.\n\nWhile Namibia's public broadcasters still rely on analogue transmission and have not announced a transition date to digital television, the pay-TV operator MultiChoice already operates a digital television service using the DVB-T standard.\n\nThe first digital television implementation in South Africa was a satellite-based system launched by pay-TV operator MultiChoice in 1995. On 22 February 2007 the South African government announced that the country's public TV operators would be broadcasting in digital by 1 November 2008, followed by a three-year dual-illumination period which would end on 1 November 2011. The government in January 2011 announced a change in its choice of technology from DVB-T to DVB-T2 with the analog switch off date postponed to December 2013. The rollout of digital television has been further delayed until 2017.\n\nThe Oqaab service using DVB-T2 was launched in 2015.\n\nA digital television trial was completed on November 9, 2000 – May 31, 2001 and was officially launched on November 9, 2010 by TV5. Analog switch-off will be 2015-2020.\n\nAs at 2017, Phnom Penh Cable Television and One TV offer encrypted DVB-T2 pay TV services, viewable only with a subscription and set top box with card.\n\nIn Phnom Penh, the following channels are available free to air:\n\nS Movie, SREPLAY (ETV), S Cinema, Nice TV, Fox Sports, Fox Action Movies, ARY Musik, CGTN Documentary, YTN World, SanSha TV, OneTV Sabay 1\n\nIn June and September 2003, the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) selected 41 experimental spots for digital television trials and launched the trials later before year end 2003. Later, according to the Tenth Five Year Plan and 2010 long-range plan for radio, film and television, SARFT drafted a switch-off timetable for different levels of Chinese cities, towns and counties, in which it was commanded that by 2010 digital broadcasting be implemented overall and by 2015 analog televisions be phased out completely. It was estimated that by year end 2007, China would have over 27 million digital TV users.\n\nIn 2004, debates arose about whether the digital television technology by Tsinghua University or Shanghai Jiao Tong University should be adopted as the national standards. Finally, in late July 2007, China announced the final version of standards as a combined one and Tsinghua succeeded in this battle as 95% of its technology has been adopted.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, the first HDTV channel in China, which would be broadcast nationwide later, began to air in Hangzhou.\n\nOn December 31, 2007, local broadcasters started to air HDTV (1920X1080i) using Chinese DTMB standard. Currently, there are 12 HD channels airing 24 hours daily. Hong Kong broadcasters are keen to use whichever standard China adopts, since doing so would allow them to transmit into the lucrative market in Southern China, and would lessen the need for costly format conversion.\n\nIn India there are over 600 Satellite television channels that are being broadcast as of 2012. India has adopted DVB-T system for digital television in July 1999. The first DVB-T transmission was started on 26 January 2003 in the four major metropolitan cities by Doordarshan. Currently the terrestrial transmission is available in both digital and analog formats. The Cable Digitalisation act mandates all cable television networks to turnoff analogue transmission and switch to digital transmission by 31 March 2015. The digital transition is planned over four phases in the country. The first analogue transmission cutoff date is set to 1 November 2012, for the four major metropolitan cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai). The Second analogue transmission cutoff date is 31 March 2013 for Patna, Chandigarh, Pune and Bengaluru. The third analogue transmission cutoff date is 30 November 2014 for all urban areas including state capitals. The analogue transmission cut off date for all other cities in the country is set for 31 March 2015.The switchover is tollaly completed in December 2016\n\nDigital television is also available through Direct To Home service. These services are provided using locally built satellites from ISRO such as INSAT 4CR, INSAT 4A, INSAT-2E, INSAT-3C and INSAT-3E as well as private satellites such as the Dutch-based SES, Global-owned NSS 6, Thaicom-2 and Telstar 10. India currently has seven major DTH service providers and a total of over 23 million subscriber households in 2010. These are Dish TV(a ZEE TV subsidiary), Tata Sky, Sun Network owned 'Sundirect DTH', Reliance owned BIG TV, Bharti Airtel's DTH Service 'Airtel Digital TV' and the public sector DD Direct Plus. As of 2010, India has the most competitive Direct-broadcast satellite market with seven operators vying for more than 110 million TV homes. India overtook USA as the world's largest Direct-broadcast satellite market in 2012.\n\nIndonesia began experimenting with digital TV broadcasting in 2008. In January 2014, the Supreme Court annulled the decisions of the Communication and Information Technology Regulation, removing requirements for an analog shut-off and allowing local analogue broadcasters to rent back channels allocated to digital broadcasting. From August 2014, UHF DVB-T2 equipment has been available for public purchase.\n\nIran started the transition to digital TV broadcasting in 2009 using DVB-T MPEG-4 standard. Iran plans to completely switch over to digital TV by 2015. As of summer of 2011, Iranian digital TV broadcast covered 40% of Iran's population.\n\nThe Knesset approved the law regarding DTT in late 2007. The Second Authority for Television and Radio is responsible for the deployment of the system - the project name is \"Idan+\". The package consists of 6 channels: IBA1, IBA33, Channel 2, Channel 10, Channel 23 (Israeli Educational Television) and The Knesset Channel. DVB-T broadcasts using the MPEG-4 Part 10, H.264 (AVC) video and HE AAC+ V2 audio codecs were launched in mid-2009. There were proceedings in the Knesset to add local music channel 24 to the system as well. Full technical details along with a map of the country showing transmitter locations can be found here and here .\n\nAdditional channels will be added using the DVB-T2 standard already testing since 2014 in central Israel, showing mainly IBA-TV1 HD channel and various tests in Dolby Digital .\n\nJapan pioneered HDTV with an analog implementation. The old system is not compatible with the new digital standards. Japanese terrestrial broadcasting of HD via ISDB-T started on December 1, 2003 in the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya metropolitan areas of Japan, and expanded to the outer areas before September 30, 2007. It has been reported that 31 million HD receivers have been sold in Japan as of January 2008.\n\nThe Japanese government is studying the implementation of some improvements on the standard as suggested by Brazilian researchers (SBTVD). These new features are unlikely to be adopted in Japan due to incompatibility problems, but are being considered for use in future implementations in other countries, including Brazil itself.\n\nThe move to DTV by consumers is relatively slow, partly because high-definition televisions are very expensive. Additionally, there have been issues with the B-CAS system and Digital Rights Management in respect to the home recording of broadcasts.\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the Japanese electronics industry association set the rule (of copy control) for DTT broadcasting that allows consumers up 10 times more dubbing of entire TV program with video and audio into DVD recorder, etc. by way of a new program called . Dubbing 10 was planned to start on June 2, 2008, but it was postponed A settlement with the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers was reached on June 15, and it was later confirmed on June 24 that the Dubbing 10 program will start on July 4, 2008. The manufacturers for the DVD and associated DTT recorders will make the units conform to the \"Dubbing 10\" rule and some manufacturers might release the downloading subprograms to update the recorder's internal software for existing users.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, DPA (The Association for Promotion of Digital Broadcasting-Japan) announced that there has been a total 32.71 million of DTT (ISDB-T) receiving television sets (except 1seg receivers) installed in Japan as of end of March 2008. DPA also announced the guideline documentation to manufacturers who make the DTT receiver, recorder and replay units to operate with the personal computer on April 8, 2008. This add-on unit operates on USB or PCI BUS, and went on sale in May 2008.\n\nFrom January 22 to January 24, 2010, analog television broadcasting was suspended for 48 hours as part of a rehearsal to approximately 7,000 homes in Suzu and parts of Noto.\n\nOn September 24, 2010 at noon, analog TV transmissions officially ended in Suzu and parts of Noto (approximately 8,800 homes) as part of the rehearsal plan that took place one year ahead of the nationwide shutdown, which was scheduled to start on July 24, 2011. Though this analog broadcasting shutdown was isolated to a small, rural area, it was the first complete analog shutdown in Asia outside of Israel.\n\nOn April 20, 2011, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications confirmed that the analog terrestrial TV service will shut down on July 24 in 44 of the 47 prefectures. The three prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima were heavily damaged by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and its related nuclear accidents, and as a result, television stations in those three prefectures shut down their analog signals nine months later on March 31, 2012.\n\nAfter a long controversy between the government and broadcasters in South Korea, ATSC was chosen over DVB-T. Since 2005, digital services have been available across the entire country. South Korea also developed its own mobile TV standard called DMB, Digital Multimedia Broadcasting, based on the European technology af Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB). It has a satellite, subscription-based, version (S-DMB), and a free, terrestrial version (T-DMB). T-DMB encountered a wide success, both in South Korea and abroad. For more details see Digital Multimedia Broadcasting.\n\nMalaysia started DVB-T tests in 2006, and the first DTTB services were rolled out in a few areas of the country in January 2014. On 6 June 2017, digital television officially launched in the country with the launch of MYTV Broadcasting. Nine channels are being broadcast on the service, including: TV1, TV2, TV3, NTV7, 8TV, TV9, TVi, TV Alhijrah, and BNC News. Analogue broadcast is scheduled to be phasing out in stages by 3rd quarter of 2019. Langkawi become the first area of analogue television switch off that were executed on 21 July at 02:30 AM (UTC+8). Further on 6 August, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Ministry released a complete list of transition date on the remaining areas with central and southern West Malaysia to be commenced on 19 August, northern West Malaysia on 2 September, eastern coast West Malaysia on 17 September and entire East Malaysia on 30 September. The switch over in West Malaysia are fully completed on 16 October at 12:30 AM (UTC+8), while the final switch over in East Malaysia are completed on 31 October also at 12:30 AM (UTC+8) as scheduled.\n\nSatellite\nCable\n\nIPTV\n\nDigital television transition in the Philippines started its planning stage in 2006 after the National Telecommunications Commission released a memorandum on what DTV broadcast standard was to be adopted for the country. The commission decided to have UHF TV channels 14-51 at frequency spectrum 470-698 MHz given over to digital broadcast. The commission opted not to choose the ATSC standard, although the Philippines uses the NTSC-M standard. Instead the country started test trials of two different standards, those being the DVB of Europe and ISDB of Japan. Many broadcasters agreed to adopt the Japanese ISDB but some opted for the European DVB. On June 11, 2010, the National Telecommunications Commission of the Philippines announced that the country would adopt the ISDB standard. The first fully operational digital TV channel in the country is GEM-TV49 of the religious group Iglesia ni Cristo.\n\nWhile the Japanese ISDB-T standard was adopted for terrestrial digital TV transmission, digital cable and satellite TV providers in the Philippines such as SkyCable and Cignal use the European DVB system for service distribution.\n\nThe first phase of digital terrestrial television (DTT) transmission in Saudi Arabia was launched on the 11 June 2006 in the main cities of Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam, the ArabNews reports. Assistant Deputy Minister of Culture and Information for Engineering Affairs, Riyadh Najm, said: \"The southern city of Abha and the central city of Buraidah will also have the facility within this month.\" He added, \"By February next year (20??) the DTT system will cover not less than 23 cities and that accounts for more than 70 percent of the population\". He also said the DTT technology would allow people to receive all the four Saudi channels (Channel One, Channel Two, Arriyadiah and Al Ekhbariya) as well as the Saudi radio programmes (General Programme, Radio Qur’an, Second Programme and European Programme) with better clarity.\n\nSingapore's digital TV (DTV) journey started in 2012 when it was announced that the nation's free-to-air TV channels will go fully digital using the DVB-T2 (Digital Video Broadcasting – Second Generation Terrestrial) broadcasting standard. Since December 2013, all seven Mediacorp channels have been broadcast in digital. All seven of these channels are broadcast in high definition (HD) – Suria, Channel 5, Channel U, Channel 8, Vasantham, Channel NewsAsia, and okto.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, MDA announced that analogue television would cease to broadcast entirely by the end of 2018, up from the intended 19 February 2018, to facilitate more time for majority of Singaporeans to switch to DTV as soon as possible. The analogue broadcast was finally ceased on 2 January 2019.\n\nThe adoption of the DVB-T2 standard was decided after a successful trial that was conducted with free-to-air broadcaster Mediacorp. The trial, which involved some 500 households in Ang Mo Kio and Bedok estates, showed that DVB-T2 was suitable for deployment in Singapore's urbanised environment. DVB-T2 also offers higher efficiency, robustness and flexibility, enabling efficient use of valuable terrestrial spectrum for the delivery of audio, video and data services to fixed, portable and mobile devices.\n\nThe first Television network of Sri Lanka was launched on 13 April 1979. The ITN channel, owned by the Independent Television Network Limited (ITN) became the first terrestrial television channel of Sri Lanka. On June 5, 1979 ITN was converted to a government-owned business and was later brought under the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act of 1982 along with the newly created Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC).\nSignificant changes occurred in 1992 as the government permitted the establishment of private television networks. Subsequently, the MTV Channel network was launched in collaboration with Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel).<br>\nSince then many new television networks have come into existence within Sri Lanka. There are also a number of Satellite networks and pay per view television networks in Sri Lanka. The national telecommunications provider, Sri Lanka Telecom also launched an IPTV service in 2008. MTV Channel had introduced Sri Lanka's first 24-hour Television channel,\"Sirasa TV\" on the 2009 as a thought to satisfy the thoughts of the public to analyse the ongoing global affairs.\n\nDigital television launched terrestrially throughout Taiwan on July 2, 2004. Currently, there are simulcasts of analogue and digital television. Taiwan plans to replace analogue broadcasting with a digital system by 2012. To assist lower-income families with the switch to digital television, the government plans to provide NT$300 million in aid to purchase converters or for the purchase of new digital televisions.\n\nThe first digital television service in Thailand was launched by satellite based pay-TV operator IBC in 1996 using the DVB-S system.\n\nStarting from December 2000, the Thai national broadcaster Modernine TV began its trial Digital Terrestrial Digital Television (DDTV) service for six months to 2000 selected households in the capital city of Bangkok and surrounding areas on UHF Band 658 MHz and 674 MHz (or Channel 44 and 46) using the DVB-T standard. The trial DDTV service will ofcurrent \"current\" 2 analogue TV channels (i.e. Modernine TV and TV3) in digital, and 2 new digital-only channels, namely MCOT 1 and ASEAN TV. Also provided under the service are seven FM radio stations in digital audio and interactive services. Nationwide implementation is planned to begin by the year 2007 or 2008, although as of August 2008 digital transmission is still only available in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and possibly deferred. Even though MCOT's trial was a success, the future of the digital terrestrial television transition has become uncertain, especially after the end of Somchai Wongsawat's tenure as the Prime Minister and the beginning of successor Abhisit Vejjajiva. All the above digital television services are in standard definition and MCOT would have initiated HDTV trials by 2009.\n\nVietnam tested DVB-T in 2003 from a national school in Ho Chi Minh City. A DVB-T channel is launching in 2001 by VTC Digital. DVBT2 was launched in 2011 in Vietnam by AVG - Audio Video Global JSC, now is MobiTV by Mobifone - Vietnam Mobile Telecom Services (from 26/2/2016). Analogue signals switched off on 01/11/2015 in Da Nang, Vietnam. Da Nang is the first city in Asean has launched analogue switch off successfully.\n\nThere are many digital satellite TV services in Australia, these are, Foxtel, Austar, Selectv, Optus, TransACT and UBI World TV. Digital satellite television is popular with Foxtel and Austar alone reaching over one quarter of the nation's population.\n\nDigital terrestrial television in Australia commenced on 1 January 2001, in the country's five most populous cities, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Digital services using DVB-T standards are available nationwide. Analogue transmissions were phased out between mid-2010 and December 2013.\n\nDigital Cable operators in Australia are Foxtel, Neighbourhood Cable in some regional cities in Victoria, and Austar in Darwin. These services are available to the following cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Gold Coast, Canberra, Hobart, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Albury/Wodonga, Mildura and Darwin.\n\nIn New Zealand, there are several forms of broadcast digital television. Sky's Pay TV satellite service (available nationwide), Freeview's free-to-air satellite service (available nationwide), Freeview's free-to-air terrestrial service and multiple IPTV service providers.\n\nSky TV launched New Zealand's first nationwide digital Pay TV service in December 1998 and had a monopoly on digital satellite TV until the launch of Freeview's nationwide digital Satellite service in May 2007.\n\nThe Freeview terrestrial service is a high definition digital terrestrial television service using AVCHD, launched on April 14, 2008. The service currently serves 86 percent of the population - notable large towns without the service include Whakatane, Blenheim, Oamaru and Queenstown.\n\nAnalogue terrestrial television in Albania is supposed to switch off in September 2019.\n\nAlbania has three major forms of broadcast digital television. Terrestrial (DVB-T2) using MPEG4, Cable (DVB-C) using MPEG4 and MPEG2, and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition multiple IPTV services are available.\n\nBelgium now has three major forms of broadcast digital television: Terrestrial (DVB-T/DVB-H), Cable (DVB-C), and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition, IPTV services are available.\n\nIn Belgium, all the regions have completed the analog switchover (DVB-T).\n\nAnalogue terrestrial television was switched off in Croatia on 5 October 2010.\n\nCroatian Radiotelevision (HRT) started to transmit DVB-S programmes in 1997. It transmits all four state-owned TV channels (HRT 1, HRT 2, HRT 3 and HRT 4), and three radio stations (HR 1, HR 2 and HR 3).\n\nCroatia started to test DVB-T transmission early in 2002. It transmitted 4 national TV channels (HRT 1, HRT 2, HRT 3 and Nova TV) on a network of 9 transmitters built by Odašiljači i veze, completed in 2007 and covering about 70% of the country. Entire Croatia is covered with DVB-T in from 5 October 2010. The analogue switch-off process took place region by region, starting from January 2010 in Istria and Rijeka region and completing the switch-off on 5 October 2010 when the final region (Zagreb) was converted fully to DVB-T.\n\nMPEG-2/SDTV is selected as a platform for free-to-air channels, initially with two MUX channels covering, where MUX A would be used by public TV Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) and MUX B used by commercial TV stations, while later MUX C and MUX D will be populated by HD and regional channels, respectively.\n\nCroatia has started transition in 2019 to DVB-T2 HVEC for national broadcast.\n\nAnalogue terrestrial television was switched off on 30 November 2011. \n\nCzech Republic launched first experimental DVB-T broadcast in May 2000, which was then made available to the public in October 2005. There are currently 4 primary multiplexes and 8 regional multiplexes (RS1-RS8).\n\nAs of November 2019, Czech Republic started the transition to the DVB-T2 standard. This transition will be finished on 24 June 2020, when DVB-T broadcast will be terminated nationwide.\n\nAnalogue terrestrial television was switched off in Finland on 1 September 2007, and analogue cable television on 1 March 2008. All pay-TV channels switched to DVB-T2 in May 2017. Finland switches fully to DVB-T2 on March 31, 2020\n\nIn Ireland, there are a number of providers of digital television. These include Sky Ireland which is operated by Sky plc (available nationwide), while Virgin Media Ireland, Magnet Networks and Cablecomm provide various digital-cable services. Digital Television is also available by IPTV provider Magnet Networks.\n\n\nLatvia now has three major forms of broadcast digital television. Terrestrial (DVB-T) using MPEG4 and MPEG2, Cable (DVB-C) using MPEG4 and MPEG2, and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition multiple IPTV services are available.\n\nLithuania now has three major forms of broadcast digital television. Terrestrial (DVB-T) using MPEG-4, Cable (DVB-C), and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition IPTV services are available.\n\nThe Netherlands now has three major forms of broadcast digital television. Terrestrial (DVB-T/DVB-H), Cable (DVB-C), and Satellite (DVB-S). In addition IPTV services are available.\n\nThe shutdown of the analogue service in Norway started on March 4, 2008 and was finished on December 1, 2009. (MPEG-4)\n\nAnalogue broadcast switch-off started on 30 June 2011 and was completed by 31 July 2013.\n\nPortugal started its first digital broadcast with TVCabo Satélite (nowadays known as \"NOS TV Satélite\") in 1998, later, in 2001, implementation of Interactive services brought digital TV to the wired cable networks. While the Satellite branch was (and still is) popular in areas where the Cable branch is not available (such as remote areas and villages), iTV never became successful, and was later discontinued in 2002. Digital broadcast was still available under the name \"powerbox\" (after the STB used to receive the signal). In 2005, a little \"analog switchover\" happened, where coded analog channels (known as Premium) would cease broadcast in favour of powerbox. Every pay-TV provider offers digital television. As of 2010, all Premium channels in all pay-TV providers, are digital. DTT started on November 1, 2008 for Lisbon and Castelo Branco, and on April 26, 2009 for 80% of the country, and the government plans to cover the rest of the country until 2010-2011 New Year's Eve. Analog will then be switched off 6 months after TDT covers 87% of the country via terrestrial transmitters and 13% via satellite complementary coverage.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20161127022323/http://www.tvdigitala.ro/acoperire/\nhttp://www.dvbt.ro/\nhttp://www.radiocom.ro/poze/dvb-t2/Tranzitie%20DVB-T2_Octombrie_2016.pdf\n\nThe transition to digital television in Serbia started on September 1, 2014, and was finished on June 1, 2015. Analogue terrestrial television was finally switched off on June 7, 2015. As of that day, nearly 97.8% of country's population is covered by digital signal.\n\nSlovenia completed its switch to DVB-T (MPEG-4) on the 1st December 2010 with the termination of all analogue transmissions on a single day. There are two multiplexes carried nationwide as well as several local multiplexes.\n\nThe development of digital terrestrial television was very similar to the failure of ITV Digital in the United Kingdom. In 1999, digital terrestrial television was introduced in the country by the pay per view platform Quiero Television. In May 2002, statewide operators were required to start broadcasting in DVB-T. Yet, Quiero TV ceased transmissions in 2002 after a commercial failure. Unlike the UK, the three and half multiplexes left by the platform were not reassigned to other operators, and so 5 channels were squashed into a single multiplex.\n\nOn 30 November 2005, digital terrestrial television was relaunched as a free service with 20 channels and 14 radio stations, along with 23 regional- and local-language channels in their respective areas. Each multiplex has a minimum of 4 SD channels each or one HD channel. By 2010, coverage reached over 98% of the population, and the analog signal was switched off on 2 April 2010.\n\nThe shutdown of the analogue service in Sweden started on September 19, 2005 and was finished on October 29, 2007.\n\nThe United Kingdom now has five major forms of broadcast digital television, direct-to-home satellite services provided by British Sky Broadcasting (branded as Sky) and Freesat, digital cable television services provided by Virgin Media and WightFibre, and a free-to-air digital terrestrial service called Freeview. In addition there are two IPTV systems known as TalkTalk TV owned by The Carphone Warehouse, and BT Vision, which is provided by BT. Individual access methods vary throughout the country.\n\nThe initial attempt at launching a digital terrestrial broadcasting service on November 15, 1998, ONdigital (later called ITV Digital), was unsuccessful and the company went into liquidation.\n\nITV Digital was replaced in late 2002 by Freeview, which uses the same DVB-T technology, but with higher levels of error correction and more robust (but lower-capacity) modulation on the \"Public Service\" multiplexes in an attempt to counter the reception problems which dogged its predecessor. Rather than concentrating on Pay TV services, Freeview uses the available capacity to provide a free-to-air service that includes all the existing five free-to-air analogue terrestrial channels and about twenty new digital channels. All services are transmitted in SDTV mode.\n\nMarch 31, 2004 saw the return of a limited pay-television offering to the digital terrestrial platform with the launch of Top Up TV. This new service is designed to appeal to those who do not want to pay the high subscription fees that Sky Television and the Cable networks demand. The service carries a restricted hours service of some of the UK's most watched channels including the Discovery Channel, Gold, Discovery Real Time, British Eurosport and Cartoon Network, sharing just three different slots. In October 2006, Top Up TV renamed itself Top Up TV Anytime, taking advantage of the increase in the popularity of digital video recorders, and its limited channel space. Now over 100 programs (not channels) are broadcast overnight and added to the box's hard drive, and may be watched at any time. Channels that provide content for the overnight service include MTV, Nickelodeon and Hallmark Channel.\n\n2005 saw the first areas of the United Kingdom losing their analogue signal in a pilot test. The residents of Ferryside and Llansteffan in Carmarthenshire, Wales who had not already upgraded to digital television were given a free set-top box to receive the Freeview television service, which includes Channel 4 (previously unavailable terrestrially from transmitters in Wales) and S4C2, which broadcasts sessions of the National Assembly for Wales. Digital transmissions for this pilot commenced in December 2004, at which time a message was added to the analogue picture advising viewers that the analogue services would end in February 2005.\n\n2005 also saw the announcement by the regulator Ofcom about the proposed analogue switch off plans for the UK. The switch off progressed on an ITV region by region basis that began in 2008 with the Border region, and ended in the UTV region in 2012. The coverage of the three public service broadcasting multiplexes is the same as that enjoyed by the former analogue TV stations (98.5% of the population), while the three commercial multiplexes cover 90% of the population.\n\nThe BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 ran terrestrial HDTV trials involving 450 homes in the London area during June–December 2006 on locally unused frequencies. As part of this trial, the BBC broadcast BBC HD, which was free to air but could not be received by any set-top boxes commercially available at the time. It could however be received and played back by any PC equipped with a DVB-T card using a software H.264 decoder.\n\nWith two channels (BBC HD and ITV HD), Freeview HD completed a \"technical launch\" on 2 December 2009 from the Crystal Palace and Winter Hill transmitters. This time, in addition to H.264 being used as the codec, the broadcast utilised DVB-T2 rather than the DVB-T used by standard Freeview and the earlier test broadcasts, thus requiring users to purchase new reception equipment. Freeview HD was the first operational TV service in the world to use the DVB-T2 standard.\n\nFreeview HD set-top boxes and televisions were made available at the consumer launch of the service in early 2010. In order to qualify for the Freeview HD logo, receivers need to be IPTV-capable and display Freeview branding, including the logo, on the electronic programme guide screen.\n\nOn 25 March 2010 Channel 4 HD was added to Freeview HD on channel 52 with a placeholding caption; it launched on 30 March 2010, coinciding with the commercial launch of Freeview HD. S4C Clirlun launched in April 2010 in Wales, where Channel 4 HD is not available. BBC One HD was also added to the service on 3 November 2010.\n\nVirgin Media (formerly known as NTL:Telewest, after a merger of NTL Incorporated with Telewest Global, Inc.), became in 2006 the first \"quadruple-play\" media company in the United Kingdom, bringing together a service consisting of television, broadband internet, mobile phone and fixed-line telephone services. Virgin Media ranks as the UK's second largest pay TV service, having 3.6m subscribers and 55% national availability.\n\nTrials of the UK's first HDTV service, the TVDrive PVR from Telewest, began on 1 December 2005 on a commercial pilot basis before a full launch in March 2006. Due to the merger between NTL and Telewest, the TVDrive was made available to NTL cable customers in the Teesside and Glasgow areas on 16 November 2006. In January 2007, NTL:Telewest began renting the STB nationwide and since the acquisition of the Virgin Media name, it is now officially available in all areas with the new V+ branding. Virgin Media is also the only cable provider to supply video on demand services.\n\nAs of October 2009, Virgin Media are broadcasting seven HD channels with plans for further new HD channels during 2010.\n\nWightFibre also provide cable television to the residents of the Isle of Wight.\n\nOn 1 November 2005 ITV turned off encryption on all of its satellite-based signals, following the lead from the BBC. These transmissions are on a limited spotbeam which is aimed primarily towards the United Kingdom, via the Astra 2D satellite located at 28.2 degrees east. This theoretically limits reception to Iceland, Ireland and the United Kingdom, allowing ITV to fulfil licensing agreements with content producers. However, many people report successful reception of these signals from across Europe by using larger dishes.\n\nSky+ HD is offered by BSkyB in both Ireland and the United Kingdom as an add-on to their existing Sky subscription service. The BBC is broadcasting BBC HD as a free-to-air channel from the Astra 2D satellite, and the channel can be viewed for free with suitable satellite reception equipment. There are additional equipment and subscription charges for HD from Sky TV but they are broadcasting over 30 channels in the HD format. Sky also offers a free-to-air version of its regular Sky service known as Freesat from Sky. Freesat from Sky provides a non-subscription card for public service broadcast channels Channel 4 and Channel 5, however Film4, Film4+1 are free-to-air.\n\nOn 12 July 2006, the BBC and ITV announced a free-to-air satellite service as a competitor to Freesat from Sky, to be called Freesat. The service was officially launched on 6 May 2008 and covers all BBC and ITV digital TV channels, plus interactive services, radio channels, and other channels. It is being touted as the satellite equivalent to Freeview, especially for areas unable to receive the Freeview DTT service.\n\nThe Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has adopted the same digital television standard for stations in Canada as the United States. The CRTC initially decided not to enforce a single date for transitioning to digital broadcasts, opting to let the economy decide when the switchover will occur. However, a later decision settled on the date of August 31, 2011, limited to 30 markets. In addition, by August 31, 2011, all full power transmitters on channels 52 and above must either relocate to a lower channel or shut down.\n\nCITY-TV was the first Canadian station to provide digital terrestrial service. As of 2007, other digital stations on-air include the CBC and Radio-Canada stations in Toronto and Montreal, as well as CTV's CFTO and CIVT, and CKXT (\"SUN TV\"). This list is not necessarily exhaustive and other station launches are completed or pending, although most are in the largest markets of Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. Also, this does not include digital or high definition versions of specialty channels.\n\nOn November 22, 2003, CBC had their first broadcast in HD, in the form of the Heritage Classic outdoor NHL game between the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens. Bell TV, a Canadian satellite company, Rogers Cable and Vidéotron provide somewhat more than 21 HDTV channels to their subscribers including TSN HD, Rogers Sportsnet HD, Discovery HD (Canadian Edition), The Movie Network HD, and several U.S. stations plus some PBS feeds and a couple of pay-TV movie channels. CTV Toronto broadcast in HD along with its western counterpart, BC CTV. They were also the first to broadcast a terrestrial HD digital ATSC signal in Canada. Global joined the crowd in late 2004. Other networks are continuing to announce availability of HD signals. CHUM Limited's Citytv in Toronto was the first HDTV broadcaster in Canada; however, now most cable and satellite subscribers across Canada can access multiple channels in HDTV with major American and Canadian affiliate stations broadcasting HDTV signals with no CANCON overlay for advertising. Typically these channels are NBC HD, ABC HD, CBS HD, Fox HD, TSN HD, Sportsnet HD, CBC HD, etc., as of summer 2006. CBC HD officially launched their HDTV programming on March 5, 2005. CBC HD broadcasts the first game of their Hockey Night in Canada Saturday double header in HDTV. The 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs games have seen an increased amount of HDTV coverage as well.\n\nMexican television broadcaster Televisa made experimental HDTV broadcasts in the early-1990s, in collaboration with Japan's NHK, but the country moved to implement the ATSC standard like the rest of the North American continent. Today, the vast majority of events and programs are broadcast in high definition. Currently almost all the cable providers as well as SKY the major DTH provider offer HD channels.\n\nBy the third quarter of 2005, HDTV transmissions from TV Azteca were available in Mexico's largest markets: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey. Phase Two of TV Azteca's national roll-out brought HDTV services to six cities along the Mexico-U.S. border (Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Juárez, Mexicali, and Tijuana) by the first half of 2006. This roll-out took advantage of HDTV receivers already in place thanks to an earlier HDTV roll-out by stations on the American side of the border. TV Azteca has also broadcast the Mexican football tournament in HDTV.\n\nXETV in Tijuana, Baja California, is on the air in HDTV using 720p format. This affiliate of the American CW Network is on UHF channel 23 broadcasting from Mt. San Antonio in Tijuana, with 403,000 watts, directed primarily northward at San Diego. In January 2006, Televisa's XEFB-TV and Multimedios' XHAW-TV in Monterrey began HDTV transmissions on UHF channels 48 and 50, respectively. In February 2006, Televisa's XHUAA in Tijuana began its HDTV transmissions on channel 20. Unfortunately they have no HDTV programs. Channel 20 broadcasts an upconverted version of the programs of XHUAA's analog signal on channel 57.\n\nCurrently there are 38 digital channels in Mexico. They are:\n\nThe Analog signal was gradually switched off in 2015 and it no longer exists.\n\nThe analog signal was switched off on 9 January 2012.\nFree-to-air digital terrestrial television using DVB-T is now covering all cities in Greenland, broadcasting TV and Radio stations from the Greenlandic and Danish broadcasting corporations.\n\nSubscription based digital terrestrial television is currently available in the capital Nuuk, Qaqortoq, Ilulissat and Qasigiannguit through Nuuk TV.\nIn addition to channels from Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation, Nuuk TV, and Danish Broadcasting Corporation, the service offers additional channels from C More, and from American and European cable networks (typically subtitled in Danish).\n\nThe United States has adopted ATSC standards for digital terrestrial broadcasts. These standards include standard definition, enhanced definition, and high definition formats. On May 8, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin J. Martin announced that the agency would test run the transition to digital television in Wilmington, North Carolina beginning September 8, 2008. This was in order to work out any kinks which may not be foreseen before most of the country's broadcasters stopped transmitting traditional analog signals and upgrade to digital-only programming. Full-power terrestrial broadcasts using the analog NTSC standard was required by law to cease by June 12, 2009. Some television sets will continue to use analog NTSC tuners if connected to an analog cable system, or a converter box (which may receive digital signals over the air, from a cable system, or from a satellite system). Low-power stations continue to broadcast in analog, but these must transition to digital by September 1, 2015, or go silent. Some Canadian or Mexican border signals may remain available in analog form to some US viewers after the shutdown of US-based full-power NTSC broadcasts.\n\nCosta Rica chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T as 7th country on 25 May 2010,\nand started trial transmissions by Channel 13 from Irazú Volcano on 19 March 2012.\n\nIn the year 2017, the Government of El Salvador adopted the Japanese ISDB-T Platform.\n\nGuatemala approved the use of Digital Broadcasting with the system ISDB-Tb \n\nHonduras was the first country in Central America to adopt a Digital TV standard, ATSC in 2007. Currently there are three digital channels broadcasting: \"TEN Canal 10\" was the first digital TV station in Honduras. It began broadcasting in 2007 in SDTV . CampusTv, is the first high definition TV station in Central America, CampusTv was founded by the University of San Pedro Sula La U Privada. The third channel is \"La UTV\" founded by the National Autonomous University of Honduras.\n\nPanama approved the adoption of the European standard DVB-T to be used for the first time on the 2010 World Cup.\n\nAfter a bumpy ride of back and forths, Argentina officially selected the Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-T International on August 28, 2009, and agreed with Japan to cooperate for resource exchange and technical transfer.\n\nWhile HDTV-ready TV sales are increasing in Argentina, no single HD feed is currently available by terrestrial television as of mid-2009, as the standard selection process wasn't officialized until August 28, 2009. As of this date only a few are available by cable, which are unregulated and use ATSC set top boxes installed at the customers' premises. Subscription TV provider Antina uses the DVB standard to deliver an alternative service to cable TV, using standard definition analog outputs.\n\nIt is expected that the public TV stations begin transition to ISDB-T that the standard for Over-the-air transmissions has been set, and On air service started from 28 April 2010.\n\nAs of September 2011, a few programs are available in 1080i@50 Hz and broadcast by air. That includes most of local football matches and a TV show hosted by Sergio Goycochea (former goalkeeper of Argentina's national football team), all of them on \"TV Pública HD\"; and also soap operas such as \"El Hombre de Tu Vida\", \"Cuando Me Sonreís\" and \"Supertorpe\", on Telefe HD.\n\nBolivia chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T International on 5 July 2010.\n\nThe SBTVD standard (based on the Japanese standard ISDB-T) was adopted 29 June 2006 and launched on 2 November 2007. In 2007, only the greater São Paulo metropolitan area could receive the signal. Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro began to receive free-to-air digital signal on April 7 and April 8, 2008, respectively. On August 4, 2008 and October 22, 2008, Goiânia and Curitiba began to receive DTV signal, respectively. Digital broadcast started at Salvador on December 2 and Campinas on December 3, 2008. The government estimated 7 years for complete signal expansion over all of the territory. Analog television is scheduled to be shut down on October 25, 2017.\n\nThe interactive platform called Ginga consists entirely of free software and received high publicity for being considered the main appeal for the change. The government promised WiMAX as return channel for the system, set to be implemented in the following years.\n\nAll 5 major TV networks (Band, Rede Globo, Rede Record, RedeTV! and SBT) broadcast in HDTV signal (1080i), SDTV 480i and 1seg as well.\n\nTVN has made HDTV tests in 1999, Canal 13 is now broadcasting, in Santiago only, a test transmission in the three HDTV formats (ATSC, DVB and ISDB). In Valparaíso, UCV made ATSC broadcast tests for the Valparaiso area, and Canal 13 also has made tests in DVB format in April 2007 for the Valparaiso area. After rescheduling the date for a final decision on DTV formats several times, The government has stopped offering dates for such an announcement. On September 14, 2009, president Michelle Bachelet announced that the government had finally decided, after prolonged delays, on a digital television standard. Chile will be adopting the ISDB-T Japanese standard (with the custom modifications made by Brazil). Simulcasting is expected to begin in 2010, with a projected analog switch-off in 2017.\n\nOn September 10, 2010, TVN, Canal 13, Chilevisión, La Red, UCV, El Mostrador TV and NGB are transmitting digital signals in Santiago. TVN and Chilevisión tested 3D TV on free ISDB-T channels 30 and 33.\n\nCurrently there are 13 digital channels in Santiago:\n\n\nOn August 28, 2008 Colombia adopted the European digital terrestrial television standard, DVB-T. but on the 9th January 2012 changed this to DVB-T2. All transmissions now use DVB-T2 (6 MHz).\n\nSeñal Colombia —Colombia's state-owned channel— has made digital terrestrial television broadcast tests since 2006, in northwest Bogotá and downtown Cartagena, transmitting into the three DTV formats ATSC, DVB-T and ISDB-T. Also, the Chinese standard DMB-T/H, was considered, but could not be tested.\n\nHDTV-ready television sets (DVB-T) have been available in Colombia since 2003, but cable companies have not broadcast HD content to their subscribers. Satellite television DirecTV Colombia offer HD channels.\n\nPreparations were made to launch DVB-T services in (tentatively) May 2009, when the first DTV transmitter was to go live (probably at Manjui hill in Facatativá). The launch was to initially allow 11 million households in the regions of Bogotá D.C., Boyaca, Cundinamarca, north of Huila, Tolima, western Meta, and probably Caldas and Risaralda to watch DTV services.\n\nOn December 28, 2010, Caracol TV and RCN TV officially started digital broadcasts for Bogotá, Medellín and surrounding areas on channels 14 and 15 UHF, respectively. Señal Colombia and Canal Institucional had started test digital broadcasts earlier in 2010.\n\nThe Spanish , the association for the implementation of digital-terrestrial television and the Colombian government have signed an official agreement under which Spain will help the country implement DVB-T.\n\nEcuador chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T as 6th country on 26 March 2010.\n\nParaguay chose Japanese - Brazilian standard ISDB-T on 1 June 2010.\n\nChosen the Brazilian modified version of the Japanese standard ISDB-T on 23 April 2009. Agreed with Japan to cooperate for resource exchange and technical transfer on 21 August 2009, and On air service started on Channel 7 of TV Perú from 30 March 2010. 1seg is one of attractive system.\n\nAchieved first HD live demonstration and test program transmission using OB Van in aiming nationwide deployment with the Japanese cooperation in Trujillo for 3 days from 28 January 2011.\n\nOn August 27, 2007, the Uruguayan government issued a decree stating that the DVB-T and DVB-H standards will be adopted. While HDTV-ready TV sets are available at the country, a few factors seem to constrain the development of the new technology in the near term:\n\nUruguayan government decided to adopt ISDB-T for geopolitical reasons and to be consistent relations with Argentina and Brazil on December 27, 2010, Uruguayans will start receiving digital television signals by the end of 2012, and scheduling analog signals blackout will be in 2014-2015.\n\nOn October 6, 2009, Venezuela has officially adopted ISDB-T with Brazilian modifications. Transition from analog to digital is expected to take place in the next 10 years. The seven stages of Set-top box manufacturing, testing and implement schedule is well proceeding and will start to deploy DTT from 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188065", "title": "1985 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1985 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1985 Pacific hurricane season is the third-most active Pacific hurricane season on record. It officially started on May 15, 1985, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1985, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1985. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. At the time, the 1985 season was the most active on record in the eastern north Pacific, with 28 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 24 were named, 13 reached hurricane intensity, and 8 became major hurricanes by attaining Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At that time, the 24 named storms was a record; however, this record was broken seven years later in 1992, and was therefore recognized as the second busiest season within the basin, until it was surpassed exactly thirty years later by the 2015 season.\n\nDespite the activity, only one system made landfall in 1985. Hurricane Waldo caused moderate damage in Northwestern Mexico and one death in Kansas. Surf from Hurricanes Pauline and Rick caused minor damage in Hawaii. Hurricane Nele resulted in disruption in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, while Hurricane Ignacio threatened Hawaii, but only ended up producing light rainfall and minimal damage.\n\nThis year, 25 tropical cyclones formed in the eastern north Pacific (140°W to North America). Of those systems, three never strengthened beyond the depression stage, while 22 were named. This total was six storms above the 1966-1985 average seven above the 1971-2006 average and nine above the 1949-2006 average of 13. With a total 26 tropical cyclones and 24 named storms, this season was the most active on record, breaking the short-lived record held by the 1983 Pacific hurricane season, though the 1992 Pacific hurricane season surpassed this record. This season is now the third-most active, being recently also surpassed by the 2015 Pacific hurricane season, which is now the second-most active overall.\n\nOf the named systems, 10 peaked as tropical storms, 12 as hurricanes, and 8 reached the intensity of major hurricanes by attaining Category 3 strength or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The season lasted 170 days, three days longer than the 1984 Pacific hurricane season, but still then days longer than normal. The Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) issued 620 bulletins during the season, 35 more than the previous season. In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (140°W to the international dateline), three tropical cyclones formed. One of those stayed as a tropical depression through its life. One strengthened into a hurricane, and another crossed into the northwestern Pacific before eventually returning to the central Pacific.\n\nAlthough meteorologists expected a below-normal season, the season got on to a fast start though no storms formed in May. The activity picked up significantly thereafter, with five storms forming in June, including one major hurricane and was the most active month of June on record at the time, although this mark was tied in 2018. By the middle of July, a total of 10 storms had formed with another tropical storm forming off the coast of Central America roughly every 10 days. Throughout July, a record seven named storms formed, although this mark was matched in 2015 and 2016. \n\nWithin two more weeks, 13 tropical storms or hurricanes had formed, including 4 major hurricanes. By August 23, 2 more storms had been named. By early September, a total of 17 named storms had developed, 6 of which became hurricanes. Roughly two weeks later, two additional named storms were classified. After a lull in late September and early October, a total of 22 storms had formed by mid-October 21 of which developed in the EPHC's area of responsibility and the list of names was exhausted, forcing the agency to request emergency names.\n\nThe cause of the high activity in 1985 is unknown; however, this year continued a trend of above average season that began in 1981. The hurricane season took place during a La Niña event, which tends to inhibit Pacific hurricane activity. However, 1985 was during a warm phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation and in the middle of an era where all but the 1988 Pacific hurricane season were near or above average.\n\nSeveral storms were investigated by hurricane hunter aircraft in 1985; the first was on July 24 during Hurricane Ignacio. On September 10, a flight was made into Hurricane Rick, where the storms lowest pressure was recorded. Hurricane Sandra was investigated on September 12 on the way from Hawaii, where the hunters were on standby. The final two flights of the season were made on September 21 and 22 into Hurricane Terry while the storm was located off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula. In addition to Hurricane Hunter aircraft, the National Weather Service satellite station provided the basin with adequate satellite converge. The earlier loss of a GOES-East satellite and the move of a GOES-west satellite further west had little effect on EPHC operations. Enhanced infrared imagery was especially useful in determining cold-core centers.\n\nEven though the early season storms were no threat to land, there were several notable storms during the season, with one writer describing the season as the \"worst year ever\". The first storm of series of storms to affect Hawaii, Hurricane Ignacio produced to waves along south-facing beaches. However, rainfall from Ignacio was light. The second storm to affect the state, Tropical Storm Linda dropped heavy rainfall along the windward slopes of the island chain. In early September, Hurricane Pauline came close enough to require a hurricane watch, but the watch was discontinued when Pauline veered north. However, the storm did produced high waves, with amplitudes of to on the eastern side of Puna and Kau. Days later, Hurricane Rick generated high waves; however, the waves were not nearly as high as they were during Pauline. The final storm to affect Hawaii was Hurricane Nele. Due to fears of a repeat from Hurricane Iwa, which struck during the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, a hurricane watch was issued. Although the watch was discontinued when Nele veered west, it later re-curved and struck the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, giving boats a rough night.\n\nThe only storm to make landfall during the year was Hurricane Waldo. Waldo destroyed hundreds of homes in Sinaloa and later produced significant rainfall across the Southwestern United States and Great Plains. One person was killed in Kansas. In addition, two storms affected California. The first, Tropical Storm Guillermo, helped firefighters put out fires during mid-July. The second, Tropical Storm Nora, brought light rainfall to the northern portion of the state in late August.\n\nOn June 1, an area of thunderstorms south of Acapulco developed. It increased in size and, by June 5, was organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm shortly after thereafter. While the \"Monthly Weather Review\" reported that Tropical Storm Andres operationally started out as a tropical depression. the HURDAT database does not give Andres an initial depression stage. Andres headed west, and two days after formation, it reached its maximum intensity of 70 mph (110 km/h) while located south of the Baja California Peninsula. It then slowly weakened as it moved around a weak upper-level high. It weakened to a depression on June 8. The low stayed a depression as it continued west until it dissipated on June 12 as the cyclone gradually increased in speed.\n\nBlanca originated from a tropical disturbance south of Nicaragua. A tropical depression formed on June 6 south of the Mexican coast. Shortly thereafter, it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Blanca. By June 8, the EPHC reported that Blanca had intensified into a hurricane. Blanca fluctuated in intensity for several days, but Blanca did not intensify into a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher, until June 13. After reaching its peak intensity that day with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) later that day, Hurricane Blanca began to weaken. It held on to hurricane strength until June 14, when the agency reported that Hurricane Blanca had fallen to tropical storm intensity. Steadily weakening, Blanca deteriorated into a tropical depression, before dissipating on June 16.\n\nAs a precaution, maritime operations were closed in the western states of Colima, Guerrero and Michoacan. Travel on the high seas and along the coast was also restricted.\n\nCarlos originated from a tropical disturbance moving that was moving westward along the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The wave developed into the third tropical cyclone of the season at 1800 UTC on June 7. Due to weak steering currents, the depression moved north and then south, which subsequently resulted in a very small cyclonic loop. By 0000 UTC on June 10, the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm Carlos; at the time, the storm also attained its maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). However, six hours later, Carlos weakened back to a tropical depression. Thereafter, the storm accelerated somewhat, and quickly merging with the remnants of Tropical Storm Andres at 1800 UTC on June 10.\n\nA disturbance located south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec moved westward along 10°N between June 24 and June 25. After interacting with an upper trough, the disturbance strengthened, and by the following day, it developed into the fourth tropical depression of the season at 0600 UTC. The depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolores late on June 27. Dolores strengthened further while tracking west-northwestward around the southern end of a deep layer ridge. By 1800 UTC on June 28, the storm had reached hurricane intensity. Thereafter, Dolores continued to steadily deepen, and by 0600 UTC on July 1, the storm peaked as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane. However, due to colder sea surface temperatures and increasing vertical wind shear, Dolores quickly weakened, and by early on July 2, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later that day, the storm further weakened to a tropical depression. At around 1800 UTC on July 5, Dolores dissipated.\n\nEnrique began as a tropical disturbance in the ITCZ west of the larger and very intense Hurricane Dolores. Moving west over water, the system was designated as a tropical depression on June 27. Shortly thereafter, it intensified Tropical Storm Enrique. Turning west-northwest, the storm moved over slightly warmer water. Despite this, Enrique never strengthened beyond 40 mph (65 km/h) winds, and entered the CPHC's warming responsibility on July 1. Turning west beneath a ridge, Enrique rapidly weakened to tropical depression status. On July 4, the shallow and weak system turned slightly south of west. Enrique had dissipated by July 5. Despite its weak intensity, moisture carried by the system caused a few localized heavy showers on the windward side of the Big Island of Hawaii on July 5 and over the Kona slopes throughout the night hours of July 5 and 6.\n\nA tropical disturbance moved westward across the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 1. At 1200 UTC on the following day, the disturbance was classified as Tropical Depression Six, while centered about south of Acapulco. Early on July 3, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fefa, while moving parallel to the Pacific coast of Mexico. Fefa approached hurricane status and peaked as a 70 mph (110 km/h) tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 4. However, thereafter, the storm began weakening as a short-wave trough in the westerlies moved into northern Mexico, which caused increased wind shear on Tropical Storm Fefa. Additionally, colder sea surface temperatures over the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula further weakened Fefa. By 1800 UTC on July 6, Fefa dissipated. At the time of dissipation, the low while located about east of La Paz.\n\nThe origins of Guillermo were from a tropical disturbance that formed within south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Moving rapidly west-northwest over moderately warm water, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was centered south of Acapulco on July 7. Roughly 24 hours later, the storm intensified slightly, enough to warrant an upgraded into Tropical Storm Guillermo. Tropical Storm Guillermo moved northwest at almost around the southwest side of a high pressure area over Central Mexico. Passing north of Socorro Island, Guillermo attained its maximum intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) during the evening of July 9.\n\nShortly after its peak, Guillermo began to weaken rapidly due to a combination of strong wind shear and waters. By 1800 UTC, most of the thunderstorm activity had dissipated and only a weak low-pressure area remained. Based on this, Guillermo was downgraded into a tropical depression. Finally, Guillermo turned west and ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone on July 12. The remnants of the storm brought light rainfall to the mountains and valleys of California, helping re-fill dry reservoirs and put out large fires.\n\nTropical Depression Nine developed at 0000 UTC on July 18. Initially, the depression tracked northward due to weak southerly flow associated with an upper-level high centered near the southern tip of Baja California Sur. By 0000 UTC on July 19, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilda; the storm reached its maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) at this time. Thereafter, Hilda turned westward. Due to sea surface temperatures of only , Hilda began to weaken and it dissipated on 1200 UTC July 20.\n\nJimena originated from a tropical wave that moved across Central America and southern Mexico on July 18 and 19. Located along the northern edge of the ITCZ, a tropical depression formed by July 20. Initially moving west, the depression turned west-northwest and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Jimena early on July 21. Jimena attained hurricane intensity two days later. Hurricane Jimena remained a Category 1 hurricane for roughly another day, only to undergo a burst of intensification despite being above marginally warm ocean temperatures. The storm attained peak wind speed of 130 mph (215 km/h) while located roughly southwest of Cabo San Lucas.\n\nAfter maintaining peak intensity for 12 hours, Jimena turned northwest, and respectively began a slow decline. Jimena fell below hurricane status on 1800 UTC July 26. Tropical Storm Jimena was downgraded into a tropical depression late on July 27. Jimena was no longer considered a tropical cyclone by July 29, as its center had dissipated over fairly cold water.\nA tropical depression was spotted early on July 21 while located southwest of San Diego. Situated over warm waters, the depression attained tropical storm intensity a couple hours later. Ignacio reached winds of 70 mph (140 km/h) on July 22, roughly 24 hours after formation, and subsequently entered the CPHC's warning zone. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Ignacio at daybreak on July 22, and thus upgraded Ignacio into hurricane status. Continuing to rapidly intensify, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft discovered that Hurricane Ignacio had reached its peak wind speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) and an estimated central pressure of . Operationally, Ignacio was believed to have peaked as a Category 5 hurricane. Shortly after its peak, the environment was rapidly becoming less conductive. By the evening on July 24, Ignacio was no longer a major hurricane. The hurricane resumed its westerly course, and Ignacio was re-assessed as a tropical storm on July 26. Passing south of the island chain, Ignacio dissipated on July 27.\n\nOn July 24, a high surf advisory was issued for east-facing shores of Hawaii; subsequently, a hurricane watch was issued the next day for the Big Island. Roughly 24 hours after the watch was issued, it was cancelled though a small craft advisory remained in effect for the Hawaiian Islands. Ignacio resulted in to surf, peaking midday on July 25. Rainfall from the storm was generally light though many secondary roads that lead to the beaches were closed.\n\nA tropical wave crossed the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 27 and developed into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 29. While tracking west-northwestward between , the depression slowly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kevin at 1800 UTC on July 31. Crossing marginally warm sea surface temperatures, Kevin maintained tropical storm intensity while tracking westward. However, by August 5, vertical wind shear began increasing, which was generated by an upper-level trough. As a result, Kevin weakened to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on August 6 and dissipated 12 hours later.\n\nA tropical wave formed on July 28 over fairly warm water. Moving west-northwest, the system was declared a tropical depression far from land the next day. It became Tropical Storm Linda later on July 29. Kicking off all the time for no reason and demanding respect without any logical explanation as to why she deserved it, is how the name Linda was granted to this natural disaster. A relatively weak cyclone, Linda peaked as a moderate tropical storm at 1200 UTC on July 31. Shortly after its peak, Tropical Storm Linda began to weaken over cooler waters and increased wind shear. Linda began to weaken and was downgraded into a tropical depression on August 2. Two days later, it passed into the CPHC's area of responsibility.\n\nUpon entering the warning zone, the tropical depression was moving slowly toward the northwest and within six hours, Tropical Depression Linda began to re-intensify. On August 4, the storm had regained tropical storm status. Subsequently, Linda reaches its secondary peak with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Linda remained a tropical storm for about 24 hours before it started to weaken again on August 5. It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day. Meanwhile, Linda turned west under the influence of northerly trade winds. The depression came within of South Point, Hawaii, before dissipating early on August 9. Some heavy showers associated with the outer rainband's of the low fell on the windward slopes of the Big Island of Hawaii and Maui, where rainfall totals of were recorded.\n\nA tropical disturbance crossed the coast of El Salvador and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 3. After moving westward over sea surface temperatures of , the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1800 UTC on August 6, while centered about southwest of Acapulco. While tracking west-northwestward at about , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Marty at 1200 UTC August 7. Further strengthening occurred and Marty became a hurricane on 0000 UTC August 9. However, after 18 hours as a hurricane, Marty weakened back to a tropical storm as it began tracking across colder sea surface temperatures. Early on August 13, Marty weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated later that day at 1800 UTC.\n\nA tropical disturbance detached from the ITCZ on August 18. While tracking across an area of sea surface temperatures of , the disturbance slowly intensified and the EPHC reported that the system had developed tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 19. Initially, the depression remained weak, though by 1200 UTC on August 21, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nora. Thereafter, Nora turned northwestward toward a deep-layer low pressure area offshore of California. During this time, the storm began to weaken due to a decrease in sea surface temperatures. Nora weakened back to a tropical depression on August 22. Nora began to dissipate at 1200 UTC August 23 over waters. Meanwhile, low-level clouds began to enter the storm's circulation. The high-level outflow associated with the storm moved northward and then eastward, resulting in light rainfall in Northern California on August 22 and 23.\n\nOlaf originated from a disturbed south of Acapulco on August 21 over extremely warm waters. Moving slowly west, the EPHC reported that a tropical depression formed on August 22. The depression attained tropical storm status the next day, and subsequently began to rapidly intensify. While turning northwest, Olaf became a hurricane south-southwest of La Paz. It headed west-northwest, and reached its peak intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane late on August 26, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h).\n\nHurricane Olaf then moved slowing towards the west beneath a ridge and into progressively cooler waters. Olaf weakened into a tropical storm on August 28, and then degenerated into a tropical depression the next afternoon. Tropical Depression Olaf suddenly turned north towards an upper-level through off the U.S. West Coast. However, hostile conditions caused the system to cease to exist as a tropical cyclone early on August 31 several hundred miles west-southwest of San Diego, California.\n\nA small, westward moving area of thunderstorm activity become the 17th cyclone of the season. Turning southwest between an upper-level high over Baja California and a low near the southern coast of Mexico, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Pauline. Over the next couple of day, the cyclone turned west, and then west-northwest. Slowly strengthening despite underneath warm waters, Pauline attained hurricane intensity on September 7. Subsequently, Pauline turned towards the south. After peaking in intensity as a moderate Category 1 hurricane, the system crossed into the CPHC's area of responsibility.\n\nIt remained at hurricane intensity for three days. Shortly thereafter, Pauline began to weaken and turn northwest away from Hawaii. Due to interaction with trough, the hurricane veered north into an environment of strong wind shear. The result was rapid weakening; Hurricane Pauline was downgraded to a tropical storm late on September 8 and a tropical depression well north of the islands the next day. Pauline ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone by the evening hours of September 9. However, the remnants of Pauline moved northwest into an area of low pressure of the Gulf of Alaska. A recognizable circulation in the low level flow was visible for several days as it drifted westward far to the north of the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nHurricane Pauline threatened the islands enough to prompt the issuance of a hurricane watch on September 6. Around this time, officials drew plans to evacuate coastal residents and 100,000 people were asked to make emergency preparations. Instead, Pauline turned away from the islands and the watch was cancelled. However, Pauline did cause high surf along the east facing shores of all the Islands. up to surf was measured along the Big Island, Puna, and Kau coastlines. As a result, some roads were temporarily closed due to washed debris.\n\nThe origins of Skip were from a disturbance that passed well south of Hawaii in late August. The CPHC monitored the disturbance for several days and was classified as Tropical Depression Two-C on August 30. Two-C crossed the International dateline the next day and into the western Pacific. Initially moving west, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Skip at 0900 UTC September 9. A Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough then steered tip to the north and later towards the northeast. It underwent two strengthened phases. Skip reached typhoon intensity on two occasions, the first on September 1 and the second on September 7. The system subsequently recrossed the dateline as Skip was rapidly weakening and gaining extratropical features. Shortly thereafter, Skip was declared extratropical despite still producing hurricane-force winds. The typhoon briefly threatened Wake Island.\nA tropical wave that moved slowly westward over the warm waters south of Salina Cruz. Moving westward, the EPHC upgraded the low into Tropical Depression Eighteen on 0000 UTC September 1. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Rick midday on September 2. Initially, further intensification was slow; the storm did not attain hurricane status until the low was located away from land. After becoming a hurricane, Rick began to intensify more rapidly. Early the next day, the EPHC re-assessed the intensity of Rick to Category 4 status. Shortly thereafter, Rick reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h). Operationally, it was believed to be much stronger, with winds of 170 mph (275 km/h), equivalent to Category 5 strength.\n\nFollowing a path similar to the one Pauline made a few days earlier, the powerful hurricane moved northwest. A weakening trend commenced on September 10; Hurricane Rick began to rapidly deteriorate. On September 11, Tropical Storm Rick merged with the same trough though weak low-level circulation persisted for several more days. Early forecasts noted uncertainty in the storm's path and meteorologists noted the potential to be more of a threat to Hawaii than Pauline. The hurricane approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Hurricane Rick turned north sooner than Pauline, the surf did rise somewhat.\n\nDuring the late evening of September 4, a large intense area of thunderstorm activity formed near the Guatemala-El Salvador coast. The thunderstorm developed a circulation about 24 hours later, and was thus upgraded into a tropical depression a few hundred miles south of the Mexican coast. Turning west-northwest over waters, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Sandra early on September 7. By 0600 UTC September 8, winds had increased to 75 mph (120 km/h), and Sandra was upgraded into a hurricane. Sandra turned west, and quickly intensified, reaching Category 3 status later that day after bypassing the Category 2 stage. On 0000 UTC September 9, Sandra peaked in intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h).\n\nAfter moving towards the west for an additional 18 hours, it subsequently began a sharp turn northwest and later west-northwest due to an intensifying trough off the west coast of Baja California. Meanwhile, Sandra slowly weakened. At 1746 UTC September 12, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft intersected Hurricane Sandra after being on standby in Hawaii. The aircraft penetrated Sandra twice, reaching the level. It also measured surface winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a surface pressure of . The eye was reportedly open to the west with low-level banding, and the eye was in diameter.\n\nShortly after the flight, the cyclone then began to turn to the west and weaken further over waters. Sandra was downgraded into a tropical storm the next day; however, the storm briefly regained minimal hurricane status. On 1800 UTC September 14, Sandra weakened back into a tropical storm roughly west of the Baja California Peninsula. Now over sea surface temperatures, Sandra weakened into a tropical depression on September 15 and dissipated two days later.\n\nA tropical wave moved through Nicaragua on September 14. Moving rapidly west over warms, a circulation became evident and tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC September 15, the twentieth of the season. The system turned northwest; subsequently, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Terry 24 hours after formation approximately south of Acapulco. Early on September 25, Terry attained hurricane status. Terry quickly reached Category 2 status and briefly reached Category 3 intensity, peaking with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on September 21 over south of Cabo San Lucas.\n\nShortly after its peak, a cold trough moved southward into Baja California Norte. This steered Hurricane Terry northward into cooler waters. A U.S. Air Force weather reconnaissance aircraft investigated the weakening Terry on 1800 UTC September 21 and 22 while the storm was west-southwest of the peninsula. Two penetrations were made in both flights. The second flight suggested that the hurricane had a poorly defined eye. A combination of cooler water and increased wind shear took its toll on Terry. The system weakened into a tropical storm at 0600 UTC September 23 due west of the Baja California Peninsula, and a tropical depression early the following day. By 1800 UTC, Terry dissipated while its center dissipated west-southwest of San Diego. The hurricane at one point in time was predicted to make landfall in central Baja California and threaten San Diego; however, this did not occur.\n\nA disturbance emerged from the northern ITCZ on September 17. By 0600 UTC on the following day, it developed into a tropical depression. Initially, the depression tracked northwestward in response to a strong upper-level trough centered over northern Baja California. After crossing an area of sea surface temperatures in excess of , the depression was able to strengthen into Tropical Storm Vivian at 0000 UTC on September 20. Under the influence of Hurricane Terry and an upper-level high pressure, Vivian turned west, southwest, and eventually southward. While tracking to the south, the storm re-entered the ITCZ, which caused Vivian to weaken and become indistinguishable. Vivian was downgraded to a tropical depression on September 21, shortly before dissipating on 1800 UTC on that same day.\nTropical Depression Twenty-Three formed from a disturbance on October 7. In a favorable environment over warm waters, It rapidly intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity the same day it formed. Tropical Storm Waldo then began to turn to the north and while located south of Baja California Sur, Waldo was upgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. A trough started re-curving Waldo towards the Mexican coast. Shortly after peaking as a Category 2 hurricane, Waldo made landfall southwest of Culiacán. Waldo rapidly dissipated over land and eventually merged with a cold front.\n\nPrior to the arrival of Waldo, the Mexican Army was put on standby in the event the Fuerte River flooded. While no deaths or injuries were reported, much farmland and 600 houses were destroyed. The Juarez River bursts its banks, flooding at least eight neighborhoods in Culiacán. Telephone service in Los Mochis, Guarmuchil, and Guasave was cut when a communications tower was blown over. A total of 10,000 people were left homeless across the state.\n\nIn combination with a cold front, Waldo contributed to major flooding in Kansas that forced many rivers and creeks to overflow their banks. One indirect death was reported and roughly 15 people were evacuated from their homes in one town. In Kansas City, Waldo produced of water on roads, but none of the nearby homes received extensive damage. The Sedgwick County, the county fire department freed 35 trapped people from rising flood waters. Flash floods affected the southern one–third of New Mexico from rainfall associated from Waldo. Damage was estimated between $100,000–$1 million (1985 USD), mostly to crops, roads, and buildings. In all, Waldo's rain was comparable to Atlantic Hurricane Gloria.\n\nThe origins of Nele were from a tropical disturbance to the south-southeast of Hawaii on October 20. The tropical disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three-C while located south-southeast of Hawaii on October 23. Although difficult to observe on satellite imagery, the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Nele early on October 24. Continuing to intensify, the storm tracked northwestward, following a similar path to Hurricane Iwa in 1982 and Hurricane Nina in 1957. On October 25, Nele attained hurricane strength as it turned to the north. On October 26 it attained peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). It entered an area of weaker steering currents due to a nearby trough. This caused concern for the CPHC, who noted that a continued path would result in the hurricane moving through the island chain. Instead, Nele turned to the northwest at a steady pace and instead moved through the Hawaiian Leeward Islands, passing about west of French Frigate Shoals and very near Tern Island. Around that time, reconnaissance aircraft measured winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a pressure of . After passing through the island chain, the storm finally weakened and accelerated towards the north. Nele re-curved to the northeast, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 30.\n\nDue to fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, a hurricane watch was issued for Hawaii. Officials moved beach equipment away from the beach in preparation. About 24 hours after the hurricane watch was issued, it was dropped as Nele moved away from the islands, alongside the cancellation of a high surf advisory. The hurricane produced waves along south-facing beaches. Upon passing through the Leeward Islands, a weather station on Tern Island recorded winds of with gusts of , along with a pressure of . Many fishing boats spent a tough night at French Frigate Shoals due to high waves and seas. One vessel was partially disabled due to a broken rudder and required assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard. Another vessel reported winds of hurricane-force and to . Other fishing vessels near Maro Reef and Laysan Island had an easier time as they were in the weaker left of the hurricane.\n\nTropical Depression Twenty-Four developed at 0600 UTC on October 25, in the southwest quadrant of a quasi-stationary deep-layer mean anticyclone. The depression moved generally westward and slowly strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Xina about 72 hours after becoming a tropical cyclone. Thereafter, the storm curved northwestward and gradually intensified, and by late on October 28, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Xina then rapidly deepened, peaking as a 115 mph (185 km/h) Category 3 hurricane at 1800 UTC on October 29. However, due to decreasing sea surface temperatures, Xina almost immediately began to weaken.\n\nShortly thereafter, the storm curved eastward, later followed by a south-southwestward turned early on October 31. Later that day, Xina was downgraded to a tropical storm. At around 0600 UTC on November 1, the storm had further weakened to a tropical depression. Xina briefly re-strengthened to a tropical storm at 0600 UTC on November 2, though it quickly weakened back to a tropical depression about six hours later. After weakening back to a tropical depression, the circulation of Xina became very disorganized and difficult to locate. Early on November 4, the depression curved southwestward, and by 0600 UTC on November 5, Xina had dissipated.\nOf the four tropical cyclones that did not reach tropical storm strength, the first was a weak disturbance that began to develop in the northern Intertropical Convergence Zone on July 10. After convection increased and a circulation formed, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Eight at 1800 UTC on July 11. However, deep convection quickly began to diminish, and by early on the following day, the depression dissipated.\nThe only tropical depression to develop in the CPHC's area of responsibility developed from a disturbance embedded in the trade wind flow south of the Hawaiian Islands that was about south of the Hawaiian Islands. A tropical depression was declared on August 20 as the system appeared to be intensifying while moving rapidly west-northwest. However, increased wind shear from a trough, an elongated area of low pressure, took toll on the storm and it weakened on August 21 near the Johnston Atoll. Due to the lack of a well-defined atmospheric circulation, the storm ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone two days after formation.\n\nAn area of convection within the ITCZ developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-Two at 0000 UTC on October 1. However, the depression never separated from the ITCZ. Despite sea surface temperatures in excess of , the depression did not strengthen, and on the following day, the center became ill-defined and difficult to locate on satellite imagery. Convection began decreasing, and as a result, the depression is estimated to have dissipated at 1800 UTC on October 2. Over a month later, a weak disturbance located about southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur developed a circulation; the system was promptly classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-Five at 0600 UTC on November 21. The depression drifted slowly southward at 3 mph (5 km/h), shortly before curving west-southwestward. Thereafter, the depression turned north-northwestward and dissipated later on November 21.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1985. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1991 season, although the name Dolores was misspelled as Delores in 1991. This is the same list used for the 1979 season, except for the added names. Storms were named Kevin, Linda, Marty, Nora, Olaf, Rick, Sandra, Terry, Vivian, Waldo, and Xina for the first time in 1985. The name Pauline was previously used in the 1961 and 1968 seasons respectively.\n\nBecause of the level of activity, these names were added during the season: Later during the 80's, the added names were made a permanent part of the Eastern Pacific lists, and other names were added for even-numbered years.\n\nOne name from the Central Pacific list was used - Nele. It was the first usage for this name. One storm, Typhoon Skip, formed in the central Pacific but did not receive a name until it reached the west Pacific.\n\n\n"}

His first training was from his father . He went to the Vienna Academy in 1738, but his artistic inheritance is really from the great Viennese sculptor Georg Raphael Donner (1693–1741). He taught at the Vienna Academy from 1751 to 1754. One of his pupils at the Vienna Academy was Franz Xaver Messerschmidt (1736–1783). His later work possesses classical character. \n\nIn 1739 he decorated the pulpit of the Church of the Servites in Vienna with monumental figures, representing the virtues of Faith, Love and Hope. The statuettes in walnut and stained ivory, now on display in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, served as model for the pulpit, and show already his virtuosity. He made a funeral monument for general count Leopold Daun (died 1766) at the wall of the George chapel in the Augustinian church in Vienna.\n\nHe was used initially at the Viennese court for the design and manufacture of floats and showy sledges. He was soon to become the leading sculptor in the Late Baroque art of courtly representation.\n\nHis work in Vienna includes about twenty tombs of the Habsburg imperial family in the Imperial Crypt, especially his masterpiece, the elaborate double sarcophagus in Rococo style of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband Emperor Franz I Stephan on which Moll worked from 1751 to 1772. The life-size imperial pair lie on the tin lid, awakened from their sleep of death by the Trumps of Doom. The two look at each other while a putto behind them holds a garland of stars above them. The reliefs on the sides of the sarcophagus depict important scenes of their lives : the ceremonial entrance in Florence as archduke of Tuscany, his coronation in Frankfurt am Main, his coronation in Prague as King of Bohemia, and the coronation ceremony in Bratislava of Maria Theresia. Of the four corners of the sarcophagus, grieving statues show the crowns and blasons of their most important titles : Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Bohemia and Jerusalem.\nHe also worked on the sarcophagi of emperor Karl VI (with the famous skull with the crown of the Holy Roman Empire), his wife the empress Elisabeth Christine, and emperor Joseph I.\n\nHe decorated numerous Austrian churches, palaces and castles with statues, bas-reliefs and crucifixes. He also participated at the decoration with statues of the Triumphal Arch for Emperor Leopold II at Innsbruck.\n\nHe produced the 1781 equestrian statues of that emperor Franz II that stands in the Burggarten and of field marshal Joseph Wenzel Fürst Liechtenstein. The marble statue of emperor Franz Stephan von Lotharingen in the Belvedere is also attributed to him. He is also the sculptor of some gravestones in the Stephansdom cathedral.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188076", "title": "1984 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1984 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1984 Pacific hurricane season was a very active season, producing 21 named storms. When Fausto became a tropical storm on July 3, it was the earliest the sixth named storm was named. This record would be tied in 1985 and broken 34 years later. The season produced 26 tropical cyclones, of which 21 developed into named storms; 13 cyclones attained hurricane status, of which three reached major hurricane status. The season officially started on May 15, 1984, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1984, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1984. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when the vast majority tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Douglas, which attained Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the open Pacific.\n\nOnly four tropical systems made landfall during the season. In September, Hurricane Norbert took an erratic path before making landfall on Baja California as a tropical storm, bringing flooding rains. Hurricane Odile also made landfall on Mexico during September as a tropical storm, killing 21 at sea and severely damaging crops. Additionally, Hurricanes Genevieve and Polo struck Mexico as tropical depressions. Hurricane Douglas also threatened Hawaii.\n\nThere were 18 tropical storms in the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center’s (EPHC) area of responsibility (AOR) this season. Twelve became hurricanes. Of those, six became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center’s (CPHC) AOR, there was a major hurricane and two tropical storms. There was one tropical depression that did not strengthen into a storm.\n\nThe first storm of the season formed on May 17 and the last storm dissipated on November 5, spanning 173 days. While this was much shorter than 1983, it was still two weeks longer than the 10 year average. During the season, there were a total of 1187 storm hours and 1048 hurricane hours, both of which were well above normal. A total of 585 advisories were issued by the EPHC, nearly 200 above normal.\n\nAlma, a short-lived storm, developed from a tropical disturbance that later strengthened into Tropical Depression One-E on May 17. It continued strengthening until May 19, when it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alma, the first tropical cyclone and named storm of the season. Alma hit its peak intensity of a strong tropical storm of 60 mph (95 km/h) later that day. Moving due west, On May 21, it was downgraded into a depression. Later that same day, Alma was declared dissipated as it degenerated into an open trough.\n\nOn May 28, a tropical depression formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Moving west, the storm was located underneath waters. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. On May 30, Boris strengthened into a hurricane, the first of the season, and reached its peak intensity with winds. The next day the hurricane weakened into a tropical storm and began executing a loop in response to a building ridge. Boris soon weakened to a tropical depression. After traversing cooler waters of , the depression dissipated into a remnant low on June 5. However, on June 12, its remnants redeveloped into a tropical storm. In response to an upper-level trough, Boris began to move to the north. However the trough weakened and Boris subsequently began moving to the west, over cooler waters, and dissipated on June 18.\n\nHurricane Cristina formed from a tropical disturbance southwest of Acapulco on June 17. Moving west due to a combination of a weak westerly-moving upper-level low and a subtropical ridge, the storm intensified into a tropical storm on the same day. Cristina continued to gradually intensify before reaching peak intensity with winds on June 19, a mid-level Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane began moving to the northwest in response to a high-pressure area and weakened into a tropical storm on June 22. Cristina intensified to become a hurricane for a second time on June 24. Cristina eventually dissipated June 26 after bring high clouds to the Baja California Peninsula for a few days.\n\nA disturbance off the coast of Mexico had no significant convection until June 25, when it strengthened into Tropical Depression Four-E. As it strengthened into a tropical storm, it received the name Douglas. It strengthened into a hurricane the next day. It hit its peak intensity of a Category Four on the SSHS on June 28. The next day, Douglas weakened into a category 3, then a category 2 late the same day. It later weakened into a tropical storm on July 5, then on July 6, the storm met its demise as it dissipated. Douglas was the strongest storm of the season. Its remnants brought rain to Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii.\nA tropical disturbance developed roughly south of Salina Cruz. Several hundred miles southwest of Acapulco, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on June 28. Moving northwestward, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Elida 24 hours later. Rapidly intensifying, Elida eventually peaked as a powerful category 4 hurricane. Shortly after its peak, Elida moved over waters as its motion slowed. Hurricane Elida later began to turn southwest, then south, and then east as it interacted with Hurricane Fausto and Genevieve. By that time, Elida was only a tropical depression. On July 9, Elida dissipated as a tropical cyclone.\n\nThis tropical depression failed to develop.\n\nA weak tropical disturbance entered the Pacific on July 1. Moving over a pocket of waters, it rapidly intensified into a tropical storm on July 3. Fausto slowly turned northwest into an area between two strong troughs. Late on July 8, Fausto reached hurricane intensity. Continuing to rapidly intensify, Fuasto attained peak intensity of 110 mph (175 km/h) south of La Paz. Hurricane Fuasto continued to move northwest, weakening as it encountered progressively cooler waters. During the afternoon of July 8, the EPHC downgraded Fausto into a tropical storm. Fuasto turned west on July 9 in response to a ridge north of the cyclone. Shortly thereafter, Fuasto was downgraded into a tropical depression, and the system dissipated the next day. Fausto brought high clouds to southern Baja California Sur for four days.\n\nGenevieve was a major hurricane that moved northwestward off the west coast of Mexico, existing from July 7–14, when it dissipated over the southern Baja California peninsula.\n\nThis tropical depression moved north-northwest out of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).\n\nHernan was a short-lived and weak tropical storm which had no effects on land.\n\nIselle was a powerful category 4 hurricane, but the storm never affected any land.\n\nJulio was a storm which did not have any impacts on land.\n\nHurricane Keli was a major hurricane that threatened Johnston Atoll enough to prompt an evacuation. However, intense shear disintegrated the cyclone. There was no damage.\n\nKenna was a weak tropical storm which did not affect land.\n\nTropical Depression Fourteen-E crossed the 140 longitude, and became Tropical Storm Lala. Lala, along with Iniki of 1992, Li of 1994, Lana of 2009, Ela of 2015 & Ulika of 2016 are the only six Tropical Storms to be named in the Central Pacific, but form in the Eastern Pacific.\n\nLowell was a hurricane that did not impact land.\n\nMoke had uncertain beginnings, as it developed from a cold-core low that eventually became a tropical storm just east of the dateline. It passed close to Kure Atoll, encountered shear, and lost tropical characteristics.\n\nHurricane Marie dissipated off the coast of Baja California. Its remnants recurved and brought minor levels of rain to California.\n\nThis tropical depression formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.\n\nThis tropical depression formed along the coast near Zihuatanejo, Mexico from the remnants of the Atlantic tropical storm Edouard.\nA tropical depression first developed on September 14 over the Pacific Ocean west of the Mexican coast. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Norbert. Norbert reached hurricane status on September 16, and shortly thereafter Norbert became a hurricane. On September 17, Norbert was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher). Meanwhile, Norbert meandered. At 0000 UTC, September 21, Norbert reached its peak intensity of . Shortly after its peak, Hurricane Norbert began to turn to the northwest.\n\nNorbert fluctuated in intensity over the next few days. On September 23, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft intercepted Norbert, marking the first time that the core of a hurricane was completely mapped in 3-D. The aircraft was also equipped with Doppler weather radar. Although the hurricane's motion accelerated, by September 25, Norbert was only a Category 2 hurricane. After weakening back into a tropical storm early on September 26 and subsequently ashore near Point Abreojos in the central portion of the Baja California Peninsula while a high-end tropical storm. Norbert eventually became one of the eight tropical cyclones to survive into Arizona.\n\nDescribed as \"big and ugly\" by meteorologists, a combination of Norbert and several other storms left many people without a home and hotels nearly empty. Scattered and light rainfall fell across portions of Baja California Norte and Sonora Sustained winds of were recorded in the Tucson metropolitan area, but only moderate rainfall occurred throughout south-central to northeast Arizona.\nA tropical disturbance was noted about south of Acapulco on September 16 and was classified as a tropical depression the next day. About 24 hours after developing into a tropical cyclone, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Odile. By the afternoon of September 19, Odile became a hurricane while meandering south of the Mexican coast.\n\nLate on September 21, Hurricane Odile reached its peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h). While maintaining peak intensity for a half of a day, the cyclone began to turn more northwestward and weaken over cooler waters. The hurricane weakened to tropical storm status while approaching the coast of Mexico. By late on September 22, Odile made landfall about northwest of Zihuatanejo, as a weak tropical storm, with winds of . Less than six hours later, Odile became an extratropical cyclone, which was at 0000 UTC on September 23. The remnants of Odile moved northwest to the east of Manzanillo before weakening as it re-curved towards Texas.\n\nHeavy rainfall was recorded across Southern Mexico, with the maximum rainfall totals in Costa Azul and Acapulco. Due to an extended period of heavy rainfall, flooding resulted in damage to about 900 homes, inundation of about of highways, triggered an evacuation of 7,000 people, and left 20,000 families without any water service. About eighty percent of the crops in the state of Guerrero were damaged. Commercial flights in Acapulco were suspended for two daybecuase airline terminal was flooded by more than of water. In addition, Hurricane Odile knocked down two high-tension towers. Overall, the hurricane killed 40 people, and hundreds more were missing, and left thousands homeless.\nAs a tropical depression, Polo made landfall in the extreme southern part of the Baja California Peninsula on October 3.\n\nA tropical depression formed on October 7, several hundred miles south of Mexico. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rachel on October 9, as it continued westward into the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. Rachel was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 11, as it began to turn northwest. The depression then dissipated in open waters on October 16.\n\nSimon was a moderately strong tropical storm which did not affect land.\n\nThis tropical depression quickly formed and dissipated over cool water.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1984. This was the first time all of these names were used since the modern lists began. No names were retired, so the list of names was used again in the 1990 season. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.\n\nThree names from the Central Pacific list were used - Keli, Lala, and Moke. This was the first usage for all of these names.\n\n\n"}

His mother, Isabelle Fairfax Williams (1869–1940), was a schoolteacher in San Francisco. In 1921 Cone enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, originally intending to be an illustrator. Eventually he graduated with a degree in English. Due to a problem with his credentials, Cone got a job as an advertising clerk with the \"San Francisco Examiner\" rather than a teaching fellowship. In 1928, Cone left the paper for an advertising agency, thus embarking on a career that would leave an indelible mark on his life.\n\nAfter a year with the L.H.

He is best known for his work as penciller on titles such as \"The New Titans\", \"The Adventures of Superman\", \"Superboy\", \"Power Company\", \"Robin\", \"New Thunderbolts\" and \"Heroes\".\n\nTom Grummett began providing finished artwork over George Pérez's layouts on \"The New Titans\" #58 (Sept. 1989). He worked with Marv Wolfman and Pérez on the \"A Lonely Place of Dying\" storyline which introduced Tim Drake as the new Robin. Grummett remained on \"The New Titans\" after Pérez's departure and helped Wolfman revitalize the title. He began a long association with the Superman franchise when he drew \"Action Comics\" #665 (May 1991) and then helped writer Louise Simonson and artist Jon Bogdanove launch a new title, \"\" in July 1991. Grummett drew part of \"The Adventures of Superman\" #480 (July 1991) and became the main artist on that series with the following issue and then worked on the \"Panic in the Sky\" crossover in 1992. During his run on \"The Adventures of Superman\", Grummett and writer Jerry Ordway (along with editor Mike Carlin, Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern and others) were the architects of \"The Death of Superman\" storyline, in which Superman died and was resurrected. It was during that storyline, that Grummett and writer Karl Kesel, created the new Superboy in \"The Adventures of Superman\" #500 (June 1993). Grummett drew parts for DC Comics' other major event of the early 1990s, \"\", contributing parts of \"Knightquest\" and \"KnightsEnd\". Grummett launched an ongoing \"Robin\" series in November 1993 with writer Chuck Dixon and a \"Superboy\" series three months later with writer Karl Kesel. In Summer 1995, writer Roger Stern and Grummett created a new quarterly series, \"\". He was one of the many artists who contributed to the \"\" one-shot in 1996 wherein the title character married Lois Lane. Other work for DC included collaborating with Chuck Dixon on a \"Secret Six\" one-shot (Dec. 1997) as part of the Tangent Comics imprint and co-creating the \"Power Company\" series with writer Kurt Busiek in 2002.\n\nIn 2000, Grummett and his former \"Superboy\" collaborator Karl Kesel created \"Section Zero\" as part of the Gorilla Comics imprint at Image Comics. Gorilla Comics was intended to be a creator owned company financed by a comics related website, eHero.com. The website proved to be a financial failure, leaving the creators to personally finance their own books. Along with the other Gorilla Comics creators, Kesel and Grummett attempted to continue the series they started, but these efforts proved to be unsuccessful. In January 2012, Kesel announced that he and Grummett would be relaunching \"Section Zero\" as a webcomic on the Mad Genius Comics website.

The area is renowned for its beautiful tropical islands, excellent diving and snorkelling, coral reefs and WWII wrecks, ecotourism lodges, and head-hunting shrines. The province contains many small lagoons and most of the country's tourist trade outside Honiara.\n\nThe Methodist Mission in the Western Province was established by Rev. John Frances Goldie in 1902. He dominated the mission and gained the loyalty of Solomon Islander members of his church. The relationship with the colonial administrators of the British Solomon Island Protectorate were also fraught with difficulty, at this time due to Goldie's effective control over the Western Solomon Islands. From 1927 to 1934 Dr Edward Sayers worked at the Methodist mission where he established a hospital at Gizo, and also at Munda and Vella Lavella, and carried out fieldwork in the treatment of malaria. It is also renowned as where the American Navy ship commanded by John F. Kennedy was bombed and sunk by the Japanese during the Second World War.\n\nThe provincial capital is Gizo, a town of around 3000. There are airports at Gizo, Munda, Seghe, Viru, Ramata, Gatokae, Ringgi Cove, Barakoma & Balalai.\n\nThe Western Province is considered the tourism mecca of the Solomon Islands, and is by far the most accommodating area, with multiple hotels and resorts, dive shops, ecotourism attractions restaurants, and boat tours.\n\nMunda, the largest town on New Georgia island, has a landing strip built during WWII by the US and is listed as an emergency landing runway, capable of handling even jumbo jets.\n\nThe diving in the Western Province is pristine as tourists tend to visit nearby Fiji for diving rather than visiting the less developed Solomon Islands. Also, malaria is a concern in the Solomons, which keeps many tourists away. The result is spectacular dive conditions with untouched coral reefs. Munda, Uepi, and Gizo are considered some of the Western Province's best dive locations. The region supports some of the highest coral and fish diversity in the world.\n\nThe Western Province and nearby Choiseul Province were significantly affected by 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake, an 8.1 magnitude earthquake that struck on April 2, 2007 and an associated tsunami. It caused 100+ significant (in excess of magnitude 4.0) aftershocks. The official death toll was 52 with several thousand persons displaced, most of the displaced are expected to be living in temporary shelters for a minimum of between 6 and 9 months. The island of Ranongga to the west of Gizo was uplifted by around 2.5 – 3 metres resulting in the death of its fringing reef and also opening massive fissures in the island itself. Reefs around Munda and Uepi were largely unaffected by the tsunami and earthquake.\n\nWestern Province is sub-divided into the following wards:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2188101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188101", "title": "1983 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1983 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1983 Pacific hurricane season was the longest season ever recorded at that time, which was later surpassed by the 2015 and 2016 seasons. It was a very active Pacific hurricane season. The season started on May 15, 1983 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1983 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. During the 1983 season, there were 21 named storms, which was slightly less than the previous season. Furthermore, twelve of those storms became hurricanes. And eight of the storms reached major hurricane status, or Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS). The decaying 1982–83 El Niño event likely contributed to this level of activity. That same El Niño influenced a very quiet Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe first storm of the season, Hurricane Adolph became the southernmost-forming east Pacific tropical cyclone on record after forming at a latitude of 7.1°N. After a slow start, activity picked up in July, when Hurricane Gil moved through the Hawaiian Islands, resulting in moderate damage. In early August, Hurricane Ismael was responsible for three deaths and $19 million (1983 USD) in damage. During early September, Hurricanes Kiko and Lorena brought significant damage and seven deaths to southern Mexico. About a month later, Tropical Storm Octave became the worst tropical cyclone on record to affect Arizona. Octave killed 15 people, and caused $500 million in damage to Arizona and $12.5 million to New Mexico. Later in October, Hurricane Tico was a very intense hurricane at the time of its landfall and thus left 25,000 homeless. Damage throughout the country was estimated at $200 million while 135 deaths were reported in Mexico. Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants brought significant flooding in the Central United States, resulting in six deaths and $42 million in damage. A few days later, Hurricane Raymond posed a threat to Hawaii, but did little actual damage. The final storm of the season, Hurricane Winnie, was a rare December cyclone.\n\nDuring the 1983 season, a total of 21 named storms formed, which was well-above the long-term average of 15.\nHowever, this total was slightly less active than the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, which saw a then-record 22 storms form. However, 1983 was at that time the most active season in the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) warning zone, but this record itself was surpassed during the 1985 Pacific hurricane season, and again in the 1992 Pacific hurricane season. Additionally, 12 storms reached hurricane intensity, which was above the average of eight. Of the 12 hurricanes, eight attained Category 3 intensity or higher on the SSHWS. The season started on May 21 with the formation of Adolph and ended on December 9, with the dissipation of Hurricane Winnie. Lasting 201 days, 1983 was the longest season on record. There were a total of 1,238 storm hours, which was the most in four years. Despite the activity in the EPHC's warning responsibility, only two storms formed in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC)'s area of responsibility, both of which stayed depressions. A moderate El Niño was present throughout the season, with water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific was nearly 5 °F (0.6 °C) above normal. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period. Both of these factors are known to enhance Pacific hurricane season activity. Furthermore, 1983 was in the middle of an era where all but the 1988 Pacific hurricane season was near or above average.\n\nOne storm in 1983 formed in May, an event the occurs every other year on average. Another storm formed in June, which was below the average of 1.7 storms per June. Despite a somewhat slow start, activity picked up in July, where 6 storms formed. This was twice the average, though only two of the storm thus far had exceeded hurricane intensity. Although August was less active, with only 3 storms developing, compared to the average of 4, two of the storms that formed in July lasted into the early part of the month. However, activity picked back up again in September, with 5 storms forming, which was above the average of 3. Three storms also formed in October, which was two storms above normal. One storm developed in November as well, a somewhat unusual occurrence. For the first time since 1947, a hurricane developed in December.\n\nThree storms during the season made landfall on Mexico. The first, Adolph did so in May. The second, Tico, hit near Mazatlán as a powerful hurricane, resulting in severe damage. Around this time, a weak tropical depression made landfall along the western portion of the nation as well. In addition, Tropical Depression Raymond made landfall on Hawaii in late October. Hurricane Hunters flew into 2 storms within the EPHC zone (Manuel and Ismael). Moreover, they flew into 3 storms in CPHC's area of responsibility, Tropical Storms Gil and Narda, and Hurricane Raymond.\n\nOn May 21, a tropical depression formed southwest of Managua, at a latitude of 7.1°N, becoming the southernmost-forming tropical cyclone in the east Pacific basin. As the depression headed gradually west-northwestward over extremely warm sea surface temperatures, it steadily intensified. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adolph. Further intensification occurred as Adolph headed west-northwestward; by May 24, the EPHC reported that Adolph had strengthened into a hurricane, setting a then-record for the earliest known hurricane in the basin, though this was later surpassed by Hurricane Alma in May 1990. Shortly thereafter, the storm turned northwestward and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane on the SSHWS. Around that time, Adolph attained its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) as the storm briefly developed a well-defined eye. At that time, Adolph was the strongest May hurricane on record. However, this record was broken by a hurricane in 2001 that was also named Adolph.\n\nFollowing peak intensity, Adolph gradually weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. By May 25, Adolph curved sharply north-northeastward, as a result of being steered by anticyclonic deep-layer mean. Despite being situated over fairly warm waters, Adolph weakened considerably due to increased wind shear. Although the EPHC expected the storm to stay at sea, Adolph curved north-northeastward. It was then downgraded to a tropical storm on May 25. Rapidly weakening, Tropical Storm Adolph moved onshore near Puerto Vallarta early the next day. After briefly moving offshore, it again made landfall near Mazatlán at 0800 UTC that day. Adolph soon dissipated over land, becoming the first of two storms to strike the Pacific coast of Mexico during the season. Because Hurricane Adolph weakened significantly prior to landfall, no deaths or major damage occurred. However, the remnants of the storm brought heavy showers and gusty winds to Florida. Although a modern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15, one newspaper considered Adolph a \"pre-season\" storm.\n\nA tropical disturbance was first observed in early June about south of Guatemala, and headed westward. The tropical disturbance intensified, and became the second tropical depression of the season on June 9. After staying a tropical depression for 24 hours, the system was subsequently upgraded to Tropical Storm Barbara. Initially, Barbara was expected to come very close to the Mexican coast; however, this failed to happen. At first, Tropical Storm Barbara moved west-northwest, though on June 11, the cyclone turned west-northwest while gradually gaining intensity. At 1800 UTC on June 12, Barbara was estimated to have attained hurricane status while centered north of Clipperton Island. Shortly after becoming a hurricane, rapid deepening commenced, and by early the next morning, the hurricane was a high-end Category 1. Six hours later, Barbara skipped Category 2 status, and became a major hurricane. At 1800 UTC on June 13, Hurricane Barbara was upgraded into a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS while its peak strength of 135 mph (215 km/h). At peak, Barbara had a \"fantastic eye\".\n\nHurricane Barbara held on to peak intensity for a day. Thereafter, Barbara slowly weakened after peak intensity as it began to encounter cooler water temperatures, while moving slowly northward around the western edge of a high pressure area over central Mexico. By the early morning hours of June 16, the hurricane was positioned west-southwest of Socorro Island and about west of the coast of Mexico. Later that day, Barbara weakened into a tropical storm due to strong wind shear. Barbara was downgraded to a tropical depression early on June 17. Further weakening persisted, and Barbara dissipated on June 18. At the time of dissipation, the system was situated several hundred miles west-southwest of the Baja California peninsula.\n\nA westward-moving low-latitude tropical disturbance was declared a tropical depression early on July 2. After making a turn northwest, the depression maintained its intensity for 42 hours. By 1200 UTC on July 4, the system was finally upgraded into a tropical storm after convection increased in coverage. However, Cosme failed to intensify further, and after encountering cooler waters, the storm rapidly dissipated. The EPHC declared Cosme dissipated at 1800 UTC on July 5.\n\nAn intense area of thunderstorms developed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 4. The system was first classified as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on July 5 roughly south-southeast of Acapulco. Turning west-northwest and then northwest while accelerating, the EPHC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Dalilia at 1800 UTC on July 6. Continuing to gain strength, Dalilia reached its peak intensity as a strong tropical storm early on July 8. After turning west the tropical storm started to lose strength while encountering colder water. At 0600 UTC on July 10, Tropical Storm Dalilia had been downgraded into a tropical depression. Two days later, the EPHC reported that the tropical cyclone had dissipated.\n\nTropical Storm Erick originated from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on July 9 and July 10. At 0600 UTC on July 12, the EPHC reported that it had upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression. The depression moved steadily west-northwest under the influence of an anticyclone over the Yucatán Peninsula. The system gradually intensified over waters as warm as and at 0000 UTC on July 13, the agency upgraded the low into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Erick reached its peak intensity on July 14 as a high-end tropical storm. The storm maintained peak intensity for 24 hours, before encountering cooler water. Rapidly weakening, Erick dissipated on July 16 far from land.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed southwest of Manzanillo late on July 16. Several hours later, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression. Initially, the depression drifted southward, but at 1800 UTC on July 17, the system suddenly turned west-northwest and accelerated. The storm gradually intensified while passing northeast of Socorro Island. Midday on July 19, the tropical depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Flossie. Six hours later, Tropical Storm Flossie reached its peak wind speed of . While the storm approached the Baja California peninsula, the storm ultimately turned west into an area of cool water and high amounts of wind shear. By 0000 UTC on July 21, Flossie weakened into a tropical storm. Twelve hours later, Flossie ceased to exist as a tropical cyclone.\nThe seventh tropical cyclone of the season developed during the afternoon hours of July 23 north of Clipperton Island. Thereafter, the EPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gil on July 24. Gil subsequently began to intensify; on 0000 UTC July 26, the storm was upgraded into a Category 1 hurricane. Early on July 27, the storm attained its peak intensity of . Despite turning west-northwest, Hurricane Gil maintained hurricane intensity until July 29 when the storm began to encounter cooler waters. Two days later, Gil was downgraded a tropical depression. After entering CPHC's warning zone on August 1, the CPHC Gil was re-upgraded into a tropical storm. Gil accelerated while approaching the Hawaiian Islands; on August 3, the tropical cyclone reached its secondary peak of . After passing through the Hawaiian islands, Gil passed very close to French Frigate Shoals on August 4 as a marginal tropical storm. Early on August 5, the system was downgraded into a tropical depression and degenerated into a trough about west-northwest of Tern Island later that day.\n\nPrior to arrival of Gil, gale warnings were issued for much of the islands, but on August 2, these warnings were discontinued for all islands except for Kauai. Jellyfish stung 50 tourists. On the northern part of the island, winds were reported, resulting in extensive damage in some areas, but slight damage to others. A minor power outage on the island briefly left 2,400 customers without electricity. In Maui, the outer rainbands of Gil led to minor flooding. Overall, damage from Gil was minimal and less than expected. Offshore, one person was presumed to have died when a catamaran, named \"Hurricane\", went missing. Additionally, the 30-foot ship \"Adad\" nearly sunk in the storm and all three people on board sustained injuries.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed about south of the Guatemala coastline. After developing a circulation, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression on July 27. Moving west-northwest, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Henriette at 1800 UTC that day. Henriette continued to deepen, and by late on July 28, the storm attained winds of . Although initially expected to pose a threat to Hawaii, this did not occur. It rapidly intensified, and late on July 28, the EPHC upgraded the storm into a hurricane. While turning west-southwest on a track similar to Gil's, it attained Category 2 intensity on July 29. At 0000 UTC on July 30, Henriette was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane. After leveling off in intensity, the storm passed within within Clipperton Island. Hurricane Henriette attained its peak intensity early on July 31, with winds of , a Category 4 system. At peak, Henriette displayed a well-defined eye.\n\nAfter continuing west-northwest for 12 hours, it then veered northwest and began to encounter cooler ocean temperatures. Henriette was slow to weaken, and by August 2, it was downgraded into a Category 2 hurricane. Two days later, Henriette was downgraded into a tropical storm. A strong trough of low pressure pulled Henriette northwest, and later north. On August 5, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression. The storm dissipated the next day at a high latitude, though the remnants of Henriette brought cloud cover to Oregon and Washington.\n\nOn July 30 and 31, a tropical disturbance crossed Central America. At a low latitude, a tropical depression was declared on August 3. At first, the storm was expected to turn west-northwest, but it continued west instead. Nine failed to intensify despite being situated over warm water. The depression dissipated on August 7 later over somewhat cooler water.\nThe origins of Hurricane Ismael were from a northward bulge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in early August, which resulted in the formation of a tropical depression on August 8. Six hours later, it was upgraded into Tropical storm Ismael. Continuing to intensity, Ismael was upgraded into a hurricane late on August 10 and subsequently developed an eye. The storm soon reached its peak of . Late on August 11, Hurricane Ismael began to weaken as it encountered cooler waters and the hurricane was soon downgraded to a Category 1 on the SSHWS. The following day, Ismael was downgraded into a tropical storm about west of the Baja California peninsula. On August 14, the storm was downgraded into a tropical depression while centered about west of Point Ensenada. Ismael dissipated that day.\n\nWhile still out at sea, Ismael brought waves to much of Southern California, though waves from the storm were less than expected. One person was swept away at a beach. The remnants of the storm later moved over South California, resulting in moderate rainfall. The Yucca Valley was the worst hit by the storm, where nearly every road was washed out. Almost 50,000 residents in Palm Springs were isolated due to rains. A tornado near Los Angeles led to minor damage. In San Bernardino, many buildings were destroyed, forcing numerous evacuations. Around 80,000 homes were left without power across the Inland Empire. Moreover, three interstates were closed. In all, minor injuries were reported and three people died in San Bernardino when their car swept into a channel. Damage from the storm totaled $19 million (1983 USD). After affecting California, the remnants of the hurricane moved into Nevada. Many parking lots in Laughlin were flooded. Two small towns were also isolated. Several major streets in the outskirts of Las Vegas were closed because of flooding.\n\nThe eleventh cyclone of the 1983 season formed from an intense area of thunderstorms located over the Yucatán Peninsula on August 11 and 12. After crossing the Mexican mainland, it emerged into the Pacific basin near Guadalajara early on August 13. After turning northwest, it intensified into a depression two days later after showing sign of a circulation. The depression continued northwest with little change in wind speed, and on August 16, about 24 hours after formation, the depression dissipated after its circulation ceased very close to landfall on the Baja California peninsula.\n\nTropical Depression One-C formed on August 19 far from land, with winds of . It moved steadily west. Despite being over warm waters, One-C quickly weakened and lost deep convection. The depression dissipated on August 20 after briefly developing a closed circulation.\n\nTropical Storm Juliette originated from a tropical depression that first formed on August 24 east-northeast of Clipperton Island. Moving west-northwest and briefly west, the depression gradually intensified. The system then turned northwest around a ridge off the west coast of Baja California Sur. At 1800 UTC on August 26, the EPHC announced that the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm. Moving toward a strong trough off the west coast of the peninsula, Juliette reached its peak intensity as a mid-level tropical storm early on August 29, with winds of . Upon attaining peak intensity, Juliette developed an eye. However, Juliette began to weaken over cooler water. Meanwhile, the trough weakened and Tropical Storm Juliette headed west. On August 30, the EPHC remarked that Juliette was downgraded into a depression. Two days later, Tropical Depression Juliette had dissipated over cold water.\n\nA disturbance in the ITCZ developed a circulation on August 29 and organized into a tropical depression two days later. Traveling west-northwest, Two-C was initially in a favorable environment, and was thus expected to become a tropical storm. However, it soon encountered a trough and dry air, which arrested development. It crossed the international dateline on September 1 and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began issuing advisories on the system. The depression gradually weakened and dissipated on September 8. Its remnants lingered near the Marshall Islands for a few more days.\n\nHurricane Kiko originated from a tropical disturbance that crossed Central America on August 26 and 27. After emerging into the Pacific, the disturbance moved steadily westward. At 0600 UTC on August 31, the EPHC classified the system as a tropical depression about south of Salina Cruz. A well-developed ridge was centered over New Mexico and was moving southward, causing light wind shear over the system. At 1800 UTC on August 31, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kiko. Initially expected to turn west and head out to sea, the storm moved northwest while paralleling the Mexican coast. Early on September 1, Kiko began to explosively deepen, and by 1800 UTC, it intensified into a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS, bypassing both Category 1 and 2 status. Six hours later, the EPHC reported that Kiko had intensified into a low-end Category 4. After remaining at this intensity for 30 hours, the hurricane resumed intensification, attaining its peak intensity of late on September 3 about west of Lázaro Cárdenas.\n\nShortly after its peak, a combination of cooler waters and increased wind shear associated with the subtropical jetstream resulted in rapid weakening. Hurricane Kiko was soon downgraded to Category 3 status on the SSHWS, before briefly re-intensifying on September 4. That day, Kiko resumed weakening and was downgraded to a Category 2 as the storm turned west-northwest away from the Mexican coast. On September 5, the storm was downgraded into a Category 1 system; by this time, the EPHC revised their forecast and expected the storm to accelerate and approach Baja California. On September 7, Kiko weakened into a tropical storm. Subsequently, the system turned north and was downgraded to a tropical depression the next day. Now devoid of convection, Kiko dissipated early on September 9 about west-southwest of Baja California.\n\nThe outer rainbands of Hurricane Kiko caused considerable damage to homes and hotels situated near the coast of Mexico, forcing the evacuation of hundreds. The resorts of Tecomán and Manzanillo were the worst hit by the storm. Outside of Colima, however, little damage was reported. Kiko brought high clouds to the extreme southwestern portion of the Baja California Peninsula for four days. While at sea, Hurricane Kiko was responsible for waves along Newport Beach, California, resulting in more than 100 lifeguard rescues. As a weakening tropical system, Kiko brought subtropical moisture and high clouds to California.\n\nTowards the end of the first week of September, the next cyclone of the season was starting to form south of the Mexican coast. A disturbance moved westward and was classified as a tropical depression about south of Acapulco early on September 6. Like Kiko, the storm deepened rapidly, and was upgraded into a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day. Initially moving very slowly, the storm made a sharp turn northwest, parallel to the coast of Mexico. Accelerating, a poorly defined eye first became visible on satellite imagery around 1500 UTC on September 7. The EPHC upgraded Lorena into a hurricane three hours later. Early the next day, Lorena intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. At 1200 UTC on September 8, Lorena attained winds of a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS; simultaneously, the storm reached its peak intensity, with winds of .\n\nAfter maintaining peak intensity for six hours, Lorena began to weaken over cooler waters. Very early on September 9, the EPHC downgraded Lorena weakened into a Category 1 hurricane; the storm was expected to emerge into the southern Gulf of California in about 48 hours and thereafter meander. However, this did not occur. Meanwhile, Lorena was re-upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane, an intensity of which it held on to for 12 hours. After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Lorena moved west-northwest and into a low wind shear environment. Subsequently, Lorena attained its secondary peak with winds of while passing about south of Cabo San Lucas. However, cooler water began to take its toll on the storm and on September 12, the storm was downgraded into a Category 1. Later that day, Lorena weakened into a tropical storm due to a combination of strong shear and cold sea surface temperatures. Midday on September 13, the EPHC downgraded the system into a tropical depression. Furthermore, the system dissipated 18 hours later. At the time of dissipation, Lorena was centered about west-southwest of San Diego.\n\nHurricane Lorena brought rough surf and squally weather to much of the coast of Mexico, particularly Manzanillo. Furthermore, it was also responsible for $33,000 in damage to Acapulco. Seven people died due to flooding. Four ships drowned in the storm; as a result, many local ports were closed. In addition, a mudslide blocked a portion of the Pan-American Highway.\n\nA vigorous tropical disturbance was first noted on September 10 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Despite the presence of wind shear, the EPHC upgraded system into a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on September 12 and a tropical storm at 1200 UTC that day while centered around south of Puerto Escondido. Manuel reached hurricane strength early on September 14. Several hours later, Manuel reached a secondary peak wind speed of . However, this trend was short lived, and very early on September 15, the storm's wind diminished to , only to reintensify again that evening. Early on September 16, Manuel turned towards the north while developing a small eye. Hurricane Manuel maintained winds of for a day before the EPHC upgraded Manuel into a Category 2 hurricane. On September 17, however, Manuel developed a much larger and well-defined eye; that afternoon; Manuel reaching its peak intensity of as a major hurricane.\n\nThe storm held onto major hurricane winds for 12 hours before subsequently weakening. At 0000 UTC on September 18, the eye collapsed as it began to encounter colder ocean temperatures. Manuel was intercepted by a Hurricane Hunter aircraft that day, which found no evidence of an eyewall, thus, Manuel was downgraded into a tropical storm about south of San Diego. After turning north-northeast, Hurricane Hunters penetrated the storm for the second time, noting that the storm was a swirl of clouds. On September 19, the EPHC downgraded the system into a depression. The following day, Manuel made landfall along the eastern portion of Guadalupe Island before dissipating at 1200 UTC.\n\nThe remnants of Hurricane Manuel later brought rain to the southwestern United States. The outer rainbands of Manuel began to produce moisture over the region on September 18, and continued until September 21. In the mountains and deserts of California, the storm brought heavy rains across. A laboratory near Palm Springs recorded a peak rainfall total of . A total 3,000 customers lost electricity in Porterville because of high winds, heavy rains, which led to minor damage. Numerous fires occurred in Kern County, but none of these fires caused major damage. Further east, in Arizona, isolated rain showers were reported, peaking at at the Alamo Dam. Along the northern portion of Baja California, Manuel brought showers and high waves. In all, impact from the storm was less than anticipated.\n\nSeveral hours after Manuel dissipated on September 20, a tropical disturbance formed south of Socorro Island. While situated south of a ridge, the disturbance started to deepen. After developing a circulation, the system was declared a tropical depression the morning of September 21. Later that morning, the EPHC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical storm. Narda held on to marginal tropical storm intensity for 36 hours before quickly intensifying, and by September 23, the storm had attained winds of . Thereafter, the storm turned west-northwest and weakened steadily after encountering cooler water. On September 26, the EPHC downgraded Narda into a depression. After accelerating, the storm entered the CPHC zone the next day.\n\nTropical Storm Narda then began to encounter slightly warmer waters, and thus began to restrengthen. At 1800 UTC on September 27, the CPHC announced that Narda had regained tropical storm strength. It quickly intensified and early on September 29, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of and the formation of an eye. At this time, Narda was located about southeast of Hilo. That evening, the storm start to show signs of weakening as it turned southwest away from the Hawaiian group. On September 30, however, Narda, with winds of , made its closest approach the Hawaii, passing south of South Point. After briefly intensifying on October 1, it suddenly dissipated hours later.\n\nBecause of data from tropical cyclone forecast models, which showed Narda passing very near the Hawaiian islands, and fears of a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, a hurricane watch was posted for all the Hawaiian Islands at 0700 UTC on September 28. Gale warnings and high surf advisories were issued for the entire state. Officials urged many Hawaiians to complete preparations by the night of September 28. Campers at coastal parks were also ordered by police to find shelter on higher ground. However, the hurricane watch was discontinued after Narda veered away on September 29. Meanwhile, gale warnings and high surf advisories were dropped that day for all islands except for the Big Island. The outer rainbands of Narda brought locally heavy rain to the state. Flooding was reported of eastern areas of the Big Island. Nine families were evacuated to shelters. Higher than normal surf was also observed on southeast and east facing beaches. Overall, damage from Narda was minor.\nA tropical disturbance formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 23, which moved west for four days prior to attaining tropical depression status. Initially, the depression was situated over warm waters; however, wind shear subsequently increased in the vicinity of the storm. However, on September 28, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Octave. Six hours later, Octave attained its peak intensity of and decreased in forward speed while turning to the northeast. On September 30, began to weaken due to cooler waters and increasing vertical wind shear. At 1200 UTC on October 2, the EPHC issued their last advisory on the storm, as the surface circulation had dissipated.\n\nDue to the threat for flooding, local flood warnings were issued for much of Arizona. In the end, the highest rainfall associated with Octave was at Mount Graham. Throughout the state, excessive rainfall caused many rivers to overflow. The Santa Cruz, Rillito, and Gila rivers experienced their highest crests on record. Runoff from both the Rillito and Santa Cruz rivers flooded Marana. Major flooding was reported along the Gila River, and two of its tributaries, the San Francisco River and the San Pedro River. These rains devastated Clifton along the San Francisco River valley. Over 700 homes were destroyed in Clifton. Further south along the Gila River, major flooding was reported in extreme southeastern Arizona. Willcox was nearly flooded. Further west, in Phoenix, 150 people were evacuated from an apartment complex. Throughout the greater Phoenix area, eight fires were started via lighting.\n\nTropical Storm Octave was considered the worst flood in Pima County history. Octave is also regarded as the worst tropical system to affect Arizona. Around 3,000 buildings were damaged due to Octave. A total of 853 structures were destroyed by Octave while 2,052 others were damaged. About 10,000 people were temporarily displaced. Damage in Arizona totaled $500 million. Fourteen people drowned and 975 persons were injured. Elsewhere, in New Mexico, a peak total of of rain was recorded, resulting in flooding. New Mexico governor Toney Anaya declared a state of emergency in Catron County. Damage in New Mexico was estimated at $12.5 million. In Mexico, of rain was reported in Altar. In Sonora, many roads were closed. On October 3, Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt declared a state of emergency. President Ronald Reagan declared eight Arizona counties a \"major disaster area\" on October 5.\n\nWhile Tropical Storm Octave was still active, a tropical disturbance formed on September 29 near Clipperton Island. The disturbance moved northwest, and was upgraded into a depression at 1800 UTC. While moving beneath the southwest side of a ridge, Priscilla steadily intensified. Early on October 3, Priscilla was upgraded into a hurricane. After remaining a Category 1 hurricane for most of the day, it was upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane that evening, and subsequently, began to rapidly intensify. At 0000 UTC on October 4, about 24 hours after first becoming a hurricane, Priscilla was upgraded into a major hurricane, with winds of . While at peak, which it held on for 12 hours, Priscilla displayed a well-defined eye. Additionally, the hurricane began a sharp turn to the north-northwest due to a strong trough off the Southern California coast and the storm was initially expected to move onshore Baja California and bring flooding rains to Arizona.\n\nShortly after its peak, Priscilla began to encounter cooler waters and thus it start to slowly lose strength. During the pre-dawn hours of October 5, Priscilla weakened into a Category 2. Later that day, it was downgraded into a Category 1 system. By 0000 UTC on October 6, the EPHC downgraded the system into a tropical storm. By this time, it was anticipated that the system would make landfall as a tropical system on California. Quickly weakening, Priscilla was downgraded into a depression that day. Early on October 7, Priscilla dissipated about southwest of Guadalupe Island.\n\nDue to the storm's threat to California, flash flood watches were issued for much of the southern portion of the state. In Arizona, heavy equipment was evacuated from flood-prone areas. Along the central Baja California peninsula, showers were reported. While still a Category 2 hurricane, the outer rainbands of Priscilla brought rains to California, resulting in power outages, hail, and traffic accidents. In Los Angeles, a daily rainfall record was set. Some streets in Anaheim and Santa Ana were flooded. The roof of a church was also damaged. Consequently, flash flood warnings were posted for parts of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Offshore, rough seas were generated. Across northwestern Arizona and Nevada, heavy showers and thunderstorms occurred. The remnants of the storm moved over the area on October 7. Rainfall totals were less than expected and most weather stations recorded less than of precipitation. A peak total of was measured in Ely.\n\nA tropical wave crossed Nicaragua on October 5, moving westward. A ridge center\nwas over Mexico and a well-developed ridge extended westward towards the Hawaiian Islands. Despite the presence of strong wind shear, it was upgraded to a tropical depression south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on October 8. The depression moved over waters, intensifying into Tropical Storm Raymond on October 9. Intensifying quickly, Raymond attained hurricane status on October 10. Hurricane Raymond subsequently developed a small but distinct eye. Rapidly intensifying, the storm rapidly moved west. Raymond was upgraded into a major hurricane late on October 10. Raymond reached its peak winds of as a moderate Category 4 hurricane roughly 24 hours after becoming a hurricane. At the time of its peak, the hurricane was located about south of San Diego. Raymond is believed to have held on to peak intensity for almost two days.\n\nThe hurricane subsequently weakened and was only a Category 2 by October 13, but it re-intensified over the next few days. With continued warm waters, the system crossed into the CPHC warning zone, reaching a secondary peak of on October 14 while becoming one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the region. By then, Raymond had begun a movement to the northwest. The eye later became poorly defined while the symmetric shape of the hurricane became elongated. The Hurricane Hunters confirmed the weakening trend, reporting a pressure of . Hurricane Raymond weakened to a tropical storm on October 16 as wind shear took its toll on the storm. Meanwhile, the storm drifted northwest and underwent several loops. Two days later the storm resumed its westward motion as it weakened to a tropical depression. It became devoid of deep convection, and made landfall on Molokai on October 20 while still tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, Raymond dissipated inland.\n\nBecause meteorologists were predicting that the storm may pose a threat to the Hawaiian island group, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for Hawaii. A high-surf advisory also was issued. As Raymond approached Hawaii, the cyclone kicked up very high surfs that pounded the big island. On the east end of the Hawaiian Island chain was battered by waves. In addition, Raymond brought beneficial rains and gusty winds on all islands. Precipitation ranged from on Maui. There was one casualty when a sailor, Richard Sharp, was killed overboard off the 44-foot yacht \"Hazana\"; the boat, which was dismasted, was traveling from Tahiti to San Diego, but the course was altered to Hawaii because of the storm.\n\nSituated several hundred miles west of Hurricane Raymond, a tropical disturbance formed on October 8. Moving west-northwest, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression on October 9. After moving west-northwest for 12 hours, it turned west. Despite warm waters, strong westerly wind shear prevented much further development. On October 10, the EPHC upgraded Sonia into a tropical storm. That day, Sonia reached its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h). However, this was short-lived as the thunderstorm activity quickly became displaced from the center. At 0000 UTC on October 11, Sonia weakened into a tropical depression. About 24 hours later, Sonia weakened into a tropical disturbance after it failed to maintain a closed circulation. Thereafter, the storm entered the CPHC's warning zone, where it began to encounter warmer waters and lighter wind shear, and thus began to deepen. On October 13, Sonia regained tropical storm intensity and briefly posed a threat to Hawaii. Despite remaining small and disorganized, Sonia reached its peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h) for a second time that evening. However, outflow from Hurricane Raymond weakened the system and Sonia dissipated on October 14 over south-southeast of the Big Island.\nThe origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October 7. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575 mi (930 km) south of Acapulco. On October 12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October 13. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. By October 16, Tico had reached major hurricane status. Early on October 19, it reached peak winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500 UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). It rapidly weakened over land and merged with a cold front. The remnants of Tico were last observed on October 24 over Ohio.\n\nModerate rainfall was reported around the landfall location, peaking at 8.98 in (228 mm) in Pueblo Nuevo, Durango; lighter precipitation of 1–3 in (25–75 mm) occurred further inland toward the Mexico/United States border. Two 328 ft (100 m) anchored ships were washed aground by strong waves and swells, with a total of seven ships reported missing. Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed. Hurricane Tico was responsible severe flooding and heavy damage due to strong winds. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000 acres (77 km²) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatlán. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. Twenty-five thousand people were left homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200 million (1983  USD). Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135 deaths in Mexico.\n\nRain from Tico continued into the South-Central United States; serious flooding was reported along the lower Washita River. Across Guthire, 5% of the town's population, sought three emergency shelter due to deep water. Throughout Oklahoma and Texas, 200 people were displaced and six people were killed. A total of $77 million in crop damage occurred in Oklahoma. Total damage in the state was estimated at $84 million. Elsewhere, one person was killed in the Kansas.\n\nOn October 18, a tropical disturbance was noted about south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Moving west-northwest, the disturbance was upgraded into a depression. After turning northwest, the depression dissipated an hour before moving ashore. Lasting less than 24 hours, Twenty-Two was the shortest-lived storm of the season. Despite the lack of damage, of rain was measured along portions of the Southern Mexico coast.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed within the ITCZ during October 31. Despite unfavorable conditions, the system began to organize, and became Tropical Depression Twenty-Three on November 1. It quickly intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Velma six hours later. No further intensification occurred; Velma peaked as a minimal tropical storm. The tropical storm began to weaken after 18 hours, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on November 2. The following day, the EPHC issued the final advisory on Tropical Depression Velma.\nDue to a combination of unusually warm sea surface temperatures and the displacement of the ITCZ to north, a small area of disturbed weather formed in early December. Situated south-southwest of Acapulco, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression on December 4. It slowly headed north, and intensified into a tropical storm. Winnie peaked in intensity on December 6, and became the strongest Pacific hurricane in December since records began.. Initially expected to continue north, the storm stalled instead. Due to wind shear caused by a trough, Winnie began to rapidly deteriorate, and it was downgraded into a tropical storm that night. After weakening further into a depression, Winnie dissipated on December 7. Its remnant disturbance then moved west. Winnie was an out of season storm, and is the only known December tropical cyclone in the east Pacific proper since the modern record began in 1949. Winnie is the latest hurricane on record in the eastern North Pacific.\n\nAlthough the tropical cyclone never made landfall, it caused rain in parts of Mexico. The highest total of was recorded in Caleta de Campos. Furthermore, the storm brought strong winds to the region, but damage was less than expected.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1983. All the names on the list were used this year. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1989 season. This was the first time most of these names were used since the modern lists began, except for the name Priscilla which was previously used in the old four-year lists. No central Pacific names were used; the first name used would have been Keli.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188114", "title": "1982 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1982 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1982 Pacific hurricane season, with 23 named storms, ranks as the fourth-most active Pacific hurricane season on record, tied with 2018. It was at that time the most active season in the basin until it was later surpassed by the 1992 season. It officially started June 1, 1982, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1982, in the central Pacific, and lasted until October 31, 1982, in the central Pacific and until November 15, 1982, in the Eastern Pacific. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. At that time, the season was considered as the most active season within the basin; however, the 1992 season surpassed these numbers a decade later.\n\nThe 1982 season was an eventful one. Hurricane Paul killed over 1,000 people before it was named. Hurricanes Daniel and Gilma both briefly threatened Hawaii, while Hurricane Iwa caused heavy damage to Kauai and Niihau. The remnants of Hurricane Olivia brought heavy rain to a wide swath of the western United States.\n\nThis season had twenty-three tropical storms, twelve hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. Three tropical storms and one hurricane— a record number of named storms— formed in the central Pacific. This was largely due to the strong 1982–83 El Niño event, which was present during the season. However, this was surpassed in the 2015 Pacific hurricane season with eight storms.\n\nThis is the first year that named storms forming between the dateline and 140°W were given names from the Hawaiian language. Previous to this year, names and numbers from the western Pacific's typhoon list were used.\n\nAfter this year, it was decided that the six-year lists would be used, instead of the four-year ones. That is why the 1978 season's list was used again this season.\n\nThe origins of Aletta are from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on May 18 about 500 mi (800 km) south-southwest of Acapulco. On May 20, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression. Moving northwest, the depression became Tropical Storm Aletta 36 hours later. The system re-curved towards the northeast due to strong upper-level westerlies, reaching its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) on May 23. Shortly after its peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the system briefly leveled off in intensity for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend. On May 25, Aletta slowed and moved in a large clockwise loop until May 28. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May 29 roughly 180 mi (290 km/h) southwest of Acapulco.\n\nThe outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Aletta produced torrential rains and high winds over Central America for several days, with a peak of in Chinandega. Ninety percent of the banana crop and 60 percent of the corn crop was completely destroyed. Throughout the country, 108 people were killed, Roughly 20,000 people were homeless and total damage was estimated at $365 million (1982 USD); damage to highways, factories, and farms alone exceeded $100 million. In one village, the storm left 270 missing and only 29 survivors. The capital city of Leon was hardest hit by Aletta, which was considered the worst disaster in the country in three years.\n\nAcross Honduras, 200 people were killed and 5,000 people were without food or water 13 communities. A total of 80,000 people were homeless. Total damage was placed at $101 million (1982 USD). Following the storm, soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines. In addition, the U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.\n\nThis system originated as a low in the western Caribbean Sea on the morning of May 27. The next day it moved southwest into Guatemala with significant thunderstorm activity, emerging into the Gulf of Tehuantepec around noon on May 29. By May 31, it was organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. Slowly weakening on June 1 as it remained quasi-stationary, the system dissipated in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 4.\n\nThis cyclone formed well to the west-southwest of Mexico on June 12. The depression slowly recurved due to an upper level low located well to its north-northwest. By June 15, vertical wind shear had taken its toll and the system dissipated about 300 mi (500 km) north of where it formed.\n\nOn June 15, this cyclone formed about 460 mi (740 km) southwest of Acapulco. Drifting west-northwest, it quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. Maximum sustained winds peaked near 50 mph (80 km/h) late on June 15. Turning south of due west, vertical wind shear weakened Bud, with the cyclone dissipating by the morning of June 17 about 23 mi (370 km) north-northwest of Clipperton Island.\n\nLate on June 16, deep convection organized in the Gulf of Tehuantepec into a tropical depression. Transcribing a small clockwise loop, the system moved west-northwest. Interaction with Mexico likely played a role in its weakening as water temperatures under the system were never below 82 °F (28 °C). The system dissipated about 90 mi (150 km) south of Puerto Ángel by the morning of June 19.\n\nA tropical wave crossed Central America on June 26, creating an area of thunderstorms just inside the tropical eastern Pacific that morning. Cyclonic turning was evident by the night of June 30 while located roughly 350 mi (550 km) south of Manzanillo as the system continued westward. Slowly turning northwest, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression early on July 1 and a tropical storm by nightfall. Maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (97 km/h) by noon July 3. Increasingly southwest flow aloft turned Carlotta more northward into cooler waters, causing the cyclone to regain tropical depression status on the evening of July 4, ultimately dissipating southwest of Cabo San Lucas the next evening.\n\nThe system formed between Tropical Storm Carlotta and the Hawaiian Islands on the evening of July 2. Slowly recurving north and northeast, the system moved into cooler waters and dissipated about 100 mi (160 km) north of where it formed by the afternoon of July 3.\n\nTropical Depression Eight-E formed south of Mexico on July 7. Moving west-northwest, the cyclone slowly strengthened into a tropical storm around noon on July 8 before becoming a hurricane late in the afternoon of July 9. Daniel reached its maximum intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) early in the morning of July 11 a few hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As the storm moved westward, it slowly weakened. Daniel regained tropical storm status during the night of July 14, entering the Central Pacific Basin as a weakening tropical storm on the morning of July 16. Daniel retained tropical storm intensity for the next few days before weakening into a tropical depression about 280 mi (450 km) south southwest of the Big Island of Hawaii, being sheared by the same upper trough that caused Emilia's dissipation a few days earlier. Daniel turned northward, and on July 22, dissipated in the Alenuihaha Channel between Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nTropical Depression Nine-E developed near 10.0° N 136.5° W on the morning of July 12. Intensifying, the cyclone became a tropical storm later that day. Emilia moved westward around 13 mph (21 km/h) and entered the Central Pacific Basin on the night of July 12. Over the next day, the storm moved west-northwest, reaching maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (105 km/h). An upper trough to the west weakened Emilia rapidly due to vertical wind shear, and the cyclone weakened to tropical depression status early on the morning of July 15. Dissipation of the tropical depression was noted by afternoon.\n\nTo the east of Daniel, a tropical depression formed on the evening of July 13 a few hundred miles west-southwest of Manzanillo. The system moved westward and weakened thereafter, dissipating about 200 mi (320 km) west of where it had formed by the afternoon of July 14.\n\nA tropical disturbance was spotted about 650 mi (930 km) southwest of Acapulco on July 12. By the evening of July 15, cyclonic turning was evident and the system was upgraded to a tropical depression. Moving unsteadily to the west-northwest, the system weakened, dissipating a few hundred miles west-northwest of where it had formed.\n\nThe cyclone developed as a tropical depression southeast of Manzanillo on July 17. Over the next couple of days, it strengthened rapidly into a hurricane as it moved northwest, peaking in intensity with 75 mph (121 km/h) winds. Gradual weakening occurred as Fabio turned westward along the 19th parallel north into cooler waters, eventually dissipating late on July 24.\n\nTropical Depression Thirteen-E formed near 9.5°N 117°30'W and moved slightly north of west. Tropical storm status was attained near noon on July 26, and the cyclone crossed the threshold of hurricane strength late on the night of July 27. By noon on July 29, Gilma reached it maximum intensity of 125 mph (200 km/h) well to the east-southeast of Hawaii. The cyclone weakened and sped up its motion to the west-northwest, crossing into the Central Pacific Basin as a category one hurricane very early on July 30. Gilma was downgraded to a tropical storm late in the morning of July 30, and a tropical depression early on the morning of August 1 as the circulation passed 50 mi (80 km) south of South Point. The cyclone dissipated late on August 1 as it passed 200 mi (300 km) south of Kauai.\n\nOn July 23, a tropical wave moved off the Colombian coast. The related convection moved westward at over 20 mph (32 km/h). By the evening of July 27, the system slowed its forward motion. The next evening, a tropical depression organized within the thunderstorm activity well to the south of Baja California. Strengthening continued, as Hector became a tropical storm on the morning of July 29 and a hurricane by noon on July 30. A combination of vertical wind shear and cooler waters ahead of the cyclone led to its weakening trend, which hastened on August 1. It weakened to a tropical storm on the morning of August 2 and to a depression soon thereafter while located midway between the Hawaiian Islands and southern Baja California.\n\nA tropical disturbance was discovered 300 mi (460 km) south of Acapulco on July 31. Moving west-northwest, it achieved tropical depression status that night and tropical storm status on August 2 while 800 mi (1,340 km) west-southwest of Acapulco. Northeasterly upper level shear appears to have been Iva's nemesis, as the system weakened back into a tropical depression by the afternoon of August 3 as it turned west-southwest. The depression maintained strength for another several days before dissipating well east-southwest of Hilo, Hawaii, on the morning of August 8.\n\nTropical Depression Sixteen-E formed on August 3 in the East Pacific between Hawaii and Mexico. The system intensified into a tropical storm by noon August 4, and a hurricane on the morning of August 5. John reached its peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) as it moved into the Central Pacific Basin on August 6. Weakening commenced on August 7 due to westerly vertical wind shear caused by the semi-permanent mid-oceanic upper trough, and John weakened to a tropical storm on the night of August 8. It passed by as a tropical depression about 180 mi (290 km) south of the Island of Hawaii, and dissipated late on August 10 to the southwest of Hawaii.\n\nTropical Depression Seventeen-E formed by noon on August 8 in the East Pacific. The low moved west, intensified, and became Tropical Storm Kristy by midnight, and a hurricane by midnight on the night of August 9. Weakening as it entered the Central Pacific, Kristy regained tropical storm status late on August 10 while moving south of due west at a rapid 30 mph (48 km/h). As it slowed down and turned northwest, Kristy began to restrengthen. Hurricane intensity was reached again on the evening of August 13. By noon on August 14, the cyclone passed 250 mi (400 km) south of South Point, Hawaii. Westerly winds aloft slowed Kristy's forward motion down additionally, and Kristy weakened back into a tropical storm on August 15. Turning more to the west with the low level wind flow, the cyclone was downgraded to a tropical depression by noon on August 16 and dissipated that night southwest of Hawaii.\n\nThe originating disturbance of this system emerged off San José, Costa Rica on August 4 and slowly consolidated. By the afternoon of August 8, Tropical Depression Eighteen-E developed well south of Cabo San Lucas. The next morning it had continued strengthening into a tropical storm. Maximum sustained winds reached 60 mph (97 km/h) as it continued moving west-northwest. Vertical wind shear reached Lane on August 10, which led to weakening. It weakened to a tropical depression late on August 11, but sporadic thunderstorm blowups near the center kept the system alive for another few days. Dissipation occurred on the evening of August 14 as it crossed the 140th meridian west.\n\nTropical Depression Nineteen-E formed on August 29 a couple hundred miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression moved west-northwestward, intensifying into a tropical storm by noon on August 30 and a hurricane by noon on August 31. Peak intensity of 90 mph (145 km/h) was attained during the early morning of September 1. For the next couple of days, Miriam remained unchanged in strength. By late on September 3, a weakening trend was realized as it passed into the Central Pacific by the afternoon of September 4. Shearing apart soon afterwards, the low moved northwest and weakened into a tropical depression well to the east of Hawaii on the morning of September 5. It drifted north, and became a nontropical low by September 6. The cyclone was last noted near 30°N 149°W, continuing its northward trek.\n\nTropical Depression One-C formed along the eastern end of the West Pacific monsoon trough on August 30 about 700 mi (1120 km) east of the International Dateline, well to the west-southwest of Hawaii. Moving slowly westward, the system intensified rapidly into a tropical storm by noon and was named Akoni. The name \"Akoni\" is an ʻokina-less spelling of ʻAkoni, which is Hawaiian for \"Anthony\". Maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (97 km/h) late on August 31 as Akoni moved near the ship \"Nana Lolo\" a few hundred miles east of the International Dateline. An upper trough to the northwest set Akoni on a weakening curve, and the cyclone diminished to a tropical depression on the evening of September 1 as it moved with the low level flow. The weakening depression passed the International Dateline into the western Pacific on the morning of September 2. Akoni was the first storm to receive a name from the modern Central Pacific tropical cyclone naming list.\n\nNortheasterly shear slowed the development of the initial tropical depression which formed into Norman. Strengthening began in earnest on September 11, and the cyclone became a tropical storm, and then a hurricane by early on September 13. Maximum sustained winds reached nearly 95 mph (153 km/h) by September 15. A mid-latitude trough dug in from the north, weakening the ridge north of Norman and leading to a northward motion. Increased vertical wind shear and cooler waters weakened the hurricane, with dissipation occurring just west of Baja California on September 18. On September 17 and 18, moisture from Norman brought scattered rain to California and Arizona.\n\nA tropical depression formed well east-southeast of Hawaii late on September 10. Moving over cooler waters soon after formation, the depression dissipated by the next evening near 14°N 134°W.\n\nAn area of convection formed near 15°N 140°W and by September 15, a tropical depression had formed within the thunderstorm activity. Strengthening as it moved slowly north-northeast, the cyclone became a tropical storm late that day. Ema became stationary between the morning of September 16 and September 17 before resuming its north-northeast heading. Its peak intensity was 45 mph (72 km/h). Upper level shear weakened the system into a tropical depression by noon on September 18. As it crossed the 140th meridian west back into the eastern Pacific near the 20th parallel north, the depression dissipated.\n\nAn area of thunderstorms stewed south of the Hawaiian Islands for several days. By September 15, it had organized into Tropical Depression Three-C, and quickly became a tropical storm that afternoon. The cyclone moved north-northwest for a day before slowing to a crawl for the next day. The cyclone turned southwest and weakened into a tropical depression due to vertical wind shear. It dissipated southwest of Hawaii near 13°N 162°W late on September 18.\n\nShip reports indicated that a tropical depression had formed about 400 mi (640 km) south-southwest of Acapulco around noon on September 18. The system drifted north-northwest, developing into a tropical storm that night. About 24 hours later, Olivia became a hurricane. Rapid intensification continued, and Olivia reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) winds around noon September 21, becoming the strongest storm of the season. The next day, waters under the tropical cyclone began to cool as the hurricane gained increasing latitude offshore Mexico. By noon on September 23, the cyclone had weakened into a tropical storm west of Baja California. Strong southwest flow to its north spread precipitation through the western United States into southwest Canada. The cyclone weakened to a tropical depression about 500 mi (800 km) southwest of San Diego and the surface low was last seen dissipating on September 25 about 250 mi (400 km) west-southwest of San Diego.\n\nThe heavy rain in California wiped out half of the raisin crop, a quarter of the wine crop, and a tenth of the tomato crop. Olivia's remnants brought rain totals of over 7 inches (177 mm) to California and northern Utah as they interacted with a strong upper level system and the local topography. The precipitation from this storm largely contributed to the record monthly precipitation in Salt Lake City, Utah, of 7.04 in (179 mm). These rains resulted in widespread losses, mainly from agriculture, amounting to $325 million (1982 USD).\nThe precursor disturbance to Paul originated from an area of low barometric pressure and disorganized thunderstorms, which was first noted near the Pacific coast of Nicaragua on September 15. Five days later, the EPHC classified it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Two. The depression turned northward and then moved inland near the El Salvador–Guatemala border, and dissipated overland. The remains of the depression retraced westward back over the open waters of the Pacific, briefly regenerating into a tropical depression. The depression again degenerated into an open trough on September 22. Two days later, Paul regenerated for the third time. It gradually organized into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC September 25. Two days later, Paul became a hurricane and turned north. As the storm neared Baja California Sur, it reached Category 2 intensity. On September 29, the hurricane crossed Baja California Sur at peak intensity. After weakening slightly inland, Paul made its final landfall near Los Mochis before rapidly dissipating overland.\nThe tropical depression that later became Paul produced the worst natural disaster in El Salvador since 1965. A total of 761 people were killed 312 of which occurred in San Salvador, which also sustained the worst damage. About 25,000–30,000 people were left homeless. Much of San Salvador was submerged by flood waters of up to high, and even after their recession hundreds of homes remained buried under trees, debris, and of mud. In all, property damage from the storm amounted to $100 million (1982 US$) in the country; economic losses were estimated at $280 million (1982 USD). Crop damage was worth $250 million.\n\nIn Guatemala, widespread catastrophic floods claimed 615 lives and left 668 others missing. More than 10,000 people were left homeless as The 200 communities were isolated from surrounding areas. Overall, economic losses of $100 million (1982 USD) were reported in the country. In Nicaragua, Paul killed 71 people and caused $356 million (1982 USD) in economic losses. Throughout southern Mexico, floods from the precursor depression to Paul killed another 225 people. Prior to landfall in the state of Baja California Sur, 50,000 people were evacuated. Furthermore, wind gusts estimated at 120 mph (195 km/h) swept through San José del Cabo, causing property damage and subsequently leaving 9,000 homeless. Despite extensive damage, no deaths were reported in the Baja California Peninsula wake of Paul. In northern Mexico, the greatest damage occurred 70 miles (110 km) south of Los Mochis in the city of Guamuchil; a total of 24 people were killed by the storm statewide, although it produced beneficial rains over the region. Agricultural damage was severe in the state of Sinaloa, with up to 40 percent of the soybean crop destroyed. In all, the state's corn production was down by 26 percent from the previous year. Total storm damage in Mexico amounted to $4.5 billion (1982 MXN; $70 million USD). The remnants of Paul moved into the United States, producing heavy rainfall in southern New Mexico and extreme West Texas. Inclement weather was observed as far inland as the Great Plains.\n\nA well-organized tropical depression formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 30. Moving slowly northwest, the system became a tropical storm, reaching maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) on the afternoon of October 2. The system slowly weakened as it moved northwest, and Rosa brushed the Pacific coast of Mexico as a dissipating depression.\n\nA tropical disturbance was noted southwest of Costa Rica on October 12. Moving west-northwest, the system organized into a tropical depression as it crossed the 91st meridian west late on October 13 and became a tropical storm by October 14 as it entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It strengthened into a hurricane late that day as it passed 95°W. By the afternoon of October 17, Sergio was packing sustained winds of 120 mph (190 km/h). Cooler water was reached soon afterwards, and weakening commenced. While slowly moving west, Sergio weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon of October 21 and to a tropical depression late on October 22. The system dissipated near 19°N 133°W on the afternoon of October 23.\n\nA tropical disturbance emerged off the coast of Central America. Cyclonic turning was noted on the afternoon of October 19, and a tropical depression formed 350 mi (560 km) south of Acapulco. Staggering west-northwestward, the cyclone became a tropical storm by the morning of the October 22. Maximum sustained winds increased to 50 mph (80 km/h) late on October 24. As it moved over cooler waters on October 25, the system weakened to a tropical depression that afternoon, dissipating that night near 21°N 130°W.\nA late-season trough of low pressure developed into a tropical depression and was subsequently upgraded into Tropical Storm Iwa. At first, the After turning to the northeast, Iwa began to slowly intensify, and on November 23, Iwa strengthened into a hurricane. Iwa reached peak winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) late on November 23. Accelerating, Iwa passed just north of the island of Kauai on November 24. After passing the island group, Iwa rapidly deteriorated; late on November 24, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm. On November 25, Iwa became an extratropical cyclone.\n\nDue to the hurricane's rapid motion, storm surge extended 900 feet (275 m) inland. A total of 5,800 people were evacuated in Kauai. In addition, 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu and in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. High winds from Hurricane Iwa briefly left Kauai without power and destroyed most papaya and banyan trees. The hurricane destroyed or damaged 3,890 homes on the island. Rough seas killed a person and left four others injured in Pearl Harbor. In Oahu, damage was heaviest on the southwest side of the island. The passage of the hurricane damaged at least 6,391 homes and 21 hotels; 418 buildings, including 30 businesses, were destroyed on Oahu. In Niihau, 20 homes were destroyed and 160 were damaged.\n\nThroughout the Hawaiian island group, 20 people were treated for injuries. An estimated 500 people throughout Hawaii were left homeless due to the hurricane. At the time, Hurricane Iwa was the costliest storm to hit the state, with damage totaling $312 million (1982 USD, $  USD). Three days after Hurricane Iwa passed the state, Governor George Ariyoshi declared the islands of Kauai and Niihau as disaster areas with President Ronald Reagan following suit on November 28, declaring Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu as disaster areas. Furthermore, two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights. Ten years following the storm, Hurricane Iniki struck the same area.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1982. No Eastern Pacific names were retired, so it was used again in the 1988 season. This is the same list used in the 1978 season, except for Fabio, which replaced Fico. A storm was named Fabio for the first time in 1982. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.\n\nFour names from the Central Pacific list were used – Akoni, Ema, Hana, and Iwa. This was the very first usage for all of these names. Akoni and Ema were used again in the 2019 season.\n\nWith four names being used, this season held the record for most named storms forming in the Central Pacific, until it was surpassed by the 2015 season.\n\nOne name was retired from the Central Pacific list after the 1982 season, Iwa. It was replaced with Io (which was later changed to Iona before its usage). Iwa is one of only four Central Pacific names to have been retired, the others being Iniki, Paka, and Ioke.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2188119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188119", "title": "Hungry generation", "text": "Hungry generation\n\nThe Hungry Generation () was a literary movement in the Bengali language launched by what is known today as the Hungryalist quartet, \"i.e.\" Binoy Mazumdar, Shakti Chattopadhyay, Saileswar Ghosh, Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury and Debi Roy (\"alias\" Haradhon Dhara), during the 1960s in Kolkata, India. Due to their involvement in this avant garde cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.\n\nThe approach of the Hungryalists was to confront and disturb the prospective readers' preconceived colonial canons. According to Pradip Choudhuri, a leading philosopher and poet of the generation, whose works have been extensively translated in French, their counter-discourse was the first voice of post-colonial freedom of pen and brush. Besides the famous four mentioned above, Utpal Kumar Basu, Binoy Majumdar, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Basudeb Dasgupta, Falguni Roy, Subhash Ghosh, Tridib Mitra, Alo Mitra, Ramananda Chattopadhyay, Anil Karanjai, Saileswar Ghosh, Karunanidhan Mukhopadhyay, and Subo Acharya were among the other leading writers and artists of the movement.\n\nThe origins of this movement stem from the educational establishments serving Chaucer and Spengler to the poor of India. The movement was officially launched, however, in November 1961 from the residence of Malay Roy Choudhury and his brother Samir Roychoudhury in Patna. They took the word \"Hungry\" from Geoffrey Chaucer's line \"In Sowre Hungry Tyme\" and they drew upon, among others, Oswald Spengler's histriographical ideas about the non-centrality of cultural evolution and progression, for philosophical inspiration. The movement was to last from 1961 to 1965. It is wrong to suggest that the movement was influenced by the Beat Generation, since Ginsberg did not visit Malay until April 1963, when he came to Patna. Poets Octavio Paz and Ernesto Cardenal were to visit Malay later during the 1960s. The hungry generation has some of the same ideals as The Papelipolas and the Barranquilla Group, both from Colombia, and the Spanish Generation of 68.\n\nThis movement is characterized by expression of closeness to nature and sometimes by tenets of Gandhianism and Proudhonianism. Although it originated at Patna, Bihar and was initially based in Kolkata, it had participants spread over North Bengal, Tripura and Benares. According to Dr. Shankar Bhattacharya, Dean at Assam University, as well as Aryanil Mukherjee, editor of Kaurab Literary Periodical, the movement influenced Allen Ginsberg as much as it influenced American poetry through the Beat poets who visited Calcutta, Patna and Benares during the 1960-1970s. Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, now a professor and editor, was associated with the Hungry generation movement. Shakti Chattopadhyay, Saileswar Ghosh, Subhas Ghosh left the movement in 1964.\n\nMore than 100 manifestos were issued during 1961-1965. Malay's poems have been published by Prof P. Lal from his Writers Workshop publication. Howard McCord published Malay Roy Choudhury's controversial poem \"Prachanda Boidyutik Chhutar\" i.e., Stark Electric Jesus from Washington State University in 1965. The poem has been translated into several languages of the world. Into German by Carl Weissner,in Spanish by Margaret Randall, in Urdu by Ameeq Hanfee, in Assamese by Manik Dass, in Gujarati by Nalin Patel, in Hindi by Rajkamal Chaudhary, and in English by Howard McCord.\n\nThe works of these participants appeared in Citylights Journal 1, 2 and 3 published between 1964 and 1966, edited by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and in special issues of American magazines including \"Kulchur\" edited by Lita Hornick, \"Klactoveedsedsteen\" edited by Carl Weissner, \"El Corno Emplunado\" edited by Margaret Randall, \" Evergreen Review\" edited by Barney Rosset, \"Salted Feathers\"edited by Dick Bakken, \"Intrepid\" edited by Alan De Loach, and \"San Francisco Earthquake\", during the 1960s. \"The Hungry Generation\", also known as \"Hungryalism\", challenged the mainstream literary genres. The group wrote poetry and prose in completely different forms and experimented with the contents. The movement changed the literary atmosphere of Bengal altogether. It had influences in Hindi, Marathi, Assamese and Urdu literatures.\n\nThere is a misconception that the Hungryalists and the Krittibas group were the same and that the Krittibas magazine was a Hungryalist platform. This is incorrect as the Krittibas was a group from the fifties. The Hungryalist movement was a sixties decade phenomenon. Krittibas magazine in its editorial had openly declared that they have no relations with the movement and that they do not approve of the philosophy of the movement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2188122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188122", "title": "Alfred Sarant", "text": "Alfred Sarant\n\nAlfred Epaminondas Sarant, also known as Filipp Georgievich Staros and Philip Georgievich Staros (September 26, 1918 – March 12, 1979), was an engineer and a member of the Communist party in New York City in 1944. He was part of the Rosenberg spy ring that reported to Soviet intelligence. Sarant worked on secret military radar at the United States Army Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Alexandre Feklisov, one of the KGB case officers who handled the Rosenberg spy apparatus described Sarant and Joel Barr as among the most productive members of the group. Sarant was recruited as a Soviet espionage agent by Barr.\n\nA member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) during the Second World War, Sarant worked at the nuclear physics laboratory of Cornell University. () In 1941, Julius Rosenberg and Joel Barr were recruited as Soviet spies by Jacob Golos. They in turn persuaded Sarant to join the network.\n\nAccording to Alexander Feklissov: \"Joel and Alfred were good friends and spent a lot of time together. I must admit that Sarant had the makings of an undercover agent; he was a cautious young man, yet full of resolve, with progressive ideas. Before we recruited him though, he had to pass a test. Barr asked Sarant to borrow some secret documents to which he had access because he, Barr, needed them for his personal use. Alfred did not hesitate in helping his friend and in the meantime the Center approved a bona fide approach.\" However, he was at first reluctant to become a spy but was eventually convinced to join the network by Barr. Sarant was given the code name Hughes.\n\nThe Venona project transcript of 14 November 1944 reported to Moscow that Sarant had been successfully recruited. The transcript noted Sarant and Barr were roommates and good friends and proposed to pair them off and get them to photograph their own materials. Initially Barr delivered film to Rosenberg, who passed it on to officers of the Soviet intelligence. Later, Barr met directly with KGB officers; Sarant did not have direct contact with the KGB in the U.S. One transcript reports Sarant and Barr delivered 17 authentic drawings relating to the AN/APQ-7, an advanced and secret airborne radar system developed jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Western Electric for the United States military.\n\nIn 1946 Sarant moved to Ithaca, New York, where he worked at Cornell University in the physics laboratories. Sarant's next door neighbor was Philip Morrison, a former Manhattan Project scientist and personal friend who joined the Communist Party of the United States in 1939. Sarant knew socially several prominent physicists, including Hans Bethe and Richard Feynman.\n\nTwo days after Julius Rosenberg's arrest on 17 July 1950, the FBI interviewed Sarant but did not arrest him, although it possessed decrypted MVD cables that clearly identified Sarant as a member of the Rosenberg ring. Three days later Sarant ran away with Carol Dayton, the wife of his close friend and neighbor, Bruce Dayton; Sarant and Dayton abandoned their children and spouses. The two crossed into Mexico and eluded the FBI.\n\nIn Mexico City, Sarant sought assistance from officials at an obscure Polish trade office, guessing correctly that they were intelligence officers. Following instructions from the KGB, the Poles hid Sarant and Dayton in Mexico, then engineered an escape that crossing the border to Guatemala on foot, taking a freighter to Casa Blanca, and flying to Poland via Spain. After six months in Warsaw they moved on to Moscow. The KGB arranged a dramatic reunion with Barr, who was summoned from Prague, where he had fled shortly after the Rosenberg ring started to unravel. Sarant was assigned a new identity, Philip Georgievich Staros, claiming a Canadian background to explain his accent. From Moscow, Barr and Sarant were resettled in Czechoslovakia and put to work as electrical engineers. They led a team that designed and built a prototype of the Soviet bloc's first automated anti-aircraft weapon. Their technology was quickly deployed and was in use, with some minor modifications, into the 1980s.\n\nIn 1956 Sarant and Barr moved to Leningrad where they were placed in charge of a military electronics research institute. They have been credited with being the founders of the Soviet microelectronics industry, in part because Sarant and Barr conceived of, designed and won political backing for the creation of Zelenograd, the Soviet Union's Silicon Valley. Sarant was the scientific director of Zelenograd until Nikita Khrushchev's forced retirement. In 1969 Sarant received a state honor for the UM-1, a computer that was widely used in Soviet industry. He led the team that created the Uzel, the first digital computer installed in a Soviet submarine. The Uzel was integrated into the Kilo-class submarines and as of 2007 was still in use in the Russian, Iranian, Chinese and Indian navies. In 1979 Sarant died of a heart attack. Carol Dayton, the woman who fled with him, returned to the United States in 1991.\n\nIt was not until 1983, thirty-three years after Sarant's flight to Mexico, that the full story of Sarant's life was told. A Russian émigré working at Harvard, Mark Kuchment, who had read \"The Rosenberg File\" linked Barr and Sarant to two prominent Soviet scientists, both native speakers of English.\n\nSarant's cover name in Soviet intelligence and in the Venona project is \"Hughes\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2188123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188123", "title": "Tun Tavern", "text": "Tun Tavern\n\nTun Tavern was a tavern and brewery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, which was a founding or early meeting place for a number of notable groups. It is traditionally regarded as the site where what became the United States Marine Corps held its first recruitment drive during the American Revolution. It is also regarded as one of the \"birthplaces of Masonic teachings in America\".\n\nThe tavern was erected in 1686 at the intersection of King (later called Water) Street and Tun Alley by settler Joshua Carpenter, brother of Samuel Carpenter, a Quaker merchant who made a fortune trading in Barbados. Joshua Carpenter built the Tun on the caraway that led to Carpenter's Wharf. Tun Tavern was named for the Old English word \"tun\", meaning a barrel or keg of beer. In the 1740s, a restaurant appellation, \"Peggy Mullan's Red Hot Beef Steak Club\" was added to the name of the tavern.\n\nTun Tavern hosted the first meetings of a number of organizations. In 1720, the first meetings of the St. George's Society (a charitable organization founded to assist needy Englishmen arriving in the new colony—predecessor of today's Sons of the Society of St. George) were held there. In 1732, the tavern hosted the first meetings of St. John's Lodge No. 1 of the Grand Lodge of the Masonic Temple. The Masonic Temple of Philadelphia recognizes Tun Tavern as the birthplace of Masonic teachings in America. In 1747, Tun Tavern became the founding place of the St. Andrew's Society, which like the St. George's Society, helped newly arrived Scottish.\n\nTun Tavern was a significant meeting place for other groups and individuals. In 1756, Benjamin Franklin used the inn as a recruitment gathering point for the Pennsylvania militia as it prepared to fight Native American uprisings. The tavern later hosted a meeting of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the Continental Congress. In October 1775 a seven man Naval Committee including John Adams appointed by Congress crafted articles of war to build America's first naval fleet.\n\nAccording to tradition, Tun Tavern was where the United States Marines held their first recruitment drive. On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress commissioned the innkeeper and former Quaker Samuel Nicholas to raise two battalions of Marines in Philadelphia. The tavern’s manager, Robert Mullan, was the \"chief Marine Recruiter\". Though legend places its first recruiting post at Tun Tavern, the historian Edwin Simmons surmises that it was more likely the Conestoga Waggon , a tavern owned by the Nicholas family. The first Continental Marine company was composed of one hundred Rhode Islanders commanded by Captain Nicholas. Each year on November 10, U.S. Marines worldwide toast the memory of this colonial inn as the officially-acknowledged birthplace of their service branch. The earliest Marines were deployed aboard Continental Congress Navy vessels as sharpshooters because they were typically recruited as outstanding marksmen.\n\nIn 1781, near the end of the American Revolution, Tun Tavern burned down. Its former structure stood at a location now occupied by Interstate 95, where it passes Penn's Landing. Tun Alley once existed between Walnut and Chestnut Streets east of Front Street. A commemorative marker on the east side of Front Street indicates the site, across from Sansom Walk.\n\nIn homage to the likely 1775 Tun Tavern menu, the U.S. Marine Corps National Museum located in Quantico, Virginia, contains a Tun Tavern-themed restaurant, whose lunch menu features beer and other fermented (alcoholic) beverages, peanut soup and bread pudding, the non-alcoholic recipe of which remains a traditional staple among some U.S. Marine food services to this day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2188129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188129", "title": "1981 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1981 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1981 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly below average Pacific hurricane season. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific basin and June 1 in the central Pacific basin. Both basins' seasons ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone of the season was designated on May 30, and the final storm of the season, Hurricane Otis, dissipated on October 30. The season produced fifteen named storms and a total of eight hurricanes, which was near normal. However, the total of one major hurricane was below the average of three.\n\nThe strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Norma, which was a powerful Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm caused six deaths – five in Texas, and one in Mexico, due to severe flooding. Additionally, the storm caused $74 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in damage, which is credited to significant crop damage and many tornadoes. However, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the season was Tropical Storm Lidia, which made two landfalls – one on the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula and the other along the shores of Sinaloa in early October. As the result of its heavy rainfall in northwestern Mexico, seventy-three fatalities were reported, along with $80 million in damage.\n\nThere was an absence in storm activity across the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, as no storms developed in the basin. However, two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific, Greg and Jova, entered the central Pacific, the latter entering as a hurricane. The season produced fifteen named storms and eight hurricanes; both of these numbers were equal to the average. The season's one major hurricane, a storm with winds of at least , was below the average of three. There are also at least two tropical depressions that did not strengthen into tropical storms.\nSix tropical cyclones made landfall in Mexico. First, Tropical Storm Adrian made landfall east-southeast of Acapulco, but did not cause any damage. Afterwards, Tropical Storm Irwin made landfall in Baja California Sur, but similarly to Adrian, did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Knut later made landfall near Mazatlan with winds equivalent to a minimal tropical storm, but no deaths or damage was reported. Tropical Storm Lidia struck about south of Los Mochis on October 8, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Heavy rainfall associated with the cyclone caused moderate damage in northwestern Mexico, and at least seventy-three deaths can be attributed to the storm. On May 30, an area of intense shower and thunderstorm activity located 270 mi (430 km) south of the Mexican coastline. The second to strike the area in 10 days, Norma was absorbed by a frontal system on October 14. The combined entity produced heavy rainfall and severe weather across Texas, which subsequently led to severe crop damage. The final storm to make landfall on Mexico during the 1981 season was Hurricane Otis. Intensifying into a hurricane by October 26, the hurricane brushed the coast of Jalisco before making landfall near Mazatlan at hurricane intensity on October 30. Otis was the second of two hurricanes to make landfall in the country this season.\n\nOn May 30, an area of intense shower and thunderstorm activity located to the south of the Mexican coastline intensified into a tropical depression. Drifting towards the north and then east-northeast around an area of high pressure centered off the southern coast of Mexico, the depression began to strengthen over water. Twelve hours after formation, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Adrian. Reaching a peak intensity of 45 mph (75 km/h), Adrian began to move over slightly cooler ocean temperatures of and subsequently began to weaken. After being downgraded to a tropical depression by June 2, data from two cargo ships, the \"Androemda\" and \"Santa Maria\", were helpful in locating Adrian's center of circulation as it moved towards the Mexican coastline. On June 4, the system made landfall east-southeast of Acapulco; however, no damage associated with the tropical cyclone was reported, and Adrian dissipated later that same day.\n\nOn June 28, the season's second tropical depression formed approximately east of Clipperton Island. Moving quickly towards the west over warm sea-surface temperatures, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beatriz just twelve hours after formation. Embedded within an area of favorable atmospheric conditions, Beatriz attained hurricane status at 1800 UTC on June 30, and intensified further to attain its first brief peak at by early on June 1. Fluctuating in intensity, Hurricane Beatriz attained its peak intensity for a second time on June  2, only to enter an area of higher wind shear and cooler sea-surface temperatures. Far away from land, Beatriz was downgraded to a tropical storm on June 3, and then further into a tropical depression the following day. The tropical cyclone dissipated on July 4 while located several hundred miles to the west of Baja California Sur.\n\nSince Beatriz briefly posed a threat to Mexico and California, the Hurricane Hunters were put on standby, but no flights were made into the storm. The system did produce wave heights as high as to Southern California; however, impact from the storm was less than anticipated.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather located several hundred miles to the south of Acapulco organized into a tropical depression on July 4. Moving towards the west-northwest over warm sea-surface temperatures, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on July 5, receiving the name \"Calvin\". Reaching a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) later that day, Calvin began to move north-northwest around the western periphery of a high pressure system located over extreme northern Mexico. Calvin then moved over cooler water and subsequently weakened to a minimal tropical storm. Located 98 mi (158 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 8, Calvin further weakened to a tropical depression and turned to the west. The system dissipated the following day. As a dying system, Calvin produced high clouds over California and Arizona.\n\nBased on satellite imagery and data from a nearby ship, \"Yamazuru\", a tropical depression formed far away from land on July 10. Passing north of Clipperton Island, the depression began to strengthen under favorable atmospheric conditions, and was designated Tropical Storm \"Dora\" twelve hours after formation. Moving towards the west-northwest, Dora attained hurricane status on July 13; subsequently, the ship \"Amestelmolen\" reported seas of , a minimum barometric pressure of , and winds as it passed north of the storm's center. As Dora reached its peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km/h) on June 14, a well-defined eye became apparent on satellite imagery, and the storm turned more towards the west. Cooler ocean temperatures below 74 °F (23 °C) subsequently caused the hurricane to weaken, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 15. The storm's structure further deteriorated the following day, and Dora dissipated over southwest of Cabo San Lucas, without affecting land.\n\nFollowing Dora's dissipation, a new tropical depression formed west of the Mexican coastline. While retaining its intensity, the depression moved west-northwest before bending towards the southwest as it intensified into Tropical Storm Eugene on July 18. Above exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures of , Eugene slowly intensified. After passing south of Socorro Island, the storm accelerated west-northwest, reaching a peak intensity of early on June 19. Shortly thereafter, the system began to meander over cooler ocean temperatures, and weakened to a tropical depression on July 20. After changing little in intensity for nearly 24 hours, Eugene dissipated on July 21 while located west of the Baja California Peninsula, over water temperatures of . There were no reports of any effects attributed to the storm.\n\nFernanda originated from an area of showers and thunderstorms that gained sufficient organization to be designated a tropical depression on August 6. Moving rapidly towards the west, the system passed north of Clipperton Island. Above warm ocean temperatures, the depression strengthened to become a tropical storm twenty-one hours after formation, and after briefly turning towards the west-northwest, Fernanda attained hurricane status on August 9. A well-defined eye associated with the hurricane became visible, and the system reached its peak intensity as a 105 mph (165 km/h) Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on August 10. Turning towards the northwest, Fernanda began to enter an area of cooler ocean temperatures and higher wind shear, subsequently weakening. On August 11, Fernanda was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, and then further to a tropical storm later that evening. By midday the following day, Fernanda had become a tropical depression, and dissipated early on August 13 without any effects on land.\n\nAn area of intense thunderstorm activity left the southern coast of Mexico in mid-August. About south of Socorro Island, it formed on August 13. Over warm sea surface temperatures, the depression steadily intensified; it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Greg at 1800 UTC. As the storm was moving on the southwest periphery of an area of high pressure, it curved west-northwest. Meanwhile, the storm passed south of Clarion Island at 2100 UTC on August 14. After turning toward the west, the storm's motion slowed. After maintaining its intensity while still a minimal tropical storm, Greg turned to the west-southwest for a day, only to resume its westerly course. As its speed increased a little, Greg gradually strengthened. Based on data from the ship \"Chapa\", Greg was upgraded into a hurricane early on August 20. However, increased wind shear caused the storm to rapidly weaken back into a tropical storm. At this time, the tropical storm was located over water. Shortly thereafter, Greg moved into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC)'s area of responsibility. It continued to weaken, and was only a minimal tropical storm by the afternoon of August 21. Although Greg weakened into a depression, it maintained a well-defined center of circulation for an additional 24 hours until dissipating at 1800 UTC on August 22 over east-northeast of Hawaii.\n\nBased on a report from a cargo ship, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center upgraded a tropical disturbance into a tropical depression roughly west of the Mexican coast at 2105 UTC on August 21. Four hours later, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Hilary. After turning towards the west, it passed about south of Socorro Island. Even though Hilary developed a well-defined eye late on August 23, the cyclone was not upgraded into a hurricane until the next afternoon. Accelerating, Hilary reached its peak strength of 85 mph (140 km/h) while located west of Cabo San Lucas. Moving west, Hilary began to weaken over water. Late on August 28, nearly 24 hours following Hilary's downgrade into a tropical depression, the tropical cyclone dissipated far from land.\n\nA tropical depression formed west of Acapulco on August 27. Over water, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irwin the next day. By August 25, Tropical Storm Irwin had peaked in intensity as a moderate tropical storm, then weakened as it moved over sea-surface temperatures. Less than southeast of Baja California, Irwin was downgraded into a depression. Turning west-northwest, Irwin made landfall about south of La Paz on August 30. After moving offshore the next day, Irwin dissipated. No damage was reported.\n\nFollowing two weeks of inactivity, a tropical depression formed at 1200 UTC September 14 while located in the middle of the Eastern Pacific. Above very warm ocean temperatures, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Jova six hours later. Jova rapidly intensified, and developed an eye late on September 15. Early on September 17, Jova peaked as a mid-level Category 1 hurricane. After briefly turning to the west-southwest, Jova turned back towards the west while weakened into a tropical storm. On September 19, the cyclone turned west-northwest, and dissipated about north of Hawaii on September 21. Due to its track just north of Hawaii and rapidly weakening in the Central Pacific, its only effect on the Hawaiian Islands was to disrupt the trade winds, leading to an increase in humidity.\n\nWhile Jova was weakening, a tropical disturbance formed within the Mexican coast. Moving west-northwest, a tropical depression formed on September 19, and became a tropical storm six hours later. Above sea surface temperatures, Knut continued to intensify. After turning north, Tropical Storm Knut reached its peak strength of 65 mph (120 km/h). Between a high-pressure area and a weak upper-level trough, Knut turned sharply to the east. After passing south of the Baja California Peninsula, the tropical storm weakened over cooler water. Knut dissipated as it made landfall in Mexico, at 1330 UTC on September 21. No damage was reported.\nA tropical depression formed on October 6 ahead of a front; the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lidia on October 7. Lidia moved generally north, and reached its peak wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h). Despite encountering warm ocean temperatures, Lidia slowly weakened as it moved towards southern Baja California Peninsula. The tropical cyclone passed over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula on 1700 UTC October 7; at the time of the landfall Lidia was located about northwest of Cabo San Lucas. Two hours later, Lidia entered the Gulf of California, and turned to the northeast. Lidia made landfall on the shores of Sinaloa just south of Los Mochis on October 8, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The remnants of Lidia continued their northeast track, ultimately emerging into the Southern United States, bringing moisture to extreme southeastern Arizona.\n\nHeavy rain caused flooding that cut off seven towns in Sinaloa from the outside world. It also contaminated the water supply in Culiacán, leaving many without clean drinking water. Almost a hundred villages and two dams were flooded, The Rio Fuerte burst its banks and flooded sixty settlements. These rains sent water down a dry river bed, killing 40 people, mostly children. In one village, six soldiers died. In the northern part of Sinaloa, 42 were confirmed killed and 76 were missing. Around Los Mochis, four people were killed, where 800 houses were destroyed. In Culiacán, eleven people were killed. The total death toll from Tropical Storm Lidia was determined to exceed 73, which mostly occurred in rural areas. Losses to cattle, crops, and fishing vessels were more than $80 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Due to the damage wrought by both Lidia and Norma, the Governor of Sinaloa, declared his state a disaster area.\n\nOn October 7, a tropical depression developed several hundred miles to the south of the Mexican coastline. Under favorable environmental conditions, the depression began to organize, and became a tropical storm twelve hours after formation, receiving the name Max. Moving north-northwestward, Max reached a peak intensity of briefly on October 9 before the system began to move into an area with cooler ocean temperatures and stronger wind shear. Early on October 10, Max weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated during the afternoon hours of the same day without any effects to land.\nEarly on October 8, a tropical depression had developed far from land. Moving northwest, the storm intensified into Tropical Storm Norma at 0600 UTC. On 1800 UTC October 9, the EPHC upgraded the storm into a hurricane. Subsequently, Norma began to undergo a period rapid intensification; the storm soon reached major hurricane status. The storm reached its peak of 125 mph (205 km/h) at 1800 UTC on October 10. The storm began to accelerate while weakening. After briefly re-intensifying late on October 1, Hurricane Norma made landfall just northeast of Mazatlan with winds of 105 mph (155 km/h) at 1000 UTC on October 12. Although the storm quickly dissipated over land, a second area of low pressure formed over western Texas early on October 13 before the system itself was absorbed by a frontal system on October 14.\n\nPrior to landfall 5,000 people evacuated, thus only one deaths was reported (a fisherman drowned when his boat capsized in the storm). However, the hurricane caused more devastation in the flood-ravaged region. Agriculture was disrupted, and cattle were killed, causing at least $24 million (1981 USD) in crop damage. Torrential rains caused serious flooding north of Mazatlan. Five thousand two hundred residents need to be evacuated from low-lying areas. The remnants of the storm moved into Texas and Oklahoma. The heavy rainfall caused two rivers to reach flood-stage. A total of five people were killed in the United states, three of these deaths occurred in Fort Worth. During October 13 and 14, a total of 13 tornadoes were reported in northern Texas and southern Oklahoma, including a F2 tornado in McLennan that injured four people and caused $25 million in damage. In Oklahoma, 60 bridges were washed away due to flooding. Total damage in Texas was estimated at $50 million (1981 USD).\n\nOn October 24, the season's last tropical cyclone developed to the south of the Mexican coastline. Moving towards the west-northwest, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name \"Otis\". Turning towards the north and eventually northeast, Otis steadily strengthened, and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane early on October 26. Sharply bending back towards the west-northwest, and eventually the north, Otis reached a peak intensity of before higher wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures began to impede on the system's organization. On October 29, Otis skirted the coast of Jalisco as a minimal Category 1 hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm. The next day, Otis made landfall near Mazatlan before being absorbed by a frontal system.\nPer the Japan Meteorological Agency, Typhoon Freda briefly existed in the basin as a dissipating tropical storm before being absorbed by another extratropical low on March 17, but the system isn't recognized by neither NHC nor CPHC.\n\nOn August 4, a tropical depression developed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Despite being over warm sea surface temperatures, the depression dissipated the following day as wind shear began to significantly increase. Thus, the depression was never named, and never had any effects on land. Two weeks later, a tropical disturbance developed south-southeast of Socorro Island drifted north-northwest of a couple of days before organizing into a tropical depression a short distance southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Despite being located over warm sea surface temperatures, it failed to intensify. Tropical Depression Nine-E moved westward for 12 hours prior to dissipation.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1981. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. This was the first time most of these names were used since the modern lists began, except for Fernanda, Hilary, and Norma which were previously used in the old four-year lists. No names were retired, so this list was used again in the 1987 season.\n\nIn addition, 1981 was the first season in which the modern set of central Pacific hurricane naming lists was in effect, though no storms were named during the season.\n\n"}

It is in Ambassel, South Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region, northwest of Dessie, at a latitude and a longitude of . Part of Ambassel woreda, Amba Geshen is one of the mountains of Ethiopia where most of the male heirs to the Emperor of Ethiopia were interned, usually for life. It was the second of the three such mountains, or \"amba\", said to have been used for this purpose, the other two being Debre Damo and Wehni.\n\nFrom some undetermined time, it was the practice that when the Ethiopian emperor assumed the throne, his brothers and other male relatives would be taken to a royal prison, where they would henceforth live until either they were called forth to become the new emperor or they died. Some traditions state this began during the Zagwe dynasty, others even earlier; the first certain mention of the practice was during the reign of Jin Asgad, who confined his brothers and his own sons to Amba Geshen.\n\nThe use Amba Geshen as a prison was ended by Emperor Na'od, but Manoel de Almeida mentions that \"those who were there before\" were guarded until the reign of Emperor Gelawdewos, when only the descendants of Emperor Takla Maryam continued to be kept under watch because of their treachery against Emperor Baeda Maryam I.\n\nBecause it was a natural fortress, the Emperors also kept the imperial treasury there even after it was no longer a royal prison. The Muslims, under Ahmed Gragn, made several attempts to capture Amba Geshen: the \"Futuh al-Habasha\" describes the first (in November 1531) and second (in 1533); his final attempt in 1540 was successful, and he put the entire garrison and inhabitants to death. Thomas Pakenham notes that contemporary Ethiopians believe that the True Cross was buried atop Amba Geshen by St Helena of Constantinople.\n\nAlthough the first European to mention Amba Geshen was Francisco Álvares, who witnessed an escaped prince being returned to Amba Geshen, the earliest European to accurately describe Amba Geshen was Almeida, who states it is\n\nAlmeidez further writes that on top there was a natural pool and spring for water, and covered by \"kosso\" and \"zegba\" brush and wild cedars. He mentions two churches: Egzyabeher Ab, built by Emperor Lalibela, and Tekle Maryam, begun by Emperor Na'od but completed by his son, Lebna Dengel, which survived Ahmed Gragn's ravages. However, when Pakenham visited Amba Geshen in 1955, he found that both churches had been rebuilt with tin roofs.\n\nAnother inaccurate account of Amba Geshen, called Mount Amara, was published in \"Purchas, His Pilgrimage\", which was believed by Pakenham to have inspired John Milton's description of Paradise in \"Paradise Lost\", and later Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \"Kubla Khan\".\n\nIn Samuel Johnson's \"Rasselas\", the main character is a prince of Ethiopia who is interned in a mountain sanctuary called the \"Happy Valley\". To explore the world and find his own happiness, he escapes. Johnson's account was based on the travel account of Jerónimo Lobo.\n"}

In 1876 her paintings were selected for inclusion at the Salon's juried exhibition, when Manet's work was not.\n\nBorn in Paris to a family of artisans (her father was a patinator of bronzes, while her mother was a milliner), Meurent started modeling at the age of sixteen in the studio of Thomas Couture and may also have studied art at his women's atelier. Meurent first modeled for Manet in 1862, for his painting \"The Street Singer\". Manet was first drawn to Meurent when he saw her in the street, carrying her guitar. She was particularly noticeable for her petite stature, which earned her the nickname \"La Crevette (The Shrimp)\", and for her red hair, which is depicted as very bright in Manet's watercolor copy of \"Olympia\". As well as playing the guitar, Meurent also played the violin, gave lessons in the two instruments, and sang in café-concerts. \n\nMeurent's name remains forever associated with Manet's masterpieces of 1863, \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" and \"Olympia\", which include nude portrayals of her. At that time she also modeled for Edgar Degas and the Belgian painter Alfred Stevens, both close friends of Manet. Her relationship with Stevens is said to have been particularly close.\n\nManet continued to use Meurent as a model until the early 1870s, when she began taking art classes and they became estranged, as she was drawn to the more academic style of painting that Manet opposed. The last Manet painting in which Meurent appears is \"Gare Saint-Lazare\" (not to be confused with Monet's painting of the same name), painted in 1873, which is often referred to as \"The Railway\". The painting is considered the best example of Manet's use of contemporary subject matter.\nIn 1875, Meurent began studying with the portraitist . The following year, Meurent first submitted work of her own at the Salon and was accepted. Manet's own submissions were rejected by the jury that year. \"Bourgeoise de Nuremberg au XVIe siècle\", Meurent's entry at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1879, was hung in the same room as the entry by Manet. Work by Meurent also was included in the 1885 and 1904 exhibitions. In all, Meurent exhibited in the Salon six times. She also continued to support herself by modelling through the 1880s for Norbert Goeneutte, an artist best known for his etchings, and for Toulouse-Lautrec, who took to introducing her as \"Olympia\".\n\nMeurent was inducted into the Société des Artistes Français in 1903, with the support of Charles Hermann-Leon and Tony Robert-Fleury, the Société's founder. By 1906 Meurent had left Paris for the suburb of Colombes, where she lived with a woman named Marie Dufour for the remainder of her life. The two appear to have shared ownership of their house. In her eighties she continued to refer to herself as an artist, as recorded in a census from that time. \n\nMeurent died on March 17, 1927. \n\nAfter the death of Dufour in 1930, the contents of the house were liquidated; in the late twentieth century, elderly neighbours recalled the last contents of the house, including a violin and its case, being burnt on a bonfire.\n\nA painting by Meurent, \"Le Jour des Rameaux\" or \"Palm Sunday\" was recovered in 2004 and now hangs in the Colombes History Museum.\n\nVictorine Meurent's life has inspired two historical novels, and she appears as a character in several others.\n\nThe Irish writer George Moore included Meurent as a character in his semi-fictional autobiography, \"Memoirs of My Dead Life\" (1906). She appears as a middle-aged woman, living in a lesbian relationship with a famous courtesan.\n\nMeurent is the protagonist of both \"Mademoiselle Victorine: a Novel\" (2007) by Debra Finerman and \"A Woman With No Clothes On\" (2008) by V R Main and is a character in Christopher Moore's novel \"Sacré Bleu\" (2012).\n\nShe is also a character in the film \"Intimate Lives: The Women of Manet\", aka \"Manet in Love\" (1998) and is played by Shelley Phillips.\n\nAnother novel depicting Meurent and her relationship with Manet is \"Paris Red\" by Maureen Gibbon (2015).\n\n\n"}

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern and central Pacific Ocean. This season was relatively uneventful; since no tropical cyclones made landfall, there were no reports of casualties or damage.\n\nOverall, the 1980 season was slightly below the long-term average, with 16 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 15 were named, 7 reached hurricane intensity, and only 3 became major hurricanes by attaining category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. All eastern Pacific systems this year formed in the eastern Pacific proper and two storms crossed into the central Pacific: Carmen from the west and Kay from the east. The season had an early start when Carmen crossed over the International Dateline in April. The strongest storm of this season is Hurricane Kay, peaking at . Kay lasted for fourteen and a half days, which was the fifth-longest lasting Pacific hurricane at the time.\n\nThe 1980 Pacific hurricane season began on April 5, 1980, with the crossing of the dateline by Tropical Storm Carmen and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Newton on October 29. Of the sixteen tropical cyclones that in the eastern north Pacific Ocean during 1980, one was a tropical depression, eight were tropical storms, and seven were hurricanes, of which three were major hurricanes of Category or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Of these systems, all except one tropical storm formed east of 140°W in the eastern Pacific proper. These totals are below the long term average of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. Two tropical cyclones existed in the central Pacific, both of which crossed in from other tropical cyclone basins. This total is below the average of four or five tropical cyclones per year.\n\nOn April 4, a tropical depression formed just east of the International Date Line. At the time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated it tropical depression 02W. As it moved generally northwestwards, it strengthened into a tropical storm just before crossing the dateline, but only received a name in the northwest Pacific, being designated Carmen. After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on April 6. Carmen recurved northeast and crossed the International Date Line, entering the central Pacific on April 7. The JTWC subsequently relinquished responsibility to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Carmen lost its initial motion and stalled in the area, ultimately weakening in to a tropical depression on April 8. The depression dissipated the following day and the remnant low returned to western Pacific.\n\nTropical Storm Carmen caused no deaths or damages in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. It is the only known tropical cyclone in the central Pacific to exist in the month of April. In addition, it was the first northern hemisphere tropical cyclone to cross the dateline from west to east since Tropical Storm Virginia in 1968.\n\nAgatha originated from a tropical depression that formed south-southwest of Acapulco on June 9. After becoming better organized, EPHC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm later that day, giving it the name Agatha. The storm turned north then northwest and strengthened into a hurricane. On June 12, Agatha reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. After entering an area with cooler sea surface temperature and stable air, Agatha steadily weakened into a tropical storm on June 13 and a tropical depression on June 14. The EPHC issued the last advisory on Agatha on the following day as Agatha rapidly dissipated.\n\nA disturbance south-southwest of Acapulco developed a circulation and was designated Tropical Storm Blas, skipping the depression stage. Blas headed northwest, and intensified, peaking in windspeed on June 16. The cyclone then steadily weakened, and dissipated on June 19, twelve hours after weakening into a tropical depression.\n\nA disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on June 17. It moved northwest and then west, and never strengthened much. The tropical cyclone dissipated on June 19 after moving over cooler waters. It caused no known impact.\n\nA tropical disturbance moving west-northwestward organized into a tropical depression on June 25. It quickly became a tropical storm. Celia intensified into a hurricane on June 26 and peaked in intensity from June 26 to June 28. Celia then curved to the northwest as it wheeled around the edge of a ridge. Celia weakened into a tropical storm on June 28, a depression on June 29, and dissipated just after that. It remnants remained, and cloudiness and moisture associated with the cyclone were carried into the Continental United States by an upper-level trough.\n\nCelia\"s remnants and moisture brought rain to Santa Barbara County, California, on the last two days of June. Other than that, Celia caused no impact.\n\nOn July 1, a westward-moving tropical disturbance located to the southwest of Acapulco organized into a tropical depression. The next day, it intensified into a tropical storm as it briefly jogged to the north. Darby peaked in wind speed just after that. It then weakened into a depression on July 3 and dissipated later that day. Darby did not affect land, hence causing neither casualties or damage.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather developed gale-force winds and a cyclonic circulation, and was upgraded directly to tropical storm status on July 12. Estelle's winds peaked in velocity just after that. The cyclone then steadily weakened as it curved to the west northwest. Estelle dissipated on July 13. Estelle did not affect land. No damage or casualties were attributed to this tropical cyclone.\n\nA tropical disturbance northeast of Clipperton organized into a tropical depression on July 18. Heading northwestwards, it intensified into a tropical storm on July 20. Frank reached its maximum wind speed shortly after that. The cyclone then turned to the west and gradually weakened, dissipating on July 22. No reports of damage or casualties were attributed to Tropical Storm Frank.\n\nA tropical disturbance formed southwest of Acapulco on July 26. The disturbance was then upgraded to a tropical depression on July 28. The cyclone headed northwest. It intensified into a tropical storm on July 29. That same day, Georgette was briefly a hurricane. The cyclone turned to the west and weakened, dissipating on July 31. Georgette did not affect land. Consequently, it caused no known impact.\n\nA tropical disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on July 31. It headed west, and then gradually curved to the northwest as it paralleled the coast of Mexico. The cyclone became a storm shortly after forming, a hurricane on August 2, and peaked in windspeed on August 4. It then steadily weakened after that, and dissipated over cool waters shortly after becoming a tropical depression on August 7. Howard threatened the coasts of Southern California and the northern part of the Baja California Peninsula, but in the end never approached land. Hence, Howard caused no impact.\n\nA tropical disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on August 5 and a tropical storm the next day. Isis headed generally west northwest and peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on August 8. Isis then weakened, becoming a tropical storm on August 10, turning to the west, and dissipating the next day. Isis never affected land, and for that reason it was responsible for no casualties or damage.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec became a tropical depression on August 22 and a storm the next day. Javier became a hurricane on August 24, and peaked as a major hurricane on August 25. Javier then weakened, becoming a tropical storm on August 27 and a storm the next day. It dissipated on August 29, having moved west-northwest for almost its entire life. Hurricane Javier had no impact on land. Consequently, no one was killed and nothing was damaged by this hurricane.\n\nA tropical disturbance south of Acapulco developed into a tropical depression on September 16 and a tropical storm later that day. Kay headed in an irregular but generally west-northwest path out to sea. Kay strengthened into a hurricane on September 17. It continued strengthening and reached its peak as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on September 18. Kay then slowly weakened, and was a tropical storm by September 20. Kay's forward motion slowed as it neared the central Pacific. It restrengthened into a hurricane on September 23, and crossed 140°W and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility the next day. Kay executed a small anticyclonic loop, and then began weakening again. It became a tropical storm again on September 27, and a depression two days later. The cyclone dissipated on September 30 while located north of the Hawaiian Islands. Kay had no effect on land, causing no damage or casualties. It was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season at . Kay lasted for 14.5 days, enough to make it the fifth-longest lasting Pacific hurricane at the time.\n\nA westward-moving disturbance south of Acapulco strengthened into a tropical depression on September 21. Continuing on its path, it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester on September 23. Lester's motion then slowed down, and it spun about in the open ocean until it dissipated on September 25, having never affected land.\n\nA disturbance east of Clipperton became a tropical depression and then a tropical storm. It headed northwest and weakened into a depression on October 12. It dissipated shortly after that. Because Tropical Storm Madeline did not come near land, it caused no known damages or casualties.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather southeast of Socorro Island became a tropical storm on October 28. It headed northeast and approached the coast of Mexico. However, an area of high wind shear and cool waters destroyed the cyclone on October 29, before it could reach the coast. Newton was the tropical cyclone that came closest to making landfall this season. No impact was reported.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1980. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1986 season. This was the first time most of these names were used since the modern lists began, except for Agatha, Estelle, Georgette and Madeline, which were previously used in the old four-year lists.\nIn contrast to previous years, where tropical cyclones forming in the central Pacific received names from the western Pacific naming lists, a separate set of five central Pacific hurricane naming lists were created for the 1980 season. The list used for the 1980 season was intended to be reused for the 1985 season. However, as no storms formed in the central Pacific in 1980, these five naming lists were scrapped and replaced with the modern set of central Pacific naming lists for the following season. The first name to be used on the modern lists was Akoni in the 1982 season.\n\n\n"}

It produces three hundred performances of twenty-five German language productions during an annual season which runs from September through June.\n\nIt was built in 1898 as the \"Kaiserjubiläum-Stadttheater\" (Kaiser's Jubilee Civic Theatre), originally producing only plays. Because of the very brief construction period (10 months) the first director Adam Müller-Gutenbrunn had to start with debts of 160,000 gulden. After this inauspicious startup the \"Kaiserjubiläum-Stadttheater\" had to declare bankruptcy five years later in 1903.\n\nOn 1 September 1903 Rainer Simons took over the house and renamed it the \"Kaiserjubiläum-Stadttheater - Volksoper\" (public opera). His intention was to continue the production of plays but also establish series of opera and operetta. The first Viennese performances of \"Tosca\" and \"Salome\" were given at the Volksoper in 1907 and 1910 respectively. World-famous singers such as Maria Jeritza, Leo Slezak and Richard Tauber appeared there; the conductor Alexander Zemlinsky became the first bandmaster in 1906.\n\nIn the years up to and through the First World War the Volksoper attained a position as Vienna's second prestige opera house. In 1919, Felix Weingartner became Artistic Director and Principal Conductor. He was followed as Director by Hugo Gruder-Guntram. After 1929, it focused on light opera, and under Gruder-Guntram undertook a number of summer tours to Abbazia in 1935, Cairo and Alexandria in 1937 and throughout Italy in 1938, with guest appearances from Richard Tauber. After the Second World War, the Vienna Volksoper became the alternative venue to the devastated Vienna State Opera. In 1955 the Volksoper returned to its former role of presenting opera, operetta, and musicals.\n\nFrom September 1991 to June 1996 the Vienna Volksoper was under a collective leadership with the Vienna State Opera. In 1999 the Volksoper became a 100% subsidiary of the Bundestheater-Holding.\nSince 1 September 2007 Robert Meyer has headed the Volksoper as artistic director together with the business manager Christoph Ladstätter.\nEach season includes about 25 productions, a total of approximately 300 performances—a performance almost every day. In addition to opera, operetta, musicals and ballet, there are special performances and children's programs.\n\nOn three different levels there are 1261 seats and 72 standing room places as well as two places for wheelchairs.\n\nThe orchestra pit is equipped with two electrically driven stage lifts, with a loading capacity of 500 kg/m. It is adjustable in height from 0 to 2.65 meters below stage level.\n\nThe red velvet house curtain is hydraulically drawn and liftable. The gather velocity is 0.15 to 3.0 m/s, the lift velocity can be up to 2.0 m/s.\n\nThe stage is 17.2 meters wide and 19 meters deep and has a mechanic load capacity of 500 kg/m. In the middle of the stage is a turnable and liftable circular platform, around which is a turnable ring platform with an external diameter of 15 meters. There are also 3 hand-operated person trap mechanisms.\n\nSince 1999 the Volksoper Vienna is a 100% subsidiary of the Bundestheater Holding AG (Federal theater holding AG) along with the Vienna State Opera and the Burgtheater (en: (Imperial) Court Theatre). The Bundestheater Holding AG is owned by the Republic of Austria.\nThe Holding also holds 51.1% of the Theaterservice Gmbh, which offers services in design and administrational matters. The remaining 48.9% are shared equally among the three theater houses (16.3% each).\n\nIn 1987, the opera house was used for a scene set in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia (now part of Slovakia), for the James Bond film \"The Living Daylights\", where Timothy Dalton made his debut as Bond near the very beginning of the film, where he first spotted the key female character Kara Milovy (played by Maryam d'Abo). \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188206", "title": "Campaign advertising", "text": "Campaign advertising\n\nIn politics, campaign advertising is the use of an advertising campaign through the media to influence a political debate, and ultimately, voters. These ads are designed by political consultants and political campaign staff. Many countries restrict the use of broadcast media to broadcast political messaging. In the European Union, many countries do not permit paid-for TV or radio advertising for fear that wealthy groups will gain control of airtime, making fair play impossible and distorting the political debate in the process.\n\nIn both the United Kingdom and Ireland, paid advertisements are forbidden, though political parties are allowed a small number of party political broadcasts in the run up to election time. The United States has a very free market for broadcast political messaging. Canada allows paid-for political broadcasts but requires equitable access to the airwaves.\n\nCampaigns can include several different media (depending on local law). The time span over which political campaign advertising is possible varies greatly from country to country, with campaigns in the United States lasting a year or more to places like the UK and Ireland where advertising is restricted by law to just a short period of weeks before the election. Social media has become very important in political messaging, making it possible to message larger groups of constituents with very little physical effort or expense, but the totality of messaging through these channels is often out of the hands of campaign managers.\n\nPolitical advertising has changed drastically over the last several decades. In his campaign for the 1948 United States presidential election, Harry S. Truman was proud of his accomplishment of shaking approximately 500,000 hands and covering 31,000 miles of ground across the nation. But that accomplishment was soon to pale in comparison when in 1952, the 1952 United States presidential election saw a major change in how candidates reached their potential audiences. With the advent of television, war hero and presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower, created forty twenty-second television spot commercials entitled, \"Eisenhower Answers America\" where he answered questions from \"ordinary\" citizens in an attempt to appear accessible to \"the common man\". These questions were filmed in one day using visitors to Radio City Music Hall, who were filmed gazing up at Eisenhower as he answered questions about the Korean War, government corruption, and the state of the economy. He did not have to shake a half a million hands or travel the country extensively. He won the trust of the American people with his direct approach and subsequently the Presidential election. His vice president was Richard M. Nixon.\n\nIn the 1960 United States presidential election, Vice President Nixon used a formal television address in his presidential campaign, designed to answer questions about The Cold War and government corruption, and to show Americans that he was the stronger, more experienced candidate. On the other side of the fence, Catholic born John F. Kennedy created approximately 200 commercials during his campaign, but there were two that made Nixon’s efforts futile. The first was a thirty-minute commercial created from a speech he delivered in Houston, where he called for religious tolerance in response to criticism that Catholicism was incompatible with a run for the Oval Office. The second and more memorable was the first Kennedy-Nixon debate. In the first of four televised debates, Kennedy appeared tanned and confident in opposition to Nixon, who looked pale and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Seventy-five million viewers watched the debates, and although Nixon was initially thought to be the natural successor to Eisenhower, the election results proved otherwise, and Kennedy was ultimately declared the winner.\n\nIn the 1964 United States presidential election, aggressive advertising paved the way for a landslide victory for Lyndon B. Johnson. One of the first negative and maybe the most controversial commercial, perhaps of all time, was an advertisement dubbed \"The Daisy Girl.\" The commercial showed a young girl picking the petals off a daisy. After she finishes counting, a voice off camera begins a countdown to a nuclear explosion. The ad ends with an appeal to vote Johnson, \"because the stakes are too high for you to stay home.\" The commercial used fear and guilt, an effective advertising principle, to make people take action to protect the next generation. The ad ran for under a minute and only aired once, but due to the right wing, pro-war views of Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate, it resulted in a 44 to 6 state victory for Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nOver the next decade, the United States saw the rise of the televised political attack ad. Richard M. Nixon was especially proficient at this form of advertising, and his commercials proved to be very successful in his reelection campaign during the 1972 United States presidential election, where he won handily with a 49 to 1 state victory. George McGovern ran a campaign free of political attack ads until the very end of his campaign, when he tried to attack Nixon after he realized he was dipping lower in the polls. His attempt proved to be too late, but his neutral style of attack ads against Nixon, featuring white text scrolling across a black background, became what is now seen as a fairly common method used in political and product advertising.\n\nAttack ads continued to become the norm in political advertising. Ronald Reagan used them against Jimmy Carter during the 1980 United States presidential election. It was also the first time that a family member was also used to attack the opposing candidate. One particular advertisement showed Nancy Reagan (Reagan’s wife) accusing Carter of a weak foreign policy. This campaign also saw the rise of campaign finance issues when Reagan used political action committees to solicit funds on his behalf. However, in Reagan's reelection bid during the 1984 United States presidential election, the United States experienced the beginning of a different form of political advertising; one with a much more positive flow and a stronger, more powerful message. With the country in a relatively prosperous state, advertisements in support of Reagan evoked an emotional bond between the country and its president. Visions of Americans going about their daily lives with relative ease were compiled to convince America that voting against Reagan was a vote against prosperity. The positive and emotionally provocative ads proved more successful than negative attack ads. He was so highly successful that he won against Walter Mondale with a 49 to 1 state victory.\n\nIn the 1988 United States presidential election, attack ads returned with a renewed vigor. George H.W. Bush used campaign ads that ridiculed his opponent Michael Dukakis, making him appear soft on crime. He contrasted these negative ads, with the emotional style commercial used by Ronald Reagan, to capitalize on his connection to the former president. Again borrowing from Reagan's campaign practices he used free publicity as often as possible, making sure he was photographed in various situations that were likely to be aired in the evening news. Although Michael Dukakis tried to discredit the Bush campaign in many ways, he was ultimately unsuccessful, losing to the former Vice President by thirty states.\n\nIn modern times, elections have not only been manipulated by campaign ads, but by other factors as well. Social media has been one of the biggest components of what makes up modern campaigns. One very potent factor is what are called internet memes. This method may have some form of control from the candidate, but just like almost all social media, the end results are often not in the hands of the candidate. These internet memes were once known to be simple little images with jokes but now have become means of transmitting political opinions, beliefs, and thoughts on our society. One very recent, high-profile example is the 2016 presidential election. According to a recent study conducted by Forbes, political memes containing the word “MAGA” (the political campaign slogan of presidential candidate Donald Trump “Make America Great Again”) went from being mentioned once in January 2016, to 12,294 times in January 2017 with a 1,224,800% increase. Compared to other trends during that same period, it was one of the biggest growing tendencies. This also goes to show how such methods of political attack have changed and adapted so quickly. Internet memes also tend to favor a certain political candidate or party over another. In the same study, it was found that as the 2016 election date neared, there were more Internet political memes featuring presidential candidate Donald Trump than candidate Hillary Clinton. This indeed give Trump a free attention boost considering how such memes spread easily and fast across social media platforms in modern times. Also in general, it was shown as well that these memes tend to be “republican” conservative and such memes have also been seen to increase in a far more dramatic manner than such “democrat” memes. These new kinds of modern political cartoons are taking the world by storm as a new way of influencing political campaigns on the basis that they either glorify or demonize a specific candidate or party and spread this to a very large audience with little to no use of campaign funds.\n\nWhile there have been some increases in regulation of campaign finance in the United States, there is generally little regulation of political advertising content. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 addressed the issue of \"soft money\" or money contributed through political action committees, raised the legal limits of hard money that could be raised for any candidate, and set limits on what funds could be spent on election broadcasts, but it did not mandate verifiability in political campaign advertising. As of this time, there is no pending legislation addressing this issue.\n\nCurrently the Federal Communications Commission requires that the contracts for political ads shown on broadcast stations be posted online, but the agency is considering a proposal to expand that disclosure requirement to other platforms, including radio and cable.\n\nIn most EU Member States, campaign advertising is heavily regulated.\n\nIn some Member States, the United Kingdom and Ireland for example, party political advertisements on broadcast media (known as Party Political Broadcasts) are restricted to specific circumstances such as political party conferences and a limited time period before a General Election. In the latter instance political parties are allowed specific time slots on the broadcast media in which the advert may be aired. These are limited in time, offered to all registered parties and must be aired at times during the schedules that have similar levels of viewership. Furthermore, a moratorium on all election coverage is mandated on the day of the ballot.\n\nSome Member States regulate the posting of election posters at both national and municipal level. In Ireland there are restrictions on the erection of election posters which mandate the time period after an election by which time the poster must be removed, with fines as a potential sanction. Some local councils have voted to ban the placement of election posters, citing the cost of removal and the waste generated.\n\nMany municipalities in France restrict the placement of election posters to specific areas, often erecting stands specifically for that purpose.\n\nCampaign advertisement for all elections is heavily regulated in Turkey through The 1961 Law on Basic Provisions on Elections and Voter Registers (Law on Basic Provisions). The Turkish Constitution reformed under coup d'état regime in 1982, contains a number of restrictions to fundamental civil and political rights directly affecting the conduct of elections. The Law on Presidential Elections (LPE), adopted in January 2012, (following the constitutional referendum in 2007 that changed the indirect presidential election system to a direct election of the president by popular vote with an absolute majority of valid votes) regulates aspects of the new presidential election system. It was adopted in an expedited manner with limited debate and no public consultation nor support of opposition parties. OSCE stated in their election report that LPE and Law on Basic Provisions are not harmonized and LPE lacks clarity.\n\nIn contrast to advertising in the print, radio and internet media, many Member States of the European Union have consistently restricted advertising on broadcast media which are aimed at political ends, both party political advertising and political advocacy by non-partisan groups. These restrictions have been justified on the basis that the ban offers a level playing field in which money interests cannot gain an unfair advantage in the political discourse of a Member State. The broadcast media has been singled out due to its historical reach and influence.\n\nOutright bans on advertising engaged in political advocacy have been referred to the European Court of Human Rights which has held that such restrictions may be a breach of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. but the Court has held that restrictions on political advertising can be justified in certain circumstances, provided they were proportionate to the public interest they aimed to protect. Certain Member States including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Switzerland have repeatedly refused to remove their blanket bans. An attempted television ad campaign by the Association against Industrial Animal Production (VGT) which drew a comparison between battery farming and the Holocaust was persistently refused in line with Swiss law, and was the subject of two ECtHR cases, the second case resulting from the persistent refusal by Switzerland to modify its laws on political advertising. However, in a similar UK case involving Animal Rights advertising, the Court upheld the UK ban on political advertising on several grounds. It held the UK had consulted widely before legislating, the court recognized the legitimacy of limiting political advertising on television, acknowledging the argument that there was a \"risk of distortion\" of public debate by wealthy groups having unequal access to advertising, and accepted that the ban was not a ban on free speech given that other methods of communication were available. The court thus recognized that television advertising is especially powerful and thus wealthy groups could block out the valid arguments of less wealthy groups and thus distort public debate.\n\nCampaigning is done through medias, newspapers and radios. By ruling of The Cable Television Network Rules of 1994, political advertisements were prohibited. However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2004 dictated that one may apply for an advertisement to be displayed on TV, but it must be approved by a committee created by the Chief Electoral Officer; the committee consists of The Joint Chief Electoral Officer, a Returning Officer, and one expert. Additionally, the committee will only consider advertisements from registered political parties or groups or organizations whose headquarter are in the National Capital Territory of Delhi. This model was also spread to other states; they are to have a committee consisting of a Joint Chief Electoral Officer, a Returning Officer, and one expert. Just as with Delhi, the other territories are to consider applications from registered political parties or groups or organizations whose headquarter are in the territory. In all cases, the Returning Officer is the one who considers applications for advertisements. Additionally, there is a committee within every state, designated by The Chief Electoral Officer, to handle and complaints. This committee consists of The Chief Electoral Officer, an observer, and an expert. In addition to these 2004 decisions, it was decided in 2007 that these procedures would be extended national parties for the elections in the states of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThe parties are not permitted to take funds from corporate houses and the funds of the parties are non- taxable. The election commission which conducts the election sets out the rules and regulations for every election and enforces these rules as well. For example, all political parties have to stop campaigning forty eight hours before the election. Similarly politicians facing criminal charges are often disqualified and communal content in speeches are also not permitted.\nJapan distinguishes between party advertisements and candidate advertisements. There are few restrictions on political advertisements made by parties. One restriction is that party advertisements cannot mention specific candidates. Candidate advertisements have greater limitations and are paid for by the government. Candidates are not allowed to purchase their own advertisements. The number and type of candidate advertisements are also limited, including the size of newspaper advertisements, and length of television and radio advertisements. Japanese election law discourages negative campaign advertising directed at other candidates, parties, or political organizations. Campaign advertisements can only be broadcast during the two-week official campaign period and are closely monitored for violations of election law.\n\nAustralia has five advertising campaign principles. First, campaigns should be relevant to government responsibilities. Secondly, campaign materials in advertising should be presented in an objective, fair and accessible manner and be designed to meet the objectives of the campaign. Facts presented should be accurate and verifiable. The third principle states that campaign materials should be objective and not directed at promoting party interests. Campaign materials must not mention the party in government by name, or directly attack or scorn the views, policies, or actions of others. Fourth, campaigns should be justified and undertaken in an efficient, effective and relevant manner. The last principle states that campaigns must comply with legal requirements and procurement policies and procedures. This is particularly important in respecting laws with broadcasting and media. When broadcasting political advertisements during an election period, the broadcaster must give all parties contesting the election a reasonable opportunity to have election matter broadcast during the election period. This does not need to be done for free. Sponsors or current affair programs must be identified during political advertising. While Australia does not exactly have a right to free speech, they have an implied freedom of political communication. There are regulations on the format and presentation of political advertising, but little regulation on the content.\n\nIran's democratically elected president, Hassan Rouhani, is the current leader of Iran's quasi-theocratic government. The country is made up of mainly Shiite Muslims and a small minority of Sunni Muslims. The history of censorship in Iranian political advertising and campaign tactics has followed the ebb and flow of the country's religiously conservative state, dating back to the birth of the Islamic regime during the Iranian Revolution of 1979. One of the most recent examples of this censorship dates back to 2007, when Iran's \"fundamentalist-based parliament\" passed legislation that severely restricted the content and presentation of political advertising. The restrictions limited candidates in the presidential election from displaying posters, especially with their own image on them, and greatly limited the use of other publicity tools in an effort to urge candidates to give their messages through government organizations. Critics suggest that this limitation of advertising venue and medium was an attempt by the state to keep standing politicians in office and limit the information available on new candidates. Outside reports from more recent elections and campaigns claim actions such as physical attacks on journalists and campaign heads by unknown parties and the modification of campaign websites and documentaries by state agencies.\n\nArgentina passed regulations on the allocation of television and radio campaigns in preparation for the 2013 primary and legislative elections. The regulation divides programming into 4 blocks throughout the day and allocates a certain percentage of time during the slots for campaign advertisement. For television during the blocks from 7–11am and from 4–8pm, 30% percent of the time will be allocated to campaign advertisement. For the slots from 11am–4pm and 8pm–1am, 20% percent of the time will be allocated for campaign advertisement. For radio the percentage of allocation during these 4 time blocks is flipped, 11am–4pm and 8pm–1am receiving 30% of the time for campaign advertisement, and 20% for the 7–11am and 4–8pm time blocks.\n\nIndependent Communication Authority of South Africa (ICASA) established in 2000 is the regulatory body of broadcast political advertisements. It also serves to protect the message of the political advertisement from the broadcasting service. ICASA's regulations dictate the nature and acceptable content for aired political advertisements. Political party advertisements may only be authorized to be broadcast during the period of elections. A broadcasting service that airs a licensed ad must clearly state that this is in fact a political advertisement. The commercial cannot be longer than 1 minute in duration and cannot exceed 8 time slots within the designated period of elections. There is a required screening process of all political advertisements before being national redistributed. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in maximum fine of one million Rand.\n\nRussia, as well as many other countries, does not have a legal definition of \"political advertising\". Current Russian legislation regulates the form of political advertising such as election campaigns. This form involves activities to disseminate information about political forces and candidates to influence voting behaviour. Election campaign is defined as paid by a candidate, an electoral association, or other person acting in the interest of the candidate messages and materials, which encourage citizens to make the proposed action.\n\nPolitical advertising in a broad sense is not regulated by a special law and follows the general rules governing freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of association. Lack of legal definition of political advertising leads to the ambiguity of its understanding, which generates conflict situations in legal relations of advertising.\n\nMoreover, this kind of advertising in Russia has evolved relatively recently, because from 1917 to 1991 there was only one political force in the country, which had no political opponents, and used ideological propaganda as the primary means of political communication.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the key role of broadcasters is to inform potential voters on issues, political parties and candidates during an election period. This means ensuring equitable airtime for all candidates on each broadcast network. 6.5 hours of prime programing should be available for the purchase by all parties. On-air personalities running as a candidate in a provincial or federal election are required halt any on-air duties as soon as his or her candidacy is announced or the election is called. According to Elections Ontario, there are restrictions regarding when political advertising may be aired and restrictions on the rates broadcasters and publishing facilities can charge for said advertising.\n\nPolitical science research generally finds negative advertisement (which has increased over time) to be ineffective both at reducing the support and turnout for the opponent. According to political scientists Stephen Ansolabehere and Shanto Iyengar, negative ads do succeed at driving down overall turnout though. They also find that \"negative ads work better for Republicans than for Democrats, and better for men than for women; unfortunately, negative ads also work better in general than positive ones\". Challengers who spend more time campaigning get a higher vote share against incumbents in state house elections. According to political scientist Lynn Vavreck, \"the evidence suggests that campaign ads have small effects that decay rapidly—very rapidly—but just enough of the impact accumulates to make running more advertising than your opponent seem a necessity\".\nDirect effects of political campaign advertising include informing voters about candidates' positions and affecting the \"preferences and participatory ethos of the electorate\". Studies show that voting results are affected by voters' characteristics and the type of ad to which they are exposed.\n\nBoth positive and negative advertisement have been proven to play different roles in regards to candidate evaluation. Positive ads, which usually start at the beginning of a campaign aim at introducing or reintroducing a candidate through reinforcing his or her positive image and qualities. Whereas a strictly political advertisement would inform the viewer, positive campaign ads become an ongoing discussion of character—people understand more than simply just political identity. In an analysis of the dynamics that exist in campaign advertising, Jim Granato and M.C. Sunny Wong argue that \"Not only do voters associate a candidate with a particular party and its policies, but they also assess character and competence of a candidate.\" Instead of simply representing a candidate by their issues, a candidate is almost created as a character on the screen. These campaigns become affirmations of competency; they give the viewer a multi-faceted understanding of who the candidate is and who the candidate is trying to portray themselves as.\n\nNegative or attack ads have been studied for their effects on memory and ability to shape attitude towards candidates. Both variables are measured to determine the effectiveness of negative ads, which tend to be well remembered. The limitation of this technique is that it can sometimes be highly counterproductive as ads turn out to harm the attacking candidate.\n\nOne other effect of political campaign advertising includes greater attitude polarization among voters. In fact one study conducted by Gina Garramone on the effects of political advertising on the political process shows that \"by discerning clear differences between candidates, voters may be more likely to strongly like one candidate while strongly disliking the other\". This typically leads to higher levels of confidence within voters choices and can widen the degree of participation in the electoral process.\n\nOne of the most historically effective and unprecedented uses of campaign advertising took place in Chile in the year 1988. Chile's president, General Augusto Pinochet, who was notorious for ordering the torture and killing of political enemies, decided to issue a referendum in which the Chilean people could vote \"yes\" or \"no\" on the continuation of his regime. Overconfident in the idea that the majority of Chileans viewed him as a benevolent leader, Pinochet allowed his opposition fifteen minutes of airtime on the national television station each day for the twenty-seven days preceding the October 5 referendum. A creative team composed of Eugenio García, Francisco Celedón, and other members of Chile's Christian Democratic Party undertook the effort to air a hard-hitting and impactful political ad campaign against Pinochet. This campaign differed from many others in that it lacked a candidate or central ideology around which to base itself. However, instead of using negative attack ads, the campaign's creators decided to imbue their advertisements with a sense of joy, or \"alegría\". The campaign was overwhelmingly successful; 7.2 million votes were cast, with 3.96 million opposing the Pinochet regime. Pinochet stepped down peacefully in the year 1990, passing on leadership to a democratic civilian government. The results for this election were believed to have large-scale effects for worldwide democracy.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the second instance of nuclear testing conducted by India; the first test, code-named \"Smiling Buddha\", was conducted in May 1974.\n\nThe tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons. The then Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission described each one of the explosions of \"Pokhran-II\" to be \"equivalent to several tests carried out by other nuclear weapon states over decades\". Subsequently, India established computer simulation capability to predict the yields of nuclear explosives whose designs are related to the designs of explosives used in this test.\n\n\"Pokhran-II\" consisted of five detonations, the first of which was a fusion bomb while the remaining four were fission bombs. The tests were initiated on 11 May 1998, under the assigned code name \"Operation Shakti\", with the detonation of one fusion and two fission bombs. On 13 May 1998, two additional fission devices were detonated, and the Indian government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee shortly convened a press conference to declare India a full-fledged nuclear state. The tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of major states, including Japan and the United States.\n\nMany names have been assigned to these tests; originally these were collectively called \"Operation Shakti–98\", and the five nuclear bombs were designated \"Shakti-I\" through to \"Shakti-V\". More recently, the operation as a whole has come to be known as \"Pokhran II\", and the 1974 explosion as \"Pokhran-I\".\n\nEfforts towards building the nuclear bomb, infrastructure, and research on related technologies have been undertaken by India since World War II. Origins of India's nuclear program date back to 1944 when nuclear physicist Homi Bhabha began persuading the Indian Congress towards the harnessing of nuclear energy— a year later he established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).\n\nIn 1950s, the preliminary studies were carried out at the BARC and plans were developed to produce plutonium and other bomb components. In 1962, India and China engaged in the disputed northern front, and was further intimidated with Chinese nuclear test in 1964. Direction towards militarisation of the nuclear program slowed down when Vikram Sarabhai became its head and little interest of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1965.\n\nAfter Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1966, the nuclear program was consolidated when physicist Raja Ramanna joined the efforts. Another nuclear test by China eventually led to India's decision toward building nuclear weapons in 1967 and conducted its first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, in 1974.\n\nResponding to Smiling Buddha, the Nuclear Suppliers Group severely affected India's nuclear program. The world's major nuclear powers imposed technological embargo on India and Pakistan, which was technologically racing to meet with India's achievement. The nuclear program struggled for years to gain credibility and its progress was crippled by the lack of indigenous resources and dependence on imported technology and technical assistance. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared to the IAEA that India's nuclear program was not militarising despite authorising preliminary work on the hydrogen bomb design.\n\nIn the aftermath of the state emergency in 1975 that resulted in the collapse of the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government, the nuclear program was left with a vacuum of political leadership and even basic management. Work on the hydrogen bomb design continued under M. Srinivasan, a mechanical engineer, but progress was slow.\n\nThe nuclear program received little attention from Prime Minister Morarji Desai who was renowned for his peace advocacy. In 1978, Prime Minister Desai transferred physicist Ramanna to Indian MoD, and his government once again accelerated India's nuclear program.\n\nShortly thereafter, the world discovered the Pakistan's clandestine atomic bomb program. Contrary to India's nuclear program, Pakistan's atomic bomb program was akin to United States Manhattan Project, in that it was under military oversight with civilian scientists in charge of the scientific aspects of the program. The Pakistani atomic bomb program was well funded and organised by then; India realised that Pakistan was likely to succeed in its project in matter of two years.<ref name=\"http://nuclearweaponarchive.org\"></ref>\n\nIn 1980, the general elections marked the return of Indira Gandhi and the nuclear program began to gain momentum under Ramanna in 1981. Requests for additional nuclear tests continued to be denied by the government after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saw Pakistan begin engaging in brinkmanship, though the nuclear program continued to advance. Work towards the hydrogen bomb, as well as the launch of the missile programme, began under Dr. Abdul Kalam, who was then an aerospace engineer.\n\nIn 1989, the general elections witnessed the Janata Dal party led by V.P. Singh, forming the government. Prime Minister V.P. Singh downplayed the relations with the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto whose Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) won the general elections in 1988. Foreign relations between India and Pakistan severely worsened when India accused Pakistan of supporting the Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. During this time, the Indian Missile Program succeeded in the development of the \"Prithvi\" missiles.\n\nSuccessive governments in India decided to observe this temporary moratorium for fear of inviting international criticism. The Indian public had supported the nuclear tests which ultimately led Prime Minister Narasimha Rao deciding to conduct further tests in 1995. Plans were halted after American spy satellites picked up signs of preparations for nuclear testing at Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan. President Bill Clinton and his administration exerted enormous pressure on Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to stop the preparations. Responding to India, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto issued harsh criticism of India on Pakistan's news channels; thus putting stress on the relations between two countries.\n\nDiplomatic tensions escalated between India and Pakistan when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto raised the Kashmir issue at the United Nations in 1995. In a speech delivered by then-Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, Yousaf Raza Gillani, stressed the \"Kashmir problem\" as a continuing threat to peace and security in the region. The Indian delegation headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the United Nations, reiterated that the \"UN resolutions only call upon Pakistan— the occupying force to vacate the \"Jammu and Kashmir Area.\"\n\nThe BJP, came to power in 1998 general elections with an exclusive public mandate. BJP's political might had been growing steadily in strength over the past decade over several issues.\n\nIn Pakistan, the similar conservative force, the PML(N), was also in power with an exclusive mandate led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who defeated the leftist PPP led by Benazir Bhutto in the general elections held in 1997. During the BJP campaign, Atal Bihari Vajpayee indulged in grandstanding— such as when he declared on 25 February that his government would \"take back that part of Kashmir that is under Pakistan's control.\" Before this declaration, the BJP platform had clear intentions to \"exercise the option to induct nuclear weapons\" and \"India should become an openly nuclear power to garner the respect on the world stage that India deserved.\" By 18 March 1998, Vajpayee publicly began lobbying for nuclear testing and declared that \"there is no compromise on national security; all options including the nuclear options will be exercised to protect security and sovereignty.\"\n\nConsultation began between Prime Minister Vajpayee, Dr.Abdul Kalam, R. Chidambaram and officials of the Indian DAE on nuclear options. Chidambaram briefed Prime Minister Vajpayee extensively on the nuclear program; Abdul Kalam presented the status of the missile program. On 28 March 1998, Prime Minister Vajpayee asked the scientists to make preparations in the shortest time possible, and preparations were hastily made.\n\nPakistan, at a Conference on Disarmament, offered a peace agreement with India for \"an equal and mutual restraint in conventional, missile and nuclear fields.\" Pakistan's equation was later reemphasised on 6 April and the momentum in India for nuclear tests began to build up which strengthened Vajpayee's position to order the tests.\n\nUnlike Pakistan's weapon–testing laboratories, there was very little that India could do to hide its activity at Pokhran. Unlike the high-altitude granite mountains in Pakistan, the bushes are sparse and the dunes in the Rajasthan Desert don't provide much cover from probing satellites. The Indian Intelligence Agency had been aware of United States spy satellites and the American CIA had been detecting Indian test preparations since 1995. Therefore, the tests required complete secrecy in India and also needed to avoid detection by other countries. The 58th Engineer Regiment of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers was commissioned to prepare the test sites to avoid detection by the United States spy satellites. The 58th Engineer's commander Colonel Gopal Kaushik supervised the test preparations and ordered his \"staff officers take all measures to ensure total secrecy.\"\n\nExtensive planning was done by a small group of scientists, senior military officers and senior politicians to ensure that the test preparations would remain secret, and even senior members of the Indian government didn't know what was going on. The chief scientific adviser and the Director of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Dr. Abdul Kalam, and Dr. R. Chidambaram, the Director of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), were the chief coordinators of this test planning. The scientists and engineers of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMDER), and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were involved in the nuclear weapon assembly, layout, detonation and data collection. A small group of senior scientists were involved in the detonation process. All scientists were required to wear army uniforms to preserve the secrecy of the tests. Since 1995, the 58th Engineer Regiment had learned how to avoid satellite detection. Work was mostly done during night, and equipment was returned to the original place to give the impression that it was never moved.\n\nBomb shafts were dug under camouflage netting and the dug-out sand was shaped like dunes. Cables for sensors were covered with sand and concealed using native vegetation. Scientists would not depart for Pokhran in groups of two or three. They travelled to destinations other than Pokhran under pseudonyms, and were then transported by the army. Technical staff at the test range wore military uniforms, to prevent detection in satellite images.\n\nThe main technical personnel involved in the operation were:\n\n\nThree laboratories of the DRDO were involved in designing, testing and producing components for the bombs, including the advanced detonators, the implosion and high-voltage trigger systems. These were also responsible for weaponising, systems engineering, aerodynamics, safety interlocks and flight trials. The bombs were transported in four Indian Army trucks under the command of Colonel Umang Kapur; all devices from BARC were relocated at 3 am on 1 May 1998. From the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, the bombs were flown in an Indian Air Force's AN-32 commanded by Squadron Leader Mahendra Prasad Sharma plane to Jaisalmer. They were transported to Pokhran in an army convoy of four trucks, and this required three trips. The devices were delivered to the device preparation building, which was designated as 'Prayer Hall'.\n\nThe test sites was organised into two government groups and were fired separately, with all devices in a group fired at the same time. The first group consisted of the thermonuclear device (\"Shakti I\"), the fission device (\"Shakti II\"), and a sub-kiloton device (\"Shakti III\"). The second group consisted of the remaining two sub-kiloton devices \"Shakti IV\" and \"V\". It was decided that the first group would be tested on 11 May and the second group on 13 May. The thermonuclear device was placed in a shaft code named 'White House', which was over deep, the fission bomb was placed in a deep shaft code named 'Taj Mahal', and the first sub-kiloton device in 'Kumbhkaran'. The first three devices were placed in their respective shafts on 10 May, and the first device to be placed was the sub-kiloton device in the 'Kumbhkaran' shaft, which was sealed by the army engineers by 8:30 pm. The thermonuclear device was lowered and sealed into the 'White House' shaft by 4 am, and the fission device being placed in the 'Taj Mahal' shaft was sealed at 7:30 am, which was 90 minutes before the planned test time. The shafts were L-shaped, with a horizontal chamber for the test device.\n\nThe timing of the tests depended on the local weather conditions, with the wind being the critical factor. The tests were underground, but due to a number of shaft seal failures that had occurred during tests conducted by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, the sealing of the shaft could not be guaranteed to be leak-proof. By early afternoon, the winds had died down and the test sequence was initiated. Dr. K. Santhanam of the DRDO, in charge of the test site preparations, gave the two keys that activated the test countdown to Dr. M. Vasudev, the range safety officer, who was responsible for verifying that all test indicators were normal. After checking the indicators, Vasudev handed one key each to a representative of BARC and the DRDO, who unlocked the countdown system together. At 3:45 pm the three devices were detonated.\n\nFive nuclear devices were made during Operation Shakti. Four of the devices were weapon-grade plutonium and one Thorium/U-233. They were:\n\n\nAn additional, sixth device (Shakti VI) is suspected to have been present but not detonated.\n\nAt 3:43 pm IST; three nuclear bombs (specifically, the \"Shakti I\", II and III) were detonated simultaneously, as measured by international seismic monitors. On 13 May, at 12.21 p.m.IST 6:51 UTC, two sub-kiloton devices (\"Shakti IV\" and V) were detonated. Due to their very low yield, these explosions were not detected by any seismic station. On 13 May 1998, India declared the series of tests to be over after this.\n\nFollowing the Pokhran-II tests, India became the sixth country to join the nuclear club. Shortly after the tests, a press meet was convened at the Prime Minister's residence in New Delhi. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appeared before the press corps and made the following short statement:\n\nNews of the tests were greeted with jubilation and large-scale approval by society in India. The Bombay Stock Exchange registered significant gains. Newspapers and television channels praised the government for its bold decision; editorials were full of praise for the country's leadership and advocated the development of an operational nuclear arsenal for the country's armed forces. The Indian opposition, led by Congress Party criticised the Vajpayee administration for carrying out the series of nuclear tests. The Congress Party spokesperson Salman Khursheed, accused the BJP of trying to use the tests for political ends rather than to enhance the country's national security.\n\nBy the time India had conducted tests, the country had a total of $44bn in loans in 1998, from the IMF and the World Bank. The industrial sectors of the Indian economy, such as the chemicals industry, were likely to be hurt by sanctions. The Western consortium companies, which had invested heavily in India, especially in construction, computing and telecoms, were generally the ones who were harmed by the sanctions. In 1998, Indian government announced that it had already allowed for some economic response and was willing to take the consequences.\n\nStrong criticism was drawn from Canada on India's actions and its High Commissioner. Sanctions were also imposed by Japan on India and consisted of freezing all new loans and grants except for humanitarian aid to India.\n\nSome other nations also imposed sanctions on India, primarily in the form of suspension of to India and government-to-government credit lines. However, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia refrained from condemning India.\n\nOn 12 May the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated: \"The Chinese government is seriously concerned about the nuclear tests conducted by India,\" and that the tests \"run counter to the current international trend and are not conducive to peace and stability in South Asia.\". The next day the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued the statement clearly stating that \"it is shocked and strongly condemned\" the Indian nuclear tests and called for the international community to \"adopt a unified stand and strongly demand that India immediate stop development of nuclear weapons\". China further rejected India's stated rationale of needing nuclear capabilities to counter a Chinese threat as \"totally unreasonable\". In a meeting with Masayoshi Takemura of Democratic Party of Japan, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China Qian Qichen was quoted as saying that India's nuclear tests were a \"serious matter,\" particularly because they were conducted in light of the fact that more than 140 countries have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \"It is even more unacceptable that India claims to have conducted the tests to counter what it called a \"\"China threat\"\". On 24 November 1998, the Chinese Embassy, New Delhi issued a formal statement:\n\nThe most vehement and strong reaction to India's nuclear explosion was from a neighbouring country, Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan, which issued a severe statement blaming India for instigating a nuclear arms race in the region. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed that his country would give a suitable reply to India. The day after the first tests, Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan indicated that Pakistan was ready to conduct a nuclear test. He stated: \"Pakistan is prepared to match India, we have the capability... We in Pakistan will maintain a balance with India in all fields\", he said in an interview. \"We are in a headlong arms race on the subcontinent.\"\n\nOn 13 May 1998, Pakistan bitterly condemned the tests, and Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub was quoted as saying that Indian leadership seemed to \"have gone berserk [sic] and was acting in a totally unrestrained way.\" Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was much more subdued, maintaining ambiguity about whether a test would be conducted in response: \"\"We are watching the situation and we will take appropriate action with regard to our security\"\", he said. Sharif sought to mobilise the entire Islamic world in support of Pakistan and criticised India for nuclear proliferation.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif had been under intense pressure regarding the nuclear tests by President Bill Clinton and Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto at home. Initially surprising the world, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif authorised a nuclear testing program and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) carried out nuclear testing under the codename \"Chagai-I\" on 28 May 1998 and \"Chagai-II\" on 30 May 1998. These six underground nuclear tests at the Chagai and Kharan test site were conducted fifteen days after India's last test. The total yield of the tests was reported to be 40 kt (see codename: \"Chagai-I\").\n\nPakistan's subsequent tests invited similar condemnation from the United States. American President Bill Clinton was quoted as saying \"Two wrongs don't make a right\", criticising Pakistan's tests as reactionary to India's Pokhran-II. The United States and Japan reacted by imposing economic sanctions on Pakistan. According to the Pakistan's science community, the Indian nuclear tests gave an opportunity to Pakistan to conduct nuclear tests after 14 years of conducting only cold tests (See: Kirana-I).\n\nPakistan's leading nuclear physicist, Pervez Hoodbhoy, held India responsible for Pakistan's nuclear test experiments in Chagai.\n\nThe United States issued a strong statement condemning India and promised that sanctions would follow. The American intelligence community was embarrassed as there had been \"a serious intelligence failure of the decade\" in detecting the preparations for the test.\n\nIn keeping with its preferred approach to foreign policy in recent decades, and in compliance with the 1994 anti-proliferation law, the United States imposed economic sanctions on India. The sanctions on India consisted of cutting off all assistance to India except humanitarian aid, banning the export of certain defence material and technologies, ending American credit and credit guarantees to India, and requiring the US to oppose lending by international financial institutions to India.\n\nFrom 1998–1999, the United States held series of bilateral talks with India over the issue of India becoming party of the CTBT and NPT. In addition, the United States also made an unsuccessful attempt of holding talks regarding the rollback of India's nuclear program. India took a firm stand against the CTBT and refusing to be signatory party of it despite under pressure by the US President Bill Clinton, and noted the treaty as it was not consistent with India's national security interest.\n\nThe reactions from abroad started immediately after the tests were advertised. On 6 June, the United Nations Security Council adopted \"Resolution 1172\" condemning the test and that of Pakistan's. China issued a vociferous condemnation calling upon the international community to exert pressure on India to sign the NPT and eliminate its nuclear arsenal. With India joining the group of countries possessing nuclear weapons, a new strategic dimension had emerged in Asia, particularly South Asia.\n\nThe Indian government has officially declared 11 May as National Technology Day in India to commemorate the first of the five nuclear tests that were carried out on 11 May 1998.\n\nIt was officially signed by then-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998 and the day is celebrated by giving awards to various individuals and industries in the field of science and technology.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188347", "title": "Webtoon", "text": "Webtoon\n\nWebtoons (Hangul: 웹툰) are a type of digital comic that originated in South Korea. While webtoons were mostly unknown outside of the country during their inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in great part to most manhwa being read on smartphones.\n\nAs digital manhwa have emerged as a popular medium, print publication of manhwa in South Korea has decreased. The amount of material published in webtoon form has now reached an equal amount as that published offline.\n\nThere are three things that set webtoons apart from regular comics: each episode is published on one long, vertical strip (making use of an infinite canvas rather than multiple pages so that it is easier to read on a smartphone or computer); they will most likely be in color rather than black-and-white since they are rarely published in physical form; and some will feature music and animations that play during each chapter. In the case of South Korea, there are also different censorship laws for materials published online than in print which has led to more manhwa that is pornographic in nature being produced and published as webtoons.\n\nLike other online publications, there are a variety of payment models used for webtoons. Some offer a limited set of chapters for free and charge for the rest. Others allow only a certain number of chapters to be read per day without payment.\n\nCreators of webtoons can earn money from ads displayed on their series. Until 2019, amateur creators could earn money from the credit that was given by their fans. The money that the pro and amateur creators receive depends on the page view..\n\nThe Korean web portal Daum created a webtoon service known as Daum Webtoon in 2003 and was later followed by Naver with the launch of Naver Webtoon in 2004. These services regularly release webtoons that are available for free. According to David Welsh of Bloomberg, comics account for a quarter of all book sales in South Korea, while more than 3 million Korean users paid to access online manhwa and 10 million users read free webtoons.\n\n, Naver had published 520 webtoons while Daum had published 434. Since the early 2010s, services such as TappyToon and Spottoon have begun to officially translate webtoons into English while some Korean publishers like Lezhin and Toomics have begun to self translate their works. Examples of popular webtoons that have been translated into English are \"Lookism\", \"Untouchable\", \"Yumi's Cells\", \"Tales of the Unusual\", \"The God of High School\", \"Noblesse\", and \"Tower of God\". In recent years, these webtoons have been gaining popularity in Western markets, rivalling Japanese manga.\n\nIn the past, it was divided into two ratings: All (webtoon suitable for all ages) and 18 (No one under 18 is allowed to read this webtoon). From May 2019, the webtoon rating system was implemented. It is said that 10 platforms including Naver and Daum will participate. The ratings are expected to be △ All △ 12 years or older △ 15 years or older △ 19 years old (18 years old) or older.\n\nThe earliest webtoons were scanned original comics uploaded onto the Internet, usually formatted on a one-page layout.\n\nWith the development of technology, authors were able to utilise flash animation effects.\n\nEnhanced preloading enabled later authors to adopt a vertical layout with scrolling. In contrast to comics with a dense panel composition, scrolling brings new panels into view. This makes webtoons suitable for gradual and continuous representation, allowing webtoon reading to become more fluid. \n\nWith the advent of the smartphone and tablet, webtoons have also migrated to new platforms such as apps. There have also been sounds introduced to imply further expressions and tones, as well as interactive motions to create excitement and bring attention to certain objects for the viewers.\n\nPrior to 2014, most webtoons were only available in English through unofficial fan translations. In July 2014, Naver subsidiary Line began publication of translations of popular webtoons to English via the WEBTOON service.\n\nThe market for webtoons and their derivatives is currently valued at around KR₩420 billion (US$368 million).\n\nAlthough digital comics are increasingly popular, print publication remains the primary means of comic retail. Some publishers offer online content and print content simultaneously.\n\nWebtoons have been taken as source material by a number of different mediums, including film and television; one of the earliest examples of this was \"'Tazza\", a 2006 film based on the comic by Huh Young-man. This work was serialized in the Sports Chosun and garnered over 100 million homepage views, later being adapted into two films. (, ), and one television series (Tazza (TV series)). Another of Huh's works, \"Sikgaek (Le Grand Chef)\", was published in the Dong-a Ilbo for five years and sold 540,000 copies in paperback version.\n\nNaver's WEBTOON service, launched in 2014, is now the biggest webtoon platform in Korea. According to Naver, it reaches over 6.2 million daily users. The free WEBTOON translation service has allowed webtoons to form part of the global Korean Wave.\n\nThey also collaborate with movies.\n\nThe webtoon format has also expanded to other countries with many different distributors offering original and translated webtoons for users to read as well as offering platforms for anyone to upload their own webtoons.\n\nIn mainland China and Taiwan, webtoons along with web manhua have seen an increase in production and popularity since they are rarely published and just like in South Korea, have resulted in a resurgence and interest in the manhua industry as more content is consumed digitally. Almost all of the big webtoon portals in China are offered by the big internet companies in the country while in Taiwan the bigger webtoon publishers outside of the country like Comico, Toomics, and WEBTOON are more popular since their services are available there.\n\nIndonesia and Thailand have become big markets for the webtoon industry with both Naver (under WEBTOON) and Comico offering both original webtoons and fully translated titles in the two countries. Some webtoons made in Indonesia and Thailand have even been translated and published outside of the countries like \"Eggnoid\". Vietnam launched its first webtoon portal, Vinatoon, offering translated titles from Daum Webtoon and Mr. Blue with the intention of opening up another market.\n\nMany of the webtoon publishers have had success in penetrating markets outside of Asia with the biggest success being the United States and other English speaking countries. Lezhin, Toomics, and Naver are the only big publishers who translate their own titles rather than licensing them out and Naver (under the Line brand) even offers the ability for fan translations to be offered in different languages. Spottoon and TappyToon offer translated licensed works from various publishers including KToon, Bomtoon, Foxtoon, and many more. Besides just the consumption of translated works, there has also been a rise in the creation of original non-Asian webtoons thanks in part to sites like Tapas and WEBTOON offering the ability for anyone to submit their own work. In the beginning, many of the webtoons created outside of Asia tended to just be webcomics released in the webtoon format but over time, more artists have released more titles that are full-fledged comics rather than reformatted webcomics.\n\nDelitoon is another platform only for French people based in France, providing translated licensed works mainly from Korean content providers. \n\nWebtoons in Japan have not caught on as well as in other countries mainly due to the traditional manga industry still being the main way in which manga get released and published. Even web manga, which have seen a recent rise in popularity, get released in black-and-white and not color like in Korea or China despite being released digitally. Despite this, there have been some strides to penetrate the Japanese market and slowly more mangaka are trying out the webtoon format to release their titles. Lezhin, Comico, Naver, Line, and Kakao offer webtoon portals with translated works for Japanese readers. Comico, one of the biggest webtoon publishers in the world, was actually created by the Japanese subsidiary of NHN Entertainment, NHN Japan. To date, there are only two webtoon portals that offer original Japanese webtoons, Comico and Naver (under the name XOY 2017-2018 to 2019). All XOY webtoons have been integrated onto Line Manga a Japanese Manga service while XOY was up until its demise in January 2019. Kakao has also had success in the Japanese market by offering both licensed manga and translated Korean webtoons with their service, Piccoma. This has been credited to the webtoon pay model that the service implements where some chapters are offered for free for a short period of time. Kakao Japan has announced that it will start offering original Japanese, Korean, and Chinese webtoons for Piccoma in the summer of 2018.\n\n\n"}

In the case of recordable media, this spiral contains a slight sinusoidal deviation from a perfect spiral. The period of this sine curve corresponds to the wobble frequency. The wobble frequency is commonly used as a synchronization source to achieve constant linear velocity while writing a disc, but has other uses as well depending on the type of disc. The frequencies quoted all assume that the disc is being written at the '1x' speed. The frequencies are appropriately higher for faster writing speeds.\n\nCD-R and CD-RW discs use a frequency modulated wobble of 140.6 kHz to encode information, such as the Absolute Time in Pregroove (ATIP), into the groove. \n\nDVD-R and DVD-RW have a constant wobble frequency of 140.6 kHz relying on data 'pits' beside the groove to convey information (Land pre-pit).\n\nDVD+R and DVD+RW have a constant wobble frequency of 817.4 kHz, but encodes its addressing information by periodically inverting the phase of the wobble signal (bi-phase modulation) to encode an exact address of the location on the spiral track (Address in Pregroove). The practical upshot of this arrangement is that the recording drive can navigate to an exact location on the DVD+R(W) disc whereas it cannot do so with the DVD-R(W).\n\nBD-R and BD-RE discs utilise Address in Pregrove. \n\nHD DVD-R and HD DVD-RW use the land pre-pit system of the DVD-R(W).\n"}
{"id": "2188379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188379", "title": "Phantom Manor", "text": "Phantom Manor\n\nPhantom Manor is a dark ride attraction in Frontierland at Disneyland Park in Disneyland Paris. Phantom Manor is the park's version of the Haunted Mansion attractions at Disneyland, Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, although a lot of scenes from the Haunted Mansion have been reimagined to coincide with a darker theme. It opened with Euro Disneyland on April 12, 1992. \n\nThe attraction combines a walk-through portion with Omnimover vehicles and features special effects and Audio-Animatronics. This version of the popular Haunted Mansion rides has a different plot line. It is also designed to be scarier and darker than the other Haunted Mansion rides. The ride also features a unique soundtrack, differing from the American and Japanese versions.\n\nWhile planning Euro Disneyland, Tony Baxter, executive designer for Walt Disney Imagineering, decided that certain staple Disney attractions would have to be modified for the new park. The Haunted Mansion was among these and was given a darker tone than the original attraction. Jeff Burke was assigned the role of executive producer for the construction of this park's version of Frontierland and, with help from Imagineer Bob Baranick and show writer Craig Fleming, it was decided that the story related to Phantom Manor would have to be congruent with that of Thunder Mesa, the fictional town portrayed in Frontierland. A similar treatment was given to the Paris version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.\n\nA major influence for the story of the ride was Gaston Leroux's novel, \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the secondary plot focusing on the abandoned bride Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, as well as many European gothic legends, which were altered for a Western setting. The architectural style is Victorian Second Empire. Imagineer Marc Davis disliked the derelict aspect of the building, stating \"Walt would never approve of it.\" Like the other Haunted Mansion rides, only the first scene takes place in the mansion structure itself, the remainder of the ride takes place in a building hidden from park guests.\n\nThe architecture is in the Second Empire style. Inspiration for Paris's Frontierland architecture was provided by historic buildings in Virginia City, Nevada, specifically the Fourth Ward School for Phantom Manor.\n\nThe story of Phantom Manor was inspired by the never-built Western River Expedition, which was a Pirates of the Caribbean-style attraction designed by Marc Davis for Walt Disney World's Frontierland.\n\nHenry Ravenswood (born 1795) was a Western settler who struck gold in Big Thunder Mountain and founded the Thunder Mesa Mining Company, thus creating the city of Thunder Mesa (Frontierland as a whole). Ravenswood became rich and built himself a Victorian manor high on Boot Hill overlooking Big Thunder Mountain, where he lived with his wife Martha (born 1802) and his daughter, Melanie Ravenswood (born 1842).\n\nBig Thunder Mountain was rumored by natives to be home to the Thunder Bird, a powerful spirit possessing a treasure. According to the legend, its wrath could be materialized into a terrible earthquake. However, Ravenswood would not believe such stories. Years went by and the gold in Big Thunder Mountain became scarce, making miners dig deeper into the mountain. \n\nMelanie grew from a young girl into a beautiful young woman and became drawn to several suitors who planned to take her far away from Thunder Mesa, much to the dismay of Henry. Henry did everything he could to stop this, with the first four being subjected to various cruel fates. Sawyer Bottom was sawed in half by a saw blade, Captian Rowan D. Falls fell off of a waterfall, Ignatius \"Iggy\" Knight was blown up by dynamite and Barry Claude was mauled to death by a bear. With Bottom, Falls, Knight and Claude all dead, Henry's attempts became useless in order to stop Melanie in the midst of being engaged to a train engineer named Jake were put to a stop when a terrible earthquake killed him and Martha in 1860. It seemed the Thunder Bird had been awakened and the family was never heard of again. After several years, the story of what really happened came out from underneath the rubble:\n\nOn Melanie's wedding day, a mysterious Phantom unknown to anyone appeared in the house. Unbeknownst to anyone, this was the spirit of Henry himself, seeking vengeance on Jake for his defiance of him. While Melanie was preparing in her room, Henry lured Jake up to the attic where he hanged him by the neck from the rafters. \nIn the ballroom, the bride sat alone. Hours went by with no sign of the groom. Guests slowly filed away, leaving Melanie alone in the house with the staff of maids and butlers. \"Some day\", she told herself, \"he will come\". And so, having never taken off her wedding dress or dropped her flower bouquet, in preparation for her loved one's return, she wandered the house aimlessly, singing melancholy songs of lost love.\n\nBut Henry was still in the house, laughing at his daughter's devotion to her intended husband. One after one, Henry invited his dead, demonic friends from the afterlife to fill the house in an eternal party. A dark curse fell upon the house and the shape of the house was slowly transformed by the evil forces. No one ever set foot in the house ever since.\n\nInside and outside, the house was decaying with age. Dusty cobwebs covered every inch, the disheartened staff not caring, for it was rumored that Melanie had lost her mind. She wandered the house for years and years, singing softly to her groom, while all around her demons and ghosts reveled and danced. Everywhere she went she was reminded of the wedding. Her father's eternal laughter still carried through the walls of the house. Outside, the once beautiful grounds were falling apart and crumbling. The gilded staircase and structure were dotted with mold and trees and every plant on the grounds died. As if sensing the evil inherent in the house, nothing living ever trod there. Even so, Melanie kept her hopes, waiting for her love's return and never figured why he didn't show up at the wedding.\n\nThe earthquake that killed her parents all those years ago cut a huge gouge in the west half of the property and in the crumbling ghost town of the old Thunder Mesa. The deserted buildings were rumored to be called Phantom Canyon, the dark supernatural version of the town and anyone who entered the ghastly old town at night never came back. \n\nToday, no one knows if Melanie Ravenswood is still alive in that old house on the hill. If she is, then she is well over 100 years old. Her beautiful voice still carries over the town at night though, through the walls of the house and night air. And sometimes, people still see lights in the house. \n\nSome nights, when the moon is full and the sky is clear of clouds, one can still hear the lonely mourning of the bride, the maniacal laughter of Henry, and the faint tinkle of glass and the laughter of party guests. Whether she is alive or not, what is well known is that poor Melanie never really left the crumbling mansion. She waits for a groom until Judgment Day. And if you set foot in the house, her eye might be on you...\n\nLike the Haunted Mansions located in other Disney parks, only the introduction of the ride (the Octagonal Portrait Gallery) takes place in the visible Manor. The actual ride itself takes place in a large warehouse-style show building hidden behind the Manor.\n\nPhantom Manor's Omnimover portion is similar to the Disneyland Haunted Mansion's system. The track layouts of both are almost identical, but not completely. The main difference is that Phantom Manor's track is slightly longer, primarily to accommodate the Phantom Canyon scenes that substitute for the graveyard scenes in the other rides. Many scenes from the classic Haunted Mansions are replicated, but altered to incorporate the new Western theme and plot, such as the Octagonal Portrait Gallery, the Portrait Corridor, the Endless Hallway, the Conservatory, the Corridor of Doors, Madame Leota’s Seance Room, the Ballroom, and even the busts singing \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\".\n\nIn the original Haunted Mansions at Disneyland, the Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, the mansion was designed to look clean and aesthetically pleasing. Phantom Manor, however, is designed to look clearly derelict and stands at the top of a small hill, looking out onto the southern side of Big Thunder Mountain, with a commanding view of the washed out trestle, the mine elevator, and the second lift hill. The Manor's grounds are untended, overgrown with weeds and scattered with dead vegetation.\n\nUpon entering the grounds, guests can see a bat guard box and a plaque on the wall which reads \"Phantom Manor – Non Omnis Moriar\" (Latin for \"I shall not die completely\"). A derelict gazebo stands on the lawn that has a tea set laid out. Originally, these used to move to mimic two people pouring and drinking tea, at night, the light in the gazebo flickers. The gazebo also contains a music box playing within (since 1999, this music box track is also used in Disneyland's version for use on the annual seasonal overlay). This is also the only mansion in any of the parks that has guests enter the ride through the front door. Shadows and lights can be seen from within the house at nighttime. Melanie can also be seen from a window in the façade carrying a candle from one window to the next.\n\nGuests walk up the pathways towards the Manor, along the porch and queue outside the house where they wait for admission. A cast member dressed as a macabre servant opens the doors and invites a small group of them into the foyer.\n\nThis foyer contains a dusty chandelier and two mirrors, and is lined with dark wood panelling. The voice of the Phantom sounds from the ceiling and around the room, politely welcoming guests, telling them the Legend of this place and inviting them to explore the Manor further. Melanie's face fades in and out of the smallest mirror during the narration.\n\nIn the 2019 refurbishment an additional effect was added to the foyer. The small mirror was replaced by a painting of Melanie in her wedding gown, looking sad, and Jake, standing behind her outside the decrepit house also sad. A tree with no leaves is also behind them with 4 hearts crossed out and a noose hanging from one of its branches revealing Jake's fate. When the voice of the Ghost Host starts telling guests the legend of the Manor, the painting changes. It now shows a happier Melanie, dressed in summer clothes, while Jake is now smiling and resting one hand on Melanie. The Manor is in pristine condition, and the tree, now with leaves, has one heart and a swing hanging from its branches. Lighting effects also transform the wallpaper in the room from old and torn to brand-new.\n\nThe Phantom was originally voiced by Vincent Price, but legal agreements that required the narration to be primarily in French meant that a French writer, Gérard Chevalier, was brought in to record a French version of Price's narration, which was only used for the first few months of the attraction's operation. Chevalier used to be a dub for Price in many of his movies. However, a small piece of Price's recording was kept in use: the Phantom's maniacal laughter. \n\nIn 2018, it was announced that during Phantom Manor's major renovation, parts of Price's narration would be restored to the soundtrack of the attraction. For the 2019 re-opening, the new tracks feature Price once again, original excerpts as well as previously unused material from his 1990 recording, spoken English, with French actor Bernarde Alane doing the parts in French. The Phantom says (French lines \"in italics\", translated into English below):\n\n'When hinges creak in doorless chambers, \"when strange and frighting sounds are heard all around,\" when candlelight flickers though the air is deathly still, \"that is the time when the Phantom manifests\". Welcome curious friends, it is so nice to have guests. \"We welcome you, humble mortals, to this mysterious manor\". You may not believe it but beauty once lived in this house. \"Phantom Manor had happier days, but times have changed\". And now curious souls, come, I have more to show you. \"Enter brave mortals into this famous manor together\".'\n\nGuests then enter an octagonal room with four portraits of a young Melanie, with each of her four suitors. The Phantom comments on the gallery, referring to the 'sweet innocence of youth'. Shortly after, Melanie fades away from each of the paintings, with only the suitors left and the Phantom acknowledges a 'disquieting metamorphosis' and that 'not all tales have happy endings'.\n\nSuddenly the room appears to stretch upwards and the paintings grow taller, revealing what happened to each of Melanie's suitors: \n\nThe Phantom comments \"It appears everyone is doomed at Phantom Manor. Even you.\" He goes on to add that the chamber has no windows and no doors, offering the guests a \"chilling challenge\": to find a way out. After his maniacal laughter echoes away, he adds that \"the Phantom\" (referring to himself) would be happy to help them — lightning and thunder effects fill the space as the ceiling turns invisible and the Phantom reveals himself in the attic, holding a noose and sinisterly laughing. Then suddenly, lights go out completely and the guests are shrouded in darkness. The gallery's lights slowly come back on and a hidden door opens, revealing a hallway lined with portraits. The Phantom apologizes for frightening the guests prematurely and beckons them further into the Manor, and states that \"the real beauty of this house awaits us, farther on, and she's dying to meet you, but beware of the Phantom\" (once again referencing himself). \n\nFrom 1992 to 2018, the four portraits were of a young Melanie, pictured in more felicitous times, only to stretch to reveal more macabre situations:\n\nThe scene revealed in the attic was also slightly different until 2018; instead of just showing the Phantom evilly laughing, he was hanging Jake Evans, Melanie's sole groom in the original version of the attraction.\n\nLike in the Disneyland version of the ride, the Octagonal Portrait Gallery is actually a pair of cleverly disguised OTIS elevators. The floor is lowered and the ceiling is raised slowly at the same time to provide the stretching illusion. This serves the double purpose of both dramatic effect, while lowering guests from the Manor to where the actual ride begins at real ground level in a separate warehouse-style show building behind the berm, hidden by a forest of trees to render it invisible from riders on Big Thunder Mountain and the rest of the park. The ceiling above is actually a scrim, which conceals the Phantom until he is backlit from above.\n\nStepping out of the Stretching Room, guests walk down the Portrait Corridor, which takes them from the Manor visible from within the park into the show building that houses the actual ride, unlike the Disneyland version, this corridor does not pass under the park's railroad (which instead travels behind the show building and has the Grand Canyon Diorama in this area to obscure the show building). As the guests walk down the corridor, they see four portraits, slowly morphing into more macabre images.\n\nThe original paintings were all of which were taken from California (and have since been added to Walt Disney World) version of the ride:\n\nWhile the portrait of the sailing ship, though changed slightly, was retained in the 2019 refurbishment, the other three were all replaced with:\n\nAt the end of the hallway stands a large portrait of Melanie Ravenswood, wearing her bridal gown, from which she can be heard singing.\n\nGuests then turn a corner and enter the loading area, a large hall with the Grand Staircase leading to the upper floor. One can see a ghostly, foggy landscape with flashes and bolts of lightning through the huge window above the stairs, and Melanie standing on the midway landing. Old furniture line the walls, and sitting on a shelf is a bust of a stern-looking woman, who stares at guests and seems to follow them as they pass by. An unbroken train of black Omnimover vehicles known as \"carriages\" move through the center of the room, alongside a moving platform to enable easy loading.\n\nGuests board the carriages, each accommodating two to three persons and then move upwards to the show building's main floor. Prior to 2019, guests would pass a young Melanie bowing while holding a candelabra and singing the entire time. After the renovations, Melanie is moved to the loading area and now a twitching suit of armor is in her place (a reference to when Disneyland's Haunted Mansion had a live actor in a knight costume in 1969).\n\nAfter passing the armor is a seemingly Endless Hallway, with the vision of Melanie and the Phantom appearing and disappearing in the distance while the candelabra that she is holding remains in view. \n\nOn the left side of the Corridor is a Conservatory containing a piano, adorned with the wreaths of the deceased suitors. At first glance, it seems to be playing a minor chord version of \"The Wedding March\" by itself, but one can notice a ghost pianist's shadow falling on the carpet (this effect is achieved by the use of mechanical keys). A large, red-eyed raven sits on a music stand next to the piano and squawks madly. \n\nThe carriages then travel through a corridor lined with doors. As guests pass each door, they hear pounding, knocking, or shouting behind it, and the knockers seem to move by themselves, as if their inhabitants are struggling to get out. When the last door is reached, guests can see two skeletal hands clutching at the top, trying to force their way through, with the skeleton yelling \"Let me out of here!\" (It uses the same audio as the skeleton attempting to escape his coffin in the Conservatory in the other Haunted Mansions). The carriages pass a small hall containing a demonic grandfather clock, with a large \"13\" on its face (instead of the usual 12) and its hands spinning backward as it chimes. The walls are lined with wallpaper covered in demon eyes, of which start to glow green.\n\nThe carriages then enter a round Seance Room, where a crystal ball sits on a floating central table and at one time, ghostly shapes appeared in the windows surrounding the room. In it is the witch, Madame Leota's disembodied head. Behind her is a raven perched on a chair. As guests watch her, she summons ghosts and dark creatures to a mysterious ball in both English and French (translated in English below):\n\n'Goblins and Ghoulies, creatures of fright, we summon you now, to dance through the night!\n\"Spirits and ghosts, on your proud stallions, accompany the beautiful bride through the night!\"\nWarlocks and Witches, answer this call! Your presence is wanted at this ghostly ball!\n\"From the twelve knolls of midnight to the morning bells, we shall waltz together, gruesome debutante!\"\nJoin now the Spirits in Nuptial Doom, a ravishing Bride, a vanishing Groom...'\n\nGuests leave the Seance Room and move along a balcony, looking down into the Ballroom, where a ghostly wedding party takes place. Melanie stands on a staircase, singing while the Phantom stands behind her, laughing at her as lightning flashes behind him. Ghostly guests enter the room, bringing in wedding presents, then sitting around the dining table, where a moldy wedding cake is waiting for them. Drunken ghosts swing precariously from the chandelier above the table. Elegantly dressed pairs of ghostly dancers twirl around the Ballroom, as a spirit organist sits at a massive organ, playing a haunting waltz on it as wraiths fly out of its pipes. Apart from plot-related retheming, this scene is similar to the regular Haunted Mansions' ballrooms. During soft-opening previews after the 2019 refurbishment, the music here was temporarily replaced with the equivalent music from the regular Haunted Mansions, but was switched back after backlash.\n\nLeaving the Ballroom, the vehicles enter the Bride's Boudoir (which replaces the attic scene in the regular rides). A dying fire is crackling in the fireplace. Guests then see Melanie who has given up looking for her long lost groom. Melanie sits weeping into a mirror as an old woman while her father's skeletal face stares back at her. All the while, a music box plays, as well as an old gramophone. Prior to 2019, Melanie in this scene was still an old lady, but the mirror was fogged up to look like an actual skull, in reference to the Allan Gilbert painting All is Vanity. The clock displayed in the room has a blade pendulum, in reference to Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" which was also the basis for a movie featuring Vincent Price.\n\nThe carriages leave the Bride's Boudoir through open double doors and glide across a terrace and then into a stormy graveyard, past the Phantom with a shovel (whose skeletal face is revealed) standing before an open grave, with an undead dog growling beside him. The Phantom laughs as the Doombuggies pass by. This is Phantom Manor's version of the friendly but frightened groundskeeper and his dog in the other Haunted Mansions. The carriages then travel underground to the catacombs (presumably Boot Hill) and see a series of coffins being opened by their skeletal residents as well as the skeleton hands attempting to pry open a coffin from the inside, usually in the conservatory scene in the Haunted Mansion. The Singing Busts then come into view, singing \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\" as the dead skeletons join them in a dance.\n\nThrough a hole, the carriages then enter Phantom Canyon, which is a twisted, supernatural version of Thunder Mesa. Great rifts in the earth surrounding the vehicles suggest that an earthquake has happened, which reenacts Thunder Mesa's turning point from a prosperous community to a ghost town. An eerie-looking ticket master (an animatronic using the same mold as Ezra, one of the original Hitchhiking Ghosts from the American rides) stands before a ramshackle train station, offering the riders train tickets to the Underworld. Guests then pass a ruined town hall where the mayor (who speaks clips of dialogue from Paul Frees, the original rides' Ghost Host, and who is modeled from the same mold as animatronics of Dreamfinder from the original version of Epcot's Journey into Imagination with Figment) holds the Key to the City and invites guests to be the Manor's 1000th ghost, \"but beware of hitchhiking ghosts!\" As he tips his hat, his head comes with it. A shootout follows between a bank robber fleeing on a mule and a cowardly sheriff, with Big Thunder Mountain in the background behind the sheriff. Guests see a pharmacy where a green-faced pharmacist drinks a potion of some-sort, followed by a saloon whose front wall has caved in. Inside it, there is a dancing showgirl, a bartender and a man playing a honky-tonk piano. Every once in a while, a hand with a candelabra appears out of the piano. Four invisible gambler figures play poker nearby. \n\nMuch of Phantom Canyon was derived from a planned scene of a wild mining town called Dry Gulch in the Western River Expedition at the Magic Kingdom, later retooled into their version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Phantom Canyon occupies a space that in the regular Haunted Mansions is used for the graveyard scene.\n\nAnother cackling figure of the Phantom and his raven stands by a tree with a noose and several empty coffins for awaiting guests, his eyes glowing red at passing riders. Prior to 2019, this animatronic version of the Phantom was a skeleton with rotting flesh on his body, showing the guests that he has lost any humanity he's ever had left in him. As they see the silhouette of the Manor ahead, they enter the mausoleum, where Melanie's four suitors were buried. Prior to 2019, guests would encounter Melanie's floating skeleton pointing the way out. The vehicles enter a subterranean chamber lined with large, gilt-framed mirrors in which the ghostly image of Melanie, driven insane by the loss of her suitors and groom, appears in the vehicles, beckoning riders to wed her. Vehicles travel through a wine cellar, where cast members await to help them disembark their carriages and they walk toward the exit.\n\nAs guests travel towards day light, the evil laughter of the Phantom can be heard, as well as Melanie's voice, telling guests to \"hurry back\" and to \"bring their death certificates\". Prior to 2019, a small Melanie would beckon guests to hurry back. Finally, guests exit into Boot Hill, a Cemetery filled with humorous gravestones, as well as ride-oriented gravestones for the Ravenswoods and several others. If one should turn around to look back at the house, they can see the Phantom looking out the window over the exit and down at them, before he closes the curtains. It is easier to see him at night, since there is a light shining behind him. In the Cemetery, one can hear Melanie's beating heart in her tomb, both a reference to the original Haunted Mansion bride, whose red beating heart could be seen through her chest and Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ideal for the sporty, energetic, sociable, independent and lovely child.\"\n\nIt was opened on 29 September 1865 as a boys' school 'to provide a sound and plain education, on the principles of the Church of England, and on the public school system, for the sons of farmers and others engaged in commercial pursuits'. It grew rapidly and by the 1880s had more than 300 pupils although, as with many similar schools, it declined over the next 30 years and in 1910 numbers dropped to 150. Two powerful headmasters - Herbert Rhodes and David Loveday restored Cranleigh's fortunes.\n\nCranleigh started to admit girls in the early 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1999. The current headmaster is Martin Reader with former East Housemaster, Simon Bird, as the Deputy Head.\n\nThe school's Trevor Abbott Sports Centre was opened by Sir Richard Branson and the West House was opened by Baroness Greenfield. New building projects include the recently completed extension onto Cubitt House as well as an environmentally friendly Woodland Workshop and a new £10 million Academic Centre named the Emms Centre. Named after David Emms, this was opened by Lord Patten of Barnes in 2009. The building includes new facilities for Science and Modern Languages as well as a lecture theatre. A £2 million renovation of the chapel in 2009 included the installation of a £500,000 Mander organ.\n\nThe school is especially recognised for its quality of output in both the arts and sport. In a 2015 survey, it was rated as the third best sporting school in the UK, with further success coming in the form of being one of the only schools to win the Rosslyn Park National Sevens Tournament consecutively, in both 2016 and 2017.\n\n\n\nFormer pupils of the school may join the Old Cranleighan Society. About 6,500 past pupils are currently members. The Old Cranleighan Sports Club in Thames Ditton in Surrey is owned by the Society.\n\nThe thirty seventh steam locomotive (Engine 936) in the Southern Railway's Class V, built in 1934 was named \"Cranleigh\" after the school. This class of locomotive was known as the Schools Class because all 40 of the class were named after English public schools.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188382", "title": "Schistosoma japonicum", "text": "Schistosoma japonicum\n\nSchistosoma japonicum is an important parasite and one of the major infectious agents of schistosomiasis.This parasite has a very wide host range, infecting at least 31 species of wild mammals, including 9 carnivores, 16 rodents, one primate (Human), two insectivores and three artiodactyls and therefore it can be considered a true zoonosis. Travelers should be well-aware of where this parasite might be a problem and how to prevent the infection. S. japonicum occurs in the Far East, such as China, the Philippines, Indonesia and Southeast Asia. (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/epi.html)\n\n\"Schistosoma. japonicum was discovered in Kofu basin by Dr. Fujiro Katsurada. Schistosoma Japonica develops in not only humans but also in the other mammals. Hence in one of the epidemic areas in Japan, Kofu basin, farming cattle and the other mammals tend to have edema bloating. Dr. Fujiro Katsurada, a pathologist in Okayama University, focused on this point. In July 30 in 1904, Katsurarda took a house cat lived in Kofu basin and vivisected. Then, Katsurada discovered 24 males and 8 females (5 of them disputed) of new parasites. Later, Katsurada named the parasite as Schistosoma japonicum.\n\nIndividuals at risk to infection from \"S. japonicum\" are farmers who often wade in their irrigation water, fishermen who wade in streams and lakes, children who play in water, and people who wash clothes in streams.\n\nAblution is a religious requirement in some Muslim countries to achieve cleanliness by washing of the anal or urethral orifices after urination or defecation. However, this act leads to the transmission of schistosomiasis. The water source typically used for ablution is a contaminated river or canal from previously deposited human waste, thus furthering the contamination in the population.\n\nImportant factors to influence transmission are age, sex of an individual, as well as the economic and educational level of a population. Males show the highest rates of infection, as well as the most intense infections. This may be due to occupational risk. As was the case of Suriname, the highest prevalence occurs in both sexes where both male and females work in fields.\n\nClimate change may have potential impact on the transmission of schistosomiasis in China. The development of \"S. japonicum\" in the intermediate host \"Oncomelania hupensis\" occurred at the threshold of 15.4 °C. Previously, \"O. hupensis\" has been restricted to areas where the mean January temperature has been over 0 °C. With rising climate change, it is predicted that by 2050, \"O. hupensis\" will be able to cover 8.1% of the surface area of China, thus leading to greater concern to new populations being at risk to schistosomiasis.\n\nThe \"S. japonicum\" worms are yellow or yellow-brown. The males of this species are slightly larger than the other Schistosomes and they measure ~ 1.2 cm by 0.5 mm. The females measure 2 cm by 0.4 mm. The adult worms are longer and narrower than the related \"S. mansoni\" worms.\n\nBy electron microscopy there are no bosses or spines on the dorsal surface of the male, which is ridged and presents a spongy appearance. Many spines cover the inner surface of the oral sucker and extend to the pharyngeal opening. The oral sucker shows a rim with spines of variable size and sharpness inward and outward from the rim. The ventral sucker possesses many spines which are smaller than in the oral sucker. The lining of the gynecophoric canal is roughened by minute spines. The integument of the female is ridged and pitted and possesses fewer spines than in the oral sucker, the ventral sucker, and the gynecophoric canal of the male. Anterior to the acetabulum, the integumental surfaces are devoid of spines. However, in the other areas, spines are equally distributed except for the vicinity of the excretory pore.\n\nThe ova are about 55–85 μm by 40–60 μm, oval with a minute lateral spine or knob.\n\nThe life cycles of \"Schistosoma japonicum\" and \"Schistosoma mansoni\" are very similar. In brief, eggs of the parasite are released in the feces and if they come in contact with water they hatch into free-swimming larva, called miracidia. The larva then has to infect a snail of the genus \"Oncomelania\" such as species of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" within one or two days. Inside the snail, the larva undergo asexual reproduction through a series of stages called sporocysts. After the asexual reproduction stage cercaria (another free-swimming larva) are generated in large quantities, which then leave (shed into the environment) the snail and must infect a suitable vertebrate host. Once the cercaria penetrates the skin of the host it loses its tail and becomes a schistosomule. The worms then migrate through the circulation ending at the mesenteric veins where they mate and start laying eggs. Each pair deposits around 1500–3500 eggs per day in the vessels of the intestinal wall. The eggs infiltrate through the tissues and are passed in the feces. <Clarification & citation needed>\n\nOnce the parasite has entered the body and begun to produce eggs, it uses the hosts' immune system (granulomas) for transportation of eggs into the gut. The eggs stimulate formation of granuloma around them. The granulomas, consisting of motile cells, carry the eggs to the intestinal lumen. When in the lumen, granuloma cells disperse leaving the eggs to be excreted within feces. Unfortunately, about two-thirds of eggs are not excreted, instead they build up in the gut. Chronic infection can lead to characteristic Symmer's fibrosis (also known as \"clay pipe stem\" fibroses, these occur due to intrahepatic portal vein calcification which assume the shape of a clay pipe in cross section). \"S. japonicum\" is the most pathogenic of the schistosoma species because it produces up to 3,000 eggs per day, ten times greater than that of \"S. mansoni.\".\n\nAs a chronic disease, \"S. japonicum\" can lead to Katayama fever, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, liver portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and ascites. Some eggs may pass the liver and enter lungs, nervous system and other organs where they can adversely affect the health of the infected individual.\n\n\"Schistosoma japonicum\" is the only human blood fluke that occurs in China, Philippines, Sri Lanka Asia and Lindu Lake (found by Markus Kleemann in a Rainforest Lake). It is the cause of schistosomiasis japonica, a disease that still remains a significant health problem especially in lake and marshland regions. Schistosomiasis is an infection caused mainly by three schistosome species; \"Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum\" and \"Schistosoma haematobium. S. japonicum\" being the most infectious of the three species. Infection by schistosomes is followed by an acute Katayama fever. Historical accounts of Katayama disease dates back to the discovery of \"S. Japonicum\" in Japan in 1904. The disease was named after an area it was endemic to, Katayama district, Hiroshima, Japan. If left untreated, it will develop into a chronic condition characterized by hepatosplenic disease and impaired physical and cognitive development. The severity of \"S. japonicum\" arises in 60% of all neurological diseases in schistosomes due to the migration of schistosome eggs to the brain. Symptoms an infected person might experience include: fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly and eosinophilia. (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/biology.html)\n\nMicroscopic identification of eggs in stool or urine is the most practical method for diagnosis. Stool examination should be performed when infection with \"S. mansoni\" or \"S. japonicum\" is suspected, and urine examination should be performed if \"S. haematobium\" is suspected.\n\nEggs can be present in the stool in infections with all Schistosoma species. The examination can be performed on a simple smear (1 to 2 mg of fecal material). Since eggs may be passed intermittently or in small amounts, their detection will be enhanced by repeated examinations and/or concentration procedures (such as the formalin - ethyl acetate technique). In addition, for field surveys and investigational purposes, the egg output can be quantified by using the Kato-Katz technique (20 to 50 mg of fecal material) or the Ritchie technique.\n\nEggs can be found in the urine in infections with \"S. haematobium\" (recommended time for collection: between noon and 3 PM) and with \"S. japonicum\". Detection will be enhanced by centrifugation and examination of the sediment. Quantification is possible by using filtration through a Nucleopore membrane of a standard volume of urine followed by egg counts on the membrane. Tissue biopsy (rectal biopsy for all species and biopsy of the bladder for \"S. haematobium\") may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative.\n\nSince the eggs of \"S. japonicum\" are small, concentration techniques may be required. Biopsies are mostly performed to test for chronic schistomiasis with no eggs. \nAn ELISA test can be performed to test for antibodies specific to schistosomes. A positive result indicates a present or recent infection (within the past two years). Ultrasonographic examination can be performed to assess the extent of hepatic and spleen-related morbidity. The problems with immunodiagnostic methods are that 1) It is only positive a certain time after infection 2) They can cross interact with other helminthes infections.\n\nThe therapy of choice is praziquantel, a quinolone derivative. Praziquantel is generally administered in an oral form in one or two doses from 40–60 mg/kg body weight.\n\nCombination treatment may prevent morbidity due to schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is most active against adult worms. However, it has been found that artemether prevents the development of adult worms, thus decreasing egg production in the host. If both praziquantel and artemether can be used together, the entire lifespan of \"S. japonicum\" would be covered in the vertebrate host.\n\nHuman waste should be hygienically disposed of. Human waste in water with the \"Oncomelania\" snail intermediate host is a major cause to the perpetuation of schistosomiasis. To prevent this from occurring, human waste should never be used for nightsoiling (fertilization of crops with human waste) and unsanitary conditions should be improved. To avoid infection, individuals should avoid contact with water (including swimming and walking through water) that is contaminated by human or animal waste, especially water sources that are endemic to \"Oncomelania\" snails.\n\nOther important prevention techniques include: drinking purchased mineral water from stores and boiling water on high temperature for at least one minute before it would be used for drinking or bathing. It is important to notice, that iodine treatment does not guarantee the safety of the water. (https://www.cdc.gov/parasite/schistosomiasis/prevent.html)\n\nIf necessary to enter potentially infected water, cercarial repellants and cercaricidal ointments can be applied to the skin before entering the water. Barrier cream with a dimethicone base offered high levels of protection for at least 48 hours.\n\nThe search for a practical vaccine continues and could greatly benefit affected areas.\n\nControl against infection of \"S. japonicum\" requires multiple efforts consisting of education, eliminating the disease from infected individuals, controlling the vector.\n\nEducation can be highly effective, but difficult with lack of resources. Also, asking people to change customs, traditions and behaviors can prove a difficult task.\n\nControlling \"S. japonicum\" with molluscicide has proved ineffective because \"Oncomelania\" snails are amphibious and only frequent water to lay their eggs.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188384", "title": "Joseph Towne", "text": "Joseph Towne\n\nJoseph Towne (25 November 1806 – 25 June 1879) was a British moulageur, sculptor, and stereoscopist. He is best known for the creation of anatomical models made of wax, many of which still survive today and are on display in the Guy's Hospital medical school museum.\n\nJoseph Towne was born in Royston, Hertfordshire, where his father was a preacher at the local chapel, the youngest of five surviving children. He was apprenticed to a local artist, spending two years as an assistant sculptor.\n\nWhen he was seventeen, Joseph Towne began work on a major project, the construction of a wax skeleton, even though he had never seen a real one. Working from books, he wanted to be accurate. He had been informed that there was a Society of Arts competition in London, so he decided to go to London where he visited doctors who examined it, but could not tell him whether it was correct. Advised to ask Astley Cooper, in April 1825, Towne met the surgeon, who wrote out a note for him:\nHis skeleton took second place. In the following year, a wax sculpture of a head dissection made for John Hilton won the first prize. Cooper at Guy's Hospital seems to have intended to create a collection of wax medical models, because in 1825 he took Towne onto the staff.\nTowne worked for the anatomist Dr. Hilton and for Addison. Addison taught materia medica, and had need for wax moulages of diseases. Smallpox is contagious, so the students would be shown wax models rather than the real thing. Towne made eight moulages of variola, the smallpox - six days before eruption, five days, four days, three days, two days, the day before, the day of eruption and two days after. He also made three moulages of vaccinia, the cowpox.\n\nTowne had an assistant and an Italian model known as Francis - who was most probably Francesco. In the manner of a dental assistant, Towne's helper would mix up portions of plaster-of-paris for Towne to apply to the limb of Francis.\nLater, he would fit end-caps as needed and fill the mold with wax. Finally, the wax molding would be painted with colored wax.\n\nTowne was paid a huge retainer, as well as a large sum for each moulage. Consequently, he remained loyal to Guy's hospital. Additional work involved the making of a marble bust of Cooper - who was now Sir Astley Cooper - and of other members of staff.\n\nIn 1852, he made \"The magnificent bust by Towne\" that was mentioned by Sir Samuel Wilks and Dr. Daldy in their \"Collected Works of Thomas Addison\".\n\nIn 1859, the medical school at Guy's fell on hard times. It was suggested that the hospital museum should be closed to save money. That would automatically have spelled the end of Towne's career. Fortunately, the museum with its wax models continued - but in reduced circumstances. Ever loyal, Towne refused to make models for other British hospitals. His fame had spread, however, so that he made about two hundred additional moulages for faraway places such as India and the United States.\n\nProfessor Charles Wheatstone had invented stereoscopy, and revealed it to the world in 1838. There was no serious prior art. Victorians immediately took to the novelty, and Towne was no exception. As one might expect, he assembled a collection of 3D images of sculptures to study. He also studied the work of Wheatstone and of Sir David Brewster.\n\nIn 1862, Towne published the results of his stereoscopic researches together with a reply to the man who was now Sir Charles Wheatstone. But ever loyal to Guy's, he published in Guy's Hospital Reports.\nThe articles, in two parts, provide a fascinating insight into the mind of Joseph Towne. For example, he argues that if one eye sees yellow and the other sees blue, the mind should see green. This is wrong. The yellow and blue that he speaks of are pigments. It is now known that when yellow and blue light are mixed, the outcome is white. But what if yellow enters the mind via one eye, and blue via the other? Such binocular colour rivalry remained uncharted territory for long. Similarly, Towne argues that one can see in three dimensions with only one eye. This is because one can sense the tension in the eye-muscles as one focuses close. However, it is not true shape-perception as defined by Wheatstone.\n\nTowne's \"adjustive Stereoscope\" is no more than a direct-viewing aid with a septum and pinhole oculars. However, it does help anybody who is attempting direct-viewing because the septum cuts out distraction whilst the pinholes extend the depth-of-field.\n\nOver the course of his career, Towne made just over a thousand moulages for Guy's hospital, eight hundred under the direction of Addison including cases of skin disease, and anatomical preparations from dissections made by John Hilton. He also made an equestrian statue of the Duke of Kent for Buckingham Palace.\n\nHe was buried in West Norwood Cemetery, where his monument has been destroyed.\n\n"}
{"id": "2188387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188387", "title": "BMT Fourth Avenue Line", "text": "BMT Fourth Avenue Line\n\nThe BMT Fourth Avenue Line is a rapid transit line of the New York City Subway, mainly running under Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn. The line is served by the D, N, and R at all times, and a few rush-hour W trains. The R and W run local while the D and N run express at all times except late nights, when they run local. The line was originally built by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) and is now internally operated as part of the New York City Subway's B Division.\n\nThe fully underground line starts as a two-track line in Downtown Brooklyn west of Court Street, connecting to the BMT Broadway Line and BMT Nassau Street Line in Manhattan via the Montague Street Tunnel under the East River. It travels east under Montague and Willoughby Streets to DeKalb Avenue, where it then turns southeast under Flatbush Avenue. At DeKalb Avenue, the express tracks, which continue from the Manhattan Bridge to the northwest, split off from the BMT Brighton Line and join the Fourth Avenue Line. At Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center, the line curves southwest under Fourth Avenue to the end of the line at Bay Ridge–95th Street. Going south from Atlantic Avenue, the BMT West End Line splits from both the local and express tracks south of 36th Street, while the express tracks continue as the BMT Sea Beach Line south of 59th Street.\n\nFourth Avenue never had a streetcar line or elevated railway due to the provisions of the assessment charged to neighboring property owners when the street was widened. Construction of the line was only undertaken because of the efforts of the local communities. After the line was opened, development resulting from the line's construction transformed communities such as Dyker Heights, Fort Hamilton, Bay Ridge, and Sunset Park. One station, Myrtle Avenue, was abandoned in 1956 as part of the reconfiguration of the busy DeKalb Avenue Junction.\n\nComing south from DeKalb Avenue and off of Fulton Street, the four-track line runs entirely under Fourth Avenue to just past 59th Street. South of 36th Street, the West End Line, formerly the New Utrecht Avenue elevated line, branches off eastwards, running to its terminus at Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. Until 1954, the BMT Culver Line also branched off from here, replaced by the Culver Shuttle until 1975, when it was discontinued. At 64th Street, after the Sea Beach Line branches off eastwards towards Coney Island via an open-cut right-of-way, the line becomes two-tracked and continues under Fourth Avenue to its terminus at Bay Ridge–95th Street. Between 86th Street and 95th Street there is a third track available for train storage. While this section of the line was built with two tracks, there are provisions to add two additional express tracks between 59th and 85th Streets if the need ever arises.\n\nThe line's northernmost section serves Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn. The central section serves Park Slope east of Fourth Avenue and north of Prospect Expressway; Boerum Hill and Gowanus west of Fourth Avenue and north of Prospect Expressway; and Sunset Park to the south of Prospect Expressway. The southernmost section serves the communities of Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton.\nThe following services use the Fourth Avenue Line:\nThe line normally carries the Fourth Avenue service on the local tracks and the Sea Beach and West End services on the express tracks. During weekdays, three local N trains per day, in each direction, are designated as . Manhattan-bound from DeKalb Avenue, the local tracks run via the Montague Street Tunnel to Lower Manhattan, serving either Whitehall Street on the BMT Broadway Line (N, R) or Broad Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line (no service; the last service to use these tracks was the , rerouted in 2010). The express tracks go to Manhattan via the Manhattan Bridge to either the BMT Broadway Line's Canal Street express station (N) or the IND Sixth Avenue Line's Grand Street station (D).\n\nTransportation to the area was first provided in 1889 with the establishment of the 39th Street Ferry, which connected the area to Manhattan. Between 1888 and 1893, a new elevated line was opened along Fifth Avenue. Initially, the line terminated at 27th Street where people could transfer to horse cars. In 1892, the first trolley line was built in Brooklyn, starting at the ferry and running via Second Avenue to 65th Street, and then via Third Avenue. The Fifth Avenue Elevated was then extended to Third Avenue and 65th Street.\n\nA building boom in South Brooklyn started in about 1902 and 1903. Thousands of people started coming to the area from Manhattan and from other places. In 1905 and 1906 realty values increased by about 100 percent, and land values increased. This growth was spurred by the promise of improved transportation access. The improved transportation access transformed the community from an isolated farm community to a center of industrial and commercial life.\n\nThe Fourth Avenue Line was built as part of the Dual Contracts. It replaced the parallel elements of an old, now long-ago-demolished elevated system running above Fifth Avenue and Third Avenue. In 1902, a committee of the West End Board of Trade announced their support for a subway line from the Battery to Coney Island via Atlantic or Hamilton Avenues in front of the Rapid Transit Commission. The first definite plans for a subway under Fourth Avenue were proposed by Rapid Transit Commission engineer William Barclay Parsons in 1903. On April 10, 1905, a citizens' committee was created to aid the creation of the subway line.\n\nIn 1906, the plan for the Fourth Avenue subway included a spur via 86th Street running through Dyker Heights and Bensonhurst. At this time the spur was not authorized, but at the time it was viewed as a necessary part of the transportation plan for the area. The line was planned as a four-track line from Dean Street to Fort Hamilton, before being fed by a subway line going under the East River, and by a line over the Manhattan Bridge. An additional two-track spur was to begin at 37th Street before running under private property and 38th Street, before connecting with the South Brooklyn Railway. An additional two-track spur would branch off between 63rd and 64th Streets before connecting with the Sea Beach Railway. South of 65th Street the main line was planned to continue as a four-track line to 100th Street. Another proposal for a branch line was for a subway via New Utrecht Avenue. The line, consisting of four tracks, would have branched off at 40th Street before turning under New Utrecht Avenue and 86th Street to a point between 23rd and 24th Avenues. From there the line would have become an elevated line running to Coney Island. A spur of the Fourth Avenue line via 86th Street would have merged in here.\n\nAs a possible alternative to subway construction, engineer F. H. Behr proposed a monorail system for Brooklyn. Each car was proposed to carry 80 to 120 passengers and attain a speed of . An application was filed with the Board of Alderman for franchises for four routes, with the first running to South Brooklyn. It would have run from the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue and down Fourth Avenue to 85th or 86th Streets, where it would turn eastward to Stillwell Avenue, where it would turn onto West 12th Street and continue to a terminal loop at Coney Island.\n\nOn June 1, 1905, the Rapid Transit Commission adopted the Fourth Avenue route to Fort Hamilton. The proposal, on July 7, 1905, was presented to the Board of Estimate, and was approved by them on July 14. The Mayor signed the bill on July 28. On June 18, 1906, the route was approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route. This plan included a connection between the line and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)'s extension into Brooklyn which was then planned to run under Flatbush Avenue. A track connection was also planned to another proposed route: this route would have run under Pacific Street, Court Street, and Montague Street, before running under the East River to Manhattan. That route was never built, but provisions were built for it in the south wall of the Montague Street Tunnel south of the Whitehall Street station.\n\nOn December 7, 1906, the Board of Estimate recommended that two bids be let: one for the construction of the line, and one for the construction, equipment, and operation of the line. A spur to Coney Island was added to the plan after the persistency of Frank Hudson. On May 31, 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission requested that the Board of Estimate rescind the above resolution so that bids of construction alone might be asked for, and it authorized the preparation of the plans and contracts. On June 4, 1907, a resolution was passed by the Board of Estimate that authorized the Rapid Transit Commission that rescinded the resolution and authorized the Rapid Transit Commission to let out bids of construction only. On June 27, 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission approved the plans and contracts with the exception of the section between Ashland Place and Fulton Street to Sackett Street and Fourth Avenue. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the Public Service Commission (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the new commission hesitated to approve the plan for the line. People in South Brooklyn were angered by the delay, and 3,000 people from the area showed up to a meeting on September 11, 1907, urging the PSC to act. In October and November 1907, the PSC approved the plans and contracts with modifications concerning grades and an increase in the height of the subway to fifteen feet. \n\nThe commissioners, from the PSC, adopted plans for the line on March 10, 1908, and proposed contracts for the line. On March 20, 1908, at a meeting of the Board of Estimate, Controller Metz sent the plan to a committee within the Board for study, angering five hundred supporters of the line at the meeting. Coler, the Brooklyn Borough President, objected to the committee, citing that Mr. Lewis, the Chief Engineer, was against the construction of the project. This resolution was defeated, and the main resolution failed to get a two-thirds majority. Afterwards, Metz procured an injunction that restrained the Board from acting until the debt limit was established: this blocked any immediate action. After hearings, General Tracy announced that the project was $150,000,000 within the debt limit, and Mayor George McClellan and Controller Metz joined with their colleagues to vote unanimously in favor of the Fourth Avenue subway line on March 27, 1908.\n\nIn 1908, detailed plans were created by the PSC. The plan was changed to not have the line run via IRT trackage. In having it run via its own trackage, the line could be operated by railroads other than the IRT as standard 10 foot-wide railroad cars could fit through the tunnels. To connect to Manhattan without using IRT trackage the line would use part of contracts given for other lines. The line would use the Manhattan Bridge–Revised route, which was approved in 1909 and was originally conceived to connect the IRT Brooklyn Line at Flatbush Avenue, east of the Nevins Street station, to the Canal Street Subway and the proposed Third Avenue Subway going both north and south under the Bowery. The tracks would have used both the north and south tracks on the Manhattan Bridge.\n\nContracts were awarded on May 22, 1908 for the section between 43rd Street and the Manhattan Bridge, but the Board of Estimate did not approve them until a taxpayer's lawsuit regarding the city's debt was settled. They were approved on October 29, 1909. During the time between the award and approval of the contracts, a non-partisan political body, with the backing of 25,000 South Brooklyn residents, was created that would only support candidates in the municipal election that pledged support for the Fourth Avenue subway.\n\nGroundbreaking for the first section of the subway, between DeKalb Avenue and 43rd Street (ending at 36th Street), took place on November 13, 1909 at DeKalb Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, after the plans and surveys for the line were completed. This section was completed in 1916. In June 1911, more than 70 percent of the excavation was completed. The line did not have to be excavated through tough bedrock like in Manhattan; in fact, there was not much difficulty, owing to the fact that Brooklyn soil is sandy. The construction of the first portion of the line was broken up into six sections. The construction of the line was expected to transform communities in South Brooklyn, such as Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Fort Hamilton, Bath Beach, and Coney Island.\n\nConstruction on the section between 27th Street and 43rd Street, Route 11A4, began on December 10, 1909, and it was completed in October 1912. Construction began on Route 11A3, the section between 10th Street and 27th Street, on December 20, 1909. It was completed in May 1912. The section between 10th Street and Sackett Street, Route 11A2, had construction started on it on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. Four days after the construction of that segment began, construction began on the segment under Ashland Place and under Fourth Avenue between Fulton Street and Sackett Street. Known as Route 11A1 and 11E1, it was completed in 1915. On March 18, 1910, construction began on the four tracks over the Manhattan Bridge. It was completed in September 1912.\n\nNot long after the contracts were awarded, the PSC started negotiating with the BRT and the IRT in the execution of the Dual Contracts. A lease to the Fourth Avenue subway was given to the New York Municipal Railway Corporation, a subsidiary of the BRT, for forty-nine years as part of Contract 4. The Dual Contracts were signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway was recommended as part of the Dual System, and this recommendation was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its Chief Engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912, and the contracts for the extension, Route 11B, was awarded on September 16, 1912. Later on, the plan for the extension was modified to include a connection with the Sea Beach Railroad between 64th and 65th Streets.\n\nConstruction on the southernmost section of the line to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, began in late October 1912. The lower section of the line was constructed along with several branch lines, which replaced former surface railroads. These lines are the BMT West End Line splitting south of 36th Street, and the BMT Sea Beach Line leaving south of 59th Street. In anticipation of the opening of the subway, several housing and development booms occurred along Fourth Avenue, particularly in Bay Ridge. On January 24, 1913, construction begun on Route 11B2, the section between 61st Street and 89th Street. This section was built as a two-track structure under the west side of Fourth Avenue with plans for two future tracks on the east side of the street. The bridge across the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch, but under Fourth Avenue, was built for four tracks, but only the space for the two west tracks were ever used. The 86th Street station was designed for eventual conversion into a four-track, two island platform express station. If the two additional tracks were built, the east platform on all local stops south of 59th Street would be removed. Construction was completed on this section in 1915. On March 15, 1913, construction began on Route 11B1, the section between 43rd Street and 61st Street. Originally, this section was planned to have two tracks, but after the connection to the Sea Beach Line was added to the plan during the middle of construction, the plan was changed to four tracks. This section was completed in 1915.\n\nThe dimensions of the Fourth Avenue Line are different than those of the original subway opened by the IRT in 1904. The height of the roof above the base rail in IRT lines was , while the height is on the Fourth Avenue Line, allowing for the possible operation of larger subway cars. Precautions were taken to keep out water, as evidenced by the placement of waterproofing under the floor, along the sides, and over the roof of the tunnel. This was expected to make the subway cooler in hot weather than the original subway. Partitions were created in between the tracks to allow for improved ventilation, and to allow for the safety of employees, niches were provided in the partitions. All of the platforms, both express and local, were built to be straight to avoid the inconvenience of curved platforms. The local stations were originally , while the express stations were originally long, allowing for eight-car expresses and six-car locals. The stations were all finished in white and marble tile; each station had its own color scheme to allow for regular passengers to identify their station based only on the color of the marble trimmings.\n\nThe first train to run via the entirety of the line was a test train that operated on June 15, 1915. The trip used the local tracks as the express tracks were not yet completed due to the reconstruction of the DeKalb Avenue station. A trial trip that ran earlier in the day ripped a piece off of the platform at DeKalb Avenue as it was too broad. At this time, the line was scheduled to be inaugurated with a ceremonial trip on June 19, before being opened to the public on June 21. However, the opening was delayed a day to June 22, 1915, when the line opened from the Manhattan Bridge through to the Sea Beach Line. The ceremonial trip took place three days prior. Initially, service only ran via the Nassau Loop tracks to Chambers Street as the new subway under Broadway was not yet open. Construction on the initial portion of the line cost about $30 million. The opening of the line reduced congestion on the elevated lines operating over the Brooklyn Bridge, and on the Original Subway, though to a lesser extent.\n\nPrior to the line's opening, the line was expected to not be open until around July 4 due to problems with the signaling system. One major change to the line's construction was completed: the conversion of DeKalb Avenue to an express station. Originally, DeKalb Avenue was going to be a local station. However, during the middle of construction, it was changed to an express station and track crossovers had to be installed. The reasoning for this is due to changes required by the Dual Contracts. An additional line, the Whitehall–Montague Street route, was to be built connecting the Broadway Line in Manhattan and the Fourth Avenue subway under the Flatbush Avenue Extension to the west of the DeKalb Avenue station. By making the station express, express trains that would be operated through the Montague Street line could stop at the station. Crossovers connecting the express and local tracks would allow for this. Construction continued even after the line opened, necessitating that service only use the line's local tracks for a few weeks. One other change was required during the middle of construction. As part of the original plan the connection to the West End Line was to be at 40th Street. However, the connection had to be moved to 38th Street to obey the requirements of Contract 4, and the already completed connection had to be changed. To do so, the 36th Street station had to be partially reconstructed. Work was almost completely finished in June 1915. \n\nThe 45th and 53rd Street stations initially remained closed, despite being technically complete, since the stations were being used by a contractor to haul dirt out. The stations opened on September 22, 1915.\n\nThe line opened from 59th Street to 86th Street on January 15, 1916. Trains from 86th Street ran to Chambers Street in Manhattan via the Fourth Avenue Line local tracks. On this date, the express tracks opened for service, with Sea Beach Line trains running express between 59th Street and Chambers Street at all times except late nights, when they ran local.\n\nEven though the contract was approved for the Montague Street Tunnel, and the subway line connecting to it, in 1916, it was decided to add an infill station at Lawrence Street and Willoughby Street. In 1917, the original contract was modified and a provision for the station was added. Work started in October 1917, but construction halted on May 18, 1918, because of a wartime shortage of materials and men due to World War I, and about half the station was completed. Service running through the Montague Tunnel and this station began on August 1, 1920, while the station was being construction alongside in-service trains. The line was called the Montague Street Tunnel Line.\n\nConstruction resumed on May 18, 1922, and entailed the construction of an island platform between the two cast iron-lined tunnels, a mezzanine, and a station entrance, which required excavation from the street. On June 11, 1924, the Lawrence Street station opened with the Lawrence Street entrances; the Bridge Street entrances opened later. A special train to Prospect Park operated for the station's opening. A unique feature at the west end of the station was a folding platform edge that was necessary to clear a crossover switch that was partially underneath the platform.\n\nOn August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, Robert Ridgeway, to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to Staten Island through a tunnel under The Narrows. On September 12, 1922, a meeting was held by the Transit Commission to determine whether a stop at 91st Street should be included as part of the planned extension. Ultimately, no station was built at 91st Street. At the meeting it was decided that money for an additional station in between 86th Street and the new terminal at 95th Street would be better spent on an extensive terminal with entrances at 93rd, 94th, and 95th Streets. On November 15, 1922, a report by the Chief Engineer recommended changing the plans of the Fourth Avenue Extension to provide for a third track between the 86th Street and 95th Street stations for train storage. The change was approved by the Transit Commission on November 22. Other extensions were also planned in 1922: a branch of the line running via 86th Street to 18th Avenue to connect with the New Utrecht Line to Coney Island, Route 19, and the future Tenth Avenue subway, and a branch of the line at 67th Street heading to Staten Island, Route 20.\n\nOn December 28, 1922, the Transit Commission announced that it had awarded the contract for the construction of a half-mile extension of the Fourth Avenue Line, Contract 11B, to T. A. Gillespie Company for $1.5 million. However, as the Board of Estimate failed to take action upon it, the contractor withdrew its bid on March 7, 1923. The Transit Commission blamed the Board of Estimate for delays in the awarding of the contract; the Commission said that the city would suffer a substantial loss due to increased construction costs, and because the contract that was given was \"highly advantageous to the city.\" As part of Contract 11B, the extension was built with two tracks, with the exception of a short three-track stretch just north of the terminal at 95th Street. The extension was to be built with a provision to extend the line to Staten Island. As a result of a motion made by Commissioner LeRoy Harkness in front of the Transit Commission, the contract was set to be put back up for bid. On November 2, 1923, the Board of Estimate approved the contract for the line with T. A. Gillespie Company, the same contractor that had bid on the project earlier, but withdrew. The Transit Commission, due to the delay of the project, gave orders on November 3 to speed up the completion of the project. Construction began on December 17, 1923.\n\nOn February 16, 1925, the Board of Transportation directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at twelve stations along the Fourth Avenue Line (Myrtle Avenue, DeKalb Avenue, Pacific Street, Union Street, Ninth Street, Prospect Avenue, 25th Street, 45th Street, 53rd Street, Bay Ridge Avenue, 77th Street, and 86th Street) to accommodate eight-car trains at the cost of $633,000. Later that month, on February 28, the Board made public the bids for the contract to complete the 95th Street terminal station. The station, as part of the contract, was built with two tracks, and was built to be 530 feet long to accommodate eight-car trains. A signal and switch tower, and a dispatcher's office was also built at the station. On April 22, 1925, it was announced that $200,000 had been appropriated by the BMT to pay for signal equipment, station control and lighting, drainage and ventilating equipment, and for telephone cables. The final extension to 95th Street, Route 18, opened on October 31, 1925. The platform extensions at the twelve Fourth Avenue Line stations, meanwhile, opened on August 1, 1927.\n\nThe line was planned to be connected via one of two tunnels to Staten Island and to Staten Island Rapid Transit. The first would be in Bay Ridge, south of the 59th Street station, connecting to both SIRT branches near the Tompkinsville station. The other would have been south of 95th Street in Fort Hamilton, following the current routing of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Construction on the first plan, known as the Staten Island Tunnel was started in 1923 but soon halted. Later proposals called for connecting the line and the SIRT via the Verrazano Bridge, though the bridge was built with no railroad provisions. The SIRT ordered new train cars, the ME-1s, that were built to be compatible with operation over the BMT system, and as such, they strongly resembled the BMT's AB Standard.\n\nThe DeKalb Avenue Junction is located to the north and south of the DeKalb Avenue station, and it is located at the juncture of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line on the south and the four Manhattan Bridge tracks and Montague Tunnel tracks on the north. In 1927, platform extensions were built at DeKalb Avenue in order to allow for longer trains. The extensions were built into a curve south of the station–they were closed in 1960 when they were replaced by straight extensions to the north. DeKalb Avenue received a new mezzanine with escalators at the north end of the station. From this mezzanine exits were built on both side of the Flatbush Avenue Extension between Fleet Street and Willoughby Street.\n\nUntil the mid-1950s, though, the extreme outside tracks in each direction hosted the Fourth Avenue Line local tracks and the next pair hosted the Brighton Line. The middle tracks, which bypassed the station, hosted the Fourth Avenue express tracks. A group of level crossovers at the northern end of the station allowed all tracks access to both sides of the Manhattan Bridge and to the Montague Street Tunnel. The Fourth Avenue local tracks led straight onto the Manhattan Bridge west of the station, while the Brighton line tracks led straight to the Montague Street Tunnel, so the crossovers allowed trains from both lines to switch between the bridge and the tunnel. This led to so many train delays on the Fourth Avenue and Brighton Lines that, in 1952, the junction was earmarked for \"top priority\" reconstruction.\n\nDuring the reconstruction of the junction that started in 1956 and was completed by April 1961, the Brighton Line tracks were connected to the DeKalb Avenue station's outermost tracks. A diamond crossover north of the station had caused frequent bottlenecks, but was removed during the realignment and replaced with two flying junctions. All switches immediately north of the station were eliminated. The junction towards the Manhattan Bridge was rebuilt. To make room for a new flying junction, the Myrtle Avenue station was closed on July 16, 1956. That station's northbound platform remains visible from passing trains, but the southbound platform was demolished to accommodate the new flying junction that replaced the diamond crossover. Between 1957 and 1958, extra tracks and new switches were added south of DeKalb Avenue. Platforms were also doubled in length to accommodate ten-car trains of cars. It was estimated that the reconstruction of the junction increased the junction's train capacity by 25%. The Chrystie Street Connection project was also tied to this improvement, as it resulted in more trains using the bridge, as well as connecting trains to the IND Sixth Avenue Line (and thus, to IND lines to the Bronx and Queens).\n\nOn October 25, 1962, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. requested that the New York City Board of Estimate approve an expenditure of $724,572 for the reconstruction of subway structures and entrances along the Fourth Avenue Line in order to accommodate the widening of Fourth Avenue between 60th Street and Atlantic Avenue, which was to be accomplished by narrowing the street's sidewalks. At the time of the request, 80% of the work on the project was completed. Work had started on the project, which cost $1 million, several months earlier. The contract that the Mayor had requested approval for would have relocated vault lights, gratings, entrances and exits at 56th Street and 49th Street, and at the 45th Street, 53rd Street and 59th Street stations.\n\nFormerly, the Fourth Avenue Line served trains from the BMT Culver Line, which connected to the 36th Street station via the lower level of the Ninth Avenue station south of Green-Wood Cemetery from a now-demolished elevated structure. Following the connection of the Culver Line to the South Brooklyn Line of the IND on October 30, 1954, this service turned at Ditmas Avenue instead. Later on, service via the BMT Culver Line was cut back to being a shuttle that ran between Ditmas Avenue and Ninth Avenue. Shuttle service ended in 1975, with homes and housing developments erected over the right-of-way of the two demolished stations in the 1980s and again in the 2010s. The barest stub of the old elevated line is still visible at Ditmas Avenue.\n\nIn January 2017, the MTA revealed plans to rehabilitate the structure of the tunnel above the express tracks between 36th and 59th Streets. The structure had become corroded because resurfacing of Fourth Avenue in the 2010s caused rainwater to seep into the structure rather into the sewage system. Work will also be done between Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center and 36th Streets. Construction started in May 2017, and will end in March 2020. As a result, starting July 30, 2018, N trains ran local along that section at all times. On July 29, 2019, N trains resumed running express in this section.\n\nUnder the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan's Enhanced Station Initiative, three stations on the line—Prospect Avenue, 53rd Street, and Bay Ridge Avenue—were selected to undergo a complete overhaul. All three stations would be entirely closed for up to 6 months in order to speed up renovations, unlike in previous station renovations conducted by the MTA, where parts of the stations would have been closed and renovated piece-by-piece. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, improved signage, and improved station lighting. From January to May 2016, Grimshaw Architects worked on a design for the stations' renovation, with Arup Group acting as a consultant. The award for Package 1 of the renovations, which covers renovations at the three stations, was awarded on November 30, 2016. The stations were closed on a staggered schedule from March to June 2017 for these renovations, with 53rd Street closing first, followed by Bay Ridge Avenue and Prospect Avenue. They were planned to reopen on a staggered schedule from September to December 2017. 53rd Street reopened first on September 8, followed by Bay Ridge Avenue a month later on October 13. Prospect Avenue, the last of the three stations to be renovated, reopened a month ahead of schedule on November 2, 2017.\n\nThe 2015–2019 Capital Program also called for several stations to be renovated with elevators to bring them into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. , only three stations on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line were ADA-accessible: Jay Street–MetroTech, DeKalb Avenue, and Atlantic–Barclays; all of these stops were in Downtown Brooklyn. The Capital Program would bring ADA-accessibility to at least two additional stations, 59th Street and 86th Street, with possible elevator installations in at least four other stations: Union Street, 36th Street, 77th Street, and Bay Ridge–95th Street.\n\nThe Fourth Avenue Line is chained BMT F.\n"}

It was named in 1849 for Mary Conway, the then 17-year-old niece of James Sevier Conway, the Governor of Arkansas. Mary was the eldest daughter of Dr. John R. Conway, a prominent physician and surveyor, who emigrated to California with his wife and 10 children.\n\nAt the base of the rock formation is a plaque with the following inscription:\n\n\"ROCK MARY\n\n\"May 23, 1849\n\n\"This odd and unusual land feature was named on that date by Lieuts.

Piggybacking on the popularity of the BSD package, Franz Lisp was probably the most widely distributed and used Lisp system of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe name is a pun on composer Franz Liszt.\n\nIt was written specifically to be a host for running the Macsyma computer algebra system on VAX. The project began at the end of 1978, soon after UC Berkeley took delivery of their first VAX 11/780 (named Ernie CoVax, after Ernie Kovacs, the first of many systems with pun names at UCB). Franz Lisp was available free of charge to educational sites, and was also distributed on Eunice, a Berkeley Unix emulator that ran on VAX VMS.\n\nAt the time of Franz Lisp's creation, the Macsyma computer algebra system ran mainly on a DEC PDP-10. This computer's limited address space caused difficulties. Attempted remedies included ports of Maclisp to Multics or Lisp machines, but even if successful, these would only be solutions for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as these machines were costly and uncommon. Franz Lisp was the first example of a framework where large Lisp programs could be run outside the Lisp machines environment; Macsyma was then considered a very large program. After being ported to Franz Lisp, Macsyma was distributed to about 50 sites under a license restricted by MIT's interest in making Macsyma proprietary. The VAX Macsyma that ran on Franz Lisp was called Vaxima. When Symbolics Inc., bought the commercial rights to Macsyma from MIT to sell along with its Lisp machines, it eventually was compelled to sell Macsyma also on DEC VAX and Sun Microsystems computers, paying royalties to the University of California for the use of Franz Lisp.\n\nOther Lisp implementations for the VAX were MIT's NIL (never fully functional), University of Utah's Portable Standard Lisp, DEC's VAX Lisp, Xerox's Interlisp-VAX, and Le Lisp.\n\nIn 1982, the port of Franz Lisp to the Motorola 68000 processor was begun. In particular, it was ported to a prototype Sun-1 made by Sun Microsystems, which ran a variant of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix called SunOS. In 1986, at Purdue University, Franz Lisp was ported to the CCI Power 6/32 platform, code named \"Tahoe\".\n\nThe major contributors to Franz Lisp at UC Berkeley were John K. Foderaro, Keith Sklower, and Kevin Layer.\n\nA company was formed to provide support for Franz Lisp called Franz Inc., by founders Richard Fateman, John Foderaro, Fritz Kunze, Kevin Layer, and Keith Sklower, all associated with UC Berkeley. After that, development and research on Franz Lisp continued for a few years, but the acceptance of Common Lisp greatly reduced the need for Franz Lisp. The first product of Franz Inc. was Franz Lisp running on various Motorola 68000-based workstations. A port of Franz Lisp was even done to VAX VMS for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. However, almost immediately Franz Inc. began work on their implementation of Common Lisp, Allegro Common Lisp.\n\nThe Franz Lisp interpreter was written in C and Franz Lisp. It was bootstrapped solely using the C compiler. The Franz Lisp compiler, written entirely in Franz Lisp, was called Liszt, completing the pun on the name of the composer Franz Liszt.\n\nSome notable features of Franz Lisp were arrays in Lisp interchangeable with arrays in Fortran and a foreign function interface (FFI) which allowed interoperation with other languages at the binary level. Many of the implementation methods were borrowed from Maclisp: bibop memory organization (BIg Bag Of Pages), small integers represented uniquely by pointers to fixed values in fields, and fast arithmetic.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188432", "title": "Trichobilharzia regenti", "text": "Trichobilharzia regenti\n\nTrichobilharzia regenti is a neuropathogenic parasitic flatworm of birds which also causes cercarial dermatitis in humans. The species was originally described in 1998 in the Czech Republic and afterwards it was detected also in other European countries, e.g. Denmark, Germany, France, Iceland, Poland, Switzerland, or Russia, and even in Iran. For its unique neurotropic behaviour in vertebrate hosts, the host-parasite interactions are extensively studied in terms of molecular biology, biochemistry and immunology.\n\nThe life cycle of \"T. regenti\" is analogous to that of human schistosomes. Adult flukes mate in a nasal mucosa of anatid birds (e.g. \"Anas platyrhynchos, Spatula clypeata\" or \"Cairina moschata\") and produce eggs with miracidia which hatch directly in the host tissue and leak outside when the bird is drinking/feeding. Once in water, the miracidia swim using their cilia and actively search for a proper molluscan intermediate host (\"Radix lagotis, Radix labiata,\" \"Radix peregra\"). In the snail, the miracidia develop into a primary sporocyst in which secondary sporocysts are formed and give rise to cercariae later on.\n\nCercariae, infective larvae, exit the snail and penetrate the skin of an avian host. After penetration of the host's skin, they shed the immunogenic surface glycocalyx and transform to schistosomula (subadult stage, sg. schistosomulum). Schistosomula then look for peripheral nerves to use them to get to the spinal cord. Through it they continue their migration to the brain and, finally, the nasal tissue in a bill. Here, they mature, copulate and lay eggs while causing pathology (inflammatory infiltration, haemorrhages).\n\nIf mammals are infected by cercariae (instead of birds), the parasites die in the skin being entrapped by immune response. The clinical manifestation of such infection is known as an neglected allergic disease called cercarial dermatitis (or swimmer's itch). In mice, especially in immunodeficient ones, migration of the parasite to the spinal cord was observed.\n\nA complete life cycle of \"T. regenti\" can be maintained under laboratory conditions using \"Radix lagotis\" and \"Anas platyrhynchos\" f. domestica as intermediate and definitive hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the domestic ducks (\"Anas platyrhynchos\" f. domestica) can also serve as reservoir hosts in aquaculture sites, such as rice fields. To study biology of \"T. regenti\" in mammals, C57BL/6, BALB/c a SCID mouse strains are used as accidental hosts.\n\nWhen cercariae of \"T. regenti\" find either avian or mammalian host, they penetrate its skin. For this purpose, they are equipped with cysteine peptidases present in their excretory/secretory products, which are capable of keratin and collagen degradation. Experiments with laboratory prepared recombinant form of the cysteine peptidase cathepsin B2 of \"T. regenti\" (TrCB2) confirmed its ability to cleave skin proteins (collagen, keratin and elastin).\n\nAfter penetration the skin, cercariae transform to schistosomula and start a migration through the host's body. They avoid penetration into blood capillaries and rather prefer entering peripheral nerves in host's limbs. Schistosomula are found in peripheral nerves of ducks and mice as soon as 1.5 and 1 day post infection (DPI), respectively. In both types of hosts, schistosomula exhibit a high affinity to the central nervous system which they enter \"via\" spinal roots. Based on recent observation by 3D imaging techniques (ultramicroscopy and micro-CT), schistosomula appear to migrate preferably through the white matter of the spinal cord in both birds and mammals.\n\nThe next course of the infection differs in final and accidental hosts. In ducks, schistosomula are observed in synsacral segments of a spinal cord 3 DPI and 7–8 days latter (10–11 DPI) they reach the brain. In their final localisation (the nasal tissue), they occur 13–14 DPI and laying eggs starts 15 DPI. In mice, the first schistosomula are found in a lumbar spinal cord as early as 2 DPI and \"medulla oblongata\" is invaded the day after, but only in some individuals. Most of schistosomula stay localised in the thoracic and cervical spinal cord and only exceptionally migrate to the brain. Neither the presence of worms has been detected in a nasal cavity nor has their maturation been noticed in the nervous tissue. Schistosomula development in mice is suppressed likely due to the host immune response and/or the presence/absence of some essential (nutritional, stimulatory) host factors.\n\nIn vertebrate hosts infected by \"T. regenti\", pathological states might be caused by:\n\nAlthough mice are accidental hosts, most of the studies dealing with the pathological effects of \"T. regenti\" were conducted on this model.\n\nIn the initial phase of the infection, early transformed schistosomula are localised in the skin. Information about pathology in the skin of birds has not been completed yet. In mice, immediate oedema and thickening of the site appear as early as 30 minutes after the penetration of cercariae; erythema is evident as well. Within 48 hours, inflammatory foci containing neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, CD4+ lymphocytes and degranulating mast cells develop around the parasites.\n\nIn case of repeated infections, the cellular infiltration is substantially elevated and the extensive inflammation may lead to formation of large abscesses or even epidermal and/or dermal necrosis. In humans, the clinical symptoms of cercarial penetration consist of macules/papules formation at the sites where the parasite entered the skin accompanied by intensive itching. The manifestation is more severe in previously sensitised people. This disease, caused not only by \"T. regenti\" but also by cercariae of other bird schistosome species, is called cercarial dermatitis (aka \"swimmer's itch\"). It is regarded as a neglected allergic disease.\nThe next phase of \"T. regenti\" infection is represented by schistosomula migration in the central nervous system. This is accompanied by serious neurological malfunctions in birds that suffer from leg paralysis and balance disorders. In ducks, eosinophilic meningitis with parasites surrounded by eosinophils and heterophils was noted. Additionally, leukocytes infiltrated perivascular spaces and tissues adjacent to the central canal.\n\nAt this stage, schistosomula feed on nervous tissue as demonstrated by detection of oligodendrocytes and neurons in the lumen of parasite's intestine. A cysteine peptidase cathepsin B1 of \"T. regenti\" (TrCB1) localised in intestines of migrating schistosomula is capable of myelin basic protein degradation, thus probably serving for nervous tissue digestion. Nonetheless, the nervous tissue ingestion has likely only a minor pathogenic effect on the host central nervous tissue. This is underpinned by observations of leg paralysis only in immunocompromised hosts, whereas in experiments with immunocompetent mouse strains, the infected animals did not reveal any neurological disorders. The neurological symptoms originate probably in mechanical damage of the nervous tissue leading to dystrophic or even necrotic changes of neurons and axonal injury. The cause of it is large migrating schistosomula (approximately 340×80 μm) which are not destroyed by proper immune response.\n\nIn avian hosts, \"T. regenti\" reaches the nasal tissue where it mates and lay eggs. The gross pathology at this site consists of focal haemorrhages dispersed all over the mucosa. Infiltrates of lymphocytes are present around the eggs and even granulomas containing lymphocytes, eosinophils and heterophils form at later phases. Similar infiltrates are present around free miracidia, but the granuloma formation was not recorded. No cell reaction was noted in the vicinity of adult worms.\n\nThe records on cellular immune response to \"T. regenti\" in ducks are rather scarce. Cell infiltration of affected skin sites in repeatedly infected ducks was only noted, however, lacking further characterization of the infiltrating cells. In the CNS, eosinophils and heterophils surround the parasite but do not prevent its migration towards the final localisation in the nasal mucosa.\n\nConsidering antibody response, anti-cercarial IgM culminates 15 DPI, while anti-cercarial IgY reaches a peak 30 DPI. Ducks infected at higher age have higher anti-cercarial IgY levels than those infected at lower age. However, the anti-cercarial IgY levels are not largely dependant on the infection dose. Several parasite antigens recognized specifically by host IgY are considered as candidates for immunodiagnostics.\n\nThe infection manifests as early type I hypersensitivity reaction and a late phase cutaneous inflammation.\n\nCellular immune response is represented by production of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12p40) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in a skin of mice infected for the first time. Lymphocytes from their skin draining lymph nodes exhibit mixed Th1/Th2 polarization after exposure to parasite antigens. On the contrary, anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 dominate in mice infected repeatedly which also secrete large amounts of histamine from mast cells. Lymphocytes from their skin draining lymph nodes produce IL-4 and IL-5 after stimulation with parasite antigens which shows Th2 polarization of host immune response.\n\nIn a spinal cord, strong cellular immune response consisting of granulocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and T-cells develops in immunocompetent mice especially around the damaged schistosomula. CD3-deficient mice develop no or just mild inflammation which is accompanied by neurological symptoms due to mechanical damage caused to the nervous tissue. Activated microglia are localised in the migratory tracks of schistosomula and in the inflammatory lesions containing parasite residues. Therefore, they were suggested to take part in schistosomula destruction either alone or in cooperation with macrophages and T-cells. Hypertrophied astrocytes are located in the migratory tracks and in the proximity of the schistosomula which implies their role in immune response and tissue reparation. Murine astrocytes and microglia were shown to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) and nitric oxide after \"in vitro\" exposure to parasite antigens, which supports their role in host immune response.\n\nIgM antibody response targets mainly carbohydrate epitopes of parasite molecules. Parasite-specific IgG1 and IgG2a are present as soon as 7 DPI. High levels of IgG1 and IgG2b, but no IgG2a, specific to mostly protein epitopes of cercarial homogenate are detectable as long as 150 DPI in repeatedly infected mice. The level of total IgE increases as soon as 10 DPI and remains high up to 150 DPI in reinfected mice. Increased production of antigen-specific IgG1 and total IgE, but slight decrease in antigen-specific IgG2b corroborate Th2 immune polarization in repeatedly infected individuals.\n\nClinical manifestation of human immune response to \"T. regenti\" infection is known as cercarial dermatitis (\"aka\" swimmer's itch). Majority of humans (82% of adults, 57% of children) who have experienced cercarial dermatitis (caused by undetermined species of bird schistosome) have increased levels of \"T. regenti\" antigen-specific IgG, but not IgE. Cercarial homogenate and excretory-secretory products of \"T. regenti\" induce basophils from humans without a history of cercarial dermatitis to degranulate and release IL-4.\n"}

Although the group's music was unusual, it drew on common influences--punk rock, funk and heavy metal. Punk shows itself in the short duration of many HOLS songs. The gut-level emotional energy of the music (largely attributable to Deibler's voice and guitar style) and the band's DIY ethic also show their punk roots.

Tensions rose in Texas during early 1835 as throughout Mexico federalists began to oppose the increasingly centralist policies of the government. In the summer, Texians elected delegates to a political convention to be held in Gonzales in mid-October. Weeks before the convention and war began, the Texian Militia took up arms against Mexican soldiers at the Battle of Gonzales. The convention was postponed until November 1 after many of the delegates joined the newly organized volunteer Texian Army to initiate a siege of the Mexican garrison at San Antonio de Bexar. On November 3, a quorum was reached in San Antonio. \nWithin days, the delegates passed a resolution to define why Texians were fighting. They expressed allegiance to the deposed Constitution of 1824 and maintained their right to form the General Council. In the next weeks, the council authorized the creation of a new regular army to be commanded by Sam Houston. As Houston worked to establish an army independent from the existing volunteer army, the council repeatedly interfered in military matters.\n\nAfter authorizing an expedition to take Matamoros, Mexico, the council named several men, simultaneously, to organize and lead the assault, angry at the effect the expedition was having on existing Texian garrisons, Smith dissolved the council. Alleging that Smith did not have the authority to disband them, council members impeached him and lieutenant governor James W. Robinson was named acting governor.\n\nThe Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821) severed Spain's control over much of its North American territories, including Texas. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico defined the new country as a federal republic with nineteen states and four territories. Due to limited population and extremely poor economies, the provinces of Texas and Coahuila were combined to become the state Coahuila y Tejas. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the new government liberalized immigration policies for the region. Under the General Colonization Law people from the United States could, for the first time, legally settle in Texas. Large tracts of land were granted to \"empresarios\", who were responsible for recruiting settlers and establishing communities in Texas. With one exception, the new colonies were settled by foreigners. \"Tejanos\", Texas residents of Mexican descent, were soon vastly outnumbered by Anglos. By 1834, an estimated 30,000 Anglos lived in Coahuila y Tejas, compared to only 7,800 Tejanos. By 1833, Texas was divided into three political divisions: the Department of Béxar, the Department of Nacogdoches, and the Department of the Brazos.\n\nBy late 1834, the Mexican government began transitioning from a federalist model to centralism. Santa Anna overturned the 1824 Constitution, dismissed the state legislatures, and ordered all militias disbanded. Federalists throughout Mexico were appalled. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, Agustín Viesca, refused to dissolve the legislature, instead ordering that the session reconvene in Béxar, further from the influence of the Mexican army. Viesca was arrested before he reached Texas. Citizens in the states of Oaxaca and Zacatecas took up arms.\n\nPublic opinion in Texas was divided. In June 1835, one group staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac. Resolutions by the city councils in Mina, Gonzales, Goliad, and Columbia denounced their actions. Civic leaders in Mina were so disgusted they called for public meetings to determine whether settlers supported independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, the \"ayuntamientos\" of both Columbia and San Felipe quickly endorsed the suggestion. They hoped that a political convention would make it quite clear that the majority of Texians did not support the radicals. After the leaders of Columbia argued forcefully for the convention, the political chief of the department of the Brazos called for a meeting of representatives of municipalities in that department on August 1. Only four of the seven appointed delegates appeared. Discovering there was no official agenda, the four men returned home without actually doing anything.\n\nAs a response to the Anahuac disturbances, the commander of the Mexican army in Texas, Domingo de Ugartechea, requested reinforcements to help capture the dissidents. Small groups of soldiers began arriving in early August; in response, local municipalities formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety and unofficial militias. On August 9, citizens at a public meeting in Brazoria again broached the idea of a larger political convention. Other communities debated whether to participate in such a convention, and whether its goals should be simply an exchange of opinions or to create an interim government. The proposed political gathering, which became known as the Consultation, was endorsed by Stephen F. Austin, the first \"empresario\" in Texas, on September 8, which solidified support throughout the Anglo colonies. Austin became the \"de facto\" leader of the Consultation, making plans for the gathering, which would convene on October 15. He requested that each community send one delegate early, to form a Permanent Council to start gathering opinions.\n\nIn the interim, hostilities between Mexican soldiers and Texian colonists increased, and in early October Texian Militia attacked a Mexican army contingent which had been sent to retrieve a cannon that had previously been loaned to Gonzales. This small skirmish marked the official start of the Texas Revolution. Gonzales became a rallying point for Texas settlers who opposed the centralist policies, and men flocked to the town. On October 11, the Texian Militia formed themselves into a volunteer Texian Army and elected Austin as their commander. Many of the Consultation delegates had also gathered in Gonzales, and rather than wait for the session to begin, they joined the army on a march against the Mexican garrison at Béxar.\n\nBy October 16, only 31 delegates had arrived in San Felipe, short of a quorum. Most expected the siege of Béxar to be over very quickly, so the Consultation was postponed until November 1. In the interim, this group of delegates granted power to the Permanent Council, which in practice included representation from only seven districts. The Permanent Council made weak attempts to govern the area, but primarily carried out Austin's orders. In its most controversial move, the council closed all land offices in the region on October 27, to prevent speculators from seizing land during the unrest.\n\nThe siege of Béxar began in late October. Newly arrived immigrant Sam Houston traveled to Béxar to exhort the delegates to leave the siege and come to the Consultation. In a compromise, the officers voted to allow delegates who were members of the rank-and-file or were line officers to leave the siege, while those who were staff officers would remain to oversee military operations. William B. Travis, William Wharton, and Stephen F. Austin remained behind, while twenty delegates, including James Bowie, accompanied Houston to San Felipe.\n\nEach municipality in Texas was encouraged to send five delegates to the convention. Some municipalities, including Nacogdoches, elected seven. A total of 98 delegates were elected. These men were established citizens, with an average length of residence of seven years, with an average age of 38. Approximately one-third of the delegates were staunch supporters of the Constitution of 1824, another third strongly advocated independence, and the remainder were unaligned.\n\nOnly 58 of these men attended. None of the delegates from the war areas - Béxar, Goliad, Refugio, Victoria, and San Patricio - appeared. This effectively ensured that there were no \"Tejano\" delegates that the Consultation. Many delegates from the other regions of Texas remained in the army or stayed home to defend their families. Because Austin and many of his Peace Party supporters were still with the army at Bexar, they were unable to provide as much influence to the gathering as expected.\n\nAn overwhelming percentage of the delegates who attended were men who had previous political experience. Twenty of them had been active in the Communities of Correspondence and Public Safety in their respective towns.\n\nA quorum finally formed on November 3, and delegates continued to arrive over the next few days. Although Austin had endorsed Lorenzo de Zavala to preside over the gathering, delegates elected Branch Tanner Archer of Brazoria. In a speech after his appointment, Archer urged his comrades \"to divest yourselves of all party feelings, to discard every selfish motive, and look alone to the true interest of your country.\" Before the group could move towards official business, Houston rose to a make speech. He gave thanks to many for actions taken over the recent months. His eloquence was unimportant and unnecessary, except as a means for him to become better known to the other delegates. For the remainder of the day, the delegates drafted rules of order. Similar to those used in the legislative bodies of the United States and Europe, the rules emphasized courtesy. In an unusual move, the rules prohibited delegates from abstaining from voting. As president, Archer was forbidden from voting except to break a tie.\n\nThe Consultation's main purpose was to decide the overall goals of the revolution. Members of the War Party advocated for complete independence from Mexico, while Peace Party representatives wished for Texas to remain part of Mexico, but only under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. Although Austin was unable to attend, he did send a letter to the consultation, asking them to follow the Constitution of 1824 and to make it clear to Mexico that the hostilities were not an attempt for independence but instead a determination to fight for their rights as Mexican citizens.\n\nOn November 4, John Wharton was named chair of a committee to determine the purpose of the war. After three full days of deliberation failed to produce a resolution, delegates began a full debate on the floor. The turning point of the discussion came when Houston, who many believed to be a staunch member of the War Party, asked the fellow delegates to refrain from declaring independence. Such a declaration would likely cause many of the people who supported the Constitution of 1824 in other parts of Mexico to refrain from supporting the Texians. The Consultation compromised. On November 7, they released a resolution declaring that \"The people of Texas, availing themselves of their natural rights, solemnly declare that they have taken up arms in defense of their rights and liberties which were threatened by the encroachments of military despots and in defense of the Republican principles of the federal constitution of Mexico of 1824.\" The resolution further specified that Texas reserved the right to create an independent government as long as Mexico was not governed by that document. The members hoped that this wording would allow them to gain support from both federalists within Mexico and from the United States. The resolution passed 33–14.\n\nIn what historian William C. Davis dubbed \"the three shortest yet perhaps most significant resolutions in the document,\" the delegates agreed that Texas would pay for the army, would repay any goods purchased by its agents, and would give volunteers public lands. These were powers reserved for states, and under the Constitution of 1824 Texas was not a stand-alone state. With these words, delegates violated the very constitution they had sworn to uphold. Davis asserts that this provision signified that the delegates fully intended for Texas to become an independent nation, eventually.\n\nFifty-seven delegates signed the resolution. de Zavala translated it into Spanish, and copies in both languages were ordered to be printed and distributed to residents.\nA committee was immediately established to design a provisional government, with Henry Smith as chair. The committee's first proposal was a near-verbatim copy of the preamble to the United States Constitution and included a statement that Texas was now a \"sovereign state\". Delegates voted against this draft and insisted that the committee membership be changed. All committee members who supported independence were removed from their positions, and the new committee began deliberations anew. On November 13, this group produced a document that won approval.\n\nThe new government would consist of a chief executive and a General Council who would share powers. Under the assumption that these two branches would have full cooperation, there was no system of checks and balances. Believing there was no time to wait for general elections, the Consultation determined that the governor and lieutenant governor would be chosen by the delegates themselves, a practice somewhat common among states in the United States. Although Austin was nominated, he lost to Smith 31–22. James Robinson was elected lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Robinson would preside over the General Council, which would consist of one representative from each municipality.\n\nThree delegates-Austin, Archer, and Wharton-were appointed as agents to the United States to try to raise money and volunteers. Austin immediately resigned his post as commander of the volunteers; the troops elected Edward Burleson as their new leader. Houston was appointed to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, as he had spent much of his career dealing with Indian nations. The Texians needed the support of the Indians (or at least their neutrality) to win their fight against Mexico.\n\nThe Consultation officially adjourned on November 15, leaving the new provisional government in charge.\n\nThe soldiers currently fighting near Béxar were volunteers, who joined the army to accomplish a specific task and staunchly maintained their right to elect their own leaders. On November 13, the council officially established a regular army. Houston was appointed to command this new Provisional Army of Texas, subject to the orders of the governor. Houston was instructed to raise an army from scratch; because the volunteers had organized before the Consultation convened, they could not be forced to accept Houston as their commander. The new army should consist of 2,500 men, who would enlist for 2-year terms in exchange for land grants.\n\nAfter consulting with some of the officers currently at the siege of Béxar, notably Travis and James W. Fannin, the council chose to expand the army. On December 5 they created a Corps of Permanent Volunteers, which would have a shorter enlistment period and more autonomy. This move hindered Houston's efforts to fill his regular army; most citizens preferred to join the Permanent Volunteers.\n\nOn December 11, the Mexican troops in Béxar surrendered and agreed to march south of the Rio Grande. With their departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of Mexican troops in Texas, and many of the Texians believed that the war was over. Burleson resigned his leadership of the army on December 15 and returned to his home. Many of the men did likewise, and Frank W. Johnson assumed command of the 400 soldiers who remained.\n\nThe Mexican retreat gave the Council the time to formalize the government and begin planning for the future, without the threat of attack. Little was accomplished. The new Texas government had no funds, so the military was granted the authority to impress any supplies that would be useful. This policy soon resulted in an almost universal hatred of the Council, as food and supplies became scarce, especially in the areas around Goliad and Béxar, where Texian troops were stationed. The \"Telegraph and Texas Register\" noted that \"some are not willing, under the present government, to do any duty...That our government is bad, all acknowledge, and no one will deny.\"\n\nCiting an aborted coup attempt on November 25, Smith proposed a bill making it treasonous to make threats against the provisional government. The Council, by now used to \"the governor's addiction to exaggerated and inflammatory rhetoric\", ignored him. On December 19, a group of prominent citizens, led by Moseley Baker, Wylie Martin, and William Pettus, held a meeting in San Felipe to build support for dismantling the provisional government. They were concerned that the Council was moving too seriously towards independence instead of an adherence to the Constitution of 1824. Yet the Council had not gone far enough for some. Disillusionment with the interim government and an increased militancy among troops, whose ranks were now primarily composed of newly arrived volunteers from the United States, led to calls for a new convention. Brazoria passed a resolution asking for a convention to meet in March 1836 to declare independence. Soldiers in Goliad went a step further and drafted a declaration of independence on December 22. The Council passed a resolution to call the Convention of 1836, to meet on March 1 in Washington-on-the-Brazos.\n\nIn mid-November Governor Viesca, who had been freed by sympathetic soldiers, reached Goliad. The commander at Goliad, Philip Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison; many supported the governor, while others believed that Texas should be an independent country and should therefore not recognize the Mexican governor. Viesca traveled to San Felipe to meet with the General Council, who also refused to recognize his authority as governor. Viesca joined several others in advocating a plan to attack centralist troops in Matamoros. They hoped this Matamoros Expedition would inspire other federalist states to revolt and keep the bored Texian troops from deserting the army. Most importantly, it would move the war zone outside of Texas. The governor initially supported the plan, and asked Houston to organize the expedition; Houston appointed James Bowie to lead the expedition, but Bowie did not receive his orders for several weeks. The Council asked Burleson, the commander of the volunteers at Bexar, to lead the expedition. Burleson had already resigned, and his elected replacement, Johnson, instead received the message. While Johnson journeyed to San Felipe to meet with the Council, on December 30, Johnson's aide-de-camp, James Grant led 200 men from Béxar to travel to Goliad to prepare for the expedition. Only 100 Texians remained at the Alamo Mission in Bexar, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James C. Neill. Neill was disgusted that Johnson had stripped the Alamo of almost all provisions and the majority of the men and sent a strong message to Houston asking for reinforcements and more supplies.36 people attend the consultation\n\nAlthough Bowie also appeared before the Council with his written orders from Houston to lead the Matamoros Expedition, on January 6 the Council authorized Johnson to lead the expedition. Johnson initially declined the commission, but changed his mind the following day. Without revoking Johnson's commission, the Council elected Fannin to lead the mission instead. Smith was incensed when he learned the Council had appointed their own commander for the expedition, and he became even more angry when Houston forwarded the letter from Neill, with an added note that he believed the Johnson mission was illegal, as the council had not had a quorum when it was authorized. By now, both Smith and Houston had decided that the expedition had little chance of success.\n\nSmith denounced the expedition as idiocy and labelled its supporters either fools or traitors. He then disbanded the council until March 1 unless they agreed to renounce the Matamoros Expedition. The council determined that Smith had no authority to dismiss them. They soon impeached Smith and named the lieutenant governor, Robinson, Acting Governor. The documents forming the provisional government, however, did not grant the council the authority to impeach the governor.\n\nOn January 12, Smith wrote a conciliatory letter to the council: \"I admit that I [used] language beyond the rules of decorum\", and declared that if the council would admit that their actions regarding the Matamoros Expedition were wrong he would reinstate them so that \"the two branches [would] again harmonize to the promotion of the true interests of the country\". Weary of the infighting and unsure who was actually in charge, Council members slowly stopped appearing. In the hopes of salvaging a government, Robinson appointed four members to an Advisory Committee. Soon, this dwindled to only two members. The interim government was essentially over by the end of January.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2188443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188443", "title": "Nicholas Hoult", "text": "Nicholas Hoult\n\nNicholas Caradoc Hoult (born 7 December 1989) is an English actor. His body of work includes supporting work in big-budget mainstream productions and starring roles in independent projects in both the American and the British film industries. He has been nominated for awards such as a British Academy Film Award and a Critics Choice Award for his work.\n\nBorn and brought up in Wokingham, Berkshire, Hoult was drawn to acting from a young age and appeared in local theatre productions as a child. He made his screen debut at the age of seven in the 1996 film \"Intimate Relations\", and appeared in several television programmes between 1998 and 2001. Hoult's breakthrough role came when he portrayed Marcus Brewer in the 2002 comedy-drama film \"About a Boy\", for which he was nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer. Hoult earned wider recognition and praise for his performance as Tony Stonem in the E4 teen comedy-drama series \"Skins\" (2007–2008). His transition to adult roles began with the 2009 drama film \"A Single Man\", for which he earned a BAFTA Rising Star Award nomination, and the fantasy film \"Clash of the Titans\" (2010). He was cast as the mutant Hank McCoy in Matthew Vaughn's 2011 superhero film \"\", a role he reprised in later instalments of the series.\n\nIn 2013, Hoult played the lead title role in the fantasy adaptation \"Jack the Giant Slayer\" and starred as a zombie in romantic comedy \"Warm Bodies\". Following a supporting role in \"\" (2015), Hoult starred in a number of independent films before portraying various real-life figures such as Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford in the historical black comedy \"The Favourite\" (2018), the writer J. R. R. Tolkien in \"Tolkien\" (2019), and Peter III in the Hulu miniseries \"The Great\" (2020).\n\nOutside of film, Hoult voiced Elliot in Lionhead Studios' 2010 action role-playing game \"Fable III\", appeared in the 2009 West End play \"New Boy\", and is involved in philanthropy, supporting such charitable organisations as Teenage Cancer Trust and Christian Aid. He has a son from his relationship with American model Bryana Holly.\n\nNicholas Caradoc Hoult was born in Wokingham, Berkshire, to piano teacher Glenis (\"née\" Brown) and pilot Roger Hoult. His middle name, Caradoc (pronounced /ka.ˈrɑː.dɔk/), is Welsh and translates to \"The Beloved One\". His paternal great-aunt was Dame Anna Neagle, a stage and film actress active in the 1930s and 1940s. He has three siblings: an elder brother James, who is a United States-based biology student; and two sisters, Rosanna and Clarista, both of whom are television actors. Hoult spent most of his childhood at his family's residence in Sindlesham, an estate village in the borough of Wokingham. His older siblings were interested in acting and dancing from an early age, taking classes and attending auditions. As a child, he began accompanying them and developed his own interest in acting. He discussed his childhood and his relationship with his siblings in a 2011 interview with \"The Guardian\" saying, \"[we were] pretty outdoorsy normal kids running around in the garden and making tree houses ... it was very normal\".\n\nDuring Hoult's childhood, his father was regularly working away from home and his brother was away attending school. As a result, he spent most of his time with his mother and sisters; he said being raised by women might have helped him \"steer clear of some pitfalls that guys who didn't grow up with women would fall into\". Hoult was educated at The Coombes Infant and Nursery School and then Arborfield Church of England Junior School. He practised ballet with his sisters and took part in productions of \"Swan Lake\" and \"The Nutcracker\" with the English National Ballet. Although he initially wanted to attain advanced level certificates in English, Biology, and Psychology, in 2002, at the age of 12, he decided instead to attend acting school at Sylvia Young Theatre School. At the age of 14, he left to attend the Church of England's secondary school Ranelagh School. Hoult played trombone as a child and was a member of the local choir.\n\nNicholas' acting potential was discovered at the age of three by a theatre director during a performance of a play that starred Nicholas' brother. The director was impressed at Nicholas' ability to \"concentrate well\" and offered him a role in his next theatre production, \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\". Hoult began attending auditions and at the age of five was cast in the 1996 drama \"Intimate Relations\", his first feature-film role. He later appeared in the television programmes \"Casualty\", \"Silent Witness\", \"The Bill\", \"Judge John Deed\", and \"Doctors\", among others. Hoult initially treated acting as a hobby rather than a potential career option; in a March 2009 interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\", he said he was not \"in love with it ... I just enjoyed it. It was like playing for a football team. When you got a part it was great. And meeting new people. It was an exciting new world.\"\n\nHoult's next feature-film appearance came at the age of eleven alongside Hugh Grant in Chris and Paul Weitz's 2002 comedy-drama film \"About a Boy\". Hoult was initially reluctant to audition for the role as the casting process was a lengthy one and interfered with his schooling. He nonetheless decided to participate in the early rounds of auditions and was eventually cast in the role of Marcus, a \"woolly-hatted, oddball son of a suicidal, hippy-ish single mother, [who] gets bullied horribly at school\". \"About a Boy\" was a commercial success, grossing more than $130million worldwide and receiving praise by film critics. Hoult's portrayal of a lonely schoolboy was well-received; David Thomas, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", attributed the film's appeal and success to Hoult's performance. By the time the film was released, Hoult had left his junior school in Arborfield and began attending Sylvia Young Theatre School in London. He said the change was difficult; his time there was short and he preferred attending a regular school. He still did not want to pursue acting as a profession and at 14 he left Sylvia Young Theatre School in favour of Ranelagh School, a Bracknell-based Church of England day school.\n\nHoult starred in Richard E. Grant's semi-autobiographical film \"Wah-Wah\" (2005) as Ralph Compton, a boy who is forced to deal with the disintegration of his family. The film, set in Swaziland during the 1960s, chronicles the decline of the British Empire in Africa. Hoult made his debut in Hollywood with Gore Verbinski's film \"The Weather Man\" (2005) as the son of a television weather presenter (Nicolas Cage) undergoing a mid-life crisis. The film and Hoult's performance went unnoticed. Both \"Wah-Wah\" and \"The Weather Man\" performed poorly at the box office.\n\nHoult was a student at Sixth Form College Farnborough in 2006 when he was cast in the lead role of the television teenage-drama \"Skins\". He was initially sceptical of his ability to play Tony Stonem, a manipulative, egocentric anti-hero, and identified more closely with the supporting character Sid. The programme was a success and ran for seven series, only two of which Hoult appeared in. His performance was well received; the character was popular, and Hoult garnered widespread attention. \"Skins\" won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Philip Audience Award, and Hoult was nominated for the Golden Nymph Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Critic Elliott David lauded Hoult for his performance in a 2016 retrospective review, and wrote that he \"maintain[ed] the inexplicable core of his character throughout\". During his time on \"Skins\", Hoult felt overwhelmed by the attention he received and considered discontinuing acting at one point. Instead, he left school at the end of \"Skins\" first season and chose to focus solely on acting.\n\nHoult briefly appeared as Stefan Fredman in the pilot episode of the British television series \"Wallander\". He later made his West End theatre debut as Mark, the protagonist in William Sutcliffe's coming-of-age play \"New Boy\"; the production premiered at Trafalgar Studios and had record-breaking ticket sales, which was mostly attributed to Hoult's popularity among viewers of \"Skins\". The play was staged for a week in March 2009 because Hoult had committed to a part in the fantasy-adventure film \"Clash of the Titans\" (2010), filming for which was scheduled for mid-2010. Hoult's performance as Mark, a \"ferociously bright and articulate but sexually confused sixth-former\" received mixed responses from critics. Dominic Cavendish of \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote that his performance was persuasive, but Lyn Gardner of \"The Guardian\" found him average and highlighted his inability to bring out the \"unresolved sexual tension beneath [the] banter\". \"Clash of the Titans\" was panned by critics but was a success at the box office, grossing nearly $500,000,000 worldwide.\n\nHoult next appeared in Tom Ford's \"A Single Man\" (2009), after the actor originally cast in the role of Kenny Potter left the film a few days before filming commenced. Hoult had previously shown interest in the project and had sent a recorded audition tape; he was eventually chosen for the role of Kenny, a homosexual college student who helps a college professor, played by Colin Firth, deal with his grief. \"A Single Man\" was variously described by media outlets as the first adult role for Hoult, who described Kenny as a \"spontaneous\" character not simply defined by his sexuality. Because the role was his first as an American character, Hoult worked on his accent; Sukhdev Sandhu of \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted Ford's choice of casting British actors as Americans (Hoult and Matthew Goode) and vice versa (Julianne Moore). \"A Single Man\" opened to widespread acclaim despite reservations from critics about Ford's directorial abilities; it was a box-office success. The film earned Hoult a nomination for the BAFTA Rising Star Award at the 2010 ceremony; Kristen Stewart won the award. In 2010, Hoult voiced the character of Elliot in Lionhead Studios' action role-playing game \"Fable III\" (2010).\n\nHoult was cast as Nux in George Miller's action film \"\"; the project spent several years in development hell because plans for a fourth film in the \"Mad Max\" franchise encountered financial difficulties. Filming was planned for mid-2010, but heavy rain caused severe delays during pre-production in Australia. With no other immediate commitments, Hoult began to look for other prospects. He was eventually cast in the role of Hank McCoy / Beast for the \"X-Men\" film series owing to his ability to play somebody \"gentle with a capability of being fierce\". Although earlier reports had said Benjamin Walker was to play the role, Hoult was finalised for the 2011 Matthew Vaughn-directed instalment \"\", a prequel to the franchise's earlier films. Before filming began, Hoult familiarised himself with his character; he said he \"formulated [his] own version of the Beast\" and took inspiration from Kelsey Grammer's performance in the previous \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" because he wanted to emulate Grammer's charm and eloquence. Hoult learnt to speak in a dialect similar to Grammer's without trying to imitate it. He also underwent physical training and gained weight to better suit his character. The film, which was widely praised by critics for its script and performances, performed moderately well at the box office, collecting about $353million against a production budget of $160million. Although it was the lowest-ranked production in the entire series in terms of revenue, Chris Aronson of 20th Century Fox deemed it \"an excellent start to a new chapter of the franchise\".\n\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" was eventually filmed in 2012 in the Namibian desert. Miller had conceived Nux, a terminally ill slave, as a \"quasi kamikaze pilot\"; Hoult said of his character; \"he's very enthusiastic and committed and affectionate but also kind of clumsy\". Hoult shaved his head and followed a strict diet because his role required him to lose a lot of weight. He also talked about performing stunts in the film, describing the entire experience as \"scary\", but favourably compared the stunt crew and Miller's choice to incorporate real action sequences instead of using a green screen, saying it made the performance more believable because the actors are placed in a real situation. \"Fury Road\" opened to critical acclaim on 14 May 2015 and grossed more than $378million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the \"Mad Max\" franchise. The technical aspects and stunt sequences drew particular praise from film critics and it was credited for reviving interest in the series. Shalini Langer noted that while the real hero of the film was Theron, \"[Hoult] is the closest in the acting department ... as Joe's 'war boy' chasing imagined glory\". Hoult's \"fabulously unhinged\" performance was also praised by Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\". Also in 2012, Hoult was included in the \"Forbes\" 30 under 30 list.\n\nIn 2013, Hoult had starring roles in two major films; he first played a zombie named R in Jonathan Levine's romantic comedy \"Warm Bodies\", which was released on 1 February. An adaptation of Isaac Marion's novel of the same name, the film is presented from point of view of the central character, mostly through narration. Levine said he had difficulties finding a suitable actor to play R until he met Hoult, who was attracted to the project—which he described as \"much more than a horror movie\" owing to the use of multiple pop culture and literary allusions—and even more so to the role which \"bowled [me] over\". Hoult said he drew inspiration from \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990) because he thought the central characters in both films share the same difficulties. To prepare for the role of a zombie, Hoult and the other actors practiced with Cirque du Soleil performers; he said of the experience; \"we would take our shoes off in a dance studio ... kind of grow out of the wall and make our bodies feel very heavy\". The film garnered positive response from critics and audiences. Ben Kendrick praised Hoult for the restraint in a potentially Razzie-worthy role: \"[he] brings a lot of life to R without stepping too far in the other direction [and although his] zombie mannerisms may come across a bit forced but, overall, his memorable moments outnumber (and outweigh) the awkward ones.\" Hoult was also described as \"an extremely appealing actor, [who] is charm personified\" in his role of the living-dead.\n\nHoult's next film, Bryan Singer's 2013 fantasy adventure \"Jack the Giant Slayer\", failed at the box office and received mixed response from critics. He played the eponymous hero in the film, which is based on the British fairy tales \"Jack the Giant Killer\" and \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". Hoult's performance was poorly received by film critics Mary Pols, Justin Chang and Richard Roeper; Pols was critical of his \"disconcerting\" imitation of Hugh Grant and the other two dismissed him and his character as \"bland\" and \"boring\", respectively.\n\nHoult then appeared in Jake Paltrow's science-fiction film \"Young Ones\" (2014). Set in a dystopian future where water is scarce, the film had Hoult play Flem Lever, a young man who is trying to claim the land owned by the film's central character Ernest Holm (Michael Shannon). Hoult thought the role was unlike any of his previous work and said his character's questionable choices throughout the film intrigued him. Hoult read novels written by S. E. Hinton to prepare for the role. The film was shot in a deserted location in South Africa; Hoult said filming in the hot weather conditions was difficult but the \"beautiful\" scenery helped to tell the story better. He and his co-star Elle Fanning said it also made them more conscious of environmental concerns. The film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and was met with mixed responses. Commentators highlighted the film's standout scenery but were critical of its plot. Keith Uhlich of \"The A.V. Club\" said Hoult was a poor fit for the story's \"stoically retrograde machismo\".\n\nHoult reprised his role as Hank McCoy in Bryan Singer's \"\", his other release of 2014. Hoult said playing the character was a freeing experience for him and that it was \"fun to suddenly be able to break loose ... when you're wearing the makeup ... you can perform big ... you get to have two very different techniques, performances.\" He also said the lengthy make-up procedure could last up to three and a half hours. \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" earned more than $747million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the series and in Hoult's career at that time.\n\nIn 2015, Hoult had three other releasesthe feature film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's mystery novel \"Dark Places\"; Owen Harris' dark comedy \"Kill Your Friends\", based on the 2008 novel of the same name; and \"Equals\", a dystopian, science-fiction romantic drama directed by Drake Doremusall of which were critical failures and rank among the lowest-grossing films of his career. Response to Hoult's performance in \"Equals\" was relatively better; Peter Travers dubbed him and his co-star Kristen Stewart \"quietly devastating\" and Katie Walsh, writing for \"Los Angeles Times\", said the duo were \"finely matched both in their androgynous beauty and in their performances of a repressed humanity\". Despite doubts about his contract with the franchise, Hoult returned for the 2016 film \"\". Upon release, the film became the third-ranked \"X-Men\" film in terms of worldwide box office collections, earning about $540million. It was also a top-grossing production outside the United States.\n\nThe action film \"Collide\", which had Hoult star as a drug dealer, was released in the United States in February 2017 to a poor response from audiences and critics. The film garnered negative reviews; its dismal box office performance was attributed to poor marketing and multiple delays caused by the 2015 chapter 11 bankruptcy of its production company Relativity Media. \"Forbes\" Scott Mendelson analysed the film's failure and said Hoult did not necessarily have enough \"star power\" to draw audiences. He also responded negatively to Felicity Jones' casting as a damsel in distress, which he said further damaged the film's chances of success. He highlighted the misogyny and sense of entitlement in the entertainment industry, writing that director Eran Creevy and Hoult would get better offers despite the failure of films like \"Collide\", as opposed to the women and other minority groups, who are either ignored or stereotyped. Responses to Hoult's next film, the romance drama \"Newness\", were more enthusiastic. The production had its world premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival; it stars Hoult and Laia Costa as a Los Angeles-based couple who meet through online dating and begin an open relationship. Drake Doremus, the film's director, said Hoult's role was unlike his previous work; \"a very complex and emotionally mature performance that we haven't seen yet\".\n\nHoult starred in a series of biographical and historical films in 2017; he said he preferred playing characters that might help him improve as an actor and that the \"actors I look up to started doing their best work in their early 30s and I'll be hitting that age ... I'm just trying to learn\". He portrayed American author J. D. Salinger in Danny Strong's \"Rebel in the Rye\", which chronicles Salinger's life from his youth to the World War II era and the years preceding the publication of his debut novel, \"The Catcher in the Rye\". Hoult auditioned for the role because he was intrigued by the film's script and Salinger's enigmatic personality; \"I didn’t know he fought in the second world war and landed on D-Day: ... had intermittent PTSD or that he became interested in Vedanta philosophy and meditated and did yoga.\" To prepare for the role, Hoult read \"The Catcher in the Rye\" and biographies about Salinger. Hoult said the biggest challenge was to get a real understanding of Salinger's character; \"everyone has an idea of [Salinger] in their mind ... you're creating a character that people have very strong feelings about. You can't prove to be right or wrong through impressions.\" \"Rebel in the Rye\" opened to a poor response from film critics. Carson Lund of \"Slant\" was largely unimpressed by Hoult's \"feeble\" performance and his inability to \"reinvest the character with the complexities lost in the story’s programmatic telling\". \"RogerEbert.com\"s Matt Fagerholm wrote that although Hoult was capable of illuminating the insecurities and fixations of his character, he is never \"quite believable as Salinger\". Fagerholm ascribed the failure to the script, which left the character's key motivations \"frustratingly muddled\".\n\nHoult co-starred with Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Shannon in \"The Current War\", a dramatisation of the feud between electrical pioneers Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, played by Cumberbatch and Shannon respectively. Hoult was cast in the role of Nikola Tesla, for which he grew a moustache and attended science lessons about electromagnetism and dynamos. He lost weight for his role by following a strict diet. Response to \"The Current War\" was mixed; David Ehrlich of IndieWire described Hoult's performance as a tribute to David Bowie, who had previously played Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006). In a departure from biographical dramas, Hoult next starred as an American soldier in \"Sand Castle\", a production he described as a very different war film \"in terms of the pacing and the emotion ... very under the surface, that futility-of-war idea\". He recalled the filming experience in the Jordanian military bases practising clearing procedures: “we put on these masks, get given these guns, are put inside this pitch-black house ... try and hunt down these bad guys hiding inside. You’re in all the gear ... the adrenaline starts pumping.\" Released on Netflix in April 2017, the film garnered mixed reviews.\n\nIn 2018, he co-starred in the critically acclaimed period drama \"The Favourite\" as Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He also appeared in the British-Irish-American animated television mini-series adaptation of Richard Adams' 1972 novel \"Watership Down\"; the mini-series is directed by Noam Murro and adapted by Tom Bidwell. He voiced one of the lead characters, Fiver. In 2019, Hoult starred as author J. R. R. Tolkien in the biopic \"Tolkien\". He also reprised his role as Hank McCoy in the X-Men film \"Dark Phoenix\", which was released in the same year. Hoult next starred as Peter III of Russia in the Hulu miniseries \"The Great\", which premiered in May 2020.\n\nHoult dated American actress Jennifer Lawrence, his co-star in the \"X-Men\" films, for five years. Since March 2017, Hoult has been in a relationship with American model Bryana Holly Bezlaj. In April 2018, the couple had their first child, a son.\n\nDuring his childhood, Hoult played basketball for the Reading-based team Reading Rockets, which played in the English Basketball League. He was later appointed as the club's ambassador. He also follows Formula One and has attended several Grand Prix events at Montreal, Singapore, and Germany.\n\nHoult is a philanthropist and supports numerous charities; he has been associated with organisations that support children. He was appointed the first National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) Young Person Ambassador, for supporting the charity's activities aimed at children and young people. Since 2009, he has also been involved with the Teenage Cancer Trust; he continues to visit patients supported by the organisation and has helped promote its awareness campaigns, including the sun-safety campaign \"Shunburn\". Hoult designed sweaters for Save the Children's and Selfish Mother's joint Christmas Jumper Day campaign. He encouraged customers to buy the festive collection and support the charitable cause, which he thought would bring a \"real change to children's lives\". He also donated a pair of shoes, which was auctioned by Small Steps Project, an organisation that helps homeless and malnourished children. Hoult was inducted into the NSPCC Hall of Fame in 2010, for his contributions to the campaign against child cruelty.\n\nHoult visited Nairobi, Kenya, as a part of a Christian Aid project aimed at providing clean water and sanitation. During his stay he met local people and helped clean the locality. He said of his experience; \"I met great people making the best of the situation ... it is heart-breaking in many ways to see the living conditions\". Hoult also participated in the Rickshaw Run in January 2017, in which participants drove an auto rickshaw (also called a \"tuk tuk\") for across India to raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust and World Wide Fund for Nature. He has also been associated with Jeans for Refugees, a project and fundraising initiative intended to help refugees around the world. He donated a signed pair of jeans to the organisation; profits from the campaign were donated to the refugee support agency International Rescue Committee.\n\nFor his role in \"About a Boy\" (2002), Hoult won the Best Youth Performance at the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards and earned a nomination for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer. He was nominated for the 2010 British Academy Film Awards for Orange Rising Star Award for his role in \"A Single Man\".\n\n"}

Unlike its relatives, which are for the most part substantial trees and shrubs, \"C. canadensis\" is a creeping, rhizomatous perennial growing to about tall.\n\n\"Cornus canadensis\" is a slow-growing herbaceous perennial growing 10–20 cm tall, generally forming a carpet-like mat. The above-ground shoots rise from slender creeping rhizomes that are placed 2.5–7.5 cm deep in the soil, and form clonal colonies under trees. The vertically produced above-ground stems are slender and unbranched. The leaves are oppositely arranged on the stem, but are clustered with six leaves that often seem to be in a whorl because the internodes are compressed. The leafy green leaves are produced near the terminal node and consist of two types: 2 larger and 4 smaller leaves. The smaller leaves develop from the axillary buds of the larger leaves. The shiny dark green leaves have 2 to 3 mm long petioles and leaf blades that are obovate. The blades have entire margins and are 3.5 to 4.8 cm long and 1.5 to 2.5 cm wide, with 2 or 3 veins and cuneate shaped bases and abruptly acuminate apexes. In the fall, the leaves have red tinted veins and turn completely red.\n\nIn late spring to midsummer, white flowers are produced that are in diameter with reflexed petals that are ovate-lanceolate in shape and long. Inflorescences are made up of compound terminal cymes, with large showy white bracts that resemble petals. The bracts are green when immature. The bracts are broadly ovate and long and wide, with 7 parallel running veins. The lower nodes on the stem have greatly reduced rudimentary leaves. The calyx tube is obovate in shape and 1 mm long, covered with densely pubescent hairs along with grayish white appressed trichomes. Stamens are very short, being 1 mm long. The anthers are yellowish white in color, narrowly ovoid in shape. The styles are 1 mm long and glabrous. Plants are for the most part self-sterile and dependent on pollinators for sexual reproduction. Pollinators include bumblebees, solitary bees, beeflies, and syrphid flies. The fruits look like berries but are drupes.\n\nEach flower has highly elastic petals that flip backward, releasing springy filaments that are cocked underneath the petals. The filaments snap upward flinging pollen out of containers hinged to the filaments. The stamen accelerate at a rate of 24,000 m/s. This motion takes place in less than half a millisecond and the pollen experiences two to three thousand times the force of gravity. The bunchberry has one of the fastest plant actions found so far requiring a camera capable of shooting 10,000 frames per second to catch the action.\n\nThe drupes are green, globose in shape, turning bright red at maturity in late summer; each fruit is 5 mm in diameter and contains typically one or two ellipsoid-ovoid shaped stones. The fruits, coming into season in late summer, are edible but not appetizing. The large seeds within are somewhat hard and crunchy.\n\nWhile distinctive as a species itself, the generic placement of these plants has differed in various botanical treatments. When the genus \"Cornus\" is taken broadly, as done here, this species is \"Cornus canadensis\", and is included in the subgenus \"Arctocrania\". However, if \"Cornus\" is treated in a narrower sense, excluding this species, it can instead be classified as \"Chamaepericlymenum canadense\" or as \"Cornella canadensis.\"\n\nWhere bunchberry, a forest species, and \"Cornus suecica\", a bog species, grow near each other in their overlapping ranges in Alaska, Labrador, and Greenland, they can hybridize by cross-pollination, producing plants with intermediate characteristics.\n\n\"Cornus canadensis\" is a mesophytic species that needs cool, moist soils. It inhabits montane and boreal coniferous forests, where it is found growing along the margins of moist woods, on old tree stumps, in mossy areas, and among other open and moist habitats.\n\nBirds are the main dispersal agents of the seeds, feeding on the fruit during their fall migration. In Alaska, bunchberry is an important forage plant for mule deer, black-tailed deer and moose, which eat it throughout the growing season.\n\nClaire Waight Keller included the plant to represent Canada in Meghan Markle's wedding veil, which included the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country.\n\n"}

The movie is based on the true-life murder of Lancaster native Laurie Show.\n\nThe movie follows 16-year-old Laurie Show (Jennifer Finnigan), a naive and trusting girl that became entangled in the lives of Lisa Michelle Lambert (Marne Patterson) and her boyfriend Lawrence Yunkin. Laurie was initially befriended by Michelle, who later turned on her after Laurie was raped by Lawrence. Believing that Laurie was lying about the rape and that she had pursued Lawrence, Michelle began harassing and stalking Laurie, often with the assistance of friends. This harassment culminated in Michelle murdering Laurie in her home with the help of her friend Tabitha Buck. Laurie's mother discovered the body and Michelle, Lawrence, and Tabitha were quickly arrested. Lawrence pleaded guilty and testified against the other two girls in exchange for a reduced sentence, with Michelle and Tabitha receiving life sentences without parole.\n\n\nCritical reception for the film was predominantly negative, with both Variety and People panning the film.

{"id": "2188476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188476", "title": "Manny Ramirez", "text": "Manny Ramirez\n\nManuel Arístides Ramírez Onelcida (born May 30, 1972) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for parts of 19 seasons. He played with the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, and Tampa Bay Rays before playing one season at the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan. Ramirez is recognized for having great batting skill and power. He was a nine-time Silver Slugger and was one of 27 players to hit 500 career home runs. His 21 grand slams are third all-time, and his 29 postseason home runs are the most in MLB history. He appeared in 12 All-Star Games, with a streak of eleven consecutive games beginning in 1998 that included every season that he played with the Red Sox.\n\nRamirez was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. When he was 13 years old, he moved to New York City with his parents, Onelcida and Aristides. He attended George Washington High School and became a baseball standout. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the 1991 MLB draft, 13th overall. He made his MLB debut on September 2, 1993.\n\nIn 1994, Ramirez became a major league regular, and finished second in voting for the Rookie of the Year Award. By 1995, he had become an All-Star. He was with the Indians in playoff appearances in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999; this included an appearance in the 1995 and 1997 World Series. In 1999, Ramirez set the Indians' single-season RBIs record with 165 RBIs. After the 2000 season, Ramirez signed with the Boston Red Sox. During his time in Boston, Ramirez and teammate David Ortiz became one of the best offensive tandems in baseball history. Ramirez led the Red Sox to World Series Championships in 2004 and 2007 before being traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008 as part of a three team deal that also involved the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating baseball's drug policy by taking human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug that is often taken after steroids. In the spring of 2011, Ramirez was informed by MLB of another violation of its drug policy, and a 100-game suspension. He chose to retire on April 8 rather than be suspended. However, in September 2011, Ramirez wished to be reinstated and agreed in December with the league to a reduced 50-game suspension. Though he played at various points in the Oakland Athletics, Texas Rangers, and Chicago Cubs systems, as well as internationally, Ramirez did not appear in another Major League game.\n\nKnown as a complete hitter who could hit for both power and average, and widely regarded as one of the best right handed hitters of his generation, Ramirez finished his career with a lifetime .312 batting average, 555 home runs (15th all time), and 1,831 RBI (18th all time). In 111 postseason games, Ramirez posted a .285 batting average with 29 home runs and 78 RBI.\n\nRamirez was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez and spent thirteen years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers to be one of his most prized possessions. In 1985, he moved to the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City with his parents. He often played ball at the nearby Snake Hill, the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood. Despite living just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto Blue Jays, who had his Dominican heroes George Bell and Tony Fernández on its roster; he attended games when the Blue Jays were in town.\n\nRamirez attended George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving at the age of 19 without graduating. During his time on the team, GWHS was seeing a large increase in the number of immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans. As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often very modest.\n\nDuring his time at GWHS, he led his team to three straight division championships. He was a three-time all-city selection in baseball, and as a high school senior was named New York City Public School Player of the Year in 1991, hitting for a .650 batting average with 14 home runs in 22 games. He was inducted into the New York City Public School Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nThe Cleveland Indians selected Ramirez with the 13th pick of the 1991 draft and gave him a $250,000 signing bonus. He was assigned to the Rookie-level Burlington Indians for his professional debut. He was named the Appalachian League MVP and was selected by \"Baseball America\" as short-season Player of the Year while slugging 19 homers and driving in 63 runs in 59 games, while leading the league in slugging and total bases.\n\nWith the Single-A Kinston Indians in 1992, Ramirez battled injuries but still hit .278 with 13 homers and 63 RBIs in 81 games and was named as the number three prospect and the \"Most Exciting Player in the Carolina League\" by Baseball America. In 1993, Ramirez was named \"Minor League Player of the Year\" by Baseball America while hitting .333 with 31 homers and 115 RBIs in 129 combined games with the Double-A Canton–Akron Indians and Triple-A Charlotte Knights.\n\nRamirez made his major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the Minnesota Twins, going hitless in four at bats as the designated hitter.\n\nThe following day, when the Indians took on the New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many of his family and friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.\n\nIn 1994, his first full season in the majors, Ramirez had a strong start to the season, hitting six home runs during the month of April. Despite a weak start to May, he rebounded in the latter half of the month, finishing the month with a .300 batting average. During the season, the Indians were chasing the Chicago White Sox for first place in the American League Central (AL Central) division all the way until the end of the season. However, the team's season ended in August due to the 1994 MLB strike. Ramirez finished second in the Rookie of the Year award voting after batting .269 with 17 home runs and 60 RBIs in 91 games.\n\nRamirez's breakout season came in 1995, when he batted .308 with 31 home runs and 107 RBIs. In July, he was selected to his first All-Star Game and won his first career Silver Slugger Award following the season. That year, the Indians reached the postseason, and Ramirez hit two home runs in the 1995 American League Championship Series against the Mariners, which the Indians won in six games. The Indians then took on the Atlanta Braves in the World Series, and Ramirez batted .222 with one home run in the Indians' six-game loss. In December 1995, Ramirez agreed to a $10.15 million, four-year contract.\n\nRamirez continued to hit well in 1996, batting .309 with 33 home runs and 112 RBIs. The Indians again reached the playoffs, and Ramirez batted .375 with 2 home runs in the Indians' loss to the Orioles in the 1996 American League Division Series. In 1997, Ramirez's contact continued to improve, though his power dipped slightly, as he hit .328 with 26 home runs and 88 RBIs. This year, the Indians again reached the World Series, and Ramirez batted .154 with two home runs as the Indians lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games.\n\nIn 1998, Ramirez experienced a great increase in power, on his way to becoming one of the great run producers in the game. He batted .294 with 45 home runs and 145 RBIs, and was selected to his second All-Star Game, where he recorded a sacrifice fly and RBI. Ramirez batted .357 with 2 home runs during the ALDS versus the Red Sox, which the Indians won in four games. In the ALCS against the Yankees, Ramirez batted .333 with two home runs, but the Indians lost in six games. Following the season, Ramirez came in sixth place in AL MVP voting.\n\nRamirez began 1999 on a hot streak, hitting .337 with 7 home runs in the month of April. Ramirez's hot hitting continued all season, as he batted .364 in May and reached the All-Star break with 25 home runs and 96 RBIs. At the time, it was the third highest single season total for RBI by the All-Star Break in MLB history, behind only Hank Greenberg (103 in 1935) and Juan González (101 in 1998). On September 30, 1999, Ramirez broke the Indians' single-season RBI record (previously 162 by Hal Trosky in 1936) by hitting a 3-run home run, giving Ramirez 164. He finished 1999 with 165 RBIs, the highest total by any player since Jimmie Foxx (1938), and batted an eye popping .383 against left handed pitchers. He also batted .383 with runners in scoring position, and .377 with men on base. That season, he finished third in the voting for the AL MVP award. However, he struggled in the 1999 postseason, going 1-for-18 as the Indians were eliminated by the Boston Red Sox in 5 games in the 1999 American League Division Series.\n\nIn 2000, Ramirez was limited to 118 games due to injuries, but recorded a career-high .351 batting average, along with 38 home runs and 122 RBIs. His return is believed to have started a major comeback that led the Indians to a final record of 90–72 and cut the number of games they were behind the leader of the AL Central, the Chicago White Sox, from 11.5 games down to 7.5 games in just a month. Because of his return, Roberto Alomar, Omar Vizquel, and Kenny Lofton all started getting better pitches to hit, which also significantly increased their batting averages. Despite the comeback, the Indians failed to make the postseason, finishing 5 games behind the White Sox in the AL Central. With free agency looming, Ramirez homered in his final game and at-bat in an Indians uniform, on October 1 against Toronto in front of the home fans at Jacobs Field.\n\nIn November 2000, the Indians offered Ramirez a seven-year, $119 million contract. While this would have made Ramirez the highest-paid player in baseball, the deal was rejected by Ramirez and his agent, Jeff Moorad, who were seeking a ten-year, $200 million contract. Ramirez was reportedly pursued by the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners, but in December agreed to an eight-year, $160 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, with $20 million options for 2009 and 2010, pushing the total value of the contract to $200 million for 10 years.\n\nRamirez immediately delivered for the Red Sox, hitting .408 in April 2001. He had another sterling first half, amassing a .335 batting average with 26 home runs and 84 RBI at the 2001 All-Star break. However, he missed some time battling hamstring injuries and struggled down the stretch, finishing at .306 with 41 home runs and 125 RBI. On June 23, Ramirez hit two monstrous home runs against the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park, with the second one hitting the very top of the light tower in left field. Its length was officially listed at 501 feet, second-longest by a Red Sox player in Fenway Park's history, just short of Ted Williams' 1946 record of 502 feet. He also launched a prodigious home run in an away game on June 3 against the Blue Jays into the fifth deck at the SkyDome, which still stands as the longest home run in that ballpark's history at 491 feet. However, despite his efforts, the Red Sox did not qualify for the MLB postseason in 2001. Ramirez, primarily a right fielder in his career to this point, spent most of the season as the designated hitter for the Red Sox. This was due to the Red Sox' belief that Ramirez was best suited to left field due to the presence of Trot Nixon in right, as well as the injuries Ramirez battled during the 2001 season. After signing with the Red Sox, Ramirez played only 7 more games in right field, all of which came during the 2002 season.\n\nRamirez only played in 120 games in 2002 due to a hamstring injury that put him on the disabled list (DL) from mid-May to the end of June. Despite this, Ramirez won the AL batting title, hitting .349 (including .438 against lefties), and his .647 slugging percentage was second in the league behind Jim Thome's .677. Like clockwork, Ramirez again reached the 30 home run and 100 RBI plateaus, posting 33 and 107 respectively. He hit his 300th career home run on August 26 against the Angels' Ramón Ortiz. It was the first of two home runs on the night for Ramirez, as he went 5-for-5 overall. However, the Red Sox again failed to qualify for the MLB postseason in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Ramirez again posted strong offensive numbers, finishing with a .325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two punch in the middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny was just talking to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.\n\nDuring the offseason that followed, the new Red Sox ownership (led by John W. Henry) and management tried to rid themselves of Ramirez's massive contract, despite his high level of production. Believed to be necessary in pursuit of a trade for Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the team put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers, thus making him available to any team willing to assume the remainder of his contract. However, all 29 other teams passed on the opportunity to claim Ramirez due to the high cost, and Rodriguez was acquired by the Yankees instead, as a replacement for Boone after the latter had blown out his knee playing offseason basketball.\n\nAlso noteworthy from 2003 (though it was not revealed until 2009), according to the \"New York Times\", Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs that season from the \"survey\" drug test, in which MLB players were tested to see if drugs were being used. Players faced no penalties or sanctions for testing positive. Ramirez was one of 104 players to have allegedly tested positive.\n\nIn 2004, Ramirez led the AL in home runs (43), slugging percentage (.613) and OPS (1.009); he finished second in errors committed as a left fielder (7), third in RBIs (130), fourth in doubles (44) and total bases (348), sixth in on-base percentage (.397), eighth in walks (82), tenth in runs (108), and posted a .308 batting average. He also led the AL in salary, at $22.5 million.\n\nIn addition, Ramirez and teammate David Ortiz became the first pair of AL teammates to hit 40 home runs, have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees' Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1931. Together they hit back-to-back home runs six times, tying the major league single-season mark set by the Detroit Tigers' Hank Greenberg and Rudy York and later matched by the Chicago White Sox's Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordóñez.\n\nIn the 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Ramirez hit a two-run home run off Roger Clemens in the top of the first inning, giving his teammates a 3–0 lead. Ramirez, Derek Jeter (with a single), Ichiro Suzuki (with a double) and Iván Rodríguez (with a triple) became the first All-Star quartet that combined to hit for the cycle during the same inning. The Red Sox again qualified for the postseason, and Ramirez continued his hot hitting. He hit .385 in the 2004 ALDS, leading the Red Sox to a sweep over the Anaheim Angels, and setting up a rematch in the 2004 American League Championship Series against the Yankees. Despite not driving in a run in the ALCS, Ramirez hit .300 as the Red Sox completed a historic comeback from down 3 games to 0 to win in seven against the Yankees, setting up a showdown with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series as the Red Sox attempted to end the Curse of the Bambino and win their first championship since 1918. Ramirez proceeded to hit .412 with a home run and 4 RBI in a 4-game sweep of the Cardinals, as the Red Sox won their first title in 86 years. His home run came in the first inning of Game 3, off Cardinals starter Jeff Suppan, continuing a streak throughout the Series where the Red Sox scored in the first inning of each game. Ramirez's 2004 season was capped off by being named World Series MVP. Ramirez also finished third in AL MVP voting, just ahead of teammate Ortiz, who finished fourth.\n\nOn May 15, 2005, Ramirez hit his 400th home run off Gil Meche of the Seattle Mariners. On July 5, Ramirez hit his 20th career grand slam — and his third of the season — off Chris Young of the Texas Rangers. On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders in errors, with 7. He posted his highest single season RBI total as a Red Sox in 2005, driving in 144 runs to go along with his 45 homers, but he batted only .292, his first time under .300 since 1998. Along with teammate David Ortiz, who drove in 148 runs, the duo combined to drive in an outstanding 292 runs. Ortiz finished second, and Ramirez fourth, in MVP voting to winner Alex Rodriguez.\n\nOff the field, the season was one of much conflict for Ramirez. Persistent trade rumors (generally involving the New York Mets) dogged him all season. After the Red Sox were eliminated in the first round of that year's playoffs by the eventual World Series champion Chicago White Sox, Ramirez once again expressed a wish to be traded. This included a threat to not show up for spring training if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM Theo Epstein. Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his Ritz-Carlton condominium up for sale. Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly going to the Baltimore Orioles or the New York Mets, but no deal was reached. By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping the demand. His agents, in turn, insisted their client was still open to a trade. But no deal materialized.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, Ramirez became the 31st player in history to hit 450 home runs, with a solo home run off Francisco Cordero of the Texas Rangers. Three weeks later, on July 1, he collected his 2000th hit. Beginning in mid-July, he had a 28-game hitting streak, including 12 multi-hit games, 8 HR, and 28 RBIs. He reached 100 RBI for the 9th consecutive season on August 20 in a series against the Yankees, but missed 28 games from mid-August on with soreness in his right knee. Ramirez finished at .321 with 35 home runs and 102 RBI. He also drew a career high 100 walks in 2006, the only time in his career he reached that mark. However, the Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2002 season.\n\nOn April 22, 2007, Ramirez was the first of four Red Sox batters to homer in consecutive at bats in a game against the New York Yankees pitcher Chase Wright, tying a league record when J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek followed Ramirez with longballs of their own. On April 29, Ramirez became the fifth player to hit 50 career home runs against the Yankees.\n\nRamirez finished 2007 with a .296 batting average, 20 home runs, and 88 RBIs, ending his streak of 30 home run and 100 RBI seasons at 9. His season was cut short when he strained his left oblique in late August during a Yankees series, but he did return to the lineup for the final homestand of the season. In 2007, he had the highest fielding percentage (.990) among left fielders in the AL, tied for second in the major leagues; he was ranked sixth-highest in range factor of all AL left fielders, 1.72, 16th in both leagues, but had the lowest zone rating among MLB left fielders with 100+ games (.713). He made two errors during the 2007 season in left field, and tied for fifth overall in the major leagues in assists from left field.\n\nIn the postseason, Ramirez hit a walk-off three-run home run in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, breaking a 3-3 tie as he launched the ball over Fenway Park's Monster seats beyond the left field wall. In the fourth inning of the series' final game, Ramirez combined with teammate David Ortiz to hit back-to-back home runs off pitcher Jered Weaver. The home run tied him with Bernie Williams for first place all-time in postseason home runs with 22. The Red Sox advanced to the 2007 American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians where, on October 13, Ramirez hit his 23rd postseason home run, passing Williams for the most all-time. He helped the Red Sox to reach and win the 2007 World Series, where they swept the Colorado Rockies, by batting a combined .348 with 4 home runs and 16 RBI in the postseason. Ramirez earned his second World Series ring, as the Red Sox earned their seventh title.\n\n2008 opened with Ramirez and the Red Sox defending their crown, and with Ramirez himself stating he wanted \"to play six more years and then retire as a member of the Red Sox.\" Ramirez played in his 2,000th game on May 26, 2008 against Seattle. On May 31, 2008, Ramirez hit his 500th home run, against Baltimore Orioles pitcher Chad Bradford at Camden Yards in the seventh inning on the first pitch. He became the 24th player in MLB history to do so. He joined two other Boston legends, Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams, to have joined the exclusive home run club as a member of the Red Sox.\n\nA heated altercation between Ramirez and teammate Kevin Youkilis took place on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The \"Boston Globe\" speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez had been slow to join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.\n\nLater in the season, during a series with the Houston Astros, Ramirez had a physical altercation with elderly Red Sox traveling secretary Jack McCormick. The two were arguing over McCormick's inability to fill Ramirez's large game-day request for 16 tickets to the game in Houston. Ramirez pushed the 64-year-old McCormick to the ground after telling him \"Just do your job.\" The two were quickly separated and Ramirez later offered a public apology but did not apologize to McCormick in person until 2014. The matter was dealt with internally, and Ramirez was fined $10,000–15,000.\n\nOn July 25, after sitting out a game against the Seattle Mariners with a sore knee, Ramirez was slated to start against the Yankees. However, several minutes before the game, he informed manager Terry Francona, through a bench coach, that he would not be playing. During the series, Ramirez was directed to an area hospital for MRIs on both his knees; the results showed no damage. When back in action, Ramirez frequently failed to run out ground balls. Assuming that this was due to his displeasure about his contract situation (Ramirez could become a free agent at season's end, but the Red Sox held 2 years of team options they had not yet exercised), many Red Sox fans and reporters, including Dan Shaughnessy of the \"Boston Globe\", called for Ramirez to be traded. Despite all these distractions, Ramirez did continue to hit solidly when on the field, as he batted .299 with 20 home runs and 68 RBI through the first 100 games of the season.\n\nOn July 31, 2008, Ramirez was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way deal. The Boston Red Sox acquired outfielder Jason Bay and minor league infielder Josh Wilson, and the Pittsburgh Pirates got infielder Andy LaRoche and pitching prospect Bryan Morris from the Dodgers and outfielder Brandon Moss and pitcher Craig Hansen from the Red Sox. Ramirez had always worn uniform number 24, but the Dodgers had retired that number in honor of Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston. Ramirez instead chose to wear number 99 with the Dodgers.\n\nAfter going 2-for-4 in his first game as a Dodger, Ramirez never looked back. He hit his first Dodger home run the following day in another 2-for-4 performance. Manny went on to be named the NL Player of the Month for August 2008, touching off \"Mannywood\" in Los Angeles. He hit .415 (44-for-106) with seven doubles, nine home runs, 25 RBIs and 21 runs scored during the month. He finished the season with the Dodgers by batting .396 with 17 home runs and 53 RBI in just 53 games, remarkable numbers for a 36 year old. His combined totals were a .332 batting average, 37 home runs, and 121 RBI.\n\nAmong all major leaguers, Ramirez finished 2008 third in batting average, second in slugging percentage, and third in OPS. With Ramirez in the lineup, the Dodgers won the NL West, then swept the Chicago Cubs in the Division Series before losing in the NLCS to the eventual World Series winning Philadelphia Phillies in five games. During the playoffs, Ramirez hit an astounding .520 with 4 home runs, 2 doubles, 11 walks and 10 RBIs.\n\nRamirez was fourth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, with 138 points, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, and Ryan Braun; this was remarkable for someone who played less than half a season in the NL. After the Dodgers lost in the playoffs, Ramirez, a free agent to be, was asked about his future. \"Gas is up, and so am I\", was his reply, indicating that he expected to be valued highly in the free agent market. After long and contentious negotiations that dragged into the start of spring training, Ramirez signed a two-year $45 million contract to remain with the Dodgers on March 4.\n\nRamirez began 2009 at a highly productive pace as well. Through May 7, he was batting .348 with 6 home runs and 20 RBI. But on that date, Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program established by MLB and the MLB Players Association in 2004. In the announcement by MLB, Ramirez was suspended for unspecified violation of the agreement section 8.G.2. Shortly afterward, Ramirez stated that a physician had unknowingly prescribed a banned medication. After consulting with the players association, Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension. According to an ESPN report, the drug used by Ramirez was human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug typically used by steroid users to restart their body's natural testosterone production as they come off a steroid cycle. It is similar to Clomid, the drug Jason Giambi and others used as clients of BALCO. Testing revealed artificial testosterone, too. As a condition for returning from the suspension, Ramirez was subject to three additional drug tests per year in addition to the minimum of two per player.\n\nDuring his suspension, Ramirez was allowed to work out at the Dodgers' facilities and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. To get back into shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez returned from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez walked into the dugout where he remained the rest of the game.\n\nOn July 21, Ramirez hit his 537th career home run, passing Mickey Mantle for 15th place on the all-time home run list. On July 30, \"The New York Times\" reported that Ramirez tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during Major League Baseball's 2003 survey testing. Ramirez, a member of the Boston Red Sox at the time, was among 104 major league players to test positive.\n\nManny finished 2009 with a .290 batting average, 19 home runs, and 63 RBI in 104 games. He added a home run and 4 RBI in the 2009 MLB postseason (batting .281), but the Dodgers were again eliminated by the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLCS.\n\nOn April 10, 2010, Ramirez recorded his 2,500th career base hit with an infield single against the Florida Marlins. On April 18 against the San Francisco Giants, Ramirez hit his 548th career home run to tie Mike Schmidt for the 14th place on the all-time home run list. He hit his 549th to pass Schmidt on May 28 against the Colorado Rockies. On June 19, he hit a home run in his second game back at Fenway Park.\n\nIn 2010, Ramirez had three separate stints on the disabled list. When he returned from the third trip on August 21, he apparently had lost his starting job to Scott Podsednik. As a pinch hitter, he was ejected on August 29 by home plate umpire Gary Cederstrom one pitch into his at-bat for arguing a strike call. That appearance was his final one in a Dodger uniform. He batted .311 with 8 homers and 40 RBI in only 66 games as a Dodger in 2010 before being placed on waivers.\n\nAfter being placed on waivers by the Dodgers, Ramirez was claimed by the Chicago White Sox. The Dodgers awarded Ramirez to the White Sox on August 30, receiving no prospects, but with the White Sox assuming the $3.8 million remaining on Ramirez's salary. At the time, the White Sox hoped to bolster their offense for a playoff push. However, Ramirez hit .261 with just one home run and two RBI in his 24 games with the White Sox. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season, which ended with the White Sox finishing 88-74, 6 games out of first place in the AL Central, and missing the postseason.\n\nOn January 21, 2011, Ramirez agreed to a one-year, $2 million deal with the Tampa Bay Rays, who also signed his former Red Sox teammate Johnny Damon in a package deal suggested by agent Scott Boras.\n\nThe signing initially looked like a bargain as Ramirez was among the better hitters in spring training, hitting .311 with 3 home runs and 10 RBI. However, the 38-year-old Ramirez abruptly retired on April 8, 2011, after batting .059 (1-for-17) in his first five games with no home runs and a single RBI. Ramirez reportedly tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug in spring training. His first sample, or A sample, was retested and again returned a positive result. Ramirez filed a notice to appeal, and his second sample, or B sample, was tested under observation by Ramirez' representatives. When the B sample also tested positive, he dropped the appeal and told MLB that he would immediately retire.\n\nMLB issued a statement that Ramirez had been informed of an issue under the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment program, and chose to retire rather than continue with the appeal process. Ramirez was facing a 100-game suspension, which would still apply if he decided to return to MLB in the future. Neither Ramirez nor the MLB Players Association issued a statement about the sudden retirement. Ramirez apparently did not personally inform the Rays about his decision. The team announced that they had been informed of his retirement by the MLB Commissioner's Office.\n\nIn September 2011, reports surfaced that Ramirez was planning on playing in the Dominican Winter League for the Cibao Eagles. In a statement, the team said that Ramirez hoped to motivate other MLB stars to play in the country. However, the MLB Commissioner's Office issued a statement that since the Dominican League is affiliated with MLB, Ramirez was not eligible to play without first serving his mandated suspension.\n\nUpon hearing that his plans to play in the winter league would not work, Ramirez decided that he was willing to serve his 100-game suspension for the second violation of the drug policy, and to request reinstatement with MLB. He stated that he was not prepared for retirement, that he was available for any MLB team, and if none showed interest, then he would \"play in Japan or some other place.\"\n\nOn December 4, it was announced that Ramirez had formally filed papers with the league to be reinstated to baseball and that an agreement had been reached between MLB and the Players Association that he needed to serve only a 50-game suspension instead of 100 games.\n\nOn February 20, 2012, Ramirez signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics. The deal called for a $500,000 salary if he made the MLB roster. However, he needed to serve his 50-game suspension before he could play for the team. He was eligible to play on May 30, 2012. With the Sacramento River Cats he hit .302 in 17 games, but had no homers and only a .349 slugging percentage. On June 15, Ramirez requested and was given his outright release by the Athletics.\n\nRamirez played in the Dominican Professional Baseball League during the 2012–13 offseason, registering a .793 OPS for the Águilas Cibaeñas. He signed with the newly renamed EDA Rhinos of the Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan for the 2013 season. He made his debut on March 27 against Brother Elephants. In 49 games, Ramirez batted .352 with eight home runs and 43 RBIs, placing him in the top three in all categories. On June 19, 2013, Ramirez opted out of his contract with the Rhinos, stating that he wanted to be closer to his family.\n\nRamirez signed a minor league deal on July 3, 2013 with the Texas Rangers. He was assigned to the Round Rock Express of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). After noticing a decrease in Ramirez' bat speed, which resulted in a lack of power, the Rangers released Ramirez on August 13.\n\nRamirez signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs on May 25, 2014, to serve as a player-coach for the Iowa Cubs, Chicago's Class AAA affiliate in the PCL.\nRamirez hit a two-run home run in his first Iowa home game at Principal Park on June 30, 2014. Cubs prospects Arismendy Alcántara and Javier Báez credited Ramirez for his help with their swings. Baez also viewed Ramirez as a good mentor because of how Ramirez comforted him after the loss of his uncle. On August 23, Ramirez sustained a knee injury. A week later, Iowa manager Marty Pevey announced that Ramirez was going to Arizona for an MRI. With only four games left in Iowa's season, Pevey said that Ramirez was no longer going to coach and play for the team. Pevey said that he was uncertain about Ramirez plans for the next season, as he thought that Ramirez disliked the travel associated with Class AAA baseball.\n\nOn February 24, 2015, the Cubs announced that Ramirez was hired as a hitting consultant, and that he would split time between Chicago and AAA Iowa. In 2016, Ramirez was a hitting consultant for the Cubs.\n\nOn January 8, 2017, the Kōchi Fighting Dogs of the Japanese Shikoku Island League Plus independent league announced that they had reached an agreement with Ramirez to play for them in 2017. He left the team on August 17 to return to the United States for treatment of a knee injury.\n\nAs of April 2020, Ramirez intends to return to the Chinese Professional Baseball League. He will be 48 years old for the 2020 season.\n\nOn May 10, 2004, Ramirez missed a Red Sox game to become a naturalized citizen of the United States. He entered the next game running onto the field to a standing ovation while carrying a small American flag held in his hand. He planted the flag in the left outfield corner of the field, in the shadow of the Green Monster, where it remained for the entire game.\nRamirez has three sons. Manny Ramirez, Jr. (born 1995) is his son from a previous relationship, while he had Manuelito \"Manny\" Ramirez (born 2003) and Lucas Ramirez (born February 2006) with his wife Juliana. , he and his family reside in Weston, Florida. As of May 2018, Manny Ramirez Jr. is a member of the New Britain Bees, a team in the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.\n\nRamirez has often attracted attention on and off the field for his quirky and often fun-loving behavior and attitude, which is sometimes at odds with MLB's more serious and traditional culture. These incidents are colloquially known as \"Manny Moments\" or, more commonly, \"Manny Being Manny\". Instances of this behavior include inducing his Red Sox teammates, including Ellis Burks, to drink alcohol which he had spiked with Viagra, wearing Oakley THUMP while playing the outfield, disappearing through a door in the Green Monster to use the bathroom, diving to intercept a throw from teammate Johnny Damon in the outfield which had been intended for the infield, selling his barbecue grill on eBay, and high fiving a fan after a catch at the outfield wall before throwing the ball back to the infield to complete a double play. The first known documented usage of the phrase \"Manny Being Manny\" is attributed to then-Indians manager Mike Hargrove, quoted in a 1995 \"Newsday\" article.\n\nRamirez also built a reputation, despite his quirky behavior, of being someone who was a tireless worker at his hitting. He was known for long batting practice and tee sessions as well as constantly reviewing video of his swings and of opposing pitchers. However, while in the batters box during games, he kept his approach extremely simple, relying on the muscle memory and pitch recognition from his training regimen. He was known, at times, to verbally simplify his approach in the batters box to merely \"seeing the ball\".\n\n\n\n\n\nRamirez had been featured on the covers of the Sega Genesis video game \"World Series Baseball '96\" and the EA Sports video game \"MVP Baseball 2005\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2188478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188478", "title": "A Garfield Christmas", "text": "A Garfield Christmas\n\nA Garfield Christmas Special is a 1987 American animated television special based on the \"Garfield\" comic strip, created by Jim Davis. It is directed by Phil Roman and stars Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield the house cat, as well as Thom Huge, Gregg Berger, Julie Payne, Pat Harrington Jr., David L. Lander and Pat Carroll. The special is about Garfield spending Christmas with the Arbuckle family on their farm, and discovering the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nDavis, who wrote the teleplay, cited it as semi-autobiographical. The special was first broadcast December 21, 1987, on CBS and was often rebroadcast in subsequent years at Christmastime: until 2000 (December 14, 2000 was the final CBS broadcast). It was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and has been released on DVD.\n\nThis was the seventh of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.\n\nIn a dream, Garfield is awakened by his owner Jon dressed as an elf, who feeds him a large amount of lasagna before giving him his gift, a robotic Santa Claus which reads minds and produces whatever the user wants. When Jon actually wakes up Garfield, he tells him that it is \"Christmas Eve morning\" and they and Odie are going to the countryside to celebrate Christmas with Jon's family on their farm. Garfield is annoyed that they always go to the farm and the family never comes to Jon's house. During his drive to his family's farm, Jon talks about Christmases he had when he was a boy, with his parents, brother Doc Boy, and Grandma, while Garfield listens with great cynicism.\n\nUpon arriving, Grandma and Garfield quickly grow a special bond. While Jon, Garfield, and Odie take a walk, Grandma spikes Mom's sausage gravy with chili powder, bragging that her sausage gravy just won the Greene County Fair. Jon and Garfield return for dinner, while Odie works on something secretive and then sneaks back into the house. After dinner, they decorate the tree. Jon asks Garfield to put the star on, as no one else can reach the top of the tree. As the family sings Christmas songs, Grandma tells Garfield about her beloved and deceased husband, whom she especially misses at Christmastime because of his unspoken, but obvious, love for the holiday. Afterwards, Mom asks Dad to read a book called \"Binky: The Clown Who Saved Christmas\". Dad is reluctant, as he is tired of reading it every year, but gives in. At night, Garfield notices Odie's suspicious activity and follows him to the barn, seeing Odie making something out of a piece of wood, some wire, a plunger handle, and a hand rake. While there, Garfield stumbles upon some old letters and realizes they must be 50 years old.\n\nOn Christmas morning, just when it seems like all the presents have been opened, Garfield gives Grandma the letters he found in the barn. These letters were love notes written to Grandma by her husband from when they first met each other and married. Garfield also finds out that Odie has been busy making his ultimate Christmas gift: a homemade back scratcher. Garfield gladly thanks and embraces Odie for the gift he made. This is a rare glimpse at Garfield's other side, as Garfield learns one of the true meanings of Christmas: \"It's not the giving, it's not the getting, it's the loving!\"\n\n\n\"Here Comes Garfield\" from the special of the same name can be heard instrumentally when Jon wakes up Garfield from his dream.\n\nIn writing the teleplay, Davis based it on experiences he had celebrating Christmas with his family on their farm in Indiana, with many Arbuckles modeled after Davis family members. Davis' real-life brother was known as Doc Boy. Davis referred to the story as \"very autobiographical,\" adding \"That was \"my\" Christmas on the farm.\" However, he noted Grandma was an entirely fictional character, added for the emotional subplot of having time with loved ones at Christmas.\n\nLorenzo Music, Thom Huge and Gregg Berger reprise their respective roles from past films as Garfield, Jon Arbuckle, and Odie. Julie Payne and Pat Harrington Jr. voice Jon's mother and father, while David L. Lander voices Jon's brother, Doc Boy. Grandma was voiced by Pat Carroll, who at the time was becoming increasingly popular in voice work. After the 1970s, she was working on \"Legends of the Superheroes\" and \"Pound Puppies\".\n\nThe episode first aired on December 21, 1987. According to \"Bustle\", the special was rebroadcast every year until 2000. It often played along with the 1965 \"Peanuts\" special \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\"\n\nIn 2004, \"A Garfield Christmas\" was released on the DVD \"Garfield Holiday Celebrations\", along with \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\" and \"Garfield's Thanksgiving\". It appeared 23rd in TV DVD sales for the week of November 10, 2007. In 2014, \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported copies of the DVD \"were selling on eBay like rare collector's items.\" \"Garfield\" holiday-themed specials, including \"A Garfield Christmas\", were also receiving millions of views on the website YouTube. It was consequently re-released on another DVD compilation, \"The Garfield Holiday Collection\", on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year.\n\nThe special was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program at the 40th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 2004, \"TV Guide\" ranked the special 10th on its 10 Best Family Holiday Specials list. In 2013, Scott Neumyer of \"Parade\" called it \"a delightful little short featuring everyone's favorite cantankerous orange cat.\" That year, Jef Rouner of the \"Houston Press\" described the episode as \"depressing\" and mostly unfunny, remarking that since Grandma cannot hear Garfield's thoughts, \"what we're watching is a sad old widow so desperately lonely without her late husband that she has begun talking out loud to a visiting cat.\" In 2014, Johnny Brayson of \"Bustle\" called it \"a bona fide classic\".\n\n"}

Its headquarters were at Canberra International Airport. On 15 December 2013 the airline was placed in receivership.\n\nBrindabella Airlines was founded by Lara Corry in March 1994 initially as an air charter service. Lara married Jeff Boyd who owned an aircraft maintenance business (WFL Engineering) later that year. The two businesses worked side by side until 2000 when they merged. In 2000, Brindabella Airlines added a flight training school to its operations; and in April 2003 commenced scheduled regional airline services. The flight training school closed in mid-2010.\n\nIn May 2008 Brindabella Airlines introduced BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft. Brindabella took delivery of two J41s in December 2007. The Jetstream aircraft operated primarily on the Brisbane to Tamworth and Canberra to Newcastle routes.\n\nIn 2011 Lara and Jeff Boyd sold the airline to Business Air Holdings Pty Ltd, itself owned by former Grand Prix motorcycle racing competitors Roger Burnett and James Toseland; and Ian Woodley, the Chairman of BMI Regional owner Sector Aviation Holdings. Business Air Holdings also owned Aeropelican Air Services.\n\nIn July 2013 the operations of Aeropelican Air Services and Brindabella were integrated under the Brindabella name. In July 2013 Brindabella entered a codeshare agreement with Qantas.\n\nIn November 2013 the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) grounded four of the airline's aircraft due to overdue engine inspections.

{"id": "2188496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188496", "title": "Schistosoma mansoni", "text": "Schistosoma mansoni\n\nSchistosoma mansoni is a water-borne parasite of humans, and belongs to the group of blood flukes (\"Schistosoma\"). The adult lives in the blood vessels (mesenteric veins) near the human intestine. It causes intestinal schistosomiasis (similar to \"S. japonicum\", \"S. mekongi\", \"S. guineensis\", and \"S. intercalatum\"). Clinical symptoms are caused by the eggs. As the leading cause of schistosomiasis in the world, it is the most prevalent parasite in humans. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. As of 2016, 206.5 million people have schistosomiasis and \"S. mansoni\" is the major parasite. It is found in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname.\n\nUnlike other flukes (trematodes) in which sexes are not separate (monoecious), schistosomes are unique in that adults are divided into males and females, thus, (dioecious). However, the two adults live in permanent partnership, a condition called \"in copula\"; for this, they are considered as hermaphrodites. The life cycle of schistosomes includes two hosts: humans as definitive hosts, where the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction, and snails as intermediate hosts, where a series of asexual reproductive takes place. \"S. mansoni\" is transmitted through water, where freshwater snails of the genus \"Biomphalaria\" act as intermediate hosts. The larvae are able to live in water and infect the hosts by directly penetrating the skin. Prevention of infection is done by improved sanitation and killing the snails. Infection is treated with praziquantel.\n\n\"S. mansoni\" was first noted by Theodor Maximillian Bilharz in Egypt in 1851, while discovering \"S. haematobium\". Sir Patrick Manson identified it as unique species in 1902. Louis Westenra Sambon gave the name \"Schistosomum mansoni\" in 1907 in honour of Manson.\n\nSchistosomes, unlike other trematodes, are long and cylindrical worms. The male \"S. mansoni\" is approximately 1 cm long (0.6–1.1 cm) and is 0.1 cm wide. It is white, and it has a funnel-shaped oral sucker at its anterior end followed by a second pediculated ventral sucker. The external part of the worm is composed of a double bilayer, which is continuously renewed as the outer layer, known as the membranocalyx, and is shed continuously. The tegument bears a large number of small tubercules. The suckers have small thorns in their inner part as well as in the buttons around them. The male genital apparatus is composed of 6 to 9 testicular masses, situated dorsally. There is one deferent canal beginning at each testicle, which is connected to a single deferent that dilates into a reservatory, the seminal vesicle, located at the beginning of the gynaecophoric canal. The copula happens through the coaptation of the male and female genital orifices.\n\nThe female has a cylindrical body, longer and thinner than the male's (1.2 to 1.6 cm long by 0.016 cm wide). It has the general appearance of a roundworm. The female parasite is darker, and it looks gray. The darker color is due to the presence of a pigment (hemozoin) in its digestive tube. This pigment is derived from the digestion of blood. The ovary is elongated and slightly lobulated and is located on the anterior half of the body. A short oviduct conducts to the ootype, which continues with the uterine tube. In this tube it is possible to find 1 to 2 eggs (rarely 3 to 4) but only 1 egg is observed in the ootype at any one time. The genital pore opens ventrally. The posterior two-thirds of the body contain the vittelogenic glands and their winding canal, which unites with the oviduct a little before it reaches the ootype.\n\nThe digestive tube begins at the anterior extremity of the worm, at the bottom of the oral sucker. The digestive tube is composed of an esophagus, which divides in two branches (right and left) and that reunite in a single cecum. The intestines end blindly, meaning that there is no anus.\n\nThe eggs are oval-shaped, measuring 115-175 µm long and 45-47 µm wide, and ~150 µm diameter on average. They have pointed spines towards the broader base on one side, i.e. lateral spines. This is an important diagnostic tool because co-infection with \"S. haematobium\" (having a terminal-spined eggs) is common, and they are hard to distinguish. When the eggs are released into the water, a lot of them are immature and unfertilised so that they do not hatch. When the eggs are larger than 160 µm in diameter, they also fail to hatch.\n\nThe miracidium (from the Greek word μειράκιον, \"meirakion\", meaning youth) is pear-shaped, and gradually elongates as it ages. It measures about 136 μm long and 55 μm wide. The body is covered by anucleate epidermal plates separated by epidermal ridges. The epidermal cells give off numerous hair-like cilia on the body surface. There are 17-22 epidermal cells. Epidermal plate is absent only at the extreme anterior called apical papilla, or terebratorium, which contains numerous sensory organelles. Its internal body is almost fully filled with glycogen particles and vesicles.\n\nThe ceraria has a characteristic bifurcated tail, classically called furcae (Latin for fork); hence, the name (derived from a Greek word κέρκος, \"kerkos\", meaning tail). The tail is highly flexible and its beating propels the ceracaria in water. It is about 0.2 mm long and 47 μm wide, somewhat loosely attached to the main body. The body is pear-shaped and measures 0.24 mm in length and 0.1 mm in width. Its tegument is fully covered with spine. A conspicuous oral sucker is at the apex. As a non-feeding larva, there are no elaborate digestive organs, only oesophagus is distinct. There are three pairs of mucin glands connected to laterally to the oral sucker at the region of the ventral sucker.\n\nDeveloping \"Schistosoma mansoni\" worms that have infected their definitive hosts, prior to the sexual pairing of males and females, require a nutrient source in order to properly develop from cercariae to adults. The developing parasites lyse host red blood cells to gain access to nutrients and also makes its own fungi from its waste it is hard to detect; the hemoglobin and amino acids the blood cells contain can be used by the worm to form proteins. While hemoglobin is digested intracellularly, initiated by salivary gland enzymes, iron waste products cannot be used by the worms, and are typically discarded via regurgitation.\n\nKasschau et al. (1995) tested the effect of temperature and pH on the ability of developing \"S. mansoni\" to lyse red blood cells. The researchers found that the parasites were best able to destroy red blood cells for their nutrients at a pH of 5.1 and a temperature of 37 °C.\n\n\"S. mansoni\" is locomotive in primarily two stages of its life cycle: as cercariae swimming freely through a body of freshwater to locate the epidermis of their human hosts, and as developing and fully-fledged adults, migrating throughout their primary host upon infection. Cercariae are attracted to the presence of fatty acids on the skin of their definitive host, and the parasite responds to changes in light and temperature in their freshwater medium to navigate towards the skin. Ressurreicao et al. (2015) tested the roles of various protein kinases in the ability of the parasite to navigate its medium and locate a penetrable host surface. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase and protein kinase C both respond to changes in medium temperature and light levels, and the stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, associated with recognition of parasite host surface, results in a glandular secretion that deteriorates the host epidermis, and allows the parasite to burrow into its host.\n\nThe parasite's nervous system contains bilobed ganglia and several nerve cords which splay out to every surface of the body; serotonin is a transmitter distributed widely throughout the nervous system and plays an important role in nervous reception, and stimulating mobility.\n\nAfter the eggs of the human-dwelling parasite are emitted in the faeces and into the water, the ripe miracidium hatches out of the egg. The hatching happens in response to temperature, light and dilution of faeces with water. The miracidium searches for a suitable freshwater snail belonging to the genus \"Biomphalaria\". In South America, the principal intermediate host is \"Biomphalaria glabrata\", while \"B. straminea\" and \"B. tenagophila\" are less common. A land snail \"Achatina fulica\" was reported in 2010 to act as a host in Venezuela. In Africa, \"B. glabratra\", \"B. pfeifferi\", \"B. choanomphala\" and \"B. sudanica\" act as the hosts; but in Egypt, the main snail host is \"B. alexandrina\".\n\nMiracidia directly penetrate the soft tissue of snail. Inside the snail, they lose their cilia and develop into mother sporocysts. The sporocysts rapidly multiply by asexual reproduction, each forming numerous daughter sporocysts. The daughter sporocysts move to the liver and gonads of the snail, where they undergo further growth. Within 2–4 weeks, they undergo metamorphosis and give rise to fork-tailed cercariae. Stimulated by light, hundreds of cercariae penetrate out of the snail into water.\n\nThe cercaria emerge from the snail during daylight and they propel themselves in water with the aid of their bifurcated tail, actively seeking out their final host. In water, they can live for up to 12 hours, and their maximum infectivity is between 1 and 9 hours after emergence. When they recognise human skin, they penetrate it within a very short time. This occurs in three stages, an initial attachment to the skin, followed by the creeping over the skin searching for a suitable penetration site, often a hair follicle, and finally penetration of the skin into the epidermis using cytolytic secretions from the cercarial post-acetabular, then pre-acetabular glands. On penetration, the head of the cercaria transforms into an endoparasitic larva, the schistosomule. Each schistosomule spends a few days in the skin and then enters the circulation starting at the dermal lymphatics and venules. Here, they feed on blood, regurgitating the haem as hemozoin. The schistosomule migrates to the lungs (5–7 days post-penetration) and then moves via circulation through the left side of the heart to the hepatoportal circulation (>15 days) where, if it meets a partner of the opposite sex, it develops into a sexually mature adult and the pair migrate to the mesenteric veins. Such pairings are monogamous.\n\nMale schistosomes undergo normal maturation and morphological development in the presence or absence of a female, although behavioural, physiological and antigenic differences between males from single-sex, as opposed to bisex, infections have been reported. On the other hand, female schistosomes do not mature without a male. Female schistosomes from single-sex infections are underdeveloped and exhibit an immature reproductive system. Although the maturation of the female worm seems to be dependent on the presence of the mature male, the stimuli for female growth and for reproductive development seem to be independent from each other.\n\nThe adult female worm resides within the adult male worm's gynaecophoric canal, which is a modification of the ventral surface of the male, forming a groove. The paired worms move against the flow of blood to their final niche in the mesenteric circulation, where they begin egg production (>32 days). The \"S. mansoni\" parasites are found predominantly in the small inferior mesenteric blood vessels surrounding the large intestine and caecal region of the host. Each female lays approximately 300 eggs a day (one egg every 4.8 minutes), which are deposited on the endothelial lining of the venous capillary walls. Most of the body mass of female schistosomes is devoted to the reproductive system. The female converts the equivalent of almost her own body dry weight into eggs each day. The eggs move into the lumen of the host's intestines and are released into the environment with the faeces.\n\n\"Schistosoma mansoni\" has 8 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 16)—7 autosomal pairs and 1 sex pair. The female schistosome is heterogametic, or ZW, and the male is homogametic, or ZZ. Sex is determined in the zygote by a chromosomal mechanism. The genome is approximately 270 MB with a GC content of 34%, 4–8% highly repetitive sequence, 32–36% middle repetitive sequence and 60% single copy sequence. Numerous highly or moderately repetitive elements are identified, with at least 30% repetitive DNA. Chromosomes range in size from 18 to 73 MB and can be distinguished by size, shape, and C banding.\n\nIn 2000, the first BAC library of Schistosome was constructed. In June 2003, a ~5x whole genome shotgun sequencing project was initiated at the Sanger Institute. Also in 2003, 163,000 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) were generated (by a consortium headed by the University of São Paulo) from six selected developmental stages of this parasite, resulting in 31,000 assembled sequences and an estimated 92% of the 14,000-gene complement.\n\nIn 2009 the genomes of both \"S. mansoni\" and \"S. japonicum\" were published, with each describing 11,809 and 13,469 genes, respectively. \"S. mansoni\" genome has increased protease families and deficiencies in lipid anabolism; which are attributed its parasitic adaptation. Portease included the invadolysin (host penetration) and cathepsin (blood-feeding) gene families.\n\nIn 2012, an improved version of the \"S. mansoni\" genome was published, which consisted of only 885 scaffolds and more than 81% of the bases organised into chromosomes.\n\nSchistosome eggs, which may become lodged within the hosts tissues, are the major cause of pathology in schistosomiasis. Some of the deposited eggs reach the outside environment by passing through the wall of the intestine; the rest are swept into the circulation and are filtered out in the periportal tracts of the liver, resulting in periportal fibrosis. Onset of egg laying in humans is sometimes associated with an onset of fever (Katayama fever). This \"acute schistosomiasis\" is not, however, as important as the chronic forms of the disease. For \"S. mansoni\" and \"S. japonicum\", these are \"intestinal\" and \"hepatic schistosomiasis\", associated with formation of granulomas around trapped eggs lodged in the intestinal wall or in the liver, respectively. The hepatic form of the disease is the most important, granulomas here giving rise to fibrosis of the liver and hepatosplenomegaly in severe cases. Symptoms and signs depend on the number and location of eggs trapped in the tissues. Initially, the inflammatory reaction is readily reversible. In the latter stages of the disease, the pathology is associated with collagen deposition and fibrosis, resulting in organ damage that may be only partially reversible.\n\nGranuloma formation is initiated by antigens secreted by the miracidium through microscopic pores within the rigid egg shell, and the immune response to granuloma, rather than the direct action of egg antigens, causes the symptoms. The granulomas formed around the eggs impair blood flow in the liver and, as a consequence, induce portal hypertension. With time, collateral circulation is formed and the eggs disseminate into the lungs, where they cause more granulomas, pulmonary arteritis and, later, cor pulmonale. A contributory factor to portal hypertension is Symmers' fibrosis, which develops around branches of the portal veins. This fibrosis occurs only many years after the infection and is presumed to be caused in part by soluble egg antigens and various immune cells that react to them.\n\nRecent research has shown that granuloma size is consistent with levels of IL-13, which plays a prominent role in granuloma formation and granuloma size. IL-13 receptor α 2 (IL-13Rα2) binds IL-13 with high affinity and blocks the effects of IL-13. Thus, this receptor is essential in preventing the progression of schistosomiasis from the acute to the chronic (and deadly) stage of disease. Synthetic IL-13Rα2 given to mice has resulted in significant decreases in granuloma size, implicating IL-13Rα2 as an important target in schistosomiasis.\n\n\"S. mansoni\" infection often occurs alongside those of viral hepatitis, either hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). This is due to high prevalence of schistosomiasis in areas where chronic viral hepatitis is prevalent. One important factor was the development of large reservoir of infection due to extensive schistosomiasis control programs that used intravenously administered tartar emetic since the 1960s. Co-infection is known to cause earlier liver deterioration and more severe illness.\n\nAdult and larval worms migrate through the host's blood circulation avoiding the host's immune system. The worms have many tools that help in this evasion, including the tegument, antioxidant proteins, and defenses against host membrane attack complex (MAC). The tegument coats the worm and acts as a physical barrier to host antibodies and complement. Host immune defenses are capable of producing superoxide, but these are counterattacked by antioxidant proteins produced by the parasite. Schistosomes have four superoxide dismutases, and levels of these proteins increase as the schistosome grows. Antioxidant pathways were first recognised as a chokepoints for schistosomes, and later extended to other trematodes and cestodes. Targeting of this pathway with different inhibitors of the central antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) results in reduced viability of worms. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) protein is present on the parasite tegument and protects host cells by blocking formation of MAC. In addition, schistosomes have six homologues of human CD59 which are strong inhibitors of MAC.\n\nThe presence of \"S. mansoni\" is detected by microscopic examination of parasite eggs in stool. A staining method called Kato-Katz technique is used for stool examination. It involves methylene blue-stained cellophane soaked in glycerine or glass slides. A bit costlier technique called formalin-ether concentration technique (FECT) is often used in combination with the direct faecal smear for higher accuracy. Serological and immunological tests are also available. Antibodies and antigens can be detected in the blood using ELISA to identify infection. Adult worm antigens can be detected by indirect haemagglutination assays (IHAs). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also used for detecting the parasite DNA. Circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine can be tested with lateral flow immune-chromatographic reagent strip and point-of-care (POC) tests.\n\nEgg detection and immunologic tests are not that sensitive. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based testing is accurate and rapid. They, however, are not frequency used in countries were the disease is common due to the cost of the equipment and the technical experience required to run them. Using a microscope to detect eggs costs about US$0.40 per test well PCR is about $US7 per test as of 2019. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are being studied as they are lower cost. LAMP testing is not commercially available as of 2019.\n\nThe standard drug for \"S. mansoni\" infection is praziquantel at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Oxamniquine is also used.\n\nAs of WHO report in 2016, 206.5 million people worldwide are having schistosomiasis due to different species of \"Schistosoma\". More than 88 million people were given medical treatment. \"S. mansoni\" is the major species. It is endemic in 55 countries and most prevalent in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname. About 80-85% of schistosomiasis is found in sub-Saharan Africa, where \"S. haematobium\", \"S. intercalatum\" and \"S. mansoni\" are endemic. Approximately 393 million Africans are at risk of infection from \"S. mansoni\", of which about 55 million are infected at any moment. Annual death due to \"S. mansoni\" is about 130,000. The prevalence rate in different countries of Africa are: 73.9% in northern Ethiopia, 37.9% in western Ethiopia, 56% in Nigeria, 60.5% in Kenya, 64.3% in Tanzania, 19.8% in Ghana, and 53.8% in Côte d'Ivoire. In Egypt, 60% of the population in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Nile Delta and only 6% in the Southern part are infected.\n\n\"S. mansoni\" is commonly found in places with poor sanitation. Because of the parasite's fecal-oral transmission, bodies of water that contain human waste can be infectious. Water that contains large populations of the intermediate host snail species is more likely to cause infection. Young children living in these areas are at greatest risk because of their tendency to swim and bathe in cercaria-infected waters longer than adults\n. Anyone travelling to the areas described above, and who is exposed to contaminated water, is at risk of schistosomiasis.\n\nThe intermediate hosts \"Biomphalaria\" snails are estimated to originate in South America 95-110 million years ago. But the parasites \"Schistosoma\" originated in Asia. In Africa, the progenitor species evolved into modern \"S. mansoni\" and \"S. haematobium\" around 2-5 million years ago. It reached Egypt via infected slaves and baboons from the Land of Punt through migrations that occurred possibly as early as the V Dynasty (\"c\". 2494–2345 BCE).\n\nA German physician Theodor Maximillian Bilharz was the first to discover the parasite in 1851, while working at Kasr el-Aini Hospital, a medical school in Cairo. Bilharz recovered them from autopsies of dead soldiers, and noticed two distinct parasites. He described one of them as \"Distomum haematobium\" (now \"S. haematobium\") in 1852, but failed to identify the other. In one of his letters to his mentor Karl Theordor von Siebold, he mentioned some of the eggs were different in having terminal spines while some had lateral spines. Terminal-spined eggs are unique to \"S. haematobium\", while lateral spines are found only in \"S. mansoni\". Bilharz also noted that the adult flukes were different in anatomy and number eggs they produced. He introduced the terms bilharzia and bilharziasis for the name of the infection in 1856. A German zoologist David Friedrich Weinland corrected the genus name to \"Schistosoma\" in 1858; and introduced the disease name as schistosomiasis.\n\nThe species distinction was first recognised by Patrick Manson at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Manson identified lateral-spined eggs in the faeces of a colonial officer earlier posted to the West Indies, and concluded that there were two species of \"Schistosoma\". An Italian-British physician Louis Westenra Sambon gave the new names \"Schistosomum haematobium\" and \"Schistosomum mansoni\" in 1907, the latter to honour Manson. Sambon only gave partial description using a male worm. In 1908, a Brazilian physician Manuel Augusto Pirajá da Silva gave a complete description of male and female worms, including the lateral-spined eggs. Pirajá da Silva obtained specimens from three necropsies and eggs from 20 stool examinations in Bahia. He gave the name \"S. americanum\". The species identity was confirmed in 1907 by British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper, identifying the specific snail host, and distinguishing the egg structure, thereby establishing the life cycle.\n\n"}

His rocky childhood, southern heritage, and interest in literature influenced his work greatly. After losing everything in a failed rice-growing venture in 1910, his family was forced to relocate to New Orleans where Laughlin's father found work in a factory. Laughlin was an introverted child with few friends and a close relationship with his father, who cultivated and encouraged his lifelong love of literature and whose death in 1918 devastated his son.\n\nAlthough he dropped out of high school in 1920 after having barely completed his first year, Laughlin was an educated and highly literate man. His large vocabulary and love of language are evident in the elaborate captions he later wrote to accompany his photographs. He initially aspired to be a writer and wrote many poems and stories in the style of French symbolism, most of which remained unpublished.\n\nLaughlin discovered photography when he was 25 and taught himself how to use a simple 2½ by 2¼ view camera. He began working as a freelance architectural photographer and was subsequently employed by agencies as varied as Vogue Magazine and the US government. Disliking the constraints of government work, Laughlin eventually left Vogue after a conflict with then-editor Edward Steichen. Thereafter, he worked almost exclusively on personal projects utilizing a wide range of photographic styles and techniques, from simple geometric abstractions of architectural features to elaborately staged allegories utilizing models, costumes, and props. Through this period one of his favorite models was Dody Weston Thompson who went on to become a notable photographer in her own right. \n\nLaughlin’s personal projects and large collection of images focused mostly on places and the architecture located there. His most well known works focus on New Orleans, but he also photographed in Chicago, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis, San Antonio, and Little Rock. With the photobook being the ultimate goal and measure for success for photographers, Laughlin achieved this in 1948 when Ghosts Along the Mississippi: The Magic of the Old Houses of Louisiana was first published. The book features 100 black and white images of photographs that are focused around the architecture of the south during the plantation era. Through this book, Laughlin was interested in representing the lengthy history of Louisiana and the feeling of life there, while also recognizing the history of slavery as well as the imaginary situations that he created. \n\nHe died on 2 January 1985 in New Orleans, leaving behind a massive collection of books and images. Thanks to the 17,000 negatives that he preserved, his work continues to be shown around the United States and Europe. Laughlin's library, comprising over 30,000 volumes, was purchased by Louisiana State University in 1986. The collection's focus in on science fiction, fantasy, mystery and the macabre. Other subjects represented include 20th-century art and design, European and American architecture, photography, Victoriana, humor, sex and sexuality, psychology, spiritualism, and the occult.\n\nLaughlin is buried in Paris's Père Lachaise Cemetery in grave 18223.\n\nMany historians credit Laughlin as being the first true surrealist photographer in the United States. His images are often nostalgic, reflecting the influence of Eugène Atget and other photographers who tried to capture vanishing urban landscapes. \n\nA pair of surrealistic photographs of parts on a 1939 Ford, in which the photographer's reflection as he took the pictures could be seen, were showcased in 2013 on an episode of Antiques Roadshow set in Baton Rouge, LA, and attributed to Clarence John Laughlin. The man who brought the photographs to the Roadshow knew Laughlin's son, and saw the photos hanging at the son's place of business. In order to acquire them, the man traded automobile repairs and various parts, first for one, then for the other. Their retail value, as a pair, was appraised at $7,000 to $9,000, although the owner indicated that he thought they were priceless.\n\n"}

It targeted homosexual contacts between Navy personnel and the civilian population. Initially, it attracted little public notice, but the investigation—with its methods and use of enlisted personnel—and subsequent trial, eventually attracted national news coverage and provoked a congressional investigation, which ended with Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future US President) Franklin Roosevelt being rebuked by a Congressional committee.\n\nIn February 1919, Thomas Brunelle and Chief Machinist's Mate Ervin Arnold were both patients at the Naval Training Station hospital, in Newport. Brunelle told Arnold the details of the subculture to which he belonged in Newport, centered at the Army and Navy YMCA and the Newport Art Club, where local civilian homosexuals regularly made contact with one another and with naval personnel. Arnold undertook a personal investigation to verify Brunelle's account and documented his findings. He then presented his Navy superiors with detailed reports of effeminate behavior, cross-dressing, and parties involving sexual activity, liquor and cocaine.\n\nEventually, Admiral Spencer S. Wood, commander of the 2nd Naval District, ordered a thorough investigation and created a court of inquiry to review Arnold’s claims. On March 19, 1919, the court concluded that a thorough investigation was warranted. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt, who was 37, approved the court's recommendation and asked Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to undertake the investigation.\n\nWhen Palmer declined to dedicate resources to such an investigation, Arnold, a former Connecticut state detective, was placed in charge of the work. With an infiltration approach in mind, he chose his investigators on the basis of their youth and looks. Over a period of several weeks, 13 such agents submitted daily reports to Arnold that included candid descriptions of homosexual acts and their participation in them. They rarely reported any hesitancy or qualms about their direct participation. \n\nArrests began on April 4, and by April 22, fifteen sailors had been arrested. Each was brought before a military tribunal and heard men whom they recognized as former sexual partners provide graphic testimony of their encounters. Older naval officers were confounded by the terms used by the investigators. Once the operatives had presented their evidence before the court, the accused were encouraged to incriminate others and many did so, in hopes of leniency. Brunelle incriminated some but withheld the names of his closest friends.\n\nThe three-week military trial ended with the court-martial of 17 sailors charged with sodomy and \"scandalous conduct.\" Most were sent to the naval prison at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. Two more were dishonorably discharged and two others were found innocent with no further action.\n\n\"The Providence Journal\", under publisher John R. Rathom, covered the trial proceedings daily, often with a critical eye toward the prosecution's case. On January 8, 1920, Rev. Samuel Neal Kent, an Episcopal clergyman, was found not guilty on all charges. In his charge to the jury in that case, the judge was at pains to discredit the witnesses who described their participation in illicit sexual acts. He reasoned that since no military or governmental authority could legitimately order them to participate in such acts against their will, either they were willing participants, whose complaints were groundless, or they were acting under the compulsion of unlawful commands, on the part of their superiors. His analysis fueled opposition in Newport's religious community.\n\nWithin days, a committee of Newport clergymen drafted a lengthy letter to President Woodrow Wilson denouncing the Navy's activities in Newport, specifically the \"deleterious and vicious methods\" used, including keeping those charged confined for months without trial. Among the signatories were Rev. William Safford Jones of Channing Church, Rev. J. Howard Deming, Rev. Everett P. Smith of St. Mary's Church, Portsmouth, and Rev. Richard Arnold Greene of Newport.\n\nThe \"Providence Journal\" published the letter, which put the Navy on the defensive and named Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Roosevelt. Assistant Secretary Roosevelt angrily charged that press coverage like Rathom's would damage the Navy's reputation to the point that parents would not allow their sons to enlist. Also at issue, however, were the methods employed in the investigation. Rathom and Roosevelt had a \"tart exchange of telegrams\" disputing whether anyone in the naval hierarchy in Washington had supervised the investigation closely or authorized the actual participation of investigators in illicit acts.\n\nWhile investigations dragged, Roosevelt resigned from his position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy in July 1920 when he accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for vice president. He and presidential candidate James M. Cox were on the losing end of Warren G. Harding's landslide victory that year.\n\nOn July 19, 1921, a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs denounced both Daniels and Roosevelt for the methods used in the Newport investigations. \"The New York Times\" reported that most of the details of the affair were \"of an unprintable nature\" but explained that the committee believed that Daniels and Roosevelt knew that \"enlisted men of the navy were used as participants in immoral practices for the purpose of obtaining evidence.\"\n\nThe committee report declared that using enlisted men in this way \"violated the code of the American citizen and ignored the rights of every American boy who enlisted in the navy to fight for his country.\" The committee report also made public the earlier determination of a naval court-martial. To the court'-martial's assessment that Roosevelt's behavior was \"unfortunate and ill-advised,\" the committee added \"reprehensible.\" Daniels's rejection of the court's judgment, the committee declared, \"is to be severely condemned.\"\n\nGiven how difficult all concerned found to discuss the details of the crimes at issue, their language characterizes the questionable activities repeatedly without ever specifying the actions themselves. They refer to a \"lack of moral perspective\" and invoked the youth of the navy personnel: \"Conduct of a character at which seasoned veterans of the service would have shuddered was practically forced upon boys.\" Their most explicit description said that the navy personnel allowed \"to be performed upon them immoral acts.\" Also, the committee wrote that for Daniels and Roosevelt to allow personnel to be placed in a position in which the acts were even liable to occur, was \"a deplorable, disgraceful, and most \"unnatural\" proceeding.\" Finally, the committee acknowledged that naval officials were facing a serious problem in Newport, and it denounced \"immoral conditions\" that were \"a menace to both the health and the morale of the men in the naval training station.\"\n\nRoosevelt rejected the report, noting that the subcommittee's two Republican members had condemned him while the one Democrat issued a minority report. He contested many details and interpretations in the committee's report, and then went on the attack: \"This business of using the navy as a football of politics has got to stop.\" He had nothing to say about the court-martial's assessment.\n\nAny damage to Roosevelt's political prospects paled when he was stricken with a paralytic illness while vacationing in August 1921 at Campobello Island in Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188595", "title": "William Dudley Chipley", "text": "William Dudley Chipley\n\nWilliam Dudley Chipley (June 6, 1840 – December 1, 1897) was an American railroad executive and politician who was instrumental in the building of the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad and was a tireless promoter of Pensacola, his adopted city, where he was elected to one term as mayor, and later to a term as Florida state senator.\n\nFollowing the American Civil War, in 1868 Chipley was one of twenty men arrested in his hometown of Columbus, Georgia, in 1868 on suspicion of participation in the murder of Radical Republican judge George W. Ashburn by the Ku Klux Klan. Political maneuvers resulted in the dropping of all charges.\n\nIn 1877, Chipley helped Texas Rangers and Florida law officers subdue and arrest outlaw John Wesley Hardin aboard a train in Pensacola. Hardin was subsequently returned to Texas, convicted on outstanding murder charges, and imprisoned.\n\nChipley was born in Columbus, Georgia, the son of Dr. William Stout Chipley and Elizabeth Fannin Chipley. Chipley's grandfather, the Rev. Stephen Chipley, was one of the founding citizens of Lexington, Kentucky. Dr. Chipley was renowned for his work relating to brain diseases and held two jobs: a professor of medicine at Transylvania University and the warden of the Eastern Asylum for the Insane in Lexington.\n\nChipley moved with his parents back to Lexington when he was four years old, and was raised for all of his formative years in Kentucky. He graduated from the Kentucky Military Institute and Transylvania University.\n\nAfter graduation from Transylvania, he enlisted in the 9th Kentucky Infantry, fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He was elevated to the position of lieutenant colonel and was wounded at the battles of Shiloh and Chickamauga before being taken prisoner at the Battle of Peachtree Creek near Atlanta. As a prisoner of war, Chipley was transported to Johnson's Island on Lake Erie in Ohio, and was interned there until the war was over. In mid-1865, he settled in Columbus and married Ann Elizabeth Billups, the daughter of a prominent planter in Phenix City, Alabama, just across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus.\nChipley was later implicated and charged in the murder of George W. Ashburn by the Columbus Ku Klux Klan. Ashburn, a Radical Republican member of the Georgia government, was murdered on March 31, 1868, following warnings by the KKK to cease his outspoken support for Reconstruction. In the resultant investigation into his murder, Chipley was identified by witness Amanda Patterson as one of several men who broke into the house Ashburn was staying in; Patterson also told investigators that Chipley had, prior to the murder, told her \"We are going to kill old Ashburn the night of the day he speaks [at a political meeting].\"\n\nWith former Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens representing the defense, Chipley and his alleged co-conspirators were tried before a military court (a civil court not being used as a result of Georgia's temporary military governorship). The prosecution, aided by federal investigator Hiram C. Whitley, assembled evidence of guilt to the point that sympathetic Southern newspapers switched from outright denial of Klan guilt to diminishing the status of the crime; as the \"Macon Weekly Telegraph\" hypothesized, perhaps the defendants had intended only to tar and feather Ashburn but when he resisted, the Klan members shot him in \"quasi self-defense.\" Northern newspapers reported the defense as resorting to tedious details in their attempt to clear the accused, with the \"Chicago Tribune\" recording the military judges as \"growing somewhat weary of the great mass of trifling and irrelevant matter introduced by the defense.\" \n\nPolitical intrigue, however, would ultimately undermine the case against Chipley and the other defendants. Stephens' connections with Democratic members of the Georgia House of Representatives lead to Democrats voting to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, a Republican goal, which in turn caused the re-admittance of Georgia to the Union and the invalidation of the military court proceedings. As a result, Chipley and the others charged in Ashburn's death were released.\n\nChipley entered the railroad industry shortly after the Ashburn trial. He worked for the Columbus and Rome Railroad, and later for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from 1873 to 1876. It was at this time that he moved to Pensacola, Florida, where he was made general manager of the Pensacola Railroad, a 45-mile line linking Pensacola with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, its parent company from 1880 onward. Chipley was also instrumental in the promoting and building of L&N subsidiary Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad in 1881-1883, linking Pensacola and the Florida Panhandle with the eastern part of the state for the first time. Chipley was made vice-president of the P&A.\n\nChipley's success in getting a railroad built through the Panhandle led the residents of Orange, Florida, to rename their town Chipley in 1882. In the same year, the town of Chipley, Georgia, near Columbus, was named for him, after he got the tracks of the Columbus and Rome Railroad extended to that community; the town's name was changed to Pine Mountain in 1958.\n\nChipley created the Democratic Executive Committee in Muscogee County, Georgia in the late 1860s, and was its first director. He later served as director of the Florida Democratic Executive Committee.\n\nChipley served one term as the mayor of Pensacola (1887–1888). He also served in the Florida State Senate from 1895 to 1897, and lost his bid for United States Senator in 1896 by one vote.\n\nWhile on a trip to Washington, D.C., Chipley died on December 1, 1897. He was in the middle of a trip to lobby lawmakers to base more industrial endeavors in Florida. He was buried in Columbus, while the townspeople of Pensacola erected an obelisk in the Plaza Ferdinand VII in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}

Some of the wooden elements, if not all, are attached to one another with screws. The chunks and twigs are most evident at the top and sides of the structure. The majority of stacked slabs sit at eye level and downward, implying an impending collapse of the foundation. The natural surface of the wooden pieces and screws have been altered with black paint. Upon closer look, some of the wooden elements reveal their original caramel-toned pigment. The placement of each component is very deliberate. The composition of the work reads balanced and harmonious than that of natural destruction. Deep inside of the work, surprising elements appear such as toothy slabs. These thin pieces have split in some sort of methodical yet haphazard manner, revealing potential visual representations of teeth, piano keys, or city skylines.\n\nRepetition is routinely employed in the placement of materials except for two notable instances. Close to the bottom left of the artwork there is a misshapen slab with a nearly perfect circle-shaped cutaway. Upon close investigation, this negative circle space appears imperfect, implying possible organic origins. The circle detail is unique to the piece. The other notable eccentricity is a long stick at the top right portion of the work. It protrudes far more than any other element, almost disquietingly so in its exaggerated gesture. Many juxtapositions exist within this form, perhaps most prominently the twigs and stumps placed methodically against stacked machine-cut wooden slabs.\n"}

When he was ten years old, he went to work as an apprentice to his uncle, William Dunlap, a printer and bookseller in Philadelphia. In 1766, William Dunlap left the business in the care of his nephew. John eventually bought the business, and at first made a living by printing sermons and probably broadsides and handbills too. In November 1771, Dunlap began the publication of the \"Pennsylvania Packet, or General Advertiser\", a weekly newspaper. In 1773 he married Elizabeth Hayes Ellison.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Dunlap became an officer in the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry, and saw action with George Washington at the battles of Trenton and Princeton. He continued in the First City Troop after the war, rising to the rank of major, and leading Pennsylvania's cavalry militia to help suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.\n\nIn 1776, Dunlap secured a lucrative printing contract for the Continental Congress. In July 1776, fighting between the American colonists and the British forces had been going on for over a year. On July 2, the Second Continental Congress voted on the Lee Resolution to secede. Two days later, they approved the final wording of a public declaration regarding their decision, which we today call the Declaration of Independence. President of Congress John Hancock signed the fair copy with Secretary of Congress Charles Thomson attesting it. That evening Hancock ordered Dunlap to print broadside copies of the declaration. Dunlap printed perhaps 200 broadsides, since known as the Dunlap broadsides, which were the first published versions of the Declaration.\n\nDunlap also printed items for Pennsylvania's revolutionary government. In 1777 he took over the printing of the \"Journals of the Continental Congress\" from Robert Aitken, but lost the contract in 1779 after printing in his newspaper a letter from Thomas Paine that leaked news of the secret French aid to the Americans.\n\nIn 1784, Dunlap's paper became a daily with a new title: the \"North American and United States Gazette.\" It was not the first daily in the United States—the \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" was the first in 1783—but it became the first successful daily.\n\nContinuing to serve the changing needs of the government, Dunlap and his partner David Claypoole printed the Constitution of the United States September 19, 1787 for use by the Constitutional Convention, and later published it for the first time in \"The Pennsylvania Packet\".\n\nDunlap's major financial success came from real estate speculation. During the American Revolution, he bought property confiscated from Loyalists who refused to take Pennsylvania's new loyalty oath. After the war, he bought land in Kentucky. By 1795, when he was forty-eight, he was able to retire with a sizable estate. Retirement did not agree with him, however; according to his friend, Dr. Benjamin Rush, Dunlap became a drunkard in his final years. He died in Philadelphia.\n\n"}

The film stars Val Kilmer, Gabriel Byrne, Vinnie Jones, Patrick Bergin, Joanne Whalley, Bruno Kirby (in his final film), Anthony LaPaglia, Roy Dotrice, Patsy Kensit, Andy Nyman and Mick Rossi.\n\nOriginally intended to be a short, the film was shot without the use of a scripted screenplay and the director (Sean Stanek) allowed the actors to improvise a majority of dialogue as he shot the scenes. The picture was shot on location in London and Los Angeles and took three years to complete.\n\nThe story opens in Los Angeles with Dillon (Val Kilmer) who receives a phone call from Ray Burns (Mick Rossi) who has just been shot and desperately needs help. Dillon is a cleaner for a gangster named Eddie (Gabriel Byrne) and has been sent to assist Ray should he require it. After a colorful opening title sequence which follows Dillon's drive to the house, he finds Ray almost bleeding to death on a sofa. Removing all of the evidence, Dillon leaves carrying Ray to his car but not before he torches the house, destroying any evidence of Ray's presence. As Dillon and Ray drive away, Dillon struggles to keep Ray conscious and relates to him a story of a humorous encounter with a Mexican auto mechanic, which coins one of the catchphrases of the film: \"I'm not gonna taco\".\n\nThe story then flashes back to eight years earlier and introduces Riley (Patrick Bergin) as he admires some artwork in a London gallery. He receives a call on his cell phone from the crooked Detective Brice (Vinnie Jones), who informs Riley that there is a shipment of heroin coming in, and that he wants Riley to get a team together and steal it for him. Riley agrees to the job and tells Brice that he has just the man to do it, a petty thief named Ray Burns. Riley gives a menacing stare to the gallery attendant (Caspar von Winterfeldt) in one of the films funnier moments before leaving to meet with Ray.\n\nAfter they discuss the details of the job at hand, Ray agrees to do the job and meets up with his team, which consists of Nathan (Sean Power) and Terry Rawlings (Trevor Nugent) son of infamous moblord Jack Rawlings (Roy Dotrice) and Terry's girlfriend, Cindy (Patsy Kensit). Together they begin plotting the heist: Nathan will go up to the roof and act as lookout while Ray and Terry break into the warehouse to steal the heroin. Unfortunately, during the heist, Nathan loses his footing and tumbles to his death, falling through a skylight and triggering an alarm, alerting the guards. Ray and Terry manage to escape with the drugs, but lose contact with each other. \n\nShortly thereafter, Brice calls Riley to inform him that the heist went terribly wrong, and that Nathan is dead. To cover his own tracks, he tells Riley to find a scapegoat, and Riley immediately names Ray. Meanwhile, Ray, who has gone into hiding, tries to call Terry but doesn't get an answer. He turns to Riley to find out what happened. Riley tells Ray that Nathan is dead and that Scotland Yard is looking for him, omitting the fact that Terry has handed over the drugs and that Brice is behind the whole heist. Ray decides he needs to disappear for a while and attempts to go underground, but before he can do so the police pick him up on an anonymous tip from Brice. Ray is convicted for the robbery and the manslaughter of Nathan, and is subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nRay serves his time, but has no contact with the outside world, denying even his closest lover and girlfriend Maggie (Joanne Whalley) a visit. He also learns by reading the paper that Terry has died of a drug overdose. Saddened by the news, Ray vows to get revenge on Brice and Riley as soon as he is free.\n\nWhile Ray is serving time, Riley and Brice continue their crooked ways, and Brice informs Riley that he has an incriminating video tape of London Charlie (Steve Jones) that could be worth some cash. He dispatches Riley to Los Angeles to blackmail London Charlie. Riley arrives in Los Angeles along with his girlfriend Samantha Fay (Sile Bermingham) in order to pick up the cash from Brice. Meanwhile, Ray is released from prison and contacted by London Charlie, who realizes that the only way he can escape his dilemma is to have Riley terminated. He knows Ray is out to avenge his time in prison and so pays him $100,000 to come to Los Angeles. Brice, aware of Ray's release and suspicious that he may be up to something, instructs an underling, Danny, (Andy Nyman) to keep an eye on him and find out what he can about his plans. Danny confronts Ray in a busy London street and brings the situation to a head when he makes a comment about Ray's former girlfriend Maggie, whom Ray has not seen since he went to prison. Ray angrily headbutts Danny, telling him to leave him alone. Danny reports this back to Brice, who still believes Ray is up to something. \n\nRay is soon contacted by Jack Rawlings, Terry's father, who beckons him to come and visit. The two have a long talk about Terry and Ray tells Jack how sorry he is for Terry's death. Jack feigns compassion and tells Ray that he wants him to go after the guy who set them up, namely Riley, and gives him a contact in Los Angeles, Eddie, who can help him with the job. Ray is to pick up $100,000 at Jack's club from Big Frankie (Adam Fogerty) and then get on a plane to Los Angeles to hunt Riley down.\n\nUpon arrival, Ray immediately goes to London Charlie's house (which is revealed to be the one seen in the beginning of the film) to meet with him. Ray is told that there is $100,000 in a bag that he is to take to Riley and use to recover the tape. Once he has the tape, Ray is to kill Riley and bring the tape back to London Charlie. Ray leaves and begins to cover his tracks by checking into two separate motels. He then makes a call to Eddie to pick up a car for use in Los Angeles. That night he picks up the car and meets Eddie, who is waiting for him in the back seat. Eddie tells him there is a pistol in the glove box and that he doesn't want to get involved in any of the nasty business. Ray acknowledges the request and takes off into the night.\n\nThe next day, Riley is waiting to meet with London Charlie. He is surprised by Ray, who shows up at his door carrying a bag of cash. Ray has hidden the pistol outside of the apartment and so is clean when he is frisked by Riley. The two have a heated discussion about what happened eight years ago and Riley makes light of Terry's death, much to Ray's chagrin. Ray gives the bag of cash to Riley, who angrily informs him that the amount is only half of what he and London Charlie had agreed to, and ordering him to get him the rest if he wants the tape. Ray exits the apartment, retrieves his pistol, then goes back inside and demands the tape from Riley at gunpoint. Riley refuses, and Ray shoots him once in the chest, then once in the back of the head, killing him.\n\nRay searches the apartment for the tape, but only finds a key to a room at a nearby hotel. Ray returns to his first hotel to wash Riley's blood off of himself before he goes to check out the other hotel. Meanwhile, police are investigating the shooting death at Riley's apartment. Detective Allen (Bruno Kirby) arrives on the crime scene and discovers that there is a link to a nearby hotel—the same hotel Ray is also heading to. Detective Bartow (Mark Siciliani) and Officer Chris Anders (Aaron Gallagher) are dispatched to investigate. At the hotel they find Samantha Fay, who is startled by their appearance. When the officers inform her that there has been an incident and they need to take her to the station to answer some questions, she reluctantly agrees. Officer Anders escorts her out, leaving Detective Bartow to search the room. Ray arrives as they are leaving, running into Bartow as he attempts to enter the room. Ray attempts to keep his cool, especially when Bartow tells him he is a police officer. He questions Ray as to how he knew Riley, and Ray innocently says they recently met and that they had arranged to grab a drink. Bartow is suspicious and asks Ray if he would have any objections to coming down to the station for some questioning. Ray has no choice but to agree, and they leave together. \n\nAt the station, Ray and Samantha are questioned for hours and hours by Detective Allen and Detective Drummond (Anthony LaPaglia). The situation is tense, and they both have a tough time keeping calm. Eventually they are both let go, but not before Samantha is told that Riley is dead. Both leave the station within a couple of hours of each other and head in different directions, Ray to pick up his things at the second motel, and Samantha to pick up the tape and a gun which Riley had left in a safety deposit box earlier that day. Samantha then heads to London Charlie's house to square things away with him and avenge Riley's death. She shoots London Charlie dead in his pool just as Ray arrives to say goodbye. Ray and Samantha have a Mexican stand-off. The now-useless tape is thrown into the pool, and Samantha slowly backs out of the house, leaving Ray to sort out the mess. As Ray sits to contemplate his next move, he doesn't notice Samantha sneaking back inside, who shoots Ray in the back. Samantha leaves and Ray is left in a pool of blood, but still alive. The scene from the film's opening replays as Ray picks up the phone to call Eddie and reaches Dillon, who comes to clean up his mess. \n\nDillon finally gets Ray to a secure location, and Ray pays him off so that he can return to London, where he recuperates for several days in the care of Maggie. Ray thinks quickly about what he should do when he receives a phone call from Eddie, telling him that Jack Rawlings wants to see him on the rooftop of a car-park in Chinatown later that evening. After Eddie hangs up, he anonymously calls Brice and tells him about the meeting. Brice is confused, but eager to settle the score with Ray. He calls Danny to tell him that he should follow Ray to the meeting and kill him.\n\nWhile Danny circles the streets of London in an attempt to find Ray, he stumbles on Maggie and follows her back to her flat. Ray, meanwhile, is visiting with Cindy, whom he had rescued from the streets prior to his departure to Los Angeles and had given shelter to while she attempted to recover from her drug habit. Danny forces his way into Maggie's apartment and, after roughing her up, takes Ray's remaining money and returns to his place. When Ray returns, he grabs Maggie and they head over to Danny's flat. Ray breaks in and finds Nikki (Meredith Ostrom) clutching the bag of money and Danny jamming on drugs. Ray also hears a recording on Danny's answering machine of Brice telling Danny to kill him. Ray kills Danny, then takes the tapes from the answering machine and the bag of money. He and Maggie then leave to head to the rendezvous in Chinatown. \n\nBrice arrives at Danny's place a little later after Nikki has called the police, and finds Danny dead. Brice also notices that the tapes from the machine are missing and now has no choice but to show up on the car park rooftop for the inevitable showdown.\n\n\"Played\" came about through a series of bizarre circumstances. Mick Rossi was working as a writer in Hollywood at the time and was having no luck in selling or producing his scripts. He was desperate to put some of his ideas on film and with the collaboration of his friend and partner Sean Stanek, the two embarked on shooting a short film to break the ice and display some of their talents. Gabriel Byrne was a close friend of Rossi's and agreed to do some filming with the two young filmmakers.\n\nAs Rossi describes in an interview after the film was made: \n\n"}

Sprint offered both residential and business services. It was a key company in the long-distance wars of Canada.\n\nU.S.-based Sprint Corporation entered the Canadian market in the mid-1990s as a reseller of bulk long-distance telephone lines that it bought from domestic companies. Under Canadian foreign ownership regulations, Sprint could not open its own network. In 1993, Sprint entered into a strategic alliance with Call-Net Enterprises, a Canadian long-distance service, and bought 25 percent of the company. Call-Net's long-distance service was renamed “Sprint Canada”, and expanded to include landline and internet services. In a partnership with Fido Solutions, it offered wireless services. In 2005, Call-Net and Sprint Canada's 600,000 customers (including 31,000 wireless subscribers) were acquired by Rogers Communications.\n\nSprint Canada charged a system access fee for all of its services. The home phone, long-distance and Internet services each had a $4.25 fee, while the Sprint and Fido bundles have a $6.95 fee. For clarity purposes, prices stated in this article already include such fees.\n\nBoth traditional and VoIP landline phones were available.\n\nSprint Canada's flagship product was its long-distance. It was available landline and mobile phones.

Both time-limited and unlimited plans were available. \"THE MOST online Basic Unlimited\" had a cost of $23.20 per month and included a single email address. For an additional $3, one could upgrade to \"THE MOST online XTRA\", which included Internet call waiting and four additional email addresses. This allowed the customer to answer calls while surfing online.\n\nSprint Canada had a partnership with Fido Solutions. It consisted of bundling Sprint Canada's landline phone service with Fido's wireless phone service. Sprint's long-distance plans could be used on either or both phones, but Fido month minutes would be deducted for any calls made on the Fido phone.\n\nTwo monthly plans were offered, with different allowances for local wireless minutes:\n\nDaytime minutes could be used from Monday to Friday between 8 am and 7 pm. Evenings and weekend minutes could be used at any time on Saturdays and Sundays. From Monday to Friday, they could only be used between midnight and 8 am, and between 7 pm and midnight. If a customer has any unused minutes at the end of a month, they cannot be carried over to the next month.\n\nAll plans included call waiting, conference call and 1000 call forwarding minutes. In addition, customers could add two extra calling features at no cost: Caller ID, voicemail, or 50 sent SMS to Canada and the USA.

{"id": "2188689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188689", "title": "Weather front", "text": "Weather front\n\nA weather front is a boundary separating bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift.\n\nCold fronts and occluded fronts generally move from west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because of the greater density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts. When a front becomes stationary—and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes—the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. This is most common over the open ocean.\n\nThe Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classifications are indicated by three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant upward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter designates the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. Fronts separate air masses of different types or origins, and are located along troughs of lower pressure.\n\nA surface weather analysis is a special type of weather map which provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations. Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea-level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts. Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an \"H\" may represent high pressure, implying fair weather. An \"L\" on the other hand may represent low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Low pressure also creates surface winds deriving from high pressure zones. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. In addition, areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.\n\nThere are two different meanings used within meteorology to describe weather around a frontal zone. The term \"anafront\" describes boundaries which show instability, meaning air rises rapidly along and over the boundary to cause significant weather changes. A \"katafront\" is weaker, bringing smaller changes in temperature and moisture, as well as limited rainfall.\n\nA cold front is located at the leading edge of the temperature drop off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the leading edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts often bring heavy thunderstorms, rain, and hail. Cold fronts can produce sharper changes in weather and move up to twice as quickly as warm fronts, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly replaces the warm air preceding the boundary. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangle-shaped pips pointing in the direction of travel, and it is placed at the leading edge of the cooler air mass. Cold fronts come in association with a low-pressure area. The concept of colder, dense air \"wedging\" under the less dense warmer air is often used to depict how air is lifted along a frontal boundary. The cold air wedging underneath warmer air creates the strongest winds just above the ground surface, a phenomenon often associated with property-damaging wind gusts. This lift would then form a narrow line of showers and thunderstorms if enough moisture were present. However, this concept isn't an accurate description of the physical processes; upward motion is not produced because of warm air \"ramping up\" cold, dense air, rather, frontogenetical circulation is behind the upward forcing.\n\nWarm fronts are at the leading edge of a homogeneous warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.\n\nThis also forces temperature differences across warm fronts to be broader in scale. Clouds ahead of the warm front are mostly stratiform, and rainfall gradually increases as the front approaches. Fog can also occur preceding a warm frontal passage. Clearing and warming is usually rapid after frontal passage. If the warm air mass is unstable, thunderstorms may be embedded among the stratiform clouds ahead of the front, and after frontal passage thundershowers may continue. On weather maps, the surface location of a warm front is marked with a red line of semicircles pointing in the direction of travel.\n\nAn occluded front is formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front, and usually forms around mature low-pressure areas. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is warmer than the cold air ahead of the warm front and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air.\n\nA wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the \"trowal\", the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.\n\nOccluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. The trowal is indicated by a series of blue and red junction lines.\n\nA stationary front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, neither of which is strong enough to replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.\n\nA wide variety of weather can be found along a stationary front, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but they can transform into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing in opposite directions, indicating no significant movement.\n\nWhen stationary fronts become smaller in scale, degenerating to a narrow zone where wind direction changes significantly over a relatively short distance, they become known as shearlines. A shearline is depicted as a line of red dots and dashes. Stationary fronts may bring snow or rain for a long period of time.\n\nA similar phenomenon to a weather front is the dry line, which is the boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences. When the westerlies increase on the north side of surface highs, areas of lowered pressure will form downwind of north–south oriented mountain chains, leading to the formation of a lee trough. Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier air like a cold front. At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. A weaker form of the dry line seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in moisture. When moisture pools along the boundary during the warm season, it can be the focus of diurnal thunderstorms.\n\nThe dry line may occur anywhere on earth in regions intermediate between desert areas and warm seas. The southern plains west of the Mississippi River in the United States are a particularly favored location. The dry line normally moves eastward during the day and westward at night. A dry line is depicted on National Weather Service (NWS) surface analyses as an orange line with scallops facing into the moist sector. Dry lines are one of the few surface fronts where the pips indicated do not necessarily reflect the direction of motion.\n\nOrganized areas of thunderstorm activity not only reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, but can outrun cold fronts in a pattern where the upper level jet splits apart into two streams, with the resultant Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) forming at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern running southeast into the warm sector parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong and linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise. Even weaker and less organized areas of thunderstorms lead to locally cooler air and higher pressures, and outflow boundaries exist ahead of this type of activity, which can act as foci for additional thunderstorm activity later in the day.\n\nThese features are often depicted in the warm season across the United States on surface analyses and lie within surface troughs. If outflow boundaries or squall lines form over arid regions, a haboob may result. Squall lines are depicted on NWS surface analyses as an alternating pattern of two red dots and a dash labelled SQLN or SQUALL LINE, while outflow boundaries are depicted as troughs with a label of OUTFLOW BOUNDARY.\n\nFronts are the principal cause of significant weather. \"Convective precipitation\" (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by the movement of the cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air. If the temperature differences of the two air masses involved are large and the turbulence is extreme because of wind shear and the presence of a strong jet stream, \"roll clouds\" and tornadoes may occur.\n\nIn the warm season, lee troughs, breezes, outflow boundaries and occlusions can lead to convection if enough moisture is available. \"Orographic precipitation\" is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward to the east of mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively steady, as in rain or drizzle. Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.\n\nFronts are generally guided by winds aloft, but do not move as quickly. Cold fronts and occluded fronts in the Northern Hemisphere usually travel from the northwest to southeast, while warm fronts move more poleward with time. In the Northern Hemisphere a warm front moves from southwest to northeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the reverse is true; a cold front usually moves from southwest to northeast, and a warm front moves from northwest to southeast. Movement is largely caused by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis effect, which is caused by Earth's spinning about its axis. Frontal zones can be slowed down by geographic features like mountains and large bodies of warm water.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188764", "title": "MTT Turbine Superbike", "text": "MTT Turbine Superbike\n\nThe MTT Y2K Turbine Motorcycle, also known as the Y2K Turbine Superbike, is a motorcycle powered by a turboshaft engine, made by Marine Turbine Technologies since 2000. The bikes are not mass-produced in continuous series; each unique bike is hand made to order after receiving the buyer's specifications. Guinness World Records considers it as the most expensive production motorcycle.\n\nWhen MTT president Ted Mclntyre decided to add a motorcycle to his firm's range, he appointed Christian Travert, a former bike racer and custom builder, to head the project. Early models were powered by a Rolls-Royce-Allison Model 250-C18 gas turbine producing a claimed at 52,000 rpm. Unlike some turbojet-powered motorcycles which relied on jet propulsion for thrust, the Y2K Superbike's turboshaft engine drives the rear wheel via a two-speed gearbox and chain and sprocket. The motorcycles are produced on demand and made to order for buyers.\n\nThe turbines used in the motorcycles are second-hand, having reached the original manufacturer's mandated running time limit, after which they must be rebuilt regardless of condition. MTT refurbishes the engines and extends a long term warranty with the purchase of every bike.\n\nA turbine engine can be easily run on a wide variety of fuels, and so like other turbine engines, the MTT Turbine Superbike does not require jet fuel to operate, since it doesn't have to handle the extremes of temperatures that jet fuel is modified to operate in without coagulating or waxing. MTT has fuelled the Y2K with diesel, kerosene and Bio-Fuel (all similar to jet fuel in composition). Thicker fuel is preferable because it has a higher energy content per unit of fuel, but a turbine can be run off of gasoline or other flammable liquids just as easily, or even powderized fuel such as coal dust if a delivery system is set up for it.\n\nIn 2006, MTT released the \"Street Fighter,\" at the Las Vegas SEMA show. The Street Fighter began the standardization of the more powerful turbine from the Allison 250-C20B engine.\n\nIn 2015, MTT released two new models. The first was a trike with the 420 HP turbine engine. It features the latest technology and enhanced safety features. The second new bike released by MTT is the 420-RR (\"Race Ready\"). The 420-RR is the most extreme bike that MTT produces based on technical advances, aerodynamics and Race Ready enhancements.\n\nThe Discovery Channel TV show \"Greatest Ever: Motorcycles\" ranked the Turbine Superbike the fourth greatest motorcycle, saying that it held a Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production motorcycle, and that it was also the most expensive.\n\nJay Leno, owner of the first \"production\" Y2K Turbine Motorcycle with serial number 002, said, \"It really does scare you half to death, but it's great fun.\" Leno also said, \"I've got to go with the Y2K Jet Bike as one of the all time sexiest. It's the most fun because it's a bike... and it's a jet, and because it's the best motorcycle ever for shutting up the Harley guys.\" Leno said at a traffic light, the heat from the bike's exhaust melted the bumper of the car behind.\n\nLeno said that after he took delivery of his bike, development was ongoing and design changes were being made. At the time, he had ridden his MTT bike about 2000 miles, more than anyone else. Some parts failed during this time, and Leno was supplied with new and redesigned alternatives to try out. McIntyre told Leno that the bikes would be sold only to select buyers, those he thought would take proper care of the turbine engine, which is warrantied for life, and not get themselves killed.\n\nPaul Garson praised its audacity. \"Men's Journal\" said it is, \"One the most awe-inspiring, innovative, and otherwise amazing designs. With production limited to five per year it's no wonder the MTT Turbine Superbike has become a revolution\", in their feature article 'Perfect Stuff'.\n\nJohn Burns, of \"Motorcyclist\", said, \"Under full power, tracks like a bullet train…and the strangest thing is the complete lack of vibration. You hear the turbine but don't feel the turbine, except for the fact that it's trying to smoothly compress all your vertebrae into one dense donut.\"\n\n\"It's bloody mad and extremely scary... it feels like bungee-jumping, except with the bungee pulling you forwards and not upwards. The sheer sense of uncontrollable acceleration building and the wind noise rushing up to meet you\", said John Cantlie of \"Motor Cycle News\".\n\n\n"}

It is about one mile east of Spiro, Oklahoma and west of Fort Smith, Arkansas. It was capital of the Choctaw Nation, capital of the Moshulatubbee District, Choctaw Nation, and in the late 1850s a stop for the Butterfield Stage. It developed as a political and business center of the nation before the Civil War. Skullyville was the site of the Choctaw Agency from 1832 until 1839.\n\nDuring the Civil War, after the Choctaw allied with the Confederacy, the town suffered serious damage in warfare. Afterward the town was bypassed by construction of a new railroad in the area, and it was abandoned by businessmen who moved to the nearest railroad station. In 1917 closure of the post office marked the final decline of the community. It is now considered a ghost town and little more than the cemetery remains .\n\nThe name is derived from \"iskulli\" or \"iskuli\", the Choctaw word for money, because originally this was the place where members collected their annuity payments at the Choctaw Agency.\n\nThe Choctaw Indian agency was built on this site in 1832, after the federal government conducted removal of the tribe to Indian Territory. The US Indian agent distributed annuity payments here, and a trading and business community developed around the post. Until 1859, after unification of the three districts of the Nation, the community was officially called Choctaw Agency. Major F. W. Armstrong served as the first US agent until his death in 1835. He was succeeded by his brother, William Armstrong. Reportedly, both were very well liked by the Choctaws.\n\nThe Choctaw designated Skullyville, then known as Oak Lodge, as county seat of Skullyville County, the capital of the Moshulatubbee District of the Nation, and as the capital of the Choctaw Nation. It also served as a stop on the California Road. Walker's Station, a stage stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail route, was also located in Skullyville. Unusually for the Choctaw Nation's county governments, an extant building from its time as county seat exists: the Skullyville County Jail.\n\nThe name \"Skullyville\" is derived from \"iskulli\" or \"iskuli\", the Choctaw word for money, as this was the place for collection of annuity payments at the Choctaw Agency. Author W. B. Morrison suggests that the English meaning of Skullyville was \"Moneytown.\"\n\nIn 1834 the US Army built Fort Coffee was built at Swallow Rock, about from the Choctaw Agency. The army maintained it for four years; it then reassigned the garrison as no longer needed. Methodist missionaries took over the facility and adapted it as a boys' school, known as Fort Coffee Academy. During the Civil War, the buildings were burned down in the conflict. The school was never reopened.\n\nThe Methodist Church established New Hope Seminary, a girls' school, in Skullyville during the mid 1840s. It attracted students from all over the Choctaw Nation. It closed during the war, but reopened afterward. It continued to operate until the building burned down in 1896.\n\nSkullyville had become a political, educational and social center for the Choctaw during the 1840s. But after the nation moved the national capital to Doaksville in 1850, tensions among factions erupted into more tribal political strife. In 1858 a majority of members adopted the Skullyville Constitution at a convention in Skullyville. It abolished the three districts to unify the nation under one principal leader, known as the governor.\n\nTandy Walker, from a prominent Choctaw family, took over the former Choctaw Agency building when he was appointed in 1858 as supervisor of the Butterfield Stage stop. He was also governor of the unified Choctaw Nation. He adapted this building for use both as his residence and with space for the Butterfield Stage office. Walker retained it as his home until he died in 1877. According to Morrison, the old agency building still stood in the 1930s. The structure is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR 72001074).\n\nSkullyville began to decline after the Civil War. The Choctaw aligned with the Confederacy and served in their army. The boys' academy and other buildings were burned during warfare. After the Kansas City Southern Railway bypassed it in 1895, the town's businessmen moved to Spiro, the closest railroad station, which they judged essential for their trading and getting products to mark. When the post office closed in 1917, this essentially marked the death of the community. Skullyville is now a ghost town, with only a cemetery remaining.\n\nThe community is within the Fort Smith, Arkansas-Oklahoma Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188790", "title": "Anthony Read", "text": "Anthony Read\n\nAnthony \"Tony\" Read (21 April 1935 – 21 November 2015) was a British script editor, television writer and author. He was principally active in British television from the 1960s to the mid-1980s, although he occasionally contributed to televised productions until 1999. Beginning in the 1980s, he launched a second career as a print author, concentrating largely on World War II histories. Since 2004 he regularly wrote prose fiction, mainly in the form of a revival of his television series \"The Baker Street Boys\" (1983).\n\nRead was born in the small mining community of Cheslyn Hay, Staffordshire. He originally set out to become an actor, due to his education at Queen Mary’s grammar school in Walsall, known for its strong theatrical tradition, and then at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. General mobilization interrupted his studies and he founded a theatre company called Theatre Unlimited. However, with his acting career lasting only for a short time, he first became an advertising copywriter, then joined the National Service as a gunner with the Royal Artillery, and later worked as editor at Jonathan Cape. He finally joined the BBC in 1963.\n\nHis earliest work was as a freelance writer for \"Z-Cars\" in 1962. He started working at the BBC on 2 November 1963. He soon graduated to writer/script editor of several other adventure-mystery series, like the anthological \"Detective\", \"The Indian Tales of Rudyard Kipling\" and the version of \"Sherlock Holmes\" (1965) with Douglas Wilmer in the lead. The balance of the decade was spent on the drama, \"The Troubleshooters\". A series about the petroleum industry, \"Troubleshooters\" provided Read with the steadiest work of his career. He was the series' original script editor in 1965, and ended his run as producer of the 1969 season.\n\nWhen he departed \"The Troubleshooters\", Read kept his producer's hat on for a few years, before returning to his more traditional roles of script editing and writing. \"The Lotus Eaters\" and \"The Dragon's Opponent\" extended his run as a producer of contemporary dramas. It also continued a few key professional relationships he had enjoyed since the mid-1960s. On \"The Lotus Eaters\", Read was reunited with director Douglas Camfield and writer David Fisher.\n\nBy 1978, Read had been brought into \"Doctor Who\" as script editor by the new producer Graham Williams. Read replaced Robert Holmes in mid-season; Holmes had stayed on after the end of the 14th season at Williams' request. In the 16th season Read oversaw the \"Key to Time\" story arc (taking over part of the producer's duties when Williams fell ill), and shaped the character of the first Romana played by Mary Tamm. A key ally in his days on \"Doctor Who\" was again David Fisher. Fisher wrote two of the \"Key to Time\" stories, and then wrote (or co-wrote) three more stories in the next year.\n\nRead was also instrumental in commissioning Douglas Adams as a \"Doctor Who\" writer, and for advocating the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" author should be appointed as his replacement as script editor. His final contribution to \"Doctor Who\" was as scriptwriter for \"The Horns of Nimon\". Given the cancellation of \"Shada\", he was thus the final writer of the Graham Williams era on the programme.\n\nImmediately following his stint on \"Doctor Who\" in 1979, he contributed the scripts for the episodes \"Powers of Darkness\" and \"Out of Body, Out of Mind\" to the paranormal thriller series \"The Omega Factor.\"\n\nHe also contributed to \"The Horns of Nimon\" that same year, a story based on the myth of the Minotaur.\n\nTogether with Don Houghton, he co-wrote the fifth \"Sapphire & Steel\" television story, known informally as \"Dr McDee Must Die\". In 1984 Read adapted the John Wyndham novel, \"Chocky\", for Children's ITV. Its success led to two original sequels: \"Chocky's Children\" and \"Chocky's Challenge\". In an interview for the DVD release of \"Chocky\", Read revealed that the Wyndham estate considered his adaptation of \"Chocky\" to be the best adaptation ever produced from Wyndham's novels.\n\nRead's biggest critical success of the 1980s, however, was \"The Baker Street Boys\" (1983). The series' unique approach to the world of Sherlock Holmes gained Read an award from the Writers' Guild of Great Britain.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Read gradually began to replace his television work with a burgeoning career in print.\n\nIn his second career as an author he continued his relationship with David Fisher into the world of non-fiction writing. While the majority of Read's books were solo works, he and Fisher collaborated a number of times, almost always to explore some aspect of World War II. Together they wrote \"The Fall of Berlin\" (1992), \"The Deadly Embrace: Hitler, Stalin and the Nazi-Soviet Pact, 1939–1941\" (1988), \"The Proudest Day: India's Long Road to Independence\", (1997) \"Operation Lucy: The Most Secret Spy Ring of the Second World War\" (1980), \"Berlin Rising: Biography of a City\" (1994), \"Colonel Z: The Secret Life of a Master of Spies\" (1984), and \"Kristallnacht: The Nazi Night of Terror\". He also wrote \"Conspirator: Churchill, Roosevelt, and Tyler Kent, Spy\" with Ray Bearse. On his own he wrote \"The Devil's Disciples: Hitler's Inner Circle\" (2003) and \"The World On Fire: 1919 and the Battle with Bolshevism (2008) \". Read's solo non-fiction works followed a similar interest in World War II, but he occasionally wrote prose fiction. He was the main writer of a series of novels about \"The Baker Street Boys\", a television show for which he wrote in the early 1980s.\n\nRead was an active member of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, serving as chair between 1981 and 1982. He drew up an industry-wide code of practice on behalf of the young writers he was committed to nurturing, never taking pay or expenses for his work on the guild’s behalf. He was also a director of the associated Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society. He co-wrote a submission from the Writers’ Guild and the Directors and Producers Association to the Annan committee on the future of broadcasting that was subsequently used as part of the charter agreement for establishing Channel 4.\n"}
{"id": "2188793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188793", "title": "Martina Arroyo", "text": "Martina Arroyo\n\nMartina Arroyo (born February 2, 1936) is an American operatic soprano who had a major international opera career from the 1960s through the 1980s. She was part of the first generation of black opera singers of Puerto Rican descent to achieve wide success, and is viewed as part of an instrumental group of performers who helped break down the barriers of racial prejudice in the opera world.\n\nArroyo first rose to prominence at the Zurich Opera between 1963–1965, and then was one of the Metropolitan Opera's leading sopranos between 1965 and 1978. During her 13 years at the Metropolitan Opera, she was also a regular presence at the world's opera houses, performing on the stages of La Scala, Covent Garden, the Opéra National de Paris, the Teatro Colón, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Vienna State Opera, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the San Francisco Opera. She is best known for her performances of the Italian spinto repertoire, and in particular, her portrayals of Verdi and Puccini heroines. Her last opera performance was in 1991, after which she has devoted her time to teaching singing on the faculties of various universities in the United States and Europe. On December 8, 2013, Arroyo received a Kennedy Center Honor.\n\nArroyo was born in New York City, the younger of two children of Demetrio Arroyo, originally from Puerto Rico, and Lucille Washington, a native of Charleston, South Carolina. Her older brother grew up to become a Baptist minister. The family lived in Harlem near St. Nicholas Avenue and 111th Street. Her father was a mechanical engineer at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and earned a good salary which enabled Arroyo's mother to stay at home with their children. His job also allowed the family to experience New York's cultural offerings and the family frequented museums, concerts, and the theatre. It was attending several performances of Broadway shows during the 1940s that first inspired Arroyo's interest in becoming a performer. Her mother humored her dreams and allowed Arroyo to take ballet classes. Her mother was also a talented amateur classical pianist and taught her daughter to play the instrument. Arroyo's other musical experiences as a child were largely through singing in the choirs at her Baptist church and as a student at Hunter College High School.\n\nAfter finishing high school in 1953, Arroyo attended Hunter College where she earned a B.A. in Romance languages in 1956 at the age of nineteen. While there she studied voice as a hobby in an opera workshop with Joseph Turnau. Turnau recognized that Arroyo was a major talent who just needed proper training. After the workshop ended, he introduced her to voice instructor Marinka Gurewich, who immediately accepted her as a student. When Arroyo did not take her training as seriously as her teacher wanted, Gurewich eventually threatened to end their lessons. Arroyo said of the incident,\n\nShe further explained that at that point most of the major opera houses, including the Metropolitan Opera, had never cast a black singer, so in her mind \"opera wasn't a real possibility.\" Gurewich's threat, however, forced her to take her studies more seriously and she continued to study with her until Gurewich's death in 1990. Another important partnership formed around this time was with concert manager Thea Dispeker who, after attending one of Arroyo's recitals, offered her services at no charge until Arroyo's career took off. Dispeker helped manage much of Arroyo's career over the next several decades.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Arroyo was faced with the difficulty of working while trying to study singing. On the advice of her mother, she became an English teacher at Bronx High School in the Fall of 1956 but found it difficult to balance her teaching responsibilities with continued training under Gurewich. She decided to leave her teaching position and take work as a social worker at the East End Welfare Center. For two years, she managed a case load of over 100 welfare recipients while continuing her voice training. Arroyo found the work fulfilling and stated of the experience, \"My life had been centered on music for so long, and suddenly there I was, deeply involved in other people's problems,\".\n\nIn 1957 Arroyo auditioned for the Metropolitan Opera but was not accepted. Somewhat disheartened, she flirted with the idea of becoming an academic and began working on a master's degree in comparative literature at New York University with a dissertation on Ignacio Silone's \"Pane e Vino and Vino e Pane\". The following year she competed in and won the Metropolitan Opera's \"Audition of the Air\" competition (precursor to its National Council Auditions), earning a $1,000 cash prize and a scholarship to the Met's Kathryn Long School. She left NYU and entered the Kathryn Long School in the Fall of 1957 where she studied singing, drama, German, English diction, and fencing. While at the school, she was offered the role of the first coryphée in the American premiere of Ildebrando Pizzetti's \"Murder in the Cathedral\" to be performed at a festival in upstate New York. The concert, however, was rained out and was rescheduled for a performance at Carnegie Hall instead on September 17, 1958. This marked Arroyo's first professional appearance singing in an opera. \"The New York Times\" said of her performance, \"Martina Arroyo is a gifted soprano who appears to have remarkable potential, and she sang with a voice of amplitude and lovely color.\"\n\nIn February 1959 Arroyo sang the title role in Gluck's \"Iphigénie en Tauride\" in a concert version with the Little Orchestra Society at Town Hall. Shortly thereafter she made her debut on the opera stage at the Metropolitan Opera as the Celestial Voice in Giuseppe Verdi's \"Don Carlo\" on March 14, 1959 with Eugenio Fernandi in the title role, Leonie Rysanek as Elizabeth, Robert Merrill as Rodrigo, and Nell Rankin as Princess Eboli. This was the beginning of a long association with the Met and the beginning of a lengthy career on the opera stage.\n\nAfter having made her Met debut, Arroyo moved to Europe where she began to appear in roles with minor opera houses in 1959. While performing in Italy of that year she met her future husband, professional violist Emilio Poggioni. The marriage ended in divorce and she later was married to Michel Maurel until his death in 2011. Over the next several years Arroyo worked mostly in Europe in mostly smaller roles, failing to land the larger name-making roles. Those larger parts which she did get were mostly in more obscure works. During 1961 and 1962 she went back and forth between Europe and the Metropolitan Opera frequently, with her roles at the Met during this period being in Richard Wagner's \"The Ring Cycle\" and in reprises of \"Don Carlo\". Her roles in the \"Ring\" included the Third Norn and Woglinde in \"Götterdämmerung\", Woglinde in \"Das Rheingold\", Ortlinde in \"Die Walküre\", and the Forest Bird in \"Siegfried\".\n\nIn 1963 Arroyo's first major break came when she was offered a contract to join the Zurich Opera as a principal soprano. She made her debut there in the title role of Verdi's \"Aida\" where she was received enthusiastically. She continued to sing regularly at that opera house through 1968.\n\nAida became an important role for Arroyo early in her career, serving as a calling card for her at many major opera houses during the 1960s. She sang the role for her first appearance at the Hamburg State Opera in 1963 and at both the Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Vienna State Opera in 1964. In February of the following year she sang Aida in her first starring role at the Met as a last minute replacement for Birgit Nilsson. The performance received rave reviews with \"The New York Times\" praising Arroyo as \"one of the most gorgeous voices before the public today.\" Rudolf Bing, the Met's director, immediately offered her a contract to join the roster of the company's principal sopranos which extended for several years.\n\nArroyo began the 1965/66 season at the Met in October with a critically acclaimed performance of Elizabeth in \"Don Carlo\". She immediately became a favorite singer at that house portraying mostly Verdi heroines and the Met became her principal home from that point up until 1978. Her other roles at the Met during these thirteen years included Aida, Amelia in Verdi's \"Un ballo in maschera\", Cio-Cio-San in Giacomo Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\", Donna Anna in Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\", Elvira in Verdi's \"Ernani\", Lady Macbeth in Verdi's \"Macbeth\", Leonora in Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", Leonora in Verdi's \"La forza del destino\", Liù in Puccini's \"Turandot\", Maddalena in Umberto Giordano's \"Andrea Chénier\", Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", and the title role in Amilcare Ponchielli's \"La Gioconda\" among others. She was also notably the first black person to portray the role of Elsa in Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" in 1968, not just at the Met, but in all of opera history.\n\nDuring her years at the Met, Arroyo would frequently travel to perform at other houses both in the United States and internationally. In 1968 she sang for the first time in Israel and made her first appearance in the United Kingdom as Valentine in a London concert performance of Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\". Later that year she made her debut at the Royal Opera at Covent Garden and the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company, both singing the role of Aida. She returned to both companies a number of times during the 1970s as Verdi heroines and in parts like the title roles in Puccini's \"Tosca\" and Richard Strauss's \"Ariadne auf Naxos\". She sang Amelia in \"Un ballo in maschera\" for her debuts with both the San Francisco Opera (1971) and the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1972). She returned to Chicago to sing her first Amelia Grimaldi in Verdi's \"Simon Boccanegra\" in 1974. In 1972 she sang Aida for her debut at La Scala opposite Plácido Domingo as Radames. In 1973 she made her first appearances at the Opéra National de Paris and the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. In 1977 she made her debut with the Opera Company of Philadelphia portraying Senta in Wagner's \"The Flying Dutchman\" and in 1979 made her debut with Michigan Opera Theatre as Lenora in \"Il trovatore\". She remained very busy in the world's major opera houses through 1979 singing mostly Verdi, Puccini, and Strauss heroines and other roles from the lirico-spinto repertoire. Arroyo portrayed herself in an episode of \"The Odd Couple\" titled \"Your Mother Wears Army Boots\", which originally aired on January 16, 1975. The episode also featured Howard Cosell who is portrayed to be a big fan of hers.\n\nBy 1980, Arroyo's career had started to slow down and she was much more selective in what roles she chose to take. She returned to the Met in 1986 to sing Aida and Santuzza; making her last appearance and 199th performance at that house on October 31, 1986. In 1987 she sang her last portrayal of the title role in \"Turandot\" with the Seattle Opera and in 1989 she announced her retirement from the opera stage. She came out of retirement in 1991 for one last performance in the world premiere of Leslie Adams's \"Blake\", an opera whose story is set in pre-Civil War America when slavery was still a reality.\n\nThroughout her career Arroyo was also a frequent performer of the concert repertoire and appeared with many of the world's leading symphony orchestras. She performed often with the New York Philharmonic under conductor Leonard Bernstein who particularly admired her voice in such repertoire as Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\" and \"Missa Solemnis\".\n\nArroyo's talents also extended beyond the concert stage into the realm of live network television. In 1964 she appeared with the CBS Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Alfredo Antonini in the episode \"Feliz Borinquen\" of the \"CBS Repertoire Workshop\" as herself.\n\nMartina Arroyo is a recipient of a 2010 Opera Honors Award from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nHaving performed in the major opera houses and with the greatest symphony orchestras of the world, she has left a legacy of recordings, including: Handel's \"Judas Maccabeus\" (twice) and \"Samson\", Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" (Donna Elvira for Karl Böhm and Donna Anna for Sir Colin Davis), Beethoven's \"Missa solemnis\" and \"Ninth Symphony\", Rossini's \"Stabat mater\", Verdi's \"I vespri siciliani\", \"Un ballo in maschera\", \"La forza del destino\" (in both the St. Petersburg and revised versions), and the \"Messa da requiem\" and Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony the Symphony of a Thousand.\n\nShe has recorded important 20th-century music, including Schoenberg's \"Gurre-Lieder\" and the \"African Oratorio\" by . She sang in the world premieres of two works: Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Momente\" and Samuel Barber's \"Andromache's Farewell\".\n\nArroyo's discography (which also includes an aria recital), though enviable, does not encompass anything like the full range of roles she played on stage. At the Metropolitan Opera alone, these are the operas she performed but never recorded commercially: Verdi's \"Ernani\", \"Macbeth\", \"Il trovatore\", \"Don Carlos\" (the Celestial Voice as well as Elizabeth, both in Italian), and \"; Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" and \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (featured roles in all four operas); Ponchielli's \"La Gioconda\"; Giordano's \"Andrea Chénier\"; and Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" and \"Turandot\" (as Liù; she played the title role in Toronto).\n\nSince her official retirement from singing in 1989 Arroyo has amassed significant teaching credits, including stints at Louisiana State University, UCLA, University of Delaware, Wilberforce University, the International Sommerakademie-Mozarteum in Salzburg and Indiana University.\n\nShe has given master classes nationally and internationally, and judged several competitions including the George London Competition and the Tchaikovsky International Competition./With Willard L. Boyd, former President of the University of Iowa, she co-authored the \"Task Force Report on Music Education in the U.S.\"\n\nIn 1976, she was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the National Council of the Arts in Washington, D.C. She founded the Martina Arroyo Foundation, which is dedicated to the development of emerging young opera singers by immersing them in complete role preparation courses. She is also active on the Boards of Trustees of Hunter College and Carnegie Hall. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000. She was candid about her perceived status as second-best to her great contemporary, fellow African-American spinto Leontyne Price; once, when a Met doorman greeted her as \"Miss Price,\" she sweetly replied, \"No, honey, I'm the other one.\"\n\nNotes \nSources\n\n"}

With around 12,000 students, the university offers 32 undergraduate programmes and 33 master programmes; all are available in Romanian, 6 in English and 1 in French. Furthermore, there are also two doctoral schools specialised in five fields: Agronomy, Animal Science, Biotechnologies, Horticulture, and Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe university has two campuses located in Bucharest, Romania. The Herăstrău campus, which is the main campus, was established in 1868, and is spread over an area of 38 hectares. It is located north of the city centre, adjacent to Herăstrău Park (now known as King Michael I Park), Bucharest's largest park. The main campus hosts six of the seven faculties and several of the university's facilities (such as research buildings, student residences, a botanical garden and experimental fields).\n\nSince 1887, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine is located at the Cotroceni campus in the centre of Bucharest, along the Dâmbovița River. This campus has an area of 5.5 hectares, and besides the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and its related facilities, it also hosts student residences and a veterinary clinic (which is open to the general public).\n\nIts origin lies in a document signed in 1852 by Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei, Ruler of Wallachia (1849–1856), who founded the Institute of Agriculture in Pantelimon, near Bucharest. The Institute started its activity in 1853, being joined a few years later in 1861 by the School of Veterinary Medicine. The agronomic and veterinary education evolved towards more developed forms, interrelated to the increasing need of specialists in plant and animal breeding, with the development of specialised sciences and knowledge.\n\nIn 1867, when the curricula expanded to include forestry sciences, the university became the Central School of Agriculture and Forestry. The first experimental didactic farm in Romania was established within this institution. On the 1st of August 1868, King Carol I laid the foundation stone of the new campus on the Herăstrău Estate in Bucharest, and in 1869, teachers and students started their activity there. In 1887, the first agricultural research institution in Romania, named the Bucharest Agronomic Station, was established within the university and experimental land plots were established on the Herăstrău lake shore. \n\nThe first part of the 20th century saw many changes to the structure of the university. In 1915, it was renamed as the Higher School of Agriculture, and in 1921, the School of Veterinary Medicine became a faculty of the University of Bucharest. During the following years, the agronomic education developed further under several names: Higher School of Agriculture from Herăstrău (1915), Academy of Higher Agronomic Studies (1929), Faculty of Agronomy – merged within the Bucharest Polytechnic School (1938), and the Agronomic Institute of Bucharest (1948). In 1948, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine returned to the Agronomic Institute of Bucharest, once again becoming part of the university. \n\nIn 1992, the name changed to the University of Agronomic Sciences, and in 1996 it became the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest.\n\nThe University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest has adopted the Bologna Process and European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). The University currently offers programs in Romanian, English and French in all the three cycle: cycle 1 (bachelor's degree), cycle 2 (master's degree) and cycle 3 (doctorate).\n\nThe university has seven faculties:\n\n\nThe University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest has 52 ERASMUS agreements and 29 international framework agreements.

Amongst the cases his office handled he obtained the conviction of Gerald Amirault and other employees of the Fells Acres Day Care Center in Malden, Massachusetts. Though subsequently reversed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Council (citing the need for \"finality\") the convictions of Violet and Cheryl Amirault were overturned in 1995, in Massachusetts Superior Court. Following the Judicial Council's reinstatement of the verdict, another Superior Court Judge, Isaac Borenstein, granted two separate motions for new trials to the accused. Borenstein held that the interrogations of children by Harshbarger's office and its designated experts, were so tainted by \"grave errors\" in the investigation process that they could not be used in any new trial. However, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court once again ruled to send the women back to prison. The case has been criticized as a miscarriage of justice in publications such as \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The Nation\".\n\nHarshbarger was elected President of the Massachusetts Association of District Attorneys and was awarded the Livingston Hall Award by the American Bar Association for Harshbarger's outstanding work in Juvenile Justice.\n\nIn 1990, he was elected Attorney General of Massachusetts, defeating incumbent James Shannon in the Democratic primary.

By Ursula he had about fourteen children, seven sons and seven daughters, of whom twelve names are known:\n\nHe was styled by the courtesy title \"Earl of Stafford\" (his father's secondary peerage) until the attainder of his father in 1521. In 1547 he petitioned Parliament for restoration in blood, but did not claim any of his father's forfeited land or titles. In 1548 he was summoned to Parliament by writ, by King Edward VI, and was thus created 1st Baron Stafford.\n\nThis was the 4th creation of the title Baron Stafford which eventually was surrendered in 1639 by his descendant Roger Stafford, 6th Baron Stafford (called in his youth by the surname \"Floyde\"), due to his poverty and \"very mean and obscure condition\", at the request of King Charles I. Cleveland commented on him as follows: \"\"This unfortunate man, the great-grandson of the last Duke, was then sixty-five, and had sunk into so abject a condition that he felt ashamed of bearing his own name, and long passed as Fludd, or Floyde, having, it is supposed, assumed the patronymic of one of his uncle's servants, who had reared and sheltered him in early life.\"\"\n\nThe barony was initially regarded as a new creation, but in February 1558, he won the right to have it recognised as carrying precedence of the first creation of 1299, created for his ancestor Edmund de Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford (1272/3-1308), of Stafford Castle in Staffordshire, feudal baron of Stafford. In 1554, having petitioned Queen Mary I for financial assistance, he was made one of two Chamberlains of the Exchequer, a position that brought him an annual fee of £50.\n\nHaving trained as a lawyer at Gray's Inn in 1528, in 1531 he was appointed to the honourable post of recorder of the borough of Stafford, next to his family's ancient seat of Stafford Castle. He was later appointed a justice of the Peace for both Staffordshire and Shropshire in 1536. Between 1558 and 1559 he was the lord-lieutenant of Staffordshire, a role which included being appointed as clerk of the Peace.\n\nStafford had an extensive library of about 300 books, mostly in Latin. In 1548 he published an English translation of the 1534 tract by Edward Foxe, as \"The True Dyfferens Between the Royall Power and the Ecclesiasticall Power\", (original Latin title \"De vera differentia regiae potestatis et ecclesiae\"). Under Queen Mary I he converted back to Catholicism and translated two tracts by Erasmus against Luther, of which neither survives. He commissioned other translations, such as Humphrey Lloyd's version of Vassaeus on urine, and influenced the publication of \"Mirror for Magistrates\" in 1559.\n\nHe died on 30 April 1563, at the age of about 62, at Caus Castle in Shropshire, the seat of the Corbet family. He was buried on 6 May in nearby Worthen Church. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest surviving son Henry Stafford, 2nd Baron Stafford (died 1565), who himself died two years later.\n"}

He currently plays for Molinos El Pirata and the Panamanian national team.\n\nTejada's debut in professional soccer was with Tauro in the local league, where he managed to make a good impression and quickly moved to Colombia to play with Colombian side Deportes Tolima. Later on he was transferred to first division team Envigado in 2004, and after a splendid participation in the Gold Cup, he set off to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2005, he signed a 3-year contract to send him to Al Ain of the United Arab Emirates. However, he did not yield the same results he obtained in the Gold Cup, reason why shortly after finished the AFC Champions League, and he returned to Panama.\n\nReturning to Panama, he participated in the championship of Clausura of ANAPROF with the Plaza Amador, one of the best teams of the local football league, but he only participated in a few matches. His conditioning was not optimal, and he acquired the nickname of \"el gordito (fatty)\". Growing into better form, he moved on to Colombia, where he played a short spell with ex Copa Libertadores champions Once Caldas, from which he was fired for disciplinary problems. He then returned to Panama to play for Plaza Amador.\n\nReal Salt Lake of Major League Soccer announced the signing of Tejada on 12 December 2006, for the 2007 season. He played only two minutes in five games, however, before he was released by head coach Jason Kreis. He returned to Panamanian side Tauro, but did not play very much since he was shortly signed by Colombian side América de Cali. He scored 4 goals during his short stay in Panama.\n\n\"Matador\" scored only 3 goals in the \"Torneo Finalizacion 2007\"; however, he became a key player for América in the next tournament. Tejada played 19 games in the \"Torneo Iniciacion 2008\" where he scored 12 goals, becoming América de Cali's top-scorer and the second in the tournament. Tejada reached the final where America lost to Boyacá Chicó. He was nicknamed by the Colombian press as America's golden tooth (\"el diente de oro del America\") because of his golden tooth. After the tournament, there was much interest for Tejada, including from Argentine side River Plate; however, nothing was concrete. Unfortunately for the \"Matador\" América could not pay his salary and price so he was sold to Bogotá's side Millonarios where he debuted on 16 August 2008 in the \"Embajadores\" victory over Deportes Quindío. After an unsuccessful spell at Millonarios. Tejada returned once more to Tauro and afterwards moved to Peru to play for champions Juan Aurich. At Juan Aurich, Tejada scored an impressive 48 goals in 65 games and attracted interest from teams in stronger leagues such as Mexico and Brazil. Tejada finally moved to Mexican side Deportivo Toluca in late 2012 as a replacement for the Uruguyan striker Iván Alonso. His spell at Toluca began promising after a late arrival, scoring 4 goals in 5 matches; however, his performance and consistency dropped for the liguilla, the Clausura 2013 and in the disappointing performance of Toluca at Copa Libertadores. In summer 2013 he joined Veracruz.\n\nIn December 2013, Tejada returned to Peru where he played with Juan Aurich for two years. He joined Universidad César Vallejo.\n\nOn 1 March 2015, Tejada walked off the pitch during a match against Cienciano after being subjected to racist abuse from fans.\n\nTejada made his debut for Panama in a June 2001 friendly match against Trinidad and Tobago and has, as of 1 August 2015, earned a total of 88 caps, scoring 40 goals and making him Panama's all-time record goalscorer just ahead of Blas Pérez. He represented his country in 24 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and in March 2005, Tejada scored a goal from an overhead kick against Mexico in a World Cup 2006 qualifying match that gave Panama a 1:1 tie against the CONCACAF giants. This goal was voted the best goal of the year by Fox Sports.\n\nTejada led Panama to the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup final, where they finished as runners-up to the United States. He scored three goals to end up as joint top scorer, but unfortunately, he missed his penalty kick in the penalty shoot-out against the United States in the final. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament for his efforts. Tejada is currently the all-time leading scorer in Panama history.\n\nTejada was ejected from the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup semi final against Mexico after receiving a red card.\n\nIn May 2018, he was named in Panama's 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.\n\n\n"}

It features role-playing, strategy, and arcade elements set in feudal Japan. The player begins the game as a little-known vassal samurai; his ultimate goal is to replace Oda Nobunaga as the daimyō responsible for reunifying sengoku Japan.\n\nTommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015. The game was re-released in 2014 on Gog.com and Steam with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nThe game begins by giving the player their choice of name, clan, and family specialty. Within the game, death is final and frequently risked; an early priority is establishing a family, which permits the player to continue as the samurai's heir in the event of death or retirement. In the first two sections of the game, the player rises from a minor retainer to a more powerful lieutenant and then to daimyō over his entire clan. At each of these levels, he competes to curry favor from his lord with three computer-controlled rivals who also seek to become first in favor and next in succession. Each samurai has several properties, including land holdings, army size, sword-fighting ability, and generalship. In keeping with the Bushidō theme of the game, army size and honor have the greatest influence over how the samurai are ranked.\n\nA wide array of dishonorable actions are also possible. The player (and AI controlled characters) may kidnap and rescue family members, dishonor other samurai, or even assassinate their rivals or lord. Naturally, such behavior carries serious risk. The samurai performs these acts personally and risks capture or death. At minimum, exposure entails loss of honor and land and more serious offenses require ritual suicide (seppuku); a failed attempt on the life of the samurai's lord occasions the extermination of his entire family, losing the game.\n\nAfter becoming a daimyō, the game shifts to a wargame format, with the goal of conquering enough provinces to claim the title of shōgun. The player no longer wanders personally through a provincial map but directs his army through the three lower Japanese islands. He is able to direct his underlings to deal with any sword fight or melee minigames without loss of honor: the focus is on the size of the player's army and mastery of the battlefield tactics.\n\nAfter winning the game, the player is given a final summary of the future of his dynasty. Depending on various factors such as the victor's honor and the presence of an adult heir, the length of the dynasty could range from hundreds of years (like the Tokugawa shogunate) to a quick dissolution after the shōgun's death (as occurred with Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi).\n\nMicroProse designers Sid Arnold and Lawrence Schick began development of \"Sword of the Samurai\" in late 1987, after the success of the company's first role-playing adventure game \"Sid Meier's Pirates!\". They chose to set it during the Sengoku period because the era's chaos made it possible for samurai to gain great power regardless of background, and gave players the goal of uniting the country and becoming shōgun. MicroProse co-owner Sid Meier helped develop the NPCs' artificial intelligence and the dueling.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" stated in 1990 that \"Sword of the Samurai\" \"offers even more than its spiritual ancestor, \"Pirates!\"\". It praised the game's graphics, soundtrack, and many choices during gameplay. Later that year and in 1993 the magazine gave it four stars out of five, stating that the game did not sell as well as \"Pirates!\" despite \"near perfect\" game play and historical accuracy.\n"}

{"id": "2188925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188925", "title": "Obsidian hydration dating", "text": "Obsidian hydration dating\n\nObsidian hydration dating (OHD) is a geochemical method of determining age in either absolute or relative terms of an artifact made of obsidian.\n\nObsidian is a volcanic glass that was used by prehistoric people as a raw material in the manufacture of stone tools such as projectile points, knives, or other cutting tools through knapping, or breaking off pieces in a controlled manner, such as pressure flaking.\n\nObsidian obeys the property of mineral hydration, and absorbs water, when exposed to air, at well defined rate. When an unworked nodule of obsidian is initially fractured, there is typically less than 1% water present. Over time, water slowly diffuses into the artifact forming a narrow \"band,\" \"rim,\" or \"rind\" that can be seen and measured with many different techniques such as a high-power microscope with 40–80 power magnification, depth profiling with SIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry), and IR-PAS (infra red photoacoustic spectroscopy). In order to use obsidian hydration for absolute dating, the conditions that the sample has been exposed to and its origin must be understood or compared to samples of a known age (e.g. as a result of radiocarbon dating of associated materials).\n\nObsidian hydration dating was introduced in 1960 by Irving Friedman and Robert Smith of the U.S. Geological Survey. Their initial work focused on obsidians from archaeological sites in western North America.\n\nThe use of Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in the measurement of obsidian hydration dating was introduced by two independent research teams in 2002.\n\nToday the technique is applied extensively by archaeologists to date prehistoric sites and sites from prehistory in California and the Great Basin of North America. It has also been applied in South America, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, including New Zealand and Mediterranean Basin.\n\nTo measure the hydration band, a small slice of material is typically cut from an artifact. This sample is ground down to about 30 micrometers thick and mounted on a petrographic slide (this is called a thin section). The hydration rind is then measured under a high-power microscope outfitted with some method for measuring distance, typically in tenths of micrometers. The technician measures the microscopic amount of water absorbed on freshly broken surfaces. The principle behind obsidian hydration dating is simple–the longer the artifact surface has been exposed, the thicker the hydration band will be.\n\nIn case of measuring the hydration rim using the depth profiling ability of the secondary ion mass spectrometry technique, the sample is mounted on a holder without any preparation or cutting. This method of measurement is non-destructive.\nThere are two general SIMS modes: static mode and dynamic mode, depending on the primary ion current density, and three different types of mass spectrometers: magnetic sector, quadrupole and time-of-flight (TOF).\nAny mass-spectrometer can work in static mode (very low ion current, a top mono-atomic layer analysis), and dynamic mode (a high ion current density, in-depth analysis).\n\nAlthough relatively infrequent the use of SIMS on obsidian surface investigations has produced great progress in OHD dating. SIMS in general refers to four instrumental categories according to their operation; static, dynamic, quadrupole, and time-of-flight, TOF. In essence it is a technique with a large resolution on a plethora of chemical elements and molecular structures in an essentially non destructive manner. An approach to OHD with a completely new rationale suggests that refinement of the technique is possible in a manner which improves both its accuracy and precision and potentially expands the utility by generating reliable chronological data. Anovitz et al. presented a model which relied solely on compositionally-dependent diffusion, following numerical solutions (finite difference (FD), or finite element) elaborating on the H+ profile acquired by SIMS. A test of the model followed using results from Mount 65, Chalco in Mexico by Riciputi et al. This technique used numerical calculation to model the formation of the entire diffusion profile as a function of time and fitted the derived curve to the hydrogen profile. The FD equations are based on a number of assumptions about the behavior of water as it diffused into the glass and characteristic points of the SIMS H+ diffusion profile.\n\nIn Rhodes, Greece, under the direction and invention of Ioannis Liritzis,\nthe dating approach is based on modeling the S-like hydrogen profile by SIMS, following Fick's diffusion law, and an understanding of the surface saturation layer (see Figure). In fact, the saturation layer on the surface forms up to a certain depth depending on factors that include the kinetics of the diffusion mechanism for the water molecules, the specific chemical structure of obsidian, as well as the external conditions affecting diffusion (temperature, relative humidity, and pressure). Together these factors result in the formation of an approximately constant, boundary concentration value, in the external surface layer. Using the end product of diffusion, a phenomenological model has been developed, based on certain initial and boundary conditions and appropriate physicochemical mechanisms, that express the HO concentration versus depth profile as a diffusion/time equation.\n\nThis latest advance, the novel secondary ion mass spectrometry–surface saturation (SIMS-SS), thus, involves modelling the hydrogen concentration profile of the surface versus depth, whereas the age determination is reached via equations describing the diffusion process, while topographical effects have been confirmed and monitored through atomic force microscopy.\n\nSeveral factors complicate simple correlation of obsidian hydration band thickness with absolute age. Temperature is known to speed up the hydration process. Thus, artifacts exposed to higher temperatures, for example by being at lower elevation, seem to hydrate faster. As well, obsidian chemistry, including the intrinsic water content, seems to affect the rate of hydration. Once an archeologist can control for the geochemical signature of the obsidian (e.g., the \"source\") and temperature (usually approximated using an \"effective hydration temperature\" or EHT coefficient), he or she may be able to date the artifact using the obsidian hydration technique. Water vapor pressure may also affect the rate of obsidian hydration.\n\nThe reliability of the method based on Friedman's empirical age equation (\"x²=kt\", where \"x\" is the thickness of the hydration rim, \"k\" is the diffusion coefficient, and \"t\" is the time) is questioned from several grounds regarding temperature dependence, square root of time and determination of diffusion rate per sample and per site, apart of some successful attempts on the procedure and applications.The SIMS-SS age calculation procedure is separated into two major steps. The first step concerns the calculation of a 3rd order fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile (eq.1). The second stage regards the determination of the saturation layer, i.e. its depth and concentration. The whole computing processing is embedded in stand-alone software created in Matlab (version 7.0.1) software package with a graphical user interface and executable under Windows XP. Thus, the SIMS-SS age equation in years before present is given in eq.2:\n\nformula_1<br>\nEq.1 Fitting polynomial of the SIMS profile\n\nformula_2<br>Eq.2 The SIMS-SS age equation in years before present\n\nWhere, Ci is the intrinsic concentration of water, Cs is the saturation concentration, dC/dx is the diffusion coefficient for depth x=0, k is derived from a family of Crank's theoretical diffusion curves, and Ds,eff is an effective diffusion coefficient (eq.3) which relates the inverse gradient of the fit polynomial to well dated samples:\n\nwhere Ds = (1/(dC/dx))10 assuming a constant flux and taken as unity. The eq.(2) and assumption of unity is a matter of further investigation.\n\nSeveral commercial companies and university laboratories provide obsidian hydration services.\n\n\n\n"}

Wolff won the United States Chess Championship in 1992 and 1995.\n\nIn addition to his two United States championships (1992 and 1995), Wolff also had a distinguished scholastic chess career, winning the 1983 National High School Championship and the 1987 U.S. Junior Championship.\n\nIn 1988, in a game played in New York City, Wolff defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov during a simultaneous exhibition in just 25 moves with the black pieces:1.c4 e5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 c6 4.d4 exd4 5.Qxd4 d5 6.cxd5 cxd5 7.Nf3 Nc6 8.Qa4 Be7 9.0-0 0-0 10.Be3 Ng4 11.Bd4 Nxd4 12.Nxd4 Qb6 13.Nc3 Qh6 14.h4 g5 15.Nxd5 Bd8 16.Rac1 gxh4 17.Rxc8 hxg3 18.Nf3 Nh2 19.Rfc1 Rxc8 20.Rxc8 Nxf3+ 21.exf3 gxf2+ 22.Kf1 Qd2 23.Nf6+ Kg7 24.Ne8+ Kh8 25.Qe4 Bh4 0–1\n\nThis game, although played as part of a simultaneous exhibition against five other masters, was one of Kasparov's shortest losses in his career. \n\nIn 1995, the same year he won his second United States championship, Wolff served as a second to challenger Viswanathan Anand in preparation for the Classical World Chess Championship 1995 match against champion Kasparov. Although Anand led the match after nine games, Kasparov eventually prevailed 10.5 to 7.5. \n\nWolff is also the author of the \"Complete Idiot's Guide to Chess\". He graduated from Harvard College in 1996, and the trophy of the annual Harvard-Yale intercollegiate chess match is named the Wolff Cup in his honor, as he remains the only grandmaster to participate in the match as a member of both colleges (beginning at Yale and graduating from Harvard).\n\nWolff was previously a managing director at San Francisco hedge fund Clarium, which is a $3B global macro hedge fund. He left Clarium to launch Grandmaster Capital Management, a hedge fund that received seed capital from Peter Thiel, the founder of Clarium and a strong chess player himself. \n\nHedge Fund Alert reported that Wolff started the wind-down process of Grandmaster Capital in June 2015.\n\nOver the past several years, Wolff has given a blindfolded simultaneous exhibition for all-comers at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska headed by CEO Warren Buffett and Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger.\n\n"}

During that period he became good friends with RZA's younger brother 9th Prince and they would later form the group Killarmy. He went from rapping in the survival dorms of C-74 and C-76 in Riker’s Island Correctional Facility, while completing his juvenile bid for Gun possession and Assault charges, to making a name for himself locally in the slums of Staten Island's then small hip hop circles in the early 1990s. \nExperiencing three successful major releases (two through Priority Records, and one through Loud Records) with a debut album that cracked the top ten billboard charts, three world tours with Wu-Tang Clan and countless features on gold albums such as RZA’s first Bobby Digital project and \"\" compilation. Riding off the success of his last group album in 2002, Pachino established his own independent record company called Napalm Recordings, which he released a slew of underground mix tapes and albums via online, mom and pop record stores, and digitally.

The land upon which part of the town sits was homesteaded by Joseph L. Johnston. It sits on the northwest corner of the land Johnson had acquired with a government claim in 1904, three years before Oklahoma became a state.\n\nWith the construction of Highway Three across Oklahoma during the Great Depression, Tom Lemmons, who had bought the Johnson homestead, moved a chicken coop to where the highway passed his land. In the chicken coop, he started a store. He told the \"Tulsa Tribune\" he had nothing else to do during the depression, so he thought he'd start a town. He named his town Nye, after the Progressive U.S. Senator Gerald Nye (R-ND).\n\nThe name Slapout, according to local legend, came about because customers at the store in Nye were often told by Lemmon's sister that the store was \"slapout\" of whatever they wanted. Tom Lemmons insisted his sister never used the phrase. However, the name stuck. When Tom continued to insist his side of the highway was called Nye, patrons responded that the south side of the highway could be \"Slapout\", and that the north side with Lemmon's store could be \"Nye Out.\"\n\nTom Lemmons finally gave in when a tornado came through town and only took out his Nye sign. After that, both sides were known as Slapout. At one time, the town had 10 inhabitants and included the Hagan Grocery on the south side of the highway. Lemmons also built a building to house his rock collection.\n\nToday, the gas station in the town is a regular stop for Tulsa and Oklahoma City skiers traveling to Colorado.\n\nThe town was featured in a newspaper photo essay by Robert R. Mercer in the \"Tulsa Tribune\" in the 1970s.\n\n\nMercer, Robert R.; photojournalist & chair, journalism department, Cypress College, Cypress, CA\n"}

Stick-style architecture is recognizable by the relatively plain layout, often accented with trusses on the gables or decorative shingles.\n\nThe stickwork decoration is not structurally significant, being just narrow planks or thin projections applied over the wall's clapboards. The planks intersect mostly at right angles, and sometimes diagonally as well, resembling the half-timbering of medieval – especially Tudor – buildings.\n\nThe style was commonly used in houses, train stations, life-saving stations, and other buildings from the era.\n\nThe Stick style did have several characteristics in common with the later Queen Anne style: interpenetrating roof planes with bold panelled brick chimneys, the wrap-around porch, spindle detailing, the \"panelled\" sectioning of blank wall, radiating spindle details at the gable peaks. Highly stylized and decorative versions of the Stick style are often referred to as Eastlake.\n\nStick-Eastlake is a style term that uses details from the Eastlake Movement, started by Charles Eastlake, of decorative arts on Stick-style buildings. It is sometimes referred to as Victorian Stick, a variation of Stick and Eastlake styles. Stick-Eastlake enjoyed modest popularity in the late 19th century, but there are relatively few surviving examples of the style when compared to other more popular styles of Victorian architecture.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as a member of Sunz of Man, an early affiliate group of the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nRazah is rumored to have suffered a brain aneurysm in April 2010. He was quick to recover and continue recording. He came to adopt the moniker Heaven Razah.\n\nRazah made his rap debut in the early 90s as a member of the group Da Last Future, an early incarnation of the Sunz of Man, which included Killah Priest, Shabazz the Disciple, Prodigal Sunn, Supreme and 7th Ambassador. Razah and 7th Ambassador self-released the single \"Livin' in Hell\" b/w \"Mental Combat\" independently before the group adopted the Sunz of Man moniker. Razah recorded a number of tracks with the group before their induction into the Wu-Tang family, including \"Deep in the Water\", \"Writing Rhymes With a Liquid Pen\" (aka \"Elements\"), \"Lulla Bye\" and \"Psychic Hotline\".\n\nIn 1995, the group adopted the moniker Sunz of Man, and signed a record deal with Wu-Tang/Priority Records. SoM released a number of singles on Wu-Tang Records, including \"Soldiers of Darkness\", \"No Love Without Hate\" and \"Bloody Choices\", in anticipation of their 1996 debut album \"Nothing New Under the Sun\". Due to internal conflicts and label complications, the album was shelved. Sunz of Man later signed a record deal with Red Ant Entertainment for the release of their official 1998 debut \"The Last Shall Be First\", with the group's roster shaved down to just Razah, Killah Priest, Prodigal Sunn and 60 Second Assassin. The album was one of the most successful Wu-Tang affiliate releases, debuting at No. 20 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, and No. 7 on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart.\n\nAfter the departure of Killah Priest in 1998, the group took a hiatus. 1999 saw the release of \"The First Testament\", which featured previously recorded material from the group, including the early tracks from Da Last Future. Razah, Prodigal Sunn and 60 Second Assassin returned in 2002 with the album \"Saviorz Day\", the second official Sunz of Man studio album. The group has yet to release a third studio album, but it has been reported that the group has reconciled with Shabazz the Disciple, Killah Priest and Supreme.\n\nRazah made his solo debut in 2001, though quietly, with the independent release \"When All Hell Breaks Loose\". The album featured guest appearances from 7th Ambassador, Killah Priest, Prodigal Sunn and Timbo King of Royal Fam, and production from Supreme. The album spawned the single \"Champaigne Room\" b/w \"Ghetto Love\". The tracks \"Must B tha Music\", \"Oh! Now You Bangin'\", \"Ghetto Government\", \"Champaigne Room\", \"Like It or Not\", \"What We Came to Do\", \"B.B.P. (Business Before Pleasure)\" and \"Rowdy, Rowdy\" made up roughly half of the 2004 Sunz of Man compilation \"Elements\", with the other half made up of tracks from \"The First Testament\".\n\nRazah's next solo album, \"Renaissance Child\", was released in early 2007 on Nature Sounds Records. The album featured appearances from Timbo King, Tragedy Khadafi, R.A. The Rugged Man, Talib Kweli, Viktor Vaughn, Bronze Nazareth, Killah Priest and Ras Kass, and production from Godz Wrath, MF DOOM, Bronze Nazareth, Krohme and 4th Disciple. The album was a well-received, critical success and featured the singles \"The Renaissance\" and \"Buried Alive\" b/w \"Project Jazz\".\nIn October 2007, Razah released his next album, \"Razah's Ladder\", entirely produced by the production duo Blue Sky Black Death. The album also was acclaimed, due to BSBD's soulful production work, and also to Razah's new spiritual lyrical direction, inspired by the recent death of his father. The album featured guest appearances from Prodigal Sunn, Shabazz the Disciple, Crooked I, Ill Bill and Sabac Red, and featured no singles. Self-funded videos were shot for the tracks \"Razah's Ladder\" and \"Audiobiography\", the latter directed by Sunz of Man producer Supreme, and \"Razah's Ladder\",\n\nIn 2004, Hell Razah and 4th Disciple released a full-length collaboration album, \"Freedom of Speech\", under the title \"Sunz of Man presents\". The album featured fifteen newly recorded tracks with 4th Disciple, and five other previously released tracks from \"When All Hell Breaks Loose\". The album featured the single \"Article One\" b/w \"Project Love\".\n\nIn 2005, Razah, Killah Priest, Royal Fam's Timbo King, Tragedy Khadafi and William Cooper formed the underground supergroup Black Market Militia. The group released their self-titled debut album \"Black Market Militia\" that same year, with production from Godz Wrath and Bronze Nazareth, and guest appearances from dead prez and Abiodun Oyewole of The Last Poets. The album spawned the singles \"Audobon Ballroom\" b/w \"Thug Nation\"/\"Hood Lullabye\" and \"Gem Stars\" b/w \"Mayday!\". Razah's next album collaboration album was with Shabazz the Disciple and producer Ayatollah as the group T.H.U.G. Angelz, titled \"Welcome to Red Hook Houses\", to be released on July 8, 2008 on Babygrande Records. Other releases came in 2008 such as solo album titled \"Heaven Razah\", and \"Article 2: Right to Bare Arms\", a second full-length collaboration with 4th Disciple. In an October 2007 interview, Razah also announced plans for numerous other releases for the year. He announced that the Sunz of Man were reunited and planned on releasing an album sometime soon. He also stated that The Maccabeez, a group consisting of himself, Killah Priest and Timbo King, were nearly finished recording their debut album. Black Market Militia are also planning for another album. Another possible release is a collaboration between Razah, Shabazz and Blue Sky Black Death, and a project from G.G.O. (Ghetto Government Officialz), which consists of Razah, 7th Ambassador, Lazarus, Face God and other Red Hook locals.\n\nHell Razah suffered a Brain Aneurysm in 2010. After surviving that near death experience, he began to go under the name \"Heaven Razah\".\n\nIn 2011, Hell Razah's health was improving and he said on Twitter several albums will come out in the future, including Heaven Razah 2, the second album with Shabazz the Disciple as T.H.U.G. Angelz (produced by Ayatollah and 4th Disciple), Razah's Ladder 2 produced by Blue Sky Black Death, a gospel/rock album produced by Krohme called Krohme Razahs, an album with Shyheim called The Verrazano and the sequel to \"Freedom of Speech\" called Write to Bare Arms produced by 4th Disciple. An album with Killah Priest as Thug Vaticans called The Lamb’s Supper will come out in 2013. Another collaboration album, with producer Tokyo Cigar under the name Heavenly Cartel, is planned for 2013 and is called Spiritual Kung Fu. He's also doing an album with producer Bronze Nazareth. He also started a hiphop/soul group together with producer Shroom and singer Tarone Rachamim called \"The Dutch\" and they are planning to release their first album in the future, which is called Music from the Heart.\n\n\"Heaven Razah Part 2\" became \"Living After Death\" and was released on iTunes on March 31, 2013. In May, Hell Razah announced the formal roster of his new label, Hell Razah Music Inc. to include Razah's oldest son \"Heaven Sun\" aka Yung Razah, Queen the Prophet, Scripture, and a few more to formally represent Razah's long time \"Ghetto Govt\" global movement also known as \"GGO\" (Ghetto Govt Officialz). The Ghetto Govt Movement has global chapters that are dedicated to making a positive impact in their communities as well as in the underground hip-hop community.\n\nRazah released the album \"El' Raziel\" in April 2015 and is currently in the process of wrapping up Risen: The Story of Chron “Hell Razah” Smith which is a documentary directed by Frank Meyer and stars Wu Tang’s RZA, Cappadonna and Popa Wu, Sunz of Man members Killah Priest, Prodigal Sunn, 60-Second Assassin and Shabazz the Disciple, producers A.

In 1956-7, he wrote scripts for the Canadian television series Radisson and also wrote the lyrics to the theme song. He then worked for a period selling encyclopedias door-to-door until troubled by his conscience for selling things to people they didn't really want or need. He moved back to England where he had a prolific career. He created the television series \"Operation Patch\" (later novelised), \"The Ravelled Thread\", and \"The Panther's Leap\".

Portrayed by Eileen Derbyshire, the character is the longest-standing female character in the serial, having first appeared on-screen during an episode which aired on 27 January 1961. Derbyshire announced in November 2015 that she would be taking a sabbatical from the show and Emily departed on 1 January 2016 after 55 years on screen. Although the door has been left open for the actress. It was announced on 9 August 2019 that Derbyshire had agreed to briefly reprise the role. She made a brief cameo on 9 October 2019 for Ken Barlow's (William Roache) 80th birthday celebration.\n\nEmily first moved to Weatherfield in the late 1940s from Harrogate to work for Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe) at the Glad Tidings Mission Hall. A very quiet and Christian woman, she hardly knew anyone up on the street except Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) the caretaker of the Mission Hall and the owners of the Corner Shop, Elsie Lappin (Maudie Edwards) and then Florrie Lindley (Betty Alberge). She eventually meets the residents of the street following a gas leak in January 1961 which forced them to stay the night at the Mission Hall. After that she soon becomes friends with many of the residents and became a pillar of the community.\n\nSwindley soon ventures out becoming manager of the Rosamand Street branch of Gamma Garments, a clothing chain with Emily as his head assistant, their relationship becomes stronger and they decide to get married; however, Swindley's pompousness and arrogance forces her to jilt him at the altar. A very moral woman, Emily prides herself on saving herself for marriage, but her resolve is eventually weakened and she begins a relationship with a Hungarian man called Miklos Zadic (Paul Stassino). She later confides in her friend Valerie Barlow (Anne Reid) that she has no regrets about the encounter; Emily is, by that time, 39 years old and assumes it will be now or never. With Miklos out of the picture, Emily falls in love with mild-mannered Ernest Bishop (Stephen Hancock) after meeting him at his mother's funeral in 1969. Their courtship is tested many times over and lasts for three years. They get engaged in 1971. The next year, Ernest is jailed while in Majorca; when he is subsequently freed, Emily and Ernest decide to get married. The wedding was broadcast across the UK on Easter Monday (3 April 1972).\n\nDespite rough patches, Emily and Ernest's marriage is relatively stable and they love each other very much. Emily miscarries and later starts menopause, dashing their chances of having a child of their own. This leads to many arguments between them, and they are forced to re-evaluate their marriage after just two years. They turn to short-term fostering to assuage Emily's need to connect with young children. Tragedy strikes when Ernest is shot and killed in a botched robbery, leaving Emily devastated. Emily only starts to heal from heartbreak by playing with a baby, namely Deirdre Langton's (Anne Kirkbride) infant daughter Tracy (Christabel Finch). To occupy her time more interestingly, Emily leaves her post at the local hospital and becomes manager of a café, with Gail Potter (Helen Worth) as her assistant. When the cafe is abruptly sold and new owner Jim Sedgwick (Michael O'Hagan) makes drastic changes to the food and service, Emily walks out and Gail takes over, although eventually Jim's wife Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) starts managing the cafe. In many respects, Emily has never let Ernest go but does marry again, to Arnold Swain (George Waring). He unfortunately turns out to be a bigamist. After she ends their relationship, he visits her and plans a murder-suicide. Emily tells him that God would not approve of what he is doing but Arnold insists she is wrong and goes upstairs to find a Bible. While he is gone, Emily runs outside for help. Arnold is sent to an institution where he dies ten months later. When factory boss Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) needs a new wages clerk, he turns to Emily and she starts working in the same job held by her husband at the time of his death.\n\nIn June 1992, Emily has a mental breakdown. She can't remember appointments, becomes confused and her appearance suffers. Lodger Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington), protects her, covering up these very unusual actions. He becomes increasingly concerned about her behaviour and alerts Emily's friends and neighbours. One day, Emily disappears without a word. When friends and neighbours ignore Percy's call for help, he calls the police who find Emily wandering aimlessly, clearly having suffered a breakdown. When Emily has recovered enough to leave hospital, she tells Percy that he is a good friend, and thanks him for all he had done. Percy later leaves. Emily falls in love once more, with Bernard, a vicar. He breaks off the engagement when he finds out she had suffered a mental breakdown. Because of his own past mental conditions, he cannot face the possibility of it recurring. Since then, Emily has sworn off love completely, pushing herself into more topical endeavours instead. When her nephew Spider (Martin Hancock) arrives on the scene, Emily takes him in and they become fast friends as well as partners in saving the Red Rec from Alf Roberts' (Bryan Mosley) proposed plans for a \"Millennium Bowl\". Emily spends a night up in a tree standing by her convictions that the Red Rec is the last green space in Weatherfield and it deserves preservation.\n\nRichard Hillman (Brian Capron), Gail's husband, attempts to murder Emily for monetary reasons. He breaks in while she is watching television and babysitting for Ashley (Steven Arnold) and Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw). Richard knocks her unconscious with a crowbar but is interrupted by Maxine's early return. He attacks Maxine with the same weapon, killing her instantly. Emily makes a full recovery but suffers terrible guilt for surviving when Maxine didn't. She prevents a murder when grief-crazed Brenda Fearns (Julia Deakin) almost jumps off a forty-three foot church tower with baby Bethany Platt (Amy & Emily Walton).\n\nEmily befriends Ed Jackson (Chris Walker), a new member of the congregation at her church. He soon becomes a regular visitor to her house, doing odd jobs and they remain friends after he confesses that he has recently been released from prison. However, Emily is devastated when Ed admits why he has been in prison—he was the man who shot and killed Ernest. He tells her that, after finding God while in prison, he has come looking for her, attempting to atone for his misdemeanours. Enraged, Emily throws him out, and goes on to question her faith. Eventually, Emily forgives Ed as he contemplates suicide, and gives him Ernest's camera as a keepsake, asking him to send her a photo of him every year so that she can make sure he is alive and well.\n\nWhen Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) finds an envelope in Emily's drawer while looking to see what her PIN was when she has forgotten it. The envelope reads: \"to be opened after my death\". Norris tells Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) about it and she tells Emily about the situation so Emily agrees to tell Norris. She makes him promise not to tell anyone but it turns out that the envelope contains plans for her funeral. Norris discovers that this envelope isn't the one he has seen and tries hard to find out what really is in the envelope. It is revealed to be old photos of Rita from her singing days. Emily encounters Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope), a former resident of the street, when she is working at the canteen at Weatherfield General Hospital. Taking pity on him as he has no home to go to, Emily invites him to come and lodge with her and Norris. When Jed later goes missing, Emily is worried as he has left his cap behind. When Maria Connor (Samia Ghadie) returns from holiday she is surprised to learn that Jed has disappeared as they both had believed Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) was a killer. After Maria accuses Tony of killing Jed both Maria and Emily are relieved when Jed turns up \"unharmed\" but Jed is really hiding marks on his neck from when Tony had strangled him. Emily is later upset to hear that Jed has suffered a second heart attack after he receives a visit from Tony's henchman.\n\nNorris' half-brother Ramsay Clegg (Andrew Sachs) arrives after them not seeing each for many years. Emily tries to get Norris to forgive Ramsay before his return to Australia, and in doing so begins to fall for the man. She is very upset when he departs the Street, and is later shocked when he dies suddenly on his flight. She condemns Norris for treating Ramsay in the cold manner that he did. Emily later forgives Norris for his treatment of Ramsay. Emily took in Tracy (now played by Kate Ford) and her daughter Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney) as lodgers in her front parlour, after they were made homeless. However, she kicks them out after Tracy deliberately ruins Ernest's pair of shoes believing them to be Norris'. Emily told Norris of her ambition to do charity work in Peru and to see her nephew, Spider again, she booked a flight and she departed the street.\n\nIn early 2018, Ken Barlow (William Roache) told Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent) that Emily was back in the country, to look after a sick Freda. Ken told Sophie that they might see Emily back in Weatherfield soon. In April, Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) mentions to her son Jude Appleton (Paddy Wallace) and his wife Angie (Victoria Ekanoye) that Norris has visited Emily in Scotland. On 9 October 2019, Emily spoke to Ken via Skype to wish him a happy 80th birthday.\n\nIn December 1960, actress Eileen Derbyshire was approached by Granada to play a part in the show, but the actress was tied up in a Christmas stage play. Of this Derbyshire said: \"Four weeks after it started (airing) they said I could either wait until they introduced a new family into the programme or take the tiny part of a little, shy woman helper at the Mission Hall\" going on to say \"I have always been a fatalist, so I took the bird in one hand, not realising what a momentous decision I was making\".\n\nThe character of Emily was introduced when actress Eileen Derbyshire took on the role in Episode 15 on Friday, 27 January. At first, the character was simply called \"Miss Nugent\"; it wasn't until 1962 that she was given the name \"Emily\" by the show's writers. She continued to be credited on the programme as \"Miss Nugent\" until 1969.\n\nAlthough rarely seen, the set of Emily's kitchen is the oldest surviving set. (The second oldest set is Ken's kitchen, with the famous avocado-green tiles.) All other sets have been redecorated at least once since we first saw Emily's kitchen. Emily's back room/parlour, however, was redecorated off screen. In the story a fire was caused by a candle left unattended by Spider and Toyah when they made their way upstairs after a romantic evening. Spider was able to track down matching wallpaper to cover up the fire damage so that Emily would not know what had happened, but in reality, the wallpaper was no longer obtainable, so the whole set was re-decorated in a very similar style. Emily has lived at No. 3 Coronation Street since 1972. It is mentioned that Emily is from Harrogate.\n\nDuring an interview in 1991, Derbyshire spoke about her character's thirty years in the show, stating: \"The writers have a tough enough task as it is, trying to find new storylines for a character who has been in the serial for three decades.\" Going on to say \"I just get on with it. Emily has had a more colourful past than you might think. She has had lots of men friends and liaisons. In the early days, when they were stuck for something to do with her, I think the writers used to say 'Let's give Emily another boyfriend.' I've lost count of the number of men friends she has had\".\n\nOver the years, the character has proved her good neighbour image by taking in a number of lodgers, most notably Percy Sugden, Curly Watts, her nephew Spider, Rita Tanner and current lodger Norris Cole.\n\nIn November 2015, \"Coronation Street\" confirmed that Derbyshire had requested a six-month break with immediate effect, which she was granted. Derbyshire was one of four cast members to announce their temporary exit around the same time as Alison King who plays Carla Connor, David Neilson who plays Roy Cropper and Les Dennis who plays Michael Rodwell also announced that they would be temporarily departing. Derbyshire's exit scenes aired on 1 January 2016 in which Emily left the street to visit her nephew Spider (Martin Hancock).\n\nDerbyshire later extended her leave until the end of 2016. In November 2016, it was reported that Derbyshire would not be reprising the role. A source told \"The Sun\" that there was \"no expectation that she will be back\". They went on to say: \"All of her cast mates have accepted she won't be returning. She's 85 and has been out of the show for a year, so she probably would have found it tough to get back into the fast pace of filming.\" However, a spokesperson later said the door is still open for her when she is ready, saying: \"Eileen is taking an extended break, and has given no indication that she doesn't plan to return.\"\n\nDuring an episode broadcast on 3 January 2018, Ken Barlow remarked to Sophie Webster that Emily had returned to the UK to look after her niece Freda, who had fallen ill. This led to speculation that the character would soon be returning to the show.\n\nIn April 2019, producer Iain MacLeod stated that there are no plans to bring Emily back at the moment, but the door will be left open for a possible future return.\nHowever four months later on 9 August 2019, it was announced that Derbyshire had agreed to return briefly to reprise her role as Emily Bishop. She appeared in the first episode on 9 October 2019 in a special video message to Ken Barlow to mark his 80th birthday.\n\nIn 2001, a storyline involving Emily lending her nephew Spider £15,000 for a new business venture was criticised for not being authentic. Journalist Tony Bridgland writing for the \"Telegraph\" said of the plot; \"It is beginning to look as though \"Coronation Street\"'s researchers failed to do enough homework to make their plot watertight.\" \"The Guardian\" compiled a list of ten favourite Christmas moments from soap; on the list was the 2002 Christmas episode where Richard Hillman came close to suffocating Emily with a pillow as she slept.\n\nDiscussing the scene where Emily was attacked by Richard Hillman in 2003, critic Chris Diamond wryly commented: \"Surely Emily wouldn't be in the line of fire? Poor, drippy, sensible shoes Emily? But she was and the scene where Richard laid the blow on her was one of the most genuinely shocking things I have ever seen on television. I just couldn't believe my eyes. And that was where the genius of the episode lay. I knew Emily was going to get it. I saw Richard creeping up behind her and I was fully cognisant of the fact that the crowbar in his hand was not for snagging her cardie. But I was sure that even at this point something was going to happen that would divert Richard from his target. When the blow actually fell I was utterly amazed.\"\n\nDek Hogan writing for media website \"Digital Spy\" in 2005 praised Eileen Derbyshire's comedic abilities; \"the book club storyline doesn't exactly fill me with joy but does have the advantage of giving some fine comedic material to the underused talents of Eileen Derbyshire. As Emily Bishop she has shown a major flair for these scenes in the past.\" In 2006, writer Eve-Marie Wilson in an article criticised the plot which saw Emily forgiving her husband's killer: \"...on \"Coronation Street\" recently, Emily Bishop was having a crisis of conscience, could she or couldn’t she forgive Ed, the man who had killed her husband all those years ago. After two or three episodes the matter was resolved. Had that incident occurred on a soap opera she’d still be undecided six months later!\"\n\nIn 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture commented that Emily is underused in storylines, but praised her stating: \"Emily is one of those characters who seems to have always been around but rarely gets singled out for attention, yet she can be both funny and heartbreaking. She's really stood out in her scenes this month and has been the only good thing about the Norris/Ramsay storyline of infinite tedium.\" In the book \"Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps\", Christine Geraghty describes Emily as being \"shy, frightened of speaking out until roused, a spinster type whose complex marital history is seldom referred to\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188990", "title": "L&amp;M", "text": "L&amp;M\n\nL&M is an American brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Altria (previously known as Philip Morris Companies, Inc.). The name comes from the tobacco company founded in 1873 called Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, predecessor of today's Liggett Group in which L&M was originally produced.\n\n\"L&M\" was launched in 1885 by Liggett & Myers as a plug chewing tobacco. In 1952 or 1953, the first L&M cigarettes were created and they were one of the earliest, perhaps the earliest brand to have a filter that was not a one-sided filter. When \"L&M\" was launched, their motto was \"\"American cigarettes of the highest quality with the best filter\"\". When their success in the American market was solidified, Liggett Group made a proposal to take the brand international. In 1999, the L&M trademark rights were acquired by the largest tobacco company in the United States, Philip Morris, and are still produced by them today.\n\nThe brand is popular in Latin America, central and northern Europe, the Arab World and the far east and south Asia. They were not very common in the continental US until a new roll out made them available in October 2007. According to the information of the independent agency of field investigation \"Business Analytics\", the second quarter of 2007, Phillip Morris brands took the first place in 25 Russian cities with a market share of 29.92%.\n\nDuring a press conference, it was reported that \"L&M\" takes third place in the world by sales volume. Also, the \"L&M\" brand took second place among other cigarette brands produced by Phillip Morris International. Due to the labeling regulations in Europe banning the use of the word 'lights', the names used to indicate the strength of the cigarettes had been changed, e.g., L&M Lights are now called L&M Blue Label. The same happened in 2010 in the U.S. when the Food and Drug Administration banned flavour descriptors—such as \"mild,\" \"light\" and \"ultra light\"—even though the color designations were already changed like in Europe.\n\nIn December 1997, the ingredients that go into L&M cigarettes were displayed on the cartons. In addition to blended tobacco and water, the 26 ingredients that go into L&M cigarettes include molasses, phenylacetic acid and oil of patchouli.\n\nL&M was the fourth largest cigarette brand in the world, with 92 billion cigarettes produced in 2007. In 2016, L&M had a volume of 97 billion produced cigarettes. It is the third best-selling international cigarette brand outside the United States and China.\n\nOver the years, Liggett & Myers made many poster and magazine advertisements to promote the brand, which included famous slogans such as \"\"No cigarette ever went so far so fast!\"\". Hollywood celebrities such as Barbara Stanwyck, Rosalind Russell and Fredric March starred in various print advertisement to promote the brand by claiming that L&M filters were \"\"Just what the doctor ordered!\"\".\n\nVarious TV advertisements were also created. The most known ones were the \"\"Just What The Doctor Ordered\"\", \"\"Live Modern\"\", \"\"Stay Fresh, Stay Fresh With L&M\"\", and \"\"Come On Over To The L&M Side\"\" ads.\n\nL&M cigarettes are sold in the United States, Mexico, Ireland, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Poland, India, Czech Republic, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Israel, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates, Thailand Guatemala, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nIn the 1950s, L&M introduced an ad campaign called \"\"Just What The Doctor Ordered!\"\". This campaign came at the time L&M introduced the first filtered cigarette that became popular. In these L&M advertisements from the early 1950s, \"\"just what the doctor ordered\"\" had a double-meaning. Not only did it imply that L&M cigarettes were satisfying in that they offered both flavour and protection, but it also implied that doctors approved of the brand, a testament to the brand's healthfulness. In a typical advertisement that appeared in a February 1954 issue of Life magazine, Hollywood star Fredric March made an assertion after having read the letter written by a \"\"Dr Darkis\"\" that was inset into the advertisement. Darkis explained in this letter that L&M filters used a \"\"highly purified alpha cellulose\"\" that was \"\"entirely harmless\"\" and \"\"effectively filtered the smoke\"\".\n\nSimilar contemporaneous advertisements from Viceroy claimed that their filtered cigarettes were healthy because doctors recommended Viceroys to patients. Obviously, these ads claimed health benefits for filters, though filters actually did little to truly reduce the hazards of smoking. In fact, tobacco industry chemists were well aware that most filters actually removed no more tar and nicotine than would the same length of tobacco. However, a series of Reader's Digest articles worked to publicize these dubious health claims for filters in the 1950s.\n\nOne such article, entitled \"\"How Harmful are Cigarettes?\"\" (1950), noted that artificial filters took out some nicotine since people were aware that nicotine was a killer. The article stated that silica-gel cartridges removed 60% of nicotine from cigarettes. This article spurred Viceroy to print advertisements a week later which read: \"\"Reader's Digest tells why filtered cigarette smoke is better for your health.\"\" These health claims sparked a boom in Viceroy cigarette sales as well as an onslaught of new filter cigarette brands flooding the market. Kent was introduced in 1952 with a filter made of treated asbestos on crepe paper. In 1953, L&M followed with a miracle tip and Philip Morris advertised its di-ethylene glycol (Di-Gl) filter cigarette as the cigarette that took the fear out of smoking. In the next two years, Marlboro was re-released as a filter cigarette which targeted men (it had previously been a cigarette targeting women, with a beauty tip to protect the lips), and Winston was introduced with an advertising budget of $15 million.\n\nOn July 21, 2011, the Bulgarian customs authorities and Phillip Morris Bulgaria representatives organized the destruction of over 7 million counterfeit cigarettes bearing the mark L&M. The destroyed cigarettes were part of over 14.5 million cigarettes seized by the Bulgarian customs officials in September 2010 and February 2011 at the border checkpoints Kulata and Ilinden, southwestern Bulgaria. Bulgaria’s Customs Agency and Philip Morris Bulgaria had signed a cooperation agreement aimed at fighting the illicit trade of tobacco products. L&M cigarettes made 3 percent of all seized cigarettes in Bulgaria in 2010 and 9 percent of all seized cigarettes during the first five months of 2011.\n\nL&M was the sponsor for Carl Haas Racing from the 1970 Can-Am season to the 1971 Can-Am season.\n\nL&M sponsored one of the Ducati bikes that Ben Bostrom drove in 2001 and 2002. The company also sponsored the Derbi factory team competing in the 2001 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season on the 125cc class.\n\nL&M, as well as Kellogg's, were the main sponsors of the Hotel de Paree television show from October 2, 1959, until June 3, 1960.\n\nGunsmoke, even advertised off-camera by Matt Dillon (James Arness) and Doc Adams (Milburn Stone)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2188994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2188994", "title": "Billy Meyer", "text": "Billy Meyer\n\nWilliam Adam Meyer (January 14, 1893 – March 31, 1957) was an American baseball player and manager. He holds the dubious distinction as having played for, and managed, two of the worst teams in the history of Major League Baseball.\n\nA catcher who spent most of his 19-year (1910–1928) playing career in the minor leagues, he threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and . Meyer broke into the majors with the 1913 Chicago White Sox, but played only one game. Three years later, when he returned to the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1916, he appeared in 50 games for a squad that won only 36 games and lost 117. The following year, he played in 62 games for an A's club that improved but still posted a 55–98 mark.\n\nThen, a generation-and-a-half later, Meyer managed the 1952 Pittsburgh Pirates to the third-worst record in modern National League history, the Bucs winning only 42 of 154 games.\n\nMeyer was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to William and Carrie Meyer. His father, born in the Grand Duchy of Baden in Germany, had emigrated to the United States at age 16 and operated a brewery in Knoxville. Meyer started playing baseball in grade school when his father bought him a catcher's mitt to catch his older brother. His hero was catcher Johnny Kling. He was a good student until high school, when baseball became such a primary focus that it even resulted in a school suspension. His father also owned a brewery in Smithton, Pennsylvania, for a time and the younger Meyer worked there during vacation. During his sophomore year of high school, Meyer was offered $75 per month to catch for a Lakeland, Florida, team, but he was expected to inherit the brewery so his father resisted the idea. He went regardless, and played so well that a Sanford, Florida, team offered him $175 per month to play for them. He caught for other Florida teams and finally hit a championship-winning home run for Gainesville, Florida. When he returned to Tennessee with $250, his father never protested against baseball again. \n\nIn 1915, Meyer played so well for a Davenport, Iowa, team that Connie Mack signed him to back up catcher Wally Schang for his major league Philadelphia Athletics. He recalled that Mack had him catch for unpredictable young pitchers in order to save Schang. He played 50 games for the A's that year--and was thus on hand for a season in which the A's finished with the worst winning percentage in major league history. He played 62 games for the A's in 1917. As it turned out, this would be Meyer's last season in the majors as an active player. He collected 71 hits, with seven doubles, three triples and one home run, batted .236, and was credited with 21 runs batted in. \n\nAfter the season, Meyer was sold to the Louisville Colonels in the American Association. He would stay in Louisville for 11 years, and was a major contributor to the Colonels' American Association pennants in 1921 and 1925 under Joe McCarthy.\n\nWhen McCarthy was called up to manage the Chicago Cubs for the season, Meyer was named to succeed him at the Colonels' helm. In his first season, Louisville won a second consecutive pennant with a team that included future Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman Billy Herman (whom Meyer would replace as skipper of the Pirates over 20 years later). But when the Colonels promptly slumped to consecutive 100-loss seasons in 1927 and 1928, he was fired. At the same time, he was released as a player.\n\nAfter spending three years (1929–1931) as a coach for the Minneapolis Millers, an American Association rival of the Colonels, Meyer became manager of the 1932 Springfield Rifles of the Eastern League, an affiliate of the New York Yankees, where McCarthy was in his second season as manager. Meyer had the Rifles in first place on July 17 when the league folded due to Depression-related financial troubles. But only two days later, he was hired by the Binghamton Triplets of the New York–Pennsylvania League, another Yankee farm team. Meyer stayed in Binghamton for 3 years, winning the pennant in 1933 and half the pennant in 1934 and 1935, and impressing George Weiss, head of the parent club's growing farm system. In 1936, Meyer moved up to the top-level Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, who then had a working agreement with the Bronx Bombers. He produced one playoff team in two seasons at Oakland and was named to manage another top-level Yankee farm outlet, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, in 1938. \n\nFor the next ten years, Meyer alternated as the manager of the Blues (1938–1941; 1946–1947) and the Yankees' other elite farm club, the Newark Bears of the International League. During that time, he won four pennants and finished second four times. His 1939 Blues, who finished 107–47 and won the Junior World Series for the second year in a row, were named the 12th best team in history by Minor League Baseball. Meyer was named Minor League Manager of the Year by \"The Sporting News.\" Overall, as a manager in the minors, Meyer won eight pennants, narrowly missed a ninth, and finished in the second division only twice. On July 6, 1944, Meyer and Newark were in last place, 30 games behind Bucky Harris and his Buffalo Bisons, and had lost to Buffalo seven consecutive times. Newark rebounded by winning 30 of 34 games while Buffalo dropped into the second division, and missed winning the pennant by a fraction of a percent. In 19 seasons as a minor league skipper, Meyer's clubs won 1,605 and lost 1,325 (.548).\n\nMeyer was known for scrappiness. With Newark, one of his players, Nick Rhabe, threatened the general manager, \"If you don't get me more dough, you'll be sorry.\" Rhabe carried through on the threat by running the bases poorly in a game. Meyer responded by knocking Rhabe down the dugout steps and kicking him off the team. In general, he was a disciplinarian who rarely screamed at players, similar to the style of Joe McCarthy.\n\nMeyer was an avid singer and a fan of George M. Cohan. While in New York, Joe McCarthy introduced Meyer to Cohan. Meyer impressed him by singing songs that Cohan himself had not remembered writing.\n\nDuring his minor league managerial career, Meyer was considered for major league jobs several times. He was a candidate to be manager for the 1938 Cleveland Indians, but lost out to Ossie Vitt. Later, he was derailed by clubs' preference of the time for former players whose major league résumés were stronger than Meyer's. When the Cubs fired Gabby Hartnett after the 1940 campaign Meyer was considered, but Jimmie Wilson got the job after helping the Cincinnati Reds win the 1940 World Series. In 1945, Frank E. McKinney, owner of the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, approached Meyer at the Little World Series in Louisville on behalf of the Indians' parent team, the Boston Braves, about their managerial opening, but the Braves ultimately chose Billy Southworth. The parent Yankees, meanwhile, had only one skipper from 1931 through 1945: McCarthy, who won eight American League pennants, seven World Series titles, and 1,438 regular-season games (an average of 96 a season) during that span.\n\nAfter a tumultuous 1946 season, which saw McCarthy quit as the Bombers' skipper in May, Yankees' president and co-owner Larry MacPhail offered the club's 1947 managerial job to Meyer. But Meyer had been seriously ill that same year; he had collapsed during a June game from heat prostration, and then was hospitalized for several weeks after suffering a mild heart attack. The hot-tempered, hard-drinking MacPhail also had a reputation for clashing with his managers. Meyer declined MacPhail's offer and instead returned to Kansas City, leading the 1947 Blues to a first-place finish. Meanwhile, the Yankees rebounded to win the 1947 pennant under Bucky Harris. In contrast, the Pirates had finished their second consecutive seventh-place season in the eight-team National League. In another turn of events, McKinney—who had contacted Meyer about interviewing with the Braves after the 1945 season—had become the Pirates' majority owner in August 1946 and hired former Yankee farm system official Roy Hamey as the Bucs' general manager. Hamey had worked with Meyer at Binghamton and Kansas City.\n\nMcKinney, Hamey and the Pirates—facing their own managerial vacancy after Herman's September 1947 resignation—then hired Meyer as Pittsburgh's pilot for 1948. McCarthy had followed Meyer's work with future Yankees stars in Oakland, Kansas City and Newark closely, and was impressed enough to say Meyer had been the best manager in the minor leagues at the time. He went as far as to predict that Meyer would be one of the best in the majors as well. In 1948, in his first season, Pittsburgh rose from seventh place to fourth in the standings—and just 8 games out of first. The 21-game improvement to 83–71 earned Meyer \"The Sporting News\" Major League Manager of the Year.\n\nDespite the home run heroics of Ralph Kiner, the Pirates dropped to sixth place in . Reportedly, Meyer lost the team when he suggested to reporters that a player had run into a pitchout on his own when he'd actually given the player a hit and run sign. By 1950 they were back in the cellar. In December 1950, the Pirate ownership replaced Hamey with Branch Rickey, whose solution was to purge the team of high-salaried veterans and bring up young players from the farm system—the same tactic he'd used to rebuild the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers. However, it backfired disastrously in Pittsburgh, and Meyer was saddled with what amounted to a minor-league team at the major-league level. The Pirates managed to improve to seventh in 1951, but lost 112 games in 1952—the second-worst record in franchise history, and the third-worst in modern (post-1900) National League history. Meyer resigned at the end of that campaign.\n\nDespite a managing record of 317–452 (.412) over five seasons, all with Pittsburgh, and his pedestrian big league playing career, Meyer was given two significant honors, a measure of how widely respected he was. He maintained close ties with his native city of Knoxville, and married a classmate from grade school, Madelon Warters, in 1932. For years Knoxville's baseball park was named Bill Meyer Stadium in his honor. In 1954, the Pirates retired Meyer's uniform number (1).\n\nMeyer appears in the Norman Rockwell painting \"Bottom of the Sixth\".\n\nAfter his managing days, Meyer worked as scout and troubleshooter for the Pirates until he suffered a stroke in 1955. Meyer died two years later, in Knoxville, of heart and kidney ailments at age 64.\n\n"}

The spore-bearing sporangiophores of \"Phycomyces\" are very sensitive to different environmental signals including light, gravity, wind, chemicals and adjacent objects. They exhibit phototropic growth: most \"Phycomyces\" research has focused on sporangiophore photobiology, such as phototropism and photomecism ('light growth response'). Metabolic, developmental, and photoresponse mutants have been isolated, some of which have been genetically mapped. At least ten different genes (named \"madA\" through to \"madJ\") are required for phototropism. The \"madA\" gene encodes a protein related to the White Collar 1 class of photoreceptors that are present in other fungi, while \"madB\" encodes a protein related to the White Collar 2 protein that physically bind to White collar 1 to participate in the responses to light.\n\n\"Phycomyces\" also exhibits an avoidance response, in which the growing sporangiophore avoids solid objects in its path, bending away from them without touching them, and then continuing to grow upward again. This is believed to result from an unidentified \"avoidance gas\" that is emitted by the growing zone of the sporangiophore. This gas would concentrate in the airspace between the \"Phycomyces\" and the object. This higher concentration would be detected by the side of the sporangiophore's growing zone, which would grow faster, causing the sporangiophore to bend away.\n\n\"Phycomyces blakesleeanus\" became the primary organism of research of the Nobel laureate Max Delbrück starting in the 1950s, when Delbrück decided to switch from research on bacteriophage and bacteria to \"P. blakesleeanus\".\n\nA genetic linkage map was developed for \"P.blakesleeanus\". This genetic map was constructed from 121 progeny of a cross between two wild type isolates and involved 134 markers. The markers were mostly PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Zygospores are the sexual structures of \"P. blakesleeanus\" in which the diploid zygote is formed and meiosis is presumed to take place. The data from this cross provided supporting evidence for meiosis during zygospore development.\n\n"}

In each episode, they were required to perform certain tasks, ranging from dog grooming, a fashion show, and organizing a charity event, while learning etiquette and manners. As they competed, Hilton guided them through a variety of challenges that cover subjects ranging from art and culture to beauty and fashion. Hilton met with the losing team at the end of each episode and eliminated one contestant with the catchphrase, \"\"You're not on the list.\"\"\n\nThe show was originally entitled \"The Good Life\", to tie it in to Paris Hilton's reality show \"The Simple Life\". The show was not renewed for a second season.\n\n\nYvette and Latricia have a conflict from the start. Yvette is bossy and tries to take over her team, this annoys her team as does her propensity to wear very short skirts.

Portrayed by veteran actress Barbara Knox, the character first appeared on-screen as Rita Littlewood for one episode on 2 December 1964, returning full-time to the series on 31 January 1972. Rita is the show’s second longest-serving character behind Ken Barlow (William Roache) who has been in the show since the very first episode.\n\nStan Ogden (Bernard Youens) is taken with a young woman in The Rovers Return Inn and buys her a drink, only for Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) to step in when he recognises her – Rita Littlewood, a belly dancer who's appearing at the Viaduct Sporting Club. She can't find digs for the week and persuades a reluctant Dennis to let her sleep in his mother Elsie's (Pat Phoenix) bed while she's away. Dennis worries what people will say about Rita staying with him. Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) calls on Dennis about panto rehearsals and is shocked to see Rita in her nightie. The next morning, Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) wonders why Dennis is making up a breakfast tray. Dennis tells Rita of his disillusionment with showbusiness. Charlie Moffitt (Gordon Rollings) slips on the joists in the loft and puts his foot through the ceiling of Elsie's room. He apologises to the figure in the bed and realises it isn't Elsie. Dennis pays for the hole to be repaired when Charlie blackmails him over Rita in the bed. Elsie returns to the house, sees the hole and hears about Rita. It would be over seven years until Rita reappears.\n\nIn January 1972, Rita returns to the Street as Rita Bates, living with Harry Bates (William Simons) as his common-law wife and his twelve-year-old son Terry (John Barrett). Initially attracted to Ken Barlow (William Roache), Rita later starts an on-off relationship with Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson). Len arrives at Harry's house to return a scarf that Rita left in his van. They flirt. Len tells Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield) and Ray Langton (Neville Buswell) to stay out of the house that evening as he’s entertaining a lady but to tidy up before they go. Ray delays going until Rita arrives so he can see who the woman is. Rita tells Len that her husband is away often working on building motorways. She obviously isn't happy in her marriage. Len tells her how much he likes her but Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) interrupts them. Rita is surprised to find out that Len is a councillor.\n\nRita entertains Len after getting Terry out of the way. Alf tells Betty Turpin (Betty Driver) that Rita's house is due for demolition and Len is on the housing committee, hence the reason he thinks she's showing an interest in him. Rita tells Len she has to vacate by the end of the week. Len agrees to help her as she's on the housing list. Rita introduces Len to her husband Harry, convinced Len will get them a house. Len arranges an appointment with them and the housing committee. Rita and Harry are offered a flat but need a marriage certificate and they reveal to Len that they lied about being married, and Harry has a wife. Len refuses to pull strings for them and is annoyed at being lied to. Harry kicks Rita out and she dumps herself on Len. Rita refuses to return to Harry but Len refuses to have her at No.9. When Elsie refuses, Maggie Clegg (Irene Sutcliffe) takes Rita in. Maggie tells Rita she can stay as long as she has to but not a minute longer. Harry arrives back at the site. Len tells him that he's only interested in Rita's welfare. Terry fails to turn up at school and Ken lectures Rita about Terry's welfare. She tells him that she is not his mother and that she and Harry are not married. Rita tells Len she doesn't want to go back to Harry – she wants him. Elsie tells Len that Rita is not his type. Two months later, Len gets tickets from Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) for the opening of the new Victoria Street Working Men's Club and invites Elsie and Alan Howard (Alan Browning). Len is shocked when Rita is introduced singing on stage, though Elsie thinks he knew all along that she'd be there. After her set, Len helps her when she is bothered by a drunk man. Len brings Rita to his table. Elsie is cold with her. Rita says she hasn't been with Harry Bates and his family for two months. Len wants to get to know Rita again. She agrees. From June 1972, the character is once again credited as Rita Littlewood.\n\nRita turns up at The Rovers to see Len and tells him about Alec's offer. Rita auditions for Alec. Rita cooks for the lads at No.9. Ray and Jerry don't like her. Jerry doesn't like the idea of having Rita around. Rita gets a regular spot from Alec. Jerry tells Ray he thinks Rita is a gold-digger. Rather than be taken out for the night by Len, she makes a meat and potato pie for the lads and wins Jerry over. Len takes her home and next morning Ray and Jerry discover he hasn't come back but has spent the night with her. Len brings Rita to the opening of a new betting shop. Benny Lewis (Jeremy Young), the owner, talks Rita into an afternoon job as a hostess. Len thinks he's got designs on her. Rita refuses to clean for Benny. Benny asks Rita to join the staff permanently. Rita isn't sure and asks Len who tells her it's her decision. Rita still can't decide whether to take the job with Benny. Len books a meal out for the two of them. Benny also asks Rita to come round to his flat that night but she turns him down. Len tells Rita he can't take her out after all. Benny entertains Rita in his new luxury flat above the betting shop though few of the remote control things work properly. Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) finds them there together. Rita tells Benny she will work for him. Hilda gleefully gossips to Len that Rita is with Benny. Rita stands Benny up to go out with Len. Rita skives off work to be with Benny. Rita passes on an invite to Len for drinks at Benny's flat.\n\nBenny tries to get Rita to stay for a few drinks but she refuses as she has a date with Len. Rita and Len join Elsie and Alan for a drink in The Rovers before they go out and the ice begins to thaw between Elsie and Rita. Jerry advises Benny to tell Rita he's serious about her as Len doesn't want anything permanent. Benny questions Rita about Len's treatment of her. Rita tells Len that Benny is always asking questions about him as he's interested in her. Benny asks Len how serious he is about Rita. He tells him he isn't. Benny rings Rita and passes on what Len just said. She's hurt. Len tells Rita to choose between him and Benny. Benny asks Rita to marry him and she accepts him. Jerry tells Len that Rita isn't steady enough for him. Benny presents Rita with an expensive engagement ring. Jerry tells Benny that he was wrong and that Len has real feelings for Rita. Benny asks to see Len and tells him that he's not certain Rita wants to marry him and that she and Len are meant for each other. He wants Len to confess his feelings to Rita. Len tells Rita that Benny is backing out and leaving the field open for him. He confesses he needs her and Rita goes off with him, leaving a disappointed Benny behind. Lucille spreads the word that Rita's engagement to Benny is over. Len insists that Rita give Benny his ring back. The residents get the wrong idea and think that Len is marrying Rita. Rita tells Len that she tried to give the ring back to Benny but he told her to keep it.\n\nRita tells Len that her landlady Lena Norris has told her that she can't have men visitors after 9 pm. Jerry warns Len that Rita has given up a lot for him and hasn't gotten much back. Len gets rid of Jerry to entertain Rita at No.9. Jerry interrupts Len and Rita just as they get amorous on the sofa. Having got rid of Jerry, Len and Rita start cuddling on the sofa. Ray interrupts them to borrow money off Len to take Mandy Taylor (Sarah Twist) out. Jerry gatecrashes Len and Rita's night again to collect his pen and notepad. He is soon followed by Ray, who abandoned his date as he found Mandy too hard to keep up with. Len pays him to go to the Rovers. Len sets up a rota so he can have time alone with Rita at No.9. Ray and Jerry are miffed that they each get one evening a week while Len gets two. Benny realises nearly £5,000 has been stolen. In his time of need, he calls on Rita before informing the police.\n\nDet Insp Patterson (Tony Steedman) investigates the burglary and interviews Rita and Benny about the routine of banking the money and who had the keys to the flat. Benny tells Ray and Len that Patterson thinks the keys they and Rita had were used in the robbery. Benny sacks Len. Rita takes him to task for it. Rita tells Len he won't have time to run the yard and be a councillor. She makes him buy Ray and Jerry a drink. Rita tells a worried Elsie about the night club deal. Benny feels life is looking up with the new business venture. He gets Rita to support him in a meeting to discuss terms with Jimmy Frazer (John Barrie) and Alan. Jimmy, Alan, and Elsie join Rita and Benny. Jimmy and Benny agree to be equal partners in the new club venture with Alan looking after Jimmy's interests in his absence. Rita decides to take the job of hostess at the Club, keeping on the Betting Shop as well. Mayor Harold Chapman (Frank Crompton) tells Len he's in for a chance of being the next Mayor of Weatherfield and tells him to look out for a suitable Mayoress, insinuating that Rita doesn't cut the mustard.\n\nLen asks Benny to drop Rita from The Capricorn. He refuses. Alan, Benny, and Rita hold auditions for dolly birds, hostesses and strippers at Benny's flat as the decorators are still at the club. Len asks Rita to drop the idea of being hostess. She wonders why he's changed his mind. Billy Walker (Ken Farrington) and Rita embarrass Len in front of Mayor Alderman Chapman at the opening of The Capricorn. Rita gets into a fight with a drunken woman and ends up on Chapman's lap, all to the delight of Alf and Alderman Rogers. Alf tells Rita that Len is up for Mayor of Weatherfield. Rita rows with Len in the Rovers when he accuses her of being too common. She pours a drink over him and walks out. Len pushes for Alan to fix his van and tells Alf he and Rita have split up. Rita notices how much Alan is drinking at the club. Rita worries that Alan is drinking too much. Elsie becomes suspicious of Alan's involvement with Rita. Rita carries Alan home in the early hours. She takes his keys and gives them to Billy in the morning. Elsie gives the keys back to Alan, viciously, wondering what he was doing with Rita. Alan tries to make Elsie see there's nothing between him and Rita. Alan refuses to give Hilda a sub as Rita isn't happy with her work. Hilda insinuates that Alan is seeing Rita and is sacked by Alan. Hilda tells Elsie she was sacked because she knew too much about Alan and Rita. Elsie decides to ask Rita what's going on. Rita tells Elsie there's nothing between Alan and her – it's the booze she's got to worry about. On Christmas Day, 1972, the residents gather in the select of the Rovers for the 1940s show as Rita plays Marlene Dietrich.\n\nLen is appointed Deputy Mayor. Rita avoids Len. He gives her an invitation via Jerry for a private drink. Jerry tries to speak to Rita about Len but Hilda interrupts. Len worries that Rita will think he's only interested in her now that he knows he won't be Mayor. Elsie speaks to Rita on his behalf but she's afraid that she'll be thrown to one side again as Len thinks she's not good enough, even though she needs him and knows he needs her. Elsie pushes Len to keep on pursuing Rita. Ray thinks Len is better off without Rita. Rita agrees to go to the pictures with Ray, annoying Len when Elsie tells him. Ena Sharples (Violet Carson) asks Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Rita and Norma Ford (Diana Davies) how Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant) has been behaving while she's been away. A worried Ray asks Rita to explain to Len that there's nothing between them but she refuses. Rita allows Len to buy her a drink. Rita introduces Len to her \"manager\" Johnny Mann (Charles Pemberton).\n\nRita takes a job singing in a nightclub, and when Len Fairclough purchases a failing newsagents, he installs Rita as manageress of \"The Kabin\", a corner shop which also serves light food, with Mavis Riley as her assistant. She becomes Rita Fairclough when she and Len marry in April 1977. The marriage runs into trouble in early 1980, when sick of being taken for granted and living in what she describes as squalor, Rita leaves Len and thanks to Ralph Lancaster's help, attempts to regain her cabaret career. After a physical altercation with Len, she flees to Blackpool, where Len tracks her down after several months and she agrees to return to Coronation Street, but only if Len renovates their home and changes his ways. In the summer of 1981, Rita and Len are rejected for being adoptive parents due to their age, (Rita told the agency she is aged 40, despite actress Knox being 48 at the time), but begin fostering children, enjoying their first foster son, John, despite the challenges. In March 1982, they take in foster daughter Sharon Gaskell (Tracie Bennett), who becomes part of their family. After Len builds a new home on the vacant lot of No. 7, the Faircloughs and Sharon move into the new home, but Sharon eventually moves away. Len is killed in a car accident in December 1983 and Rita is devastated to learn he had been having an affair. Sharon returns to comfort Rita, but when she attempts to break up Gail & Brian Tilsley's marriage, Rita throws Sharon out and she is not seen again until 1999. In January 1986, Rita takes in another foster daughter, Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), and meets her estranged father Alan (Mark Eden). She begins a relationship with him, unaware he is also seeing Gloria Todd (Sue Jenkins), a barmaid at The Rovers. When Rita discovers his infidelity, she insists he choose and although Alan chooses Gloria, Gloria doesn't feel the same and ends their affair. Rita allows Alan to move in to her home and he proposes marriage several times, even going as far as to arrange their wedding as a surprise to Rita, but she refuses to participate when she arrives at the registry office thinking she's a guest at another wedding. Alan is also a conman and after using Rita's capital to fund his own business enterprises, he poses as Len to the bank and re-mortgages Rita's house to start a security business when she refuses any more cash. He hires Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) as a receptionist and tries to rape her. Rita learns about the attack and Alan's fraudulent activities and reports him to the building society. In March 1989, in retaliation, he tries to suffocate her but fails and is found not guilty of attempted murder. He starts stalking Rita, who has a breakdown and escapes to Blackpool, but in December 1989 Alan tracks her down and tries to make her return to Weatherfield, but he is run down by a tram and killed in the attempt.\n\nIn 1992, she becomes Rita Sullivan when she marries Ted Sullivan (William Russell). The marriage only lasts three months, as he dies from a brain tumour. When Rita collapses in her flat in July 1998 from carbon monoxide poisoning, she is saved by Alec. Realising how close he came to losing his best friend, Alec proposes to Rita. She initially turns him down, but later changes her mind and accepts. Their relationship ends several months later when they realise they cannot trust one another. Rita takes in Stacey, a local woman who tried to con Fred Elliott (John Savident) by pretending to be a Thai bride named Orchid. She had previously conned a man named Stuart (Duncan Preston), who locked her in his flat for days at a time and inflicted physical violence on her. Stuart traces her to Rita's home and breaks in, destroying her property. He threatens Rita, and though he is arrested, Rita decides to move house. Rita later moves in with her old friend Doreen Fenwick (Barbara Young), and although they initially get along well, Doreen outstays her welcome. Rita is proposed to by her friend and co-worker Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), she turns him down.\n\nIn December 2010, Rita is trapped in the wreckage from the 50th anniversary tram crash when the tram smashes into the side of The Kabin. Everyone thought she had gone out for dinner with an old friend, therefore nobody knew she was in the wreckage until Nick Tilsey (Ben Price) informs Norris, Emily and Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) that he saw Rita before the tram crash and that she said to him that her friend cancelled on her, thus worrying Norris, Mary, and Emily. They inform the fire crew and Rita is found. Rita survives with cuts and bruises. She is traumatised by this, with proof taking place when The Rovers burns down in 2013, Rita is flustered at the thought of the tram crash.\n\nRita invites Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) to live with her when she is made homeless. Rita is shocked when she bumps into her old friend Dennis. As he has since fallen on hard times and is living as a homeless person, he is highly embarrassed when Rita recognises him, and he runs off. She later approaches Dennis Tanner at the soup kitchen and takes him to the Rovers to meet old friends Ken and Emily. Rita develops feelings for Dennis and tells Tina. Dennis feels guilty about living off Rita, and she supports him in his attempts to find a job but becomes depressed when he gets a job in Birmingham. Rita tells Tina that she loves Dennis and Tina reveals that he feels the same about her. When Rita returns home, she finds Dennis waiting for her. They declare their love for each other and Dennis proposes. On her wedding day in June 2012, Rita is kidnapped by loan shark, Rick Neelan (Greg Wood). He threatens to throw her into the canal if Tina does not give him a bag of drugs, which she had seized earlier in the day. Tina hands over the bag and the police arrive to arrest Rick. Rita is taken to the registry office and she marries Dennis. Rita is not very happy when Dennis decides he wants to be in the music industry again, so he contacts his old friend Ritchie de Vries (Robin Askwith). She feels insecure when Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) also decides to tag along with the whole idea, and becomes very close with Dennis, and the pair begin flirting. Rita begins a rivalry with Gloria, and when Dennis tries to look young again, Rita isn't very pleased. When they are in The Rovers, Dennis calls Rita \"old\", telling her that Gloria is ten years younger than her. Rita subsequently throws Dennis out of their house, so he sleeps at Gloria's house on the sofa. The next day, Rita has finally forgiven Dennis for his horrible insult, but when they are in the Bistro having a Valentine's Day meal, Gloria can't help but intervene and tells Rita that Dennis slept at her house the night before. Rita is furious and throws Dennis out again. Just as it seems that Rita and Dennis will live happily ever after, when Gloria announces she is leaving, Dennis decides to leave with Gloria at the last minute. He waves goodbye to Rita from Gloria's car as they drive out of the street and laughs. Rita looks hurt and embarrassed in front of her friends. Dennis and Gloria don't last long and he returns to the streets when she finishes with him, this results in him having a trip to hospital which Rita finds out about. On visiting Dennis in hospital, Rita tells him that she cannot forgive him for what he has done but offers him her sofa until he can sort himself out. Sometime after living together, Dennis begs Rita to take him back, but she declines, advising him that their marriage is over for good and the sooner he goes the better. In late 2016 Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) comes to live with Rita but clashes with Jenny who Rita recently came back into contact with.\n\nIn 2017, Rita starts becoming forgetful, starting when she forgets she bought Gemma a mug. She later accuses Gemma of stealing money that she lent to Gina Seddon (Connie Hyde), which results in Gemma and Rita falling out. They later make up but Rita's forgetfulness starts to get more frequent. She lays a place at the table for Len. Gemma confides in Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan). When Rita writes a number of cheques for Jenny and her fiancé, Johnny Connor, (Richard Hawley)'s wedding, Gemma tries to prove to her that there's something wrong with her. Rita refuses to believe Gemma, before she collapses. She is taken to hospital, where a specialist diagnoses her with a brain tumour. She later has the tumour removed. Colin Callen (Jim Moir) tells Rita he wants to buy the Kabin. Rita and Gemma later celebrate with their friends when they find out that Rita's tumour was benign.\n\nPrior to 2006, Knox was reportedly the highest-paid actress with the show, until Anne Kirkbride began to earn more. Knox's salary is £260,000 a year which producers pay to keep her in a secure future with the series.\n\nIn January 2009, it was speculated that Knox and other veteran actors were going to be axed from the show in a bid to save money but this was later denied by a \"Coronation Street\" spokesperson. Knox was temporarily written out of the series in August 2009 for health reasons. She returned to the show on 15 March 2010.\n\nIn April 2010 a spokesperson for \"Coronation Street\" announced that Knox has a job for life on the show and that she will continue to play her character Rita for as long as she wants to be there.\n\nThe producers of the show decided to pair Rita with Mavis Riley portrayed by Thelma Barlow by giving Mavis a job in Rita's corner shop; the characters' relationship has been described as a chalk and cheese comedy partnership. Christine Geraghty has cited Rita and Mavis' friendship as an example of a soap opera portraying an important, stable, intimate female relationship: \"Rita is Mavis's boss, but she is also one of her closest friends\".\n\nIn September 2009, Knox took a break from the show due to ill health and returned on 15 March 2010. Her character was said to be on a world cruise with friend Doreen Fenwick, after selling her share of \"The Kabin\" to Norris Cole.\n\nIn May 2011, a \"Daily Mirror\" reporter announced that Rita and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) would become love rivals, following Dennis Tanner's (Philip Lowrie) return. Lowrie hinted at a possible relationship between Dennis and Rita, saying \"I asked Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, how many husbands has she had? She said three, so there might be a fourth, you never know!\" Rita and Dennis begin a relationship and series producer Phil Collinson stated \"Rita genuinely loves Dennis very much. Their storyline harks back to 1964, when he looked after her and took her in. Now he's grown to love her because she's been able to look after him. I like that we can tell a love story of people in their 70s, and it's a relationship that we're really committed to. I'd love for Rita to have a wedding, so watch this space! And if we did have one, she'd be Mrs Tanner – how great is that?\" Collinson later revealed Rita and Dennis would get married and their wedding would coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nIn August 2017, the character was involved in a storyline which saw her diagnosed with a brain tumour. Many of the show's fans were devastated by the idea that such a beloved and iconic character might be killed off. The storyline received a lot of media attention and criticism from the viewers, as it began shortly after the death of Ashley Thomas, a character from fellow ITV programme \"Emmerdale\", who had a seemingly similar diagnosis. Within days of the storyline being introduced a \"Save Rita\" campaign was set up online and attracted over 500 signatures. A spokesperson for \"Coronation Street\" later denied that the character was going to die, and confirmed that Knox remains very much part of the show.\n\nIn December 2019, it was reported by \"The Sun\" that Rita would feature in a big storyline over Christmas. Producer Ian Macleod relished the chance to give Barbara Knox the spotlight after all of these decades in Weatherfield. \"It's a really good story actually and Barbara Knox, as is always the case, if you give her something big to do she nails it,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that with any hint of surprise in my voice, she's been doing it for decades. She's so good at it and it's a great story. She's embraced it with the gusto you'd expect from someone who's been doing it for so long.\"\n\nKnox won the 1989 TV Times Award for \"Best Actress\". At The British Soap Awards 2004, she was presented with a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" for her portrayal of Rita. The 2006 ceremony saw Knox and Malcolm Hebden, who plays Norris, win the award for \"Best On-Screen Partnership.\" Knox was nominated for \"Best Serial Drama Performance\" at the National Television Awards 2018, losing out to her \"Coronation Street\" co-star, Lucy Fallon, who portrays Bethany Platt. She is a fan favourite amongst the viewers (in 2010 she was voted the 5th best character of all time).\n"}

{"id": "2189027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2189027", "title": "Bangor Daily News", "text": "Bangor Daily News\n\nThe Bangor Daily News is an American newspaper covering a large portion of central and eastern Maine, published six days per week in Bangor, Maine.\n\nThe \"Bangor Daily News\" was founded on June 18, 1889; it merged with the \"Bangor Whig and Courier\" in 1900. Also known as \"the News\" or \"the BDN\", the paper is published by Bangor Publishing Company, a local family-owned company. \n\nIt has been owned by the Towle-Warren family for four generations; current publisher Richard J. Warren is the great-grandson of J. Norman Towle, who bought the paper in 1895. Since 2018, it has been the only independently owned daily newspaper in the state.\n\nThe \"Bangor Daily News\"s first issue was June 18, 1889; the main stockholder in the publishing company was Bangor shipping and logging businessman Thomas J. Stewart. Upon Stewart's death in 1890, his sons took control of the paper, which was originally a tabloid with \"some news, but also plenty of gossip, lurid stories and scandals.\" In 1895, J. Norman Towle purchased the newspaper. Ownership of the paper remained in the family, and Towle's great-grandson Richard J. Warren remains the publisher today. \n\nThe \"Bangor Daily News\" merged with the \"Bangor Whig & Courier\" in 1900, leaving two newspapers in the city: \"BDN\" and the \"Bangor Daily Commercial\" (which ceased publication in 1949). Towle's son-in-law Fred Jordan took control of the paper in 1929. Forty-six \"BDN\" staff members served in the U.S. forces during World War II, and the paper's managing editor John M. O’Connell was sent to Europe as a war correspondent. After Fred Jordan's death in 1947, his widow Lillis Towle Jordan became publisher. Richard K. Warren became publisher in 1955 and remained in that role until 1984, a time when the newspaper's circulation dramatically increased. It has only missed one day of delivery in its entire history. On New Year's Eve 1962, a massive blizzard dumped over three feet of snow on Bangor, with 20-foot snowdrifts that made it impossible for the delivery trucks to move.\n\nThe newspaper's peak came in the mid-1980s, when \"Bangor Daily News\" had 150 reporters and editors and 150 other employees. At the time, published seven regional editions of the newspaper throughout Maine, and in addition to its main office on Main Street in Bangor had news bureaus at Madawaska, Presque Isle, Houlton, Pittsfield, Calais, Machias, Rockland, Augusta and Ellsworth.\n\nIn 1982, a reporter for the \"Bangor Daily News\", Beurmond Banville, who ran a one-person news bureau for the paper in Madawaska, Maine, on the U.S.-Canada border, wrote about a pretrial hearing in a murder case in New Brunswick, Canada. After publishing an account of the restricted proceeding in \"BDN\", Banville was convicted in a Canadian court for violating a publication ban, and was fined $160; in 1983, the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick upheld the conviction, but gave Banville an absolute discharge, meaning that he does not have any Canadian criminal record. Banville and the newspaper considered the Canadian court's ruling to be a prior restraint on freedom of the press, but decided not to further appeal considering the cost. The ruling appears in a textbook on Canadian media law.\n\nRichard J. Warren succeeded his father as editor in 1984; five years later, the newspaper moved its printing plant from Bangor to a new printing plant in Hampden (which was closed in 2013 and sold in 2015). \n\nThe newspaper was an early adopter of a policy against running tobacco advertising. As of 1993, the \"Bangor Daily News\" was one of fewer than twenty American newspapers that declined to accept ads for tobacco products.\n\nThe newspaper launched its Web presence in 1997 at \"bangornews.com\", later moving to \"bangordailynews.com\" in the 2000s. From 1997 to 2001, \"BDN\" acted as an Internet service provider in addition to a newspaper, working with two local, small telecommunications companies to provide dial-up Internet access to a few thousand people in Maine.\n\n\"BDN\" adopted an aggressive \"digital-first\" publishing strategy, and became the most-read online news source in the state; in 2011, the \"Portland Press Herald\" outsold \"BDN\" in print copies by a few thousand papers on an average weekday, but \"BDN\"s website had more than 100,000 unique visitors than the \"Press Herald\"s website.\n\nIn 2008, the paper's editorial page director, Todd Benoit, was appointed \"BDN\"s director of new media; he later became \"BDN\"s president and chief operating officer. In 2014, Richard J. Warren became publisher of the newspaper. The company that owns and operates the newspaper, Bangor Publishing Co., expanded through acquisitions of \"Bangor Metro\" magazine (2014), Madawaska's \"St. John Valley Times\" (2015), and Fort Kent's \"Fiddlehead Focus\" (2016). The company also owns several weekly newspapers in Maine: the Presque Isle \"Star-Herald\", Caribou \"Aroostook Republican and News\", Dover-Foxcroft \"Piscataquis Observer\", \"Houlton Pioneer Times\", and Greater Bangor \"The Weekly\".\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, \"BDN\" established the partnerships \"The Maine Campus\" (the independent student newspaper at the University of Maine) and \"The Free Press\" (the student newspaper at the University of Southern Maine) through the \"BDN\" media partners program. The program involves a content-sharing agreement as well as training and Web hosting services provided by \"BDN\" to the student newspapers.\n\nIn 2011, \"BDN\" hired an additional reporter to cover Greater Portland and reassigned another reporter to cover the southern mid-coast of Maine. Editor-in-chief Mike Dowd also named editorial-page editor Susan Young as \"managing editor for investigative reporting and new initiatives\" and appointed Tom Groening as editorial-page editor.\n\nThe \"Bangor Daily News\" and \"The Quoddy Tides\" sought records under the Maine Freedom of Access Act of closed-door tribal councils of the Passamaquoddy Tribe relating to a proposed $500 million liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on tribal land at the Pleasant Point Reservation. A Maine court decided that the newspapers were not entitled to the records because the tribal officials' negotiations with the Oklahoma-based LNG developer were undertaken in the reservation's capacity as \"a profit-making business rather than municipal governance\" and were therefore not subjected to the Freedom of Access Act. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court unanimously affirmed the ruling in 2006. In 2013, \"Bangor Daily News\" reporters submitted a public records request to Maine's state government for public information that included the names and addresses of the holders of concealed-weapon permits. The request, made in furtherance of newsgathering, prompted a fierce uproar, and the newspaper dropped the request.\n\nIn 2018, \"Bangor Daily News\" became the state's only independently owned daily newspaper in the state, after MaineToday Media, owned by Reade Brower, acquired additional newspapers in Maine. MaineToday now owns the seven of Maine's eight daily newspapers: the \"Portland Press Herald\" and \"Maine Sunday Telegram\", the \"Times Record\" of Brunswick, the \"Journal Tribune\" of Biddeford, the \"Kennebec Journal\" in Augusta, the \"Morning Sentinel\" in Waterville, and the \"Coastal Journal\" in Bath. Although Brower's company does not own \"BDN\", it does provide printing services for \"BDN\".\n\nAs of 2020, about half of \"BDN\"s journalists were based in Bangor, with the other half spread across Maine.\n\nThe \"Bangor Daily News\"s editorial stance has traditionally leaned toward conservatism and the Republican Party, in contrast to the \"Portland Press Herald\", which was regarded as having a more liberal, pro-Democratic editorial stance. It historically endorsed Republican candidates for office, such as Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, but has also sometimes endorsed Democratic candidates. In the 1974 Maine gubernatorial election, the \"Bangor Daily News\" endorsed independent candidate James B. Longley: \"The newspaper had always endorsed Republicans, so backing an independent was stunning.\" The endorsement was a major boost to Longley's candidacy. The paper also backed independent candidate Herman \"Buddy\" Frankland and Republican Susan Collins. \n\n\"BDN\"s editorial board endorsed Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election, but endorsed Democrat John Kerry over Bush in the 2004 presidential election. In 2008, \"BDN\" endorsed Democrat Barack Obama for president, Republican Susan Collins for Senate, and Democrats Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree for Maine's congressional seats. The paper's editorial board also endorsed Obama for reelection in 2012 over Republican challenger Mitt Romney.\n\n"}

Subsequently, he settled down as a lawyer, at first in Dachau, later in Munich.\n\nAfter 1899, he worked for the magazine \"Simplicissimus\" and published humorous narrations, comedies, novels and stories. Thoma satirized Bavarian rural and small-town life. His serious peasant novels \"Andreas Vöst\" (1905), \"Der Wittiber\" (1911), and \"Der Ruepp\" (1922), as well as his humorous collections \"Assessor Karlchen\" (1900), \"Lausbubengeschichten\" (\"Scoundrel Stories\", 1904), and \"Tante Frieda\" (\"Aunt Frieda\", 1906), are characterized by authenticity of regional language and life. Thoma's dramas, including \"Die Medaille\" (\"The Medal\", 1901), \"Das Säuglingsheim\" (\"The Orphanage\", 1913), and especially \"Moral\" (1908), reflect elements of folk theater.\n\nIn 1907 he married 25-year-old Marietta di Rigardo, who was born in the Philippines. The marriage, however, did not last; Marietta was soon bored and by 1911 Thoma and Marietta were divorced. In the later years of his life, he wrote nationalistic propaganda agitating against left-wing politicians (e.g. for the newspaper \"Miesbacher Anzeiger\").\n\nDuring World War I he served as a paramedic. In July 1917 he joined the German Fatherland Party.\n\nHis best-known works are \"Der Münchner im Himmel\" (\"The Municher in Heaven\"), which was adapted into an animated short film released in 1962, the \"Lausbubengeschichten\" (\"Scoundrel Stories\") and \"Jozef Filsers Briefwexel\" (\"Jozef Filser's Correspondence\"). \"Lausbubengeschichten\" was made into a movie in 1964, also released in English under the title \"\".\n\n\n"}

It covers an area of 76.19 square kilometres which makes it the fourth-largest conurbation in the Rhein-Sieg district. It contains over 80 townships and boroughs, divided over the municipal districts of Stieldorf, Niederdollendorf, Oberdollendorf, Heisterbacherrott, Ittenbach, Oberpleis, Eudenbach, Thomasberg and Königswinter proper.\n\nThe Drachenfels, crowned by the ruins of a castle built in the early 12th century by the archbishop of Cologne, rises behind the town. From the summit, which can be accessed by the Drachenfels Railway, there is a view celebrated by Lord Byron in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\".\n\nA cave in the hill is said to have sheltered the dragon () which was slain by the hero Siegfried. The mountain is quarried, and from 1267 onward supplied stone (trachyte) for the building of Cologne Cathedral. The Schloss Drachenburg, built in 1883, is on the north side of the hill.\n\nThe Petersberg mountain also overlooks Königswinter. This was formerly the home of an Augustinian and, later, Cistercian monastery. Around 1195 the monks moved to the foot of the mountain and founded the Abbey of Heisterbach, which was destroyed in 1803. The ruins can still be seen.\n\nToday the peak of the Petersberg is occupied by the Hotel Petersberg, a grand hotel which serves as a guest house for the German Government. Many world leaders have stayed there, and conferences are regularly held. Like the Drachenfels, the Petersberg was once served by its own railway, the Petersberg Railway, but this closed in 1958 and the hotel is now reached by road or helicopter.\n\nKönigswinter has a Catholic (St Remigius) and a Protestant church, some small manufactures and a little shipping. It has a monument to the poet Wolfgang Müller.\n\nThe town is served by Königswinter and Niederdollendorf stations on the Rhine East Bank Railway between Cologne and Wiesbaden, as well as by several stops on line 66 of the Bonn Stadtbahn, which takes a different route through the town. The tourist-oriented Drachenfels Railway does not connect direct with either of these lines but instead relies on a steam-outline road train for connection to the town centre and stations.\n\nSeveral ferries cross the Rhine between Königswinter and the west bank.\n\nKönigswinter is twinned with:\n\n"}

He is the author of numerous books and articles on sports, specifically on their cultural impact, their relationship with race, and the issue of doping.\n\nHe is a European cultural and intellectual historian, who has interests in and the history of racial ideas. He has published nearly one hundred sports articles and books in American newspapers and magazines and in Der Spiegel. As he is fluent in Scandinavian languages as well as German, he was e.g. co-editor for the North American sport historians of their special issue on 'German sports history. He is a Fellow of the European committee for sports history.\n\nHis most recent book, \"Testosterone Dreams\", is a history of the use of hormone treatments for lifestyle and performance enhancement during the last century, in the context of an analysis of modern society's ever-increasing use of chemical enhancements in general and its effect on human self-image. It focuses in particular on the early commercial marketing of the hormone testosterone, which is considered representative of all the performance-enhancing drugs that followed it.\n\n\"Testosterone dreams are the fantasies of hormonal rejuvenation, sexual excitement, and supernormal human performance that have been inspired by testosterone since it was first synthesized in 1935.\"\n\n\"Within a generation, sports audiences around the world were enjoying record-breaking performances achieved by athletes whose \"productive power\" was boosted by testosterone-based anabolic steroids. The \"doping\" of athletes with androgens and other hormones can thus be understood as one of the human enhancements that will precipitate an unprecedented crisis of human identity during the twenty-first century.\"\n\n\"As more drugs are finding new and often unexpected uses, the distinction between illegitimate doping and socially acceptable forms of drug-assisted productivity is gradually disappearing. One consequence of this vanishing boundary is that the de facto legitimizing of a drug can also create an implicit or even explicit obligation to use it for purposes society or certain subcultures define as desirable.\"\n\n\"Such scenarios show how hard it can be to determine where therapy ends and performance enhancement begins. This uncertainty about the boundary between healing and enhancement changes our sense of what is \"normal\" and what is not. If I become fatigued while my drug-taking coworkers stay alert, their \"supernormal\" stamina may well recalibrate the very idea of normal functioning. Their greater productivity might eventually legitimize their doping habit and make it compulsory for everyone. In this work environment, it is the drug-free worker who is in a state of deficiency.\"\n\nIn 1997, Dr. Hoberman became a source of controversy with the release of his book \"Darwin's Athletes: How Sport Has Damaged Black America and Preserved the Myth of Race\", over its highly critical analysis of the relationships between sport and African American culture. Accusations of racism and ethnocentrism were leveled at him; however, actual excerpts from the book seemed to show his extreme opposition to racism, and in later materials (see \"How Not to Misread Darwin’s Athletes\") he acknowledged his unfortunate naïveté regarding how a white author would be perceived when writing on such a topic. Overall, the scholarly and critical reactions to the book were largely positive.\n\n\"[T]he presence of large numbers of black athletes in the major sports appears to have persuaded almost everyone that the process of integration has been a success. This sense of closure is an illusion that is rooted not in the fact of racial equality but in a combination of black apathy and white public relations efforts.\"\n\n\"The Jackie Robinson story has long served white America, and liberals in particular, as a deeply satisfying combination of entertainment and civic virtue that has simultaneously permitted disengagement from less tractable and more important interracial tasks, such as the pursuit of educational and military equality.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2189067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2189067", "title": "Donald McGavran", "text": "Donald McGavran\n\nDonald Anderson McGavran (December 15, 1897 – July 10, 1990) was a missiologist and founding Dean of the School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, and is known for his work related to evangelism and religious conversion.\n\nMcGavran identified differences of caste and economic social position as major barriers to the spread of Christianity. His work substantially changed the methods by which missionaries identify and prioritize groups of persons for missionary work and stimulated the Church Growth Movement. McGavran developed his church growth principles after rejecting the popular view that mission was ‘philanthropy, education, medicine, famine relief, evangelism, and world friendship’ and become convinced that good deeds – while necessary – ‘must never replace the essential task of mission, discipling the peoples of the earth’.\n\nMcGavran was born in Damoh, India, in 1897. Following his father and grandfather, McGavran became the third generation of missionaries in his family.\n\nHe received his early education in Central Provinces, India. After his family returned to the United States, he went to school in Tulsa, OK and Indianapolis, IN. He attended Butler University (B.A., 1920), Yale Divinity School (B.D., 1922), the former College of Mission, Indianapolis (M.A., 1923), and, following two terms in India, Columbia University (Ph.D., 1936).\n\nThrough the influence of John R. Mott and the Student Volunteer Movement, McGavran went to India as a missionary in 1923, working primarily as an educator under appointment with the United Christian Missionary Society of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In 1927 he became director of religious education for his mission, before returning to the United States to work on his Ph.D. at Columbia University. After his return to India, he was elected field secretary in 1932 and placed in charge of administering the denomination’s entire India mission.\nDuring his time in India, McGavran was deeply influenced by J. Waskom Pickett, once saying: \"I lit my candle at Pickett’s fire.\" In 1928 Pickett was asked by the National Christian Council of India, Burma, and Ceylon to make an extensive study of the phenomenon in India of \"Christian mass movements,\" that is, mass conversion of certain sectors of Indian society.\n\nMcGavran read Pickett’s book and recommended to his mission headquarters in Indianapolis that they employ the services of Pickett to study why similar mass movements to Christ were not happening in their ministry area of mid-India. As supervisor of eighty missionaries and various medical and educational institutions, McGavran had become concerned that after several decades of work his mission had only about thirty small churches, all of which were experiencing little growth. At the same time, he saw \"people movements\" in scattered areas of India where thousands of people in groups, rather than as individuals, were becoming Christians. McGavran assisted Pickett in the study and became the chief architect of the study in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn 1937 McGavran wrote a book called \"Founders of the India Church\" in which he turned the spotlight on humble Indians who began people movements. McGavran discovered that of the 145 areas where mission activity was taking place, 134 had grown only eleven percent between 1921 and 1931. The churches in those areas were not even conserving their own children in the faith. Yet, in the other eleven areas the church was growing by one hundred percent, one hundred fifty percent, and even two hundred percent a decade. He wondered why some churches were growing, while others, often just a few miles away, were not.\n\nDuring this same time period, McGavran was quietly changing his view of mission and theology. In the formative years of his childhood, mission was held to be carrying out the Great Commission, winning the world for Christ, and saving lost humanity. This was the view McGavran held when he returned to the United States for his higher education. While attending Yale Divinity School, McGavran was introduced to the teachings of the influential Christian professor H. Richard Niebuhr. According to McGavran, Niebuhr \"used to say that mission was everything the church does outside its four walls. It was philanthropy, education, medicine, famine relief, evangelism, and world friendship.\" McGavran espoused this view of mission when he went to the mission field in 1923. As he became involved in education, social work, and evangelism in India, he gradually reverted to his earlier position that mission was about making disciples of Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen McGavran's three-year term as mission secretary was up in 1936, he was not reelected. According to McGavran, in effect the mission said to him, “Since you are talking so much about evangelism and church growth, we are going to locate you in a district where you can practice what you preach”. McGavran accepted his new appointment and spent the next seventeen years trying to start a people movement among the Satnamis caste. About one thousand people were won to Christ, fifteen small village churches were planted, and the Gospels were translated into Chhattisgarhi.\n\nIn 1958, McGavran resigned from his mission work and proposed to a number of American seminaries the possibility of starting a department focused on the subject of church growth. It was not until 1961 when Institute of Church Growth was established at Northwest Christian College in Eugene, Oregon. Eventually in 1965, David Allan Hubbard invited McGavran to become the first dean of School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.\n\nBased on his lectures in Eugene and later at Fuller, McGavran published the book \"Understanding Church Growth\" (1970). In the work, McGavran articulated a key feature of his church growth theory, known as the \"homogenous unit principle.\" Drawing from his experiences in India of mass movements, the homogenous unit principle reasoned that individuals are more likely to convert to Christianity \"en masse\" when they share similar demographics.\n\n\n"}

As such, they are distinguished from the Sacraments of healing (Anointing of the sick and Sacrament of Penance) and from the Sacraments of Service (Marriage and Ordination).\n\nIn the Eastern Church all three sacraments are usually administered at the same time, even,in in the case of infants. In the Latin Church and other Western denominations, the rite of infant baptism was developed for use with babies. In these traditions the Eucharist and Confirmation are postponed until the child achieves the age of self-awareness. Adults are normally baptized after enrollment as a \"catechumen\", either formally, as in the Latin Rite, or more informally, as in some Eastern Catholic Churches. In his apostolic constitution \"Divinae consortium naturae\" on the sacrament of Confirmation, Pope Paul VI declared: \"The sharing in the divine nature given to men through the grace of Christ bears a certain likeness to the origin, development, and nourishing of natural life. The faithful are born anew by Baptism, strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation, and receive in the Eucharist the food of eternal life.\"\n\nAccording to Roman Catholic theology, the way the sacraments of initiation are celebrated is meant to bring a neophyte to experience and know, through visible sacramental signs and gestures, eternal life and grace Jesus has brought into this world. They are always accompanied by the Word of God. Particular focus is placed on the paschal mystery of Christ's death and resurrection. The privileged time of celebrating them is Easter, and by the 4th century it was accepted as the normal time of administering them, although it was also allowed on Pentecost.\n\n\n"}
