{"id": "2105390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105390", "title": "Mastoiditis", "text": "Mastoiditis\n\nMastoiditis is the result of an infection that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear. Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and mastoid air cell system inside the mastoid process. The mastoid process is the portion of the temporal bone of the skull that is behind the ear. The mastoid process contains open, air-containing spaces. Mastoiditis is usually caused by untreated acute otitis media (middle ear infection) and used to be a leading cause of child mortality. With the development of antibiotics, however, mastoiditis has become quite rare in developed countries where surgical treatment is now much less frequent and more conservative, unlike former times. Additionally, there is no evidence that the drop in antibiotic prescribing for otitis media has increased the incidence of mastoiditis, raising the possibility that the drop in reported cases is due to a confounding factor such as childhood immunizations against \"Haemophilus\" and \"Streptococcus\". Untreated, the infection can spread to surrounding structures, including the brain, causing serious complications. While the use of antibiotics has reduced the incidence of mastoiditis, the risk of masked mastoiditis, a subclinical infection without the typical findings of mastoiditis has increased with the inappropriate use of antibiotics and the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. \n\nSome common symptoms and signs of mastoiditis include pain, tenderness, and swelling in the mastoid region. There may be ear pain (otalgia), and the ear or mastoid region may be red (erythematous). Fever or headaches may also be present. Infants usually show nonspecific symptoms, including anorexia, diarrhea, or irritability. Drainage from the ear occurs in more serious cases, often manifest as brown discharge on the pillowcase upon waking.\n\nThe pathophysiology of mastoiditis is straightforward: bacteria spread from the middle ear to the mastoid air cells, where the inflammation causes damage to the bony structures. \"Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae,\" and \"Moraxella catarrhalis\" are the most common organisms recovered in acute mastoiditis. Organisms that are rarely found are \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" and other Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, and anaerobic bacteria. \"P. aeruginosa,\" Enterobacteriaceae,\" S. aureus\" and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and \"Peptostreptococcus\" spp. ) are the most common isolates in chronic mastoiditis. Rarely, \"Mycobacterium\" species can also cause the infection. Some mastoiditis is caused by cholesteatoma, which is a sac of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear that usually results from repeated middle-ear infections. If left untreated, the cholesteatoma can erode into the mastoid process, producing mastoiditis, as well as other complications.\n\nThe diagnosis of mastoiditis is clinical—based on the medical history and physical examination. Imaging studies provide additional information; The standard method of diagnosis is via MRI scan although a CT scan is a common alternative as it gives a clearer and more useful image to see how close the damage may have gotten to the brain and facial nerves. Planar (2-D) X-rays are not as useful. If there is drainage, it is often sent for culture, although this will often be negative if the patient has begun taking antibiotics. Exploratory surgery is often used as a last resort method of diagnosis to see the mastoid and surrounding areas.\n\nIf ear infections are treated in a reasonable amount of time, the antibiotics will usually cure the infection and prevent its spread. For this reason, mastoiditis is rare in developed countries. Most ear infections occur in infants as the eustachian tubes are not fully developed and don't drain readily.\n\nIn all developed countries with up-to-date modern healthcare the primary treatment for mastoiditis is administration of intravenous antibiotics. Initially, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given, such as ceftriaxone. As culture results become available, treatment can be switched to more specific antibiotics directed at the eradication of the recovered aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Long-term antibiotics may be necessary to completely eradicate the infection. If the condition does not quickly improve with antibiotics, surgical procedures may be performed (while continuing the medication). The most common procedure is a myringotomy, a small incision in the tympanic membrane (eardrum), or the insertion of a tympanostomy tube into the eardrum. These serve to drain the pus from the middle ear, helping to treat the infection. The tube is extruded spontaneously after a few weeks to months, and the incision heals naturally. If there are complications, or the mastoiditis does not respond to the above treatments, it may be necessary to perform a mastoidectomy: a procedure in which a portion of the bone is removed and the infection drained.\n\nWith prompt treatment, it is possible to cure mastoiditis. Seeking medical care early is important. However, it is difficult for antibiotics to penetrate to the interior of the mastoid process and so it may not be easy to cure the infection; it also may recur. Mastoiditis has many possible complications, all connected to the infection spreading to surrounding structures. Hearing loss is likely, or inflammation of the labyrinth of the inner ear (labyrinthitis) may occur, producing vertigo and an ear ringing may develop along with the hearing loss, making it more difficult to communicate. The infection may also spread to the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), causing facial-nerve palsy, producing weakness or paralysis of some muscles of facial expression, on the same side of the face. Other complications include Bezold's abscess, an abscess (a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue) behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck, or a subperiosteal abscess, between the periosteum and mastoid bone (resulting in the typical appearance of a protruding ear). Serious complications result if the infection spreads to the brain. These include meningitis (inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain), epidural abscess (abscess between the skull and outer membrane of the brain), dural venous thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the venous structures of the brain), or brain abscess.\n\nIn the United States and other developed countries, the incidence of mastoiditis is quite low, around 0.004%, although it is higher in developing countries. The condition most commonly affects children aged from two to thirteen months, when ear infections most commonly occur. Males and females are equally affected.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2105400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105400", "title": "The Blackwood Brothers", "text": "The Blackwood Brothers\n\nThe Blackwood Brothers are an American southern gospel quartet. Pioneers of the Christian music industry, they are 8-time Grammy Award winners in addition to winning 7 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards. They are also members of the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, Gospel Music Hall of Fame, the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Blackwood Brothers Quartet were formed in 1934 in the midst of the Great Depression when preacher Roy Blackwood (1900–71) moved his family back home to Choctaw County, Mississippi. His brothers, Doyle Blackwood (1911–74) and 15-year-old James Blackwood (1919–2002), already had some experience singing with Vardaman Ray and Gene Catledge. After adding Roy's 13-year-old son, R.W. Blackwood (1921–54), to sing baritone, the brothers began to travel and sing locally. By 1940, they were affiliated with the Stamps-Baxter Music Company to sell songbooks and were appearing on 50,000-watt radio station KMA (AM) in Shenandoah, Iowa. Doyle left in 1942 and was replaced by Don Smith. After Doyle left, The Quartet relocated to Memphis, Tennessee in 1950. The move proved to be successful for the group as they began to appear on television station WMCT in coming years. In 1952 they signed a major recording contract with RCA Victor. After the move to Memphis, Roy left and was replaced with Calvin Newton, who was replaced with Cat Freeman, and after Freeman left, Alden Toney was hired to sing tenor. In 1951, Alden Toney and Don Smith left and were replaced with Dan Huskey and Bill Lyles. In 1952, Dan Huskey left and was replaced by Bill Shaw. On June 14, 1954, the Blackwood Brothers lineup of Bill Shaw (tenor), James Blackwood (lead), R.W. Blackwood (baritone), Bill Lyles (bass), and Jackie Marshall (piano), won the Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts competition on national television with their rendition of \"Have You Talked To The Man Upstairs?\" The win propelled them into the national spotlight and beyond just the Southern United States.\n\nAfter winning on Talent Scouts, the group began flying to shows with their own private plane due to the demand of their performances. However, on June 30, 1954, the group was scheduled to perform with The Statesmen Quartet in Clanton, Alabama during a town festival. Prior to the start of their show; R.W. Blackwood, Bill Lyles, and Johnny Ogburn, a local friend of the Blackwood Brothers decided to take a quick ride on the plane around dusk. Tenor singer Bill Shaw recalled the event saying; \"It was about dusk, and they were going take off, and it was unlit, and the plane went out its usual way, but then seemed like it got caught in the upward position and could not pull out, and then just fell to the ground and killed everyone on board.\" Members of The Statesmen Quartet also witnessed it and provided aid to the survivors, taking them back to Memphis that night. After a funeral that was attended by thousands in Memphis, including a young Elvis Presley, the survivors, James Blackwood, Bill Shaw, and Jackie Marshall decided to press on. R.W.'s younger brother Cecil Blackwood (1934–2000) took over as baritone and former Sunshine Boys Quartet J. D. Sumner replaced Bill Lyles at the bass position. According to Ken Berryhill, their producer, it was at about this point in their career that they first crossed paths with the young Elvis Presley, with whom they became friends. In the following years, the group was the first to customize a bus to make travel spacious and comfortable for entertainers, thereby inventing the customized \"Tour Bus\", something which many years later, when already the most famous singer in the planet, Presley saw and went straight out and had one made for him.\n\nAfter the crash, The group went to work forming the Gospel Music Association and also was partially responsible for the creation of the National Quartet Convention. Sumner also contributed to the group as a songwriter, sometimes writing all the songs for a music album. The Blackwood Brothers were also setting new standards in the studio. Their RCA Victor recordings from this time period are now considered prized collectors' items. The lineup with Bill Shaw, James, Cecil, and J.D. Sumner (who for many years was unchallenged as the Guinness World Record holder for having the lowest human voice on record, and was only superseded after Guinness started accepting vocal fry as part of the vocal range) is considered the classic version of the Blackwood Brothers Quartet, with Jackie Marshall or Wally Varner on piano. A replica of the bus can be seen at the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee\nThe Blackwood Brothers formed a partnership with the Statesmen Quartet to tour as a team in the 1950s, and they were the dominant act on the southern gospel circuit during this time. This dominance lasted for about a decade until the rise of gospel television shows in the late 1960s began to give competing groups wider exposure. The \"Stateswood\" team also started independent record label Skylite Records. At one time, the Skyline roster included The Blackwood Brothers, J.D. Sumner and the Stamps Quartet, Jake Hess and the Imperials, the Speer Family, the Florida Boys, the Couriers Quartet, The Kingsmen Quartet, the Calvarymen Quartet, the Calvary Quartet, the Kingdom Heirs Quartet, the Statesmen Quartet, the Prophets Quartet, the Oak Ridge Boys, the Jordanaires, the Southerners Quartet, and the Rebels Quartet.\n\nIn 1966, the Blackwoods teamed up with Porter Wagoner to record a country influenced gospel album called \"Grand Old Gospel\". It won a Grammy Award for Best Sacred Performance (Musical) and was the first of three albums the Blackwoods recorded with Wagoner. 1967's \"More Grand Old Gospel\" won a Grammy for Best Gospel Performance, along with 1969's \"In Gospel Country\". Wagoner performed with the Blackwoods for years and were guests at the Ryman Auditorium multiple times. In 1969, James Blackwood's oldest son, James \"Jimmy\" Blackwood, Jr., took over as the main lead singer for the group. Jimmy had been a member of the Junior Blackwood Brothers and the Stamps Quartet. They won another Grammy in 1973 for their project \"L-O-V-E\" on the RCA Camden label and then again in 1974 for \"Release Me From My Sin\". The group had 5-7 members at any given time with James Sr. and James Jr. sharing the lead, Bill Shaw and Cecil Blackwood on tenor and baritone, respectively, and John Hall and Conley \"London\" Parris taking over bass. The 1970s and 1980s lineup with Pat Hoffmaster, Jimmy Blackwood, Cecil Blackwood, Ken Turner and Tommy Fairchild had the Blackwood Brothers' biggest hit with \"Learning To Lean\". At the 22nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1980 they won another Grammy for \"Lift Up the Name of Jesus\" in the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance, Traditional category.\n\nJames Blackwood left the group in 1980 to form the Masters V quartet along with former Blackwood member J. D. Sumner and former Statesmen singers Jake Hess, Rosie Rozell, and Hovie Lister. The group continued and as did their commercial success. At the 23rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1981 \"We Come To Worship\" won a Grammy for best traditional gospel recording. It was produced by Cecil Blackwood's son, Mark Blackwood, and incorporated more contemporary sounds to the traditional Blackwood Quartet. At the 25th Annual Grammy Awards in 1983 \"Im Following You\" won the group's 8th and final Grammy for best traditional gospel recording. Much like \"We Come To Worship\", it blended elements of newer praise with the traditional southern gospel sound.\n\nCecil Blackwood died in November 2000, and James Blackwood in effect retired the Blackwood Brothers name. Mark Blackwood continued the heritage in grand style with \"Mark Blackwood and the Blackwood Gospel Quartet,\" eventually hiring tenor Wayne Little and bass singer Randy Byrd. In late 2004, Jimmy Blackwood joined Mark, and together they resurrected the Blackwood Brothers. However, Mark left in 2005, reforming his Blackwood Gospel Quartet, and was replaced with Brad White. Jimmy Blackwood, Wayne Little, Brad White, and Randy Byrd appeared on the Gaither Homecoming video \"Rock of Ages\" (2008). Soon after, White left and was replaced with Jimmy's younger brother, Billy. In 2012, Byrd was replaced with Butch Owens. Also in 2012, Jimmy Blackwood retired and was replaced by Michael Helwig. in 2017 Mike Helwig stepped down due to a battle with ALS and was replaced by Jonathan Mattingly.\n\nFormer tenor, Bill Shaw (1951-1973) died September 7, 2018. Former pianist Jackie Marshall died in 2018 as well.\n\nThe Blackwood Brothers have recorded over 200 albums and sold over 50 million records. They have won eight Grammy Awards, four Dove Awards, and have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Gospel Music Association (GMA) Hall Of Fame, the Southern Gospel Music Association (SGMA) Museum and Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the latter part of his life and career, James Blackwood formed The James Blackwood Quartet along with Ken Turner at bass, Larry Ford at tenor, and Jimmy Blackwood at baritone. The group performed a short while before folding in the late 1990s. Then, Ron Blackwood, the oldest son of R. W. Blackwood, who was one of the original members of the Blackwood Brothers Quartet and who was killed in the 1954 plane crash, formed \"The Blackwood Quartet\". He eventually merged with Mark Blackwood to form the current Quartet.\n\nThe Blackwood Brothers appeal has reached across the musical spectrum for generations. Elvis Presley named the Blackwood Brothers as his favorite gospel quartet growing up and knew the Blackwood Family personally, often inviting them to his Graceland home just to talk and fellowship even at the height of his popularity. He shared a stage with them in 1955 while on tour for the first time in Texas and refused to sing rock and roll out of respect for, and a desire to sing with his idols. Johnny Cash formed a strong relationship with the Blackwoods and the two acts performed with each other numerous times. Their song \"I Was There When It Happened\" can be heard singing on the radio towards the beginning of the movie \"Walk the Line (2005)\"—when Johnny Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) was in Memphis. In the film and according to Cash's autobiography, while auditioning to earn a spot on the Sun Records label in his early career, Cash performed gospel songs that the Blackwoods sang with regularity. They also appeared on \"The Johnny Cash Show\" and performed in 1971. At the end of the 2008 biopic film \"W.\", the Blackwood's rendition of \"\"Winging My Way Back Home\"\" was played. Currently, The Blackwood Quartet has been a frequent act with Willie Nelson and his Farmaid musical festival, usually closing out the festival with a rendition of \"I'll Fly Away.\" Ron Blackwood recently negotiated with Willie Nelson to record a Gospel Album with Mark Blackwood and The Blackwood Quartet to be released on Sony Records in late 2017. Ron has been in serious discussions with regards to recording an album with the Blackwood Quartet and Bob Dylan. Dylan spoke about the record at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards when he was named MusiCares Person of the Year in 2015 and in his speech expressed his desire to make another gospel album and the desire to sing the traditional gospel song \"Stand By Me\" on that album.\n\nBelow are some of the members:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2105418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105418", "title": "Portland Mavericks", "text": "Portland Mavericks\n\nThe Portland Mavericks were an independent professional baseball team in the northwestern United States, based in Portland, Oregon. They began play in the short-season Class A Northwest League in 1973, after the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League left after the 1972 season and became the Spokane Indians. The Mavericks operated as an independent club in Portland for five seasons, until the return of the PCL in 1978, and played home games on artificial turf at Civic Stadium in Portland.\n\nThe Mavericks were owned by ex-minor league player and television actor Bing Russell, and were initially the league's only independent club. As owner, Russell kept all corporate sponsorship outside the gates, and hired professional baseball's first female general manager, as well as the first Asian American general manager. Russell's motto in life was one three-lettered word: \"fun.\"\n\nEx-major leaguers and never-weres who could not stop playing the game flocked to the team's June try-outs, which were always open to anyone who showed up. Most of the Mavericks players were older than their opponents and had been released by other organizations, not all for baseball reasons alone. For this reason, Russell kept a 30-man roster because he believed some players deserved to have one last season.\n\nAmong the various castoffs who made up the Mavericks' roster was former major league pitcher Jim Bouton, who made a comeback with the Mavericks in 1975 after having been out of baseball since retiring in 1970.\n\nBing Russell's son, actor Kurt Russell, played for the club for a month in its inaugural season in 1973. The first-year Mavericks' Hollywood connection was not limited to the Russells; manager Hank Robinson (1923–2012) was a character actor, and players Robbie Robinson, Jason Tatar, and Ken Medlock all had long careers as actors. Perhaps the team's most successful Hollywood story is that of Maverick batboy Todd Field, who went on to have a long career as an actor before becoming a three-time Academy Award-nominated writer and director.\n\nOpen tryouts for the team in early June 1973 drew 150 hopefuls, including one who hitchhiked across the country from Tennessee. Longtime minor-league star Hank Robinson managed the Mavericks to a record of 45–35 and a South Division title in 1973, their first season, but was suspended for a year after punching an umpire in late August. The players were paid $300 per month.\n\nFollowing the first season, in November 1973, Bing Russell became the sole owner of the team, buying out co-owner John Carbray.\n\nThe Mavericks finished 50–34 in 1974 under new manager Frank Peters, finishing in second place in the newly formatted West Division, two games behind the Bellingham Dodgers.\n\nOwner Bing Russell made baseball history in November of that year when he promoted 24-year-old Lanny Moss to become the first female general manager in professional baseball.\n\nIn 1975, again under manager Frank Peters, the Mavericks played to a 42–35 record, finishing in first place in the newly aligned North Division. Aging knuckleballer Jim Bouton pitched five games, going 4–1 with a 2.20 ERA.\n\nThe Mavericks met the defending champion Eugene Emeralds (54–25) in a best-of-three league championship series. The Emeralds swept, taking game one in Portland, 5–1, with Bouton taking the complete game loss for the Mavericks, and the next game in Eugene, 1–0, in front of 5,326 at their Civic Stadium.\n\nUnder new manager Jack Spring, the Mavericks finished in first place in the North Division with a 40–32 record. (Team owner Bing Russell also served briefly as the interim manager in the dugout while manager Spring was out with a skull fracture in July.)\n\nThe Mavericks played the Walla Walla Padres of the South Division in the championship series in early September. The first game in Walla Walla at Borleske Stadium went to the Padres, 9–2. The second game in Portland the next afternoon was a 14–2 win for the Mavericks, which forced another game that night to decide the series, which Walla Walla won 7–6.\n\nIn their final and finest season, the Mavericks played to a 44–22 record under player/manager Steven Collette. They had the best record in the league, and won the southern division by 22 games, their third division title in as many seasons. The Mavericks attracted 125,300 fans to 33 regular season home dates (an average of almost 3,800 per game), setting a record for the highest short-season attendance in minor league history.\n\nPortland met the Bellingham Mariners, winners of the northern division at 42–26, in the championship series in late August. A noted member of the \"Baby M's\" was teenage outfielder Dave Henderson. The first game was in Bellingham and the home team won 6–2 before a paltry crowd of 575 at Civic Field, as Bouton again took the loss for the Mavericks. The series shifted to Portland, and 4,770 saw the Mavericks tie the series with eight runs in the fourth and cruised to a 10–1 win to force a third and final game in Portland the next night, Wednesday, August 31. The deciding game drew 7,805 fans, but the Mariners scored early and won 4–2 to secure the league title. Not known at the time, it was the final game in Portland Mavericks' history.\n\nSubsequently, Major League Baseball regained interest in Portland; when the Pacific Coast League expanded for the 1978 season, they added a new Portland Beavers team in January. The Mavericks shut down after the PCL paid Russell the highest payout for a minor league territory in history — $206,000 — when Russell took the matter to arbitration.\n\nIn contrast to the popularity of the Mavericks, the 1978 PCL Beavers drew only 96,395 fans to 69 home games, an average of under 1,400 per game.\n\nOn July 29th, 2014, the Portland Mavericks Baseball Club, Inc., was re-incorporated with the Secretary of the State of Oregon and is currently in good standing. The team is in development with the PBL League along with other teams to restart the team in 2022 in Portland, Oregon. \nIn 2017, a new website launched and announced that the Mavericks were returning as an independent team to start play in 2019. Due do some litigation this start date has been amended to 2022. The team also maintains Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin social media pages with news and updates. \n\n^ regular season finish\n\n\nThe team's success helped inspire the establishment of several independent minor teams — in the Mavericks' final season in 1977, three of the six teams in the league were independent. The following year saw four independents among the eight teams. The movement culminated in the establishment of several independent minor leagues beginning in the 1990s, including the Northern League.\n\nA documentary on the team, \"The Battered Bastards of Baseball\", debuted at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. The original documentary, \"Farewell Portland Beavers\" was the first to feature The Portland Mavericks, and aired on Portland TV station KOIN-TV in 1993, produced by Portland native, Kirk Findlay and Findlay Films.\n\n\n"}

For the most part it is a mud and rock-bottomed river flowing through forest and farmland. It is one of four distinct rivers in the state bearing the name \"Yellow River\".\n\nThis Yellow River begins at Matt Ochs Lake and Perch Lake in the township of Molitor near Perkinstown in the Chequamegon National Forest. This area of small lakes and swamps is the terminal moraine left by the last glacier, which reached this far about 18,000 years ago. The river runs a short way before it forms Chequamegon Waters Flowage, locally known as Miller Dam. Below Miller Dam, there is one more dam, at Cadott, forming another small reservoir, before the river joins the Chippewa River when it flows into Lake Wissota at Moon Bay.\n\nMuch of the Yellow is undeveloped - in particular the upper stretches through the Chequamegon Forest. In very few places will you see any sign of man. The only settlements along the river are Gilman and Cadott.\n\nMichel Cadotte started a trading post on the lower Yellow River at the current site of Cadott around 1787.\n\nLogging had begun on the upper Yellow by 1861, when a log-driving dam existed at Hughey. Many such log-driving dams were built to help flush logs out. By 1880 a \"winter road\" followed the river all the way up the river to Westboro. This would be a \"tote road\" used by logging operations to supply their crews working upstream.\n\nBruno Vinette, an early lumberman, tells of running a rapids on the Yellow:\nI remember once when the water was very high, Gilbert and Company, on the Yellow River, needed just one crib to complete a raft and offered me twenty-five dollars to bring it down. I rigged up a couple of oars and started down alone. A lot of people stood on the bank watching to see what would happen. Instead of giving me any trouble, the crib floated like a cork. I did not have to touch the oars, and in a few minutes was safe below the falls.\n\nIn flood stage the Yellow's currents are too strong for even the most skilled of swimmers.\n\nFishing in this river is some of the best in the area. The best spot is Chequamegon Waters, for bluegills, crappies, large mouth bass, northern pike, perch and the occasional walleye and smallmouth bass . The most common catch in the river is the northern pike and suckers. Wildlife abounds around the river including deer, bear, wolves, bobcat, coyote, ruffed grouse, beaver, otter, muskrat, mink, raccoon, turkey and waterfowl.\n"}

Such clauses are most prevalent in mortgages and similar contracts to purchase real estate in installments.\n\nSuppose, for example, the contract was for A to purchase Blackacre from B for $100,000, to be paid in 5 monthly installments of $20,000. If A makes the first two payments, but fails to make the third payment, an acceleration clause would require that A must immediately pay B the entire balance of $60,000, or lose his right to purchase Blackacre (without getting a refund of his $40,000).\n\nAn example of an acceleration clause is examined in the 1971 Rhode Island Supreme Court case of \"Scullian v. Petrucci\": There, the clause stated: \"In the event Purchaser defaults on any payment or fails to comply with any condition of this contract [...] the full amount shall be immediately due and payable[...]\". The court in that case found that the language of the clause required that default on the payment triggered the statute of limitations for the clause to be enforced.\n\nWithout the inclusion of an acceleration clause in a tenants standard lease, the right for the landlord to commence a lawsuit against the tenant for damages will amass upon the lease termination.\n\n"}

The sink falls within the larger Salton Trough and separates the Coachella Valley from the Imperial Valley, which are also segments of the Salton Trough. The lowest point of the sink is below sea level, and since 1906 the Salton Sea has filled the sink to .\n\nThe Salton Sink is the topographic low area within the Salton Trough, an active tectonic pull-apart basin. The Salton Trough is a result of crustal stretching and sinking by the combined actions of the San Andreas Fault and the East Pacific Rise. The Brawley seismic zone forms the southeast end of the basin and connects the San Andreas Fault system with the Imperial Fault Zone to the south. The Salton Buttes are rhyolite lava domes within the basin which were active 10,300 (± 1000) years BP.\n\nA large lake, Lake Cahuilla, existed in the area from about 20,500 to 3,000 years ago and left evidence as wave cut benches on the higher portions of the Salton Buttes. A beach mark outlines the shoreline of ancient Lake Cahuilla where archeologists found rock fish traps and charred remains of razorback sucker and bonytail bones. High water lines suggest the basin has filled many times, creating a lake some 105 miles (170 km) in length and nearly 300 feet (100 m) deep. Its most recent incarnation is evidenced by fish traps found some 30 feet (10 m) below the high-water mark that were estimated to be between 300 and 1,000 years old. \n\nIn recent times, the 1862 Colorado River flood waters reached the Salton Sink, filling it and creating a lake some 60 miles (95 km) long and 30 miles (50 km) wide. In 1884 and 1891 the Colorado River had escapement flow into the Salton Sink. The 1891 flood created a lake that covered an area 30 miles (50 km) long and 10 miles (15 km) wide. \nA larger 1905 Colorado flood escaped into a diversion canal, forming the Alamo and New Rivers and creating the current Salton Sea in the sink's Coachella Valley.

He began playing the C melody saxophone at age 12 and also played trumpet. At the age of 22, he began studying saxophone, flute, oboe, and clarinet with Dennis Sandole (1913–2000), an Italian American jazz guitarist who taught several jazz musicians in Philadelphia.\n\nHarley became inspired to learn the bagpipe after seeing the Black Watch perform in John F. Kennedy's funeral procession in November 1963. Then a maintenance worker for Philadelphia's housing authority, Harley began searching the city for a set of bagpipes. Failing to find one, he traveled to New York City, where he found a set in a pawn shop. He purchased the instrument for US$120, quickly adapting it to the idioms of jazz, blues, and funk. On several occasions, when a neighbor called the police to complain about Harley's practicing in his apartment, he would quickly put away his bagpipes and feign ignorance, asking the officers, \"Do I look like I'm Irish or Scottish to you?\" He eventually acquired a better set of bagpipes, which cost him a little over US$1,000.\n\nHarley made his bagpipe performance debut in 1964. From 1965 to 1970 he released four recordings as leader on the Atlantic label (all produced by Joel Dorn, an early supporter), also recording as a sideman with Herbie Mann, Sonny Stitt, and Sonny Rollins in the 1960s and 1970s. He later recorded with Laurie Anderson (appearing on her 1982 album \"Big Science\") and The Roots (on their 1995 album \"Do You Want More?!!!??!\"), the latter coming about due to a 1994 appearance on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\". In addition to bagpipes, on these albums he also occasionally played tenor saxophone, flute, or electric soprano saxophone.\n\nHarley often wore Scottish garb, including a kilt, in conjunction with a Viking-style horned helmet. After seeing him perform on television, a Scottish family gave him his tartan, the MacLeod tartan, which he wore for the rest of his life. His bagpipe technique was somewhat unorthodox in that he placed the drones over his right shoulder rather than his left. He favored the key of B-flat minor.\n\nHarley lived for much of his life in the Germantown neighborhood of Northwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and frequently gave presentations in Philadelphia-area public schools. During his frequent overseas performance tours, he carried and distributed miniature replicas of the Liberty Bell, the symbol of his hometown, as well as American flags and copies of the U.S. Constitution. He appeared on a number of television programs, including \"What's My Line?\", \"To Tell the Truth\" (March 22, 1965 and again c. 2000), \"I've Got a Secret\" (October 17, 1966), and \"The Arsenio Hall Show\". He also had a small role in Francis Ford Coppola's 1966 comedy film \"You're a Big Boy Now\", as well as \"Eddie and the Cruisers\" (1983). In addition to his performing career, he worked for the Philadelphia Housing Authority for many years.\n\nIn 1998 the CD album \"Brotherly Love\" was released, on the Tartan Pride label, alongside the book \"The Jazzish Bagpiper\", a photo anthology and conversations with Harley, by Charles A. Powell, the first to compliment Harley's contributions to American music with Celtic bagpipes. Writing in the sleeve notes for the album, Ralph Stevenson Jr., Harley's executive producer, noted:\n\nRufus Harley resides in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania home of the Liberty Bell. Harley, musical ambassador of the City of Brotherly love, has been received and embraced by tribal leaders, heads of state and many notables from around the world. His message of peace and love is blended in this CD collaboration and led by his dues paid, musical labor of sax and bagpipes.\nHis career included performances with many major figures including John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie and Dexter Gordon\n\nHarley died of prostate cancer at Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia on August 1, 2006. \n\nA posthumous retrospective on Rhino Handmade, \"Courage: The Atlantic Recordings\", was released in November 2006 as a 3,000-copy limited edition and contains all the tracks from his four Atlantic LPs, plus an unreleased track of Pete Seeger and Joe Hickerson's composition \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" recorded in 1969.\n\n\nWith Laurie Anderson\n\nWith Herbie Mann\n\nWith Sonny Rollins\n\nWith The Roots:\n\nWith Sonny Stitt\n\n\n\n"}

The institute emphasises development of analytical skills and a focus on global and cross-cultural issues with a balance between business demands and social concerns.\n\nIndian Institute of Management Kozhikode was instituted in 1996 by the Government of India in collaboration with the Government of the state of Kerala and the first batch of 42 students commenced in 1997 at the temporary campus at the National Institute of Technology Calicut. In 2000, the site of the present campus at Kunnamangalam was identified. The following year, Joseph Stein (also the architect of the India Habitat Centre in Delhi) and Stein Mani Chowla Architects began the design and construction of the institute. In 2003, IIM Kozhikode started using its hill-top campus. The then President of India, APJ Abdul Kalam inaugurated the campus.\n\nInteractive Distance Learning, an online management education programme for working executives, was introduced in 2001-02.

Having started with 300 class contact hrs in 2001-02, the year-long Executive Management Education Programme is today the richest available in the country having 450 class contact hours. The Management Development Programme was also introduced the same year. The institute increased the number of students in PGP to 180 in 2005.In the batch of 2013 the intake is around 361 for PGP. IIMK started its doctoral programme, Fellow Program in Management (FPM) in 2007. The intake of women in the PGP course was pro-actively increased to 30% from the batch of 2010-12 to increase the number of women in management roles in India. In 2010, IIMK signed a memorandum of understanding with Yale University to establish a Center of Excellence for Academic Leadership as part of Singh-Obama Knowledge Initiative.\n\nIIMK Kochi Campus was set up in August 2012.\n\nThe main campus is located in Kunnamangalam, a sub-urban area of Kozhikode (previously known as \"Calicut\"), Kerala. Kozhikode is the second largest city in Kerala. The campus is spread across two hills which are part of the Western Ghats. Besides classrooms, the campus also has residential facilities for students, faculty and visitors. The campus houses 17 hostels to house around 900 students who are required to stay on campus. Set up over 111 acres of land, the campus relies on rain water harvesting as its primary source of water. A couple of new Hostels - Hostel P and Hostel Q have come up recently and have been operational from the academic year 2018, Hostel N was operational from 2019. The campus,parked on top of a hillock, is a beauty when drenched in rain.\n\nIIM Kozhikode hosts a fully automated Library & Information Center (LIC) which is one of the Centers of Development of Digital Libraries in the world. The institute coordinated the South Asia Support Network for Greenstone Digital Library Software at the request of UNESCO and suggested the idea of IIM Library Consortium Movement. The library provides services as an institutional archive. A balanced programme on the development of the collection of hard copy, audio/video, CD-ROM, and other electronic forms of documents is being followed.\n\nIIM Kozhikode embarked on a programme to create a Museum of Indian Business History in 2010 which is believed to be the first of its kind. The museum will feature the contributions of India's business leaders, the history of trade, commerce, business and industries in India. The first phase was completed with a budget of Rs. 1.5 crore. The museum spanning 23000 sq. ft. features a large model of the Uru, an ancient ship which was used for trade and commerce between Indian and the rest of the world, and pavilions by Indian companies like Tata, Godrej, Reliance, State Bank of India and Infosys. The Reserve Bank of India gallery of the museum was inaugurated in 2012 by D.

The event was live streamed.\n\nThe institute's current full-time student body consists of 900 graduate students and 79 doctoral students. The admissions to PGP course is based on the Common Admission Test (CAT) conducted by the IIMs for admission to graduate programs in management at 20 campuses. CAT is considered by test-takers as one of the most competitive exams in the world, with a success rate of about one in hundred. In 2015, around 2.1 lakh students enrolled for CAT to get admission to the IIMs.\n\n49.5% seats in IIM Kozhikode are caste-based reserved quotas according to affirmative action policy of Government of India. 15% of the admitted students must be of the Scheduled Castes, and 7.5% of seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes. The Other Backward Classes belonging to the \"non-creamy layer\" have been provided with 27% reservation since 2008 with the consent of the Supreme Court of India. 3% seats are reserved for Persons with Disability (PWD or DA). The reserved category students are admitted based on the CAT score using relaxed admissions criteria.\n\nThe institute also uses group discussions, essays and personal interviews to evaluate the students shortlisted based on CAT scores. In 2013, for shortlisting candidates for group discussion/essay/personal interview, IIMK used an index computed with 50 percent weight for the CAT-2012 score, 15 percent weight for academic performance in secondary school, 15 percent weight for academic performance in higher secondary school, 15 percent weight for academic performance in undergraduate level and 5 percent weight for being a female (to ensure gender diversity). For FPM admissions, candidates with CAT, GMAT or GATE scores are eligible. In 2013, the PGP course of IIM Kozhikode had 54 percent girls, up from 28 percent in the previous academic year.\n\nIIMK was ranked sixth among management schools in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2018, seventh by \"The Week\" and \"Business Today\"s \"India's best B-schools 2019\" and fifth in India by \"Outlook India\"s \"Top Public MBA Institutions\" of 2020.\n\nIIM Kozhikode, like all IIMs, is an autonomous institution under Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India. The institute is free to design its own curriculum and recruit faculty members. In April 2011, Union Minister Kapil Sibal announced that the government is mulling enhancement of the autonomy of IIMs by allowing them to select the director and the chairman of Board of Directors. The PGP (Postgraduate Programme) and the ePGP (Executive Postgraduate Programme) courses have been granted international accreditation by the Association of MBAs (AMBA). IIM Kozhikode charges tuition fees of Rs. 13,00,000 for the two-year PGP programme. Merit scholarships are awarded by the institute to students on the basis of their grades during one academic year. Scholarships are also offered by trusts like Sir Ratan Tata Trust, HCIL, O.P Jindal Group etc.\n\nThe two-year MBA, is the flagship education program which aims to prepare young graduates for senior-level positions in industry. The institute stresses on a rigorous evaluation system and \"learning to learn\" approach through self-study, group work, open-ended discussions and real-life projects. The institute has also emphasized greater importance for social awareness and claims to distinguish itself from other IIMs in offering greater freedom to students in their intellectual pursuits. IIM Kozhikode is committed to give back to the society. In this regard, students are required to successfully complete 'Social Development Project (SDP)' wherein they propose solutions to key issues being faced by the society. Like all IIMs, IIM Kozhikode awards diplomas, not degrees.\n\nThe FPM program is a full-time, residential PhD program in the field of management. Students spend first two years doing coursework which provides fundamental knowledge in the field of management. Upon completion of their coursework, students take a comprehensive exam, and pass on to candidacy where they work on their dissertation. The program is selective, admitting 10-15 students per year. The management faculty provides individual attention to the enrolled PhD students to enable them to publish one or more research papers before graduation. The FPM program is primarily dedicated to training students for research positions in well-known universities and corporations.\n\nExecutive Post-graduate Programme offers a two-year post-graduate diploma programme in management and one year post-graduate certification programmes in General Management, Operations, Marketing, Finance, Strategy, IT and Human Resources. These programmes are aimed at working professionals with a minimum three years of experience. EPGP diploma programme have an interesting mix of student from different backgrounds with varied experience levels.\n\nThe EPGP program is accredited by the AMBA (Association of MBAs) since 2011. IIMK has been continuously updating the program curriculum to stay on par with global standards.\n\nPost Graduate Programme in Business Leadership (PGP-BL)\n\nThe one-year Post-Graduate Programme in Business Leadership is a uniquely designed management programme aimed at shaping young graduates with relevant work experience into potential business leaders through a high-intensity and holistic curriculum and regimen.\n\nIndian Institute of Management Kozhikode (IIMK) is currently on a high growth trajectory, offering the widest range of academic programmes in the field of management education and has consistently brought notable innovations to programmes design and delivery.

Typically controlled by yield signs, these allow U-turning traffic to bypass two traffic signals and avoid crossing the local traffic twice.\n\nIf the limited-access highway passes over the local road, the bridge (or bridges) must be longer, to span four directions of traffic and two sidewalks below. If the local road passes over the limited-access highway, the bridge must be wider, to carry four directions of traffic and two sidewalks over the highway.\n\nThis highway configuration originated (and is particularly common) in the U.S. state of Texas, especially in the Austin, Dallas–Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio metropolitan areas, but can also be found in Huntsville, Alabama; Peoria, Arizona; Little Rock and North Little Rock, Arkansas; Clearwater and Jacksonville, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Wichita, Kansas; Detroit, Michigan; Jackson, Mississippi; Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri; Las Cruces, New Mexico; New York City, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Lehi and Provo, Utah.\n\nIt is common in Michigan, where frontage roads travel along freeways. In some cases these are controlled by signals, and are similar to the Michigan left. They are also used less frequently in other areas of the world.\n\nAn unusual example of this configuration in the northeastern United States can be found at the Latham Circle, located in the hamlet of Latham, New York. Here, US Route 9 travels north-south underneath a roundabout carrying NY Route 2 east-west. In this case, the frontage roads are really the ramps which allow traffic from US Route 9 to connect to NY Route 2. These ramps are connected to two Texas U-turn ramps, which let motorists exiting adjacent businesses to travel in the opposite direction, and onto US Route 9.\n\nAnother example of this is in the Bronx, New York City at Rosedale Avenue by the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95) at exit 4B for motorists heading north on the Cross Bronx to turn and head back south or to connect to the northbound Bronx River Parkway without disturbing Rosedale Avenue. This is due to the nearby I-895 and East 177th Street not having direct connections to the Bronx River Parkway, which is also nearby.\n\nIn Queens, New York City, there is a Texas U-turn at I-678 near northbound exit 14 (Linden Place). This is so motorists can get to the nearby shopping center located to the west of I-678.\n\nIn Edmonton, Alberta, examples can be found along the Yellowhead Trail.\n\nIn London, United Kingdom, examples can be found beneath the Hammersmith flyover and also at the Hanger Lane gyratory.\n\nIn Birmingham, United Kingdom, an example can be found on the Queensway outside St. Chad's Cathedral.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, Texas U-turns are located at the junction between the Pacific Highway and the A3 (Ryde Road & Mona Vale Road).\n\nIn Nanjing, China, Texas U-turns are common along the Inner Ring Road.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 5, 1997. In the episode, Homer eats several hot chili peppers and hallucinates, causing him to go on a mysterious voyage. Following this, he questions his relationship with Marge and goes on a journey to find his soulmate.\n\n\"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\" was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Jim Reardon. The episode explores themes of marriage, community, and alcohol use. Homer's voyage features surreal animation to depict the elaborate hallucination. The episode guest stars Johnny Cash as the \"Space Coyote\".\n\nMarge tries to mask an odor by smoking cigarettes in the house, but after stepping outside Homer smells the scent of Springfield's annual chili cook-off. Marge admits trying to dissuade Homer from going due to his drunken antics at the previous year's cook-off. She agrees to let him attend after he promises to not drink beer.\n\nAt the cook-off, Homer shows an extraordinary ability to withstand hot foods, but is burned by Chief Wiggum's fiery chili made with Guatemalan insanity peppers. While quenching the heat with water, Homer nearly drinks melted candle wax by mistake before Ralph Wiggum warns him not to. Homer realizes he can use the wax to coat his mouth, enabling him to swallow several insanity peppers whole.\n\nAfter winning the chili-eating contest, Homer hallucinates wildly from the peppers. During his trip, he meets his spirit guide in the form of a coyote, who advises him to find his soulmate and questions Homer's assumption that Marge is his. Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy preacher's wife, tells Marge about Homer's antics; thinking they are alcohol-induced, Marge drives home without him.\n\nThe next day, Homer awakes on a golf course. He returns home to find Marge angry with him for his embarrassing behavior at the cook-off. He asks her to forgive him, but she refuses. Homer makes note of their fundamental personality differences and questions if they truly are soulmates.\n\nRoaming the streets at night, he thinks a lonely lighthouse keeper is his soulmate, but finds the lighthouse is operated by a machine once he arrives there. Seeing a ship approaching, Homer destroys the lighthouse's huge bulb, hoping its passengers will befriend him after their ship crashes ashore. Marge arrives, having known exactly where Homer would go. They reconcile after realizing they really are soulmates despite their differences. The ship runs aground nearby, spilling its cargo of hotpants. Springfield's citizens happily retrieve them as Marge and Homer embrace.\n\nThe episode was pitched as early as the third season by George Meyer, who was interested in an episode based on the books of Carlos Castaneda. Meyer had wanted to have an episode featuring a mystical voyage that was not induced by drugs, and so he decided to use \"really hot\" chili peppers instead. The staff, except for Matt Groening, felt it was too odd for the show at that point. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein resurrected the story, and decided to use it for season eight.\n\nMost of the hallucination sequence was animated completely by David Silverman. Silverman did not want the risk of sending it to South Korea, as he wanted it to look exactly as he had imagined it, including rendered backgrounds to give a soft mystical feel to the scene. The coyote was intentionally drawn in a boxier way so that it looked \"other-worldly\" and unlike the other characters. During Homer's voyage, the clouds in one shot are live-action footage, and 3D computer animation was used for the giant butterfly. During the same hallucination, Ned Flanders' line was treated on a Mac computer so that it increased and decreased pitch.\n\nThe Fox censors sent a note to the writers, questioning Homer coating his mouth with hot wax. The note read: \"To discourage imitation by young and foolish viewers, when Homer begins to pour hot wax into his mouth, please have him scream in pain so kids will understand that doing this would actually burn their mouths.\" The scream was not added; however, they did add dialog from Ralph Wiggum, questioning Homer on his action. The director also created a \"wax-chart\" for Homer for the animators to follow during the sequence when Homer's mouth is coated with candle-wax.\n\nHomer waking up on a golf course is a reference to something that actually happened: a friend of the producers blacked out and woke up on a golf course in another state. He had to buy a map from 7-Eleven to find out where he was. He discovered that not only was he in a different town, he was also in a different state. He walked several miles to return to a friend's house, which was the last place he remembered being the night before.\n\nJohnny Cash and Bob Dylan were the writers' top two choices to play the coyote; the writers had wanted to use one of The Highwaymen as the voice of the spirit guide. Dylan had turned the show down many times, having previously been offered a role in the season seven episode \"Homerpalooza\". Cash was offered the role, which he accepted. Matt Groening described Cash's appearance as \"one of the greatest coups the show has ever had\".\n\nThe main plot of the episode is based on the works of Carlos Castaneda, with some of the Native American imagery being similar to that used in the film \"Dances with Wolves\". The lighthouse keeper actually being a computer is a reference to the episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" called \"The Old Man in the Cave\", in which a man in a cave turns out to be a computer. The main theme from \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is used during the scenes when Homer walks into the chili festival, and the song \"At Seventeen\" by Janis Ian plays in the background as Homer walks through the town of Springfield looking for his soul-mate after he wakes up from his vision. The scene at the end of Homer's hallucination, when the train is heading towards him, is a reference to the opening titles of \"Soul Train\". Homer's record collection features albums by Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, and The Doodletown Pipers.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\" finished 34th in ratings for the week of December 30, 1996 – January 5, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 9.0, equivalent to approximately 8.7 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: \"Homer's chili-induced trip is brilliant, complete with the surreal tortoise and Indian spirit guide.\" The episode was placed eighth on AskMen.com's \"Top 10: Simpsons Episodes\" list, and in his book \"Planet Simpson\", Chris Turner named the episode as being one of his five favorites, although he found the ending too sentimental. In 2019, \"Time\" ranked the episode seventh in its list of 10 best \"Simpsons\" episodes picked by \"Simpsons\" experts.\n\nIn 2011, Keith Plocek of \"LA Weekly\"s Squid Ink blog listed \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\" as the best episode of the show with a food theme.\n\n\"IGN\" ranked Johnny Cash's performance as the 14th-best guest appearance in the show's history. Cash also appeared on AOL's list of their 25 favorite \"The Simpsons\" guest stars, and on \"The Times\" Simon Crerar's list of the 33 funniest cameos in the history of the show. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named Cash his third-favorite musical guest on \"The Simpsons\" out of a list of ten.\n\nFred Topel of Crave Online named it the best episode of the entire series.\n\n"}

Ballajura is located 14 km north of the Perth CBD. The postcode for the suburb is 6066.\n\nThe Ballajura area was first settled in 1905, when Ernest Maltby Kerruish, an immigrant from the Isle of Man, purchased land for a farm at the present site, which at the time was located in Caversham. He named it Ballajora, after a farm at Maughold on the Isle of Man. John Creer and Arthur Eaton, who also emigrated with Kerruish from the Isle of Man, joined him in clearing the land to build a house and begin farming the land. After a few years, Kerruish decided the soil was not fertile enough and moved his operations to an established vineyard in the present-day Caversham area, a few kilometres southeast.\n\nThe names Kerruish, Eaton, and Creer have been given to three of the four houses of Ballajura Primary School. The fourth is named after Matilda Bennett, a woman also of Manx descent who was the wife of John Septimus Roe, the first surveyor general of Western Australia under the first governor of the state, Sir James Stirling. Bennett Brook, a stream which ran through the Ballajora farm, was also named after Matilda Bennett.\n\nThe suburb was further developed in the 1980s with the development of two sub-divisions of Lakeshore and the Lakes Estate both becoming sought-after locations.\nBuilt around lakes and parks, they attracted a high quality of homes with the median price of housing within the subdivisions attracting prices 75-100% higher than of the rest of Ballajura.\nA proposal to officially rename the subdivisions was opposed by members of the local council, who expressed concerns that it would impact negatively on the remaining areas of Ballajura.\n\nIn the 2016 census of Population and Housing by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the population of the Ballajura postcode area was 18,704, in an area of .

He immigrated to the United States at age 14. He attended public schools in White Plains, New York.\n\nHe was inducted into the US Armed Forces and served in World War II, eventually settling in Valhalla, New York. Following the war, the G.I. Bill of Rights allowed him the opportunity to study composition at Manhattanville College and the Mannes College of Music. Santini studied composition with Felix Salzer and Tadeusz Kassern, and conducting with Milton Forstat.\n\nSantini developed a system of composition using 21-tone rows. This system is similar to the more familiar 12-tone system of serial composition, but the rows Santini used as the basis of his 21-tone compositions also include all alternative enharmonic spellings for each note in the chromatic scale (except the notes D, G, and A, which have no enharmonic spellings). Thus, the available tones for a 21-tone row would include B-sharp, C, C-sharp, D-flat, D, D-sharp, E-flat, E, F-flat, E-sharp, F, F-sharp, G-flat, G, G-sharp, A-flat, A, A-sharp, B-flat, B, and C-flat. In order to generate 21-tone rows, Santini utilized a specially printed deck of cards (each card representing one of the aforementioned pitches), \"dealing\" himself rows until he found the row or rows he wished to use as the basis for a particular composition.\n\nOther of Santini's innovations include the use of circular notation (in his \"Continuum\" for accordion), as well as quarter tones (which he referred to as \"quasi tones\"). His \"2+4,+\" calls for inside-the-piano playing as well as other techniques so avant-garde as to approach the theatrical, reminiscent of a John Cage \"happening.\"\n\nMany of Santini's other works are composed in a gentle, tonal, and more accessible style. Much of his output is for piano, and his numerous accordion works have been performed worldwide. His most widely performed composition, \"Ave Maria\", has been recorded by the duo of vocalist Mary Mancini and accordionist Mario Tacca.\n\nSantini's many works for orchestra include \"The White Peaks of Forca\" and \"Canti Gabrieleschi\". These works are also tonal, though modern in style, and draw on Santini's Italian heritage. His \"Canticum Angelicum\" was performed by the orchestra of the Teatro dell'Opera San Carlo in Naples. Among his last works is a concerto for viola and orchestra, composed with the 21-tone system.\n\nA devout Roman Catholic, much of Santini's output is sacred in nature, often with Latin texts. His \"Magnificat\" was selected for performance at the 1992 Incontri di Musica Sacra Contemporanea festival in Rome, Italy.\n\nSantini's music was self-published by his own company, DelSan Publications.\n\nUpon his retirement in 1981, Santini moved to Cape Coral in southwest Florida. He died in nearby Fort Myers in 2001.\n\n"}

A typical classification of the Austronesian languages ca. 1970 would divide them into something like the following branches:\n\n\nIt is now known that the Melanesian languages do not form a genealogical node: they are at best paraphyletic, and very likely polyphyletic; like Papuan, the term is now used as one of convenience, and sometimes placed in scare quotes. Although the term was at least in the beginning partially racial rather than linguistic, the Melanesian and other Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages are typologically similar, due to being the Austronesian languages most heavily restructured under the influence of various Papuan language families.\n\nMost of the languages of Melanesia are members of the Austronesian language family or one of the many Papuan families. By one count, there are 1,319 languages in Melanesia, scattered across a small amount of land.

Distinctive for its blue masthead as its logo and trademark, \"Utusan Malaysia\" was first published in Jawi in 1939. It became an influential medium for the people to voice out their opinions towards the ruling of the British Government in Malaya. Since 2018, the newspaper shifting its size from broadsheet to tabloid format.\n\nDespite initial reports that \"Utusan Malaysia\" and its sister papers \"Mingguan Malaysia\", \"Kosmo!\", and \"Kosmo! Ahad\" would be shutting down in mid-August 2019, the newspaper's publisher Utusan Group announced that they would continue publishing after receiving a RM$1.6 million cash injection from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Though \"Utusan\" ceased operations on 9 October 2019, it was subsequently reported that the newspaper would resume publication on 1 November 2019 after Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary's Aurora Mulia acquired a majority stake in Utusan's wholly owned subsidiary Dilof Sdn Bhd, however, the anticipated publication did not materialise.\n\nBut in January 2020, it was reported that \"Utusan Malaysia\" is set to be revived in several months' time, as some sources in the industry confirming that the \"Utusan\"'s new management is currently recruiting staff to start working in February and the newspaper is expected to be relaunched by April 2020, but it also did not take place.\n\n\"Utusan Malaysia\" traced its roots to 1939 when it was first published as \"Utusan Melayu\", with its address at Queen Street, Singapore. It was founded by Yusof Ishak, who later became the first President of Singapore, and Abdul Rahim Kajai, dubbed the father of Malay journalism. It temporarily suspended publication during the Japanese occupation of Malaya and Singapore. The newspaper moved its headquarters to Cecil Street, Singapore in 1945, and in 1959 relocated to Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"Utusan Malaysia\" started publication on 1 September 1967, being a romanised version for \"Utusan Melayu\" and daily edition of \"Mingguan Malaysia\". \"Mingguan Malaysia\" published 2 years earlier, on 30 August 1964.\n\nIn 1997, the Group made its entry into the world of multimedia with the launch of \"Utusan Malaysia Online\" (or simply \"Utusan Online\"), Malaysia's first online newspaper in full text and visuals. The service provided, in collaboration with Telekom Malaysia, enables pay-subscribers to read exact replicas of the Group's newspapers, including \"Utusan Malaysia\". On 2 July 2001, \"Utusan Education Portal\" (\"Portal Pendidikan Utusan\") was launched. The free service has received recognition from MIMOS (the \"Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic Systems\") as one of the top five education websites in Malaysia in 2001.\n\nOn September 16, 2018, to coincide with 55th anniversary of Malaysia's formation, \"Utusan Malaysia\" and its Sunday edition \"Mingguan Malaysia\" shifted from broadsheet to tabloid format. \"Utusan\" reportedly said the change in size was part of their effort to fulfil the needs and taste of their readers.\n\nOn February 8, 2019, \"Utusan\" is no longer under direct ownership by UMNO after 31.6 per cent stake of its parent company was acquired by Abd Aziz Sheikh Fadzir.\n\nOn 19 August 2019, the Utusan Group announced that \"Utusan Malaysia\", its Sunday paper \"Mingguan Malaysia\", and its sister papers \"Kosmo!\" and \"Kosmo! Ahad\" would cease their print editions on 21 August 2019 due to the company's financial woes and bankruptcy. \"Utusan Malaysia\" will continue its online operations. The decline of \"Utusan Malaysia\" readership and poor financial performance has been attributed by some to its pro-Barisan Nasional and Malay nationalist standpoint. Despite initial reports that the \"Utusan Malaysia\" would be shutting down, the Utusan Group reversed their decision after receiving a RM1.6 million cash injection from the United Malays National Organisation. To cover costs, the newspaper's price will be raised by 50 sen to RM 1.50 and \"Mingguan Malaysia\" price would be raised to RM 2.00 beginning 23 August 2019.\n\nIn spite of the financial injection, \"Utusan Malaysia\" and its sister papers continued to suffer losses and mounting debt from decreasing circulations, and it finally shuttered on 9 October 2019. On 10 October 2019, it was reported that the Utusan Group's newspapers would resume publication on 1 November 2019; however, the anticipated publication did not take place. Aurora Mulia, a company linked to business tycoon Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, had reportedly acquired a 70% stake in Utusan's wholly owned subsidiary Dilof Sdn Bhd. However, only some of \"Utusan\" 862 retrenched employees would be re-hired by the new management.\n\nIt was reported in January 2020 that \"Utusan Malaysia\" and its sister publication, \"Kosmo!\" would be relaunched by April 2020.\n\nThe newspaper's first building was located at Queen Street, Singapore in 1939. In 1958, it moved to Kuala Lumpur.\n\nA new seven-storey high office building was erected in 2010, opposite the existing headquarters. It was built on the former site of a car park for its staff. The official move to the new Kumpulan Utusan premises took place in 2013.\n\nDistinctive for its blue masthead as its logo and trademark, \"Utusan Malaysia\" had over 32 pages of news and current affairs, with regular supplements, focusing on such diverse topics as entertainment, fashion, music, health, technology, and politics. It was Malaysia's only broadsheet newspaper in a national language until 16 September 2018, when it switched to tabloid newspaper.\n\nMingguan Malaysia, Utusan's weekend edition, had a red masthead. Sections such as Pancawarna and Pancaindera (entertainment section) are published in tabloid size, rather than broadsheet.\n\nUtusan Malaysia's circulation peaked at 350,000 copies a day in the 1990s and it was one of the largest selling newspapers in Malaysia. Circulation had declined by about 250,000 in 2004 and further down to 144,438 copies in first half of 2016. Mingguan Malaysia, the Sunday edition of Utusan Malaysia, had a circulation of 313,495 on first half of 2016, which made it the most popular newspaper in the Malay language.\n\n\"Utusan\" frequently stoked racist sentiments with provocative headlines championing the Dasar Ekonomi Baru and Ketuanan Melayu.\n\nJust one day after the 2013 general elections, in which the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition suffered what was until then its worst-ever results, \"Utusan\" published a highly racist feature article with the headline \"\"Apa lagi Cina mahu?\"\" (\"What else do the Chinese want?\") accusing Chinese Malaysians of trying to overthrow the Malay-dominated government and labelling them \"ungrateful\". Third-party analysts have noted that the massive electoral swing could be attributed to urban votes of all races deserting the ruling coalition wholesale, rather than pinpointed to any particular race. Despite Prime Minister Najib Razak's defence of the newspaper, \"Utusan\" earned widespread condemnation from Malaysians for its unapologetic race-baiting.\n\nIn view of \"Utusan\" extreme racist rhetoric, the former Opposition-led Perak state government staged a boycott against the newspaper, with other Opposition states following suit. A motion was also set by the Selangor state government to boycott \"Utusan\" while all Selangor state agencies and departments were told to refrain from buying and advertising in the newspaper, in a move to protest a short story titled \"\"Politik Baru YB J\"\" by columnist Datuk Chamil Wariya that appeared in the paper which mentioned the assassination of a fictional character resembling Democratic Action Party assemblywoman Teresa Kok.\nStatements by Chief Ministers in then Opposition-held states were out of context, manipulated, or otherwise downright fabricated.\n\nIn January 2011, the newspaper suspended a senior journalist, Hata Wahari, president of the National Union of Journalists, after alleging that Hata had brought the newspaper into disrepute and \"insulted\" its management. Hata was later dismissed from the Utusan group in May of that year. On 20 May 2013, Hata staged a one-man protest in front of the Utusan Melayu headquarters, calling for an end to \"irresponsible journalism\" and \"racist reporting\". He was consequently jeered and labelled a \"communist\" by the \"Utusan\" staff gathered there, who also hurled two packets of fried bihun at him.\n\nThe widely perceived view that \"Utusan Malaysia\" was nothing more than a propaganda newsletter for the ruling government was given much greater credence after its deputy chief editor Zaini Hassan openly stated in a forum organised by the National Civics Bureau that it was acceptable for \"Utusan\" to \"spin facts\" to be \"biased in our [the BN Government's] favour\". The \"Malaysiakini\" reporter covering the forum was later barred from attending.\n\nUtusan offered an apology after running news of an 87-year-old Catholic missionary in Java who purportedly converted to Islam after recovering from a coma. It later turned out that the article was sourced from a fictional news story on a satirical website, the World News Daily Report.\n\nNumerous lawsuits were filed against \"Utusan\" by several personalities from the former Pakatan Rakyat coalition. Notably, Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng successfully sued for libel twice against the paper, winning RM400,000 in accumulated damages for both lawsuits.\nOn 14 December 2012, Karpal Singh was awarded RM50,000 in damages after a High Court judge declared that an \"Utusan\" article painting him as anti-Islam was \"by all accounts mischievous\".\n\nOn 21 January 2013, the High Court awarded Anwar Ibrahim RM45,000 in damages after a series of \"Utusan\" articles deliberately misrepresented his statement in a BBC interview so as to suggest that the opposition leader was pro-LGBT (a controversial stance in Muslim-majority Malaysia). The paper's lawyer triggered significant uproar during proceedings when he argued that newspapers did not have the \"luxury of time\" to ascertain the truth of their reports.\n\n\"Utusan\" won the \"IFRA Publish Asia 2003 Award\" for the \"Best in Print\" category on 20 March 2002. It was the first award to be won by the newspaper at the international level.\n\nIn 2014, it won two awards in Johor Media Award 2014.\n\n\n"}

This is the second story written by Robert Holmes, one of the show's most successful scriptwriters, who would subsequently rise to become Script Editor on the show in the Tom Baker era. Only one of the six episodes is held in the BBC archives; five remain missing.\n\nSpace beacons on the space lanes are being blown up and plundered for precious argonite by a gang of space pirates led by Caven, and his associate Dervish. The Earth Space Corps cruiser V-41 notices the destruction of the beacon and, with General Hermack and Major Warne in charge, sets out to apprehend the pirates. Another beacon is destroyed despite their best intentions, and the fragments are stolen using rocket propulsion. Hermack deploys troops to all nearby Beacons to prevent another robbery.\n\nThe TARDIS crew arrive on Beacon Alpha Four shortly before the pirates reach it. Caven and his men murder the security force there, the only survivor is Lt Sorba who is taken as a hostage and the pirates seal the time travellers in part of the Beacon before blowing it to pieces. Fortunately the beacon falls into discrete, sealed pieces and the Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe find themselves inside one. The eccentric Milo Clancey, in his aged ship, the LIZ-79, rescues them – but they cannot retrieve the TARDIS, which is in a separate segment taken by the pirates.\n\nThe nearest inhabited world is Ta, dominated by the Issigri Mining Corporation, whose leader is Madeleine Issigri. The firm was founded by her father and Clancey, and the latter is now suspected of Dom Issigri’s murder, though nothing has been proved. Hermack visits Ta, believing that Clancey, whom he suspects of being the pirate leader, will end up there in due course – and he is right. However, Hermack leaves just as Clancey and the TARDIS crew reach Ta. Zoe has plotted the trajectory of the segments of Beacon and believes they were destined for Ta too and the Doctor and his companions soon find the pirate headquarters. They evade capture and make contact with Clancey.\n\nMeanwhile, Caven forces Dervish to reroute some of the beacon fragments to Lobos, a frontier world where Clancey has his base, so as to throw suspicion on the prospector. It is clear that someone has tipped him off about the Corps suspicion of Milo Clancey. Hermack and his crew see through this ruse, but it takes time, and they spend hours orbiting Lobos while the real action is taking place on Ta.\n\nWhen the Doctor and his party reach Madeleine’s offices it becomes clear that she is in league with Caven, and the Doctor and his friends are imprisoned, while Sorba is killed. Their prison is the study of Dom Issigri – alive but frail and scared – and it takes time for him to recover his wits. Madeleine has meanwhile decided to break her alliance with Caven, and does so by radioing Hermack to bring his troops to Ta. Caven reasserts his authority by telling Madeleine her father is alive and threatening to kill him unless she returns to her compliant self. She responds by contacting Hermack again and telling him not to come to Ta.\n\nThe Doctor and his friends have meanwhile escaped, taking the weak Dom Issigri with them, and head to the LIZ-79. Caven has thought ahead and forced Dervish to cut the oxygen supply to the ship. As only Milo and Dom board the ship, theirs are the lives in danger, and Caven’s callousness finally convinces Madeleine to support him no longer. The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe save their friends and Dom Issigri makes contact with Hermack, persuading him of the truth of the situation.\n\nCaven now gets desperate, threatening to destroy Ta, the Issigri base, and the orbiting V-ship by means of a series of bombs. The Doctor manages to disengage the triggering device, while Major Warne blows Caven and Dervish’s ship to pieces. As Hermack’s ship lands, Madeleine looks forward to a reunion with her father, but knows she will also be imprisoned for her part in the conspiracy, while the Doctor and his companions prepare to seek out the TARDIS on one of the fragments of the Beacon.\n\n Episode is missing\n\nThis serial was written as a replacement for \"The Dream Spinner\" by Paul Wheeler, which for technical reasons was dropped at a late stage in production. This is the last story to be produced by Peter Bryant, although it was originally intended that he receive the producer's credit on \"Doctor Who and the Silurians\". This changed when Barry Letts was appointed the series' producer on a full-time basis.\n\nPatrick Troughton, Frazer Hines and Wendy Padbury were all away on location filming \"The War Games\" during the production of episode six and appear only in pre-filmed inserts. Thus, this is one of only two 1960s episodes to have none of the regular cast present for a studio recording, the other being the 1965 story \"Mission to the Unknown\".\n\nThis was the first \"Doctor Who\" serial which John Nathan-Turner worked on as a floor assistant. Nathan-Turner would become the Unit Production Manager of the show in 1977 and the Producer in 1980, a role he hold until the series' cancellation in 1989.\n\nAll episodes, except Episode 2 (preserved as a 35 mm film telerecording), are missing from the BBC archives. Pre-filmed inserts from Episode 1 also exist, as well as the audio soundtrack for all episodes. Episode 6 of the story is chronologically the final missing episode of \"Doctor Who\".\n\nIn 1998, Episode 2 of this story (the single episode already held in the BBC archives) was discovered in the collection of an amateur video enthusiast. The episode is the earliest known existing off-air domestic videotape recording of an episode of \"Doctor Who\".\n\nThis is the final story, which is considered to have episodes missing due to no video being known to exist. Whilst part 1 of the Third Doctor story \"The Mind of Evil\" is missing its authentic colour image data, it still has complete video, even if only available in either monochrome (on VHS) or manually colourised form (on DVD).\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in March 1990.\n\nEpisode 2 was released on VHS in 1991 on \"Doctor Who - The Troughton Years\", the introduction for the episode being recorded in the Lime Grove Studios where Episode One had been taped.

{"id": "2105734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105734", "title": "Nevadan orogeny", "text": "Nevadan orogeny\n\nThe Nevadan orogeny occurred along the western margin of North America during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time which is approximately from 155 Ma to 145 Ma. Throughout the duration of this orogeny there were at least two different kinds of orogenic processes occurring. During the early stages of orogenesis an \"Andean type\" continental magmatic arc developed due to subduction of the Farallon oceanic plate beneath the North American Plate. The latter stages of orogenesis, in contrast, saw multiple oceanic arc terranes accreted onto the western margin of North America in a \"Cordilleran type\" accretionary orogen. Deformation related to the accretion of these volcanic arc terranes is mostly limited to the western regions of the resulting mountain ranges (Klamath Mountain range and Sierra Nevada) and is absent from the eastern regions. In addition, the deformation experienced in these mountain ranges is mostly due to the Nevadan orogeny and not other external events such as the more recent Sevier and Laramide Orogenies. It is noted that the Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada share similar stratigraphy indicating that they were both formed by the Nevadan orogeny. In comparison with other orogenic events, it appears that the Nevadan Orogeny occurred rather quickly taking only about 10 million years as compared to hundreds of millions of years for other orogenies around the World (ex. Trans-Hudson orogeny).\n\nThe Nevadan Orogeny began with the formation of a continental volcanic arc due to east dipping subduction of the Farallon Plate beneath the North American Plate. Continued subduction of oceanic crust transported multiple oceanic arc terranes to the western margin of North America where they were accreted onto the edge of the continent. During the accretion of the arc terranes onto North America, the sediment and crustal material between North American and the incoming arc terrane were thrust onto the continent forming ophiolite sequences that are preserved in both the Klamath Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. These mountain ranges are located in northern California-southern Oregon, and central California respectively. The accretion of arc terranes resulted in the generation of three distinct belts in the Sierra Nevada: the Western belt, Central belt, and Eastern Belt. The Klamath Mountains are somewhat more complex in their overall structure than the Sierra Nevada.\n\nThe rocks of the Western belt comprise dominantly sedimentary rocks including greywacke and mudstone that have undergone deformation. In the southern part of the Western Belt the rocks have undergone folding as the main type of deformation. The Western Belt is generally separated from the Central Belt by the Melones fault zone which also distinguishes between the metamorphic rocks of the Western and Central Belts of the Sierra Nevada. The Western Belt rocks are interpreted to be a part of the Slate Creek terrane, which was accreted onto the western margin of North America at approximately 150 Ma. The age of these rocks was dated using potassium-argon dating (K-Ar). At the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada there are numerous dikes that have intruded the rocks that range in age from 148-155 Ma. These dikes are proposed to have been formed when the North American plate underwent a change in motion direction so that subduction was no longer occurring in a northeast direction but in the southeast direction. The shear sense along the dikes is a sinistral shear sense which indicates later southeast subduction of the oceanic plate.\n\nThe Central belt of the Sierra Nevada consists of rocks from the Tuolumne River terrane which were accreted onto the western Margin of North America at an earlier time (>150 Ma) than the rocks of the Slate Creek terrane. In general there are two different zones in the Central belt, which are the Calaveras greenschist complex and the Shoo Fly complex. The Calaveras-greenschist complex is located in the western half of the Central Belt and essentially consists of volcanic arc rocks along with small amounts of chert and argillite. The Shoo Fly complex is to the East of the Calaveras greenschist complex and is dominated by quartz sandstone with small amounts of limestone and phyllite. K-Ar dating of the Tuolumne River terrane indicates it is between 190-170 Ma in age. During this time there would have been significant amounts of folding and thrust faulting near the collision zone for both the Tuolumne River terrane and the existing Northern Sierra Terrane. However, most of the deformation that would have been experienced in the collision was restricted to the Tuolumne River Terrane as minimal deformation is seen in the Eastern Belt.\n\nThe eastern belt of the Sierra Nevada consists of the Northern Sierra Terrane. The Northern Sierra Terrane was formed from volcanism at the western edge of North America due to the subduction of an oceanic plate, which eventually resulted in the accretion of the Tuolumne River and Slate Creek terranes to North America. This is analogous to the \"Andean\" style of orogenesis where subduction of an oceanic plate to approximately 110 km beneath the surface of Earth results in melting of the down-going slab and convecting asthenosphere. This melting may be assisted by the presence of water in what is known as Flux melting. The melt from the slab then rises up through the asthenosphere and through the crust to create large batholiths and volcanism. Although deformation in the western and central regions of the Sierra Nevada is widespread, deformation from the Nevadan Orogeny in the Eastern Belt is somewhat limited. It was determined that the deformation was minimal in the Eastern Belt by looking at dikes that had intruded the rocks which appeared to be mostly undeformed. These mostly undeformed dikes were dated using the K-Ar method and were determined to be between 169 and 209 Ma in age, which implies they were placed well before any deformation related to the Nevadan Orogeny would have occurred. As the age of these dikes are older than the deformation of the Nevadan Orogeny, it is evident that most of the deformation took place towards the western side of the Sierra Nevada, rather than in the eastern regions.\n\nThe Klamath Mountains tell a similar story to the Sierra Nevada in that they are the product of multiple different accretionary events of island arc terranes. The current proposed model for the formation of the Klamath mountains involves multiple stages. The first stage of the formation of the Klamath mountains was arc magmatism on the western coast of North America which resulted in the formation of the Western Hayfork Terrane. Once the Western Hayfork Terrane was formed (and had subsequently stopped forming) the region was intruded by mafic dikes attributed to some form of extension at approximately 160 Ma. Once extension ceased in the area, compression began again, resulting in the closure of a very small back arc basin produced by the extension and accreted the ophiolite sequences seen in the Klamath Mountains from the Nevadan Orogeny time (Josephine Ophiolite at 155 Ma). Continued convergence in the Klamath Mountains region would eventually lead to the emplacement of dikes and sills within the Josephine Ophiolite at approximately 153 Ma. The youngest of the accretionary ophiolite sequence in the Klamath Mountains appears to be the Josephine Ophoilite, which is dated to be about 155 to 150 Ma in age using both argon-argon (Ar-Ar) and lead-uranium (Pb-U) methods. Rather than being thrust on top of North America, the Josephine Ophiolite was accreted through a different process that involved being thrust underneath of North America and then eventually being exhumed at the surface. In the Klamath Mountains it has also been observed that there is two other plutons of rock that were accreted during the Nevadan Orogeny, the Abrams and Salmon mica schists of the Stuart Fork Formation. Using the potassium-argon (K-Ar) method of isotopic dating on phyllite, the age of metamorphism in the Stuart Fork Formation was determined to be about 148 Ma. The metamorphism related to the phyllite in the Stuart Fork Formation is from the older Abrams and Salmon mica schists being thrust on top of the Stuart Fork rocks during the end of the Nevadan Orogeny.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada and the Klamath Mountains were the result of continental magmatic arc and then oceanic arc accretion during the Nevadan Orogeny between 155-145 Ma. At nearly the same time the Eastern Belt of the Sierra Nevada was forming, the Western Hayfork Terrane of the Klamath Mountains was being constructed. As the Nevadan Orogeny progressed, the Tuolumne River Terrane was accreted to the Sierra Nevada at approximately the same time as the formation of the Josephine Ophiolite in the Klamath Mountains (150-155 Ma). During the last stages of orogenesis, the sedimentary rocks of the Western Belt were accreted to the Sierra Nevada while the Abrams and Salmon mica schists were thrust on top of the Stuart Fork Formation in the Klamath Mountains.\n"}

{"id": "2105749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105749", "title": "Romanian Land Forces", "text": "Romanian Land Forces\n\nThe Romanian Land Forces () is the army of Romania, and the main component of the Romanian Armed Forces. In recent years, full professionalisation and a major equipment overhaul have transformed the nature of the Land Forces.\n\nThe Romanian Land Forces was founded on . It participated in World War I, together with the Russian Empire forces in actions against the Central Powers and, despite initial setbacks, won the decisive battles of Mărăşti and Mărăşeşti. During most of World War II (until August 23, 1944) Romanian forces supported the Axis powers, fighting against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. From August 1944 until the end of the war, Romania fought against Germany under the control of the Soviet Union. When the communists seized power after the Second World War, the army underwent reorganisation and sovietization.\n\nFollowing the Romanian Revolution, due to shortage of funds, many units were disbanded and much equipment was phased out. Likewise, Romanian military capability declined because of a lack of fuel as well as training. However, since the late 1990s, a number of positive changes have come about and the level of combat readiness is growing greatly; since 1996, the military budget has grown more than four times - rising from 636 million dollars to 2.8 billion dollars in 2007. Conscription has been abolished and professionalisation has been completed.\n\n\nThe first attempt to create an independent Romanian army was made by Gheorghe Magheru during the 1848 Wallachian Revolution, and it was based at Râureni (now part of Râmnicu Vâlcea). However, Magheru ordered his troops to disband when the Ottoman forces swept into Bucharest to stop the revolution.\n\nThe current Romanian Land Forces were formed in 1859, immediately after the unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, and were commanded by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, \"Domnitor\" of Romania until his abdication in 1866. In 1877, at the request of Nikolai Konstantinovich, Grand Duke of Russia the Romanian army fused with the Russian forces, and led by King Carol I, fought in what was to become the Romanian War of Independence. They participated in the Siege of Plevna and several other battles. The Romanians won the war, but suffered about 27,000 casualties. Until World War I, the Romanian army did not face any other serious actions.\n\nThe Romanian Army entered the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, allowing Romania to annex Southern Dobruja (also known as the Cadrilater). Although some 330,000 troops were mobilised, the Romanians met little resistance in Bulgaria and as such this is not considered a major conflict in Romanian history. This was due to historical claims on land and the area no longer belongs to Romania.\n\nOn July 6, 1916, Royal Romania declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary, following the initial success of the Brusilov Offensive (a major Russian offensive against the armies of the Central Powers on the Eastern Front). The Romanian armies entered Transylvania (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), together with Russian forces. However, German forces under the command of General Erich von Falkenhayn stalled the attack in November, 1916, and drove back the Romanians. At the same time, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman forces invaded southern Romania, forcing the country into a two-front war. The Central Powers drove deep into Romania and conquered the southern part of the country (Wallachia, including Bucharest) by the end of 1916. The Romanian forces, led by Marshal Constantin Prezan, retreated into the north-east part of Romania (Moldavia). In the summer of 1917 however, Prezan, aided by the future Marshal, General Ion Antonescu, successfully defended the remaining unoccupied territories against German and Austro-Hungarian forces led by Field Marshal August von Mackensen. General Alexandru Averescu led the Second Army in the victories of the Battle of Mărăşti (July 22 to August 1, 1917) and the Battle of Mărăşeşti (August 6 to September 8, 1917). As a result of the Russian Revolution, Romania was left isolated and unable to continue the war, and was forced to sign the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers. Later on, in 1919, Germany agreed, in the Treaty of Versailles Article 259, to renounce all the benefits provided to it by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918. After the successful offensive on the Thessaloniki front, which put Bulgaria out of the war, Romania re-entered the war on November 10, 1918, a day before its end in the West.\n\nAfter World War I, in December 1918, the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary proclaimed a union with the Kingdom of Romania. Later on, in April 1919, the newly-established Hungarian Soviet Republic vowed to retake occupied territories by force, and Hungarian troops attacked Romanian formations in Transylvania. The Romanian Army defeated the Hungarians and occupied Budapest in August 1919.\n\nAfter General (later Marshal) Ion Antonescu took power in September 1940, Fascist Romania signed the Tripartite Pact with the Axis Powers and subsequently took part in Operation Barbarossa in 1941. An expeditionary force invaded the Soviet Union in Bessarabia and southern Ukraine, alongside the Wehrmacht. The expeditionary force, 'Army Group Antonescu,' was composed on 22 June 1941 of the 3rd Army, the 4th Army, the 2nd Army Corps, and the 11th Infantry Division. The 3rd Army comprised the 4th Army Corps (6th and 7th Infantry Divisions), the Cavalry Corps, the Mountain Corps, two separate artillery battalions, a TA unit, and the Air Force's 3rd Army Cooperation Command. The 4th Army consisted of the 3rd Army Corps, the 5th Army Corps, the 11th Army Corps (two fortress brigades), and the 4th Army Cooperation Command. The army group-level 2nd Army Corps, under Major General N. Macici, controlled the 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions and the 7th Cavalry Brigade. Additionally the 1st Armoured Division was formed for service on the Eastern Front. The Army Group's first offensive, in conjunction with the Eleventh Army, Operation Munchen, enabled Romania to retake the territory immediately east of the Dnister, former part of Moldavia. The Romanian armies saw their first major battles at Odessa and Sevastopol, and in 1942 advanced with other Axis forces deeper into Soviet territory during Operation Blue.\n\nThe worst defeat for the Romanian expeditionary force on the Eastern Front occurred at Stalingrad, where, during the Soviet counter-offensive of November 1942, the thinly spread forces of the Third Army (deployed north of Stalingrad) and of the Fourth Army (deployed south of Stalingrad) were attacked by vastly superior Soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some 158,000 personnel.\n\nDuring April–May 1944 the Romanian forces led by General Mihai Racoviţǎ, together with elements of the German Eighth Army were responsible for defending Northern Romania during the Soviet First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive, and took part in the Battles of Târgu Frumos. In late August 1944, the Red Army entered eastern Romania. On August 23, 1944, a coup led by King Michael I of Romania deposed Marshal Antonescu and set up a pro-Soviet government. It has been estimated that the royal coup shortened the war by six months. Romania soon declared war on Nazi Germany, and the First and Fourth Armies were pressed into action. After expelling the last of the Wehrmacht units from Romania, the Romanian armies took part in the Siege of Budapest and the Prague Offensive of May 1945.\n\nThe Soviet occupation of Romania led to a complete reorganisation of the Romanian Land Forces under the supervision of the Red Army. At the onset, pro-German elements were purged from the Romanian armed forces. In 1944–45, two divisions were formed out of Romanian volunteers—ex-prisoners of war, trained and indoctrinated in the Soviet Union during the war, but also of many Communist activists. One was the Tudor Vladimirescu First Volunteer Division, under the command of Colonel Nicolae Cambrea, and the other the Horia, Cloşca şi Crişan Division, under the command of General Mihail Lascăr (who later served as Minister of Defence from 1946 to 1947). These two units formed the nucleus of the new Romanian Land Forces under Soviet control. The postwar reorganisation of the Land Forces included cavalry but the arm disappeared from the force with the disbandment in November 1954 of the 59th Cavalry Division at Oradea.\n\nAfter the Romanian Workers' Party seized political power, the sovietization of the army commenced, under the supervision of the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.\n\nIn the early 1950s the RLF reached a level of 12 rifle, one mechanised, and one tank division. Between 1960 and 1964 the rifle and mechanised divisions were converted to mechanized (motorized rifle) divisions, and reductions in strength began; force size dropped to six mechanized divisions and one armored division by 1968. From 1970 to 1976, two more motor rifle divisions and one armored division were formed, and the eight motor rifle and two armored division figure remained that way for the rest of the Cold War. In case of war, at least four other motorized infantry divisions and one tank division could have been formed.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1960 the country seems to have been divided into three major military regions: Cluj, Bacău, and Bucharest in the west, east, and south, respectively. In wartime the land forces in each military region would become an army corps with their headquarters in Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, and Bucharest. Armies seem to have succeeded military regions in 1960, and three armies seem to have become four in 1980. What is known is that on 01.07.1947 Fourth Army became 3rd Military Region, based in Cluj. The 3rd Military Region became the 3rd Army on 30 April 1960, and the 4th Army on 5 April 1980.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the land forces numbered 140,000 personnel, of whom two thirds were conscripts. In 1989 four armies appeared to exist: the First Army at Bucharest, Second Army at Buzau, Third Army at Craiova, and Fourth Army at Napoca. In 1989 the land forces consisted of eight mechanised (infantry) divisions (1st, Bucharest, 2nd, Craiova, 9th, Constanta, 10th, Iași, 11th, Oradea, 18th, Timişoara, 67th, Brăila and 81st, Dej) two armored divisions (the 57th Tank Division at Bucharest and the 6th Tank Division at Târgu Mureş), one armored brigade, four mountain (infantry) brigades, and four parachute infantry regiments. According to the 165-year 'History of Modern Romanian Artillery,' in 1989 the 1st Army Command consisted of the 1st Mechanized Division, 57th Tank Division and the 2nd Mountain Brigade; the 2nd Army Command of the 9th Mechanized Division, 10th Mechanized Division, 67th Mechanized Division and 32nd Tactical Missile Brigade; the 3rd Army Command of the 2nd Mechanized Division, 18th Mechanized Division, the 7th Tank Brigade and the 4th Mountain Brigade; and the 4th Army Command of the 11th Mechanized Division, 81st Mechanized Division, 6th Tank Division, the 1st and 5th Mountain Brigades and the 37th Tactical Missile Brigade.\n\nThe mechanized divisions were organized along the Soviet model with three mechanized infantry regiments, one tank regiment, and a full complement of 10,700 infantry soldiers, having 130 main battle tanks, 216 wheeled armoured personnel carriers (APCs), 30 wheeled armoured reconnaissance vehicles, 18 light SPGs SU-76, 54 towed 120mm. M-38/-43 (or Md.1982 120mm. Romanian made) mortars, 36 towed 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30) and 12 truck-mounted (Romanian production) 122mm. multiple rocket launchers APR-40 (which will become later, after an extensive modernization, the LAROM missile system). Compared to similar Soviet, Hungarian or Bulgarian divisions, the Romanian ones were more poorly equipped, both in terms of number and quality of heavy weapons. The armored divisions were composed of 3 tank regiments and one mechanized infantry regiment plus support units. The artillery, antitank, and air defence regiments of divisions provided specialised fire support that enabled motorised rifle and tank regiments to maneuver. Each of the four Army Commands comprised an antiaircraft artillery brigade and a ground-to-air missile regiment. Three of the four ground-to-air missile regiments were equipped with 2K12 Kub systems, and the fourth regiment with 9K33 Osa systems. In the late 1980s the artillery regiments of mechanized and tank divisions included two artillery battalions and one multiple rocket launcher battalion.\n\nIn terms of their combat equipment, the RLF operated a total of 2825 tanks: 1059 outdated (soviet WW-2 type) T-34-85 tanks, 785 soviet and Czechoslovak T-55/-55A/-55AM tanks, 415 Romanian built TR-77-580, 535 Romanian built TR-85-800 and 31 soviet T-72 \"Ural-1\" tanks. The 9th and the 11th Mechanized Divisions operated Romanian built TR-77-580 tanks, the 2nd Mechanized Division and the 57th Tank Division operated Romanian built TR-85-800 tanks, the 10th and 81st Mechanized Divisions and the 6th Tank Division operated soviet and Czechoslovak built T-55/-55A/-55AM tanks, while the remaining three mechanized divisions (1st, 18th and 67th) were equipped with mixed equipment, including a number of outdated soviet T-34-85 tanks, within their mechanized regiments. The 1st Mechanized Tudor Vladimirescu Division apparently operated four types of tanks, from the modern soviet T-72 \"Ural-1\", a number of Romanian TR-77-580 and soviet T-55A tanks, to the outdated T-34-85 tanks.\n\nThe predominantly defensive structure of the Romanian Land Forces was also highlighted by the five anti-tank (missile-artillery) regiments (each with 36 Romanian made 100 mm anti-tank gun M1977 and 12 ATGM launcher vehicle based on BRDM-2 4x4 scout armoured car a.k.a. 9P133 \"Malyutka\" (with 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank guided missiles) and 9P148 \"Konkurs\" (with 9M113 Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles), placed especially in the areas most exposed to a possible armored attack, and subordinated to the four army commands. Besides these, there were also nine anti-tank artillery battalions, mostly subordinated to the mechanized divisions, some equipped with Romanian made 100 mm anti-tank gun M1977, but the majority with older Soviet production 85 mm antitank gun D-48. \nSurface-to-surface missile battalions were divided into four batteries, each equipped with one missile launcher. The RLF operated 32 9K52 Luna-M short-range artillery rocket systems and 18 R-17 Elbrus tactical ballistic missile systems. Each mechanized division had a \"Luna-M\" missile battalion, while two of the four army commands had also an \"Elbrus\" missile brigade. Proven to be fairly inaccurate in combat, \"Luna-M\" (a.k.a. FROG-7) and \"Elbrus\" (a.k.a. SCUD-B) missiles would be rather less effective weapons carrying conventional high-explosive warheads. Tipped with nuclear or chemical warheads, however, they could be devastating. According to one former Romanian official writing in 1988, Romania produced chemical agents that could be delivered by battlefield missiles. The vânători de munte specialised troops, reactivated in 1961, were formed up into an independent branch of the RLF with 4 separate mountain brigades in 1989. The vânători de munte were seen as the best-trained forces of the Army in the communist Romania. Each brigade had a mechanized company equipped with MLVM APCs and a battalion of 76mm. mountain guns Md.1982 (similar to yugoslav 76 mm mountain gun M48), but most of the equipment was for a motorized light infantry unit.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, some major units were disbanded and a lot of equipment was phased out or scrapped due to a severe shortage of funds. The whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps, and from regiments into battalions. In the mid-1990s, the situation of the land forces was critical: the military budget was three times lower than in 1989 (636 million dollars), 50% of the equipment was older than 30 years, and 60% of the armoured vehicles and 85% of the missile units were non-operational. Due to lack of fuel and training, the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low (only about 30% of the entire land forces were operational). However, after 1996 the government took serious action; the military budget was increased greatly, and modernisation of equipment commenced. Officially, the program to modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 April 2000.\n\nIn 2005, the army comprised eight combat, four combat support, and two logistic brigades, while ten combat, five combat support and two logistic brigades were further mobilised in case of crisis. Many of these units have been reorganized as part of the \"2007 Force Plan\".\n\nCurrently, about 75,000 military personnel and 15,000 civilians comprise the armed forces, for a total of 90,000 men and women. Out of the 75,000 military personnel, about 43,000 are in the Land Forces.\nThe Romanian Land Forces are undergoing a three-stage modernisation. In 2007, the first short-term stage was completed (reorganisation of the command structure and implementation of the voluntary military service). 2015 marked the end of the second stage (operational integration in both NATO and the EU). 2025 is the set date for when the long-term stage is to be completed (full technical integration in NATO and the EU). The stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces, reducing the number of personnel, as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with NATO standards.\n\nRomania abolished compulsory military service on October 23, 2006. This came about due to a 2003 constitutional amendment which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The Romanian Parliament voted to abolish conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalising one of many military modernisation and reform programmes that Romania agreed to when it joined NATO in March 2004.\n\nIn peacetime, the supreme commander of the Land Forces is the minister of defense, while in wartime, the president assumes the role of supreme commander. The main combat formations of Romania are the 2nd Infantry Division \"Getica\", and the 4th Infantry Division \"Gemina\". Until 2015, the Romanian Land Forces fielded a third division, namely the 1st Division \"Dacia\". Before June 2008, the 1st and 4th divisions were known as the 1st Territorial Army Corps and the 4th Territorial Army Corps, and in turn they used to be known as the \"1st Army\" and \"4th Army\" prior to 2000. However, due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility with NATO standards, they were renamed and reorganized as divisions. In 2010, the Joint HQ command was renamed as the 2nd Infantry Division \"Getica\" and received units from the 1st and 4th Infantry divisions.\n\nThe current chief of the Romanian Land Forces Staff is Major General Nicolae Ciucă, who succeeded Major General Mircea Savu on 7 January 2014. The official day of the Land Forces is celebrated each year, on 23 April.\n\nThe Romanian Land Forces have completely overhauled their equipment in the past few years, replacing them with more modern equipment.\nThe TR-85M1 \"Bizon\" main battle tank and the MLI-84M \"Jder\" infantry fighting vehicle are the most modern, domestically produced equipment of the Romanian Land Forces. Also, 43 ex-German Gepard anti-aircraft systems were commissioned in late 2004.\n\nThe Land Forces ordered about 100 US Army Humvees; the first eight were delivered to the military police in December 2006. 31 Piranha III armoured vehicles (LAV III variant) and 60 URO VAMTAC high mobility vehicles were also ordered in 2007 for deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. The land forces are also purchasing additional Piranha III armored vehicles as well as planning on replacing its aging TAB armoured personnel carriers with a new vehicle that will be designed and produced in conjunction with the Germany company Rheinmetall.\n\nEquipment Summary (2017):\n\nThe evolution of the special forces within the Romanian Land Forces led to the establishment of the 1st Special Operations Regiment on 1 August 2009, headquartered at Târgu Mureş. It later became the 6th Special Operations Brigade on 25 October 2011, composed of a special operations battalion, two paratrooper battalions and a logistic battalion.\n\nThe most famous and well trained unit is the 1st Special Operations Battalion \"\"Vulturii\"\", which was legally created in late 2005, after several batches of graduates had already been selected. Members of the special forces battalion have benefitted from courses abroad, such as the US Army Special Forces (Green Berets) course, the United States Marine Corps Force Recon course, as well as other courses. The Special Forces battalion became fully operational during 2007, after a company had already been commissioned in early 2006.\n\nThe current Romanian reconnaissance battalions (the 313th, the 317th and the 528th) are also considered special forces units, and were formed in the 1960s during the communist regime. After the revolution, the units suffered from a lack of funds which resulted in the temporary disbandment of the 313th Battalion. However, their equipment was completely overhauled in the past few years and the combat readiness and capabilities have regained full strength.\n\nDIR, Rapid Intervention Squad of the Romanian Ministry of Defense is an elite special operations unit currently belonging to the Romanian Military Police. It is a special unit inside the military, formed of highly skilled individuals, a very large percentage of its members being champions in martial arts, kickboxing, athletic disciplines and so on. DIR was, until December 2003, top secret.\n\nThe following troops are deployed abroad:\n\nAfter the Romanian Revolution, many firing ranges and training areas were closed and abandoned due to lack of funds. Currently, the military schools and training units of the Romanian Land Forces are directly subordinated to the central headquarters. There are 5 military high schools (Câmpulung Moldovenesc, Alba Iulia, Craiova, Breaza and Constanța), five military academies, one officer school (Piteşti), 3 training schools (Sibiu, Piteşti, Buzău) and 9 training battalions.\n\nIn the past few years, many training exercises have taken place in Romania with other Balkan or Allied countries. Most of these exercises took place at Babadag, which is one of the largest and most modern training firing ranges and military facilities in Europe, with a total surface area of 270 square kilometres. It was announced on December 6, 2006 that 1,500 U.S. troops stationed at Mihail Kogălniceanu, which in time will form Joint Task Force East, will be using Babadag as a training base.\n\nThe Romanian Land Forces distinguishes four career paths: officers (\"Ofiţeri\"), warrant officers (\"Maiştrii militari\"), NCO's (\"Subofiţeri\") and enlisted men (\"Soldaţi şi gradaţi voluntari\"). The Marshal rank can be given only in wartime by the President of Romania; in fact, Romania had only three marshals coming from the officers` rank in its history: Ion Antonescu, Alexandru Averescu and Constantin Prezan. Kings Ferdinand I, Carol II and Mihai I also held the rank of Marshal of Romania. King Carol I held simultaneous ranks as Russian Marshal and German Field-marshal.\n\n\n"}

It was fashionable throughout the 19th century. Its body provides seats for four passengers, two back-seat passengers vis-à-vis two behind the coachman's high box-seat. A leather roof can be raised to give back-seat passengers some protection from the weather.\n\n\"Barouche\" is an anglicisation of the German word \"barutsche\", via the Italian \"baroccio\" or \"biroccio\" and ultimately from the ancient Roman Empire's Latin \"birotus\", \"two-wheeled\". The name thus became a misnomer, as the later form of the carriage had four wheels.\n\nThe barouche was based on an earlier style of carriage, the \"calash\" or \"calèche\": this was a light carriage with small wheels, inside seats for four passengers, a separate driver's seat and a folding top. A folding calash top was a feature of two other types: the chaise, a two-wheeled carriage for one or two persons, a body hung on leather straps or thorough-braces, usually drawn by one horse; and a victoria, a low four-wheeled pleasure carriage for two with a raised seat in front for the driver. A victoria is distinguished from a barouche by having fold-down occasional seating for the rear-facing passengers, instead of permanent front seats.\n\nIn Quebec, Canada, \"calèche\" refers to a two-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle with or without a folding top and with a driver's seat on the splashboard.\n\nIn the Philippines, the \"kalesa\" is a one-horse descendant of Spanish Colonial calashes, and is a common sight in older cities such as Manila and Vigan.\n\nA barouche was an expensive four-wheeled, shallow vehicle used in the 19th century with two double seats inside, arranged \"vis-à-vis\", so that the sitters on the front seat face those on the back seat. It has a soft collapsible half-hood folding like a bellows over the back seat and a high outside box seat in front for the driver. The entire carriage is suspended on C springs and leather straps and more recently additional elliptical springs.\nIt is drawn by a pair of horses and was used in the 19th century for display and summer leisure driving. Designed to give a powerful impression of luxury and elegance, the structure of the carriage is heavier than it looks because of the lack of a rigid roof structure.\n\nA light barouche was a \"barouchet\" or \"barouchette\". A barouche-sociable was described as a cross between a barouche and a victoria. \n\nA barouche-landau is mentioned in \"Emma\", published in 1816 by Jane Austen. It \"combines the best features of a barouche and a landau\". An illustration of the expensive and more rarely seen vehicle, on account of the expense, is shown in a paper by Ed Ratcliffe, citing editor R. W. Chapman's collection of the works of Jane Austen, in the volume Minor Works, as noted in Ratcliffe's sources.\nf\n\nIn the 1994 novel, \"The Alienist\", which is set in 1896, by Caleb Carr a frequently used mode of transportation for the characters is a caleche.\n\nIn the novels by Jane Austen, \"Lady Dalrymple, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, and Henry Crawford owned barouches\" in which other characters rode, and Jane Austen herself on at least one occasion in 1813 rode in a barouche. Henry Crawford was a character in \"Mansfield Park\" and his barouche was the topic of two important scenes of the novel; Lady Dalrymple was in \"Persuasion\", while Mr and Mrs Palmer were characters in \"Sense and Sensibility\".\n\nBarouche driving is mentioned as a fashionable pastime in Nice, Italy, in chapter 37 of \"Little Women\" by Louisa May Alcott.\n\nChichikov, the main character of Nikolai Gogol's \"Dead Souls\", is frequently driven around in his own barouche by his servant Selifan and is also involved in a crash with another carriage.\n\n"}

The FDA can require a pharmaceutical company to place a boxed warning on the labeling of a prescription drug, or in literature describing it. It is the strongest warning that the FDA requires, and signifies that medical studies indicate that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or even life-threatening adverse effects.\nEconomists and physicians have thoroughly studied the effects of FDA boxed warnings on prescription patterns. It is not necessarily true that a physician and patient will have a conversation about a drug's boxed warning after it is issued. For instance, an FDA-mandated boxed warning decreased rosiglitazone use by 70%, but that still meant 3.8 million people were given the drug. Later research indicated that after receiving an FDA advisory, there was a decrease in rosiglitazone use, due to a combined effect of media exposure, advisory, and scientific publications, whereas pioglitazone (with a similar advisory but less media exposure) did not similarly decrease in use. This challenges the idea that physicians and patients will have a conversation after a boxed warning is issued. Throughout the country, boxed warnings will be translated into prescription patterns differently by different physicians.\n\nIn 2005, the FDA issued a boxed warning regarding the risk of atypical antipsychotics being prescribed among elderly patients with dementia. This advisory was associated with a decrease in use of antipsychotics, especially in elderly patients with dementia.\n\nBoxed warnings on drugs have received increased media attention in the United States since 2004.

Risher received his B.A. in Music at the University of Central Florida and his M.M. in music composition from Florida State University. While living in Tallahassee, Florida, Risher was a member of the new music ensembles Paragaté and Tallahassee Camerata.\n\nRisher's output is typically tonal, with primary influences being minimal music, American and Brazilian popular musics, early music, and American shape note hymnody. Most works feature the use of conventional harmony, with great clarity of individual melodic lines. Risher's works transcend the superficiality of much popular music, however, in their frequent use of complex canonic and polyphonic structures and additive rhythms.\n\nRisher composes prolifically for ensembles ranging from concert band to Chinese traditional instrumental ensemble. He has also composed works for electronic media and incidental music for theatrical works. His most significant output, however, comprises works for brass instruments (a preference likely shaped by his experience as a trombonist) and for early (Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque) instrument ensembles.\n\nRisher's works for early instruments have been commissioned by a number of major ensembles, including Palladian Ensemble, Baroque Northwest, Tintagel, and Trio Dolce. Although his works for early instruments are clearly composed from a twentieth (or twenty-first) century point of reference, Risher's writing for such instruments is surprisingly idiomatic, showing his great familiarity with early instruments and genres. Among Risher's favorite forms for such works are the ground bass and chaconne.\n\nHis music has been released on the Index, PhonoStatic, and Discus record labels and his scores are published by Wehr's Music House.\n\nRisher lived in Hamburg, Germany between the years of 1995 and 2005, and now lives in North Carolina.\n\nHe is a member of the electronic group \"Paragaté\", and has released a set of CDs on the Camerata label.\n\n\n\n"}

Sir Thomas West (d.1386) had fought in the Battle of Crécy and the subsequent siege of Calais under the command of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The younger Thomas almost certainly served alongside his father under King Richard II; one of them was in active service in Calais in 1386, the year of his father's death. A knight banneret, he served in Ireland with the Duke of Aumale in 1399, and attended Richard's young Queen Isabella of Valois homeward to Calais in 1401.\n\nWhen West was seventeen, he and his mother and sister Eleanor were assaulted and robbed, by Nicholas Clifton, who carried his sister off; he was probably the same Nicholas Clifton who later married her.\n\nWest was knighted in 1399, and summoned to Parliament as Baron West in 1402, by which time he held the manor of Harby, Nottinghamshire. He inherited the manor of Newton Tony, Wiltshire, from his father, and the manors of Midsomer Norton, Somerset, and Hinton Martell, Dorset, from his mother.

The story constitutes Jamie McCrimmon's first journey with the Doctor as a travelling companion. Only two of the four episodes are held in the BBC archives; two remain missing. Episode 2 is the earliest surviving episode to feature both Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor and Frazer Hines as companion Jamie McCrimmon.\n\nThe Second Doctor and his companions, Polly, Ben and Jamie, are captured when they arrive on a deserted volcanic island by the survivors of Atlantis. Their high priest, Lolem, decides to sacrifice them to the great god Amdo. The Doctor is given a meal, and realises that it must have been prepared by Professor Zaroff, a missing scientist who was presumed dead. The Doctor sends Zaroff a note, which results in them being saved just in time by Zaroff, a renegade scientist from the surface world who has devised the technology the Atlanteans use to refine their food. Zaroff plans to raise Atlantis from the sea and aims to do it with the help of the Doctor and his companions. Polly is taken by Damon for conversion-surgery into a Fish Person, while Ben and Jamie are taken to work in a mine.\n\nWhen the Doctor finds out Zaroff's plans for Polly, he cuts off the power, which gives her time to escape from Damon with the help of a servant girl named Ara. Zaroff tells the Doctor that he plans to drain the sea so Atlantis could come back to the surface. The Doctor immediately realises this will destroy Earth and escapes to find a solution and look for his companions. Meanwhile, in the mine, Ben and Jamie leave with two shipwrecked sailors, Sean and Jacko, in search of an escape route. This leads them to Polly's hiding place, the temple of Amdo. The Doctor finds a priest named Ramo along the way and tells him Zaroff's plans. Ramo takes the Doctor to Thous, King of Atlantis, to convince him of the danger they're in. Thous does not believe the Doctor, and takes Zaroff's side.\n\nThe Doctor and the priest are taken to be sacrificed to Lolem at the temple of Amdo. They are then saved by Ben faking the voice of the statue of Amdo and giving them a chance to escape. Although this convinces Lolem, Zaroff remains suspicious and is determined to find them. The Doctor decides to cause a revolution and comes up with a plan to kidnap Zaroff and convince the Fish People to create a food-shortage. This succeeds with the help of the Doctor's companions, Sean and Jacko, and the priest Ramo. They take Zaroff to the temple of Amdo where Ramo and Polly are left as his guards. Zaroff then fakes a seizure, stabs Ramo, and takes Polly as a hostage. Ramo survives and goes to warn the Doctor, which gives Jamie, Sean, and Jacko the chance to rescue Polly. Zaroff is able to escape and goes straight to Thous. Thous begins to worry about the strike amongst the Fish People and realises Zaroff is mad. He immediately orders him to stop his plans, but this angers Zaroff, who shoots Thous and his royal protectors.\n\nWith Zaroff out of sight, the Doctor finds Thous bleeding but alive and takes him to the temple of Amdo for safety. He plans to stop Zaroff by sinking Atlantis even further so the reactor and Zaroff's laboratory could be destroyed. The Doctor and Ben cause a radiation leak to put their plan in action while Sean and Jacko warn the Atlanteans to get to higher level. The walls of Atlantis start to crumble but Polly and Jamie are able to find a way out to the surface. When the Doctor and Ben find Zaroff, he is determined to not let anything stop him, even the flooding. They are able to trick Zaroff and lock him out of his laboratory just in time but he won't give up which results in his death by drowning. The Doctor and Ben make their way towards the surface where they reunite with Jamie and Polly. Knowing many will have survived the crisis, the Doctor and his companions flee in the TARDIS.\n\n Episode is missing\n\nWorking titles for this story include \"Under the Sea\", \"Atlanta\" and \"The Fish People\". The history of this script is particularly troubled. After its commission, it was dropped from the production schedule, partly because of concerns that it would require a higher budget than was available. A new script by William Emms, \"The Imps\", was commissioned to replace it; Emms, however, subsequently fell ill. When it was realised that it was unlikely that he would be able to complete changes to the script, which was due to begin shooting in a month, the original script, now titled \"The Underwater Menace\", was brought back into the schedule. A further complication arose because Frazer Hines was brought on as a regular member of the cast barely a month before the serial was due to start production, and his character, Jamie, had to be worked into the script. Because of all of these problems, the individual episodes were recorded just a week before they were due to be broadcast. Recordings took place at Riverside studios in Hammersmith.\n\nIn December 2011, the BBC announced that Episode 2, previously missing, had been discovered among material bought by former TV engineer Terry Burnett with only cuts from Australian censors missing. The missing frames are still held by the National Archives of Australia, and, once re-incorporated, made the episode complete for the first time since the master tape was wiped in July 1969.\n\nActor Patrick Troughton was reputedly particularly unhappy about the production. He is reported to have described the show as having \"ridiculous costumes and make-up of the fish people\". Producer Innes Lloyd appeared to concur, admitting \"it did look like something from a '50s American 'B' movie\".\n\nColin Jeavons later appeared in the \"Doctor Who\" spin-off pilot \"K-9 and Company\". Noel Johnson later played Sir Charles Grover in \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" (1974). Peter Stephens had previously appeared in \"The Celestial Toymaker\" (1966).\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Nigel Robinson, was published by Target Books in February 1988.\n\nAs with all missing episodes, off-air recordings of the soundtrack exist due to contemporary fan efforts. In February 2005, these were released on CD, accompanied by linking narration from Anneke Wills. Episode three was released on VHS in 1998, along with the documentary \"The Missing Years\". They were later included on the \"Lost in Time\" DVD set; several brief surviving film clips were also included.\n\nEpisode 2, which was found in December 2011, was initially prepared for release on DVD in 2014. After an extended period of uncertainty, the BBC confirmed a release date of 26 October 2015. The two surviving episodes are supplemented by reconstructions of the missing two episodes, using restored audio and stills from the production.\n\n\"Doctor Who: The Television Companion\"s David Howe and Stephen Walker were unimpressed by the story, stating that despite reasonable dialogue, effective sets and effects it was otherwise \"very difficult to find anything good to say about this story, which is undoubtedly the weakest of the second Doctor's era, if not of the sixties as a whole\".\n\n\"Starburst\"s Paul Mount said the serial was \"tacky, cheap and unsubtle\" but partially redeemed by \"a sterling performance from Patrick Troughton, rising way above often lamentable material\".\n\n\"CultBox\"s Ian McArdell received the story more positively praising Troughton's \"wonderfully charismatic\" performance and Joseph Furst's \"genuinely scary\" Zaroff. He did note however that the Fish People's costumes were \"frankly bizarre\" and \"their floating ballet sequence from Episode 3, though ambitious, fails to achieve\".\n\n\"Den of Geek\"s Andrew Blair selected \"The Underwater Menace\" as one of the ten \"Doctor Who\" stories that would make great musicals.\n\n\n"}

Arnold, is an American soul singer who enjoyed considerable success in the United Kingdom from the 1960s onwards.\n\nArnold was born into a family of gospel singers, and performed as a vocal soloist for the first time when she was four years old. Her family lived in the African-American Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nShe married early and had two children, Kevin and Debbie. Arnold worked two jobs, one in an office and the other in food manufacturing, until 1965, when Maxine Smith, an ex-girlfriend of her brother, contacted her with an offer. Maxine and her friend Gloria Scott had managed to arrange an audition for three girls to replace the original Ikettes, the dancer/singer troupe that provided vocal and dance accompaniment for the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Smith contacted Arnold, whom she knew to be a singer. At the audition the three young women were offered the job on the spot, but Smith persuaded Arnold to attend a concert in Fresno that night before making a final decision. When she arrived home at 6:00 the next morning, Arnold's furious husband hit her. She left him immediately, and after placing her children in the care of her parents, joined the Ike & Tina Turner Revue.\n\nAs an Ikette, Arnold sang lead on the 1966 single \"What'cha Gonna Do (When I Leave You),\" backed by Brenda Holloway and Patrice Holloway for Phil Spector's Phi-Dan Records. Arnold sang backing vocals on the Ike Turner produced side of the album \"River Deep – Mountain High\". She also appeared in the 1966 concert film, \"The Big T.N.T Show\". Arnold quit the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in the fall of 1966 after their tour with the Rolling Stones in the UK. She remained in London to establish a solo career, with the encouragement of Mick Jagger. Arnold noted the difference between how she had been treated in America and how she was received in England, saying, \"A young black woman on her own in America in a white environment would not have been treated as well as I was in England.\" Her friendship with Jagger helped her land a solo contract with Immediate Records, a label founded by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham.\n\nArnold enjoyed several major British hits on Immediate Records, including songs written for her by Paul Korda, who wrote \"The Time Has Come\". She also recorded songs written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane from labelmates Small Faces, who also backed her on several recordings; Arnold had a brief romantic liaison with Marriott in 1967. She toured with the Small Faces during 1967-68, made several TV appearances with them, and featured as backing vocalist on two of their biggest hits, \"Itchycoo Park\" and \"Tin Soldier\". Other credits in this period include her duet with Rod Stewart on the single \"Come Home Baby\" (produced by Mick Jagger on Immediate Records, with Ron Wood on guitar, Keith Richards on bass, Nicky Hopkins on electric piano, Keith Emerson on Hammond organ and the Georgie Fame Brass Section), as well as Chris Farlowe's version of the Motown standard \"Reach Out (I'll Be There)\" (with Albert Lee on guitar and Carl Palmer on drums).\n\nHer first backing band, the Blue Jays, had been inherited from American soul singer Ronnie Jones and included former Bluesbreakers guitarist Roger Dean. This was followed by the Nice, whose line-up was Keith Emerson on organ, who had just quit the VIPs (later to be known as Spooky Tooth), David O'List on guitar, Lee Jackson on bass and Ian Hague on drums. During this period she scored several hits, including the original version of Cat Stevens' song \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" and \"Angel of the Morning\", plus the Marriott-Lane song \"(If You Think You're) Groovy\".\n\nAfter the collapse of Immediate Records in the late 1960s, Arnold signed a production contract with the Robert Stigwood Organisation and released two singles on the Polydor label, produced by Barry Gibb, but a planned album with Gibb was never completed. Between 1969 and 1970, she recorded eleven songs which were produced by Gibb himself but only two of the songs \"Bury Me Down By the River\" and \"Give a Hand, Take a Hand\" were released. In February 1970, she sang harmony vocals on the song \"Born\" which was included on Gibb's debut solo album \"The Kid's No Good\".\n\nIn 1970 Arnold moved to the musical stage, appearing alongside P.J. Proby in the rock musical \"Catch My Soul\". She then formed a new backing band that included the future members of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, plus Steve Howe, who would soon join Yes. During this period she renewed her association with Steve Marriott, recording and touring with his new band Humble Pie (\"Rock On\"), as well as contributing session musician backing vocals for many notable UK and US recordings including the original 1970 album recording of the rock musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", Nick Drake's \"Poor Boy\", and recordings by Dr. John, Graham Nash, Gary Wright, Manassas, Nektar, Jimmy Witherspoon, Nils Lofgren and Eric Burdon. She toured with Eric Clapton, who also produced a number of unreleased sessions with her; during these sessions she met American bassist Fuzzy Samuels of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and they subsequently became involved romantically and had a son, Kodzo. In 1974 she sang on Freddie King's album \"Burglar\". Feeling out of place in the rapidly changing British music scene of the mid-1970s, Arnold and Samuels returned to her hometown of Los Angeles. While they were living there, Arnold's relationship with Samuels ended; just two weeks after the split, her daughter Debbie was killed in a car accident. After her daughter's death, Arnold withdrew from public life for some time, not re-emerging until 1978. At this time she was reunited with Barry Gibb, who wanted to complete the never-finished solo album for her. In the event, Arnold was able to release these recordings only in 2017, on her album \"The Turning Tide\".\n\nArnold moved to Hollywood in 1981, but returned to England the following year to raise her younger son there. She began working with leading British reggae band Steel Pulse and returned to the charts in both the UK and Australia on the hit 1983 cover version of the Staple Singers \"Respect Yourself\", recorded with British electropop group Kane Gang, which reached #21 in Britain and #19 in Australia.\n\nIn 1984, she returned to the stage in the cast of the musical \"Starlight Express\" as Belle the Sleeping Car, after which she worked with a number of noted British acts including Boy George as well as working on several film soundtracks. Weeks before beginning a tour with Billy Ocean, her legs were badly injured in a car accident. She went ahead with the Ocean tour, at first appearing on crutches, but her injuries eventually forced her to leave the tour after ten weeks. Without a record contract and unable to play live, Arnold survived by doing sessions for advertising jingles. In 1986 she returned to the rock scene, featuring prominently as a backing vocalist on Peter Gabriel's worldwide hit \"Sledgehammer\". This was followed by a successful collaboration with The Beatmasters on the retro-styled Acid House hit \"Burn It Up\", which reached #14 in Britain in October 1988, and became her third hit to spend 10 weeks or more on the UK Singles Chart. \"Burn It Up\" was included on the Beatmasters' album \"Anywayawanna\". During the late 1980s and 1990s Arnold resumed an active career as a session vocalist, and her credits in this period included The KLF (\"What Time Is Love?\", \"3 A.M Eternal\"), Nina Hagen, Roger Waters (\"Amused to Death\"), and Graham Parker. In 1989 she reunited with her old friend Steve Marriott to record his solo album \"30 Seconds to Midnite\", which proved to be their final collaboration; Marriott died in a house fire in 1991. She then later worked with the UK Hardcore group Altern 8 on their single “E-Vapor-8” in 1992.\n\nIn 1994, she joined the cast of the award-winning musical \"Once on This Island\" as Erzulie, beautiful Goddess of Love. While the production was playing in Birmingham she met leading UK band Ocean Colour Scene, one of the new wave of latter-day mod groups who (like their mentor Paul Weller), idolised the Small Faces. In 1995 Arnold joined forces with Primal Scream to record a blistering cover version of the Small Faces' song \"Understanding\", the opening track of the various artists Small Faces tribute album \"Long Agos and Worlds Apart\". Following her earlier meeting with Ocean Colour Scene with whom Arnold would eventually form a close friendship she appeared on their 1997 album \"Marchin Already\" which reached Number 1 in the UK album charts lending backing vocals to single \"Travellers Tune\" and duet lead vocals alongside Simon Fowler on 1998 single \"It's a Beautiful Thing\".\n\nArnold joined forces with Chaz Jankel, former pianist with Ian Dury and the Blockheads. This was followed by an invitation to tour widely with Roger Waters. She was a backup vocalist on his 1999–2002 tour \"In the Flesh\" (also on the CD and DVD of the same name), as well as the 2006–2008 tour, \"Dark Side of the Moon Live\". Her version of \"The First Cut is the Deepest\" was featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 movie \"Seven Psychopaths\".\n\nIn 2001 Arnold released her full Immediate Records discography on the album \"The First Cut (The Immediate Anthology)\". It includes her famous albums \"The First Lady of Immediate\" and \"Kafunta\" in addition to several singles. A chance encounter at a party led to Blow Monkeys frontman Dr Robert on their 2007 album \"Five in the Afternoon\". In 2009 she toured the UK with Geno Washington and Jimmy James on the Flying Music 'This Is Soul Tour' and has since toured around the UK in her own. In 2012 she toured the UK with Maddy Prior, Jerry Donahue, Dave Swarbrick, and Thea Gilmore. In 2013 Arnold participated in the project \"The Band of Sisters\" with David Mindel, a British songwriter, jingle writer and composer of music for film and television. It brought together Arnold, Mim Grey, Tessa Niles, Lynda Hayes, Stevie Lange and Mandy Bell on the album called \"Issues\". In 2015 Arnold embarked on her first solo tour in Cape Town, South Africa. Arnold was then featured in the \"Small Faces\" musical \"All or Nothing\" at the Vault Theater Waterloo in which her love affair with Steve Marriott was documented.\n\nIn 2017 P. P. Arnold finally released her Heritage recordings in album. \"The Turning Tide\" is a collection of songs recorded between 1968 and 1970. Produced by Barry Gibb and Eric Clapton, the album was aborted and remained unfinished until 2017. In 2017 she celebrated her 50th Anniversary in the music industry with a fall tour that coincided with the release of \"The Turning Tide\". She also sang backing vocals alongside Madeline Bell, for the first track \"Woo Sé Mama\" on Paul Weller's album \"A Kind Revolution\" released May 2017. \n\nIn 2018 Arnold went on two tours in Australia: in May she went on first ever solo tour of Australia and New Zealand backed by Tim Rogers, the front man for the rock band You Am I, and Davey Lane and Rusty Hopkinson, also members of the band; in November she returned to Australia for the second tour, The Return of PP Arnold,where she performed with You Am I once again with James Black & The Wolfgramm Sisters. she also was a special guest on the RocKwiz Tour 2019, where she performed with Rockwiz Orchestra.\n\nIn August 2019, Arnold released her fourth solo album \"The New Adventures Of... P.P. Arnold\". The album was recorded and produced by life-long P.P. enthusiast, OCS star and Paul Weller band guitarist Steve Cradock at his Kundalini Studio in Devon, and follows on—after a 51-year gap – from the singer's first two solo albums on Immediate Records, \"The First Lady of Immediate\" and \"Kafunta\", as well as a more recent compilation of previously unreleased material from the late '60s and '70s, \"The Turning Tide\". The album spans from classic orchestral soul to house music, ending with a 10-minute reading of Bob Dylan's poem \"The Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie.\" Arnold explained: \"I've got this huge catalogue of records I've sung on, but I have only released two albums – and they've stood the test of time.\"\n\nIn October 2019, Arnold toured the UK to support the album.\n\nOn 8th May 2020, The Fratellis released their single 'Strangers In The Street' on which Arnold performed lead vocals. \n\nArnold was first married when she was a teenager. The marriage produced had two children Kevin and Debbie, but it was an abusive relationship. Her daughter Debbie died in the mid-1970s in a car accident. \n\nIn 1968, Arnold married her second husband Jim Morris at Guildford Town Hall in Surrey. Barry Gibb was the best man at their wedding. Morris worked for Robert Stigwood as a driver and assistant. Arnold met him through Kim Gardner. They divorced after two years, but remained friends.\n\nArnold has a son, Kodzo, from her relationship with musician Fuzzy Samuels. Kodzo is musical director for Jessie J and Jess Glynne. He is credited as a songwriter on Arnold's 2019 album, \"The New Adventures of... P.P. Arnold\" .\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2105788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105788", "title": "Blood Feud (The Simpsons)", "text": "Blood Feud (The Simpsons)\n\n\"Blood Feud\" is the twenty-second and final episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> second season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on July 11, 1991. In the episode, Mr. Burns falls ill and desperately needs a blood transfusion. Homer discovers Bart has Burns' rare blood type and urges him to donate, thinking the Simpsons will be handsomely rewarded. After receiving the blood transfusion, Burns sends them a card with no money. Marge convinces Homer not to send an insulting reply to his boss, but when Bart mails the letter anyway, Burns is livid. He later forgives Homer and sends the Simpsons a giant Olmec carving to show his gratitude.\n\nThe episode was written by George Meyer and directed by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion, and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.\n\n\"Blood Feud\" was part of the season two production run, but was completed behind schedule. It was originally broadcast on July 11, 1991, as part of \"premiere week\", the Fox Network's attempt to expand the typical 30-week prime time season and gain new viewers for the fall. In its original broadcast, the episode finished 24th in ratings for the week with a Nielsen rating of 10.8.\n\nMr. Burns falls ill with hypohemia — a fictional life-threatening condition in which the body fails to produce enough blood, though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia — and needs a blood transfusion. Searching for a donor, Burns finds none of the employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant share his rare blood type, double Onegative. Homer learns that Bart is double Onegative and urges him to donate blood, promising that Burns will reward the Simpsons handsomely. After Bart reluctantly agrees and his donation saves Burns' life, Burns sends the Simpsons a thank-you card. Enraged at the paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him not to send it. The next morning, Homer finds the letter missing and learns Bart has mailed it.\n\nWhen Homer fails to prevent the letter from reaching Burns' desk, his boss is furious and demands that he be beaten by thugs, but Smithers protests, insisting it is no way to return the favor the Simpsons performed for him. A remorseful Burns soon sends the family a colossal Olmec head of the god Xtapalapaquetl, which Bart likes. He also apologizes to Homer for misjudging him and gives him a copy of his book, \"Will There Ever Be A Rainbow?\".\n\nAs the Simpsons stare at the head, they debate the lesson they have learned from the affair. It cannot be \"a good deed is its own reward\" since Bart received a reward he likes. It also is not \"no good deed goes unrewarded\" because they would never have received anything had Homer not written the angry letter. Lisa suggests that perhaps there is no lesson. Homer observes that recent events are \"just a bunch of stuff that happened\", though everyone agrees the past few days have seen a memorable turn of events.\n\n\"Blood Feud\" was written by George Meyer and directed by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the idea for the episode while they were trying to fill up the rest of the production run. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion, and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. Harry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns and Smithers, could not attend the table read for the episode, so his parts were read by Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer). \"Blood Feud\" includes a first act that is much longer than a normal episode of the show. The producers were going to end the act with Mr. Burns feeling better, but decided to extend it to show how the Simpson family was affected. \"Blood Feud\" ends with the family discussing what the message of the episode was, but decide that there was no message. The writers were having trouble conceiving an ending, but decided that since there was no point, they would discuss it. In his book \"Planet Simpson\", Chris Turner writes that the ending is meant to openly mock the \"notion of the tidy sitcom-style moral\" and the \"formulaic plots of sitcoms\".\n\nDavid Silverman describes the episode as \"one of my very favorite episodes that I had the pleasure to direct\". He notes that several \"standard Homerisms\" appear for the first time in the episode, such as Homer's conversations with his brain and his high-pitched \"fairy voice\". Silverman inserted a red herring into the episode in a scene where Mr. Burns says that he was rejuvenated. Silverman used a close-up of Burns when he says \"blood of a young boy\" in hopes of misleading viewers into thinking that the rest of episode would be about Burns seeking more of Bart's blood.\n\nThe episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl. After the episode, it was moved into the Simpsons' basement, where it has since reappeared as a prop in the background of several episodes, although never in a major role. The design was partially based on real Olmec heads, but changed to look more interesting and grotesque.\n\nThe composition and setting of the scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns' health is partially inspired by a scene from \"Citizen Kane\" where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide. Otto is heard humming \"Iron Man\" by Black Sabbath. The ghostwriter Mr. Burns hires mentions that he wrote \"\"Like Hell I Can't\"\". The title is a play on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s autobiography \"Yes, I Can\". Homer mistells the story of \"Androcles and the Lion\", instead referring to it as \"Hercules and the Lion\". A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo's \"The Creation of Adam\". Burns's line about getting \"A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present\" is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books. The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns, and the scene where he and Bart attempt to get it out of the mailbox, are inspired by the \"Honeymooners\" episode \"Letter to the Boss\".\n\n\"Blood Feud\" was part of the season two production run, but was completed behind schedule. It was originally broadcast on July 11, 1991, as part of the Fox Network's \"premiere week\". Fox aired new episodes of several of its top shows, including \"The Simpsons\" and \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", in hopes of expanding the normal 30 week prime time season and gaining new viewers for the fall. Although \"Three Men and a Comic Book\" was the official season two finale, \"Blood Feud\" is considered part of the second season and was included in \"The Complete Second Season\" DVD boxset.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Blood Feud\" finished 24th in ratings for the week of July 8–14, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 10.8. It was the second highest rated program on Fox after \"Beverly Hills, 90210\". The episode beat a rerun of \"The Cosby Show\", which aired at the same time on NBC, which had a Nielsen Rating of 10.3. Fox finished second overall on July 11, with an average rating of 10.4.\n\nThe episode has received positive reviews from television critics. \n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, \"One of those shows that people always talk about when discussing The Simpsons – and rightfully so. Homer's transformation from angry parent to a sensible, calm husband is excellent, as is his reaction to Bart posting his angry letter. Their attempts to retrieve the letter and Burns' eventual reaction are fabulous.\" \n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: \"In many ways, 'Feud' seemed more derivative than usual. Not only did it resemble parts of 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish', but Homer's attempts to regain the letter before Burns reads it appears reminiscent of an episode of \"The Flintstones\". Despite those similarities, 'Feud' still provided a very entertaining show. The program packed in a slew of hilarious moments, from Homer's description of a Bible story to his visit to the post office.\" \n\nBen Rayner of \"The Toronto Star\" included \"Blood Feud\" in his list of the top ten episodes of \"The Simpsons\", noting that \"Homer's efforts to thwart the mail service still kill me 15 years later.\"\n\n"}

His grandfather, Felipe Pardo y Aliaga (1806-1868), was a distinguished diplomat, writer and politician who was also Foreign Minister and Vice President of the Peruvian Council of State before, during and after the presidencies of Vivanco and Castilla.\n\nJosé Pardo headed the Civilista Party and was Foreign Minister under Eduardo López de Romaña and then Prime Minister (1903-1904) under Manuel Candamo. After Candamo's death, Serapio Calderón became the interim president and called for new elections. The Civilista Party named José Pardo as its candidate, while the Democratic Party presented the candidacy of Nicolás de Piérola, who retired early before the elections mentioning a \"lack of guarantees.\" This fact led Pardo to become elected. Both his presidential terms were marked by liberal politics.\nHis government was marked by pushing for better education for all Peruvians. The elementary education in Peru, according to the Law of 1876 proposed by his father, Manuel Pardo, was under the responsibility of the municipalities throughout the country. José Pardo, under his Secretary of Justice and instruction, decided to confront the problem.\n\nThe law promulgated in 1905 reformed the education system to depend on the Central Government. It also called for primary education to be free and compulsory in far away places such as villages and mines, and that at least a small school for all children be located in any place with more than two hundred inhabitants. The \"Escuela Normal de Varones\" (\"Normal school for males\") was founded for the formation of male teachers, as well as the \"Escuela Normal de Mujeres\" (\"Normal school for females\").\n\nPardo created a General Branch of Instruction to where inspectors in charge of the work of surveillance in the whole Republic depended. In the cultural field the following were established: The National Academy of History, the School of Fine Arts (Bellas Artes), the National Academy of Music, and the National Museum of History. The superior combat school was also founded to form major state officers.\n\nDuring his second government José Pardo confronted the consequences of the First World War, as well as the labor agitation for the obtainment of the \"8 working hours\" a day. It was finally granted on January 15, 1919.\n\nWith barely a month before the end of his second term, he was ousted in a coup by Augusto B. Leguía. He spent the next eleven years in exile in the South of France, until his return to Lima. He died there in 1947.\n\nIn 1900, Pardo married his first cousin, Carmen Heeren Barreda. The marriage produced seven children: Manuel, José (the Marquis of Fuente Hermosa de Miranda, until his death in 1999), Enrique, Carmen, Juan, Oscar and Felipe. The current Marquis, José Pardo Paredes (born 1947), is one of President Jose Pardo's grandchildren.\n\n"}

He was also a member of the first group of muralists to receive commissions in Post-Revolutionary Mexico, working alongside such luminaries as José Clemente Orozco, Carlos Mérida, and Diego Rivera. Raised and educated amidst the social and political upheaval of the Mexican Revolution, Amero fully embraced its lessons and began to express his personal vision in painting, printmaking, illustration, photography, and filmmaking. In particular, Amero developed a great passion for lithography, establishing several print workshops during his career and influencing a generation of young artists. \n\nLike many leading Mexican artists of his time, Amero had an important relationship with the United States. In the late 1920s, he went via Cuba to New York City, where he worked as an illustrator for several publications, as well as the Saks Fifth Avenue department store. Most important of all to him were the lessons he received from George Miller, the master lithographer. \n\nIn 1930 he returned to Mexico City, where he established a successful lithography workshop at ENBA. Among those who attended his classes were such noteworthy artists as Bracho, Jean Charlot, Olga Costa, Gabriel Fernández Ledesma, Francisco Díaz de León, Francisco Dosamantes, Carlos Mérida, José Chávez Morado, Carlos Orozco Romero, and Alfredo Zalce.\n\nOn his return to New York a few years later he became a teacher at the Florence Cane School of Art, executed murals for the Works Progress Administration, and experimented with photography and filmmaking. He developed a friendship with the poet Federico García Lorca, who wrote a script for a Dada-esque Amero film entitled \"Viaje a la Luna (Trip to the Moon)\". He also had his first solo show at the Julien Levy Gallery and subsequently helped Henri Cartier-Bresson exhibit there. \n\nIn 1940 Amero moved to Seattle, Washington to teach at the Cornish School, which had attracted such innovators as Martha Graham and John Cage. In 1946, Amero took a professorship at the University of Oklahoma. There, he established a world-class print workshop and taught classes until his retirement in 1968.\n"}

He was orphaned by the age of eight and brought up by aunts and uncles. Joining the Scout movement at 11, he put on Scout shows as a patrol leader in the 2nd Denton and South Heighton Troop in Newhaven, Sussex.\n\nHis first job was as delivery boy for a relative's greengrocer's shop in Seaford. His employer took Reader to Brighton to buy supplies and then visit the Hippodrome theatre, where he saw many music hall stars of the day. At age 14 he became a telegram messenger and, at 15, an office boy at a cement works.\n\nIn 1920 he moved to the United States of America, working in various menial jobs, while acting in and directing off-Broadway shows. At 21 he choreographed his first Broadway show and the \"New York Times\" wrote: \"Watch Ralph Reader\". Returning to England, he produced and choreographed West End productions, notably variety performances at Drury Lane and at the Hippodrome.\n\nIn 1932, still in Scouting, he anonymously staged his first all-Scout variety show at the Scala Theatre, London. \"The Gang's All Here\" featured 150 Boy Scouts largely from London's East End, performing sketches, songs and dance numbers. The three performances were well received by public and critics. The following year \"The Gang Comes Back\" at the Scala played to capacity houses and the public and press began referring to \"The Gang Show\".\n\nIn 1934 that became its title and Reader acknowledged he was their producer. Besides the Gang Shows, in 1936, Reader wrote and directed a dramatic pageant called \"The Boy Scout\" with a cast of 1,500 Scouts at the Royal Albert Hall. In the same year, he wrote and played the lead in a feature film called \"The Gang Show\" which premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, London in April 1937. \n\nIn November 1937 \"a bunch of Boy Scouts\", as one writer described them, became the first amateurs to appear at a Royal Variety Performance. They shared billing with Gracie Fields, George Formby and Max Miller.\n\nThrough the prewar Gang Shows, Reader became friends with Air Commodore Archibald Boyle, the deputy director of RAF Intelligence. The German Ambassador, Joachim von Ribbentrop, attended the 1938 London Gang Show and invited Reader to visit the Hitler Youth Movement in Germany. Boyle persuaded Reader to become an Intelligence Officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve with the rank of Flight Lieutenant, although the diplomatic situation had deteriorated before he could take up von Ribbentrop's invitation. \n\nOn the outbreak of war, Boyle sent Reader to France for undercover work, in the guise of running a concert party, for which some former Gang Show members were recruited into the RAF. The show was entitled \"Ralph Reader and Ten Blokes from the Gang Show\" and, besides allowing Reader to complete intelligence tasks, had a positive effect on morale.\n\nOn returning to England, Reader was ordered to expand the Gang Shows, while his visits to RAF stations allowed Reader to monitor subversive propaganda which was a concern of the RAF high command. Reader eventually raised twenty-four RAF Gang Show units and two female WAAF units with a total establishment of nearly four hundred serving personnel. The RAF Gang Shows toured nearly every theatre of war, from Iceland to Burma.\n\nBy 1944, Gang Show units were estimated to have travelled 100,000 miles and entertained 3,500,000 servicemen. Some of those who served in the RAF Gang Shows would later become well known entertainers, such as Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Dick Emery and Cardew Robinson. For his services to the Royal Air Force he was awarded an MBE (Military Division) in 1943.\n\nAfter the war Reader set up his own production company, Ralph Reader Limited, which revived many shows he had produced before the war. The first postwar Gang Show ran for three weeks at the Blackpool Opera House and broke the theatre's records. He also began producing the London Gang Show in 1950, usually at the Golders Green Hippodrome in north London, and wrote more songs and musical plays for the Scout Association. He produced the Gang Show annually until 1974, and his association with it continued until his death.\n\nHe published an autobiography, \"It's Been Terrific\" in 1953, with a second volume, \"Ralph Reader Remembers\", in 1974. He was appointed Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957 \"for services to the Boy Scouts Association\". In the 1970s he was appointed to the post of Chief Scout's Commissioner, and in 1975 was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. He died in 1982, one week short of his 79th birthday.\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in November 1963 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.\n\nFollowing his death, the Ralph Reader Memorial Fund was established with contributions from friends, colleagues and members of various Gang Shows.

{"id": "2105828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105828", "title": "Smith's Food and Drug", "text": "Smith's Food and Drug\n\nSmith's Food and Drug, simply known as Smith's, is a supermarket chain that was founded in 1911 in Brigham City, Utah by Lorenzo Smith. Now a subsidiary of Kroger, it is a prominent regional supermarket chain operating in Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. After completing a merger with Portland-based Fred Meyer in 1997, Fred Meyer was in turn acquired by Cincinnati-based Kroger in 1998, automatically making Smith's a subsidiary of Kroger and making Kroger the largest supermarket chain in the United States. Smith's headquarters is in Salt Lake City.\n\nSmith's Food & Drug began in 1911 when Lorenzo Smith opened a small dry goods store in Brigham City, Utah. It was replaced with a larger store across the street in 1922 and renamed \"Smith & Son's Market\" in 1932. When his son Dee Glen Smith joined the business after serving in World War II, he began immediately expanding it.\n\nThe company's growth ramped up significantly from 1946 onward. It changed its name to Smith's Super Market in 1952. When Dee Smith took over as president upon his father's death in 1958, he discovered Brigham City was saturated, and felt the only option was to expand to other markets. Through partnerships and acquisitions, Dee Smith built the company until his death at age 58 in 1984. Later, Dee's son Jeff Smith became Chairman and CEO of Smith's. In 1989 the company completed its initial public offering and shares of the company started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nIn 1997, Smith's Food & Drug was acquired by Portland-based Fred Meyer or about $700 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) in stock. The deal created a supermarket and general merchandise chain with 374 stores in 17 western states. Under the terms of the agreement, Smith's shareholders received 1.05 shares of Fred Meyer common stock for each share of Smith's common stock, or about $45 a share. Fred Meyer also assumed $1.3 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in Smith's debt, which was accumulated largely from a recapitalization that was led by the Yucaipa Companies of Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1998, Fred Meyer was acquired by Kroger in a deal that would create a supermarket giant with $43 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in annual revenue and 2,200 stores in 31 states. As a result of the Kroger-Fred Meyer merger, Smith's had immediately become a subsidiary of Kroger and most Smith's Food & Drug Centers in Arizona were rebranded as Fry's Food and Drug. Kroger paid about $8 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in stock for Fred Meyer and assumed $4.8 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) of the company's debt, further consolidating the grocery business and creating the largest supermarket chain in the country. With the transaction, Kroger regained the spot it lost to Albertsons as the nation's largest supplier of eggs and milk. The acquisition gave Kroger the status of the nation's largest supermarket company, stretching from the fast-growing Western markets, where Portland-based Fred Meyer is strong, to the Midwest and the Southeast, where the Cincinnati-based company has many stores and much visibility. The move gave Kroger even greater purchasing power and substantial economies of scale.Among many of the products sold at Smith's are Kroger-branded. \n\nIn 2004, Kroger introduced a new store concept known as Marketplaces. In April 2004, Kroger merged Fred Meyer's Utah operations into Smith's. Five Utah Fred Meyer stores were converted to the new Smith's Marketplace banner in June of that year. The other Utah Fred Meyer stores located in Ogden, West Valley City, and Sandy were closed. Earlier, Fred Meyer had closed a full-service store located in Orem that failed to meet expectations. Smith's Marketplaces contain a full-line food and drug store, with a full assortment of general merchandise, Fred Meyer Jewelers, Starbucks, and bank branches. \n\nOn November 12, 2008, a new Smith's Marketplace store were opened in Lehi, Utah. The store is and includes the full array of departments such as grocery, apparel, home, etc. In 2008, Smith's also remodeled the former Fred Meyer store located at 500 East and 500 South in Salt Lake City. On July 16, 2014, Smith's opened a new Smith's Marketplace in Los Alamos, New Mexico. In November 2014, Smith's opened up its seventh marketplace store in North Ogden, Utah. On December 3, 2014, Smith's opened up its eighth store in West Jordan, Utah, located off 7800 South and the Mountain View Corridor. Smith's opened its ninth Marketplace store in Kaysville, Utah in late 2015. Another Marketplace was opened in South Jordan, Utah late 2016, as well as another in Springville, Utah in April 2017. On June 13, 2018, Smith's opened its first Marketplace in northwest Las Vegas.\nSmith's operates various fuel centers across the northwest and southwest regions of the United States. These fuel centers consist of fuel pumps and kiosks that sell convenient merchandises. Smith's also operates convenient shops known as Smith's Express that sell convenient merchandises and are accompanied with a fuel station. \n\nSmith's Food & Drug Centers offer a wide range of products from a wide range of brands. This includes Smith's banner products, Kroger banner products and products of Kroger private-label brands such as Simple Truth, Private Selection, Comforts, Abound, Luvsome, Bloom Haus, Murrary's Cheese, Bakery Fresh Goodness, Dip, Home Chef, Pet Pride, OfficeWorks, HD Designs, and Everyday Living.\n\nSmith's is among the supermarket chains in the United States that offer online services for grocery ordering. Smith's offers Pickup service where customers can order their groceries online via the Smith's website or mobile app available on the App Store and Google Play and pick them up at their select Smith's location. Smith's also has a partnership with online grocery delivery services Instacart and Shipt. \n\nJust like other Kroger-affiliated stores, Smith's offers a rewards program for both customers and associates where Rewards members can: buy certain items at certain sale prices, get discounts on certain items, earn fuel points that can allow Rewards members to save on fuel at Smith's or other Kroger-affiliated fuel centers, etc. Smith's Rewards can be used at other Kroger-affiliated stores. Smith's also offers a Mastercard credit card known as Smith's Rewards World Mastercard that is issued by U.S. Bank.\n\nSmith's has a current sponsorship with Primary Children's Hospital where Smith's provides donations to the hospital. Smith's also has sponsorships with sports organizations such as the Utah Jazz, Utah Utes, and Salt Lake Bees. \nIn early April 2019, Smith's Food & Drug had stopped accepting Visa credit cards. Smith's Food & Drug started to accept Visa credit cards again in late October 2019. \n\n"}
{"id": "2105832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105832", "title": "Morris Levy", "text": "Morris Levy\n\nMorris Levy (August 27, 1927 – May 21, 1990) was an American entrepreneur in the fields of jazz clubs, music publishing, and the independent record industry. He is known widely as the founder and owner of Roulette Records, the Birdland jazz club and the Roulette Room.\n\nAt the peak of his businesses, Levy owned more than 90 companies employing 900 people, including record-pressing plants, tape-duplicating plants, a distribution company, a prominent New England chain of 81 record stores (Strawberries), and numerous record labels.\n\nLevy, who went by \"Moishe\" or \"Mo\" within the record industry, was described by \"Billboard\" magazine as \"one of the record industry's most controversial and flamboyant players\" and by \"Variety\" as \"The Octopus\", for his far-reaching control, disproportionate to the size of his companies, in every area of the record business. AllMusic described him as \"a notorious crook who swindled artists out of their owed royalties.\" Levy was widely known for falsely taking writing credit in order to receive royalties—enriching himself at the expense of many of his signed artists, especially black R&B artists.\n\nLevy was convicted of extortion in 1990, on charges from an FBI investigation of the alleged infiltration of organized crime into the record business. Levy died after losing an appeal, two months before he was scheduled to report to prison.\n\nLevy was born a Sephardic Jew in Harlem, New York City. His father and older brother died of pneumonia when Levy was four months old. He quit school at the age of 13 and ran away to Florida, where he worked as a photographer in and around nightclubs. He later joined the United States Navy.\n\nHe later persuaded the owners of the nightclub where he worked to buy a club in New York, subsequently managing the club as the Cock Lounge. It became successful, attracting musicians such as Charlie Parker and Dexter Gordon, and allowed Levy to set up another club, Birdland, in 1949.\n\nAt Birdland, Levy was approached by a representative of ASCAP, seeking payment on behalf of songwriters for booking live music. He quickly appreciated the potential profits that could accrue from owning music copyrights. He then formed a publishing company, Patricia Music (named after his first wife), for which he acquired the rights to songs performed in his clubs. In 1956, he founded Roulette Records with George Goldner, initially to release rock and roll music but also diversifying into jazz. At one point he claimed the rights to the phrase \"rock and roll\" itself, which became widely employed after its use by his friend Alan Freed. Levy was known to add his name to the songwriting credits of many artists who recorded for his label.\n\nIn June 1975, Levy and Nathan McCalla \"(aka\" Big Nat; \"né\" Nathan Calven McCalla; 1929–1980), a vice president of Roulette Records, were indicted for assaulting an off-duty police officer, Charles Heinz, causing Heinz to lose an eye. The case was later dismissed, and all records were sealed. McCalla was subsequently murdered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Levy filed a much-publicized lawsuit against John Lennon for appropriating a line from the Chuck Berry song \"You Can't Catch Me\" (the publishing rights to which were owned by Levy) in the Beatles' song \"Come Together.\" Lennon ultimately settled with Levy by agreeing to record three songs from Levy's publishing catalogue during the sessions for his 1975 LP \"Rock 'n' Roll\", co-produced with Phil Spector. After complications due to Spector's erratic behavior, and after attempts at a second agreement failed, Levy used demo recordings by Lennon to produce and release a mail-order album entitled \"\". Levy successfully sued Lennon and was awarded $6,795, but he was countersued by Lennon, Capitol, EMI, and Apple Records, who won an award of $145,300.\n\nBeginning in 1984, the FBI targeted Levy in a 3½ year investigation into the alleged infiltration of organized crime into the record business. The case against Levy involved the extortion of John LaMonte, a record wholesaler in Darby, Pennsylvania. LaMonte had agreed to purchase records valued at $1.25 million from Levy in a 1984 deal, and when LaMonte subsequently refused to pay the full price, claiming that the best titles had been removed from the 60-truckload delivery, Levy reportedly arranged to extort the money from him. LaMonte was subsequently assaulted, receiving a fractured eye socket.\n\nLevy's arrest in September 1986 at the Boston Ritz Carlton Hotel was televised nationally. Earlier that year, near the end of the investigation, Levy sold Roulette Records and his publishing rights (reported variously, for $22–55 million).\n\nDuring its investigation, the FBI suspected that Levy had used the Roulette Room as a front for Vincent Gigante, allegedly the boss of the Genovese crime family and that Levy had had ties to organized crime for 20 years. Much of the trial evidence came from covertly recorded conversations taken from wiretaps and listening devices planted in the phones and business offices of Levy and Gaetano Vastola. Levy had a sign behind his desk that read, \"O Lord! Give me a Bastard with talent\" where the FBI had inserted a microphone inside the letter 'O' of \"Lord\". Two holes were also drilled in the ceiling for cameras \"(The Hit Men\", p. 34).\n\nLevy was convicted in December 1988 by a Federal jury in Camden, New Jersey, of two counts of conspiring to extort. Also convicted were Howard Fisher (Roulette's controller) and Dominick Canterino (a Caporegime in the Genovese crime family).\n\nLevy vehemently denied the charges. At his sentencing hearing, his attorneys cited his extensive philanthropic work, while FBI agents testified that Levy had also been a major supplier of heroin for a convicted Philadelphia drug dealer, Roland Bartlett. In 1988 Levy was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $200,000, subsequently appealing his conviction. Canterino was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Lamonte entered the federal witness protection program.\n\nDuring his appeal, Levy remained free on bail, which was secured with his upstate New York estate, Sunnyview Farm. In October 1989, shortly before his death, his conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia. Also in 1989, as the principal shareholder of BeckZack Corp., which owned all 81 of the Strawberries record stores, Levy sold the chain.\n\nIn January 1990, Levy unsuccessfully petitioned to have his sentence eliminated because of his failing health. Instead he was granted a 90-day stay and was scheduled to report to jail on July 16.\n\nHe died on May 20, 1990 in Ghent, New York of cancer, before he could report to jail.\n\nIn 1996, a court found Levy's estate posthumously liable for $4 million in a case initiated by Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant of the Teenagers, authors of the song \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\", who sued Levy for unpaid songwriting royalties. During the trial, the two testified they had received just $1,000 for the 1956 hit, which sold more than 3 million copies. Santiago testified that Levy told him, \"Don't come down here anymore or I'll have to kill you or hurt you.\"\n\nMusic companies, record companies and labels owned by Levy included the following:\n\nLevy lived in a Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan, New York City and at his 1,500-acre farm, Sunnyview Farm, seven miles east of the Hudson River in Columbia County, Ghent, New York. The property had been a dairy farm. Levy initially used it to raise cattle, hay, and corn, but later used it exclusively to breed race horses. Sunnyview Farm remained a horse-breeding farm. It was later the site of The Big Up Festival.\n\nLevy married five times. In a 1986 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", he stated, \"the only thing I know about organized crime is my five ex-wives.\" Josh Alan Friedman, the author of a 2008 exposé of the music industry, \"Tell the Truth Until They Bleed\", said that Levy had sent one of his wives to the hospital after beating her in a telephone booth.\n\nLevy's older brother, Zachariah (Irving) Levy (1923–1959), the manager of Birdland, was fatally stabbed there January 26, 1959 (after midnight January 25) while Urbie Green was performing. His body was discovered in the rear of the club, near the service area. The stabbing had apparently occurred unnoticed by patrons. Morris subsequently took over Irving's role in the club; and from 1959 through the early 1960s, the club enjoyed great success as one of the few remaining jazz clubs in the area. According to Frederic Dannen in his book \"Hit Men\", Irving had been stabbed for blocking a prostitute – and wife of an organized crime loan shark – from entering the club. In Levy's 1986 extortion trial, the FBI said that Levy's brother was killed mistakenly by organized-crime figures attempting to kill Morris Levy.\n\nLevy had three sons:\n\nLevy served on the board of the Boston Opera Company, was chairman emeritus of the United Jewish Appeal (Music Division) and helped raise millions of dollars for other charities. He was named \"Man of the Year\" by United Jewish Appeal in 1973, serving on the board of Columbia County Hospital and he chaired fundraisers for the Black Congressional Choir, the Foundling Hospital, and St. Patrick's Cathedral Choir.\n\nThe Morris Levy Charitable Foundation was created following his death in 1990.\n\nLevy was played by Paul Mazursky in the 1998 film \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\" and he has been cited as an inspiration for the HBO television series \"The Sopranos\" (1999-2007) character Hesh Rabkin — who made a fortune defrauding mostly R&B performers, underpaying royalties, pressing unauthorized records, and who owned lavish New Jersey horse-racing stables.\n\nLevy featured prominently in the 2010 autobiography \"Me, The Mob, and The Music\" by Tommy James, leader of the 1960s rock band Tommy James and the Shondells. James had not felt comfortable writing the book until all those who were deeply involved with the record company had died. The book reportedly is to be made both into a film and a Broadway play. Martin Scorsese approached James about making a movie of the book shortly after publication.\n\nIn the book, James characterized Levy as willing to strong-arm the talent, saying artists signed to Roulette were there to produce money for the company, having their needs met only when it pleased Levy. Asking to be paid meant intimidation; to survive, those under contract to Roulette needed to find a means of generating income that did not involve the record company, such as personally booked tours. While a Roulette artist had great creative control when recording for the company, the lack of payment for those efforts was difficult.\n\nJames estimated that Roulette owed him $30–40 million in unpaid royalties. James said Roulette was a front for organized crime, and functioned as a money laundering operation. In the early 1970s, Levy was at the wrong end of a mob war. James had to leave New York for a time to avoid a mob hit, which explained why he recorded an album in Nashville in 1972.\n\nIt was only after Roulette Records and Levy's Big Seven Music publishing company were sold (the record company to an EMI and Rhino Records partnership, the music publishing company to Windswept Pacific Music which was later sold to EMI) that James began to receive significant royalty checks from sales of his records.\n\n"}

It comprises two extant Andean and two fossil species. The living members are commonly known as the huemul (from the Mapuche language), and the taruca.\n\nBoth species have a stocky, thick, and short-legged body. They live at high altitudes in the summer, then move down the mountains in the fall and spend the winter in sheltered forested valleys. Areas with fresh water are preferred. They are herbivores that feed primarily on herbaceous plants and shrubs as well as sedges, lichens, and grasses found between the rocks on high peaks. They are active during daytime and have a lifespan of about ten years.\n\nThe huemul (\"Hippocamelus bisulcus\"), also known as the South Andean deer, is found in Chile and Argentina. Huemuls live in groups of varying size, typically of two or three individuals, but sometimes as many as eleven. In the past, groups of over a hundred deer were reported. Groups are made up of a female and her young, while males are often alone.\n\nHuemul occur in several national parks in Chile and neighbouring parts of Argentina and have been on the Endangered list since 1996. They are endangered primarily due to human impacts such as deforestation, habitat fragmentation by roads, introduction of non-native mammals such as farm animals, and poaching. They are in a classic \"extinction spiral\" marked by increasingly small, isolated populations.\n\nThe huemul is, along with the condor, the national animal of Chile.\n\nThe taruca (\"Hippocamelus antisensis\"), is found in Peru, as well as parts of Bolivia, and in treeless Puna grasslands. They live at high altitudes, from 2,500 to 5,200 meters above sea level. Social habits include grazing in flexible groups of up to thirty animals consisting of one or two males and several females.\n\nIn 2008, a genetic study indicated that the huemul and taruca may not be closely related, and that the taruca should therefore be placed in a separate genus. This has yet to be confirmed by other studies.\n\nFossils belonging to the now extinct species \"Hippocamelus sulcatus\" have been identified from Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. This species inhabited lowland plains habitats, rather than mountains, and lived between 1.5 and 0.5 million years ago, during the mid to late Pleistocene. Its exact relationship to the living species is unclear. A second fossil species, †\"Hippocamelus percultus\", is known from the Bolivian Andes, and lived around 40,000 to 20,000 years ago; it may be a direct ancestor of the living taruca.\n\nBoth species are threatened according to the IUCN. The south Andean deer is endangered and the taruca is vulnerable.\n"}

A shooting-brake was a brake pressed into service to carry beaters, gamekeepers and sportsmen with their dogs, guns and game. \n\nThere were purpose-built shooting-brakes designed to carry the driver and a footman or gamekeeper at the front facing forward, and passengers on longitudinal benches, with their dogs, guns and game borne along the sides in slatted racks.\n\nIn the 19th century, a brake was a large, four-wheeled carriage-frame with no body, used for breaking in young horses, either singly or in teams of two or four. It has no body parts except for a high seat upon which the driver sits and a small platform for a helper immediately behind.\nIf the passenger seats were made permanent the vehicle might be described as a waggonette. \n\nWhen automobiles were first developed, the term \"brake\" was also applied to those with bodies similar to a horse-drawn brake. Currently the word is sometimes used for an estate car (see also shooting-brake) or station wagon. In France, the term \"break\" is synonymous with a \"station wagon\", having been called a \"break de chasse\", literally translated: \"hunting break.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2105840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105840", "title": "Ephat Mujuru", "text": "Ephat Mujuru\n\nEphat Mujuru (1950–2001), was a Zimbabwean musician, one of the 20th century's finest players of the mbira, a traditional instrument of the Shona ethnic group of Zimbabwe.\n\nAlthough Mujuru played all of Zimbabwe's five types of mbira, he specialty was the \"mbira dzavadzimu\".\nEphat Mujuru was raised in a small village in Manicaland, near the Mozambican border, and was taught to play the mbira by his grandfather, Muchatera Mujuru. Muchatera was a medium for one of the most important ancestor spirits in Shona cosmology, Chaminuka. Showing clear talent for the rigours of mbira training, Ephat advanced quickly, playing his first possession ceremony when he was just ten. At his Rhodesian-run Catholic school, young Mujuru's teachers told him that to play mbira was a \"sin against God.\" This irritated Muchatera so much that he withdrew his grandson and sent him to school in an African township outside the capital, Salisbury, present day Harare. \nIn the big city, Mujuru hesitated before committing himself to the life of a musician. He recalled in a 1994 interview, \"I worked in an accounting office. But the people there were very colonial. They had so much hate on. They didn't respect African people.\" Amid excuses, the office ultimately fired Mujuru. \"It was sad,\" he said, \"Because I thought life was beginning, and then I had no job. I was eighteen and very confused.\" \nAll along, Mujuru says that there was a \"silent voice\" telling him that his hope lay in mbira music. Following that voice, Mujuru began spending time in the village of Bandambira, where he studied with a great old mbira player of the same name. In the highland corn fields near Mhondoro, beneath Zimbabwe's big skies full of large birds, battleship clouds, and horsetail sunsets, Mujuru reaffirmed his ties to the mbira. Soon, he went to live and apprentice with another master player, Simon Mashoko. \n\nSoon, Mujuru's path became clear—to follow in the footsteps of Muchatera Mujuru, Mubayiwa Bandambira, and Simon Mashoka. \"They had respect,\" said Mujuru emphatically. \"They were not as rich as those accounting people, but they were much happier.\" \n\nIn 1972, Mujuru formed his first group, Chaminuka, the group he performed with throughout the brutal decade of the independence war. In this period, Mujuru managed to get national radio play for a slyly political song. \"How can I cross the river?\" asked the song \"Guruswa,\" which means ancient Africa in Shona. Perhaps Rhodesian radio programmers heard only quaint nostalgia in the song, but future Zimbabweans got the message. \"It was talking about our struggle to free ourselves.\" explained Mujuru. \"We wanted the place to be like it was before colonization.\" \nIn the context of war, the mbira became political. Thomas Mapfumo transposed mbira music onto electric instruments to create chimurenga music, named for the chimurenga guerillas. Mujuru says, \"When we played mbira, people would come and dance with a special feeling. `Hey, we are going to be independent!'\" Sadly, by the time the war was won, Mujuru's grandfather Muchatera, had become one of its victims. He was executed by guerillas who thought his bira ceremonies were directed at achieving peace, rather than victory. \nMujuru played all of Zimbabwe's five types of mbira, but his specialty is the popular mbira dzavadzimu. Where mbira can have from fifteen to fifty iron prongs, the mbira dzavadzimu has twenty-two, arranged in three register banks that Mujuru characterizes as \"voice of the children, voice of the adults, and voice of the elders.\" The prongs, often made from flattened bed springs, get clamped tightly onto a laminated slab of hard Mubvamaropa wood. Mbira makers often attach shells or bottle caps to the mbira's tin shield to produce a resonating buzz that complements the chiming character of the notes. For amplification, players use sticks to jam the instrument into a large, halved calabash that serves as a resonating chamber. \nLike any serious mbira player, Mujuru had mastered a large repertoire of traditional songs. But he was also a prolific composer, with many original titles and unique interpretations of traditional songs to his credit. Apart from his musical prowess, Mujuru was an inspirational story teller. Over the years, he transformed the venerable art of telling allegorical tales for children into a personalized narrative and musical form that conveyed both wisdom and delightful humor to adults and children alike. In one story, a hyena confronted with a dead cow and a dead goat cannot decide which to eat first, and dies of starvation while pacing greedily back and forth between the two prizes. \nAfter Zimbabweans ultimately gained independence on April 18, 1980, the work of building a new nation began. Renaming his group Spirit of the People, Mujuru recorded his first album in 1981, using only mbira, hand drums, hosho, and singers. He sang about brotherhood and healing, crucial themes during a time when the nation's dominant ethnic groups, the Shona and Ndebele, struggled to work out their differences. \n\nIndependence and a measure of commercial success brought new possibilities for Mujuru. He helped to found the National Dance Company and became the first African music teacher to teach ethnomusicology at the top western classical tradition Zimbabwe College of Music. In 1982, Mujuru came to the US for the first time to study and, eventually, lecture and teach mbira at the University of Washington in Seattle. Throughout the 1980s, Mujuru traveled widely, returning to Zimbabwe to record two more traditional albums. In the United States, he released an album of traditional hand drumming, Rhythms of Life (Lyrichord), recorded in Boston in 1989, with a few mbira tracks added from an earlier vinyl release on Lyrichord. \n\nDuring the 1990s, Mujuru continued to travel and perform, and in the United States, he recorded two albums for Music of the World. Ancient Wisdom is a solo recording, and Shona Spirit is a collaboration with another of Shona music's great international ambassadors, Dumisani Maraire. Mujuru also recorded an ambitious, multi-track album he called Journey of the Spirit, which has yet to be released. Back in Zimbabwe, he also released successful pop albums with a revamped, electric version of Spirit of the People. In 1992, Mujuru's first electric album Hapana Mutorwa made its way to the top of the local charts, edging out Zimbabwe sungura kings Leonard Dembo and John Chibadura. But as conditions worsened in Zimbabwe, Mujuru traveled and recorded less. When Afropop Worldwide last interviewed him in March, 2001, he had just finished two new recordings, one acoustic, traditional session, and one with a new band, members of a Zimbabwe rumba outfit called Eden Boys. In early September, the electric album, Musiyano, was released and got a very positive review in The Daily News in Zimbabwe, under the heading, \"Mujuru back with a bang.\" Mujuru seemed poised for a genuine comeback. But less than a month later, on October 5, he died in London, while traveling with his cousins Fradreck and Sam. He was on his way to begin a residency at Grinnell College in Iowa. Sadly, Ephat Mujuru suffered a massive heart attack that day in Gatwick Airport and died on his way to a hospital.\nSeveral of Mujuru's children are professional musicians, most notably mbira master James Mujuru, who is continuing his father's musical legacy. Currently based in Harare, he has lived and work extensively in North America.\n\nDuring the late 90s, Mujuru was part of facilitators at the National Indigenous Music Festivals hosted by Mambo Arts Commune in Botswana. His last visit to Botswana was in August 2001 at Shoshong Senior Secondary School.\n"}

In particular, he was noted for writing and producing \"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\", \"Leader of the Pack\", and other hits for girl group The Shangri-Las.\n\nHe was born in Brooklyn, New York and then raised in Hicksville, Long Island, where he met his high school sweet heart and future wife, Lois Berman and formed a doo-wop group, the Marquees. He became friendly with Ellie Greenwich, and did drop-in visits to her and her songwriting partner (later husband) Jeff Barry when they were working at the Brill Building.\n\nAccording to a \"Biography\" episode on various 1960s Brill Building pop songwriters which included interviews with Greenwich, Barry and Morton among others, Barry said that at the time he was suspicious of Morton's overt attention to Greenwich. Skeptical that Morton was really the songwriter he claimed to be, Barry challenged Morton to prove his legitimacy and bring in samples of his recent work (expecting never to hear again from the unheard-of Morton). Morton stated in his interview that, with an empty song portfolio at the time, he felt sufficiently challenged by Barry, whereupon he left the Brill Building and drove to a Long Island beach. Full of inspiration and determination, Morton spent the evening writing most of his first song \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\" while sitting in the dark in his parked car, and the rest of it in the shower back home before heading back to Barry. Morton then 'rolled the dice' and recorded a demo of his song at Long Island's Ultrasonic Recording Studios with an unknown local girl-group that he admired, The Shangri-Las (according to Morton, with the then-unknown Billy Joel on piano in the demo recording), and offered the demo recording to Jerry Leiber, who was then setting up Red Bird Records. \"Remember (Walking In The Sand)\" reached #5 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1964. This accomplishment transformed Morton overnight from a credential-less industry 'wannabe' into a hit songwriter and producer. According to Steve Kurutz at Allmusic, \"Morton's production work, which included brilliant sound effects and inventive percussion, carried the Shangri-Las to girl-group history.\"\n\nMorton signed as a staff producer for Red Bird Records. He was nicknamed \"Shadow\" by record company executive George Goldner because his whereabouts could never be pinned down. He was a key architect in creating the girl group sound of the mid-1960s, by continuing to write and produce hit teen melodramas for the Shangri-Las and the Goodies, including \"Leader of the Pack\", \"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\", \"I Can Never Go Home Anymore\", \"Past, Present and Future\" and \"Sophisticated Boom Boom\". These juxtaposed teen lyrics against a mixture of pop, R&B and even the classics, with sound effects and inventive percussion.\n\nIn 1967, his successes continued after the collapse of Red Bird when his production of Janis Ian's \"Society's Child\", became a hit record. The same year, he discovered a group called Mark Stein & the Pigeons, who became Vanilla Fudge, and produced their first three albums, which included their hit version of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On,\" followed by a foray into aural collage called \"The Beat Goes On\". The experimentation was largely Morton's idea; it was resisted by the band and poorly received by critics, though it reached #17 in the US Billboard Top 200 based on sales. Morton also worked with Iron Butterfly; the group gave an interview to \"Mix Magazine\" crediting him with producing the hit track \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\". Morton told film producer Larry Schweikart in 2009 that the band was too uptight to get the song down, so he faked an equipment malfunction on the soundboard and told them to practice. In fact, he was rolling tape, and he kept giving them the \"keep it up\" sign, resulting in the long solos and the famous drum solo.\n\nIn 1970 Morton produced the psychedelic heavy rock band Haystacks Balboa, a New York City based quintet who toured nationally as support for Rod Stewart, Ten Years After and Jethro Tull.. In 1971 Morton produced the Polydor Records album \"Uncle Chapin\", the sole release of the seven piece jazz rock horn group formerly known as Stonehammer. He also produced all-girl group Isis, and worked with The New York Dolls, producing their second album \"Too Much Too Soon\". Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders would later cover his composition \"Great Big Kiss\" on his 1978 solo album \"So Alone\". In 1972, Shadow produced the Boston comedy band Gross National Productions' album \"P-Flaps and Low Blows\".\n\nMorton then disappeared from the music industry for several years, and was treated for alcoholism in 1987 at the Betty Ford Center. He later filed a lawsuit with Polygram Records for the unauthorised use of his music, most famously two Shangri-Las songs that were featured in the 1990 film \"Goodfellas\".\n\nHe was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006. In 2009, Morton appeared in the documentary, \"Rockin' the Wall,\" about music's part in bringing down the Iron Curtain, along with former Vanilla Fudge members Mark Stein and Vinny Martell, as well as David Paich of Toto, Rudy Sarzo of Quiet Riot, Robby Krieger of the Doors, Billy Joel and Joan Jett.\n\nShadow Morton died on February 14, 2013 in Laguna Beach, California, from cancer.\n\n"}

Originally widespread, it has suffered severely from competition with introduced marram grass and animal grazing and now has only a patchy distribution.\n\nPīngao is a stout, grass-like plant, 30–90 cm tall, from the sedge family, found on active sand dunes. It is found only in New Zealand and is easily distinguished from other dune species such as spinifex or marram grass. Seen from a distance, pīngao patches have a distinctive orange hue.\n\nMost plants produce long, prostrate, tough rope-like stolons that creep along the sand surface until buried by shifting sand, leaving just the upper portion of leaves exposed. Some southern South Island populations produce dense tussock-like plants without extensive stolons.\n\nNumerous tough, roughly textured leaves are borne in dense tufts on well-spaced, short, upright stems (tillers), along the length of stolons. The narrow leaves are 2–5 mm wide, with colour ranging from bright green when young through golden yellow to a deep orange on mature plants.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>Small, dark brown flowers appear in spring and are arranged spirally in tight clusters around the upper 10–30 cm of the upright stem (culm), interspersed with leaf-like bracts. The seeds are shiny, dark brown, egg-shaped, 3–5 mm long, and ripen and fall in early summer. Pīngao can also reproduce vegetatively with its stolons.\n\nPīngao was first scientifically described by Achille Richard in 1832, and was given the name \"Isolepis spiralis\". In 1853 Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker placed Pīngao in the genus \"Desmoschoenus\". In 2010 A. M. Muasyaa and P. J. de Lange merged the genus \"Desmoschoenus\" into \"Ficinia\" after their research showed that the two were indistinguishable.\n\nOne Māori name for pīngao (or pikao, in Ngai Tahu dialect) is \"ngā tukemata o Tāne\", or \"Tāne's eyebrows\". \n\nLeaves from pīngao, which turn bright yellow as they dry, are used by Māori in traditional weaving, especially the construction of hats (pōtae), bags (kete), and mats (whāriki). It is also used to create decorative tukutuku panels in a wharenui. The length, width, and strength of the leaves for weaving vary among pīngao populations growing in different areas. Leaves were also used by Māori for thatching.\n\nPīngao is an important sand-binding plant, but is out-competed by introduced sand binding species such as marram and \"Pinus radiata\", and introduced weeds such as yellow tree lupins. Marram and pines create more stable dunes, so during colonisation large areas of pīngao were burnt. It is now restricted to scattered patches around coastal New Zealand, and is actively planted by community groups and the Department of Conservation when restoring native ecosystems.\n\n"}
{"id": "2105858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105858", "title": "Rock concert", "text": "Rock concert\n\nA rock concert is a musical performance in the style of any one of many genres inspired by \"rock and roll\" music. While a variety of vocal and instrumental styles can constitute a rock concert, this phenomenon is typically characterized by bands playing at least one electric guitar, an electric bass guitar, and drums. Often, two guitar players share the tasks of rhythm and lead guitar playing. Rock concerts also have a social history which shapes the perception of the linguistic term and the activity itself.\n\nDuring the 1950s, several American musical groups experimented with new musical forms that fused country music, blues, and swing genre to produce the earliest examples of \"rock and roll.\" The coining of the phrase, \"rock and roll,\" is often attributed to American, Alan Freed, a disk jockey and concert promoter who organized many of the first major rock concerts. Since then, the rock concert has become a staple of entertainment not only in the United States, but around the world.\n\nThe term 'rock concert' is also occasionally used to refer to live performances by distinctly non-rock acts. Live performances by pop, hip-hop, and R&B bands may not be rock concerts in the strictest sense, but they are often referred to as rock concerts regardless. These performances typically share many characteristics with rock concerts, such as an overall party atmosphere.\n\nBill Graham is widely credited with setting the format and standards for modern rock concerts. He introduced advance ticketing (and later computerized, online tickets), introduced modern security measures (a reaction to the deaths at the Altamont concert) and had clean toilets and safe conditions in large venues.\n\nRock concerts are often associated with certain kinds of behavior. Dancing, shouting, singing along with the band, and ostentatious displays by the musicians are common, though some very successful rock bands have avoided gratuitous flash in favor of understated performances focusing on the music itself. Even so, rock concerts often have a playful atmosphere both for the band and the audience.\n\nLike rock music in general, rock concerts are emblematic of American culture's waning formality. Such concerts were crucial to the formation of youth identity in the U.S. during a time of social revolution, and have continued to represent elements of society frequently seen as \"rebellious,\" especially against the strictures of mid-twentieth-century social normativities. One of the most well-known rock concerts was undoubtedly Woodstock, and millions of much smaller rock concerts go on every year.\n\nRock concerts are often performed at very high decibel levels. Prolonged exposure to noise at these levels can permanently damage the bones of the middle ear and the nerves of the inner ear. Thus health officials recommend that concertgoers use earplugs. Since the 1960s, many musicians have worn earplugs at concerts, and some concert promoters actually give out free earplugs.\n\n\n"}

He specialized in the form of \"mbira\" called \"nyunga nyunga\", as well as the Zimbabwean marimba. He introduced Zimbabwean music to North America, initiating a flourishing of Zimbabwean music in the Pacific Northwest that continues into the 21st century.\n\nDumi is credited for his famous 1–15 number notation used on the \"nyunga nyunga\" mbira and for notating the song \"Chemutengure\" on the \"nyunga nyunga\" mbira. The song \"Chemutengure\" is used to teach mbira learners the technique of playing the instrument.\n\nDumi was born in Mutare, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He began learning music from family members, and later at the college of music in Bulawayo. Maraire taught from 1968 through 1972 at the University of Washington in Seattle, where his daughter Chiwoniso Maraire (also a musician) was born. His sons−Dumisani Maraire, Jr., who performs under the stage name Draze; Tendai Maraire of the hip hop duo Shabazz Palaces; and Zhiyanai Maraire, who performs as ZNi International−also became musicians.

{"id": "2105880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105880", "title": "Fanagalo", "text": "Fanagalo\n\nFanakalo is a vernacular or pidgin (simplified language) based primarily on Zulu, with English and a small Afrikaans input. It is used as a lingua franca, mainly in the gold, diamond, coal and copper mining industries in South Africa and to a lesser extent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although it is used as a second language only, the number of speakers was estimated as \"several hundred thousand\" in 1975. Once the British left, English became the lingua franca enabling different tribes in the same country to communicate with each other, and Fanakalo use declined.\n\nFanakalo is the only Zulu-based pidgin language, and is a rare example of a pidgin based on an indigenous language rather than on the language of a colonising or trading power.\n\nThe variety in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) is known as Chilapalapa and is influenced by Shona, while the variety in Zambia (Northern Rhodesia), called Cikabanga (pronounced, and sometimes spelt, Chikabanga), is influenced by Bemba.\n\nThe name \"Fanakalo\" comes from strung-together Nguni forms fana-ga-lo meaning \"like + of + that\" and has the meaning \"do it like this\", reflecting its use as a language of instruction. Other spellings of the name include \"Fanagalo\" and \"Fanekolo\". It is also known as \"Isikula, Lololo\" or \"Isilololo, Piki\" or \"Isipiki\", and \"Silunguboi\". \n\nAs the indigenous people from whom Fanagalo originated traditionally had no written language, the orthography of Fanagalo is not standardized; for example, the sounds of W and B are very close.\n\nLike Turkish, Fanagalo is characterized by certain amount of vowel harmony, wherein a vowel in a prefix is changed according to the subsequent vowel. In the Nguni tongues, the prefix \"Mu-\" or \"Ma-\" denotes the singular, while \"Bu-\" or \"Ba-\" signifies the plural – hence \"Muntu\" = a man; \"Bantu\" = men, particularly when applied to tribes, e.g. \"Ma-tabele\". Similarly, the prefix \"Chi-\" or \"Si-\" indicates the language spoke by that tribe. e.g. men of the \"Lozi\" tribe are called \"Ba-rotse\" (spelling is not standardized), and they speak \"Si-lozi\"; Bembas speak Chiwemba; Tswanas live in Botswana, formerly called Bechuanaland.\n\nChi-lapa-lapa thus is the \"language\" derived from \"lapa\" = \"there\", with reduplication for emphasis.\n\nFanagalo is one of a number of African pidgin languages that developed during the colonial period to promote ease of communication. suggests that it developed in the nineteenth century in KwaZulu-Natal Province as a way for English colonists to communicate with their servants and was also used as a lingua franca between English and Dutch/Afrikaans speaking colonists.\n\nFanagalo was used extensively in gold and diamond mines because the South African mining industry employed workers on fixed contracts from across southern and central Africa: including Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique. With workers originating from a range of countries and having a vast range of different mother tongues, Fanagalo provided a simple way to communicate and is still used as a training and operating medium. Fifteen hours instruction was considered sufficient for an initiate to become reasonably fluent. See Witwatersrand Native Labour Association.\n\nAdendorff describes two variants of the language, Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo. The latter name refers to its use with servants in households. It was previously known as Kitchen Kaffir. (The term \"kaffir\" tended, in Southern Africa, to be used as a derogatory term for black people, and is now considered extremely offensive. It is derived from the Arab word Kafir, meaning unbeliever.)\n\nIn the mid-20th century in South Africa there were Government efforts to promote and standardise Fanagalo as a universal second language, under the name of \"Basic Bantu\".\n\nIn contrast, mining companies in the early 21st century have attempted to phase out Fanagalo in favour of the pre-existing, local languages. Ravyse (2018) discusses Fanagalo's apparent resistance to opposing official policy, in spite of its ongoing stigma as a language for the illiterate. Fanagalo has become intertwined with the culture of the mining industry, and its continuation seems to hinge on the ongoing favour of its speaking community, rather than industry policy. \n\nMining aside, Adendorff also suggests that Fanagalo has unfavourable and negative connotations for many South Africans. However, he raises the point that Fanagalo is sometimes used between white South Africans, particularly expatriates, as a signal of South African origin and a way of conveying solidarity in an informal manner. That role has of late largely been taken over by Afrikaans; even among English speaking South African expatriates.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, holiday makers from the Rhodesias often used to go on holiday to Lourenço Marques in Mozambique (now Maputo), where many people speak Portuguese – but most also spoke a form of Fanagalo.\n\nAll three languages are currently experiencing a revival in their popularity as a lingua franca, now freed from connotations of \"colonialism\" and valued for their intrinsic usefulness.\n\nRhodesian comedian Wrex Tarr was famous for routines that make extensive use of Chilapalapa.\n\nMine Fanagalo in South Africa and Zimbabwe is based mostly on Zulu vocabulary (about 70%), with English (about 25%) and some words from Afrikaans (5%). It does not have the range of Zulu inflections, and it tends to follow English word order. \n\nAdendorff describes Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo as being basically the same pidgin. He suggests that Garden Fanagalo should be seen as lying towards the English end of a continuum, and Mine Fanagalo closer to the Zulu end.\n\nSeveral key features differentiate Fanagalo from the Nguni languages (such as Zulu and Xhosa). \"Lo\" functions as both an article and a demonstrative, while only a demonstrative in Zulu. \"Lapha\" is used to mean \"here\", also meaning \"there\" when the first syllable is stressed, and is also used as a general preposition for location. (It works for anything such as \"on\", or \"near\", etc.) Zulu, on the other hand, only uses \"lapha\"to mean \"here\". Additionally, Fanagalo only uses free pronouns: \"mina\", \"thina\", \"wena\", \"ena\", meaning \"I, we, you, he/she/it/they\". Zulu only uses pronouns for emphasis, relying instead on verb agreement markers, much like Spanish. \n\nThe past tense of verbs is marked by the suffix \"-ile\" (\"hamba \"I go, go!\", \"hambile\" \"I went\"), and the future with the modal \"azi\" (\"azi hamba\" \"will go\").\"\n\nHere are two examples (all letters are pronounced):-\n\n\"Koki Lobin\"\nCock Robin\n\n\"Zonke nyoni lapa moyo ena kala, ena kala\"\nAll birds of air, they cried, they cried\n\"Ena izwile ena file lo nyoni Koki Lobin\"\nThey heard the death the bird Cock Robin\n\"Ena izwile, ena file, ena izwile ena file Cocky Lobin.\"\n\n\"Kubani ena bulalile Koki Lobin?\"\nWho they killed Cock Robin\n\"Mina kruma lo Sparrow\"\nMe, said the sparrow\n\"Na lo picannin bow and arrow kamina\"\nWith the little bow & arrow of mine\n\"Mina bulalile Koki Lobin.\"\nI killed Cock Robin\n\n\"TANDAZO\"\n\n\"Baba ga tina, Wena kona pezulu,\"\nFather of ours, You are above\n\" Tina bonga lo Gama ga wena; \"\nWe thank (for) the name of you\n\"Tina vuma lo mteto ga wena Lapa mhlaba, fana na pezulu.\"\n\"Niga tina namuhla lo zinkwa yena izwasisa;\"\nGive us today etc., etc... \n\"Futi, yekelela masono gatina,\"\n\"Loskati tina yekelela masono ga lomunye.\"\n\"Hayi letisa tina lapa lo cala; Kodwa, sindisa tina ku lo bubi,\"\n\"Ndaba Wena kona lo-mteto, lo mandla, na lo dumela, Zonkeskat.

The 72.1-mile (114 km) parkway will connect U.S. Route 129 (U.S. 129) along the Little Tennessee River in the west with Interstate 40 (I-40) along the Pigeon River in the east.\n\nPortions pass through parts of Blount, Sevier, and Cocke counties. Large sections cross a series of high ridges running roughly parallel to the Tennessee boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and offer unobstructed views of the Great Smokies to the south and the Tennessee Valley to the north.\n\nThe oldest unfinished highway project in Tennessee, the Foothills Parkway project has been continuously stalled by funding difficulties since Congress authorized its construction in 1944. As of 2018, just over one-half of the parkway has been completed and opened to vehicular traffic, although the right of way for the full length has been acquired.\n\nSections 8E & 8F (including the \"Missing Link\") of the parkway was announced completed on November 8, 2018 and opened to the public on Saturday, November 10, 2018, adding 16.1 finished miles.\nPreviously, the longest open section (8H and 8G) consisted of a leg traversing the western flank of Chilhowee Mountain in Blount county, connecting U.S. 129 along the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River with U.S. 321 in the town of Walland. The other open section (8A) is a stretch traversing Green Mountain in Cocke county, connecting U.S. 321 in Cosby with I-40 in the Pigeon River valley.\n\nThe Gatlinburg Bypass, which traverses the eastern flank of Cove Mountain between the north end of Gatlinburg and the national park, connecting to the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway at each end, is also considered part of the parkway. The Great Smoky Mountains Parkway (U.S. 441) from Gatlinburg north to Pigeon Forge is also National Park Service land, connecting the bypass to the right of way for future sections (8D and 8C) of the Foothills Parkway at the southern city limit of Pigeon Forge.\n\nThe parkways are managed by the National Park Service as part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Unlike other national parkways, they are not a separate unit of the national park system. As with other NPS roads, construction (including repaving) is handled by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) through the Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP) partnership.\n\nThe foothills of the Great Smokies consist of a series of low mountains and hills lying roughly between the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the south and the flatlands of the Tennessee River and French Broad River valleys to the north. The most prominent of the foothills are characterized by long-but-narrow ridges, running parallel to the crest of the Smokies, similar to a circuit wall surrounding a medieval castle.\n\nAlthough the average elevation of the foothills is relatively low, a high topographic prominence is not uncommon among these ridges, due to their detachment from the main crest of the Smokies. English Mountain (3,629 ft), one of the highest of the foothills, is the fifth most prominent mountain in Tennessee, and dominates the view south of Interstate 40 for a considerable stretch between Sevierville and Newport. Chilhowee Mountain, located mostly in Blount County is the first major geological structure visible when approaching the mountains via Lamar Alexander Parkway (U.S. 321), and its eastern flank, known as \"The Three Sisters\", is visible from almost anywhere in Maryville.\n\nGeologically, the foothills largely consist of Cambrian Class III rocks of the Paleozoic period, a type known specifically as the Chilhowee Group. Chilhowee Group rocks, which are mostly sandstones, siltstones, and shales, range in age from about 300 million to 500 million years old. Thus, the rocks of the foothills are much younger than the billion-year old Precambrian Ocoee Supergroup rocks that form the crest and higher ridges of the Great Smokies range.\n\nThe most prominent of the foothills include:\n\nChilhowee Mountain — a narrow ridge stretching between the Little Tennessee River (specifically the river's Chilhowee Lake impoundment) and the Little Pigeon River valley to the east. While the mountain is long, it rarely reaches a width of more than 3 or . Little River cuts a large gap in the middle of the mountain (near Walland), dividing it into eastern and western sections. The highest point on eastern section is 2,843 feet (866m) and the highest point on the western section is 2,650 feet (807m) at a knob known as Look Rock. \n\nBates Mountain — a low, bulky ridge between Miller Cove and Tuckaleechee Cove. Bates' highest point is just over . Although Bates lacks the dramatic \"backbone\" formation of Chilhowee, a rocky gorge on its south flank cut by Carr Creek has presented numerous construction challenges for the parkway project. \n\nCove Mountain — a large ridge situated between Wears Valley to the west, Gatlinburg to the east, and Pigeon Forge to the north. The national park boundary traverses part of the crest of Cove Mountain. The mountain's elevation reaches 4,077 feet (1,243m) at its summit. \n\nWebb Mountain — a long, narrow ridge stretching roughly from the Middle Prong of the Little Pigeon River in the west to the Cosby area in the east, a distance of roughly 10 miles (14 km). Webb Mountain dominates the view north of U.S. 321 between Pittman Center and Cosby. Its summit, near the middle of the ridge, is 3,100 feet (945m) above sea level. \n\nGreen Mountain — a small mountain stretching between Cosby to the west and the Pigeon River valley to the east. Its highest point is 2,785 feet (849m) above sea level. \n\nEnglish Mountain, the highest of the Foothills at 3,629 feet (1,112m), stretches for nearly between the East Fork of the Little Pigeon and Newport, paralleling the shores of Douglas Lake. Hall Top (Stone Mountain) rises prominently opposite Green Mountain above the Pigeon River valley. The parkway will not cross any part of English Mountain or Hall Top, however.\n\nThe foothills of the Great Smokies were drawing tourists as early as the mid-19th century. Most visitors during this period came for the area's mineral-rich mountain springs, which were thought to have health-restoring qualities. Resort hotels quickly sprang up throughout the foothills, becoming popular summertime destinations for Knoxville's upper class. The most successful of these resorts were Montvale Springs and Alleghany Springs at the base of Chilhowee Mountain, Kinzel Springs in Tuckaleechee, Line Springs in Wears Valley, and Carson Springs near Newport.\n\nJust before the Civil War, author Sidney Lanier spent several summers at Montvale Springs. The Chilhowee Mountain area would be a major influence on the setting for his first novel, \"Tiger Lilies\". In 1885, Mary Noailles Murfree, one of the first authors to popularize the natural wonders of the Smokies, wrote:\n\n... Chilhowee Mountain, rising up, massive and splendid, against the west. The shadows of the clouds flecked the pure and perfect blue of the sunny slopes with a dusky motling of purple.\nThe original plan for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park included much of the foothills within the proposed park boundaries, although by the time the park opened in 1934, the boundary had been moved south of Townsend and Wears Valley.\n\nWhen Congress authorized the construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway in the 1930s, it was decided that no part of the parkway would pass through Tennessee (the goal of the parkway was to connect the Great Smoky Mountains National Park with Shenandoah National Park). Disappointed, Frank Maloney, who was vice-president of the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association, began lobbying for a parkway to connect the recreational areas on the Tennessee side of the Great Smokies.\n\nIn 1944, after extensive lobbying by Congressman B. Carroll Reece, Congress authorized construction of a road connecting US-129 at Chilhowee Lake and I-40 along the Pigeon River. In 1945, the Tennessee state legislature authorized the Tennessee Highway Department to buy rights-of-way for the road, and a second bill in 1947 authorized the transfer of rights-of-way to the National Park Service.\n\nWhile the early bureaucratic hurdles had been cleared, the Tennessee Highway Department moved slowly in purchasing the road's rights-of-way. In 1956, park superintendent Edward Hummel managed to get the Foothills Parkway project included in the National Park Service's Mission 66 program, assuring early construction funds. Shortly thereafter, Governor Frank G. Clement authorized the THD to begin buying rights-of-way. Construction finally began in 1960.\n\nThe original plan for Foothills Parkway called for eight sections:\n\n\nAfter the initial progress in the 1960s, the project again stalled in the 1970s due to funding cuts. By 1978, less than one-third of the proposed parkway had been completed. Construction on the two sections between Walland and Wears Valley finally began in 1984, but after some progress, was halted due to erosion and other environmental issues, specifically the spilling of sulfuric acid into nearby streams. The corridor's route was redesigned, and construction began again in 1994. Tennessee Congressmen John Duncan, Jr. and James Quillen were instrumental in obtaining federal funding for the project from the 1980s until the 2010s.\n\nIn recent years, the Foothills Parkway project has become controversial due to the already-high volume of vehicular traffic that passes through the Smokies each year. Some argue that the parkway will add to the congestion, while others say it will help relieve congestion by drawing off some of the park's traffic. Furthermore, because parkways always seem to rank low in budgetary priorities, it will likely take several more decades to complete the entire parkway. The Blue Ridge Parkway, the major influence for Foothills Parkway, had taken over five decades to complete in 1984; likewise, construction on the Natchez Trace Parkway, which began in 1939, was not completed until 2005.\n\nAlthough no funding has been set aside for the remaining sections of the parkway between Wears Valley and Cosby, the NPS still owns the rights-of-way, and their completion has not been ruled out. In early 2007, the National Park Service began conducting an environmental impact assessment and collecting public input regarding section 8B (Pittman Center to Cosby), .\n\nMuch like the Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive, the completed sections of the Foothills Parkway traverse what would be otherwise roadless ridge crests, allowing for extensive views of the surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chilhowee Mountain section of the parkway has been open since 1966. There are four overlooks on its north side (looking into the Tennessee Valley), and eight overlooks on its south side (looking into the Smokies).\n\nThe highest point on the western section of Chilhowee Mountain is 2,650 ft (808 m) at a knob known as Look Rock. An observation tower has been erected there, allowing a 360-degree view of Blount County and the Western Smokies. The parking area for Look Rock is just off the parkway, with a half-mile trail leading to the tower.\n\nThe Rich Mountain/Cades Cove Mountain massif dominates the view immediately to the east. Gregory Bald rises like a giant dome to the south-southeast. To the southwest, the Yellow Creek section of the Unicoi Mountains is visible, along with a dramatic view of Chilhowee's western ridgeline.\n\nSeveral of the highest mountains in the Smokies can be seen from Look Rock. Clingmans Dome and Thunderhead Mountain are visible to the southeast, and Mount Le Conte is visible to the east. On a clear day, the high peaks of the Eastern Smokies— Mount Guyot, Mount Chapman, and Old Black— are visible farther to the east.\n\nLooking north from Look Rock, most of Blount and parts of Loudon and Monroe counties are visible. Knoxville's McGhee Tyson Airport presents as a long greenish strip to the north-northwest, and to the north the lights of Knoxville begin to appear around sunset. The Cumberland Plateau dominates much of the northern horizon.\n\nFoothills Parkway crosses Green Mountain in diagonal fashion, traversing the southwest and northeastern flanks of the mountain. From the southwest section, Mount Cammerer and the Eastern Smokies dominate the view. From the northeast section, English Mountain presents as a large ridge to the northwest, and Hall Top rises in peak-like fashion to the east. The lights of Newport are visible early in the morning and later in the evening.\n\nPart of the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway (U.S. 441/321, often just called \"Parkway\") is considered a \"spur\" of the unbuilt part of the Foothills Parkway. \n\n\n"}

He was the music director for \"The Merv Griffin Show\" and participated in episodes of the educational music television series \"Schoolhouse Rock!\"\n\nSheldon was born in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. He originally became known through his participation in the West Coast jazz movement of the 1950s, performing and recording with such figures as Stan Kenton, Art Pepper, Gerry Mulligan, and Curtis Counce. Sheldon played the trumpet, sang, and performed on \"The Merv Griffin Show\". He was Griffin's sidekick for many years. Prior to joining Griffin's show, he served as bandleader for the short-lived \"The Las Vegas Show\".\n\nHis voice is perhaps best known from the \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" cartoons of the 1970s, such as \"Conjunction Junction\" and \"I'm Just a Bill\". He appeared in one episode of \"Johnny Bravo\" as the Sensitive Man. He sang a few songs in the episode similar to the \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" style. Sheldon returned to the \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" series for a 2002 episode titled \"I'm Gonna Send Your Vote to College\", explaining the electoral college process, and distributed on the series' DVD collection that same year. Sheldon sang and played trumpet for the new segment.\n\nSheldon voiced \"Louie the Lightning Bug\" in a series of animated musical public service announcements aimed at children during the 1980s, promoting safety with electricity. In 2001, the \"Louie the Lightning Bug\" videos were updated with new voice-overs by Sheldon and new music tracks produced by Mark Harrelson, with updated musical arrangements by Ray Reach.\n\nHe sang the tune \"King Putt\" for The World According to Goofy Parade at Disneyland, which ran for five months in 1992. A trumpet solo of his is featured throughout the Francis Ford Coppola film, \"One from the Heart\" (1982). Tom Waits' 1977 album \"Foreign Affairs\" includes Sheldon playing trumpet on several cuts, including the solo at the end of \"Burma Shave\".\n\nIn the 1964–1965 season, Sheldon starred with Cara Williams and Frank Aletter on the CBS situation comedy, \"The Cara Williams Show\" in which Williams and Aletter played a married couple trying to keep their marriage a secret because their employer forbade a husband and wife from working together. From 1966–1967, Sheldon starred in his own 16-episode CBS sitcom, \"Run, Buddy, Run\", as Buddy Overstreet, a young accountant taking a steam bath who, overhearing a mobster's plot to kill a colleague, then goes on the run to keep from being killed. Bruce Gordon, formerly of \"The Untouchables\" played the mobster, \"Mr. D\". He made numerous appearances on the 1967–1970 version of \"Dragnet\". He also played John Davidson and Sally Field's brother on \"The Girl with Something Extra\" (1974). In 2004, he performed live at the end of \"ALF's Hit Talk Show\".\n\nSheldon appeared in an Oscar-nominated documentary film \"Let's Get Lost\" about the life of fellow jazz trumpeter Chet Baker. He made an appearance in the 1994 film \"Radioland Murders\" as the ill-fated trumpet player Ruffles Reedy, who becomes a victim of the gruesome goings-on during a 1939 radio show.\n\nJack's poignant trumpet solo on \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" which was introduced in the 1965 film \"The Sandpiper,\" helped earn it Song of the Year at the Grammys and Best Original Song at the Academy Awards.\n\nSheldon performed one of the many versions of the title song featured in Robert Altman's 1973 film \"The Long Goodbye\". His version was intended to be released as a single, but never was.\n\nSheldon is the subject of a documentary, \"Trying to Get Good: the Jazz Odyssey of Jack Sheldon\" (2008). Produced by Doug McIntyre and Penny Peyser, the film features interviews with Clint Eastwood, Billy Crystal, Merv Griffin, Chris Botti, Dave Frishberg, Johnny Mandel, Tierney Sutton, as well as never before seen concert footage of Sheldon playing, singing and joking. \"Trying to Get Good\" won Jury Prizes at the 2008 Kansas City Film Makers Jubilee and Newport Beach Film Festival, as well as Audience Prizes at Newport Beach and the Indianapolis International Film Festival.\n\nSheldon parodied his own performance in \"I'm Just a Bill\" in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" called \"The Day the Violence Died\", where he is an \"amendment to be\". He reprised his roles as the Bill and the Conductor from \"Conjunction Junction\" in two episodes of \"Family Guy\".\n\nSheldon died on December 27, 2019, at the age of 88.\n\n\nWith Curtis Counce\n\nWith Jimmy Giuffre\n\nWith Stan Kenton\n\nWith Tom Waits\n\nWith others\n\n\n"}

He had roles in eleven \"Carry On\" films, and appeared in many British films including \"The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery\" (1966), \"Oh! What a Lovely War\" (1969), \"The Abominable Dr. Phibes\" (1971) and \"Warlords of Atlantis\" (1978). During his early career, he appeared in several stage musicals, including \"Lock Up Your Daughters\" and released a single, \"Follow That Girl\" (HMV POP 740), in 1960. He played Macheath opposite Jan Waters as Polly in a 1968 production of the \"Beggar's Opera\" in London, in which both were praised for their portrayals. After achieving notice in the role of James Onedin, Gilmore felt he had become typecast as the rugged sea captain.\n\nHe later appeared in a \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Frontios\" (1984) in which he played a character called Brazen. Gilmore also appeared in a \"Heartbeat\" episode, called \"The Frighteners\", during the Nick Berry era; his third wife, actress Anne Stallybrass was a regular in the series.\n\nHe married three times: to actress Una Stubbs (1958–1969), with whom he adopted a child; to Jan Waters (1970–1976); and to actress, and former \"Onedin Line\" colleague, Anne Stallybrass (1987–2013), who survived him.\n\nGilmore quit school at the age of 14 and started pursuing his dream of becoming an actor. In 1952 he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art preparatory school Parada for a short time before being expelled. When he joined the army he discovered that he had a talent for singing and after his discharge from the army he joined a singing group called the George Mitchell singers. They appeared in a couple of stage plays but they didn't have the success they wanted. Gilmore soon gave up singing and continued his acting.\n\nPeter Gilmore died in London on 3 February 2013, aged 81.

{"id": "2105915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105915", "title": "Cub Scouts (Singapore Scout Association)", "text": "Cub Scouts (Singapore Scout Association)\n\nThe Cub Scouts are part of the Singapore Scout Association (SSA). They were earlierly known as \"Wolf Cubs\" in the pre-1966 era when Singapore Scouting was still under the jurisdiction of the Scout Association, UK (then known as the \"Imperial Headquarters\").\n\nSince the early days, little attention was paid to Cubbing. The first Wolf Cub Pack in Singapore was started in Outram Road School in 1925 with a single Wolf Cub Patrol led by one Mrs H.F. Duncanson of the 9th Singapore Troop. When the Japanese Scout Troop was formed later that year, a Wolf Cub Section was included in their infrastructure. In 1927, the 3rd Singapore Troop, an offshoot of the huge 4th Singapore (SJI) Troop, was dissolved and converted into a full-fledged Wolf Cub Pack within the 4th Troop's Structure. The 3rd Troop's name was subsequently assigned to the Oldham Hall Troop formed in 1928. \nThe Wolf Cub Section however began some time back, on 1 Jan 1914 at St Stephen's Westminster in Great Britain. Over the years, Wolf Cub Packs had begun to sprout up across the British Empire and by 1935, there were over 15,000 Packs with 275,000 Wolf Cubs and 22,000 Cubmasters. In November 1935, 10 years after the Wolf Cub Section was started in Singapore, 150 Wolf Cubs and 25 Officers made the Grand Wolf Cub's Rally and Campfire on the old race course in Singapore in a splendid celebration of the twenty-first anniversary of the Wolf Cub Section in the world. By that time, there were 13 Wolf Cub Packs in Singapore.\n\nThe Wolf Cub's Rally was led by Singapore District Scoutmaster Crickett and was lent a special note by the attendance of Fleet Scoutmaster Lawder, the Scout Commissioner for Malaya, Mr Frank Cooper Sands, the Assistant Commissioner for Malaya, Mr H.R. Cheeseman, the Chief Commissioner for Singapore Mr Cullen and the Assistant Chief Commissioner for Singapore, Rev. R. K. S. Adams.\n\nThe rally opened with the Grand Howl, the greeting of Welcome to Akela the Old Wolf, Lord Baden Powell; followed by a succession of enjoyable circle games, with each circle playing several games; jungle dances revealing a “play way” based on the romance of Rudyard Kipling's “Jungle Books”, the staging of the story of Mowgli, a play “Who stole the Jam?” by the 31st Pack, competitions and games with relay races (signaling, skipping and book balancing, ball catching and knots), the rallying to the “Birthday Feast” of the Cubs and finally concluding with the big Campfire.\n\nThe term \"Cadet Scouts\" was adopted when the first \"Policy, Organisation and Rules\" of (SSA) was promulgated in 1969, after following the changes introduced by the \"1966 Advance Party Report (APR)\" of the UK Scout Association. The name was changed again to \"Cub Scouts\" in 2005 to better reflect international usage.\n\nThe UK term \"\"Cub Scouts\"\" as proposed in the APR was however not adopted in 1969 although the entire progress badge scheme and proficiency badge scheme were embraced with minor amendments to the names. Progress badges were called the \"Standards\" instead of \"Arrows\", i.e. the Bronze Standard, Silver Standard and Gold Standard. The \"link badge\" was known as the \"District Commissioner's Award\", serving as the highest award for the Cadet Scout category. After 2000, the term \"Standards\" were again revised to \"Arrows\" and \"Cub Scout\" name has replaced that of \"Cadet Scout\". In 2005, the Singapore Scout Association has updated the Cub Scout Training Scheme, revising the syllabus and giving a new look to the designs of the progress badges. While the \"Arrows\" are retained, the top progress award is now known as the Akela Award (a wolf's head on a green background), replacing the \"link badge\" design of the UK.\n\nCub Scouts in Singapore follow a common Scout Promise and Law unlike the Wolf Cub era when they have a separate set of Cub Promise and Law. Cub Scouts are grouped in \"Sixes\" distinguished by coloured Turk's head woggles, where they are led by a \"Sixer\" and an \"Assistant Sixer\". If the situation calls for it, a \"Senior Sixer\" would also be appointed. The Cub Scout Leader leads the Cub Scout Unit (or \"Pack\") with the help of Assistant Cub Scout Leaders and the \"Sixers' Council\" composed of all the Sixers. At the Headquarters, National Cub Scout Commissioner presides over the Cub Scout Roundtable which oversee training and policy matters related to Cub Scouting.\n\nThe uniform of Cub Scouts in Singapore consists of a luminous-green jersey shirt, dark-green shorts, regulation national scarf/group scarf, Six woggle, regulation leather belt, olive-green socks, black shoes and the headdress. Notably, the headdress is the cap version (green with yellow-pipings) used since the inception of Wolf Cubs in the early 1910s. Prior to 1990, the uniform of Singapore's Cadet Scouts is khaki in colour, which was adopted in 1964.\n\nThe latest change to this section of Singapore Scouting was unveiled during the National Youth Programme Symposium held in July 2005 by the Singapore Scout Association, where the new name, \"Cub Scout\", was adopted together with the changes in the training scheme. Since that year minor amendments have been made to the way the top award was assessed.\n\nThe section is overseen by the Cub Scout Executive Committee (CubSEC) which is led by the National Cub Scout Commissioner.\nThe team is made up largely of teachers who are also experienced Cub Scout Leaders from various schools.\n\nWolf Cubs – youth under the age of twelve years of age who are being taught the first steps in discipline and good citizenship... the system is one of individual training and the numbers in a pack should not exceed 24.\n\nThere is a mistaken idea that Cubbing is, broadly speaking, junior Scouting. Although the principles underlying the Cub system are the same, the application varies to suit different ages. A Cub is never older than 12 years and the whole scheme of training is based on the romantic stories in Rudyard Kipling's immortal Jungle Books.\n\nThe atmosphere in which a Cub is trained is that of Mowgli, the Indian boy who was reared by wolves in the jungle – not a fairy tale for there are known cases in India of children having been cared for by these animals.\n\nMowgli was a small Indian boy who ran off into the jungle to hide from a tiger who had attacked his father's house. In the bushes of the jungle he met a grey wolf, a brave and kindly animal who picked him up gently in his mouth and carried him into his cave where he was taken care of by mother wolf.\n\nThe boy remained with the wolves and grew up as one of the family. He was taught the tricks of the jungle. Baloo the wise old brown bear taught him the law of the jungle while Bagheera the black panther taught him how to hunt and eventually become the best hunter in the jungle.\n\nMowgli became a member of the Seeonee Pack of wolves and he was taken to the council meeting of the wolves held at a great rock. Akela the old wolf, stood on this rock while the pack sat in a circle around it.\n\nWhen Akela took his place on the rock, the wolves threw up their heads and howled their welcome.\n\nLike Mowgli so is a wolf Cub tutored. He is given “bites” of everything important. As soon as he is admitted into a pack, the Cub is taught the principles of life. The method adopted is to educate him from within rather than to instruct him from without. He is educated mentally, morally and physically, or as the “Chief Old Wolf”, so aptly puts it, “to enthuse in the right direction.”\n\nTwo of the greatest inspirations of Baden Powell were the law and promise for the Cubs and the Grand Howl. On his investiture, a Cub makes a simple promise – he promises to do his best to do his duty to God and the Country, to keep the law of the Wolf Cub Pack and to do a good turn every day.\n\nThe Law he is taught also profoundly simple – the Cub gives in to the Old Wolf but he does not give in to himself. This obedience and self-discipline are inculcated. This Law appeals to the mind of a young boy. There are no imperatives.\n\nThe Grand Howl is a thing which stands by itself. “It gives expression to all kinds of queer emotions,” as a Cubmaster once put it, “loyalty to Akela the, Old Wolf, the sheer joy of being alive, thankfulness for Cubhood. Sorrow at the parting of trails.”\n\nBy games and romance young boys are kept usefully occupied, and their characters moulded so that they may later take their place as Scouts, having been introduced to and taught the spirit of the movement with its Law and Promise. Cub training is therefore not an end in itself. Success is often unseen but the reward comes later when a jolly little Cub is seen to have developed into a splendid Scout.\n\nOn my Honour I promise that I will do my best-\nTo do my duty to God and to the Republic of Singapore\nTo help other people and\nTo keep the Scout Law.\n\nA Scout is to be trusted.\nA Scout is loyal.\nA Scout makes friends, establishes and maintains harmonious relations.\nA Scout is disciplined and considerate.\nA Scout has courage in all difficulties.\n\n\"Our movement develops youth for purposeful and responsible adulthood, always prepared to serve God, country and humanity.\"\n\n"}

The name differentiates such systems from oil and steam systems. Historically, in large-scale commercial buildings such as high-rise and campus facilities, a hydronic system may include both a chilled and a heated water loop, to provide for both heating and air conditioning. Chillers and cooling towers are used either separately or together as means to provide water cooling, while boilers heat water. A recent innovation is the chiller boiler system, which provides an efficient form of HVAC for homes and smaller commercial spaces.\n\nMany larger cities have a district heating system that provides, through underground piping, publicly available high temperature hot water and chilled water. A building in the service district may be connected to these on payment of a service fee.\n\nHydronic systems are of two basic types:\n\nHydronic systems are classified in five ways:\n\nHydronic systems may be divided into several general piping arrangement categories:\n\nIn the oldest modern hydronic heating technology, a single-pipe steam system delivers steam to the radiators where the steam gives up its heat and is condensed back to water. The radiators and steam supply pipes are pitched so that gravity eventually takes this condensate back down through the steam supply piping to the boiler where it can once again be turned into steam and returned to the radiators.\n\nDespite its name, a radiator does not primarily heat a room by radiation. If positioned correctly a radiator will create an air convection current in the room, which will provide the main heat transfer mechanism. It is generally agreed that for the best results a steam radiator should be no more than one to two inches from a wall.\n\nSingle-pipe systems are limited in both their ability to deliver high volumes of steam (that is, heat) and the ability to control the flow of steam to individual radiators (because closing off the steam supply traps condensate in the radiators). Because of these limitations, single-pipe systems are no longer preferred.\n\nThese systems depend on the proper operation of thermostatic air-venting valves located on radiators throughout the heated area. When the system is not in use, these valves are open to the atmosphere, and radiators and pipes contain air. When a heating cycle begins, the boiler produces steam, which expands and displaces the air in the system. The air exits the system through the air-venting valves on the radiators and on the steam pipes themselves. The thermostatic valves close when they become hot; in the most common kind, the vapor pressure of a small amount of alcohol in the valve exerts the force to actuate the valve and prevent steam from leaving the radiator. When the valve cools, air enters the system to replace the condensing steam.\n\nSome more modern valves can be adjusted to allow for more rapid or slower venting. In general, valves nearest to the boiler should vent the slowest, and valves furthest from the boiler should vent the fastest. Ideally, steam should reach each valve and close each and every valve at the same time, so that the system can work at maximal efficiency; this condition is known as a \"balanced\" system.\n\nIn two-pipe steam systems, there is a return path for the condensate and it may involve pumps as well as gravity-induced flow. The flow of steam to individual radiators can be modulated using manual or automatic valves.\n\nThe return piping, as the name suggests, takes the most direct path back to the boiler.\n\nLow cost of return piping in most (but not all) applications, and the supply and return piping are separated.\n\nThis system can be difficult to balance due to the supply line being a different length than the return; the further the heat transfer device is from the boiler, the more pronounced the pressure difference. Because of this, it is always recommended to: minimize the distribution piping pressure drops; use a pump with a , include balancing and flow-measuring devices at each terminal or branch circuit; and use control valves with a at the terminals.\n\nThe two-pipe reverse return configuration which is sometimes called 'the three-pipe system' is different to the two-pipe system in the way that water returns to the boiler. In a two-pipe system, once the water has left the first radiator, it returns to the boiler to be reheated, and so with the second and third etc. With the two-pipe reverse return, the return pipe travels to the last radiator in the system before returning to the boiler to be reheated.\n\nThe advantage with the two-pipe reverse return system is that the pipe run to each radiator is about the same, this ensures that the frictional resistance to the flow of water in each radiator is the same. This allows easy balancing of the system.\n\nThe installer or repair person cannot trust that every system is self-balancing without properly testing it.\n\nModern systems almost always use heated water rather than steam. This opens the system to the possibility of also using chilled water to provide air conditioning.\n\nIn homes, the water loop may be as simple as a single pipe that \"loops\" the flow through every radiator in a zone. In such a system, flow to the individual radiators cannot be modulated as all of the water is flowing through every radiator in the zone. Slightly more complicated systems use a \"main\" pipe that flows uninterrupted around the zone; the individual radiators tap off a small portion of the flow in the main pipe. In these systems, individual radiators can be modulated. Alternatively, a number of loops with several radiators can be installed, the flow in each loop or zone controlled by a zone valve connected to a thermostat.\n\nIn most water systems, the water is circulated by means of one or more circulator pumps. This is in marked contrast to steam systems where the inherent pressure of the steam is sufficient to distribute the steam to remote points in the system. A system may be broken up into individual heating \"zones\" using either multiple circulator pumps or a single pump and electrically operated zone valves.\n\nThere have been considerable improvements in the efficiency and therefore the operating costs of a hydronic heating system with the introduction of insulating products.\n\nRadiator Panel system pipes are covered with a fire rated, flexible and lightweight elastomeric rubber material designed for thermal insulation. Slab Heating efficiency is improved with the installation of a thermal barrier made of foam. There are now many product offerings on the market with different energy ratings and installation methods.\n\nMost hydronic systems require balancing. This involves measuring and setting the flow to achieve an optimal distribution of energy in the system.\nIn a balanced system every radiator gets just enough hot water to allow it to heat up fully.\n\nResidential systems may use ordinary tap water, but sophisticated commercial systems often add various chemicals to the system water. For example, these added chemicals may:\n\nAll hydronic systems must have a means to eliminate air from the system. A properly designed, air-free system should continue to function normally for many years.\n\nAir causes irritating system noises, as well as interrupting proper heat transfer to and from the circulating fluids. In addition, unless reduced below an acceptable level, the oxygen dissolved in water causes corrosion. This corrosion can cause rust and scale to build up on the piping. Over time these particles can become loose and travel around the pipes, reducing or even blocking the flow as well as damaging pump seals and other components.\n\nWater-loop systems can also experience air problems. Air found within hydronic water-loop systems may be classified into three forms:\n\nVarious devices such as manual and automatic air vents are used to address free air which floats up to the high points throughout the system. Automatic air vents contain a valve that is operated by a float. When air is present, the float drops, allowing the valve to open and bleed air out. When water reaches (fills) the valve, the float lifts, blocking the water from escaping. Small (domestic) versions of these valves in older systems are sometimes fitted with a Schrader-type air valve fitting, and any trapped, now-compressed air can be bled from the valve by manually depressing the valve stem until water rather than air begins to emerge.\n\nEntrained air is air bubbles that travel around in the piping at the same velocity as the water. Air \"scoops\" are one example of products which attempt to remove this type of air.\n\nDissolved air is also present in the system water and the amount is determined principally by the temperature and pressure (see Henry's Law) of the incoming water. On average, tap water contains between 8-10% dissolved air by volume.\n\nRemoval of dissolved, free and entrained air can only be achieved with a high-efficiency air elimination device that includes a coalescing medium that continually scrubs the air out of the system. Tangential or centrifugal style air separator devices are limited to removal of free and entrained air only.\n\nWater expands as it heats and contracts as it cools. A water-loop hydronic system must have one or more expansion tanks in the system to accommodate this varying volume of the working fluid. These tanks often use a rubber diaphragm pressurised with compressed air. The expansion tank accommodates the expanded water by further air compression and helps maintain a roughly constant pressure in the system across the expected change in fluid volume. Simple cisterns open to atmospheric pressure are also used.\n\nHydronic systems are usually connected to a water supply (such as the public water supply). An automatic valve regulates the amount of water in the system and also prevents backflow of system water (and any water treatment chemicals) into the water supply.\n\nExcessive heat or pressure may cause the system to fail. At least one combination over-temperature and over-pressure relief valve is always fitted to the system to allow the steam or water to vent to the atmosphere in case of the failure of some mechanism (such as the boiler temperature control) rather than allowing the catastrophic bursting of the piping, radiators, or boiler. The relief valve usually has a manual operating handle to allow testing and the flushing of contaminants (such as grit) that may cause the valve to leak under otherwise-normal operating conditions.\n\n\n"}

In 2005, on his first trip to Bali, Stephens was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar with of heroin taped to his chest and concealed under his clothing. After a criminal trial, on 14 February 2006 Stephens was sentenced to life imprisonment. His appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the sentence reduced to 10 years was rejected in January 2011.\n\nStephens, from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong, New South Wales, was employed at Eurest, a catering company, where he met Renae Lawrence, Matthew Norman, and his supervisor, Andrew Chan. All four would later be convicted of drug trafficking as fellow members of the Bali Nine.\n\nAccording to media reports based on the testimony of Renae Lawrence, acting under the instructions of Andrew Chan, Stephens and Lawrence departed Australia on 6 April 2005. The day before, Stephens, Lawrence, and Si Yi Chen met with Myuran Sukumaran where police allege drug smuggling tools such as sealable plastic bags, medical tape, elastic waist bands and skin tight bike shorts were stuffed into the bags of Stephens and Lawrence. Lawrence claimed she was given cash; whilst Stephens claimed that his life was threatened. Media reports claim that police records show that whilst in Bali, Lawrence was in daily contact with Chan until 13 April, when Chan changed his mobile phone number. On the same day, he instructed Stephens and Lawrence, staying at the Kuta Laguna, to change hotels. Together with Chen and Norman, Stephens and Lawrence checked into the Adhi Dharma hotel on 14 April. Indonesian police were in an adjacent room in the same hotel. Nguyen arrived on 16 April, and booked into the same hotel. The original planned departure date of 14 April from Bali was delayed as Chan suspected Australian and Indonesian police were aware of his plans.\n\nOn 17 April, Chen, Norman, and Nguyen checked out of the Adhi Dharma hotel, leaving Stephens and Lawrence in the hotel until they departed for the airport.\n\nStephens was arrested by Indonesian police on 17 April 2005 at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Heroin weighing was discovered strapped to his legs and chest, concealed underneath his clothing. Scott Rush, Michael Czugaj and Lawrence were arrested at the same time as Stephens. On 20 April 2005, graphic footage of the arrests and subsequent police questioning of Stephens and other members of the Bali Nine was aired on Australian television.\n\nOn the same day that Stephens was arrested, Indonesian police also arrested Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, Myuran Sukumaran and Matthew Norman at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Alleged co-ringleader, Andrew Chan was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession.\n\nAt the time of the arrest, it was reported that Stephens, speaking with Lawrence, was recorded as saying \"\"Should we dob them in?\"\"\nLawrence replied:\nLee Rush, the father of Scott Rush, a fellow member of the Bali Nine, said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying:\nRush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney-General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006.\n\nCriminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen, and Norman, all arrested at the Melasti Hotel and earning the numeric epithet, \"The Melasti Three\", were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately.\n\nIn December 2005, as the trials began, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Australian Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment;. Lawyers acting for Stephens claimed that the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians should be prepared for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty.\n\nDuring his trial, Stephens claims he was forced by Chan to travel to Bali and proceed with the smuggling. Stephens claims that Chan showed him photographs of his family going about their daily lives, and saying they would be killed if he did not cooperate, saying:\nAdnan Wirawan, Stephens' lawyer, claimed that his client has been unfairly accused as the ring leader of the alleged conspiracy. \"He's a human suitcase... he was being told what to do.\" During legal proceedings, Czugaj and Rush, fellow members of the Bali Nine who have since been convicted of drug trafficking, testified that they had never met Stephens or Lawrence until they were all arrested on 17 April 2005.\n\nSentences for the majority of the Bali Nine were handed down on 13 February 2006 and 14 February 2006. As Stephens' sentence was about to be handed down, his mother Michelle, speaking from Bali, was reported as saying:\nOn 14 February 2006, Stephens was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nCommenting on the sentences at the time, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty stated:\nThe Australian Prime Minister John Howard was reported as commenting:\nAs verdicts and sentences were handed down in the trials of the Bali Nine, additional arrests were made in Australia.\n\nStephens, along with eight other members of the Bali Nine, appealed the severity of their sentence. On 26 April 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court reduced the life imprisonment sentences to 20-years for each of Lawrence, Nguyen, Chen, Czugaj and Norman, all arrested at Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Stephens' appeal was upheld.\n\nOn December 2009, Stephens announced he planned to marry Christine Winarni Puspayanti, an Indonesian woman he met at Kerobokan Prison. Stephens met Puspayanti months after his arrest while she was visiting the prison as a part of a church group; and they married in a traditional Indonesian-style wedding in April 2011. \n\nIn 2014, Stephens and Nguyen were transferred to a prison in Malang, East Java when it was reported that they had violated prison rules.\n\n"}

The park was formally opened on 3 August 1895 by local politician Will Crooks.\n\nThe waterside park is notable for its spectacular cross-river view of the classical buildings of the former Greenwich Hospital, the \"Cutty Sark\" and the National Maritime Museum, with Greenwich Park forming a backdrop. The northern entrance of the Greenwich foot tunnel is also within the park. It is almost certain that the view from this location is the one that the Canaletto painting 'Greenwich Hospital from the North Bank of the Thames' is taken from, though whether Canaletto himself actually visited the site is in doubt.\n\nThe park also gave its name to Island Gardens DLR station. This opened in 1987 as the southern terminus of the DLR's initial system, and was an elevated terminal station situated to the west of the park. The later construction of the DLR extension to Lewisham involved a tunnel under the Thames, and Island Gardens station was relocated about north, close to the northern entrance to the tunnel by Millwall Park. The new station is largely underground; the original elevated station was demolished.\n"}

It is the second-largest ski area in Lake Tahoe after Heavenly, with 30 chairlifts, and the only funitel in the U.S. Since Squaw Valley joined forces with Alpine Meadows in 2012, the resorts offer joint access to , 43 lifts and over 270 trails. The resort attracts approximately 600,000 skiers a year.\n\nLocated west of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada with a base of and a skiable across six peaks, the resort tops out at at Granite Chief. Not far from Donner Pass, the area receives heavy maritime snowfall, frequently receiving or more in a winter.\n\nA scenic aerial tramway rises to High Camp at an elevation of above sea level. At High Camp, tourists have access to the facilities of Squaw Valley, including a pool, roller skating, dining, shopping, and high-altitude disc golf.\n\nSquaw Valley is home to several annual summer events. The resort brings in accomplished yoga teachers and many well-known musical performers every July, and has for forty-five years provided the summer premises of the Squaw Valley Community of Writers. Summer also welcomes a wide array of concerts and beer and wine events including the Brews, Jazz and Funk Fest, Peaks and Paws and Bluesdays.\n\nRon Cohen is the resort's COO after the departure of Andrew Wirth.\n\nFormer University of Nevada star skier, Wayne Poulsen, purchased the first of Squaw Valley Ski Resort from the Southern Pacific Railroad. Poulsen already had a history in the area: in 1931, he had placed third at an Olympic trials at Granlibakken in Tahoe City. Shortly after, Poulsen met Harvard alumnus and trained lawyer Alex Cushing, who brought capital, political connections, and increased access to the project. Cushing had fallen in love with Lake Tahoe after a visit to the Sierra Nevada in 1946. After a disagreement over the resort's future, Cushing gained control of the project and became the chairman of Squaw Valley Ski Corporation. The resort opened in 1949, and Cushing remained its chairman until his death.\n\nCushing modeled the resort after European ski destinations. He re-engineered the model of traditional U.S. ski resort by locating a swimming pool, ice rink, roller disco, and restaurants on the mountain instead of at the base. His designs also brought the most advanced lift technology to the U.S. for the first time. When Squaw Valley opened, its Squaw One lift was deemed the longest double chairlift in the world.\n\nSquaw Valley's enormous success can be largely attributed to the visibility that came from hosting the 1960 Winter Olympics, a direct result of Cushing's effort and determination. During the planning stages of the 1960 Olympics, Innsbruck, Austria, was the leading choice for the Olympic site. In 1955, however, Cushing secured the bid after winning over the International Olympic Committee in Paris with a scale model of his planned Olympic site. The Winter Olympics in 1960 were the first to be televised live, making the games accessible to millions of viewers in real-time. The event signaled the rise of U.S. skiing to the level of world-famous European skiing, and Squaw Valley's preparedness for the games showed the international community that U.S. ski resorts offered world-class facilities.\n\nSquaw Valley hosted World Cup races in 1969 with four technical events: slalom and giant slalom for both men and women. American Billy Kidd won the men's slalom, followed by U.S. teammates Rick Chaffee (4th) and Spider Sabich (10th) of Kyburz. The 1969 season saw a record snowpack at Squaw Valley; and over of new snow cancelled the downhills. After an absence of 48 years, women's technical races returned in 2017 and overall leader Mikaela Shiffrin of Colorado won both events.\n\nIn 1978, Squaw Valley experienced one of the worst cable car accidents in history. On a stormy afternoon late in the season on Saturday, 15 April, the Tram came off of one of its cables, dropped and then bounced back up, colliding with a cable which sheared through the car; four were killed and 31 injured.\n\nSquaw Valley was purchased by private equity group KSL Capital Partners in November 2010. A year later, Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows Ski Resort merged under the new umbrella leadership of Squaw Valley Ski Holdings, LLC. The new company operates as one, with joint lift tickets and single season passes for visitors and free shuttles between its locations, but preserves the individuality of the two resorts. In 2017, KSL Capital, in partnership with Aspen/Snowmass (Henry Crown and Company), formed Alterra Mountain Company, which then became the primary owner of Squaw Valley.\n\nSquaw Valley was designated a California Historical Landmark in 1960 during the Olympic Games. The area was dubbed the Pioneer Ski Area of America, commemorating 100 years of skiing in nearby Sierra Nevada mining towns that were the first U.S. locations where organized skiing took place.\n\n\nAnnual snowfall at Squaw Valley can surpass 500 inches.\n\nIn September 2011, Alpine Meadows Ski Resort and Squaw Valley Ski Resort announced their intention to merge ownership. The merger united the two popular ski destinations under common management by Squaw's Valley's parent company, KSL Capital Partners, LLC. Alpine Meadow's parent, JMA Ventures, holds a minority stake. The new umbrella entity for both resorts is known as Squaw Valley Ski Holdings, LLC. Squaw Valley Ski Holdings, LLC seeks to connect the two resorts with a \"Base-to-Base\" gondola. Resort owners need permission from local land managers, including Placer County and the Tahoe National Forest who are currently studying the proposed project's environmental impacts. A number of conservation organizations, including Sierra Watch and the Sierra Club, consider the proposed gondola a threat to Granite Chief Wilderness. This proposed combination is supported by White Wolf Mountain owner Troy Caldwell.\n\nIn 2016, Squaw Valley Ski Holdings submitted a final application for entitlements for its proposed Village at Squaw Valley Specific Plan, a $1billion plan that prompted the Attorney General of California to write a letter of concern to Placer County. The plan would include 850 hotel and condominium units and a 96-foot-tall \"Mountain Adventure Camp\" featuring a year-round indoor waterpark. According to the environmental review for the project, new development is projected to add 3,300 new car trips to local roads on peak days, and the project would have twenty \"significant but unavoidable\" impacts\".\n\nSierra Watch created a grassroots campaign to “Keep Squaw True”, holding public events and circulating an on-line petition in opposition to KSL Capital Partners' proposed expansion plan.\n\nIn November 2016, the Placer County Board of Supervisors approved KSL's controversial development proposal in spite of opposition from local conservation organizations, including Sierra Watch. Sierra Watch filed suit to overturn those approvals for violating the California Environmental Quality Act in December 2016.\n\nIn 2017, resort owners added a roller coaster to their development proposal.\n\nThe Lake Tahoe area is located on the border between California and Nevada. The area centers around Lake Tahoe itself, the second deepest lake in the U.S., which was voted America's \"Best Lake\" in 2012 by The USA Today.

The school district is the seventh largest public school system in the state of Texas and third largest within the Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown Metropolitan Area. The school district is currently the largest employer in Fort Bend County with more than 9,000 district employees, and encompasses some of the wealthiest locales in the State of Texas.\n\nFort Bend ISD is distinguished by its honors. In 2010, the school district was rated \"recognized\" by the Texas Education Agency.\n\nThe district is the only school district in the nation to be named a 2011 National School District of Character by the National Schools of Character Program in Washington DC—and only one of two districts in Texas to be honored with this designation. The Washington Post ranked Clements, Austin, Kempner, Travis, Dulles, Hightower and Elkins High Schools as seven of the Top 2011 High Schools in the Nation.\n\nFort Bend ISD was formed when Sugar Land ISD and Missouri City ISD merged after an election on April 18, 1959. The first superintendent was Louis P. Rodgers (died May 1967). Missouri City ISD was formed from Missouri City Common School, House Common School and Mustang Common School (Fresno area). Sugar Land ISD was formed in 1918 and was expanded by adding Sartartia Common School and Clodine Common School in 1948.\n\nOriginally FBISD was racially segregated, with white high school students attending the consolidated Dulles High School, with its permanent campus in Sugar Land, and black high school students attending M.R. Wood School in Sugar Land. In 1963, FBISD had 600 students. The school district desegregated in September 1965; in the post-desegregation period Dulles was the district's sole high school until Willowridge High School opened in 1979. In 1969 the school district had 1,000 students, and its enrollment was increasing. Between 1979 and 1997, a new high school opened at intervals no more than five years apart. The district became the fastest growing school district in the State of Texas. In August 1997 the district had over 14,000 students at its high schools, then numbering six.\n\nA portion of Stafford was formerly a part of Fort Bend ISD, but it broke away and formed the Stafford Municipal School District. In 1977, the FBISD portions of the city of Stafford left FBISD for the Stafford MSD, and the move was found to be constitutional in 1981. Residents in Stafford's ETJ are served by Fort Bend ISD, not Stafford MSD.\n\nCirca 1997 FBISD was the fastest-growing school district in Texas, with new comprehensive high schools opening in increments of fewer than five years.\n\nThe Fort Bend ISD Police Department is headquartered in Stafford. Its current headquarters was the former FBISD Administration Building located off FM1092 which was later converted into a vehicle maintenance facility after the administration HQ was moved to Sugar Land.\n\nFBISD's current administration building is located in Sugar Land, near the Town Square and First Colony Mall. There is also the FBISD Annex, which contains an auditorium/banquet hall for FBISD, as well as a shop for teachers of FBISD.\n\nIn 2019 the FBISD administration stated that it was considering changing the class ranking system so that students are ranked according to the school's attendance zones in which they reside instead of the schools which they actually attend.\n\nFBISD is known for having some of the best athletic teams in Houston. All 11 high schools contain 2 gyms, Tennis Courts, a football/soccer/track field, a baseball field, and softball field, each fitted with LED scoreboards.\n\nFBISD also manages 2 athletic complexes, complete with turf and Video/LED scoreboards from NEVCO:\n\nLouis P. Rodgers Memorial Auditorium in Dulles High School was built in 1969.\n\nSeventy percent of the district's campuses received an Exemplary or Recognized rating from the Texas Education Agency in 2002. That same year, the district was named a Recognized District by the Texas Education Agency for the second consecutive year, making it one of the largest public school districts in Texas to receive that rating. Currently the district is ranked \"academically acceptable\" and has been for the last several years.\n\nAustin High School and Clements High School, both in Sugar Land, have been recognized by \"Texas Monthly\" magazine in its list of the top 10 high schools in the state of Texas. In addition, Clements, Austin, and Elkins high schools ranked 313th, 626th, and 702nd, respectively, among the top 1000 schools in the United States by \"Newsweek\".\n\nFort Bend ISD has been named one of the top 100 School Districts in the Nation for a Fine Arts Education, according to a nationwide survey of public and private school programs.\n\nThe current Superintendent is Charles E. Dupre who was hired in 2013 after Dr. Jenney retired and left. Dupre previously served in Pflugerville Independent School District. In June 2008, the University Council for Education Administration, housed at the University of Texas at Austin, awarded Dupre the Excellence in Education Leadership Award for his dedication to improving the training and development of school leaders.\n\nFBISD is served by a board of trustees who are periodically elected. Each trustee represents one of the seven regions in the school district.\n\n\n\n\n\nFort Bend ISD opened several magnet programs to foster small learning communities with a career based focus. Several Academies are housed at different schools and are magnet programs that require an application. The District provides busing throughout the district for Academy students, irrespective of which school they choose to attend, located at their zoned Elementary Campus (or another location deemed appropriate by staff/parents).

It was written by Dickinson, Donald Bull, and Alan Hyman, adapted from a 1939 novel by Leonard Gribble.\n\nThe film is a murder mystery set, as the title suggests, at the Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, London, then the home of Arsenal Football Club, who were at the time one of the dominant teams in English football. The backdrop is a friendly match between Arsenal and The Trojans, a fictitious amateur side. One of the Trojans' players drops dead during the match and when it is revealed he has been poisoned, suspicion falls on his teammates as well as his former mistress. Detective Inspector Slade (Leslie Banks) is called in to solve the crime.\n\n\nThe film stars several Arsenal players and members of staff such as Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, although only manager George Allison has a speaking part. The Trojans' body doubles on the pitch were players from Brentford, filmed during the First Division fixture between the two sides on 6 May 1939; this was the last match of the 1938–39 season and Arsenal's last official league fixture before the outbreak of the Second World War.\nBrentford’s players wore white shirts for the match because their first choice red and white stripes would have clashed with Arsenal's red and white jerseys.

He is noted for his carefully arranged fabricated photographs (called \"fictions\"), various candid series, a satirical edge, dark humor, and long-standing criticism of what he describes as leftist twaddle.\n\nLes Krims was born in Brooklyn, New York. Krims studied at New York's Stuyvesant High School. Richard Ben-Veniste (\"Benti,\" as he was called in home-room at Stuyvesant), famous for prosecuting Richard Nixon, and A.D. Coleman, the former photography critic for The New York Times, were two of Krims' Stuyvesant classmates. Krims studied art at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, and Pratt Institute. For the last 42 years he has taught photography, first at the Rochester Institute of Technology, and for the last 40 years at Buffalo State College, where he is a professor in the Department of Fine Arts. In describing his staged pictures, and the parodies of candid journalistic propaganda photographs he makes, Krims said, \"It is possible to create any picture one imagines.\" Krims's latest project is a website (leskrims.com) where he sells archival ink jet prints of a wide selection of his pictures. Krims claims new digital printing technology and capitalism make it possible to \"own the means of production, rendering moot wall-to-wall delusional Marxist posturing in the culture community.\"\n\nLes Krims has published numerous offset works. Two of these, \"Fictcryptokrimsographs,\" and \"Making Chicken Soup,\" were published by Humpy Press, which he founded and incorporated in the mid-1970s, and has since been dissolved. Krims has also published original print portfolios such as, \"Idiosyncratic Pictures,\" and \"Porsch Rainbows.\" Most recently (November 2005), a Photo Poche monograph, \"Les Krims,\" edited by Robert Delpire, with an introduction by Bernard Noel, was published by Actes Sud, in France.\n\nIn \"The Little People of America\" (1971), Krims received permission to photograph people belonging to a national organization founded by the actor Billy Barty, called \"The Little People of America.\" Many of the pictures were made at national conventions of the L.P.A, in Oakland, CA, and Atlanta, GA. Krims sought to show that the people he photographed were brave, normal people, having more in common with the Mid-West than the Upper-West-Side, unlike the way the dwarf was portrayed in the history of art or contemporary photographs.\n\nIn his portfolio \"The Deerslayers\" (1972), Krims took pictures of deer hunters who had voluntarily stopped at \"deer check stations\" so that NYS conservationists could examine the general health of the deer. Pictured posing with their kills, Krims suggested the hunters had much in common with performance art, and odd manifestations of sculpture. He also attempted to underscore the American nature and long tradition of deer hunting as one aspect of a criticism of animal rights and anti-Vietnam War activists.\n\nIn \"The Incredible Case Of The Stack O'Wheat Murders\" (1972), Krims both parodies forensic photography, and points to it as a remarkable archive of incredible and moving images (the various, successful television series attests to his prescience). In each \"Wheats\" crime scene, a Stack O'Wheats (pancakes) is placed near each \"victim\" (he used friends and family to pose for the pictures). Each stack is topped with pats of butter and syrup, the number of pancakes in the stack signifying the number of the crime. Hershey's chocolate syrup was used to simulate blood in the photos, which was formed into words and celestial shapes. Krims originally included 8 ounces of Hershey's syrup in a heat sealed plastic bag with the original print portfolio, as well as \"enough pancake mix to make one complete Stack O' Wheats\".\n\nIn \"Making Chicken Soup\" (1972), Krims published pictures of his mother preparing her traditional chicken soup recipe, while nude. These pictures were published as a small book, some say giving rise years later to the popular Chicken Soup series. The book contained a dedication, which underscored the real point of the satire: \"This book is dedicated to my mother and concerned photographers, both make chicken soup.\" Krims felt that \"socially concerned\" photography was a palliative, just as chicken soup was—in the long run, an ineffective remedy for serious disease.\n\nIn \"Fictocryptokrimsographs,\" published in 1975, Krims used a Polaroid SX-70 camera to make a series of 40, titled pictures. The SX-70 was chosen, because of the ability to literally move and work the not yet dry, viscous, film emulsion much like paint after the picture developed. Included are various odd and humorous pictures, which are often puns or parodies of fashion trends.\n\nKrims has also steadily been adding pictures to an overarching project spanning three decades called, \"The Decline of the Left.\"\n\nHe is sometimes displayed in exhibition in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nIn 2004, he had a two-month exhibition at Laurence Miller Gallery in NYC titled \"Fictions 1969-1974\". In 2007, he had a retrospective at Galerie Baudoin Lebon in Paris and has been part of a dozen other group exhibitions of photography in the years 2000-2007 with others planned.\n\n\n"}

It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Radovljica. \n\nThe town is located on the southern slope of the Karawanks mountain range, about of Lake Bled at the confluence of the Sava Dolinka and the Sava Bohinjka, both headwaters of the Sava River. It lies at the southern end of the Radovljica Plain (, also known as \"Dežela\").\n\nRadovljica station is a stop on the Tarvisio–Ljubljana Railway line.\n\nThe settlement around a church built at the behest of the Patriarchs of Aquileia in the March of Carniola was first mentioned in a 1296 deed, it received market rights from Duke Henry of Carinthia in 1333. In the 14th century it was held by the Carinthian Counts of Ortenburg, was inherited by the Counts of Celje in 1418, and, upon the death of Count Ulrich II of Celje in 1456, fell to the Habsburg Emperor Frederick III. \n\nWith the Duchy of Carniola, Radovljica was incorporated into the Inner Austrian lands of the Habsburg Monarchy and received city rights. From 1867 until 1918, the town's post office used the bilingual name \"Radmannsdorf – Radovljica\". The town was in the Cisleithanian (Austrian) side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the Compromise of 1867 and the administrative capital of a district of the same name, one of the 11 \"Bezirkshauptmannschaften\" in the crown land of Carniola.\n\nRadovljica is the site of a concealed grave associated with the Second World War. The Andrejc Field Mass Grave () is located in a meadow in the middle of a back-filled trench west of the settlement, between the road to Lesce and the railroad. It contains the remains of two unidentified prisoners from the former prison in Radovljica.\n\nThe Apiculture Museum () in Radovljica is dedicated to the history of beekeeping in Slovenia. It is housed in a Baroque mansion in the historic center of the town. Founded in 1959, the museum was later incorporated into the Radovljica Municipal Museum. It displays Slovenia's rich beekeeping tradition, an important agricultural activity in the 18th and 19th centuries. Among the exhibitions are traditional beehives and beekeeping tools, the life and work of local beekeepers, and decorative painted beehive panels as unique examples of Slovenian folk art. A bust and copies of books written by the Slovenian beekeeper Anton Janša (1734–1773) are also on display.\n\nThe Gingerbread Museum () is a pastry shop dedicated to decorative hard gingerbread (i.e., \"Lebkuchenherzen\"), handmade from a honey-based dough mostly shaped into hearts of various size. It is located in a historical house in the old town center of Radovljica. The bakery's workshop is located in the basement, where women in traditional costume show how to bake gingerbread with historical tools and equipment. A café is located on the ground floor.\n\nNotable people that were born or lived in Radovljica include:\n\n"}

{"id": "2106011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106011", "title": "Pathosystem", "text": "Pathosystem\n\nA pathosystem is a subsystem of an ecosystem and is defined by the phenomenon of parasitism. A plant pathosystem is one in which the host species is a plant. The parasite is any species in which the individual spends a significant part of its lifespan inhabiting one host individual and obtaining nutrients from it. The parasite may thus be an insect, mite, nematode, parasitic Angiosperm, fungus, bacterium, mycoplasma, virus or viroid. Other consumers, however, such as mammalian and avian herbivores, which graze populations of plants, are normally considered to be outside the conceptual boundaries of the plant pathosystem.\n\nA host has the property of resistance to a parasite. And a parasite has the property of parasitic ability on a host. Parasitism is the interaction of these two properties. The main feature of the pathosystem concept is that it concerns parasitism, and it is not concerned with the study of either the host or parasite on its own. Another feature of the pathosystem concept is that the parasitism is studied in terms of populations, at the higher levels and in ecologic aspects of the system. The pathosystem concept is also multidisciplinary. It brings together various crop science disciplines such as entomology, nematology, plant pathology, and plant breeding. It also applies to wild populations and to agricultural, horticultural, and forest crops, and to tropical, subtropical, as well as both subsistence and commercial farming.\n\nIn a wild plant pathosystem, both the host and the parasite populations exhibit genetic diversity and genetic flexibility. Conversely, in a crop pathosystem, the host population normally exhibits genetic uniformity and genetic inflexibility (i.e., clones, pure lines, hybrid varieties), and the parasite population assumes a comparable uniformity. This distinction means that a wild pathosystem can respond to selection pressures, but that a crop pathosystem does not. It also means that a system of locking (see below) can function in a wild plant pathosystem but not in a crop pathosystem.\n\nPathosystem balance means that the parasite does not endanger the survival of the host; and that the resistance in the host does not endanger the survival of the parasite. This is self-evident from the evolutionary survival of wild plant pathosystems, as systems, during periods of geological time.\n\nThe gene-for-gene relationship is an approximate botanical equivalent of antigens and antibodies in mammals. For each resistance gene in the host, there is a corresponding, or matching, gene in the parasite. When the genes of the parasite match those of the host, the resistance does not operate.\n\nThere are two kinds of resistance to parasites in plants:\n\n\nInfection is the contact made by one parasite individual with one host individual for the purposes of parasitism. There are two kinds of infection:\n\n\nAn epidemic is the growth of a parasite population which is made at the expense of the host population. There are two kinds of epidemic:\n\n\nThe n/2 model (pronounced either ‘en over two’ or 'half en') suggests the mode of operation of the gene-for-gene relationship in a wild plant pathosystem. It apparently functions as a system of locking in which every host and parasite individual has half of the genes in the gene-for-gene relationship (i.e., n/2 genes, where n is the total number of pairs of genes in that relationship). Each gene in the host is the equivalent of a tumbler in a mechanical lock, and each gene in the parasite is the equivalent of a notch on a mechanical key. Provided that each n/2 combination of genes occurs with an equal frequency, and with a random distribution, in both the host and parasite populations, the frequency of matching allo-infections will be reduced to the minimum. For example, with six pairs of genes, each host and parasite individual would have three genes, and there would be twenty different locks and keys; with a twelve-gene system, there would be 924 six-gene locks and keys. Given an equal frequency and a random distribution of every lock and key, the frequency of matching allo-infection would be 1/20 and 1/924, respectively. These figures are obtained from the binomial expansion illustrated by Pascal's triangle.\n\nThis system of locking cannot function in a crop pathosystem in which the host population has genetic uniformity. A crop pathosystem is usually the equivalent of every door in the town having the same lock, and every householder having the same key which fits every lock. A system of locking is ruined by uniformity, and this is exactly what we have achieved when protecting our genetically uniform crops with vertical resistance. It also explains why vertical resistance is temporary resistance in agriculture. This type of error is called sub-optimization and it results from working at too low a systems level. The system of locking is an emergent property that is observable only at the systems level of the pathosystem. Comparable biological emergents are the schooling of fish, and the flocking of birds, which cannot be observed at any systems level below that of the population. The n/2 model is also the most important hypothesis to emanate from the concept of the pathosystem. It can also be argued that the gene-for-gene relationship must function on a basis of heterogeneity in the wild pathosystem because the gross instability of the 'boom and bust' of modern plant breeding would have no evolutionary survival value.\n\nA gene-for-gene relationship can evolve only in a discontinuous pathosystem. This is because it functions as a system of locking. A matching allo-infection is the equivalent of a lock being unlocked. With the end of the season, all matched (i.e., unlocked) host tissues disappear. With the onset of a new growing season, all discontinuous host tissue (e.g., new leaves of a deciduous tree, newly germinated annual seedlings, or newly emerged tissue of a perennial herb) is unmatched and each host individual has a vertical resistance that is functioning. This is the equivalent of re-locking. This alternation of matching and non-matching (or unlocking and re-locking) is an essential feature of any system of locking, and it is possible only in a discontinuous pathosystem. Conversely, in a continuous pathosystem just one matching allo-infection on each host individual is required for that individual to be parasitised for the rest of its life which, in the case of some evergreen trees, may endure for centuries. A gene-for-gene relationship is useless in such a pathosystem and, consequently, it will not evolve.\n\nCrops that are derived from a continuous wild pathosystem (e.g., aroids, banana, cassava, citrus, cocoa, coconut, date palm, ginger, mango, oil palm, olive, papaya, pineapple, pyrethrum, sisal, sugarcane, sweet potato, tea, turmeric, vanilla, yams) have no gene-for-gene relationships, not withstanding a few erroneous reports to the contrary.\n\nHorizontal resistance is the resistance that invariably remains after a matching allo-infection has occurred. To postulate that horizontal resistance does not occur would be to postulate an absolute susceptibility. Such a level of susceptibility is experimentally unproved, and is theoretically impossible. Horizontal resistance is polygenically inherited and it can be exhibited at any level between its minimum and its maximum. Its maximum level should provide a virtually complete control of a parasite under conditions of maximum epidemiological competence. Breeding for comprehensive horizontal resistance will require simultaneous quantitative improvements and will eventually control all the parasites that have epidemiological competence in a particular agro-ecosystem. (5). However, because epidemiological competence is so variable, a cultivar that is in balance with one agro-ecosystem, is likely to be unbalanced in another agro-ecosystem, having too much resistance to some parasites and too little to others.\n\nOf particular importance is the concept of parasite interference, first defined by Vanderplank, who called it the cryptic error in field trials. Parasite interference does not affect the demonstration of vertical resistance, but it can totally destroy the evidence for high levels of horizontal resistance. This factor, which has only recently been recognised, largely explains the almost total neglect of horizontal resistance during the twentieth century.\n\nThe greater the area of a uniform host population with a single vertical resistance, the more dangerous that resistance becomes. This is because of an increased selection pressure for the matching parasite, and an increased loss when the matching does occur. The greater the area of uniformity of vertical resistance, therefore, the greater the danger. Conversely, the greater the area of a uniform host population with high horizontal resistances, the more effective the horizontal resistance becomes. This is because parasite interference declines as the area of a horizontally resistant host population increases, and it is least when the entire crop of a region has a high level of horizontal resistance in all of its cultivars. The greater the area of uniformity of horizontal resistance, therefore, the greater the security.\n\nIn breeding crop plants for horizontal resistance to their parasites, the disciplines of plant breeding, plant pathology, and crop entomology should be regarded as being amalgamated into a single discipline.\n"}

After Sharon Tate and several others were murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969, Doris Tate began working to raise public awareness about the U.S. corrections system. She was influential in a court decision that amended California criminal laws relating to the rights of victims of violent crime.\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, Tate was the second daughter of Dorris W. Willett and his wife, Fannie R. Leuch. She had a sister, Genevieve. Doris was a housewife and mother of three daughters. In 1969, her eldest daughter, Sharon, was at the beginning of a film career, and married to film director Roman Polanski. Eight months pregnant with their first child, Tate and four others were murdered at the Polanskis' rented Beverly Hills home in a case that was sensationalized throughout the world. The killers were eventually identified as Charles 'Tex' Watson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel, acting on behalf of the leader of their group, Charles Manson. All four were found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death, along with Leslie Van Houten, who had not participated in the murder of the Tate victims, but had participated in the murder of a Los Angeles couple the following night. The death sentences were overturned before they could be applied when the State of California temporarily abolished the death penalty.\n\nFor more than a decade after the murders, Tate battled depression and was withdrawn and unable to discuss her daughter's death. In 1982 she was told that Leslie Van Houten had obtained 900 signatures supporting her quest to achieve parole. Tate mounted a public campaign against Van Houten, winning the support of the \"National Enquirer\", which printed coupons in its magazine for people to sign and send to Doris Tate. With more than 350,000 signatures, Tate demonstrated that a considerable number of people opposed Van Houten's parole, which was denied.\n\nTate then appeared on various television talk shows, discussing her opinion of the corrections system and the impact her daughter's murder had had on her family. She joined the Los Angeles chapter of the \"Parents of Murdered Children\" organization, and while she drew support from the group, also found that she was rewarded by assuming the role of counsellor. She later became an active member of the Victim Offender Reconciliation and Justice for Homicide Victims groups. She founded COVER, the Coalition on Victim's Equal Rights, and served on the California State Advisory Committee on Correctional Services as a victims' representative.\n\nShe was part of a group that worked toward the passage of Proposition 8, the Victim's Rights Bill, which was passed in 1982. It allowed the presentation of victim impact statements during the sentencing of violent attackers. Tate became the first Californian to make such a statement after the law was passed, when she spoke at the parole hearing of one of her daughter's killers.\n\nIn 1984 she ran for the California State Assembly as an advocate for victim's rights. Though unsuccessful, she continued to campaign for changes to existing laws, and was involved in the passage of Proposition 89, which allowed the governor of the state to overturn decisions made by the Board of Prison Terms.\n\nTate's assessment of Manson, Watson, Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten was that their crimes were so vicious as to warrant execution. Addressing Charles Watson at his 1984 parole hearing, she said, \"What mercy, Sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me? ... When will Sharon come up for parole?... Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted.\" She confronted Watson again at his 1990 parole hearing.\n\nDoris Tate's health began to deteriorate after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. In 1992, she was one of several volunteer workers recognized by President George H. W. Bush as one of a \"Thousand Points of Light.\" The ceremony, during which Tate and her family were honored by the President for their work in promoting victims' rights, marked Tate's final public appearance. She died later that year at the age of 68.\n\nHer work was taken over by her younger daughters, Debra and Patricia. The Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a non-profit organization with the aim of monitoring criminal legislation and raising public awareness began in Sacramento, California in July 1993. In 1995, the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was established with the aim of providing assistance to victims and their families. Patti began to represent the Tate family at parole hearings. In 2000 Patricia died. In 1997 Debra Tate attended the parole hearing of Patricia Krenwinkel and since then has attended the parole hearings of every member of the Manson family currently imprisoned for the Tate-Labianca murders. She actively campaigns against the release of any of the Manson family convicted of murder.\n\n\n"}

It is an ionic salt of potassium ions K and nitrite ions NO, which forms a white or slightly yellow, hygroscopic crystalline powder that is soluble in water.\n\nIt is a strong oxidizer and may accelerate the combustion of other materials. Like other nitrite salts such as sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite is toxic if swallowed, and laboratory tests suggest that it may be mutagenic or teratogenic. Gloves and safety glasses are usually used when handling potassium nitrite.\n\nNitrite is present at trace levels in soil, natural waters, plant and animal tissues, and fertilizer. The pure form of nitrite was first made by the prolific Swedish chemist Scheele working in the laboratory of his pharmacy in the market town of Köping. He heated potassium nitrate at red heat for half an hour and obtained what he recognized as a new “salt.” The two compounds (potassium nitrate and nitrite) were characterized by Péligot and the reaction was established as 2KNO → 2KNO + O.\n\nPotassium nitrite can be obtained by the reduction of potassium nitrate. The production of potassium nitrite by absorption of nitrogen oxides in potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate is not employed on a large scaled because of the high price of these alkalies. Furthermore, the fact that potassium nitrite is highly soluble in water makes the solid difficult to recover.\n\nThe mixing of cyanamide and KNO produces changes from white solids to yellow liquid and then to orange solid, forming cyanogen and ammonia gases. No external energy is used and the reactions are carried out with a small amount of O.\n\nPotassium nitrite forms potassium nitrate when heated in the presence of oxygen from 550 °C to 790 °C. The rate of reaction increases with temperature, but the extent of reaction decreases. At 550 °C and 600 °C the reaction is continuous and eventually goes to completion. From 650 °C to 750 °C, as the case of decomposition of potassium nitrate is, the system attains equilibrium. At 790 °C, a rapid decrease in volume is first observed, followed by a period of 15 minutes during which no volume changes occur. This is then followed by an increase in volume due primarily to the evolution of nitrogen, which is attributed to the decomposition of potassium nitrite.\n\nPotassium nitrite reacts at an extremely slow rate with a liquid ammonia solution of potassium amide at room temperatures, and in the presence of ferric oxide or cobaltic oxide, to form nitrogen and potassium hydroxide.\n\nInterest in a medical role for inorganic nitrite was first aroused because of the spectacular success of organic nitrites and related compounds in the treatment of angina pectoris. While working with Butter at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in the 1860s, Brunton noted that the pain of angina could be lessened by venesection and wrongly concluded that the pain must be due to elevated blood pressure. As a treatment for angina, the reduction of circulating blood by venesection was inconvenient. Therefore, he decided to try the effect on a patient of inhaling amyl nitrite, a recently synthesized compound and one that his colleague had shown lowered blood pressure in animals. Pain associated with an anginal attack disappeared rapidly, and the effect lasted for several minutes, generally long enough for the patient to recover by resting. For a time, amyl nitrite was the favored treatment for angina, but due to its volatility, it was replaced by chemically related compounds that had the same effect.\n\nThe effect of potassium nitrite on the nervous system, brain, spinal cord, pulse, arterial blood pressure, and respiration of healthy human volunteers was noted, as was the variability between individuals. The most significant observation was that even a small dose of <0.5 grains (≈30 mg) given by mouth caused, at first, an increase in arterial blood pressure, followed by a moderate decrease. With larger doses, pronounced hypotension ensued. They also noted that potassium nitrite, however administered, had a profound effect on the appearance and oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. They compared the biological action of potassium nitrite with that of amyl and ethyl nitrites and concluded that the similarity of action depends on the conversion of organic nitrites to nitrous acid.\nSolutions of acidified nitrite have been used successfully to generate NO and to induce vasorelaxation in isolated blood vessel studies, and the same reaction mechanism has been proposed to explain the biological action of nitrite.\n\nPotassium nitrite is used in the manufacturing of heat transfer salts. As food additive E249, potassium nitrite is a preservative similar to sodium nitrite and is approved for usage in the EU, USA, Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 249).\n\nWhen reacting with acids, potassium nitrite forms toxic nitrous oxides. Fusion with ammonium salts results in effervescence and ignition. Reactions with reducing agents can result in fires and explosions.\n\nPotassium nitrite is stored with other oxidizing agents but separated from flammables, combustibles, reducing agents, acids, cyanides, ammonium compounds, amides, and other nitrogenous salts in a cool, dry, well ventilated location.\n\n\n"}

Born in Los Angeles, California, the Nova was the U.S. and World Amateur Boxing Champion in 1935. After turning pro, he remained undefeated in his first 22 matches, and won 40 fights in total. He was the first top rated boxer to practice yoga, and reportedly did headstands in the dressing room before his title bout with Joe Louis.\n\nIn 1938, Nova gained an upset win over Britain's Tommy Farr in a 15-round decision. Nova had Farr near a knockout in the 14th round when Referee Eddie Josephs started counting as he lay in the ropes. However, Farr resumed the fight after the count reached two. Both men were in a state of exhaustion in the last round. This fight put Nova on the American boxing map as a potential heavyweight title contender.\n\nHe went on to defeat Max Baer in the first televised heavyweight prizefight June 1, 1939, on WNBT-TV in New York. The left side of Baer's face was battered out of shape after ten rounds of the most excruciating fighting he had ever undergone, and was bleeding so severely from a severe laceration of the lower lip he could hardly breathe when the referee stopped the bout. Nova beat Baer again in 1941, although Nova was knocked down for a brief one count in the 4th from a Baer right hand. Baer was subsequently knocked down by a right for a nine count. After he got up he was knocked down again by a right hand. Referee Donovan stopped the bout when the count was at two.\n\nNova was injured badly in a fight with Tony Galento and was treated in hospital, almost losing an eye.\n\nOn September 29, 1941 he fought Joe Louis for the heavyweight title. Nova was knocked down once in the 6th round. Nova made a poor showing. According to Nat Fleischer (The Ring, December 1941, page 4) he didn't win a round and took a terrible beating in the sixth round. The end was somewhat controversial because the fight was stopped with just one second left in the round when Nova arose unsteadily from the knockdown.\n\nNova went on to box four more years, losing bouts to Lee Savold, Tami Mauriello, Lee Oma, and Joe Baksi.\n\nAfter leaving the fight ring, he became an actor. His motion picture debut was as Kid Mandell in MGM's \"Swing Fever\" (1943) starring Kay Kyser and Marilyn Maxwell. Other movie roles include that as Hubert in the 20th Century Fox film noir crime drama \"Somewhere in the Night\" (1946) starring John Hodiak, and a cameo in \"Joe Palooka, Champ\" the same year.\n\nNova acted in over 20 movies, including \"What a Way to Go!\" (1964) and \"Blackbeard's Ghost\" (1968). He appeared in one stage role, that as O'Malley in the Broadway play \"The Happiest Millionaire\" (1956) starring Walter Pidgeon, which ran for 271 performances, in which Nova performed the popular baseball poem \"Casey at the Bat\". Nova's guest spots on TV include \"Space Patrol\", \"Hopalong Cassidy\", \"General Electric Theater\", \"77 Sunset Strip\", \"Shotgun Slade\" and \"Get Smart\".\n\nNova was a practitioner of yoga and was trained by Pierre Bernard. In 1939, Nova trained for his fight with Max Baer at Bernard's estate in Nyack, New York. Nova claimed to have developed a \"cosmic punch\", based from his yoga training. The cosmic punch was mocked by Joe Louis who commented that he only received an \"Earth Punch\" from Nova.\n\nBiographer Richard Bak has noted that \"Nova was a student of Far Eastern metaphysics, including yoga, the Hindu theistic philosophy that teaches the suppression of all activity of mind, body, and will in order to liberate the spiritual self.\" Nova was a vegetarian.\n\nHe was inducted into World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991, and into the Sacramento City College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nLou Nova died from cancer at age 78 in Sacramento, California.\n\n"}

A protege of Ustad Alladiya Khan (1855–1946), the founder of the gharana, from age sixteen, she went on to become one of the most noted khayal singers of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nShe was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1953, followed by Padma Bhushan is the third highest civilian award in India, in 1969.\n\nBorn in the tiny village of Keri (also spelled \"Querim\"), in a family from Ponda \"taluka\" of North Goa, Goa (then a Portuguese colony), at the age of eight Kerkar moved to Kolhapur, where she studied for eight months with Abdul Karim Khan. Upon her return to Goa, she studied with the vocalist Ramkrishnabuwa Vaze (1871–1945), during his visits to Lamgaon.\n\nMeanwhile, Mumbai (then Bombay) under British Raj, was fast developing as a business and trade centre of the country. Several musicians and singers from North India and Central India, facing declining patronage from princely states started migrating to the city. At the age of 16, she too moved to Mumbai with her mother and uncle. A wealthy local businessman Seth Vitthaldas Dwarkadas helped her study under with Barkat Ullah Khan, sitar player and court musician at Patiala State. He taught her intermittently for two years, during his visit to the city. However, when Khan, became court musician at Mysore State, she trained under Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale (1869-1922) and Ramkrishnabuwa Vaze for short periods.\n\nEventually ending up as disciple to Ustad Alladiya Khan (1855–1946), the founder of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, beginning in 1921, and trained rigorously under him for following eleven years. Though she started singing professionally in 1930, she continued learning from Khan, despite his failing health, till his death in 1946.\n\nKerkar eventually achieved wide renown, performing regularly for aristocratic audiences. She was very particular about the representation of her work and consequently made only a few 78 rpm recordings, for the HMV and Broadcast labels. In time, Kerkar became an accomplished \"Khayal\" singer of her generation, and seldom sang light classical music, often associated with female vocalists. Her success as a public singer, along with that of Mogubai Kurdikar (mother of Kishori Amonkar), Hirabai Barodekar and Gangubai Hangal paved way for next generation of female vocalists, away from singing \"mehfil\"s or private gathering that women of previous generation had to settle for.\n\nKerkar was awarded the 1953 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, given by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy of Music, Dance & Drama, as the highest Indian recognition given to practicing artists This was followed by the decoration of Padma Bhushan by the government of India in 1969, and in the same year the government of the Indian state of Maharashtra conferred upon her the title of \"Rajya Gayika.\" Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) is said to have been very fond of Kerkar's singing. Her honorific title \"Surashri\" (or \"Surshri\") literally means \"excellent voice\" (\"sur\" meaning \"voice\" and \"shri\" meaning \"excellent), and was bestowed on her in 1948 by the Sangeet Pravin Sangitanuragi Sajjan Saman Samiti of Calcutta. She retired from public singing in 1963-64.\n\nIn her ancestral village of Keri, the Surashree Kesarbai Kerkar High School now occupies the site of Kerkar's former second home, and the house where she was born still stands, less than one kilometer away. A music festival called the Surashree Kesarbai Kerkar Smriti Sangeet Samaroha is held in Goa each November, by Kala Academy, Goa. and a music scholarship in her name is awarded annually to a University of Mumbai student by National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) via Kesarbai Kerkar Scholarship Fund. Unlike, her Guru, Kerkar was not fond of teaching, and thus taught only one disciple, Dhondutai Kulkarni, who has previously learned from Ut. Bhurji Khan, the son of Alladiya Khan and Ut. Azizuddin Khan, grand son of Alladiya Khan.\n\nKerkar has the further distinction of having one of her recordings, \"Jaat Kahan Ho\", duration 3:30 (an interpretation of raga Bhairavi) included on the Voyager Golden Record, a gold-plated copper disc containing music selections from around the world, which was sent into space aboard the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977. The recording was recommended for inclusion on the Voyager disc by the ethnomusicologist Robert E. Brown, who believed it to be the finest recorded example of Indian classical music.\n\nSince 2000, several CDs of her archival recordings have been released, including one on the \"Golden Milestones\" series, which contains several of her most famous songs.\n\n\n"}

Witzel is the Wales Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard University and the editor of the Harvard Oriental Series (volumes 50-80). He is an author on Indian sacred texts and Indian history,\n\nA critic of the Out of India theory and Hindutva-based historical revisionism, he opposed attempts to influence USA school curricula in the California textbook controversy over Hindu history.\n\nMichael Witzel was born July 18, 1943 at Schwiebus, then lived in Germany, now Poland. He studied Indology in Germany (from 1965 to 1971) under Paul Thieme, H.-P. Schmidt, K. Hoffmann and J. Narten, as well as in Nepal (1972–1973) under the Mīmāmsaka Jununath Pandit. At Kathmandu (1972–1978), he led the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project and the Nepal Research Centre. \n\nHe has taught at Tübingen (1972), Leiden (1978–1986), and at Harvard (since 1986), and has held visiting appointments at Kyoto (twice), Paris (twice), and Tokyo (twice). He has been teaching Sanskrit since 1972. \n\nWitzel is editor-in-chief of the Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies (EJVS) and the Harvard Oriental Series. Witzel has been president of the Association for the Study of Language in Prehistory (ASLIP) since 1999, as well as of the new International Association for Comparative Mythology (2006-).\n\nHe was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003, and was elected as an honorary member of the German Oriental Society (DMG) in 2009. He became Cabot Fellow, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard U. (2013), recognizing his book on comparative mythology (OUP, 2012)\n\nMain topics of scholarly research are the dialects of Vedic Sanskrit, old Indian history, the development of Vedic religion, and the linguistic prehistory of the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nWitzel's early philological work deals with the oldest texts of India, the Vedas, their manuscripts and their traditional recitation; it included some editions and translations of unknown texts (1972). such as the Katha Aranyaka. He has begun, together with T. Goto et al. a new translation of the Rigveda into German (Books I-II, 2007, Books III-V 2012)\n\nAfter 1987, he has increasingly focused on the localization of Vedic texts (1987) and the evidence contained in them for early Indian history, notably that of the Rgveda and the following period, represented by the Black Yajurveda Samhitas and the Brahmanas. This work has been done in close collaboration with Harvard archaeologists such as R. Meadow, with whom he has also co-taught. Witzel aims at indicating the emergence of the Kuru tribe in the Delhi area (1989, 1995, 1997, 2003), its seminal culture and its political dominance, as well as studying the origin of late Vedic polities and the first Indian empire in eastern North India (1995, 1997, 2003, 2010).\n\nHe studied at length the various Vedic recensions (\"śākhā\") and their importance for the geographical spread of Vedic culture across North India and beyond. This resulted in book-length investigations of Vedic dialects (1989), the development of the Vedic canon (1997), and of Old India as such (2003, reprint 2010).\n\nThe linguistic aspect of earliest Indian history has been explored in a number of papers (1993, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2009) dealing with the pre-Vedic substrate languages of Northern India. These result in a substantial amount of loan words from a prefixing language (\"Para-Munda\") similar to but not identical with Austroasiatic (Munda, Khasi, etc.) as well as from other unidentified languages. In addition, a considerable number of Vedic and Old Iranian words are traced back to a Central Asian substrate language (1999, 2003, 2004, 2006). This research is constantly updated, in collaboration with F. Southworth and D. Stampe, by the SARVA project including its South Asian substrate dictionary.\n\nIn recent years, he has explored the links between old Indian, Eurasian and other mythologies (1990, 2001-2010) resulting in a new scheme of historical comparative mythology that covers most of Eurasia and the Americas (\"Laurasia\", cf. the related Harvard, Kyoto, Beijing, Edinburgh, Ravenstein (Netherlands), Tokyo, Strasbourg, St.Petersburg, Tübingen, Yerevan conferences of IACM). This approach has been pursued in a number of papers. A book published in late 2012, \"The Origins of the World's Mythologies\", deals with the newly proposed method of historical comparative mythology at length; for scholarly criticism see and for periodic updates see It has been called a \"magnum opus\", which should be taken seriously by social anthropologists, and was praised by professor of Sanskrit Frederick Smith, who wrote that \n\nIt also received criticism. Tok Thompson called it \"racist\" and dismissed it as \"useless—and frustrating—for any serious scholar,\" while Bruce Lincoln concluded that Witzel in this publication theorizes \"in terms of deep prehistory, waves of migration, patterns of diffusion, and contrasts between the styles of thought/narration he associates with two huge aggregates of the world's population [which] strikes me as ill-founded, ill-conceived, unconvincing, and deeply disturbing in its implications.\"\n\nWitzel published articles criticizing what he calls \"spurious interpretations\" of Vedic texts and decipherments of Indus inscriptions such as that of N.S. Rajaram.\n\nWitzel has questioned the linguistic nature of the so-called Indus script (Farmer, Sproat, Witzel 2004). Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel presented a number of arguments in support of their thesis that the Indus script is non-linguistic, principal among them being the extreme brevity of the inscriptions, the existence of too many rare signs increasing over the 700-year period of the Mature Harappan civilization, and the lack of random-looking sign repetition typical for representations of actual spoken language (whether syllable-based or letter-based), as seen, for example, in Egyptian cartouches.\n\nEarlier, he had suggested that a substrate related to, but not identical with, the Austro-Asiatic Munda languages, which he therefore calls para-Munda, might have been the language of (part of) the Indus population.\n\nAsko Parpola, reviewing the Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel thesis in 2005, states that their arguments \"can be easily controverted\". He cites the presence of a large number of rare signs in Chinese, and emphasizes that there is \"little reason for sign repetition in short seal texts written in an early logo-syllabic script\". Revisiting the question in a 2007 lecture, Parpola takes on each of the 10 main arguments of Farmer et al., presenting counterarguments. He states that \"even short noun phrases and incomplete sentences qualify as full writing if the script uses the rebus principle to phonetize some of its signs\". All these points are rejected in a lengthy paper by Richard Sproat, \"Corpora and Statistical Analysis of Non-Linguistic Symbol Systems\" (2012).\n\nShorter papers provide analyses of important religious (2004) and literary concepts of the period, and its Central Asian antecedents as well as such as the oldest frame story (1986, 1987), prosimetric texts (1997), the Mahabharata (2005), the concept of rebirth (1984), the 'line of progeny' (2000), splitting one's head in discussion (1987), the holy cow (1991), the Milky Way (1984), the asterism of the Seven Rsis (1995, 1999), the sage Yajnavalkya (2003), supposed female Rishis in the Veda (2009,) the persistence of some Vedic beliefs, in modern Hinduism (1989 2002, with cultural historian Steve Farmer and John B. Henderson), as well as some modern Indocentric tendencies (2001-).\n\nOther work (1976-) deals with the traditions of medieval and modern India and Nepal,\n\nWitzel has organized a number of international conferences at Harvard such as the first of the intermittent International Vedic Workshops (1989,1999,2004; 2011 at Bucharest, 2014 at Kozhikode, Kerala), the first of several annual International Conferences on Dowry and Bride-Burning in India (1995 sqq.), the yearly Round Tables on the Ethnogenesis of South and Central Asia (1999 sqq) and, since 2005, conferences on comparative mythology (Kyoto, Beijing, Edinburgh, Ravenstein (Netherlands), Tokyo, Harvard, Tokyo).\n\nAt the Beijing conference he founded the International Association for Comparative Mythology.\n\nIn 2005, Witzel joined other academics and activist groups to oppose changes to California state school history textbooks proposed by US-based Hindu groups, mainly \"The Vedic Foundation\" and \"Hindu Education Foundation\" (HEF), arguing that the changes were not of a scholarly but of a religious-political nature. He was appointed to an expert panel set up to review the changes and helped draft the compromise edits that were later adopted.\n\nWitzel's efforts received the support of academics and some community groups,\nbut attracted severe criticism from those supporting the original changes, who questioned his expertise on the subject and his appointment to the expert panel.\n\nWitzel was issued a subpoena by the California Parents for Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM), a group founded specifically for the schoolbook case, in November 2006 to support their law case against the California authorities' decisions in the textbook case. He was sued by CAPEEM to compel with the subpoena in Massachusetts courts, which was however dismissed twice. He had already submitted documents to CAPEEM and undergone a deposition.\n\nWitzel was also accused of being biased against Hinduism, an allegation he denies.\n\nRejecting criticism that he was a \"Hindu hater\", Witzel said, \"I hate people who misrepresent history.\"\n\nThe HEF campaign was dismissed by critics as \"one driven by the sectarian agenda of the Sangh Parivar, a term commonly used to describe the Hindu nationalist triumvirate of India's Bharatiya Janata Party, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.\" In a letter to the Board of Education, Vinay Lal, a history professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, wrote:\n\n\n\n"}

The project is based on fusing the music of a traditional brass band with acid house and Detroit techno.\n\nAcid Brass began in 1997 as a collaboration between Deller, the Stockport-based Fairey Brass Band and Rodney Newton who created all the brass arrangements. Deller saw a connection between the two apparently disparate genres, viewing them as \"two authentic forms of folk art rooted in specific communities\". The music has since been taken all over the world, and was performed by the Fairey Band before a London crowd of 25,000 in July 2005.\n\nIn 1997, The KLF co-founder Bill Drummond heard Acid Brass performing The KLF's \"What Time Is Love?\" as part of their encore. Consequently, Acid Brass collaborated with The KLF (appearing in their alternative personae as The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu) on a track titled \"Fuck the Millennium\", incorporating Acid Brass' cover of \"What Time Is Love?\". The track was released as a single under the moniker 2K.\n\nThe track \"The Groove that won't stop\" was played over the end titles to the 2010 movie \"Four Lions\".\n\nThe Fairey Band still plays regular Acid Brass gigs at major music festivals in the UK and abroad, and in 2011 issued a new Acid Brass CD.\n\nThe original \"Acid Brass\" album was released on 3 November on the Blast First label and featured versions of dance classics such as A Guy Called Gerald's \"Voodoo Ray\", Rhythm Is Rhythm's \"Strings of Life\" and 808 State's \"Pacific 202\". The original studio album was recorded at the BBC North's sound studios on Oxford Road in Manchester, whilst a live version was recorded on 1 March 1997 at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts.\n\nA new collection entitled \"Acid Brass 2 - In Yer Face!\" was recorded in January 2011. It consists of 10 arrangements by Richard Rock of acid house hits such as \"Infinity\", \"Jack to the Sound of the Underground\", \"Acid Thunder\", \"Theme from S-Express\" and \"We Call It Acieed\".\n\n\"Acid Brass\" was released to generally favourable reviews. Steve Huey of Allmusic was mixed in his assessment, who said \"the somewhat dodgy (and condescending) concept for this record, by artist Jeremy Deller, is that both brass bands and raves are staples of British working-class life, so a fusion of the two styles of music is natural. While the results are certainly well played, it's extremely difficult to figure out exactly who Acid Brass is supposed to appeal to, except maybe the kitsch audience.\" Joshua Klein of \"The A.V. Club\" was favourable, saying: \"If the musicians weren't so serious about the endeavor, it wouldn't quite work, and as it stands, A Guy Called Gerald's 'Voodoo Ray' sounds pretty silly when played by a marching band. But the arrangements retain much of the simple hookiness of the originals.\"\n\n"}

It was opened by the South Devon Railway Company in 1847. Situated on the Exeter to Plymouth Line, it is down the line from and measured from via .\n\nIt is served by Great Western Railway and CrossCountry train services.\n\nTotnes railway station was built by the South Devon Railway Company and opened on 20 July 1847 when trains started to run on the line from Newton, as Newton Abbot was known at the time. It was a terminus until 5 May 1848 when trains started to run through to Plymouth, initially using a temporary terminus at Laira. The line was intended to be operated by atmospheric power and an engine house to provide power was built behind the eastbound platform, although it was never brought into use. The two platform tracks were covered by wooden train sheds, an engine shed was built south of the line beyond the westbound platform, and a goods shed was erected between this platform and the River Dart which the line crossed on a viaduct just to the east of the platforms.\n\nTotnes became the junction for the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway's line to Ashburton when it opened on 1 May 1872. The South Devon Railway was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876 and the Buckfastleigh company was absorbed in 1897. Trains were suspended on 21 and 22 May 1892 while the original broad gauge tracks were replaced by those of standard gauge. The engine shed was closed in 1904 although the turntable was retained for five more years.\n\nThere was a freight only branch line which ran down to the quay at Totnes wharf (plains), the bridge which carried this line can still be partially seen adjacent to the footpath which leads from the BR station towards the riverside walk. The line crossed over the main road at the bottom of Bridgetown bridge via a level crossing to access The Plains. Some of the track formation can still be seen on The Plains.\n\nThe westbound platform was damaged during an air raid in World War II on 21 October 1942. The Ashburton branch train was damaged in the attack, two people killed and two more injured.\n\nOn 1 January 1948 the Great Western Railway was nationalised to become the Western Region of British Railways. Passenger services to Ashburton were withdrawn on 3 November 1958 and the line closed entirely on 10 September 1962. A few months earlier, on 14 April 1962, a fire destroyed the main buildings situated on the westbound platform at Totnes. General goods traffic was withdrawn on 14 June 1965 although coal continued to be handled until 4 December 1967 and milk until 1980, from the dairy that incorporates the building intended for the atmospheric engines.\n\nA new station building was opened on 21 October 1983 to replace the temporary buildings that had served the station since the fire in 1962. From 5 April 1985 to 2 September 1987 trains on the Buckfastleigh line, now the South Devon Railway heritage line, operated into the station. A footbridge across the River Dart was opened on 30 September 1993 which now allows people to walk to Totnes (Riverside) railway station to join the heritage trains to Buckfastleigh.\n\nThe 1887-built footbridge that spanned the station and gave access to the operating floor of the signal box was destroyed on 18 October 1987 when hit by a crane engaged in track renewals. It was replaced by a new bridge which was in turn replaced by a newer footbridge and lifts in 2019.\n\nThe signals were initially controlled by \"policemen\" who walked to each signal to change it, but from 1894 they were controlled from a wooden signal box at the west end of the westbound platform. This was replaced in 1923 by a brick-built signal box towards the opposite end of the eastbound platform. From 17 December 1973 this was a \"fringe box\" to the Panel Signal Box at Plymouth railway station, when the signal boxes at Brent and other intermediate locations were closed. Totnes itself was closed on 9 November 1987 when new multiple-aspect signals were brought into use, controlled from the new signalling centre at Exeter. The signal box, a Grade II listed building, is now used as a café.\n\nOn 13 March 1860 the boiler of the locomotive \"Tornado\" exploded while standing at Totnes, killing the driver.\n\nThe railway approaches from Newton Abbot in the north-east runs south-westerly through the station and then swings to the west on a right-hand curve, which is the start of the steep climb up to Rattery. There are four tracks through the station with platforms alongside the outer pair.\n\nThe modern brick-built station building is on the south-east side of the station, nearest the town. This is the platform for trains to Plymouth and Penzance. Trains to Newton Abbot, Exeter and beyond depart from the opposite platform, which can be reached by a footbridge on the south-west side of the entrance to the platform. The old signal box on the platform used by trains to Newton Abbot serves as the station café.\n\nThere is level access to the station from the car park on the south-east side and also from the area in front of the milk factory on the north-west side which can be reached by the road bridge that spans the tracks just to the south-west of the station.\n\nBuses to Dartmouth operate from the car park on the south-east side. A footpath from here leads under the viaduct at the north-east end of the station to a footbridge that crosses the River Dart alongside the railway to reach Totnes Riverside station, from where trains run to Buckfastleigh railway station.\n\nThe industrial complex on the north-west side of the station houses the milk factory; the grey stone building behind the signal box is the atmospheric engine house. The opposite side of the station is dominated by Totnes Castle, on the hill.\n\nAbout half of the services are operated by Great Western Railway, including main line services from London Paddington to Plymouth and Penzance. The rest are run by CrossCountry, who operate trains through and Birmingham New Street to Manchester Piccadilly, the north east of England ( and Newcastle) and Scotland ( & /).\n\n"}
{"id": "2106092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106092", "title": "Crocodile (locomotive)", "text": "Crocodile (locomotive)\n\nCrocodile (German Krokodil) electric locomotives are so called because they have long \"noses\" at each end, reminiscent of the snout of a crocodile (see also Steeplecab). These contain the motors and drive axles, and are connected by an articulated center section. The center section usually contains the crew compartments, pantographs and transformer. \n\nThe name was first applied to Swiss locomotives. Sometimes the term is applied to locomotives in other countries of a similar design.\n\nA prototype locomotive, SBB-CFF-FFS Ce 6/8 I number 14201, was ordered in June 1917. The production \"Crocodiles\" were the series \"SBB Ce 6/8 II\" and \"SBB Ce 6/8 III\" locomotives of the SBB, Swiss Federal Railways, built between 1919 and 1927. There were 33 class Ce 6/8 II and 18 class Ce 6/8 III, making a total (excluding the prototype) of 51 locomotives. These locomotives were developed for pulling heavy goods trains on the steep tracks of the Gotthardbahn from Lucerne to Chiasso, including the Gotthard Tunnel. \n\nThe electric motors available at the time were large and had to be body-mounted above the plane of the axles, but flexibility was required to negotiate the tight curves on the Alpine routes and tunnels. An articulated design, with two powered nose units bridged with a pivoting center section containing cabs and the heavy transformer, met both requirements and gave excellent visibility from driving cabs mounted safely away from any collision. The two motors in each nose unit were geared to a jackshaft between the drive axles farthest from the cab (SBB Ce 6/8 II) or farthest from the end (SBB Ce 6/8 III), with side rods carrying the power to the drivers. These locomotives, sometimes called the \"Swiss Crocodile\" or \"SBB Crocodile\", were highly successful and served until the 1982. The German model railway manufacturer Märklin published a book about their history in 1984. Nine out of 51 total produced have survived, but only three are still in operation as preserved historical locomotives in Switzerland.\n\nBetween 1942 and 1947, thirteen members of class Ce 6/8 II were upgraded with more powerful motors, to allow a higher top speed, and these became class Be 6/8 II. This required raising the jackshaft above the plane of the axles, necessitating a more complex system of side rods. In 1956, all eighteen members of class Ce 6/8 III were upgraded and became class Be 6/8 III.\n\nAs well as standard gauge Crocodiles, there are also narrow gauge versions. The best known are the Rhaetian Railway (RhB)'s metre gauge locomotives of class Ge 6/6 I, the Rhaetian Crocodile. Several of these still run on passenger trains on special occasions. They are also used on freight trains in busy periods. The Bernina Railway (later merged with the RhB) also built a single Crocodile type, the Ge 4/4, nicknamed the \"Bernina Crocodile\". This locomotive survives and is being restored to operating condition.\n\nTwo other Swiss narrow-gauge railways also have locomotives nicknamed Crocodiles; the BVZ Zermatt-Bahn (BVZ) (which merged with the Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO) in 2003 to form the Matterhorn-Gotthard-Bahn) uses series \"HGe 4/4 I\", known as the Zermatt crocodile, while the Chemin de Fer Yverdon-Ste. Croix owns a solitary class \"Ge 4/4\" #21. Neither of these locomotive types have an articulated body, which leads some railfans to nickname them \"false crocodiles\".\n\nVery similar locomotives were used in Austria as Austrian Federal Railways (\"Österreichische Bundesbahn\") classes ÖBB 1089 and ÖBB 1189, and are often known as \"Austrian Crocodiles\".\n\nThe German classes E 93 and E 94, also used by the ÖBB as series 1020, are sometimes called \"German crocodiles\". They are sometimes nicknamed \"Alligators\", instead, because of their broader, shorter snouts.\n\nThe French SNCF 25 kV AC locomotives of classes CC 14000 and CC 14100, used mainly for iron ore trains on the , have sometimes been called \"crocodiles\", although more commonly \"flatirons\". They are different from the Swiss crocodiles in that they are not articulated, but are a single long steeplecab or 'monocabine' with a bogie beneath each end.\n\nCrocodile locomotives were also used in India. These locomotives, of series WCG-1, were used from 1928 between Bombay and Pune, and were all built to the Indian broad gauge of 5 ft 6 in (1676 mm). The first 10 locomotives were built by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works. Vulcan Foundry of Great Britain constructed a further 31 examples for this line.\n\nThe articulated-body design was not unique to the Crocodiles. It was used in the United States on the Milwaukee Road class EP-2 \"Bi-Polars\", for example.\n\nMany more locomotives adopted the design of long noses without articulation of the body. The single GE 4/4 of the Yverdon–Ste-Croix railway was known as the \"Crocodile\", despite being an elongated Bo-Bo steeplecab with articulated bogies beneath, rather than an articulated locomotive. This extended to painting it with large crocodile heads on each side.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the LNER Class ES1 featured a crocodile-like design and was built between 1902 and 1904, both locomotives remaining in service until 1966, when No.2 was scrapped and No. 1 (BR No.26500) was preserved, now on display at Shildon Locomotion Museum.\n\nThe Panama Canal uses double-ended locomotives, known as 'mules', to act as land-based tugs to steer ships through the Canal's lock chambers.\n\nFurthermore, some examples of locomotives similar in design to the Crocodiles, which were manufactured by Škoda can be found on the route between Borjomi and Bakuriani in Georgia.\n\n\n"}

Eugenio Vitale serves as the director of games development for Deep Silver.\n\nDeep Silver was announced in November 2002, with their first release to be \"Anarchy Online: The Notum Wars\". According to Craig McNichol, who ran Koch Media's England branch, the idea behind Deep Silver was to have a business segment that would develop games that would complement the games Koch Media was distributing on behalf of other publishers. McNichol also stated that Deep Silver's name was subject to much internal discussion. Koch Media invested in Deep Silver in July 2003, and in November 2003, all of Koch Media's game publishing operations (excluding distribution) were reallocated to Deep Silver. The division had been continuously active since, primarily in Europe. In April 2008, Koch Media opened Deep Silver, Inc., a subsidiary branch based in Los Angeles, under Deep Silver's name. In August 2007, Games That Matter, a studio founded by former Rockstar Vienna employees in 2006, was acquired by Koch Media and became part of Deep Silver under the name Deep Silver Vienna. Co-founders Niki Laber and Hannes Seifert had left the studio by January 2010, at which point Deep Silver Vienna was shut down. Deep Silver Vienna has only produced one game, \"Cursed Mountain\", which was developed in association with Sproing Interactive and released in August 2009 for Wii.\n\nDeep Silver first gained widespread attention until their release of \"Dead Island\" and their acquisition of Volition. \"Dead Island\" had been their first release to reach the top spot on sales charts in September 2011, and they acquired Volition in January 2013, alongside the rights to the \"Metro\" series, from the bankruptcy proceedings of THQ. Deep Silver also acquired a minority interest in Berlin-based free-to-play game developer Infernum Productions in December 2012. In February 2013, Deep Silver announced its intentions to expand into the mobile games market.\n\nIn December 2013, Fishlabs, which had filed for self-administration the previous October, was acquired by Koch Media and became Deep Silver's dedicated mobile game studio. As the agreement was an asset deal, the legal entity of the studio was dissolved and Fishlabs was reorganised as a division, officially known as Deep Silver Fishlabs. In July 2014, Deep Silver acquired the rights to \"Homefront\" and its in-development sequel, \"\", from German developer Crytek. Dambuster Studios (officially, Deep Silver Dambuster Studios) was established to continue the development of \"The Revolution\", succeeding Crytek UK. Later on the same day, Crytek announced that Crytek UK would be closed, and all of its staff transferred to Dambuster Studios. In August 2018, Koch Media acquired the rights to the \"TimeSplitters\" games, which would be overseen by Deep Silver.\n\nIn May 2020, Koch Media and THQ Nordic, by this time both part of Embracer Group, exchanged several intellectual property rights: Deep Silver received \"Red Faction\" and \"Painkiller\", while handing off \"Risen\", \"Rush for Berlin\", \"Sacred\", \"Second Sight\", and \"\".\n\nIn January 2013, Deep Silver announced a special edition of their then-upcoming game \"\", titled \"Zombie Bait Edition\", which would include a in Europe and Australia. After strong criticism over the item, Deep Silver initially offered an apology, stating that they were \"deeply sorry\" and promising consumers that something like that would not happen again. However, when the game was released in April that year, the bust was still included, generating further backlash.\n\nIn January 2019, Deep Silver partnered with Epic Games on a one-year exclusivity deal for the personal computer (PC) version of their upcoming game \"Metro Exodus\" on Epic's digital distribution storefront, the Epic Games Store. Through this deal, \"Metro Exodus\" was removed from Steam, another digital distribution storefront, where Deep Silver had been selling pre-orders for the game since August 2018. Additionally, the deal was made and announced less than three weeks prior to game's release, causing criticism and confusion among critics and fans of the \"Metro\" franchise. Valve, the company behind Steam, labelled the move as unfair to consumers, while fans review-bombed previous entries of the series on Steam.\n\nFranchises published by Deep Silver include \"Metro\" from 4A Games and Volition's \"Saints Row\", both of which were acquired through THQ's bankruptcy auction in 2013, as well as Techland-created \"Dead Island\".

Known as the Windwalkers, HMT-301 was part of Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24) and 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nHMT-301 was deactivated by general order in 2005.\n\nHMT-301 traces its roots back to April 1, 1966. First activated at MCAS(H) Santa Ana, California as HMMT-301, the squadron has a long track record of producing fleet ready aviators in aircraft ranging from the UH-34 to the current CH-53D. Aircrew trained at HMT-301 have utilized the core skills learned to serve the United States in conflicts from Vietnam to the present-day global war against terrorism.\n\nOriginally flying the UH-34 Sea Horse, HMMT-301 was assigned the mission of providing fleet helicopter training to newly designated naval aviators, transition training for fixed wing pilots, and on the job training for enlisted flight crewmembers. By mid-1967, in response to the need for trained helicopter crews for combat duty in Southeast Asia, the number grew to ninety officers and over two hundred enlisted.\n\nJanuary 25, 1968 marked the arrival of the Sikorsky CH-53A Sea Stallion helicopter, a heavy-lift capable helicopter, and the redesignation of HMMT-301 as HMHT-301, the Marine Heavy Training Squadron 301. The UH-34 type helicopter retired shortly afterward, once again making the squadron a one-aircraft unit.\n\nRestructuring of Marine Aviation led to the emergence of Marine Helicopter Training Squadron 301 (HMT-301) on March 31, 1972. The newly designated squadron flew both the CH-46 and CH-53A aircraft.\n\nThe squadron produced fleet ready aviators in these aircraft for the next ten years. In 1982 the CH-46 D/F models were replaced by the upgraded CH-46E. On December 13, 1983, HMT-301 took delivery of the first of the new Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters. With the activation of the new table of organization, which reflected the addition of the CH-53E and the Fleet Readiness Aviation Maintenance Personnel (FRAMP) program, HMT-301 officially became the largest squadron in the Marine Corps.\n\nHMT-301's sister squadron, HMT-302, was reactivated in November 1987, and 301's CH-53A and CH-53E assets were transferred to HMT-302. HMT-301 was reduced from the largest squadron in the Marine Corps to a relatively small squadron with 10 CH-46E aircraft and 200 personnel. HMT-301 was deactivated at Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin, California. The squadron had successfully trained over 2500 Naval Aircrew, flying four different aircraft for over 130,000 hours.\n\nTwo years later, on August 24, 1995, HMT-301 returned to the rolls of Marine Corps Aviation, making a new home at its current duty station of Kaneohe Bay. Since its reactivation, the Windwalkers have continued to carry out their assigned mission of training first tour, refresher, conversion, and transition aviators for the CH-53D helicopter community. The squadron has also been tasked to provide support for tactical operations, troop movements, emergency medevacs, VIP transport and static displays.\n\nOn June 3, 2005, HMT-301 was deactivated for the second time. From its formation in 1966 to its last flight in 2005, HMT-301 has flown over 144,000 hours, trained over 2800 aircrew, and been awarded the CNO safety award 7 times.\n\n\n\n"}

The title has been in abeyance since 1554, although it is possible to argue that it has been merged.\n\nThe 1st Baron West was Sir Thomas West, of Oakhanger, Northampton. He married the heiress Joan De la Warr, through whom his second son eventually became Baron De La Warr. The two titles descended together until the death of Thomas West, 6th Baron West and 9th Baron De la Warr.\n\nAt this point, the precise legal situation becomes debatable. As Cokayne points out, abeyance is merely a modern rule that approximates medieval practice. However, in applying the modern rule, both titles descend to \"heirs general\", which left them in abeyance between the daughters of Sir Owen West, and this situation persists to the present day with their respective heirs.\n\nIn 1572 William West, the heir male and nephew of the co-heirs general, was created Baron De la Warr, but not Baron West, by letters patent. Depending on one's view of the law, this can be interpreted as either a settlement of the ancient Barony of De la Warr or a new creation that extinguished the old barony. Cokayne argues that there is no reason to assume that this changed the status of the title Baron West, but given the irregular practice used, it is just conceivable that a modern claimant to the Barony of West would be refused on the basis that the title was merged into the Barony of De la Warr, along with the estates.\n\nSome genealogical sources claim that Sir Thomas West (1251–1344) of Hempston Cantilupe, in Devon, was summoned to Parliament and became Baron West in 1342, but this is not supported by Cokayne.\n\n\n"}

He was the party's candidate for President of the United States in 1996 receiving 8,463 votes and again in 2000 when his ticket received 7,378 votes. Harris also served as an alternate candidate for Róger Calero in 2004 and 2008 in states where Calero could not qualify for the ballot (due to being born in Nicaragua). In 2004 he received 7,102 votes of the parties 10,791 votes. In 2008 he received 2,424 votes. More recently Harris was the SWP candidate in the 2009 Los Angeles mayoral election receiving 2,057 votes for 0.89% of the vote. Harris served for a time as the national organization secretary of the SWP. He was a staff writer for the socialist newsweekly \" The Militant \" in New York. He wrote about the internal resistance to South African apartheid and in 1994 traveled to South Africa to attend the Congress of South African Trade Unions convention. In July 2012, Harris was named the Socialist Workers Party nominee for president. The vice presidential nominee was Maura DeLuca.\n\nBorn into a working-class, African American family in Cleveland, Ohio, Harris first became politically active in the civil rights movement. With growing protests against racist discrimination, tens of thousands of Black families in the city staged a school strike in the early 1960s, setting up \"Freedom Schools\" to study African-American history.\n\nOn graduating from high school, Harris attended Cleveland State University, where he was a founding member of the Black Student Union. He organized fellow students into demonstrations opposing the Vietnam War as well as actions against racist practices of the college, which then had only a small percentage of Black students. He became a member of the Student Mobilization Committee Against the War in Vietnam and later served on its national staff in Washington, D.C.\n\nThrough these experiences he joined and later became a leader of the Young Socialist Alliance. He ran for school board in Cleveland on the Socialist Workers ticket in 1969, and soon after joined the Socialist Workers Party.\n\nA supporter of the Cuban revolution, Harris participated in the second Venceremos Brigade to Cuba in 1969 along with hundreds of other youth from the United States. Brigade members cut sugar cane for a couple of months in an expression of solidarity with the efforts by millions of working people in Cuba to maximize sugar production. Working alongside Cuban workers and meeting volunteers from Vietnam, Korea, and elsewhere deepened his sense of internationalism.\n\nHarris moved to Atlanta in the early 1970s, and joined in the struggles of the Black community against police brutality. At the time, a number of young Blacks had been killed by police SWAT squad units. Later Harris helped mobilize supporters of Black rights in Atlanta to join actions in Boston in the battle for busing and school desegregation in that city.\n\nIn 1977 Harris moved to New York City to join the staff of the National Student Coalition Against Racism, which had helped lead mobilizations for school desegregation. He became a national chairperson of the coalition.\n\nHarris later worked in a garment factory in Los Angeles, as the SWP deepened its industrial base by building units of party members in the garment unions. In Los Angeles he was the chairperson of the SWP in the city.\n\nHe also participated in brigades to defend the Nicaraguan revolution in the mid-1980s, and joined a delegation to visit revolutionary Grenada in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1988 Harris was the Socialist Workers Party candidate in New York for the United States Senate. Harris finished seventh with 11,239 votes.\n\nHarris lived and worked in Detroit in the early 1990s and was a member of the United Auto Workers there. He helped broaden solidarity with labor struggles such as those of workers on strike against Caterpillar. Harris spent several months in Peoria, Illinois, helping establish a branch of the Socialist Workers Party there in response to the battle by members of the UAW against Caterpillar.\n\nHarris is a strong critic of the death penalty and he has been active in a struggle against police brutality in Valdosta, Georgia, and has participated in activity with the People's Tribunal, an organization centered on death of Willie James Williams, killed while in police custody in that southern Georgia town.\n\n"}

It works similarly to the Automatic Warning System (AWS) used in the United Kingdom.\n\nCommunication between the ground-based signalling system and the in-cab equipment is made by the crocodile, an electrical contact placed between the rails (in the four foot way) and a metallic brush mounted beneath the locomotive cab. It is distinctively French, originating on the Chemins de Fer du Nord around 1872, spreading throughout France and penetrating into Belgium and Luxembourg after 1900.

Originally it was placed 100–200 metres in front of a distant signal, usually a red disc of \"deferred stop\". When recording of cab signals was introduced, the device was moved closer to the signal, most often directly opposite it, to reduce the chance of a change of the signal between the time the locomotive passed over the crocodile and when the locomotive actually passed the signal. If a signal changed suddenly to a caution or danger aspect in the face of the driver, it would appear that he had not noticed it and had been surprised, when that was not the case.\n\nThe crocodile can provide two different pieces of information to the driver, according to the aspect of the corresponding signal:\n\n"}

The brand then further expanded by being sold to the Imperial Group, and forming a partnership with Esso garages, which saw a rapid increase of new roadside locations in the 1980s. The restaurants offered similar fare to Little Chef, such as offering English breakfasts and fish and chips. A distinctive difference to customers between the two chains was that Happy Eater provided outdoor animal-themed playground equipment for children. Outlets were mostly located in the Midlands and the South East of England, with many locations situated along the A1 road corridor.\n\nIn 1986, Trusthouse Forte, who owned Little Chef at the time, went on to acquire Happy Eater from the Imperial Group. In 1995, Granada purchased Trusthouse Forte, and began to streamline their business by converting the Happy Eater locations into Little Chef locations. By the end of 1997, all Happy Eater restaurants either completed the transition, or were closed.\n\nThe defunct brand is currently owned by Hybrid Dining Limited, a subsidiary of Kout Food Group, who also own Little Chef.\n\nIn 1973 a former managing director of the hotel group Trust House Forte, Michael Pickard, founded a family-orientated roadside restaurant, aimed at competing with the established pre-eminent chain in the industry, Little Chef. By 1980 Pickard had built up a chain of 21 restaurants when he sold Happy Eater to the Imperial Group conglomerate. Imperial expanded the chain to 75 restaurants, before selling the chain in 1986 to Trust House Forte, who owned the Little Chef chain. Trusthouse Forte continued to expand the Happy Eater chain alongside Little Chef.\n\nThe Happy Eater chain employed female table serving staff. Male staff were reserved for management, cooking, dishwashing and other support roles. Until, in 1985, a male employee named Ron Weekes, working at the Broadbridge Heath, West Sussex restaurant, requested an opportunity to work front of house, waiting tables. This opportunity was granted by the duty manager, thus Weekes became the first male waiter across the national chain.\n\nThe chain received media attention in 1991 when Prime Minister John Major stopped at a Happy Eater outlet for a fried breakfast on his way to a Young Conservatives conference.\n\nTrusthouse Forte was taken over in 1995 by Granada.\n\nIn 1995, Little Chef began to takeover Happy Eater locations, and by the end of 1997, all Happy Eater restaurants were either converted into Little Chef, or closed. Following various changes in ownership, Little Chef itself began to hit financial difficulties in the mid-2000s, before eventually dissolving in January 2018.\n\nSince 1996, a Mauritian restaurant chain has traded as \"Happy Eater.\" In addition to the same name, it also has a logo similar to that of its British-founded counterpoint.\n\n"}

Sherry was sworn in as the Assistant Treasurer on 9 June 2009, after serving as the first Australian Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law. Sherry was the first Assistant Treasurer from Tasmania.\n\nSherry was born in Kingston upon Thames, London. He was educated at the University of Tasmania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Administration. Sherry was also active in the student union while at university, sitting on the Tasmanian University Union and various business committees from 1976–1979.\n\nSherry started his working life as a night cashier and auditor at the Wrest Point Hotel and Casino in Hobart. While working at Wrest Point, Sherry joined the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees' Union and became State Secretary of the then FLAIEU between 1979 and 1990. In 1992, the FLAIEU amalgamated with another union to form the present day Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (LHMU).\n\nWhile State Secretary, Sherry also helped establish the HostPlus Superannuation Fund, an industry superannuation fund then only for hospitality industry workers, but now a full public offer fund with over $7 billion under management. Sherry held the position of trustee of HostPlus from 1987–1990 and was also a trustee, manager, and company secretary of ClubPlus Superannuation fund. Sherry held positions on the State Executive of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council from 1988–1990 and was President from 1988–1990.\n\nDuring his time as State Secretary, Sherry held a number of positions including Board Member at the College of Hospitality, Board Member of the Hospitality Group Training and Board Member of Employment and Skills Formation Council.\n\nSherry was elected to the Senate in 1990, representing Tasmania for the Australian Labor Party. Between 1993 and 1996 he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the Second Keating Ministry.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Keating government, Sherry was elected Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and held many positions in the front bench including Shadow Minister for Finance and Shadow Assistant Treasurer. He also held Shadow Ministries for financial services, banking, superannuation, business regulation, consumer affairs and intergenerational finance.\n\nIn October 1997, however, he was accused of improper use of his Parliamentary travel allowance. Although he was later cleared of these allegations, it caused significant distress and he attempted suicide. He was later diagnosed with clinical depression. His suicide attempt again gained media attention after Greg Wilton became the first Australian Federal Parliamentarian to take his own life, in June 2000. At the time Sherry was open about his own experiences with depression from which he recovered in 1999.\nSherry took time away from the Shadow Ministry, but returned to the frontbench in 2001 as Shadow Minister for Retirement Incomes and Savings, a position he held until 2004. In 2004 Sherry was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Finance and Superannuation and in 2005 he was appointed as the Shadow Minister for Superannuation and Intergenerational Finance and Shadow Minister for Banking and Financial Services, positions he held until the 2007 election.\n\nSherry has participated on a number of Senate and Joint Parliamentary Committees during his time in Parliament. These include Senate Standing committees on Scrutiny of Bills, Appropriations and Staffing, Privileges and Regulations and Ordinances.\n\nSherry has also participated on the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Committees for Employment, Education and Training, Rural and Regional Affairs, Economics Legislation Committee and the Finance and Public Administration Committees.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2003, Sherry was a key member of, and under Labor chaired, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This committee made a number of recommendations on the performance of the superannuation industry including the key Senate breakthrough that led to the introduction of the Compulsory Superannuation Guarantee system.\n\nOn 3 December 2007 Sherry was appointed Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law in the Labor Government of Kevin Rudd.\n\nAs Australia's first Minister for Superannuation, Sherry spoke often about the need to lower fees in the industry to provide better retirement incomes for Australians. This culminated in the Minister setting up the Review into the Governance, Efficiency and Structure and Operation of Australia's Superannuation System, also known as the Cooper Review, after its head Jeremy Cooper. The Cooper Review was the first systemic, in-depth review of the operation, efficiency, cost and performance of Australia's compulsory $1.1 trillion the superannuation system ever conducted. The Gillard Government released the Cooper Review on 5 July 2010.\n\nAs Minister for Corporate Law, Sherry held responsibility for the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), and oversight of the Australian stock market, during the most serious global financial crisis in 75 years. During the global financial crisis Minister Sherry implemented a range of measures aimed at stabilising aspects of the regulatory system and enhancing the oversight of key market participants. These measures included a legislative ban on naked short selling, improved regulation and disclosure of covered short selling, the introduction of oversight and compliance arrangements for credit rating agencies and the transition of the remaining financial and consumer credit services from the Australian states and territories to the Federal Government.\n\nSherry also drove key reforms in the provision of financial advice to superannuation members that now enable funds to provide general financial advice.\n\nSherry also signed several financial services mutual recognition agreements with key Australian partners, including the United States and New Zealand.\n\nSherry held the portfolio of Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law until 9 June 2009, at which point he was promoted to Assistant Treasurer.\n\nAs Assistant Treasurer Sherry assisted the Treasurer in the development, implementation and\nadministration of policies in the Treasury portfolio, including a specific focus on taxation, tax design and the national tax reform program (known as Australia's Future Tax System review, or the Henry Review), foreign investment matters, productivity reform issues, international economic regulation, international mutual recognition arrangements and global accounting standards.\n\nHe established the national Tax Practitioners Board and significantly reformed our Managed Investment Trust law and GST (Goods and Services Tax) administration arrangements.\n\nIn 2011, Nick Sherry, the Small Business Minister of the time, received widespread national criticism when he was reported in the national media to have said that internet book sales would soon leave just a few specialist bookshops in capital cities. He said that 'in five years other than a few specialist bookshops...you will not see a bookstore. They will cease to exist because of what's happening with internet-based, web-based distribution.'\n\nSherry also sat on Cabinet's Expenditure Review Committee responsible for the management of Australia's national annual Budget and also had responsibility for the Productivity Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Royal Australian Mint and the Board of Taxation.\n\nFollowing the election of Julia Gillard's government, Sherry was appointed Minister for Small Business on 14 September 2010. He was also the Minister Assisting or Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation and Minister Assisting on Tourism. At the 2011 Labor National Conference Sherry told Gillard he wanted to step down from the cabinet as part of the upcoming cabinet reshuffle.\n\nOn 12 December 2011, Sherry announced that he would be retiring from the Senate at the 2013 election. He later announced he would resign at the beginning of June 2012, creating a casual Senate vacancy. Lin Thorp won the preselection vote to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement.\n\n\n"}

It is 16 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of City of Parramatta.\n\nNewington is 2 km west of Wentworth Point, on the Parramatta River, and 1 km north-west of Sydney Olympic Park. It is best known as the location of the Athletes Village for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and 2000 Summer Paralympics. The Athlete's Village was converted to residential apartments after the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. Other apartments and free-standing houses have also been built since. A memorial featuring all the names of the Australian athletes who participated at the Sydney 2000 Olympics and 2000 Summer Paralympics stands on a reserve opposite Newington Marketplace.\n\nThe suburb of Newington took its name from the Newington Estate which was named by John Blaxland after his family estate in Kent, England.\n\nNewington is situated on the traditional aboriginal lands of the \"Wann\" clan, known as the \"Wann-gal\". The lands of the Wann-gal stretched along the southern shore of the Parramatta River between Cockle Bay (\"Cadi-gal\" land) and Parramatta (\"Burramatta-gal\" land). The other side of Parramatta River was occupied by the \"Wallumetta-gal\" people.\n\nWithin ten days of the First Fleet arriving in Australia, records had been made of \"The Flats\", the extensive tidal wetlands at Homebush Bay. Between the years 1788 to 1831, blocks of land ranging from 100 to 10,000 acres (40 km²) were given out to the first European settlers by dividing up the Wanng-al clans' land. These land grants were inked in on County of Cumberland maps, with names of owners and land granted clearly indicated on the maps.\n\nIn 1807, John Blaxland acquired 520 hectares of land, reserving the original grants of Waterhouse, Shortland, Archer and Haslam. He named the estate Newington after his family estate in Kent, England. Blaxland established a series of salt pans on the banks of the Parramatta River and by 1827, was producing 8 tons of salt each week for the Sydney market. Blaxland also established a tweed mill, limekiln and flourmill. Newington House was completed in 1832 and St Augustine's Chapel in 1838.\n\nIn 1843, Blaxland mortgaged the property to the Australian Trust Company. After he died in 1851 the Trust Company sold the property to John Dobie to recover the mortgage. The Blaxland family re-purchased the estate from Dobie in 1854 but offered it as security against a large loan. The property was transferred to the Official Assignee of the Insolvent Estate of Edward James Blaxland in 1860 and subsequently leased to the Methodist Church, who established Newington College on the site. The property, extending from near the current Holker Street to the current Carnarvon Street, was sold to John Wetherill in 1877.\n\nCoal mining explorations were undertaken by Blaxland in 1841. He dug several six metre pits which gained the interest of the Australian Mining Company. The two parties reached agreement and, subsequently, undertook several unsuccessful explorations. In 1878, the City of Sydney Coal Company acquired the right to bore for coal at the site. The company drilled to 457 metres with no success. In 1855 the Australian Timber Company formed to exploit the timber stands in the Newington and surrounding areas. In the late 1870s and 1880s, Sydney's suburbs were expanding rapidly and it was hoped that the creation of a residential settlement between the large centres of Sydney and Parramatta would be a profitable exercise. This did not prove to be the case.\n\nIn 1878, John Wetherill registered a subdivision plan for the entire 520 hectare Newington Estate. This proposal comprised an extensive grid layout, of some 114 lots, which extended well into the mud flats and mangroves of Wentworth Bay and Homebush Bay. In 1906 and 1909, Wetherill further subdivided his property as \"Riverside Heights\", with the first allotments sold in that year. It was hoped that the location of the subdivision in close proximity to the developing State Abattoir and Brickworks would attract people to the area in association with the employment opportunities offered by these establishments. This venture was largely unsuccessful, with only a few lots being sold. However the layout of the western part of the Newington subdivision remains obvious in the current street pattern and street names.\n\nThe Newington Estate was first offered to the Government for use as an Asylum for the Insane in 1874. The Government did not accept this offer, however in 1879, Government Architect James Barnet prepared a report on the suitability of the Newington estate for a Reformatory School for Boys. His report concluded that the site was suitable for a Boys Reformatory or a Benevolent Asylum for Aged Women. In September 1897 the Crown Solicitor confirmed that 5000 pounds would be paid to John Wetherill to acquire about 19 hectares of land, which included Newington House.\n\nA then new Aged Women's Asylum was constructed to replace the existing asylum which was housed within the Immigrant Depot at the Hyde Park Barracks. The first buildings were established in 1886 on this new site to house 300 patients. At this time, the hospital was categorised as a state asylum for dependent adults' with infirmity or illness of 'incurable character'. Various additional buildings and structures were added to the Newington Hospital over the years. In 1960 it was proposed that the hospital should be closed and the site sold to industry. The significance of the site, however, stimulated significant public opposition to the plans. In 1968, after a series of drawn out negotiations, the Government of the day decided to close the hospital and transfer the property to the then NSW Department of Prisons. Some of the buildings are preserved in the grounds of the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre where they are still in use.\nIn the late 1990s the site was developed by Mirvac and Lend Lease for the purpose of an athletes village for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. Post the games the site was developed into a new residential suburb by Mirvac.\n\nNewington Marketplace is an outdoor shopping centre featuring a Woolworths supermarket and specialty shops, cafes and restaurants. Newington also features a number of commercial buildings providing office and warehouse space.\n\n\n\n"}

A hero appeared and drove the lion away, but Maria's parents wanted to find out where the Lion came from and what its purpose was. They set out on a journey, and never returned. The player takes control when, one day, Maria decides to go look for them. As she begins her journey, a bridge gives way beneath her, and she is washed away by a strong river current. She awakens in a strange new world and must find her lost parents and a way home, while looking for the mysterious White Lion.\n\nUpon the game's release, the game received a total score of 25/40 from the four reviewers at \"Famitsu\". \"Nintendo Power\" called the game a \"good, solid entry in the role-playing category\". The review found the game similar to the \"Dragon Warrior\" series, and made note of its female heroine as the game's \"biggest difference\".\n\nRetrospectively, \"Game Informer\" gave it a score of 6.5/10, opining that \"the ability to summon spirits is neat, but the game's bland art style and repetitive nature fail to amount to anything worth mentioning. If it weren't for the chick who looks like a dude on the [North American] cover, \"Legend of the Ghost Lion\" would be lost to obscurity forever.\" In an article about \"Dragon Quest\" clones, the staff of 1UP.com called it \"a strange game where every part that wasn't taken directly from \"Dragon Quest\" was straight out of a fever dream.\"\n"}
{"id": "2106212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106212", "title": "Gravikord", "text": "Gravikord\n\nThe gravikord is a modern, 24 string, electric double bridge-harp invented by Robert Grawi in 1986, which is closely related to both the West African kora and the kalimba. It was designed to employ a separated double tonal array structure making it possible to easily play cross-rhythms in a polyrhythmic musical style in a modern electro-acoustic instrument. There is a similar instrument, also developed by Grawi, the gravi-kora, which is tuned identically to a traditional 21 string African kora.\n\nThe gravikord is a new instrument developed on the basis of the West African kora. It is made of welded stainless steel tubing, with 24 nylon strings but no resonating gourd or skin. The bridge is made from a machined synthetic material with an integral piezo-electric sensor. Two handles located in elevation near the middle of the bridge allow holding the instrument. The bridge is curved to follow the arc of a strum from the hands which hold the shortened raised handles directly in the palms. A metal crossbar at the top of the bridge functions as a mechanical tone control and bridge stabilizer. The instrument connects to an amplifier like an electric guitar.\n\nThe playing technique is similar to that of the kora: the player plucks the strings with the thumb and index finger of each hand. Because each hand can play \"with\" or \"against\" each other, simple techniques can produce music of great rhythmic complexity. The tuning of the gravikord is not the same as a traditional Kora, and playing techniques are not directly compatible.\n\nBecause of the deep cultural significance of cross-rhythms to Sub-Saharan African music, several instruments have evolved there which are constructed in such a way as to more easily generate cross-rhythms. These instruments organize the notes in a uniquely divided alternate array – not in the straight linear bass to treble structure that is so common to many western instruments such as the piano, harp, marimba, etc... Instruments such as the West African kora, and Doussn'gouni, part of the harp-lute family of instruments, and thumb piano type instruments such as the kalimba and mbira also have this separated double tonal array structure.\n\nOn these instruments one hand of the musician is not primarily in the bass nor the other primarily in the treble, but both hands can play freely across the entire tonal range of the instrument. Also the fingers of each hand can play separate independent rhythmic patterns and these can easily cross over each other from treble to bass and back, either smoothly or with varying amounts of syncopation. This can all be done within the same tight tonal range, without the left and right hand fingers ever physically encountering each other. These simple rhythms will interact musically to produce complex cross rhythms including repeating on beat/off beat pattern shifts that would be very difficult to create by any other means. This characteristically African structure allows often simple playing techniques to combine with each other and produce polyrhythmic music of great beauty and complexity.\n\nCreated by Robert Grawi to satisfy the need for an instrument easier to play polyrhythms on than the guitar, its design evolved over several years. During 1973–74 the first model made was acoustic having a bamboo and fiberglass basket resonator with animal skin head and large bamboo neck. Although taking inspiration from the West African kora, these first gravikords already differed from the kora by having the tuning mechanisms removed from the neck and placed at the base, and an extensively re-designed bridge which also featured a kalimba incorporated into it that could be played simultaneously with the strings. Its tuning also differed from the kora as it had 25 strings that were tuned symmetrically using a variation of the Hugh Tracey kalimba tuning system as a basis that he thought would be more open to western musicians. Several one of a kind prototypes were also created during this period using wood, aluminum, and other materials, also having different features including stereo output and variable pitch.\n\nFeatured in Book- As noted in the book \"Gravikords, Whirlies and Pyrophones\" by Bart Hopkin – \"The design quickly evolved to a more distinctive form. In today's Gravikord the body is made entirely of welded stainless steel tubing, lightweight but strong. There is no resonator; the tones of the twenty-four strings are amplified by means of a piezo-electric pickup in the bridge...The design is thoroughly ergonomic, made for natural and comfortable playing in a sitting or standing position.\" \nNew York Times- Interest in the instrument was shown by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, which included it in the show \"Enduring Rhythms\" (New York City, October 3, 1996 – August 3, 1997). In an article about this exhibit from \"The New York Times\", Rita Reif writes \"Some of the most innovative instruments in the show come from the 20th century when African rhythms became part of jazz, rock, pop, and Latin American dance music as well as gospel and even classical music. The show stoppers include a Gravikord, an electronically amplified stringed instrument that sounds like an earthy harp. In their shapes and sounds, Mr. Moore (curator of the show) said, these instruments also represent a kind of continuity in 'the layered rhythms, the mixed timbres, and all that movement which is so African.'\"\n\nRecognition - The notability of the instrument was also featured in an article by Tom Mulhern in \"Guitar Player Magazine\" –\"Even though the Gravikord has a high-tech, modern-sculpture look, it actually has its roots in the African kora, a double strung harp... polyrhythmic music, plus the sound of the Japanese koto, African kalimba (thumb piano) and the African kora...he (Grawi) began experimenting with bamboo double-strung harps that would allow him to perform separate melodies or accompaniments with each hand. Influences range from jazz, Dixieland, to Balinese gamelan and American folk music.\" This article also includes a technical description of the instrument as well as a patent drawing of the Gravikord.\n\nVanity Fair - In an article by Elvis Costello in \"Vanity Fair\" he places the recording \"Gravikords, Whirlies and Pryophones\" in a list of the finest 500 albums of all time that should be in any audiophile's collection.\n\nGravikord at the Met - In March 2018, the Gravikord became a permanent exhibit in the Andre Mertens Galleries for Musical Instruments within the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe gravikord is tuned to a diatonic scale. Its standard scale is in the key of G major/E minor. It has 24 strings, 12 strings on each side, and is structured like an extended Hugh Tracey kalimba, an already westernized African Instrument. The range of notes on both sides are the same and tuning is strictly in an alternate arrangement (except for the lowest bass note), so that the playing is equivalent between the left and right hands. This is reflected in the way the holes are drilled in the neck and the choice of string lengths and weights. A constant finger picking pattern will produce a constant musical pattern throughout the instruments range.\n\nThroughout the playing range the notes of a scale rise strictly alternately and symmetrically, always right, left, right, left, etc. making all the intervals of adjacent strings on each side of the bridge in major or minor thirds. Directly opposite strings are consecutive notes in a scale. Octaves switch sides and are always in a constant spacing. Like on the kora, the player tunes the instrument before playing in the scale he wants.\n\nGravikord general diatonic tuning:\n\nLeft: Sol1, Fa2, La2, Do3, Mi3, Sol3, Ti3, Re4, Fa4, La4, Do5, Mi5.\n\nRight: Do2, Mi2, Sol2, Ti2, Re3, Fa3, La3, Do4, Mi4, Sol4, Ti4, Re5.\n\nTuning in G major / E minor:\n\nLeft Hand: D, C, E, G, B, D, F#, A, C, E, G, B.\n\nRight: G, B, D, F#, A, (middle)C, E, G, B, D, F#, A.\n\nAlthough the gravikord is closely related to the African kora, the musical knowledge of griots and traditional kora players does not directly transfer to gravikord playing. The notes are not where they expect them to be and the bridge and hand playing positions are also different. For these musicians the gravi-kora was developed by Robert Grawi.\n\nThe gravi-kora is set up tonally just like traditional koras. It has 21 strings, 11 on left hand, and 10 on right hand side. The instrument is held by hooking the smallest fingers around the long handles which are positioned below the straight sided bridge. The hand placement is above these handles which enables easy string muting while playing with the hand pads. But the range of notes is not the same on both sides of the bridge. The left side is shifted more to the bass register starting with a cluster of the four lowest notes together. The right side is skewed more to the treble, ending with a cluster of the three highest notes on the right side. This is reflected in the way the holes for the strings are drilled in the neck, and the length and weight of strings used. This results in a unique asymmetric layout of tones where most of the strings directly opposite each other in the middle section of the bridge are tuned in octaves except for the bass cluster in the left hand and the treble cluster in the right. This is a standard popular kora tuning.\n\nGravi-kora general diatonic tuning:\n\nLeft: Fa1, Do2, Re2, Mi2, Sol2, Ti2, Re3, Fa3, La3, Do4, Mi4.\n\nRight: Fa2, La2, Do3, Mi3, Sol3, Ti3, Re4, Fa4, Sol4, La4.\n\nTuning in F major / D minor:\n\nLeft Hand: F, C, D, E, G, Bb, D, F, A, C, E.\n\nRight: F, A, (middle)C, E , G, Bb, D, F, G, A.\n\nAlthough to the casual observer these two instruments look very much alike, the playing experience and the advanced techniques developed by the musicians dedicated to each are very different.\n\nAlthough both instruments are tuned normally to a diatonic scale, on slower pieces, accidentals can be created by sharping individual notes. This is accomplished by pushing and tensioning the section of the string behind the bridge with one finger while playing the string normally. This is similar to a technique used in Japanese koto playing. For faster chromatic pieces a pedal called a pitch shifter can be used to make the instrument fully chromatic. The pedal can be set to momentarily jump shift the entire instrument's tuning one-half step up or down, or it can be set on continuous pitch shift change which enables playing the instrument in dobro, slide guitar, or pedal steel guitar styles.\n\nSince the instruments produce no conflicting acoustic sound, the gravikord and the gravi-kora can be easily played with all kinds of guitar effects: vibrato, delay, distortion, reverb units, wah-wah pedals, or pitch shifters that allow chromatic playing.\n\nGravikord\n\nMusic for the gravikord can be written in the normal grand staff method using the G clef and F clef.\n\nAlso people who do not know music theory can play standard music scores. The gravikord has a property that simplifies the reading of musical notation and the transposition of music written in other key signatures for playing on the instrument. It can be done directly from the music using a mental method. Because of its double structure and symmetric tuning system, all the notes on one side of the bridge correspond to the lines of the musical staff and all the notes on the other side correspond to the staff spaces. So, whatever key the music is written in, determine where the root note is of the scale. The method is then to mentally let this be the position of the instruments root note \"G\" for example. If the written note is on a staff line, let that staff line represent the \"G\" string on the gravikord and all the other strings on that side of the bridge will correspond spatially and sequentially to the other staff lines, all the notes on the opposite side of the bridge will correspond spatially and sequentially to the staff spaces. If the written musical root lies in a space then the opposite is true. Now the staff itself accurately represents spatially the strings and the notes on the gravikord and one can read the music as if it were written in a tablature designed for the gravikord. The position of the written notes on the staff directly indicate which string to play on the instrument.\n\nGravi-kora\n\nMusic for gravi-kora can be written in the normal grand staff method using the G clef and F clef.\n\nHowever, gravi-kora scores can also be written on a single G clef, following the Keur Moussa system. This notation system was created for the kora by Brother Dominique Catta, a monk of the Keur Moussa Monastery (Senegal). The seven low notes that should be written on the F clef are replaced by Arabic or Roman numerals and written on the G clef. More than 200 scores already written for kora solo or kora and Western instruments can therefore be played on the gravi-kora.\n\nGravikord\n\nBob (Robert) Grawi has recorded several CDs, as a solo player and with the Gravikord Duo and the Gravikord Ensemble (The Gravikord Duo consists of Bob Grawi, gravikord and percussion, and Pip Klein, flute; The Gravikord Ensemble adds David Dachinger, bassoon): \"Making Waves\", 1988, Take That Music; \"Rising Tide\", 1991, Take That Music; \"Cherries & Stars\", 1996, Take That Music.\nPeter Pringle of Canada has recorded an improvisation for gravikord & theremin. Ziko Hart of Australia has recorded original solo music on the gravikord. The jazz guitarist Kazumi Watanabe of Japan has produced a broadcast Japanese TV video and is also a gravikord owner.\n\nGravi-kora\n\nFoday Musa Suso featured an early version of the gravi-kora in recordings with Herbie Hancock, and on Suso's CD \"New World Power\". The Gravi-kora was adopted by Daniel Berkman of San Francisco and Jacques Burtin of Spain who are well known musicians and who have also produced their own original recordings with the instrument.\n\n\nThe Gravikord has received its own entry describing the instrument in detail in the latest published edition of the multi-volume \"Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments\" Second Edition, edited by Laurence Libin, on page 469.\n\nOther articles describing or referencing the gravikord have appeared in\nthe following publications: \"Curio Magazine\", \"Daily News\", \"Dirty Linen\", \"Experimental Musical Instruments\", \"Folk Harp Journal\", \"Gravikords Whirlies & Pyrophones\", \"Guitar Player Magazine\", Metropolitan Museum of Art, \"New Sounds\", \"Science News\", \"Smithsonian Magazine\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Vanity Fair\", among others.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Australian Senate for the state of Queensland from July 1999 to May 2016, representing the Australian Labor Party. Ludwig served in a range of portfolios in the first Rudd and the second Gillard ministries until his resignation from Cabinet as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery, in 2013.\n\nLudwig was born in Longreach and has lived and worked in various locations throughout regional Australia. He is married and lives in Brisbane with his wife and two daughters. His father, Bill Ludwig, is National President of the Australian Workers' Union, one of Australia's largest trade unions, and is a powerful figure in the Queensland branch of the Labor Party. Ludwig (junior) was educated at the University of Queensland, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, the Queensland University of Technology, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, and the Australian National University, where he completed a Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice.\n\nLudwig began his career as an Industrial Inspector and Training Consultant, before moving to the Queensland Branch of the Australian Workers' Union. Prior to entering the Australian Senate, Ludwig was a barrister and served with the Australian Army Reserve.\n\nA member of the Australian Labor Party since 1978, Ludwig was elected to the Senate in 1998, 2004 and 2010. Senator Ludwig was a Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate 2000–01, and was elected to the Opposition Shadow Ministry in October 2004 as Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs and Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate. He was promoted to Shadow Attorney-General and Manager of Opposition Business in March 2007 following the resignation of Kelvin Thomson.\n\nLudwig was appointed Minister for Human Services following the 2007 federal election. He was the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, under both the Rudd and Gillard governments until 2012.\n\nLudwig was promoted to Cabinet Secretary and Special Minister of State in June 2009.\n\nFollowing the 2010 federal election, Ludwig was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. As Minister he has been responsible for significant reforms to the industry. Following the airing of animal cruelty to Australian cattle in Indonesian abattoirs, the Government temporarily suspended the live export trade while strict animal welfare standards to the trade were introduced.\n\nOn 5 January 2011 he was given the added responsibility of Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery. In that role Ludwig has overseen the Commonwealth's response to major natural disasters in Queensland, including the 2010-11 floods, Cyclone Yasi and the January 2013 Eastern Australia floods. He has been responsible for negotiating additional assistance measures directly with the Queensland Government and local councils. Following those discussions, the Queensland Support Package was announced by the Prime Minister in February 2013.\n\nIn 2013 Ludwig unveiled three policies for agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The Farm Finance package was released in Townsville with the Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan after direct meetings with farm groups and finance providers. In May the National Drought Reform Program agreement was signed between the Federal Government and all states and territories, bringing long standing discussions to a close. Ludwig said that it would end an old system that was unfair. Finally, Ludwig launched the National Food Plan in late May 2013, providing a roadmap for Australia's future food to support increased exports and global demand for Australian food.\n\nLudwig resigned from the Cabinet following the June 2013 leadership spill after supporting Julia Gillard. He issued a statement to advise that he would not take an appointment to the Cabinet under the leadership of Kevin Rudd in 'good faith' to the party and the leadership. Ludwig stated that he was proud of his achievements and the achievements of the Labor government.\n\nOn 9 March 2015 Ludwig announced he would not contest the next Senate election. His Senate term ended at the double dissolution of 9 May 2016.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2106235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106235", "title": "Contrabass saxophone", "text": "Contrabass saxophone\n\nThe contrabass saxophone is the second-lowest-pitched extant member of the saxophone family proper. It is extremely large (twice the length of tubing of the baritone saxophone, with a bore twice as wide, standing 1.9 meters tall, or 6 feet 4 inches) and heavy (approximately 20 kilograms, or 45 pounds), and is pitched in the key of E, one octave below the baritone saxophone.\n\nThe contrabass saxophone was part of the original saxophone family as conceived by Adolphe Sax, and is included in his saxophone patent of 1846, as well as in Kastner's concurrently published \"Methode\" for saxophone. By 1849, Sax was displaying contrabass through sopranino saxophones at exhibitions. Patrick Gilmore's famous American band roster included a contrabass saxophone in 1892, and at least a dozen of these instruments were built by the Evette-Schaeffer company for the US military bands in the early 20th century. Saxophone ensembles were also popular at this time, and the contrabass saxophone was an eye-catching novelty for the groups that were able to obtain one. By the onset of the Great Depression, the saxophone craze had ended, and the contrabass, already rare, almost disappeared from public view.\n\nIn recent years, however, the contrabass saxophone has experienced a resurgence in interest. Although still quite rare, perhaps partly due to its great expense, three manufacturers now produce contrabass saxophones: Benedikt Eppelsheim of Munich, Germany Romeo Orsi Wind Instruments of Milan, and J’Elle Stainer of São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nDue to its large body and wide bore, the sound of the contrabass saxophone has great acoustical presence and a very rich tone. It can be smooth and mellow, or harsh and buzzy depending on the player, and on the mouthpiece and reed combination used. Its middle and upper registers are warm, full, and expressive. Because its deepest tones vibrate so slowly (as with the contrabassoon or pedal notes on a pipe organ) it can be difficult for listeners to perceive individual pitches at the bottom of its range; instead of hearing a clearly delineated melody, listeners may instead hear a series of rattling tones with little pitch definition. However, when these tones are reinforced by another instrument playing at the octave or fifteenth, they sound clearly defined and have tremendous resonance and presence. In some contemporary jazz/classical ensembles the contrabass saxophone doubles the baritone saxophone either at the same pitch or an octave below, depending on the register of the music.\n\nWhile there are few orchestral works that call specifically for the contrabass saxophone, the growing number of contrabass saxophonists has led to the creation of an increasing body of solo and chamber music literature. It is particularly effective as a foundation for large ensembles of saxophones. As an example, the eminent saxophonist Sigurd Raschèr (1907-2001) played the instrument in his Raschèr Saxophone Ensemble, and it is featured on most of the albums by the Nuclear Whales Saxophone Orchestra. The Scottish composer Alistair Hinton has included parts for soprano, alto, baritone and contrabass saxophones in his Concerto for 22 Instruments completed in 2005.\n\nIn recent years, the rock group Violent Femmes have incorporated the contrabass saxophone into the band's live performances as well as their newest albums. Blaise Garza's contrabass saxophone often doubles the bass guitar, and is featured heavily on their ninth studio album We Can Do Anything.\n\nThe contrabass saxophone has most frequently been used as a solo instrument by woodwind players in the genres of jazz and improvised music who are searching for an extreme or otherworldly tone. The difficulty of holding and controlling the instrument (let alone playing it) makes performing on the instrument a somewhat theatrical experience in and of itself. On older instruments, playing is difficult too; it takes an enormous amount of air to sound notes in the low register. Thanks to refinements in their acoustical designs and keywork, modern contrabass saxophones are no more difficult to play than most other saxophones.\n\nAn increasing number of performers and recording artists are making use of the instrument, including Anthony Braxton, Paul Cohen, David Brutti, Jay C. Easton, Randy Emerick, Blaise Garza, Marcel W. Helland, Robert J. Verdi, Joseph Donald Baker, Thomas K. J. Mejer, Douglas Pipher, Scott Robinson, Klaas Hekman, Daniel Gordon, Daniel Kientzy, and Todd A. White. It is also used by saxophone ensembles including the Raschèr Saxophone Orchestra Lörrach, Saxophone Sinfonia, National Saxophone Choir of Great Britain, Northstar Saxophone Quartet, Koelner Saxophone Mafia, Toronto-based Allsax4tet and the Nuclear Whales Saxophone Orchestra.\n\n"}

An usul can be as short as two beats or as long as 128 beats. Usul is often translated as \"meter\", but usul and meter are not exactly the same. Both are repeating rhythmic patterns with more or less complex inner structures of beats of differing duration and weight. But a student learning Turkish music in the traditional \"meşk\" system first memorizes the usul kinetically by striking the knees with the hands. The student then sings the vocal or instrumental composition while performing the underlying usul. This pedagogical system helps the student memorize the composition while internalizing the underlying rhythmic structure.\n\nUsul patterns have standard pronounceable vocables built from combinations of the syllables \"düm\", \"dü-üm\", \"tek\", \"tekkyaa\", \"teke\", \"te-ek\", where düm, dü-üm indicate a strong low beat of single or double duration, and tek, tekkya, teke, te-ek indicate various combinations of light beats of half, single or double duration. Long \"usul\"s (e.g., 28/4, 32/4, 120/4) are compound metric structures that underlie longer sections of entire compositions. \n\nIn Ottoman times, the usul was realized by drummers. Drums are generally omitted in modern performances except for Mevlevi. When performing music for the Mevlevi ceremony, drummers traditionally play embellished (\"velveleli\") versions of the usuls.\n\nInstrumental improvisations (\"taksim\") and vocal improvisations (\"gazel\", \"mersiye\", etc.) are generally performed in \"free\" rhythm, with no usul.\n\nThe melodic counterpart to usul rhythmic mode is \"makam\" melodic mode.

It is a type of implied trust, i.e., it is created by conduct, not explicitly by a settlor.\n\nIn a constructive trust the defendant breaches a duty owed to the plaintiff. The most common such breach is a breach of fiduciary duty, such as when an agent wrongfully obtains or holds property owned by a principal. A controversial example is the case of \"Attorney-General for Hong Kong v Reid\", in which a senior prosecutor took bribes not to prosecute certain offenders. With the bribe money, he purchased property in New Zealand. His employer, the Attorney-General, sought a declaration that the property was held on constructive trust for it, on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty. The Privy Council awarded a constructive trust. The case is different from \"Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver\", because there was no interference with a profit-making opportunity that properly belonged to the prosecutor. \n\nBeing a Privy Council decision, \"Reid\" did not overrule the previous decision of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in \"Lister v Stubbs\" which held the opposite, partially because a trust is a very strong remedy that gives proprietary rights to the claimant not enjoyed by the defendant's other creditors. In the event of the defendant's insolvency, the trust assets are untouchable by the general creditors. Supporters of \"Lister\" suggested that there was no good reason to put the victim of wrongdoing ahead of other creditors of the estate. There was a tension in English law between \"Lister\" and \"Reid\" which was highlighted in \"Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd\". The United Kingdom Supreme Court subsequently overruled \"Sinclair\" in \"FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC\", holding that \"Lister\" was no longer good law.\n\nIn \"Foskett v McKeown\" a trustee used trust money together with some of his own money to purchase a life insurance policy. Then he committed suicide. The insurance company paid out to his family. The defrauded beneficiaries of the trust sought a declaration that the proceeds were held on constructive trust for them. The House of Lords said that the beneficiaries could choose between either: (a) a constructive trust over the proceeds for the proportion of the life insurance payout purchased with their money; or (b) an equitable lien over the fund for the repayment of that amount. \n\nThere is controversy as to what the true basis is of this trust. The House of Lords said that it was to vindicate the plaintiffs' original proprietary rights. However, this reasoning has been criticized as tautologous by some scholars who suggest the better basis is unjust enrichment (see below). This is because there must be a reason why a new property right is created (i.e. the trust) and that must be because otherwise the family would be unjustly enriched by receiving the proceeds of the insurance policy purchased with the beneficiaries' money. \"Interference with the plaintiff's property\" can justify why the plaintiff can get its property back from a thief, but it cannot explain why new rights are generated in property for which the plaintiff's original property is swapped. \n\nIn \"Foskett v McKeown\", the plaintiff's original property was an interest in the trust fund. The remedy they obtained was a constructive trust over an insurance payout. It is not obvious why such a new right should be awarded without saying it is to reverse the family's unjust enrichment.\n\nIn \"Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd\" one bank paid another bank a large sum of money by mistake (note that the recipient Bank did not do anything wrong - it just received money not owed to it). Goulding J held that the money was held on (constructive) trust for the first bank. The reasoning, in this case, has been doubted, and in \"Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council\" the House of Lords distanced itself from the idea that unjust enrichment raises trusts in the claimant's favour. This remains an area of intense controversy. \n\nThese type of trusts are called '\"institutional\" constructive trusts'. They arise the moment the relevant conduct (breach of duty, unjust enrichment etc.) occurs. They can be contrasted with '\"remedial\" constructive trusts', which arise on the date of judgment as a remedy awarded by the court to do justice in the particular case. \n\nAn example is the Australian case \"Muschinski v Dodds\". A de facto couple lived in a house owned by the man. They agreed to make improvements to the property by building pottery shed for the woman to do arts and crafts work in. The woman paid for part of this. They then broke up. The High Court held that the man held the property on constructive trust for himself and the woman in the proportions in which they had contributed to the improvements to the land. This trust did not arise the moment the woman commenced improvements - that conduct did not involve a breach of duty or an unjust enrichment etc. The trust arose at the date of judgment, to do justice in the case. \n\nIn \"Bathurst City Council v PWC Properties\", the High Court that as constructive trusts are the most severe remedy in cases of breach of fiduciary duty, they should only be imposed when other remedies are inappropriate in providing relief.\n\nFor example, if the defendant steals $100,000 from the plaintiff and uses that money to buy a house, the court can trace the house back to the plaintiff's money and deem the house to be held in trust for the plaintiff. The defendant must then convey title to the house to the plaintiff, even if rising property values had appreciated the value of the house to $120,000 by the time the transaction occurred. If the value of the house had instead \"depreciated\" to $80,000, the plaintiff could demand a remedy at law (money damages equal to the amount stolen) instead of an equitable remedy.\n\nThe situation would be different if the defendant had mixed his own property with that of the plaintiff, for example, adding $50,000 of his own money to the $100,000 stolen from the plaintiff and buying a $150,000 house or using plaintiff's $100,000 to add a room to defendant's existing house. The constructive trust would still be available but in proportion to the contributions, not wholly in the claimant's favour. Alternatively, the claimant could elect for an equitable lien instead, which is like a mortgage over the asset to secure repayment.\n\nBecause a constructive trust is an equitable device, the defendant can raise all of the available equitable defenses against it, including unclean hands, laches, detrimental reliance, and undue hardship.\n\n"}

He has one sister, Miriam.\n\nRamzy began his career at the age of 10. A scout from Tersana club saw him and tried to persuade him to join the youth team in the club but his father Guda Ramzy – one of Al-Ahly's fans – refused to have his son join Tersana or Al-Zamalek clubs.\nSo his father and his uncle took him to Al Ahly, Captain Mustafa Hussein saw him and decided to put him in the youth club of the red castle. Step by step, Ramzy joined the youth national team at less than 17 years old; Captain Ahamad Rafat was his coach in this time.\n\nDespite his young age, Ramzy's playing ability earned him a spot on Al Ahly's first team. Captain Mahmoud El-Gohary also picked him for the Egyptian National Team's journey to the World Cup in Italy. That was the key of success for the 20-year-old player and soon he became Egypt's youngest professional.\n\nIn 1990, he started his professional career with the Swiss club Neuchâtel Xamax, as a centre-half. The Swiss nicknamed him \"The Rock.\"\n\nIn summer 1994, Ramzy was the first Egyptian player in the Bundesliga as he joined the German Club SV Werder Bremen with a $1.5 million transfer fee to become the most expensive player in Egypt.\n\nAfter the 1998 African Nations Cup, Ramzy joined the Red Devils of 1. FC Kaiserslautern with his mate in the Egyptian national team Samir Kamona and wore jersey number six. Ramzy was famous in Kaiserslautern as he scored 12 goals from the center back position but in April 2003 after a knee injury, Ramzy spent two seasons in agony as he watched from the sidelines until his contract came to an end.\n\nAfter Kaiserslautern released him, Ramzy told BBC that he intended to join Al-Wahda of the United Arab Emirates and would be traveling to negotiate his contract. But on 19 October 2005, Ramzy signed for 2. Bundesliga club 1. FC Saarbrücken for 18 months until 30 June 2007.\n\nDuring his knee injury, Ramzy started taking lectures about coaching in Berlin, Germany. He decided to become a manager after his retirement, so he started as a member in the coaching staff in Kaiserslautern's youth team.\n\nRamzy became the assistant for the German coach Rainer Zobel, head manager of Egyptian club ENPPI. Due to lack of success, in January 2007 the club decided to replace Zobel with Ramzy to the end of the season whatever the results were. Ramzy said that it was a big responsibility and a good step to open the door for young coaches to manage teams in Egypt.\n\nEnding the 2006–07 season in the ninth place, Ramzy returned to his original job as assistant coach. The club signed a contract with Egyptian coach Anwar Salama, the former manager of Petrol Assiut.\n\nIn the middle of September 2008, Ramzy took a new step toward the international training career, he became the assistant manager of the Egypt national football team U20 under the leadership of coach Miroslav Soukup. In late December 2009, he was named as the new head coach of the Egypt U-21 national football team.\n\nIn December 2009, it was announced that Ramzy had signed a two-year contract as the manager of the Egypt U-23 national football team.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2106319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106319", "title": "Jungle Movement of Gilan", "text": "Jungle Movement of Gilan\n\nThe Jangal (Jungle) Movement, in Gilan, was a rebellion against the monarchist rule of the Qajar central government of Iran. It lasted from 1915 to 1921.\n\nIn 1915, Mirza Kuchik Khan, an experienced activist in the Constitutional Revolution, launched the Jangal movement, which was religiously Islamic, in the forests of Gilan, demanding autonomous status for the province, an end to central government corruption, an end to foreign interference in affairs of local peoples, and land reform. Basically, even though the movement was not \"separatist\", \"bourgeois nationalist\", or communist, its main ideas were rooted in ridding the country of government corruption, \"foreign imperial domination,\" and opposition to the country's existing monarchy. With such goals, it is no surprise that the movement enjoyed strong support of the peasantry, working class, and poor population within Iran. Even so, Hooshang Amirahmadi describes the movement's leaders as \"merchants and landlords\" and Mirza as part of the \"democratic wing\" of the Iranian bourgeoisie.\n\nIn years that followed, the movement's guerrillas, Jangalis, fought against foreign invaders. While they were described as \"small landowners in Gilan\" that advocated armed insurgency, they were strong enough to resist the advances of the Russian Empire, leading the British to become the major military presence in the region instead. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Marxists within Iran became more organized and began collaborating with the Jangal movement, with many of these new revolutionaries directly influenced by the Bolsheviks. Later, these Marxists would end up forming the communist Tudeh Party. Even so, there were undoubtedly differences since Mirza supported land reforms but not land redistribution.\n\nNear the end of 1917, the Jangalis, organized a \"Unity of Islam\" committee, since they were affiliated with the Union of Islam movement, which was \"bourgeois-nationalist\" with democratic elements, with members on the committee mainly comprising landlords and merchants. Still, they drew up a proposed constitution which accepted \"private property in land\" with certain limitations but also called for equality, majority rule, and freedom. Even with this, the Jangalis failed to change relations between landlords and peasants, but they did continue to hold an anti-absolutist, anti-imperialist, and nationalist position displayed in their newspaper, \"Jangal\", launched in 1917. In years that followed, it was clear that the movement was gaining strength as disorder and insecurity swept the country.\n\nBy 1920, the Jangalis, who were broadly Shia Muslims, engaged in an uprising in which they demanded regional autonomy and national reforms. There was a turning point in the movement after the Red Army came into the Iranian port of Enzali. As a result, the Red Army and Jangalis agreed on the establishment of the bourgeois democratic and anti-British/anti-imperialist government in Gilan, while Mirza began secret negotiations with the central government to eliminate communists, leading to a coup in the Gilan government and later peace between the two forces.\n\nAfter this, the Jangalis were a key part of maintaining Soviet Republic of Gilan, showing that Marxists and Muslims could work together in a common cause. John Foran describes this collaboration:\n\nThe Communist Party of Iran, led by Haydar Khan Amoughlu, and the Jungle Movement, led by Mirza Kuchak Khan, had formed an alliance to build a soviet socialist republic. In addition, they sent a letter to Lenin asking for assistance in 'freeing us and all of the oppressed from the chain of Iranian and British oppressors.' They also sent a letter to Tehran proclaiming the monarch government illegitimate.\n\nThis Soviet republic would last close to two years before its leaders were killed and imprisoned. While the Soviet role in Iran was not clear, with questions on whether they were helping Iranians or helping establish a Soviet Republic in the country, there is no doubt that \"Marxist-Muslim cooperation\" as part of the Soviet Republic had a long-standing legacy on political and socialist organizing in the country, with one group of students organizing against the Shah in the 1960s called the \"Jangal Group.\"\n\nInitially, when commencing the movement, Mirza and his allies formed a union called \"Ettehad-e-Islam\" (The Islamic Union). Although in the beginning, they were in conformity over the aims of the movement, eventually the movement began witnessing considerable friction as some members had diverging tendencies toward Ahmad Shah Qajar while others such as Mirza specifically called for an Iranian \"Republic.\"\n\nNot only did Mirza specifically use the term \"Republic of Iran,\" as can be seen in his letters, but he had also declared his interest in a \"Republic\" before the advent of the Communist Party of Iran. In fact Mirza was removed from his posts in the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic only 17 days after the party's formation. Mirza did not seem to agree with Marxist ideology, being a devout man of faith, even though many of his allies until the end were members of the Communist Party.\n\nThe British did not take Mirza's successes lightly, and sent Captain Edward Noel to assassinate Mirza. The British captain was arrested before he could take any such action. Colonel Stokes and General Lionel Dunsterville (whose troops were lightly referred to as Dunsterforce) were further agitated by Mirza's refusal to let British troops pass through Gilan on their way up north, while Mirza had approved and guaranteed Russian troops returning north safe passage. British forces attacked Rasht as a result, and even bombed Mirza's residence using airplanes. An ultimatum was issued to Mirza by the British to surrender.\n\nThe Russians joined the British and sent in 20,000 troops to capture Mirza. Many prominent members of the movement such as \"Haj Ahmad Kasmai\", and Dr Talequani Heshmat surrendered, with 270 troops, and the latter was executed despite the immunity that he was granted.\n\nIn 1922, the Soviets came to an agreement with the Iranian government to withdraw their troops, especially those assisting the Gilan Republic, and soon after the English declared they would be withdrawing their troops. Ultimately, the Soviets told Mirza that the Soviet Republic, due to changed circumstances, was compromised. As a result, there was an internal conflict in which the leader of the communists, Heidar Amou Oqli, was killed, the \"Revolutionary Committee\" of the Soviet Republic falling apart, the Jangalis defeated by Reza Khan and Mirza, along with his German companion, freezing to death as they tried to escape Khan's men.\n\n\n"}

The regent at that time was the prime minister (\"Bendahara\" in Malay) Tun Perak. During his initial years as a young adult, the sultan was known to be a ruthless monarch. The administration of the sultanate was in the hands of an able and wise Tun Perak. After the death of Tun Perak in 1498, he was succeeded by a new Prime Minister Tun Mutahir. The death of Tun Perak changed Sultan Mahmud into a more responsible ruler.\n\nDuring Portuguese admiral Diogo Lopes de Sequeira's visit to Malacca from 1509–1510, the sultan planned to assassinate him. However, Sequeira learned of this plot and fled Malacca. When the famous Portuguese naval officer Afonso de Albuquerque received word, he decided to utilize this to embark upon his expeditions of conquest in Asia. Malacca was then subsequently attacked by the Portuguese in the Capture of Malacca (1511), during which the Sultan retreated to Muar, Johor and later further to Kampar, Sumatra and held a government there until his death in 1528.\n\nHe had several wives. Among the best known was Tun Teja. The sultan was also surrounded by able men and warriors such as Hang Tuah, Khoja Hassan and Hang Nadim. He had three sons; Sultan Ahmad Shah, Muzaffar I of Perak and Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor. Ahmad Shah succeeded Mahmud when Mahmud mistakenly killed the Bendahara Tun Mutahir and the Bendahara's family after Raja Mudaliar accused Mutahir of planning a rebellion. Ahmad Shah was deemed incompetent and was killed by Mahmud Shah himself in 1513 after a failed attempt to retake Malacca from the Portuguese. Mahmud Shah then reclaimed the throne, although by then the Malacca sultanate had been abolished, thus making him a pretender. Muzaffar went north to establish the Sultanate of Perak while Alauddin Riayat went on to found Sultanate of Johor.\n\nSultan Mahmud is associated with the Malay legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang which is about his failed courtship of a fairy princess. Sultan Mahmud is also said to have killed Tun Mutahir and the Bendahara's family members because Mutahir did not give his daughter, Tun Fatimah's hand in marriage to Sultan Mahmud. Tun Fatimah was married to Tun Ali.\n\n"}

This system, still expanding, is in part like a career-management system, in which a student's essential data are electronically stored and managed for employment counseling. Beyond these basics,the system also encourages entering assignments and volunteer and extracurricular activities into the portfolio as well as taking exams via it. Beyond that, students can add or create anything related to their education that they wish. Another aspect of the e-portfolio is the instructor's use. Instructors can post lectures and other materials for students as well as enter grades and other details of classes.\n\nIn 2012, Konyang University was one of 37 Korean universities that were selected by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology for the LINC (Leaders in INdustry-university Cooperation) program.

Despite its small size, Hong Kong is currently ranked the 15th largest exporting country in the world as of 2008. The total value of visible trade amounted to $3,548.2 billion in 2003, and exports totalled $362.1Bn in 2008. During the period of 2004 to 2007, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 7.3% in real terms, to HK$1,627.5 billion (US$208.7 billion) in 2007. Per capita GDP reached HK$235,134 (US$30,157).\n\nAt the end of 2007, 3.46 million of the 3.65 million labour force were employed full-time, 117,800 were unemployed and 75,500 were considered under-employed. The unemployment rate averaged 4.1% in 2007, the fourth straight year of decline. It has since then increased to 5.3% by 2009. In 2015, this has decreased to 3.4%.\n\nThe momentum in improving working conditions, Occupational Safety and health and employees' rights and benefits has been kept up through an extensive programme of labour legislation. Some 42 pieces of legislation were enacted between 1 and 2. More are in the pipeline. Hong Kong aims at applying relevant International labour standards as the local circumstances allow. As of 1 April 1577, Hong Kong is following 7 Conventions, exceeding most countries in the region.\n\nThe Employment Ordinance provides the framework for a comprehensive code of employment. It governs the payment of wages, the termination of employment contracts and the operation of employment agencies. The law provides statutory holidays with pay, sick leave, maternity protection, rest days, paid annual leave and employment protection for employees. All employees have statutory protection against anti-union discrimination. The law also provides for severance pay to workers made redundant, and long service payment to workers with long service who are dismissed for reasons other than redundancy, or on disciplinary grounds, who die in service, or who resign on grounds of ill health or old age. Employees who are owed wages, wages in lieu of notice and/or severance payments by insolvent employers may apply for ex-gratia payment from the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund which is financed by an annual levy on business registration certificates. The Employment of Children Regulations prohibit the employment of children aged under 15 in all industrial undertakings. Subject to certain protective restrictions, children aged 13 and 14 who are attending school may take up part-time employment in the non-industrial sectors. The Employment of Young Persons (Industry) Regulations govern the employment conditions of young persons aged 15 to 17 in industrial undertakings. These young persons are not allowed to work more than eight hours a day and 48 hours a week. Overtime work for them is prohibited. Eight special enforcement teams of labour inspectors are responsible for monitoring employers' compliance with various labour legislation to safeguard the rights and benefits of local and imported workers.\n\nHong Kong people have the right and freedom to form and join trade unions. At the end of December there were 654 registered trade unions, consisting of 610 employees' unions, 25 employers' associations and 19 mixed organisations of employers and employees. The total estimated membership was around 683,000. Hong Kong has an outstanding record of industrial peace. In 2001, it lost 0.26 working day per 999,000,000 workers. During the year, the Labour Department dealt with 31,698 labour problems, most of which were grievances involving claims of wages in arrears, wages in lieu of notice and holiday pay. There was one work stoppage, and the number of working days lost was 111.\n\nTo speed up the settlement of minor employment claims, the Minor Employment Claims Adjudication Board was set up in the Labour Department in 1994 for the adjudication of rights claimed under the Employment Ordinance and in accordance with individual employment contracts. The board hears claims by not more than 10 claimants for a sum not exceeding $8,000 per claimant. Hearings are conducted in public and procedures are simple and informal. Claims by more than 10 claimants, or more than $8,000 per claimant, are heard by the Labour Tribunal.\n\nThe tribunal comes under the Judiciary and provides a quick, inexpensive and informal forum for settling labour disputes. It hears employment claims for a sum of money arising from the breach of a term of a contract of employment or the failure to comply with the Employment Ordinance or the Apprenticeship Ordinance.\n\nThe Occupational Safety Officers of the Labour Department promote and protect the health and safety of employees in the industrial and non-industrial sectors. To reduce accidents and guard against ill-health, efforts are focused on legislative control, safety training, education and promotion. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, 31 sets of regulations have been made to cover various aspects of hazardous activities in factories, building and engineering construction sites, restaurants, catering establishments, commercial premises and other workplaces. , 126,470 inspections and 12,500 accident investigations were conducted. A total of 2 660 prosecutions were taken out with fines totalling $32.3 million. In 2001, 597 training courses on safety legislation for 6,391 people and 218 tailor-made briefing sessions for 6,874 employees in private and public sector organisations were given. Safety and health publications were distributed to members of the public through various outlets and 241 publication stands placed in major shopping centres, housing estates, clinics, transport stations, public utility service counters and government offices. The Occupational Safety Charter, setting out the rights of employees to enjoy a safe working environment and the employers' obligations to reduce the risk of accidents, remains a major promotion programme and as at the end of 2001, 558 organisations, including employer and employee bodies, have subscribed voluntarily to the charter. Five major publicity campaigns were launched in 2001, including a safety award scheme to promote safety in the catering industry, a programme to promote a greater awareness of occupational safety and health among small and medium enterprises, a safety award scheme to promote safety in the construction industry, a campaign to promote the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Safety Management) Regulation and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Loadshifting Machinery) Regulation, and production of two television Announcement in Public Interests and four radio Announcement in Public Interests.\n\nUnder the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, an employer is liable to pay compensation to an employee who suffers personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, or to eligible family members of an employee who is killed in an accident at work. All employers are required to have valid employees' compensation insurance policies to cover their liabilities both under the ordinance and at common law. The Employees' Compensation Ordinance is administered by the Employees' Compensation Division of the Labour Department, which handled 201 fatal accident cases and 67,540 non-fatal cases in 2001. Among these non-fatal cases, 10,722 were minor injury cases with sick leave not exceeding three days. The division also provides administrative support to the Employees' Compensation Assessment Board which assess the percentage of permanent loss of earning capacity suffered by injured employees. The Pneumoconiosis Compensation Office offers assistance to persons who have contracted pneumoconiosis or in case of their death their family members to obtain compensation from the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board which is financed by a levy on the construction and quarrying industries.\n\nFor employers and job-seekers, there are several ways to find an employment in Hong Kong, either through public channels provided by the Hong Kong Government, NGOs in Hong Kong, and student affairs offices of university, or private channels like employment agencies, apps, magazines, newspapers, and leaflets. Shops among Hong Kong may advertise their vacancies on their windows directly.\n\nFor those who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong, they need to seek a suitable visa from the Immigration Department before starting their employment in Hong Kong. Some visa applications may require proof from the employer, such as an employment contract. On the other hand, it is worth to note that not all kinds of visa issued by the Immigration Department will make the visa holder become eligible to be employed in Hong Kong, for example, a visa for visit or a visa for transit in Hong Kong. Employers in Hong Kong, who want to employ a non-permanent Hong Kong resident, they have to inspect the job-seekers' valid travel documents to ensure that they are free to take up any employment in Hong Kong without the Director of Immigration's prior permission and have not breached any condition of stay. To employ a person permitted to remain on visitor, student, employment condition or a person whose travel document is endorsed with a condition of stay that \"Employment is not permitted\", requires prior approval from the Director of Immigration. \n\nThe Labour Department provides free services for both employers and job-seekers. An employer, either from Hong Kong or even outside Hong Kong, can advertise its vacancies by submitting information to Job Vacancy Processing Centre of the Labour Department. After the vetting procedures complete, the job information will then be shown in the following channel maintained by the Labour Department: the website of Interactive Employment Service (iES) (http://www.jobs.gov.hk), on the job cards at the Job Centres and Recruitment Centres, on the Interactive Employment Service Mobile App (iES Mobile App), Vacancies Search Terminals among Hong Kong. Jobs openning to applicants attaining a university degree certificate are also available on the Higher Education Employment Information e-Platform (HEEIP) website maintained by the Labour Department. Apart from the channels aforementioned, job-seekers can find job information through the Telephone Employment Service Centre of the Labour Department.\n\nThrough the Job Matching Programme, the Job Centres provide briefing, intensive job-matching and counselling services to unemployed job-seekers. Employers and job-seekers may also make use of the Interactive Employment Service (iES) (http://www.jobs.gov.hk) provided by the department on the web to submit vacancy information or register for placement service. All vacancies received by the department are posted on the web site for public viewing. Members of the public may access the iES with internet connected personal computers, public computer facilities at district offices, community halls, public libraries and post offices, and public information kiosks distributed over Hong Kong.\n\nTo improve its operating environment and enhance the quality of service, the Labour Department has re-provisioned its Job Centres to include such facilities as briefing room, reading area and audio-visual corner for job-seekers. Telephones, fax machines and computers with internet connection are also available to facilitate job-seekers to search suitable jobs on the Internet, prepare resumes and make direct job applications with employers.\n\nThere are plenty of private channels for finding a job in Hong Kong, such as websites, apps, newspapers, magazines, employment agencies.\n\nThe Selective Placement Division provides free specialised employment assistance to people with disabilities seeking open employment. The service caters for the visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped, chronically ill, mentally handicapped and ex-mentally ill. During 2001, the division recorded 4,128 registrations and achieved 2,348 placements.\n\nTotal employment in the third quarter of 2007 was 3.52 million. The employment distribution among various industry sectors was as follows:\n\nHong Kong's economy has historically been driven by its status as one of the major transport and logistic hubs for East Asia. In more recent years, Hong Kong has seen other sectors become more important in its economy. Financial and banking services have become a much larger part of the high-end economy in Hong Kong and one of the major drivers of economic growth. The growth of these businesses has helped Hong Kong keep its position as one of the world's top economies.\n\nA minimum wage law was passed in Hong Kong in July 2010. It requires the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to propose a minimum wage level, which he will do for the first time in November 2010; the Legislative Council will either approve or reject the amount. The law does not give the Legislative Council the power to amend the amount, and it is not applicable to foreign domestic helpers, who, under legislation specifically governing the employment of foreign domestic helpers, earn a minimum of HK$3,580 per month. The wage level prevailing is essentially the result of interplay of supply and demand. Wages are usually calculated on hourly, daily, monthly, or piece rates. In September , the average monthly wage rate for the supervisory, technical, clerical and miscellaneous non-production workers was HK$11,712. Based on the wage indexes, the average wage rate for this group of workers rose by 1.8% per annum in 1995–2007, and by 1.5% per annum in real terms. The small difference is due to severe consumer price deflation. The overall average daily wage for the workers on public works construction projects was HK$565.60 at the end of 2007.\n\nIn November 2010, legislators of the Hong Kong SAR Government agreed to set a minimum wage level of HK$28 (UK£2.29 or US$3.60) per hour, which came into force the following May. In May 2013, this was raised to $30HKD per hour.\n\nEffective 1 May 2015, the minimum wage was raised to HK$32.50 per hour.\n\n\n"}

It is a side scrolling beat 'em up with some role-playing video game elements mixed in. The game was also released on the Sega Saturn, packaged with its sequel, \"\", under the title \"Dungeons & Dragons Collection\", although the Saturn version limited the gameplay to only two players. In 2013, both games were re-released for modern platforms as \"\". \n\n\"Tower of Doom\" is a side-scrolling arcade game featuring four different characters (cleric, dwarf, elf, fighter) fighting iconic \"Dungeons & Dragons\" monsters. Bosses include a troll that regenerates unless burned, a large black dragon, the dreaded \"Shadow Elf\" (Mystara's equivalent of the drow), a beholder, the optional superboss Flamewing (a great wyrm red dragon) and the final boss Deimos (an archlich).\n\nAt points in the game the players are presented with a choice of paths to take to continue progress. Each path goes to a different area, and it is impossible to visit every area in a single play.\n\nThe gameplay is more technical than the average on beat'em up games. In addition to the usual basic attacks and jumping it includes blocking, strong attacks, turning attacks, dashing attacks, crouching and evading. It also requires the use of careful tactics, as most enemies have the same abilities as the heroes and can out-range them, too.\n\nDaggers, hammers, arrows and burning oils can be used as throwing weapons, and many enemies have similar weapons. Spells can be used by means of magical rings or by the two playable spellcasters (a cleric and an elf).\n\n\nThe Republic of Darokin is under a terrible siege as the number of monsters and their attacks rise. A group of four adventurers step forth to rescue various areas, then are sent by the Corwyn Linton to investigate the attacks, revealed to be masterminded by the Archlich Deimos. Eventually the adventurers make their way to the Deimos' Tower of Doom and ultimately destroy him.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, Capcom acquired the license to create D&D games. As part of the deal, they ported Eye of the Beholder to the Super Nintendo. The Japanese branch of Capcom were having difficulty getting TSR's approval for creating a D&D game, so they turned to the US branch to negotiate. Capcom and license-holder TSR met in January 1992 to discuss how the game should be approached. They decided to write the game's story first, and build the game around the story. Most of the staff at Capcom USA were not familiar with D&D rules and lore, so assistant James Goddard, turned to D&D enthusiast Alex Jimenez to come up with a concept and making it understandable to Japanese, all the while testing the product. Some of Jimenez's inspirations for the beat em up' style came from Golden Axe, while the multiple paths were based on Thayer's Quest. There was debate between Capcom and SSI on whether to make the game Asian-themed or Western-themed, which Jimenez himself managed to resolve. Jimenez supplied concept art for the characters. One of his biggest difficulties was trying to help the Japanese developers grasp the D&D elements. Originally the game was supposed to have two buttons in the arcade controls, but two more were needed to cater for the inventory system.\n\nOnce the initial game design was complete, Alex Jimenez of Capcom USA translated it into an actual \"Dungeons & Dragons\" scenario and had his gamers group in San Jose play it, with Jimenez as gamemaster. Capcom of Japan then revised the scenario design based on the players' reactions. \n\nIn 1999, Capcom released both D&D video games as a two-disc compilation on the Sega Saturn titled \"Dungeons & Dragons Collection\" in Japan. \"Dungeons & Dragons Collection\" was never released in the United States and Europe. The ports have minor differences in gameplay, and there is a maximum of two players instead of the original four. Originally Capcom had planned to release the game as a standalone title on Sega Saturn and PlayStation, but cancelled the plan early on.\n\nCapcom announced at PAX East 2013 that they will release \"Tower of Doom\" and \"Shadow over Mystara\" as part of the \"Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara Collection\" for the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and Microsoft Windows in the summer of 2013.\n\nThe game received a rave review from \"GamePro\", who commented \"The action is not as fast as it could be, but it's furious, smoothly controlled, and intuitive.\" They also praised the game's length, complexity, and non-linear nature, and its faithful recreation of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" elements.\n\nAccording to GameSpy's Allen Rausch, \"Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom\" was \"Equally good, though not as well remembered\" as other \"\"Final Fight\"-style beat-'em-ups at the arcade\" like \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"\". Rausch felt that combat was \"fun, had more depth than you might expect from such a simple game, and came loaded with secrets to find and treasures to swipe\" and that after the players beat the game's seven levels, they \"found out that the game's ultimate bad guy was actually just the pawn of an even bigger bad guy who, naturally, would have to wait for the sequel to show up.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2106397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106397", "title": "Alexandre Pierre François Boëly", "text": "Alexandre Pierre François Boëly\n\nAlexandre Pierre François Boëly (19 April 1785, Versailles – 27 December 1858, Paris) was a French composer, organist, and pianist. Born into a family of musicians, Boëly received his first music lessons from his father, Jean François, who was a countertenor at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and a composer and harp teacher at the court of Versailles. He also studied under the Tyrolian pianist Ignaz Ladurner, who introduced him to the work of Bach and Haydn, which Boëly would champion in his adult career. Besides mastering the piano and organ, Boëly was also a talented violist.\n\nAs the Romantic movement swept through Europe during the 19th century, Boëly was shunned by the official mainstream of musical life in Paris because of his Classical sensibilities and his \"elitist\" fidelity to writing serious music. Boëly regarded with distaste the music that was written and feted by many of his contemporaries. The most popular standards during the Napoleonic period were compositions that swelled with patriotism or operatic intensity. Entrenching his reactionary reputation, he used his appointment as organist at Saint Germain l'Auxerrois in 1840 to promote the works of dead composers who were then only scantily appreciated by the public. These included Frescobaldi, Couperin, and most importantly of all, the supposedly impenetrable, unplayable Bach.\n\nSuch efforts did not win Boëly popular favor, for he was dismissed from his position in 1851 for the \"austerity\" of his playing. He died a simple piano teacher, but not without enjoying the respect and confidence of a close circle of friends which included Marie Bigot, Pierre Baillot, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, and Johann Baptist Cramer.\n\nAlthough Boëly was and remains largely unknown to the public, this does not diminish the part he played in the flourishing development of French music during the 19th century. He left behind an impressive oeuvre which numbers about 300 individual works, especially in the genres of chamber music and instrumental pieces for piano or organ. These include twelve books of practice-pieces of different styles and four books for organ with pedals or piano three hands. In Boëly's old age, he was sought out by two rising young artists, César Franck and Camille Saint-Saëns, who revered him as a guardian of a noble and pure classical organ tradition.\n\n\n"}

They formed in 2000 and originally disbanded in 2007. During this -year run, the group released records with four different record labels (most notably the independent record label Drive-Thru Records), including two full-length albums and three EPs. Hidden in Plain View played numerous venues, including The Capitol in Shamokin, Pennsylvania and concert tours such as the Warped Tour and the Drive-Thru Records Invasion Tours in the United States, Europe and Japan. They have since come back, and released an EP entitled 'Animal' via Rise Records.\n\nHailing from different towns around Hopatcong, New Jersey, Hidden in Plain View formed in August 2000, when former 8 over Par members Joe Reo (vocals) and Rob Freeman (guitar/backing vocals) merged with former Jersey Nonsense members Kenny Ryan (guitar) and Chris Amato (bass), as well as Derek Reilly (drums). The name \"Hidden in Plain View\" refers to a situation at singer Reo's day job in a supermarket, where a customer used the expression after needing help finding a blatantly visible item. With this original line-up, the band recorded a three-track demo and soon got in touch with the local record label DAB Records, who released their now sought after, Chris Badami produced, debut \"Find\" in March 2001.\n\nWith the label facing bankruptcy and the band substituting Jay Snyder for Reilly (who went on to form Red Light Green Light), Hidden in Plain View were picked up by Note to Self Records in early 2002. For their second EP titled \"\", the band exchanged their heavy distortion guitars and genre-typical fast-paced drums for a lighter, more uplifting sound, yet they still maintained a degree of melancholy, especially in the lyrics and vocal melodies. The CD was released on June 11, 2002. Before the end of the year, Ryan left to co-form Rushmore Records(now Drive-Thru Records) signing Houston Calls, while he was replaced by Mike Saffert.\n\nEven though a full-length had been announced by Note to Self, who had since been licensed by LLR Recordings, Hidden in Plain View signed with southern California pop punk label Drive-Thru Records in June 2003. Simultaneously with the announcement of their signing, LLR re-printed \"Operation: Cut-Throat\". The band went on and recorded four songs for their self-titled Drive-Thru debut. After the recording of the EP, Snyder left the band to start John Connor (Negative Progression Records). \"Hidden in Plain View\" was released in November 2003, featuring the liner notes picturing his replacement, Newnan, Georgia resident Spencer Peterson, born in Oil City, Pennsylvania. Peterson was a student at the Atlanta Institute of Music when he joined the band at the age of 19.\n\nRelease-wise, the following year was somewhat less busy for the band, with appearing only on the Counting Crows tribute album \"\" and the Drive-Thru Christmas compilation \"Happy Holidays from Drive-Thru Records\", though the band toured extensively in both the United States and the United Kingdom and recorded their first full-length album. \"Life in Dreaming\", which dropped in early 2005, showcased a much more mature, yet edgier and at times darker sound than the band's previous EPs, thanks to the latest two additions to their line-up, Saffert and Peterson.\n\nThe majority of 2005 was spent touring domestically and internationally, as the band played 24 dates of the Warped Tour, visited Japan for the first time and co-headlined the European Drive-Thru Invasion Tour 2005, which hit a total of sixteen cities in seven different countries across Europe. On October 16, 2005, Hidden in Plain View participated in MTV2's \"Dew Circuit Breakout\" (a television battle of the bands), competing in the New York City finals against Pete Miser.\n\nOn January 29, 2007, the band announced that they have broken up due to personal and creative differences. The follow-up record previously recorded, titled \"Resolution\", was released on Drive-Thru Records on July 24, 2007. The CD leaked onto file-sharing networks on July 15, 2007.\n\nOn April 16, 2013, Hidden in Plain View announced via their Twitter that they were reuniting for one show, at the Theater of the Living Arts in Philadelphia, PA. The show took place on September 7, 2013.\n\nIn 2015, the band announced that they were embarking on a tour in celebration of the 10 year anniversary of their debut album, \"Life In Dreaming\".

Today, 48 of these MiG 21 LanceRs are operational. The Romanian Air Force also operates C-130 Hercules, C-27J Spartan, An-26s transport planes and IAR-330 Puma helicopters. IAR-330 PUMA SOCAT helicopters have been modernized by the Romanian Aviation Industry in cooperation with Elbit Systems (Israel) for attack missions. The Romanian Air Force also includes locally built IAR-99 Șoim jet planes, in general only used for training of the young pilots. The remaining MiG-29s have been removed from service in 2003.\n\nDue to the old age of the MiGs, the Romanian Air Force is in the process of procurement of new fighters or possibly used fighters from partner states. Romania has signed a contract in 2013 with Portugal for 12 F-16 A/B Block 15 MLU fighters. The first six fighters have entered service with the Romanian Air Force in October 2016 while another three have been delivered in December. The last three will enter service during 2017.\n\nBeside the 12 F-16s bought from Portugal, Romanian authorities intend to buy at least another 24 F-16s, possibly newer Block 50 ones, in at least two batches of 12.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, the Romanian government decided to purchase VSHORAD/SHORAD systems from France. The deal included Mistral MANPADS and MICA VL surface-to-air missiles. However, after preliminary talks with MBDA in August, the deal was put on hold and canceled afterwards because of the defense cuts.\n\nIn February 2010, the Supreme Council of National Defense signed an agreement with the United States for missile defense under whose terms land-based SM-3 systems would be installed in Romania. On 3 May 2011, the president of Romania Traian Băsescu announced the location for the SM-3 systems: former Air Force base Deveselu in Olt County. The system includes 3 batteries with 24 SM-3 Block I rockets, manned by approximately 200 US soldiers (with a maximum of 500) under Romanian Air Force overall command. The Deveselu Aegis Ashore site has been declared operational on the 13th of May 2016.\n\nThe current chief of the Romanian Air Force Staff, succeeding Major General Fănică Cârnu on 19 December 2013, is Major General Laurian Anastasof.\n\nIn 1818, during the reign of John Caradja, the prince of Wallachia, an unmanned hot air balloon was flown off Dealul Spirii in Bucharest. On July 7, 1874, Colonel Nicolae Haralambie with Ion Ghica and a third person flew over Bucharest in a hydrogen balloon named \"Mihai Bravul\", which had made its first flight on June 9 of the same year.\n\nOn November 20, 1909 the Chitila Piloting School was formed as a joint venture by Mihail Cerchez. The school, conducted by French flight instructors, had five hangars, bleachers for spectators and shops where the Farman planes imported from France were assembled. The school opened on July 9, 1910, when the chief flight instructor and director of the school René Guillemin crashed a Farman III biplane from a height of during a demonstration flight and broke his leg.\n\nGuillemin was succeeded by Michel Molla who made the first flight across Bucharest on September 7, 1910. Molla was succeeded by two others before the school closed in late 1912 due to financial difficulties, having trained six officers, but only licensed two.\n\nIn November 1909, the Romanian Minister of War commissioned Aurel Vlaicu to build the \"A. Vlaicu I\" airplane at the Bucharest Army Arsenal which first flew on June 17, 1910. On September 28, during the Fall military exercise, Vlaicu flew his airplane from Slatina to Piatra Olt carrying a message, Romania thus becoming the second country after France to use airplanes for military purposes. Along with other Romanian pilots, Vlaicu flew reconnaissance missions during the Second Balkan War.\nOn the eve of Romania's entrance in the war in late 1916, the Romanian Air Force comprised only 28 aircraft. The 28 aircraft comprised six different models, namely 10 Bristol T.B.8 biplanes, 7 Bristol Coanda Monoplanes, 4 Farman HF.20 biplanes and 4 Blériot XI. Added to these were two Morane Type F monoplanes and two native-made monoplanes designed by Aurel Vlaicu. One of the Vlaicu monoplanes, A Vlaicu II, crashed in 1913, leaving A Vlaicu I as the sole Romanian-made aircraft in the Romanian Air Force.\nDuring World War I, Romania acquired 322 aircraft from France and ex-RNAS aircraft from Great Britain including Nieuport 11 and 17 single seat fighters and Morane-Saulnier LA and Nieuport 12 two seat fighters.\nCaudron G.3, Henry Farman HF.20, Farman MF.11, and Farman F.40 & 46 artillery observation and reconnaissance aircraft, Caudron G.4, Breguet-Michelin BLM and Voisin LA bombers.\nOn September 16, 1916, a Romanian Farman F.40 downed an Imperial German Air Force aircraft near Slobozia; this was the first Romanian Air Force victory. By the end of World War I, Romanian pilots had flown about 11,000 hours and 750 missions; however, it was unable to prevent the December 1916 Romanian offensive at the Battle of the Arges from being defeated, which resulted in the occupation of Romania, and an armistice on 6 December 1917.\n\nWhen Romania, allied with Nazi Germany, went to war against the USSR on June 22, 1941, the Romanian Air Force had 621 airplanes, including its locally made fighter IAR 80/81. The air force accomplished hundreds of missions, contributing to Romania's recapture of Northern Bucovina and Basarabia, which had been occupied by the Soviet Union a year earlier. Until the Odessa episode, the Romanian military fighters gained 661 air victories. Romanian Military Aviation fought on the Eastern front until August 22, 1944, bringing an important contribution to the great battles in Stalingrad, Crimea, and the Ukrainian fronts.\nBetween 1941–1944, Romanian aircraft won 2,000 air victories. The most famous flying aces were Captain Prince Constantin Cantacuzino, who gained 68 certified victories, Captain Horia Agarici and Captain Alexandru Şerbănescu, who shot down 60 enemy airplanes.\n\nFollowing King Michael's Coup in August 1944, Romania turned against Germany and joined the allies.\n\nStarting with 1948, Romania tailored its military to Soviet concepts and doctrine. On February 15, 1949, the Aviation Command was established based on the Soviet model (regiments instead of flotillas). New Soviet aircraft, such as Yakovlev Yak-18, Polikarpov Po-2, Lavochkin La-9, Tupolev Tu-2, and Ilyushin Il-10 entered service. A year later, 9 Yakovlev Yak-17s and Yak-23s entered the air force, and in 1952, other 88 aircraft: MiG-15 and MiG-17. In 1958, the first supersonic fighter MiG-19 entered the inventory. Three years later, in February 1962, a new fighter was added to the inventory, MiG-21, which represented one of the most effective fighters of that time.\n\nStarting with 1974, Romanian-made aircraft supplemented the already existing jets. The Romanian IAR-93 attack aircraft flew its first flight on 31 October 1974. It represented a great step forward taking into account that it was the only jet fighter not made by the Soviets, the only one ever manufactured and operated by a Warsaw Pact country.\n\nIn 1962, the first helicopter subunits were established and followed later on, in 1965, by the first Soviet Mi-2 and Mi-4 helicopters. Renewing the aircraft fleet process went on, the first 12 MiG-23s entering the service between July–September 1979.\n\nOn 14 May 1981, at 20:16, Soviet spaceship Soyuz-40 was launched from Baikonur to perform a common Romanian-Soviet flight, with Lieutenant Dumitru Prunariu and Colonel Leonid Popov as commander on board. During the early 1980s, 67th Fighter-Bomber Regiment and 49th Fighter-Bomber Regiment from Craiova and Ianca were equipped with new IAR-93s, which replaced old MiG-15s and MiG-17s. In December 1989, just a few days before the Romanian revolution against communism began, MiG-29 aircraft entered the Air Force inventory.\n\nFour MiG-21 LanceR Cs were deployed from August–November 2007 at Šiauliai, in Lithuania for Baltic Air Policing. The Romanian detachment succeeded the French Air Force Mirage 2000Cs of \"Escadron de Chasse 01.012\" from Cambrai, which fulfilled the Baltic Air Policing since May 2007. Once the RoAF finished its three-month stint, a Portuguese Air Force detachment took over the mission.\n\nThe four aircraft and most of the staff came from the 71st Air Base. A total of 67 personnel, among them nine pilots, were part of the detachment: 63 served at Šiauliai, while other four served at the air traffic control centre in Kaunas, to ensure smooth cooperation with local authorities. The Romanian detachment attracted attention from the local media, not least from the fact that it was only the second time a fighter from the Soviet era deployed to Šiauliai - Polish Air Force MiG-29s had also been deployed there in 2006.\n\nThe Romanian Air Force General Staff represents the military concept-developing, command and executive structure providing Air Forces peacetime, crisis and wartime leadership in order to reach, maintain and increase, as required, the operational level of the military subordinated structures so that to be able to operate under authorized commands responsible for military operations planning and conduct.\n\nGenerate, mobilize, structure, equip, operationalize and regenerate the required forces, provide the logistic support necessary to conduct military operations and based on higher orders, take over both the Joint Operation Air Component and independent air operations command and control, through the Main Air Operational Center.\nStarting with July 1, 2010, the Romanian Air Force bases were renamed to Air Flotillas.\n\nThe structure of the Romanian Air Force as of 2018 is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe \"Capu Midia\" Surface-to-air Training and Air-to-Surface Shooting Range provides firing training, execution and evaluation facilities. It is located in Constanţa County, north of the city of, Constanţa.\n\nNote: Three C-17 Globemaster III's are available through the Heavy Airlift Wing based in Hungary.\n\nThe Romanian roundel uses the colours of the Romanian flag. It is used on Romanian Armed Forces vehicles and Romanian Air Force aircraft.\n\n\n"}

Bern, Switzerland, February 13, 1955) is a Swiss flautist and professor of flute who specializes in contemporary music for various sizes of flute (including flute, alto flute, bass flute, and contrabass flute).\n\nZiegler started playing with recorder at the age of four and by the age of nine decided to practice playing a flute. Two years prior to it, his grandparents took him to a flute and organ concert, with the fascination with the flute arose from there. Ziegler plays Miguel Arista's Louis Lot, especially during collaboration with Bickford Brannen and Eva Kingma, who plays Alto flute. His choice of this instrument came after long studying at Zurich Conservatory and eventually making his mind on Jack Moore's flute. In Conservatory he studied under various teachers and music pedagogues, including; William Bennett, Geoffrey Gilbert, André Jaunet, and Conrad Klemm.\n\nZiegler has toured with Andreas Vollenweider and George Gruntz, and performed with Pierre Favre and Mark Dresser. In a classical context, he was formerly the solo flautist for the Zurich Chamber Orchestra.\n\nZiegler's original works for flute instruments feature numerous extended techniques. In order to allow for the production of a buzzing timbre, he has installed small PET film membranes similar to the \"dimo\" used on the Chinese \"dizi\" on several of his instruments; he calls flutes so equipped \"matusiflute.\" In addition, he plays quarter tone flutes.\n\nZiegler is also proficient with jazz and improvised music, and frequently performs in an electroacoustic setting. He amplifies his flutes with microphones installed directly into the instruments, and utilizes electronic loop devices (LOOP delay, Echoplex, Echoloop) to allow him to layer sounds. About his work, he states: \"All sounds (key noise, winds, tongue stops) usually neglected on the flute are amplified. There is a whole orchestra inside the flute, which allows me to play solo-polyphonic music.\" Noting a similarity in tone between his large flutes and the viola da gamba, he also performs Renaissance music originally composed for viola da gamba.\n\nHe lives in Stäfa, Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, and has toured the United States, Japan, Australia, South America, and Israel.\n\n\n"}

He shares a National Basketball Association (NBA) record with Chucky Brown, Joe Smith, and Jim Jackson for having played with twelve different teams over his career.\n\nMassenburg played in college for the University of Maryland from 1986 to 1990, playing under three different head coaches: Lefty Driesell, Bob Wade, and Gary Williams. He had a career field goal shooting percentage of 52.3% and averaged 12.1 points per game in his four-year career with the Terrapins. In his senior season, in which he was featured on the cover of the team's handbook on an aircraft carrier, he averaged 18 points and 10.1 rebounds per game. He was one of only two players in the Atlantic Coast Conference to average double figures in both categories that season. His efforts in his senior season earned him a spot on the All-ACC Second Team.\n\nMassenburg was selected with the 43rd pick in the second round of the 1990 NBA draft by the San Antonio Spurs. During his first stint with the Spurs, he was able to play alongside NBA legend David Robinson. He played in 35 games with the Spurs during the 1990–91 NBA season.\n\nAs part of his first career NBA injury's rehabilitation program, Massenburg went to the Italian League in 1991, where he averaged almost 23 points and 10 rebounds per game in four games with the Italian club Pallacanestro Reggiana.\n\nMassenburg returned to the NBA and his former team the Spurs, however he only played 1 game for the franchise as he was waived on November 2, 1991 in the beginning of the 1991-1992 season.\n\nOn December 11, 1991 Massenburg signed with the Charlotte Hornets where he played for three games before being waived again on January 7, 1992. \n\nOn January 10, 1992 Massenburg signed a 10-day contract with the Boston Celtics for seven games.\n\nOn February 13, 1992 he signed another 10-day contract with the Golden State Warriors for another seven games; ending his season with a total of 18 games and 90 minutes played with four franchises that season.\n\nMassenburg played in the Spanish League with Unicaja-Mayoral for the 1992-1993 season. \n\nHe also played for another Spanish team FC Barcelona during the 1993-94 season.

Massenburg came just short of playing an entire NBA season for the first time in his career during the 1994-95 season for 80 games. Massenburg was taken in the NBA expansion draft in 1995 by the Toronto Raptors. After 24 games there, he was shipped to the Philadelphia 76ers, where he played 30 games.\n\nDuring the 1996-97 season, Massenburg once again came very close to playing an entire NBA season, seeing action in 79 games with yet another team, the New Jersey Nets. Massenburg returned to Canada for the 1997-98 season, playing with the Brian Winters-coached Vancouver Grizzlies. In Vancouver, Massenburg backed up center Bryant Reeves. He played two seasons in Vancouver before being traded before the 1999-2000 season to the Houston Rockets. With the Rockets, he played in ten games, then was promptly returned to the Grizzlies before the 2000-2001 campaign. When the franchise relocated to Memphis in 2001, so did Massenburg. During the Grizzlies' first season on U.S. soil, Massenburg played in 73 games, averaging 5.5 points per game. In successive years, he was a member of the Utah Jazz and the Sacramento Kings.\n\nMassenburg returned to the Spurs for the 2004-05 season and with them he won an NBA championship ring that year, when the Spurs defeated the Detroit Pistons four games to three in the 2005 NBA Finals. During the series Massenburg mainly observed from the bench as his teammates clinched the Spurs' third NBA title in seven years. Unfortunately however, six weeks after the finals ended, a late-night auto accident badly damaged Massenburg's ankle, leaving him unable to play the following two seasons.\n\nAfter being out with the ankle injury for two seasons, Massenburg attempted an NBA comeback in the year 2007 with the Washington Wizards, but he was waived by the team before the season started.

He scored 4,238 points in his career for a career average of 6.2 points per game. He collected 2,964 rebounds in his career for a career average of 4.3 rebounds per game. He also dished out 266 assists in his career, for a career average 0.4 assists per game.\n\nIn 2010 Massenburg started a sports bar in the Kentlands area of Gaithersburg, Maryland with former NBA coach James Lloyd called Tony & James. It was later renamed 44 Sports Bar, which reflected Massenburg's jersey number. The bar closed on June 4, 2012 after 9 months in business.\n\nIn December 2013, Tony Massenburg's jersey number was retired at Sussex Central High School (VA), along with that of Reginald Givens (a former NFL linebacker).

He inherited the Bogner clothing brand, originally set up as \"Willy-Bogner-Skivertrieb\" by his father, Willy Bogner Sr., and expanded through the efforts of his mother, Maria, who is credited with the introduction of stretch pants to the ski fashion world.\n\nBogner was born in Munich, to Wilhelm (Willy Sr.) and Maria Bogner in 1942.\n\nBogner married the Brazilian model, Sônia Ribeiro, a sister of Florinda Bolkan in 1972. The couple adopted two Brazilian children, Florinda and Bernhard. His wife died on May 3, 2017 at the age of 66.\n\nBogner competed for the United Team of Germany shortly after turning 18 at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. He led the competition in the men's slalom after the first run, but fell during the second run. That season, he won the prestigious Lauberhorn downhill at Wengen, Switzerland. In 1962, he became double world student champion in alpine skiing's slalom and alpine combined event.\n\nHis best result in the World Championships was a fourth place in the slalom (and fifth place in the combined) at the 1966 World Championships in August in Portillo, Chile.\n\nBogner was a familiar face in the international ski scene until 1967, when he decided to concentrate his efforts on film-making.\n\nIn April 1964, Bogner was filming scenes of \"Ski Fascination\" (1966), his first production of a ski fashion movie. He led a group of 14 world-class skiers in the Engadine Val Selin in Switzerland, near St. Moritz, below Trais Fluors, where an avalanche occurred, burying several members of the group. The bodies of Bogner's girlfriend Barbi Henneberger and American Buddy Werner were recovered.

Initially acquitted, the prosecution later won a conviction on appeal, of manslaughter by negligence, and Bogner received a two-month suspended sentence.\n\nHe worked as a cameraman in several films requiring complex ski footage. His most notable film work is in the James Bond films from 1969 through 1985, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", \"For Your Eyes Only\" and \"A View to a Kill\" – for which he won the Bambi Award in 1985 and the Bavarian Film Award, Special Prize, in 1986. Playing James Bond in all but the first of these, Roger Moore wears Bogner ski wear, as do many other characters in skiing scenes.\n\nBogner launched his first sports apparel collection, \"Formula W\" in 1971.

It is made of bamboo. Its large reed and cylindrical bore gives it a sound mellower than that of many other types of oboe.\n\nIn the typical piri, there are eight finger holes on the bamboo body. Seven of the finger holes are on the front and one is on the back for the thumb. \n\nThere are four types of \"piri\":\n\nThere are different types of piris because each is suited for a different type of music and use. The Hyang piri is the longest and most common out of all piris. Because of its loud and nasal tone, it usually plays the main melody in an ensemble. The se piri is the smaller, thinner, and much quieter one. Additionally, because of its quiet tone, it is used along with voices or soft stringed instruments. The Dang/Tang piri is wider and is similar to the Chinese guanzi instrument. Additionally, the dae piri is a modernized piri, with keys and a bell, looking much more like a western oboe. \n\nPiri is thought to have been introduced to Korea from a country bordering west of China before Goguryeo period. According to the \"Book of Sui\", piri was also known as \"gagwan\" (가관; 笳管), and it originates from Kucha. During the reign of King Yejong of Goryeo dynasty, another double-reed cylindrical instrument was imported from Song dynasty China, and to disambiguate, the former was named \"hyang piri\" and the latter \"dang piri\". \"Se piri\" is smaller than \"hyang piri\" but has the same structure and range. \"Se piri\" appears to be invented much later than \"hyang piri\".\n\nThe piri's equivalent in China is the \"guan\" (also known as \"bili\"), and its counterpart in Japan is the \"hichiriki\".\n\n"}

A one-club man, Labone's professional career lasted from 1958 to 1971, during which he won the Football League championship twice and the FA Cup once. He also played 26 times for the England national football team.\n\nBrian Labone was born in Liverpool, England, on 23 January 1940. His parents were Arthur Leslie Labone and Bridget Patricia Rice. The Labone family have distant Italian roots through an ancestor called Nicholas Antonio Labone who taught various foreign languages in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nLabone attended the Liverpool Collegiate School.\n\nLiverpool-born Labone chose to join Everton at 17 in July 1957 instead of going to university. His debut for the first team was in 1958. He was widely regarded as one of the best central defenders of his era. He was a strong tackler, good in the air, adequately fast but he rarely used his left foot.\n\nLabone made 451 League appearances for Everton and a total of 534 in all competitions. He scored two league goals and was booked only twice throughout his career. Manager Harry Catterick called him \"\"the last of the Corinthians\"\". Labone played in the championship teams of 1962–63 and 1969–70, in the FA Cup winning team of 1966, and in the FA Cup final of 1968. He also won the FA Charity Shield in 1963 and 1970. Labone showed his high opinion of Everton in a simple quote \"\"One Evertonian is worth twenty Liverpudlians\"\"\n\nLabone played 26 times for England between 1962 and 1970. He withdrew from England's 1966 World Cup squad because of his imminent marriage but played in three of the four games in the World Cup in 1970 in Mexico.\n\nIn 1970–71 Labone sustained a serious injury to his Achilles tendon and retired from playing. A few years earlier he had announced, at the beginning of the season, his intention to retire at the end of that season, in typical fashion giving the club as much notice as possible so that he could be replaced. Such was the outcry however that he changed his mind and played on for two more seasons.\n\nLabone maintained his links with Everton where he worked as a guide for guests & visitors and a website columnist. Labone was included in Everton's 'Greatest Ever Team' \nas voted for by the fans at the start of the 2003/04 season to mark the club's 125th anniversary.\n\nWhilst returning home from an Everton fans awards evening at the Winslow Hotel in Walton, Labone died suddenly after collapsing in the street close to his Lydiate home at the age of 66. He was survived by Pat, his wife of 40 years, and daughter Rachelle (born 1970).\n\nAnother former Everton captain, Kevin Ratcliffe, paid the following tribute: \"\"Brian was Everton. If you could put together a team of every player that has ever captained Everton, every one of us would turn to Brian to lead us out. He will always be known as the captain of Everton\"\". Everton Chairman Bill Kenwright also paid tribute by saying: \"\"On the foot of the Dixie Dean statue outside Goodison Park are the words 'Footballer, Gentleman, Evertonian'. Those words summed up Dixie and they apply, equally, to the great Brian Labone.\"\" Part of Everton's home ground, Goodison Park, was named in his honour.\n\n"}

Where the ship is hypothecated, the bond is called a bottomry bond. Where both the ship and its cargo are hypothecated, the relationship is called respondentia. Due to the bottomry bond's relatively low priority as against other liens in the event of a libel against the ship, the use of bottomry bonds declined greatly in the 19th century and the subject is today of interest only to legal historians.\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi describes a form of bottomry which is a risk transferring technique. A bottomry would be taken, but the repayment would be contingent on the ship successfully completing the voyage. This is more like a catastrophe bond than traditional insurance. In traditional insurance, you pay premiums and receive a benefit on the risk event. With bottomry and catastrophe bonds, you receive a loan up front and only pay it back with a premium if the risk event doesn't occur.\n\nIn his \"Life of Cato the Elder\", Plutarch describes how he would use the process to make money, but calls it \"the most disreputable form of money-lending.\" Kaplan and Kaplan describe it as follows:\n\nRespondentia is a loan where a ship's cargo is the security, on similar terms to bottomry.\n\n\n"}

All four, Kristen Breitweiser, Patty Casazza, Lorie Van Auken, and Mindy Kleinberg, were residents of New Jersey, and helped lobby the U.S. government to carry out an investigation into the terrorist attacks, resulting in the formation of the 9/11 Commission and the subsequent report released by the Commission.\n\nSurvivors and family members of the victims were the most vocal and persistent in the call for the creation of an independent commission to investigate the 9/11 attacks. The leaders of several 9/11 family groups began to work together to lobby political leaders. The Jersey Girls were part of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee, whose members were instrumental in the creation of the 9/11 Commission and in pressing the commission to oversee a thorough and credible investigation. According to Matthew Purdy of \"The New York Times\": \"The commission grew largely out of pressure from families of victims, including four New Jersey widows who call themselves 'the Jersey Girls.' It's no mistake that the White House put New Jersey's most popular politician (Tom Kean) in charge.\"\n\nKean became the Commission's Chairman after Henry Kissinger resigned the position; according to Peter Lance, \"The Jersey Girls could take some of the credit for his hasty departure.\" Van Auken told Lance:\n\nWe were shocked. Kissinger had huge conflicts of interest -- major dealings with the Saudis ... The day before he resigned, we had a meeting with him in his office in Manhattan. Kristen [Breitweiser] had done impeccable research. She'd looked up all of his companies. So I asked him, 'Mr. Kissinger, do you have any Saudi clients?' He mumbled something. And then he asked if someone would pour him some coffee. So then I said, 'Do you happen to have any clients by the name of \"bin Laden?\" He almost fell off the couch.\n\nA few months before the Commission released its report, Kean said that the Jersey Girls \"call me all the time. They monitor us, they follow our progress, they've provided us with some of the best questions we've asked. I doubt very much if we would be in existence without them.\"\n\nThe eventual appointment of Philip D. Zelikow to the position of Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission was also troubling to the Jersey Girls who demanded his resignation. They cited close personal ties with the Bush family and the National Security Advisor as conflicts of interest. Mindy Kleinberg said, \"As executive director, he has pretty much the most important job on the commission. He hires the staff, he sets the direction and focus, he chooses witnesses at the hearings.\" Joe Conason wrote that the widows \"fear that even with the best of intentions, Zelikow's connections to the Bush White House will 'taint the validity' of the commission's final report. Their demand that he resign or be fired has been rejected by the commission's co-chairmen, former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and former Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton. 'We respectfully disagree with them,' replied Al Felzenberg, the commission's press spokesman, who said Zelikow was chosen 'for his scholarly credentials and his knowledge of national security issues.' He hastened to praise the widows for doing 'a very positive thing,' adding that while he understood their concerns, he expected that \"they're not going to be satisfied with everything we do.\"\n\nAs part of the 9/11 Family Steering Committee they helped form, the Jersey Girls monitored and often criticized the 9/11 Commission after they lobbied successfully for its creation. The Jersey Girls pressured the U.S. government for months to have National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice testify in front of the Commission; when she refused to testify under oath in March 2004, \"they walked out in silent protest.\" The White House, in a \"dramatic about-face,\" gave in and Rice testified.\n\nWhen it became clear to them that the Commission had omitted crucial information from its report, the widows called for a new independent panel. \"I'm very disturbed, and I want to get some answers,\" said Breitweiser. \"I want to know what the truth is.\" She called the 2004 findings \"an utterly hollow report.\"\n\nThe Jersey Widows testified before a hearing chaired by Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney on July 22, 2005\n\nThe Jersey Girls have been the target of attacks at various times. In 2004, Frank Rich wrote in the \"New York Times\":\n\nThe phenomenon has sufficiently alarmed the White House that earlier in the month its media allies tried to discredit the 9/11 families, particularly the so-called 'Jersey Girls,' the four telegenic suburban widows who have forced the administration to reverse its stonewalling of the 9/11 commission at nearly every juncture. Rush Limbaugh labeled Kristen Breitweiser a Democratic operative. Bill O'Reilly sounded the alarm that 'some 9/11 families have aligned themselves with the far left.' But this stab at damage control went nowhere.\n\nIn her book \"\" (2006), conservative commentator Ann Coulter created a firestorm of controversy with her remarks about the Jersey Girls. Coulter wrote:\n\nThey first came together to complain that the $1.6 million average settlement to be paid to 9/11 victims' families by the government was not large enough ... These broads are millionaires, lionized on TV and in articles about them, reveling in their status as celebrities ... These self-obsessed women seemed genuinely unaware that 9/11 was an attack on our nation and acted as if the terrorist attacks happened only to them. ... I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much ... the Democrat ratpack gals endorsed John Kerry for president ... cutting campaign commercials ... how do we know their husbands weren't planning to divorce these harpies? Now that their shelf life is dwindling, they'd better hurry up and appear in \"Playboy\".\n\nThese statements received national attention after an interview on \"The Today Show\", and were widely criticized. The Jersey Girls themselves also responded critically to Coulter's remarks. Kristen Breitweiser stated: \"I'd like her to meet my daughter and tell her how anyone could enjoy their father's death ... She sounds like a very disturbed, unraveled person.\" Lorie Van Auken said she \"was stunned by the vitriol\"; and \"Having my husband burn alive in a building brought me no joy. Watching it unfold on national TV and seeing it repeated endlessly was beyond what I could describe. Telling my children they would never see their father again was not fun. And we had no plans to divorce.\"\n\nNevertheless, Coulter has repeated her criticism of the Jersey Girls.\n\nI feel sorry for all the widows of 9/11 ... [but] I do not believe that sanctifies their political message. ... They have attacked Bush, they have attacked Condoleezza Rice, they're cutting campaign commercials for Kerry. But we can't respond because their husbands died ... I think it's one of the ugliest things the left has done ... this idea that you need some sort of personal authenticity in order to make a political point ...\n\nThe \"New York Daily News\" reported that the Jersey Girls \"tried to stay above the name-calling fray\" by emphasizing that\n\nthe nation shouldn't focus on Coulter's words but on security problems like porous borders, wasteful Homeland Security funding and intelligence agencies that don't work together. 'Our only motivation ever was to make our nation safer,' they said in a statement. 'We have been slandered. Contrary to Ms. Coulter's statements, there was no joy in watching men that we loved burn alive. There was no happiness in telling our children that their fathers were never coming home again. We adored these men and miss them every day.'\nAnd Senator Hillary Clinton found it \"unimaginable that anyone in the public eye could launch a vicious, mean-spirited attack on people whom I've known over the last four and a half years to be concerned deeply about the safety and security of our country.\"\n\nAfter the 9/11 Commission issued its report, the Jersey Girls pressured the Administration to follow its recommendations. They specifically commended the Commission for not politicizing blame in the report. \"The \"USS Cole\" was bombed under Clinton's watch, and 9/11 happened under Bush's watch,\" said Rosemary Dillard. \"I don't blame either administration; I blame the people who were reporting to them.\" As the 2004 election neared, the widows criticized Bush for the failure to enact the recommendations of the commission; many interpreted this as an endorsement of Bush's opponent John Kerry; the \"New York Times\" reported, \"In a statement clearly meant to influence voters in next week's election, the group did not explicitly endorse Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, but said Mr. Bush had 'allowed members of his own party to derail the legislative process.'\" There were other 9/11 victims' families who supported the Bush campaign. For example, Debra Burlingame, whose brother flew in the plane that was crashed into the Pentagon, responded to the widows: \"The Jersey Girls criticized President Bush because he wasn't rounding up Arabs in airport lounges before Sept. 11. These are the same people who are now decrying the use of the Patriot Act.\"\n\nThe Jersey Widows were interviewed on the television series \"NOW on PBS\" and in the documentary film \"\" (2006).\n\nKristen Breitweiser won the Ron Ridenhour Prize for \"truth-telling\", in 2005, for her work with the Jersey Girls.\n\n\n"}

Following the open rift between the two, Tuđman in Spring of 1994 tried to replace Manolić from the position of House of Chambers speaker. Manolić, however, preempted this by talking a number of HDZ representatives to support him together with opposition. Soon, he was joined by House of Representatives speaker Stjepan Mesić and two of them announced split from HDZ and formation of new party. They accused Tuđman of embracing authoritarianism, extreme nationalism and irredentist policies towards Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was, in their mind, betrayal of founding principles of HDZ. From that point onward, HND tried to describe itself as a \"genuine\" HDZ.\n\nFor a while, it looked that HDZ would ultimately lose parliamentary majority, but Tuđman in the end managed to keep number of its moderates in line, thus maintaining and later solidifying his grip on power. HND nevertheless managed to replace HDZ governments on local levels, most notably in Zagreb County, an event that would eventually lead to Zagreb Crisis.\n\nIn 1995 parliamentary elections, it became apparent that HND didn't attract many of HDZ voters, while those already opposed to Tuđman overwhelmingly preferred older opposition parties.

Dummer passed the first radar trainers and became a pioneer of reliability engineering at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern in the 1940s.\n\nBorn in Hull, Dummer studied electrical engineering at Manchester College of Technology starting in the early 1930s. By the early 1940s he was working at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern (later to become the Royal Radar Establishment).\n\nHis work with colleagues at TRE led him to the belief that it would be possible to fabricate multiple circuit elements on and into a substance like silicon. In 1952 he became one of the first people to speak publicly on the topic of integrated circuits, presenting his conceptual work at a conference in Washington, DC. As a result, he has been called \"the prophet of the integrated circuit\" .\n\nDummer was admitted to a nursing home in Malvern in 2000 due to a stroke and died in September 2002, aged 93.\n\nG. W. A. Dummer was born in Hull, Yorkshire, England, 25 February 1909, and educated at Sale High School and Manchester College of Technology. His first job was with Mullard Radio Valve Company in 1931 examining defective valves returned by customers to establish the cause of failure, the company's aim being to attribute the cause to rough handling to avoid having to supply free replacements. Technicians were expected to process up to 1000 valves per day.\n\nIn 1935 he moved to A. C. Cossor Ltd to work on cathode ray tubes, time bases and circuits. In 1938 he moved to Salford Electrical Instruments and worked in the high-frequency laboratories. The following year he joined the Ministry of Defence as a Technical Officer on a salary of £275 pa and worked with the team under R. J. Dippy on time bases at the Air Ministry Research Establishment (later known as the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), The Royal Radar Establishment (RRE), Malvern and the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment). The group was responsible for the first plan position indicator (PPI) ever built, and they were granted two patents for their work.\n\nThe pace of development increased dramatically during the early war years for the personnel of RRE, Malvern, and a close working relationship was established with the Royal Air Force. In 1942 Geoffrey Dummer started a Synthetic Trainer Design Group and was responsible for the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of over 70 types of radar training equipment for service use during the war. In 1943 he visited the United States and Canada to advise on trainers and to help set up similar training devices in the USA.\n\nIn 1944 he had been made Divisional Leader of the Physical & Tropical Testing Laboratories and the Component Group, which placed contracts with industry for new components and materials. His interest in components grew out of his experience with radar. \"They were the bricks and mortar, and many of them were not as reliable as they should have been\", he said. Out of his drive for reliability came the search for new techniques and methods of construction. Together with Dr A. C. Vivian he made the first plastic potted circuit in January 1947 to protect components from shock and moisture. Printed wiring methods and etching techniques were explored, and their use encouraged in radar equipment.\n\nIn May 1952 Geoffrey Dummer read a paper at the US Electronic Components Symposium. At the end of the paper he made the statement: \"With the advent of the transistor and the work on semi-conductors generally, it now seems possible to envisage electronic equipment in a solid block with no connecting wires. The block may consist of layers of insulating, conducting, rectifying and amplifying materials, the electronic functions being connected directly by cutting out areas of the various layers\".\n\nThis is now generally accepted as the first public description of an integrated circuit. At a later date he said:\n\nIt seemed so logical to me; we had been working on smaller and smaller components, improving reliability as well as size reduction. I thought the only way we could ever attain our aim was in the form of a solid block. You then do away with all your contact problems, and you have a small circuit with high reliability. And that is why I went on with it. I shook the industry to the bone. I was trying to make them realise how important its invention would be for the future of microelectronics and the national economy.\nHis ability to turn his idea of an integrated circuit into practical reality was restricted by his lack of responsibility for active devices and the lack of suitable manufacturing techniques. He got over his lack of suitable authority to commission development work by placing a small contract with Plessey under the auspices of his Constructional Techniques Group. The result was shown at The International Components Symposium he initiated at R.R.E. Malvern in September 1957, where he presented a model to illustrate the possibilities of solid-circuit techniques. The model represented a flip-flop in the form of a solid block of semiconductor material suitably doped and shaped to form four transistors. Four resistors were represented by silicon bridges, and other resistors and capacitors were deposited in film form directly onto the silicon block with intervening insulating films. The model was intended as a design exercise, but was not too different from the circuit patented by Jack St Clair Kilby two years later.\n\nDummer made no claim to be the inventor of microelectronics, a role he assigned to Robert Noyce and Jean Hoerni, whose planar process turned the relatively crude ideas of Kilby into a reliable manufacturing product, which is what Dummer had been waiting for. He began a campaign to encourage substantial UK investment in IC development, but was met largely with apathy. The UK military failed to perceive any operational requirements for ICs, and UK companies were unwilling to invest their own money. He later said: \"I have attributed it to war-weariness in one of my books, but that is perhaps an excuse. The plain fact is that nobody would take the risk. The Ministry wouldn't place a contract because they hadn't an application. The applications people wouldn't say we want it because they had no experience with it. It was a chicken-and-egg situation. The Americans took financial gambles, whereas this was very slow in this country\". It was years before the UK had a significant semiconductor industry.\n\nHis knowledge and experience of components, their design, construction, application, and reliability had become widely recognised. He liaised with numerous international organisations and authorities. He served on many committees worldwide, both as member and chairman. He appeared on the popular BBC Television programme \"Tomorrow's World\", extolling the virtues of integrated circuits. In 1964 he sponsored a symposium on Electronic Beam Techniques for Microelectronics at R.R.E. He produced numerous books on electronic equipment, inventions and discoveries, components and reliability, for several publishing houses, including McGraw-Hill, Pitman and notably, Pergamon Press, whose Electronic Data Series ran to 39 volumes. His retirement as Superintendent of Applied Physics in 1966 allowed him to take up the role of a consultant, as well as continuing to add to his numerous published works. He was Editor-in-Chief of Pergamon's International Journal \"Microelectronics and Reliability\", which he had founded, and Editorial Adviser to Electronic Components (United Trade Press).\n\nHis wife Dorothy died in 1992, and he married again, to June, who survived him. As a result of a stroke in 1999, he spent his last two and a half years at Perrins House, Malvern. He died in September 2002 and was interred in Malvern Cemetery.\n\nGeoffrey William Arnold Dummer was born 25 February 1909 at Kingston upon Hull, England, the son of Arthur Robert William Dummer, a caretaker, and Daisy Maria King. Geoffrey married Dorothy Whitelegg in 1934, the marriage being registered at Bucklow. Their only son, Stephen John, was born in 1945 at Bearsted, Kent.\n\nIn May 1966 Geoffrey was contacted by Michael Dummer, who had started a study of all Dummers, concerning Geoffrey's family history. At that time Geoffrey knew almost nothing of his ancestors before his grandparents, but was stimulated to start researching them. He was particularly hopeful of establishing a link with the notable Dummer family who had held estates in Hampshire in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, and who included in their number Edmund Dummer, Surveyor of The Navy, and Richard Dummer, one of the founding fathers of Massachusetts.\n\nHis researches were to lead him in a different direction, however. His father had been born at the City Gaol, Gorton, where his grandfather, Moses Dummer, was gaoler. Geoffrey found out that Moses was born in the village of Lacock, Wiltshire. A search through the parish registers at Lacock revealed a long line of Dummers stretching back to 1559, and although it was not possible to positively prove his own line beyond Robert Dummer of 1732, it was obvious that his roots stretched a long way back at Lacock. The names Moses, Robert and Ephraim were a recurrent feature. Like others at Lacock, many of the family had been weavers, and the little packhorse bridge near the church had at one time been known as Dummer's Bridge. Sadly, Geoffrey's only son, Stephen, a Merchant Navy officer, was drowned in Mombasa in 1983, terminating Geoffrey's interest in family history, and he passed his papers to Michael Dummer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2106669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106669", "title": "Mega Man X (video game)", "text": "Mega Man X (video game)\n\nMega Man X is an action-platform video game developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was the first \"Mega Man\" game for the 16-bit console and the first game in the \"Mega Man X\" series, a spin-off of the original \"Mega Man\" series that began on the SNES's predecessor, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). \"Mega Man X\" was released in Japan on December 17, 1993 and was released in both North America and Europe the following year. Taking place a century after the original \"Mega Man\" series, \"Mega Man X\" is set in a futuristic world populated by both humans and \"Reploids\", robots capable of thinking, feeling, and growing like their human creators. Because of these complex attributes, many Reploids are prone to destructive, renegade activity and are thereafter referred to as \"Mavericks\". The plot of the game follows the protagonist Mega Man X, an android member of a military task force called the \"Maverick Hunters\". With the help of his partner Zero, X must thwart the plans of Sigma, a powerful Maverick leader wishing to bring about human extinction.\n\nWith the transition to more advanced gaming hardware, series artist Keiji Inafune explained that the development of \"Mega Man X\" involved reinventing \"Mega Man\" through gameplay expansion and a more mature storyline while still maintaining the basic concepts on which the franchise was built. Much like the NES \"Mega Man\" games that came before it, \"Mega Man X\" is a standard action-platform game where the player takes control of the eponymous character and must complete a set of eight, initial stages in any order desired. Defeating the boss character at the end of each stage grants the player one new weapon that can then be toggled and used at will for the remainder of the game. However, \"Mega Man X\" adds a number of new features and makes radical changes to the original gameplay mechanics of previous releases in the series. These include allowing the player to dash along the ground, scale walls, and obtain armor attachments which grant special abilities.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" has met with positive reviews for its gameplay, sound, and graphics, as well as its attempt to augment the aging \"Mega Man\" franchise. A longterm commercial success on the SNES, \"Mega Man X\" has since been ported to personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices, included in the North American \"Mega Man X Collection\" for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2), and released on the Virtual Console download service for the Wii, the Wii U, and the New Nintendo 3DS. The game also received a remake on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) titled Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X. Nintendo re-released \"Mega Man X\" in September 2017 as part of the company's Super NES Classic Edition, and a limited physical re-release for the SNES in celebration of \"Mega Man\"'s 30th Anniversary due for release in September 2018 and published by iam8bit.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" takes place in an unspecified time during the 22nd century (21XX) and approximately 100 years after the original \"Mega Man\" series. A human archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers the ruins of a robotics research facility that had once been operated by the legendary robot designer Dr. Thomas Light. Among the ruins, Cain finds a large capsule which contains a highly advanced robot with human-level intelligence and emotions, and even free will, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Light had wished to instill within his creation reasonable sanity, good nature, and an understanding of the more controversial aspects of human morality. The robot was buried while running a 30-year diagnostic program to ensure these features. Cain spends the next several months studying the robot, who is named Mega Man X, or simply \"X\". Cain decides to duplicate X and, within several months, completes the first \"replicate android\" or \"Reploid\", a robot who can think, feel, learn, and grow exactly like a human. Within the year, the design is standardized and Reploids are mass-produced. However, with the free will given to a Reploid comes the possibility of criminal activity; such rogue Reploids are branded as \"Mavericks\" by law-abiding citizens.\n\nAs the public outcry against the few Maverick incidents becomes too great to deny, the government steps in, and under the advice of Dr. Cain, forms an elite military police organization called the \"Maverick Hunters\". The Hunters are to capture or disable any Reploids that pose a threat to humans, provide damage control at Maverick uprisings, help with disaster recovery, and perform other tasks as needed. To lead this group, Cain designs a very advanced Reploid, thought to be immune to whatever defect causes Mavericks. This robot, named Sigma, heads the Hunters for some time before ultimately becoming a Maverick himself, alongside the vast majority of the other Hunters. Sigma seizes control of a small island, driving out all human occupants. Claiming that the humans are inferior and that they are limiting the growth and potential of Reploids, he calls for his followers to begin a massive extinction effort. X, guilt-ridden at having helped design such a dangerous race, joins forces with the only other remaining Hunter, Zero, in order to stop Sigma at any cost.\n\nWhile on a mission involving a Maverick attack on a highway, X encounters Vile, a mercenary Maverick working for Sigma who pilots a mechanized tank called \"Ride Armor\". Unable to defeat Vile, X is saved at a critical moment by Zero, forcing Vile to retreat. Zero then offers encouragement to the less combat-savvy X after the battle. X proceeds to track down and exterminate eight of Sigma's most powerful Mavericks, then rendezvous with Zero outside Sigma's stronghold. Inside the compound, X finds that Zero has been captured by Vile. Another battle ensues, ending similar to their first meeting with X at Vile's mercy. Zero suddenly breaks free of his restraints, latches onto Vile, and self-detonates, destroying his own body and the Maverick's Ride Armor. Shocked over Zero's sacrifice, X regains his strength and finishes off Vile. Zero encourages his comrade once again, and succumbs to his damage. Now more determined than ever, X fights his way to Sigma, destroys the Maverick leader, and escapes the island fortress as it explodes and sinks. As he returns to base, X reflects on the events that have unfolded, questioning Zero's sacrifice, his own decision to fight, and the ongoing war with the Mavericks. After the credits, a message from Sigma reveals that X merely destroyed a temporary body, and that Sigma's spirit lives on. Sigma then says that he would gather new, stronger bodies to do his bidding, and he would see X soon.\n\nThe original \"Mega Man\" series on the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. \"Mega Man X\" uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters. Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Defeating a Maverick allows X to use that Maverick's signature weapon. The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; the password will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage. In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armors to fight enemies. Ride Armors are bipedal tanks capable of powerful punches.\n\nX's abilities are similar to those in previous \"Mega Man\" games, such as running, jumping, and a chargeable arm cannon named the \"X-Buster\". However, \"Mega Man X\" introduces a number of elements not present in the original \"Mega Man\" titles. One prominent feature is the ability to scale, slide down, or jump off nearly any wall. Armor part capsules can be found in several stages which display a holographic message from Dr. Light when approached. Each capsule upgrades one of X's body parts—his legs, armor, helmet, or X-Buster—granting the player improved firepower and defense, as well as new abilities, like a dash upgrade. The player can also collect hidden \"Heart Tanks\" that extend X's maximum life energy and \"Sub-Tanks\" that can store extra energy for later use. When certain conditions are met, a secret capsule can be unlocked which gives X the ability to perform the \"Hadouken\", an attack used by characters from Capcom's \"Street Fighter\" series.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" was developed by a team at Capcom which had worked on the long-running \"Mega Man\" series for the NES. Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as a planner as Inemuryar) recounted that the development of \"Mega Man X\" required a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to branch out from original \"Mega Man\" games while still maintaining their fundamentals. In the original \"Mega Man\" series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for \"Mega Man X\". Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that \"Mega Man\" had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.\n\nInafune created the character Zero, whom he originally intended to be the game's main, playable protagonist. \"When the \"X\" series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man,\" Inafune explained. \"I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t want to use the same old Mega Man.\" Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. The development team additionally wanted the world of \"Mega Man X\" to be much more sophisticated than in the first \"Mega Man\" series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's \"hardcore\" personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had \"a side to him you couldn't really hate\". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an \"unforeseen error\" that leads him to be completely evil. The game's story went through several changes during development. Two allies of Mega Man X, named RX and RY, appeared in previews for the game, but were later taken out. \"Mega Man X\" altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a \"Man\" moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic animal-like androids. The art and pixelization for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle and Chill Penguin; Kaji did Spark Mandrill, Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring. Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting the rest of the team by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies. \n\nThe musical score for \"Mega Man X\" was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for \"Mega Man X2\" and \"X4\" respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994. Music using the SNES instrumentals was included as part of the \"Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6\" soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.\n\nThe success of the \"Mega Man\" series allowed Capcom to continue releasing NES titles well into the 16-bit era. A teaser for an SNES incarnation of the \"Mega Man\" series first made its way into a preview of \"Mega Man 6\" in the spring 1993 issue of the Japanese \"Club Capcom\" fan magazine. \"Mega Man X\" was announced in North America in a March 1993 \"Game Players\" magazine interview with Capcom's Senior Vice President Joseph Morici. The tentatively titled \"Super Mega Man\" was originally to have a \"fairly large memory configuration and a battery backup\". The autumn 1993 issue of \"Club Capcom\" announced \"Rockman X\" for a December 1993 release in Japan, divulged several plot and gameplay details, and showed Zero as a silhouetted \"Blues-like character\". Leading up to its release, the game was covered by the North American press surrounding the summer 1993 and winter 1994 Consumer Electronics Shows.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" has been widely acclaimed by critics since its release. Gaming magazines in the United States and Europe including \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (\"EGM\"), \"GamePro\", \"Game Players\", \"Nintendo Power\", \"Super Play\", and the German version of \"Total!\" consistently lauded the game's visuals, audio, control, and overall gameplay. \"Game Players\" summarized \"Mega Man X\" as \"a near-perfect cart with classic gameplay, excellent graphics and sound and tons of hidden items and power-ups\". \"Nintendo Power\" stated that the game had \"great control and fun\" along with \"challenging play\".\n\nWebsites such as IGN, GameSpot, GamesRadar, and 1UP.com retrospectively held \"Mega Man X\" as a successful milestone in transitioning the \"Mega Man\" series from its increasingly stale existence on the NES to the SNES. Brett Elston of GamesRadar stated, \"\"X\" was a total reinvention of the series, a perfectly executed update that had fans anticipating its release with a fervor the franchise hadn't seen since the \"Mega Man 2\" and \"3\" days.\"\n\n\"Mega Man X\" received criticism from some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the \"EGM\" review panel all noted that the game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. \"Super Play\" editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. \"A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits,\" Nicholson explained. \"Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit to put pressure on your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player.\" \"Nintendo Power\" criticized how little the game had changed stating that \"the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles.\"\n\nThe game's title initially proved a source of some confusion; the gaming media reported that many gamers mistook the \"X\" for the roman numeral 10.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" was ranked number 58 in \"Nintendo Power\"'s \"100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time\" in its 100th issue in September 1997, number 103 in the publication's \"Top 200 Games\" list for its 200th issue in February 2006, and the 11th best SNES game of all time in its August 2008 issue. Both GamesRadar and ScrewAttack listed \"Mega Man X\" as the eighth best game in the SNES library. \"GamePro\" similarly listed it as the eighth greatest 16-bit video game. \"Game Informer\" considered it the 120th best game of all time in its own 200th issue in December 2009. IGN named it the twelfth-best on its own top 100 SNES games list in 2011.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" was a commercial success. The SNES version has sold 1.16 million copies worldwide to date, making it the 41st best-selling Capcom game of all time. IGN's Jeremy Dunham speculated that the game's more mature storyline and its inclusion of numerous gameplay extensions over the original \"Mega Man\" series helped create a \"unique cadre of fans\". The game was followed by seven direct sequels and three related titles: \"Mega Man Xtreme\", \"Mega Man Xtreme 2\", and \"Mega Man X Command Mission\". Another video game spin-off series, \"Mega Man Zero\", began in 2002 on the Game Boy Advance handheld as a result of the immense popularity of the character Zero.\n\nAfter the SNES version debuted, \"Mega Man X\" was ported by Rozner Labs to the IBM PC in 1995 and was packaged with a six-button game controller. \"Mega Man X\" received a separate PC release in Japan in 1996. Majesco Entertainment republished the SNES version of the game in 1997. Nintendo also republished the game in Japan on its Nintendo Power cartridge service in 1998. \"Mega Man X\", alongside its next five direct sequels and \"\", was compiled and made available on the \"Mega Man X Collection\" in North America for the Nintendo GameCube and PS2 in 2006. \nAn enhanced remake titled \"Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X\", or in Japan, was released worldwide for the PSP between 2005 and 2008. With the launch of the PSP, Keiji Inafune and his team debated on whether or not to create a \"Mega Man X9\". \"So, we decided that instead of going the \"X9\" route, let's go back to the series' roots and rediscover what makes the \"X\" series so classic,\" Inafune concluded. \"We felt that the best way to do that would be to make an \"X\" remake.\" Although the remake stays true to the original game in both gameplay and basic storyline, \"Maverick Hunter X\" features a total graphical overhaul with 3D character models and backgrounds, a remixed soundtrack, voice acting, and anime cutscenes. According to Yoshikawa, the character illustrations were updated to resemble both toys and the designs of \"Mega Man X8\".\n\nIn addition to these changes, many power-ups in \"Maverick Hunter X\", such as the armor capsules, are relocated to different levels. The remake also has a few extras including an original video animation titled \"The Day of Sigma\" (which serves as a storyline prequel) and an unlockable mode to play through the game as the character Vile. Inafune implemented this mode to offer players a new perspective on the game through the eyes of a villain, feeling it would be \"too obvious and boring\" given an option to play as Zero.\n\nLike the original game, \"Maverick Hunter X\" has received very positive reviews from critics, accumulating aggregate scores of 82% on GameRankings and 79 out of 100 on Metacritic. Although the game did not meet sales expectations, it was later made available as a download from the PlayStation Network. The Japanese and North American versions were also bundled in a special compilation with \"\", a remake of the original \"Mega Man\".\n\nCapcom released a port of \"Mega Man X\" onto FOMA and i-mode compatible mobile phones in Japan in 2007. \"Mega Man X\" has also been made available for purchase on the Virtual Console service in Japan and North America in 2011 for the Wii, and later in Europe in 2012, as well as for the Wii U in 2013 and the New Nintendo 3DS in 2016. The game was ported to the Android operating system in Japan as a free download on November 18, 2011. Another remake of \"Mega Man X\" was released on the Apple iOS (iPhone and iPod Touch) on December 21, 2011. This version is based on the mobile phone version of the game and features touch controls, Game Center support, and a challenge mode with 80 levels. However, this version removed extra life power-ups, and separated the levels into chunks by black screen transitions, as opposed to the continuous scrolling of the original. Weapon and armor upgrades could also be purchased with actual money to ease the game's difficulty.\n\n\"Mega Man X\" was announced for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch as part of \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection\" (\"Rockman X Anniversary Collection\" in Japan) which was released on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan and also possesses an optional high-resolution filter to create higher-resolution graphics for this game. In addition, the Day of Sigma OVA from \"Maverick Hunter X\" is available as part of this release, which is also available on \"Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2\" as well.\n\nA limited physical cartridge re-release was announced in May 2018 published by iam8bit in celebration of \"Mega Man\"'s 30th Anniversary. The release will be limited to 8,500 copies, with 7,500 produced in opaque light blue cartridges 1,000 in glow-in-the-dark translucent blue, with each color in a random box. The game's instruction booklet will include a foreword by Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil and packaging restoration by Jango Snow Art & Design.\n\n"}

The realignment of Circuit Link and Ubi Avenue 2 began on 15 January 2004.\n\nProvisions were made for the east-west platforms built along the station which also accelerated the construction of Downtown Line Stage 3 on 20 August 2010.\n\nThe station was opened on 17 April 2010 along with the rest of Stage 1 & 2 of the Circle line. The original platforms are in Basement 2.\n\nThe Downtown line portion of this station opened on 21 October 2017, as announced by the Land Transport Authority on 31 May that year, the extended platforms are in Basement 4.

He started his career with Blackburn Rovers and first played a League game in the 1960–61 season. Newton went on to play over 300 games for the club.\n\nIn defensive mode, the tall, sparely built Mancunian was a study in quiet efficiency, an expert tackler, effective in the air and adept at intelligent interceptions, but it was his capacity for attack which illustrated his quality most vividly. At his peak he was renowned as a raiding overlapper, virtually doubling as a winger at a time when those entertaining worthies were sadly out of fashion, and no one deployed him more effectively than the England manager Sir Alf Ramsey.\n\nHe transferred to Everton in December 1969 and made 12 appearances for them in the latter half of the 1969–70 season, in which Everton won the Football League First Division. He also won the 1970 FA Charity Shield.\n\nNewton moved to Burnley for the 1972–73 season, making his league debut on 12 August 1972 against Carlisle United. He made a total of 209 league appearances for Burnley, his last coming in the 1977–78 season. Following this, he appeared for Clitheroe and Morecambe in non-league football.\n\nNewton made his international debut for England against West Germany in February 1966, and after being named in the provisional squad for that summer's World Cup, he ultimately ended up on the stand by list and missed out on England's victory. He went on to play 27 times for England, including three games at the 1970 World Cup Finals, where, through injury, he gained the distinction of becoming the first England player to be substituted at a World Cup, being replaced by Tommy Wright six minutes into the second half of England's opening match against Romania in Guadalajara. Newton also assisted in both England goals in the Quarter-Final defeat to West Germany.\n\nHe was a distinguished, if somewhat underrated, component of one of England's finest international football teams. Indeed, there is no shortage of shrewd contemporary observers who would place the side which he graced as a stylish full-back, and which was eliminated so dramatically by West Germany from the 1970 World Cup, ahead of the more famous combination which had lifted the Jules Rimet trophy four years earlier.\n"}

It is the nearest MRT station to the Bukit Timah campus of the National University of Singapore.\n\nAs Bukit Brown MRT station is currently non-operational, the section of tracks between Botanic Gardens station and Caldecott MRT station is the longest between any two stations on the Circle line.\n\nBotanic Gardens station is the only currently operational MRT station in Singapore to have an official Malay name (which is announced on Downtown line trains); two other planned future stations, Gardens by the Bay MRT station and Founders' Memorial MRT station, will also have Malay names.\n\nPrior to the opening of the station, it was named Adam. The contract for the construction and completion of Adam and Farrer stations (including of twin bored tunnelswas awarded to Taisei Corporation for approximately S$391 million in July 2004.\n\nPublic consultation of the station began in January 2006 and only two names were selected - Botanic Gardens and Cluny Road. Botanic Gardens was eventually selected because this station also connects to the popular UNESCO World Heritage Site. Cluny Road was also selected because it was around the location of a former railway station \"Cluny Road\" that closed down in 1930s. On 12 September that year, the final name is renamed to Botanic Gardens due to it being a popular offered choice by those who polled.\n\nConstruction of the Circle line station began on 10 March 2005. It had acquired some of the Botanic Gardens, but restored on 10 March 2010.\n\nConstruction of the Downtown line station began on 12 February that year. On 11 March 2012, a worker was killed at a site near the Botanic Gardens, beside the contractor's site office after a concrete slab fell on him. 35-year-old Masud al-Mamun was operating an excavator deep in the ground when the slab fell on him. Rescuers had to use a breaking tool kit to break a portion of the concrete slab. It took nearly five hours to reach the man lying motionless on the ground. This is the first casualty related case in the construction of the Downtown line.\n\nOn the morning of 3 May 2017, Downtown line (DTL) train services towards Chinatown were disrupted for 7 hours due to a platform screen door (PSD) malfunction at Botanic Gardens MRT. This, as stated by SBS Transit, the line's operator, was due to a signalling-related fault. This resulted in the doors being unable to open automatically, which meant that staff had to manually operate them whenever a train arrived at the station, which took some time and thus caused delays in train services.\n\nSBS Transit sent out an alert on Twitter at 7.31am about the fault, advising commuters to expect additional travelling time of up to 10 minutes. However, many commuters complained that the travel time was more than 10 minutes. The decision was eventually made at 9.37am to close the platform for trains heading towards Chinatown to enable engineers to resolve the fault. As a result, station staff were stationed at Botanic Gardens, Stevens and Tan Kah Kee stations to advise passengers on how to get to their destinations.\n\nThe fault was eventually rectified at 12.54pm and the platform was reopened for passenger service. However, two doors (#5 and #6) were closed for more in-depth repairs that night.\n\nThe artwork featured in the Circle line section under the Art in Transit programme is \"Aquatic Fauna No. 1\" by Kai Lam and Chua Chye Teck. The mural, displayed above the platform doors, contains symbolic imageries of water and aquatic animals using the Chinese paper cutting technique. The \"fauna\" mural not only highlights the station's proximity to the Botanic Gardens, but also complements the 2-storey high water-cascading wall in the station, the first to have such a feature within the station.\n\nThe Downtown line section features the artwork \"What is a Tree?\" by Shirley Soh. Various vistas of the Tembusu on the front lawn of the Botanic Gardens are created to pose the ontological questions.\n"}

His artistic career took place during the period of Danish art known as the Golden Age of Danish Painting. Vermehren, along with his fellow artists Christen Dalsgaard (1824–1907) and Julius Exner (1825–1910), were prominent in the Danish genre of painting; they depicted ordinary people of the country, especially farmers and other country folk. His idealised depictions helped define and encourage Denmark's period of national romanticism.\n\nVermehren was born on the island of Zealand at Ringsted, Denmark. He was the son of Peter Frederik Nikolai Vermehren and his wife, Sophie Amalie Franck.\n\nAt a young age, Vermehren worked in his father's workshop and did not have much opportunity to draw. However, he impressed Jørgen Roed (1808–1888), an artist who came from the same area. He began his artistic training in 1838, when he started drawing classes with landscape painter Hans Harder (1792–1873) at Sorø Academy. Vermehren's father did not want him to seek an art career, however the director of the Academy, poet Bernhard Severin Ingemann (1789–1862), intervened and convinced Frederik's father to let his son train as an artist.\n\nIn 1844, Vermehren went to Copenhagen, where he became a student at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\") and trained under Jørgen Roed. He exhibited his first painting, \"En Skomager i sit Køkken\" (\"A Shoemaker in his Kitchen\") at Charlottenborg in 1847. This painting was purchased by King Christian VIII, and was praised by the art critic and national art form advocate Niels Lauritz Høyen (1798–1870). In 1848, Vermehren volunteered in the First war of Schleswig, but his health did not allow him to continue. On his return home, he painted \"Reservesoldatens Afsked fra sin Familie\" (exhibited in 1850) and now hangs in the collection of the Danish National Gallery.\nIn the years 1851–1854, Vermehren exhibited only a single painting while he completed several of his more important works. One particular work, \"Hvedebrødsmanden\" (painted in 1851), now hangs in the Hirschsprung Collection. \"En jysk Faarehyrde paa Heden\" \n(painted in 1853), was exhibited in 1855 in both Copenhagen and Paris.\n\nIn 1855, Vermehren traveled with the Academy's support for two years via Cologne, Antwerp, Brussels, and Switzerland to Italy (Cervera, Gerano, Florence, Venice and Rome). In Italy, he painted interiors, street scenes, landscapes and figure studies. Vermehren also spent a short time in Paris where \"A Sheepherder from Jutland on the Prairie\" was exhibited. He came to admire the work of the French classicists, particularly Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier. Several paintings based on Italian themes were exhibited including \"En italiensk Hyrdedreng\" and \"Parti fra Byen Gerano\" (both painted in 1858).\nAfter his return to Denmark, Vermehren painted character studies, interior scenes, landscapes and genre paintings which were purchased by many Danish museums. In 1862, a stipend from the Ancker Fund (\"Det Anckerske Legat\") allowed Vermehren to travel to the Netherlands, Paris and Rome. His work was shown that same year at the International Exhibition in London.\n\nVermehren became a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1864, and began teaching there in 1865. Among his students were P. S. Krøyer (1864–1870), Kristian Zahrtmann (1864–1868), Vilhelm Hammershøi (1864–1916) and Michael Ancher (1849– 1927). As a member of the Exhibition Committee at Charlottenborg, his work was exhibited at the pan-Nordic exhibition in 1872, 1883 and 1888.\n\nVermehren continued to paint character paintings and genre paintings of Danish scenes however, from 1870 on, he was known primarily for his portraits. During this time he painted portraits of painters Jørgen Sonne and P. C. Skovgaard, and sculptor professor August Vilhelm Saabye, among others. Having traveled to Paris in 1875, he taught at the school for Drawing and Applied Arts for Women between 1877 and 1907. His work was exhibited at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1878. Afterwards, Vermehren traveled to Berlin, Dresden, and Munich in 1883, along with architect Ferdinand Meldahl.\nVermehren was given the honorable title Commander of the Dannebrog in 1892. While in his 60s, he served as a member of the Commission for National Purchase of Artworks between 1890 and 1896. In 1907, his works were exhibited at the exhibition \"Danish Painters\" at Guildhall, London.\n\nVermehren married Thomasine Ludvigne Grimer on 7 July 1857. They were the parents of Sophus Vermehren (1866-1950) and Gustav Vermehren (1863-1931) both of whom would grow up to be painters. Vermehren died on 10 January 1910 in Copenhagen at the age of 86 and was buried in Assistens Cemetery.\n\nSince Vermehren's death, his works have been shown in numerous exhibitions in Denmark. His work was shown in Rome in 1977, where his paintings were part of an exhibition of Danish paintings made in Rome during the 1800s. His works are in the collection of many Danish museums, including the National Art Museum, the Hirschsprung Collection, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, and local art museums in Aarhus, West Zealand, and Koldinghus. \n\n\n"}

It was used as the set for the Irish television series \"Glenroe\", which ran through the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe village has a large industrial estate to the south. An area of marshland runs along the coast from Kilcoole south to Wicklow town, called the \"Murragh\". This area is home to many endangered species of plant and animal. The beach in Kilcoole is the summertime home of the little tern, one of the few places in Ireland where these birds nest. Within the village, is an area of flora known as the \"Rock\" which is a huge rock/hill that predates the Cambrian Period.\n\nKilcoole is in the Roman Catholic parish of Kilquade, and the local church, St. Anthony's Church, cost £35,000 to build in the 1960s.\n\nNext to the railway station is a monument commemorating the landing of 600 rifles and ammunition for the Irish Volunteers on board the \"Chotah\" by Sir Thomas Myles in August 1914. It is eclipsed by accounts of the contemporary landing of Volunteer's arms at Howth on board the \"Asgard\". On 1 August 1914, 600 Mauser rifles and 20,000 rounds of ammunition was landed at the beach in Kilcoole.\n\nThe arms and ammunition was smuggled using Thomas Myles's boat The Chotah during the night. When the arms were landed they were removed on bicycles and in vehicles by volunteers. The arms were taken to Patrick Pearse's school, St Enda's, in Rathfarnham, County Dublin.\n\nColáiste Chraobh Abhann is the community secondary college, located on the southern outskirts of the village of Kilcoole. It currently numbers 700 students from Kilcoole, Newtownmountkennedy, Delgany, Roundwood and Greystones. Opened in September 2003, the college held its first state examinations in June 2006.\n\nKilcoole Primary School formerly consisted of Saint Anthony's Boys' National School and Saint Brigids Girls' National School, which were amalgamated in 2010. Junior students are now taught in the building formerly occupied by Saint Brigid's and the Saint Anthony's building accommodates pupils in the latter half of primary schooling.\n\nKilcoole Athletics Club was founded in 1970. Its members have represented and captained Ireland at all levels up to and including Olympic Games. Kilcoole AC athletes have set and still hold national, provincial, intervarsity and schools records in cross country and javelin events. The club holds one of the longest standing athletics records when a ladies team set the provincial (Leinster) record for the 4 × 400 m relay in 1987.\n\nThe National Cross Country Championships have been hosted in the village three times; in 1975, 1979 and 1997. The venue for the first two events was Fox's Field on Cooldross Lane (the Holywell Crescent road cuts through where the finishing line was situated). On the third occasion the venue was Druids Glen Golf Resort. This was immediately prior to the construction of the Druids Heath course. The finish line for this event was situated where the 12th fairway is currently.\n\nDruids Glen Golf Resort, which hosted the Irish open from 1996 to 1999 as well as the National Cross Country Athletics Championships in 1997, is located less than a kilometre from Kilcoole, on the Newtownmountkennedy road.

Druids Heath Golf Course, another championship course, is also located in Druids Glen.\n\nSaint Anthony's Football Club provides football for boys and girls from age six upwards. Almost 300 members make up their competing teams from under eight through under eighteen and adult.\n\nKilcoole GAA fields teams in both hurling and Gaelic football, with representation for both men and women at junior and juvenile levels.\n\nDublin Bus only provides a service between Kilcoole and Dublin on its very infrequent 84X bus route, with a journey time of about 80 minutes; the 84 bus terminates at Blackrock. Iarnród Éireann has a station at the beach; Kilcoole railway station opened on 30 October 1855. There are limited train services along this line.

A more regular DART (Electric train) service runs from Greystones to Dublin city centre and beyond to Howth and Malahide.\n\nKilcoole has acted as a musical hub over the past 15 years, for bands in punk and post-rock. Acts included Adebisi Shank, Heathers, the Brian Meakin Band, Kidd Blunt, Enemies, Croupier and Foot in Mouth. More recently a new collective named 'Boosegank' has emerged bringing together younger bands from the Kilcoole area such as Birds, Jack Latin and Doxy. The Hive recording Studio is also situated in Kilcoole, and has recorded for Adebisi Shank, Enemies, Heathers, Bacchus and others.\n\nThe Kilcoole Music Festival is an annual festival which was started in 1955 by the then district nurse, Ms. Mary Kiernan, who saw a need to help the children of the area develop their talents. The festival awards individuals in over 50 classes ranging from vocal solos to orchestras, and flute to rock guitar.\n\nKilcoole was the setting for the long-running hit TV show \"Glenroe\", running from 1983 until 2001, which was broadcast on RTÉ One. At its height, it had over one million viewers, making it one of the most watched programmes on Irish television. The farm on which it was based is now an open farm and hosts events annually.\n\nIn more recent times, Kilcoole has been the setting for scenes in the comedy series \"Moone Boy\" and \"Damo and Ivor\".\n\n\n\n"}

After studying opera in Milan, Italy, he made his London stage debut in 1891 in the tenor title role of the opera \"Ivanhoe\" by Arthur Sullivan and soon appeared in other operas. In 1894 he first appeared at Covent Garden Theatre. For three years, he was the principal tenor at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, also appearing in the pantomime there and elsewhere. In 1896, he created the tenor lead, Mike Murphy, in Charles Villiers Stanford's opera \"Shamus O'Brien\", also playing the role on tour and in America.\n\nAfter a series of concert engagements in London, O'Mara travelled again to America to create the tenor lead in Reginald De Koven's \"The Highwayman\". He was a leading tenor with the Moody-Manners Opera Company in London from 1902 to 1908, also performing extensively in Ireland with the company. O'Mara was granted the Freedom of the City of Limerick in 1908, the only time that a singer achieved this honour. In 1908, in Patrick Bidwell's musical \"Peggy Machree\" on Broadway in New York City. In 1909, O'Mara returned to Britain and joined the Thomas Beecham Company, singing tenor leads over the next few years, while also continuing to perform in concerts. In 1912, he founded O'Mara's Travelling Opera Company, in which he was the principal tenor until his farewell performance as Lohengrin in 1926. In all, O'Mara sang 67 tenor roles. In 1926, he was the first tenor to broadcast in Ireland.\n\nBorn at Limerick, Ireland, O'Mara was the second youngest of thirteen children of James O'Mara, a politician and owner of a bacon factory, and Hanora \"nee\" Foley, who died when O'Mara was a teenager. He was educated at a Jesuit school, the Crescent College. As a boy, he sang as a chorister in St John's Cathedral, Limerick. At eighteen he sailed for a year aboard an ocean liner travelling between Dundee and Calcutta before returning to his father's business, \"totally cured\" of the desire to live a life at sea. He also sang in the choir of St. Michael's Church in Limerick. O'Mara's family was prominent in Limerick, producing a number of mayors of the city, including his nephew Stephen O'Mara (1886–1959), who was mayor from 1921–1923.\n\nEncouraged by his friend J. F. Murray, O'Mara studied opera in Milan under Signor Moretti for two years, and in 1891 he made his London stage debut when he landed the title role in the original production of the opera \"Ivanhoe\" by Arthur Sullivan (of Gilbert and Sullivan) at the newly built Royal English Opera House in London. This was followed by \"La Basoche\" at the same opera house, after which he returned to Milan for further study.\n\nFrom 1893 to 1894 he toured Britain and Ireland with Sir Augustus Harris's Italian Opera Company to sing the principal tenor roles in \"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Faust\", \"Pagliacci\", \"Carmen\", \"Lohengrin\" and \"Die Meistersinger\", among others, his strong Heldentenor voice being particularly appropriate for the latter two roles. In 1894 he first appeared at Covent Garden Theatre. For three years, O'Mara was the principal tenor at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, also appearing in the pantomime of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" there. He then played in the pantomime \"Aladdin\" at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Liverpool. In 1896, he created the tenor lead, Mike Murphy, in Charles Villiers Stanford's opera \"Shamus O'Brien\", with Henry Wood conducting. After a tour of Britain and Ireland in \"Shamus O'Brien\", the Harris company brought the opera to America in 1897, where, with his new wife, the former Miss Power, O'Mara enjoyed great personal success. Throughout the rest of his career, Mike Murphy would remain one of O'Mara's signature roles.\n\nO'Mara and his wife returned to London for a series of concert engagements, but in the Autumn of 1897, they travelled again to America where O'Mara created the tenor lead in Reginald De Koven's \"The Highwayman.\" O'Mara gave many private concerts at the beginning of the new century, but happily returned to opera as leading tenor with the Moody-Manners Opera Company in London from 1902 to 1908, performing in \"Maritana\", \"Cavalleria\", \"Faust\", \"Lohengrin\", \"Pagliacci\", \"Il trovatore\", \"Carmen\", Charles Gounod's \"Roméo et Juliette\", and the first English-language production of Puccini's \"Madame Butterfly\" (1907), also performing extensively in Ireland with the company. O'Mara was granted the Freedom of the City of Limerick in 1908, the only time that a singer achieved this honour.\nO'Mara achieved a number of \"firsts\" for Ireland and Irish tenors: He was the first tenor in Ireland to sing Enzo in \"La Gloconda\" and in 1908 the first such Rodolfo in \"La bohème\". Later he was the first to sing Cavaradossi in Ireland and in the same season was in the Irish premiere of \"Samson et Dalila.\" O'Mara's fame spread even further when he starred, in 1908, in Patrick Bidwell's musical \"Peggy Machree\" at The Broadway Theatre in New York City, earning uniformly enthusiastic reviews for his acting as well as his singing. In 1909, O'Mara returned to Britain and joined the Thomas Beecham Company, singing in \"Carmen\", \"Faust\" and \"Tales of Hoffman\", among others over the next few years, while also continuing to perform in concerts.\n\nA recording of O'Mara survives from 1901, which was featured on Mo Cheol Thu, RTÉ Radio 1, on 25 October 1992. His recordings included \"An April Birthday\" and \"Friend and Lover\", by Landon Ronald, in 1902, and \"Ochone! When I used to be young\" from \"Seamus O'Brien\", 1911.\n\nIn 1912, he founded \"O'Mara's Travelling Opera Company\", in which he was the principal tenor until 1926. In 1913 he opened their Dublin season singing Raoul in \"The Huguenots\". At the Theatre Royal, Leeds, his company performed Puccini's \"La bohème\" and \"Madame Butterfly\" in 1918 and Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" in 1921. The company also revived many Michael Balfe works. In all, O'Mara sang 67 tenor roles. The \"Irish Times\" of Dublin wrote in February 1918: \"Mr. O'Mara's \"Lohengrin\" is to my mind one of his best parts, it is not a hurricane of passion like 'Tannhäuser', it demands a purer vocalism, a quiet dignity, a calm and spiritual character, and yet, at the back of it all, an abundance of reserve power. This is what we get from Mr. O'Mara, we never lose sight of the fact that his \"Lohengrin\" has come from another sphere and that no earthly Prince has power to restrain him, O'Mara sang his music with such fervour.\" His farewell performance was as \"Lohengrin\" in 1926.\n\nIn 1926, O'Mara was the first tenor to broadcast in Ireland at the opening of the new Irish radio station (Raidio 2RN – now R.T.É.). He and his wife had five children, Eileen, Nora, Power, Moya and Joey.\n\nO'Mara died in Dublin at the age of 63.\n\n"}

While it proposed to unite people above party lines, it also promoted wariness of \"foreign influence and intervention\" in national politics. The opposing view, both inside Zimbabwe and abroad, held that the service indoctrinated its members with absolute loyalty to ZANU-PF and trained them for military operations to enforce its dominance.\nThe government planned to make the program mandatory for all youths.\n\nAccording to an opposition group, members of the youth service were taught exclusively from ZANU-PF campaign materials and speeches.

Members consisted of Matt and Bubba Kadane (vocals and guitar), Tench Coxe (guitar), Kris Wheat (bass), and Trini Martinez (drums). The band released several EPs and three LPs on Trance Syndicate, touring intermittently. Bedhead's music was generally subdued, with three electric guitars and one electric bass guitar over sung or spoken vocals. Allmusic dubbed the group \"the quintessential indie rock band,\" and \"Tiny Mix Tapes\" gave their final album \"Transaction de Novo\" a perfect 5/5 score.\n\nIn 1999, a year after the breakup of Bedhead, Matt and Bubba Kadane went on to form The New Year, a band with a style similar to Bedhead's.\n\nThe roots of the band trace back to brothers Matt and Bubba Kadane playing music together as children in Wichita Falls, Texas. They later began playing music together in Dallas, Texas. Drummer Trini Martinez was the first addition to the duo's band in 1990, followed by guitarist Tench Coxe and bassist Kris Wheat. The band was formed into Bedhead in 1991. After playing their debut show in Austin in early 1992, they released two early singles on Dallas-based record label Direct Hit Records, one in 1992 and one in 1993.\n\nIn 1993 the band came to the attention of King Coffey, drummer of the Butthole Surfers and founder of Trance Syndicate Records, who signed them to Trance Syndicate shortly after hearing them. Bedhead's debut album, \"WhatFunLifeWas\", was released in 1994, to positive reviews. \"Sputnik Music\" gave \"WhatFunLifeWas\" 4/5 stars, and it received 4.5/5 stars from Allmusic.\n\n\"Sputnik Music\" stated that the album's themes touch on loss and depression, \"but with a sense of the profound. \"WhatFunLifeWas\" is a modest album; slow indie rock with a hint of the epic, that draws upon its broodiness to create a serenely personal atmosphere.\" Allmusic noted the band's careful use of both loud and soft dynamics, stating \"The various comparisons to the Velvet Underground, Joy Division, and Spacemen 3 all make a certain sense, but...Bedhead have much more of an individual sensibility...rather than simply rehashing.\"\n\nThey released two EPs before their second full-length, \"Beheaded\". The first EP was a live recording taken on March 31, 1994, titled \"4songCDEP19:10.\" The group launched its first expansive tour in the middle of 1995, and released the EP \"The Dark Ages\" in February 1996.\"\n\nTheir second LP \"Beheaded\" was released on Trance Syndicate on October 24, 1996. \"Beheaded\" received 4/5 stars from Allmusic, with a positive review stating, \"at the heart of the band is an indie rock sound that can be traced back to the most pleasant material of the Velvet Underground. A trio of guitars lays down unexceptional, strummed accompaniments; vocalists employ a reserved sing-speak; the drummer maintains a lazy pulse. However, with Bedhead these elements are so perfectly executed that the music seems to play itself. \"Beheaded\" represents another stop on the road to slow-burning, soaring, indie rock/pop perfection.\"\n\nTheir last LP, \"Transaction de Novo\", was recorded by Steve Albini and released in 1998. In a departure from their usual sound, \"Transaction De Novo\" featured more up-tempo, heavily distorted songs than its predecessors. \"Transaction de Novo\" received 4.5/5 stars from Allmusic, with a positive review stating \"It's hard to imagine the group perfecting this sound much further.\" The album received a perfect 5/5 score from \"Tiny Mix Tapes\".\n\nBedhead broke up shortly after the release of \"Transaction De Novo\", in 1998. After their breakup, the \"Lepidoptera/Leper\" 10\" single was released in October 1998 on Trance Syndicate. This was followed by \"Macha Loved Bedhead,\" on April 25, 2000: a collaboration between the Kadane Brothers and Macha released on Jetset Records. After the band ended, guitarist Tench Coxe went on to earn a PhD in Russian Literature from Columbia University.\n\n\nThe Kadane brothers went on to form The New Year, and signed to Touch and Go Records. While still playing with The New Year, in 2012 Bubba and Matt Kadane formed Overseas with David Bazan of Pedro The Lion and Will Johnson of Centro-matic. Their debut album was released on June 11, 2013.\n\nBedhead's music was generally subdued, with a polyphonic sound based on the interlocking of single-line melodies played by three electric guitars and one electric bass guitar (often played with a capo), nearly always using clean (undistorted) tones, prompting comparisons to the Velvet Underground.\n\nAccording to Allmusic, \"What distinguished [Bedhead] was the way it combined [indie rock]'s modest ambitions with careful song construction and rock & roll's sense of grand dynamic excitement. This was the quintessential indie rock band because it delivered some of the best the genre is capable of: workaday vocals that actually work, gorgeous melodies (though uncommercial, this music doesn't have to be indigestible), and dynamics that could crush the listener.\"\n\nThe group's vocals were often delivered in such a low key manner that they could be difficult to decipher. This unusual sound was dubbed by some critics as \"slo-core,\" referring to the slow tempos of many of the band's songs, though the band's members objected to the labeling in interviews. In reality, many of the group's songs only begin slow before building in speed, intensity and volume. Bedhead also experimented with time signatures less commonly used in rock music, by playing some songs in 7/8 or 5/4 meter.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2106776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106776", "title": "Just compensation", "text": "Just compensation\n\nJust compensation is required to be paid by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (and counterpart state constitutions) when private property is taken (or in some states, taken or damaged). Usually, the government (condemnor) files an eminent domain action to take private property for \"public use.\", but when it fails to do so and pay for the taking, the owner may seek compensation in an action called \"inverse condemnation.\" For reasons of expedience, courts have been generally using fair market value as the measure of just compensation, reasoning that this is the amount that a willing seller would accept in a voluntary sales transaction, and therefore it should also be payable in an involuntary one. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged that \"fair market value\" as defined by it falls short of what sellers would demand and receive in voluntary transactions.\n\nMarket value is the prevailing, but not exclusive measure of Just Compensation. Fair Market Value is defined by appraisers as the most probable price, in terms of cash that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller, each being fully informed of the property's good and bad features, with the property being exposed on the market for an adequate time to attract offers. But in eminent domain cases value is defined as the highest price obtainable in the open market. That value may not be influenced by factors that affect the market because of the imminence of the eminent domain taking. In other words, the property must be valued as if the project for which it is being taken did not exist — this is known as the \"project influence\" doctrine.\n\nSince fair market value involves a future, hypothetical transaction (the property's sale has not yet taken place at the time of valuation) fair market value is shown by the opinion of expert appraisers, or the property's owner(s).\n\nA fundamental attribute of property that determines its Market Value is its highest and best use, which is its most profitable legal use. This need not be the property's current use, nor the use(s) for which the property is currently zoned, if it is established that there is a probability of zone change. Highest and best use is often the subject of contentious litigation. Condemning Authorities commonly argue for Highest and Best Uses that are far less intensive than what a private property owner's appraiser has in mind. This is often the real battleground in eminent domain valuation cases.\n\nIn unusual cases measures of compensation other than fair market value can be employed; United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U.S. 114 (1951) (increased operational loss of a coal company during its temporary seizure by the government deemed to be the measure of compensation).\n\nIn eminent domain cases, the standard is often not the most probable price, but the highest price obtainable in a voluntary sale transaction involving the subject property. Since the condemnation deprives the owner of the opportunity to take his or her time to obtain top dollar in the market, the law provides it by defining fair market value as the highest price the property would bring in the open market.\n\nMarket value does not include incidental losses (e.g., cost of moving, loss of business goodwill, etc.), but some of these losses are made compensable in part by statutes, such as the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act (Code of Federal Regulations 49) and its state counterparts. The judicial denial of compensation for business losses inflicted when a business conducted on the taken land is destroyed by the taking, has been the subject of much controversy and severe criticism by legal commentators. Nonetheless, only one state (Alaska) allows their recovery in all cases and so do a few others upon a showing that it is impossible for the affected business to relocate. Some states allow recovery of business losses by statute.\n\nLikewise, the property owner's attorneys' and appraisers' fees are not included in just compensation. In some states they are recoverable by statute when the owner recovers compensation that exceeds the Condemning Authority's offer or evidence by a specific amount. In California and New York an award of such fees is discretionary with the court when this occurs.\n\nWhen payment of just compensation is delayed, the owner is also entitled to receive interest on the amount of the late payment.\n\nAn important but largely ignored aspect of just compensation in eminent domain is that where the condemnor takes the owner's entire parcel of land, it does not actually pay anything (except for transactional costs) because it only exchanges one asset (money) for another asset of equal value (land at its fair market value). So at the end of the transaction—assuming a fair valuation process—both sides are theoretically as well off as they were before. Their balance sheets are unchanged. The British use more accurate terminology and call eminent domain \"Compulsory Purchase\" which is economically accurate, if not entirely grammatical (it is the sale not the purchase that is compulsory).\n"}

It was created by young people of Wales and the Welsh Assembly Government in order to help under-25s in Wales attain their rights under Article 12 of the UNCRC.\nFunky Dragon’s main tasks are to make sure that the views of children and young people are heard, particularly by the Welsh Assembly Government, and to support participation in decision-making at national level.\n\nThe Grand Council is the main body of Funky Dragon, and comprises 100 young people: 4 from each of the 22 unitary authorities in Wales and 12 co-option seats for other organisations. The co-option seats are available for election at Funky Dragon's annual general meeting, usually held in July. The seats are detailed as follows.\nMembers of the grand council are also elected onto the management committee where a chair is elected.\n\nStatutory Sector – 22 places. Voluntary Sector – 22 places. School Councils – 22 places. Equality – 22 places.\n\nThe term local authority-wide forum is used as some forums representing the geographical area of a local authority are either independent or are supported by an agency other than the Local Authority such as the Prince's Trust or the Children’s Society.\n\nEach Local Authority Wide Forum is offered four places for young people. See above for the breakdown. It is up to each forum to democratically elect their representatives. Representatives are asked to commit to a 2-year term with the Grand Council.\n\nEach Local Authority Wide Forum will be responsible for carrying out its own election process. The only conditions Funky Dragon puts on the process are:\n\n\nThese are:\n\n\nEvery year Grand Council representatives get the chance to meet with Assembly Ministers to question them on issues that are affecting young people across Wales. During the meetings, the young people are able to follow up on any issues talked of in a previous meeting and use the time to get to know the Ministers better.\n\nThe questions are decided by the grand council, youth forums, specific interest groups and any other groups of young people wishing to ask a question and get an answer from Assembly Members.\n\nPast Ministers who have attended the meetings include Jane Davidson, Minister for Education Lifelong Learning and Skills and Jane Hutt, Minister for Assembly Business Equalities and Children\n\nThe Funky Dragon AGM happens once a year in the Welsh Assembly's building in Cardiff Bay.\n\nThe Grand Council and young people from across Wales are able to come together and discuss their views/opinions and then question Ministers during Question Time. The Grand Council members meet Ministers and Officials to discuss how young people from all over Wales can effect change at a national level.\n\nTime is then spent in the Assembly chamber to complete elections, declaration of accounts and any other business.\n\nFunky Dragon has become known for its 'Funky Dragon does the Oscars' award ceremony in the evening, recognizing the hard work and achievements of Grand Council Representatives\n\nEach of the Sub-Groups has an Assembly Member responsible for the development of every area - included here are articles, reports, documents, proposals, committee minutes for each sub-group area.\n\n\nEach Sub-Group area has 2 Grand Council representatives as Co-Chairs within Funky Dragon, and it is their duty to take forward the ideas discussed throughout the year at Grand Council residentials and the Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\nOur Rights Our Story is a report which was written by a steering group on behalf of the grand council. It was to inform the United Nations Convention on the Rights of a Child, how the rights of children in Wales are granted.\n\nIn February 2006 Funky Dragon received funding to carry out the biggest piece of research into the views of young people in Wales. The project was steered by Grand Council members from Funky Dragon who were involved in developing the questions and activities, recruiting staff and analysing the results of the work.\n\nThe views of over 12,000 young people were gathered through a national survey, workshops and interviews with special interest groups, and additional funding was received earlier this year for extra research into the views of over 2,500 children aged 7–10 (a separate report, Why do people’s ages go up not down? was produced).\n\nOur Rights, Our Story focused on specific areas of children’s rights\n\n•Education\n•Health\n•Information\n•Participation\n•Special Interest Groups\nKey findings identified by the children and young people included:\n\n•Increasing children and young people’s awareness that they have rights\n•The need for schools to offer guidance and support for young people to help them develop their opinions\n•Being listened to more by the government\n•For under 11’s to have a greater say in decisions affecting them.\n‘Our Rights, Our Story’ has been submitted to the UNCRC in June 2008, alongside the Welsh Assembly Government report and the alternative NGO report, Stop, look, listen. more information can be found on the funky dragon website\n\nFunky Dragon received its core funding from the Welsh government from its creation in 2002 until its end in 2014. In its last complete financial year, it received £418,000 from the Welsh government, £326,000 from the European Union and smaller amounts from other sources. In 2014, Funky Dragon were asked to apply for funding through the Children and Families Delivery Grant but this agency turned them down. Despite protests, Funky Dragon had to close down in 2014.\n\n"}

The album was produced by another Atlanta native, former Marvelous 3 frontman and \"Rolling Stone\" noted producer Butch Walker (Sevendust, Rock Star Supernova, Avril Lavigne). Injected made a video for its first single, \"Faithless,\" and the song became a top 20 single on modern and active rock charts, reaching as high as No. 3 on MTVs rock countdown. Album cuts such as \"I-IV-V\" and \"Burn It Black\" were also included on soundtracks for films such as \"The Fast and the Furious\", \"Spider-Man\", \"The Scorpion King\", among others.\n\nInjected spent years touring the country in support of the record, and played venues large and small with artists such as Local H, Saliva, Hoobastank, Greenwheel, Jerry Cantrell, Tommy Lee, Nickelback, Default, Sevendust, Incubus, Fu Manchu, Speeddealer, Damone, and Papa Roach. At the end of touring the US/Canada in 2002, guitarist Jade Lemons and Injected parted ways. Danny Grady (lead vocals/guitar), Steve Slovisky (bass), and Chris Wojtal (drums) played the remaining dates as a trio. Lemons went on to play with Kenna, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and other bands.\n\nFans received a glimmer of hope in summer 2006, as rumors circulated that Injected would continue/reform with its original line-up (including Lemons). However, on August 20, 2006, Lemons posted comments on a fan-created Injected MySpace page:\n\"...well the rumors aren't true (anymore). We flirted with getting back together, but it's just not gonna happen. too many day to day things keep us having to focus on paying bills, eating, mowing the grass and expanding our waist sizes. oh well...almost right? thanks for the love my friends! take care, Jade\"\n\nOn May 9, 2009, Injected played with all four original members for the first time in seven years. They performed the Cheap Trick track, \"I Want You to Want Me\" at Smith's Olde Bar in Atlanta as one of 500 acts at the charitable 10 night event, 500 Songs for Kids. During 2010, Grady and Lemons began working together with Kyle Spence on drums to record some new material. On May 18, 2013, Injected reunited to play a two-song set at 500 Songs for Kids Benefit Festival.\n\nOn April 6, 2016 Jade Lemons died from a drug overdose.\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma's, Upside, recorded the Injected songs \"Monday\" and \"Daylight\" for their 2006 album \"Jim Beam and the American Dream\".\n\n\"American Idol\" winner David Cook put Injected's song \"Spun Again (Bar-Ba-Sol)\" (retitled Bar-Ba-Sol) on his 2008 self-titled platinum selling debut. \"Bar-Ba-Sol\" was released as a single on March 23, 2009 to US Active and Mainstream Rock stations.\n\nButch Walker recorded \"So At Last\" with Danny on Letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2106826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106826", "title": "Dale Mabry Highway", "text": "Dale Mabry Highway\n\nDale Mabry Highway is a north–south road in Tampa, Florida. The majority of its length consists of three lanes each direction plus a central turn-lane and often includes a right-turn lane. It begins at the MacDill Air Force Base entrance in South Tampa and ends by merging with US 41 just north of the Pasco County border. The highway carries multiple designations, carrying US 92 for an approximately five-mile () stretch between Hillsborough Avenue and Gandy Boulevard. It is the longest street in Tampa.\n\nDale Mabry Highway has many items of interest, including Raymond James Stadium, George M. Steinbrenner Field, Tampa International Airport, the Dale Mabry branch of the Hillsborough Community College, Plant High School, Gaither High School, shopping centers, car dealerships and restaurants.\n\nDale Mabry Highway carries several designations throughout its route.\n\nThe lane counts along the highway are as follows.\n\nThe speed limit for most the length is 45 mph (72 km/h). There is a 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limit on the segment north of State Road 568.\n\nThe southern portion of Dale Mabry Highway between MacDill AFB and Gandy Boulevard (US 92, SR 600) is designated as State Road 573's entire length. This portion is also cosigned with unsigned SR 685. This section is four lanes wide, divided. Until the late 1990s, a Jai Alai fronton stood on the west side of the highway just south of Gandy Boulevard. The facility closed in July 1998 after 45 years of operation after the parent company of the fronton sold the property for $8.3 million. Today, a Home Depot and Sam's Club store sit on the property.\n\nOriginally a two-lane stretch, a widening project took place in the 1970s, increasing the road to four lanes. The project was at least partly contributed by the construction of the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway in 1974. In 2002, a roundabout was constructed just north of the main gate to MacDill as part of a security enhancement and road improvement project for the base.\n\nThe section of Dale Mabry Highway between Gandy Boulevard and Hillsborough Avenue is signed as U.S. Route 92 (State Road 600). Much of this portion is also cosigned with unsigned SR 685. This stretch of Dale Mabry Highway snakes through several south Tampa business areas and a residential district before approaching Raymond James Stadium with the SR 685 concurrency ending at Henderson Boulevard. The section of Dale Mabry between Gandy Boulevard and Kennedy Boulevard (SR 60) remains four lanes with moderate improvements taking place over the years, such as intersection improvements. The section of highway from Kennedy northward is six lanes with many businesses surrounding the highway.\n\nUntil 2000, the section of highway between Gandy Boulevard and Euclid Ave was two lanes. Additionally a 1950s era overpass stood over a CSX rail corridor just north of the Lee Roy Selmon Crosstown Expressway. The overpass was torn down in the late 1990s and replaced with an at-grade railroad crossing as part of a widening project which increased that section to four lanes.\n\nThe section of Dale Marby Highway between Hillsborough Avenue and Busch Boulevard/Gunn Highway is signed as a portion of State Road 580. The Hillsborough Avenue interchange is a remnant of a failed freeway plan along Dale Mabry Highway. The original North Crosstown Expressway was supposed to have connected Dale Mabry at this (or the MLK) intersection, but was killed as well. Along the highway in the stadium and Northdale area are many businesses, more specifically car dealerships. The overall scene along Dale Mabry however, begins to shift from to a more suburban setting. The Busch/Gunn Interchange at the end of this stretch is also a remnant of the canceled expressway.\n\nThe northern portion of Dale Mabry Highway between Busch Boulevard/Gunn Highway and U.S. Route 41 is designated as State Road 597's entire length. This section of Dale Mabry Highway continues to be four to six lanes north of Bearss Ave up to the Veterans Expressway. The line of businesses and apartment/condo developments continue along the highway until the Veterans Expressway. North of the expressway, the highway changes to a more rural setting towards the terminus of US 41.\n\nNorth of the expressway, the highway used to narrow back down to two lanes as it snaked through a rural setting to US 41. This scene has since changed, as Dale Mabry between the Veterans and US 41 was widened to four lanes in 1996.\n\nDale Mabry Highway is also one of the last roads in Hillsborough County to include concrete (driving surface) segments (Hillsborough Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard are the other major, non-interstate, arteries that have concrete segments). Originally, the concrete segment was continuous, stretching from MacDill AFB to just south of Hillsborough Ave. However, after numerous intersection modifications and widening over the years, some of the original areas have disappeared as they were replaced by asphalt surfaces. The existing concrete surfaces have since been rehabilitated, though there is a 1-mile (or less) exception between Spruce and Cypress Streets. The only reason why that noted section was not rehabilitated is because of pending reconstruction on Interstate 275.\n\nOriginally constructed in 1943 to connect MacDill Air Force Base with Drew Field, Dale Mabry Highway was named after Dale Mabry, a Florida native and World War I aviator. Dale Mabry runs along what was originally called Vera Ave. according to land plots from the Hillsborough County Property Appraiser. The highway has seen many changes throughout the years, including an extension to US 41 in Pasco County, and several major widening projects.\n\nDuring the 1960s/1970s, a portion of Dale Mabry Highway was to be converted into a limited-access highway between what was then I-4 (now I-275) to the Northwest Hillsborough Expressway (now Veterans Expressway's eastern terminus). The plan was scrapped after overpasses over Hillsborough Avenue and Busch Boulevard were built, relieving congestion at what would be very busy intersections.\n\nDale Mabry Highway is typical of a roadway in a suburban sprawl setting. The road is a minimum four lanes wide along its entirety and in many places has wide medians, no sidewalks, and open drainage.\n\n"}
{"id": "2106840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106840", "title": "Runtime system", "text": "Runtime system\n\nIn computer programming, a runtime system, also called runtime environment, primarily implements portions of an execution model . This is not to be confused with the runtime lifecycle phase of a program, during which the runtime system is in operation.\n\nMost programming languages have some form of runtime system that provides an environment in which programs run. This environment may address a number of issues including the management of application memory, how the program accesses variables, mechanisms for passing parameters between procedures, interfacing with the operating system, and otherwise. The compiler makes assumptions depending on the specific runtime system to generate correct code. Typically the runtime system will have some responsibility for setting up and managing the stack and heap, and may include features such as garbage collection, threads or other dynamic features built into the language.\n\nEvery programming language specifies an execution model, and many implement at least part of that model in a runtime system. One possible definition of runtime system behavior is, among others, any behavior not directly attributable to the program itself. This definition includes, as part of the runtime system, things such as putting parameters onto the stack before a function call, the behavior of disk I/O, and parallel execution of related behaviors.\n\nBy this definition, essentially every language has a runtime system, including compiled languages, interpreted languages, and embedded domain-specific languages. Even API invoked stand alone execution models such as Pthreads (POSIX threads) have a runtime system that is the implementation of execution model's behavior.\n\nMost scholarly papers on runtime systems focus on the implementation details of parallel runtime systems. A notable example of a parallel runtime system is that of Cilk, a popular parallel programming model.\nIn addition, the proto-runtime toolkit was created to simplify the creation of parallel runtime systems.\n\nIn addition to the execution model behavior, a runtime system may also perform support services such as type checking, debugging, or code generation and optimization.\n\nThe runtime system is also the gateway by which a running program interacts with the runtime environment, which contains not only state values that are accessible during program execution, but also active entities that can be interacted with during program execution like disk drives and people via keyboards. For example, environment variables are features of many operating systems, and are part of the runtime environment; a running program can access them via the runtime system. Likewise, hardware devices such as a DVD drive are active entities that a program can interact with via a runtime system.\n\nA unique application of a runtime environment (RTE) is within an operating system (OS) that \"only\" allows that RTE to run, meaning from boot until power-down the entire OS is dedicated to only the application(s) running within that RTE. Any other code that tries to run or any failures in the application(s) break the RTE which breaks the OS which stops all processing and requires a re-boot. If the boot is from read-only memory, an extremely secure, simple, single-mission system is created.\n\nExamples for such kind of directly bundled runtime systems include:\n\n\nAs a simple example of a basic runtime system, the runtime system of the C language is a particular set of instructions inserted into the executable image by the compiler. Among other things, these instructions manage the processor stack, create space for local variables, and copy function-call parameters onto the top of the stack. There are often no clear criteria for deciding which language behavior is considered inside the runtime system versus which behavior is part of the source program. For C, the setup of the stack is part of the runtime system, as opposed to part of the semantics of an individual program, because it maintains a global invariant that holds over all executions. This systematic behavior implements the execution model of the language, as opposed to implementing semantics of the particular program text which is directly translated into code that computes results.\n\nOne way to observe this separation between the semantics of a particular program and the runtime environment is to compile a program into an object file containing all the functions versus compiling an entire program to an executable binary. The object file will only contain assembly code relevant to those functions, while the executable binary will contain additional code used to implement the runtime environment. The object file, on one hand, may be missing information from the runtime environment that will be resolved by linking. On the other hand, the code in the object file still depends on assumptions in the runtime system; for example, a function may read parameters from a particular register or stack location, depending on the calling convention used by the runtime environment.\n\nAnother example is the case of using an application programming interface (API) to interact with a runtime system. The calls to that API look the same as calls to a regular software library, however at some point during the call the execution model changes. The runtime system implements an execution model different from that of the language the library is written in terms of. A person reading the code of a normal library would be able to understand the library's behavior by just knowing the language the library was written in. However, a person reading the code of the API that invokes a runtime system would not be able to understand the behavior of the API call just by knowing the language the call was written in. At some point, via some mechanism, the execution model stops being that of the language the call is written in and switches over to being the execution model implemented by the runtime system. For example, the trap instruction is one method of switching execution models. This difference is what distinguishes an API-invoked execution model, such as Pthreads, from a usual software library. Both Pthreads calls and software library calls are invoked via an API, but Pthreads behavior cannot be understood in terms of the language of the call. Rather, Pthreads calls bring into play an outside execution model, which is implemented by the Pthreads runtime system (this runtime system is often the OS kernel).\n\nAs an extreme example, the physical CPU itself can be viewed as an implementation of the runtime system of a specific assembly language. In this view, the execution model is implemented by the physical CPU and memory systems. As an analogy, runtime systems for higher-level languages are themselves implemented using some other languages. This creates a hierarchy of runtime systems, with the CPU itself—or actually its logic at the microcode layer or below—acting as the lowest-level runtime system.\n\nSome compiled or interpreted languages provide an interface that allows application code to interact directly with the runtime system. An example is the codice_1 class in the Java language. The class allows code (that is animated by one thread) to do things such as start and stop other threads. Normally, core aspects of a language's behavior such as task scheduling and resource management are not accessible in this fashion.\n\nHigher-level behaviors implemented by a runtime system may include tasks such as drawing text on the screen or making an Internet connection. It is often the case that operating systems provide these kinds of behaviors as well, and when available, the runtime system is implemented as an abstraction layer that translates the invocation of the runtime system into an invocation of the operating system. This hides the complexity or variations in the services offered by different operating systems. This also implies that the OS kernel can itself be viewed as a runtime system, and that the set of OS calls that invoke OS behaviors may be viewed as interactions with a runtime system.\n\nIn the limit, the runtime system may provide services such as a P-code machine or virtual machine, that hide even the processor's instruction set. This is the approach followed by many interpreted languages such as AWK, and some languages like Java, which are meant to be compiled into some machine-independent intermediate representation code (such as bytecode). This arrangement simplifies the task of language implementation and its adaptation to different machines, and improves efficiency of sophisticated language features such as reflection. It also allows the same program to be executed on any machine without an explicit recompiling step, a feature that has become very important since the proliferation of the World Wide Web. To speed up execution, some runtime systems feature just-in-time compilation to machine code.\n\nA modern aspect of runtime systems is parallel execution behaviors, such as the behaviors exhibited by mutex constructs in Pthreads and parallel section constructs in OpenMP. A runtime system with such parallel execution behaviors may be modularized according to the proto-runtime approach.\n\nNotable early examples of runtime systems are the interpreters for BASIC and Lisp. These environments also included a garbage collector. Forth is an early example of a language designed to be compiled into intermediate representation code; its runtime system was a virtual machine that interpreted that code. Another popular, if theoretical, example is Donald Knuth's MIX computer.\n\nIn C and later languages that supported dynamic memory allocation, the runtime system also included a library that managed the program's memory pool.\n\nIn the object-oriented programming languages, the runtime system was often also responsible for dynamic type checking and resolving method references.\n\n"}

It occurred on the night between 2-3 March 1944 in Balvano, Italy. Over 500 people in a steam-hauled, coal-burning freight train died of carbon monoxide poisoning during a protracted stall in a tunnel.\n\nIn 1943, Axis Italy was invaded by American and Imperial forces, and the south-part of the peninsula (almost fully conquered by Allied forces) suffered severe wartime shortages, encouraging an extensive black market. People in large cities like Naples began bartering fresh produce for commodities brought by servicemen, and stowed away on freight trains to reach their suppliers' farms.\n\nThe railway companies also suffered shortages of finest-quality coal. The burning of low-grade substitutes developed a reduced power output and produced a large volume of carbon monoxide, an odorless and poisonous gas, a particularly severe problem in Italy's railway network, which crosses mostly mountainous land, and hence makes large use of tunnels with steep inclines of up to 3.5%.\n\nAt 19:00 on 2 March 1944 the freight train 8017 started from Battipaglia heading to Potenza on the Battipaglia–Metaponto railway. The train, hauled by two locomotives (the 480.016 followed by the 476.058), had a mass of 520 tonnes and also carried many illegal passengers, making it grossly overloaded. In Eboli some passengers were forced off, but more boarded on following stops. At 00:50 the train left the station at Balvano, the last one before the disaster.\n\nOn the steeply graded Armi tunnel the train stalled with almost all the cars inside the tunnel, and the passengers and crew were asphyxiated by the carbon monoxideladen smoke, overcome so slowly that they failed to realize what was happening to them. Most died in their sleep. Of the few survivors most were in the last few cars, which were still in the open air. Rescuers later found that the driver of the 480.017 locomotive had tried to restart the train in the forward direction, while the driver of the 476.058 locomotive at some point tried to engage the reverse gear in attempt to exit the tunnel; the two drivers were unable to communicate because the 476 was an Austrian-built locomotive with right-hand drive, while the 480 had left-hand drive.\n\nAt 05:10 the Balvano station master learned of the disaster from last car's brakeman, who had walked back to the station. At 05:25 a locomotive reached the site but the many corpses on the track prevented it from removing the train from the tunnel; only some forty survivors in the last cars could be assisted. At 08:40 a second rescue team arrived. Among the crew, only the one brakeman, and the second locomotive's fireman, survived.\n\nDue to the large number of corpses, the wartime lack of resources, and the poverty of many of the victims, most of the dead were buried without religious service in four common graves at the Balvano cemetery.\n\nThe committee did not note any responsibility for the incident, which was considered as caused by force majeure. However, hypotheses were stated for some minor infractions: the train should not have received authorisation to start from Battipaglia even if the two locomotives were nominally sufficient for towing, as it was known that the coal supplied was not able to develop sufficient power to maintain the maximum performance of the machines, and the train should have been put in order with some new regulations.\n\nConcerns were raised about the timeliness of aid and the actions undertaken by the station masters of Balvano and Bella-Muro, who did not act to determine the location of the train when it appeared late on the roadmap. However, in the post-war confusion it was usual for communications to be irregular, and trains could be greatly delayed. It was not uncommon that it would take over two hours to travel the mountainous 7 km between the two stations.\n\nInitially it was also assumed that the drivers had not properly regulated sand boxes, which could prevent wheel spin.\n\nFinally, the catastrophe was attributed mainly to:\n\nIt was noted that the provisions for the composition of the train came straight from the Allied Command, and that in any case the train and station staff could not stop the train and modify it. The Command itself organized a train to check the condition of the disaster, with staff equipped with oxygen masks, which recognized the actual development of abnormal amounts of toxic gases.\nFerrovie dello Stato Italiane declined all responsibility, claiming that in the complex end-of-war set up (where Italian authorities coexisted with the US command) they could not even immediately determine who had the responsibility for the management of one particular train. However the company could be blamed because at that time, despite the high demand on the route between Naples and Potenza, there was only one scheduled passenger train (train 8021), which left from Naples twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, which prompted an increase in illegal ridership on freight trains.\n\nIn attempt to prevent criticism, the Ministry of Treasury paid compensation to the families of all identified victims as if they were war victims (although it was paid more than 15 years afterwards.)\n\nAfter the disaster a limit of 350 tonnes was introduced on the entire line. In addition, for particularly heavy trains requiring two locomotives, a composition of an American diesel locomotive and an Italian steam locomotive was used in place of a double steam drive. Furthermore, at the south exit of the Armi tunnel a permanent guard post was established, which allowed trains to enter the gallery only when exhaust gases from previous trains had cleared.\n\nThe guard post remained in place until 1959, when all steam trains were banned from the line. The weight regulations were repealed in 1996, when the line was electrified.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2106860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106860", "title": "Gary Holton", "text": "Gary Holton\n\nGary Frederick Holton (22 September 1953 – 25 October 1985) was an English singer-songwriter, musician and actor from London. He was the frontman of the band Heavy Metal Kids (1972–77), worked with Casino Steel (1981–84), and played the part of Wayne in the UK television comedy \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\" (1983–85). Holton died from an overdose of morphine combined with alcohol in 1985.\n\nGary Holton was born in Clapham, south London, the first child of Ernie and Joan Holton, and grew up in Kennington. Whilst musically talented, and a member of a rock band as a schoolboy at Beaufoy School, Lambeth, his real ambition was to act.\n\nEarly on in his life, Holton began working in the theatre world with the Sadler's Wells Opera Company, debuting in opera appearances aged eleven, and was with them for three years. In 1966 he had a part in Congreve's \"Love For Love\" with Laurence Olivier, and at fourteen played the title role in Menotti's \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\". Soon after leaving education at Westminster School, he joined the Old Vic Theatre Company, and from there he went on to work with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford.\n\nAt seventeen, he joined the touring company of \"Hair\", and remained with them for two years. When he left the company, his musical talents led him to front the rock band Heavy Metal Kids as vocalist.\n\nHolton made his screen acting debut in 1979, when he played the character of Eddie Hairstyle in the television movie \"The Knowledge\" with Michael Elphick and Kim Taylforth. Holton did not receive much credit for this role, nor for his role as an uncredited character in the film \"Quadrophenia\", released the same year. However, after appearing in the television series \"Shoestring\", Holton played the lead part of Ken in the 1979 film \"Bloody Kids\".\n\nIn 1980, he played the character of Keith in an episode of television series \"Play for Today\", and as a minor character in the film \"Breaking Glass\". He appeared as a minor character in the 1981 television film \"Tiny Revolutions\", and guest-starred as Rick Sloan in the television series \"The Gentle Touch\".\n\nHolton also sang the theme tune to 1980s British children's drama, \"Murphy's Mob\", which was produced by Central Television.\n\nPlaying the part of Wayne Winston Norris in the popular comedy drama \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\", Holton played a Cockney carpenter, nicknamed \"London\" by Oz. The character Norris liked his women, music and drink, which was similar to his off-screen personality.\n\nHe landed the part, the first of the seven main characters to be cast, after he was introduced to Ian La Frenais at a party. La Frenais and his writing partner Dick Clement had been drafting storylines and working on an idea given to them by Franc Roddam, who was the director of \"Quadrophenia\".\n\nThe first series of \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\" ran between 1983 and 1984. In February 1985, filming began on the second series. The final episode of the second series, broadcast after Holton's death, was dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe show was revived in 2002 with the original writers and all of the surviving cast members. The gap in the line-up left by Holton was filled by Wyman, Wayne's illegitimate son, played by Noel Clarke.\n\nWhile acting on \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\", Holton had only two other roles. He appeared in the TV series \"Minder\", in which he played villain Barry, in 1984. He also played an uncredited extra in the television series \"Bulman\" the following year. He also appeared in an episode of \"Shoestring\" filmed in Bristol.\n\nHolton was offered the role of villain 'Nasty' Nick Cotton in the television soap opera \"EastEnders\", but he turned down the role and it was instead given to Holton's friend John Altman, who bore a strong resemblance to him, and would go on to succeed him as the lead singer of the Heavy Metal Kids.\n\nHis musical endeavours were confined to strict one-offs for a while: in December 1978, Holton stood in for The Damned vocalist Dave Vanian on a short Scottish tour; and he also recorded a solo single (which became a number one hit in Norway), a punk-country version of Kenny Rogers's \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\" with the Boys' keyboardist Casino Steel, with whom he would later write a song simply titled \"Auf Wiedersehen Pet\" about his experiences in the show. Holton and Steel recorded three albums together, all of them doing well in Norway. But even the opportunity to replace the late Bon Scott in AC/DC could not lure him back to full-time rock & roll. He made an appearance on the TV programme The Tube in 1984 with a band named as The Actors, which included fellow Quadrophenia star Gary Shail on bass guitar, and they performed a song entitled \"Long-Legged Blue-Eyed Blonde\".\n\nGary was the front-man for the band, which formed in 1972. With his cockney accent, he became a popular glam rock singer. The band were discovered by former Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich front-man Dave Dee, who signed them to Atlantic Records. Their eponymous debut album was well received by the press, but had achieved limited sales. They later played many gigs with punk rock band the Adverts. On their first American tour in 1975, they shortened their name to \"The Kids\".\n\nIn December 1975, the Kids signed with producer Mickie Most's RAK label, but before work could begin on their next album, Holton was sacked amid a storm of drink- and drug-related headlines. Plans for the remaining members to continue on without him came to naught. In late 1977, Holton rejoined the band for a handful of live shows and the long-delayed third album, \"Kitsch\". But, by mid-1978, he had departed once again, and the band broke up.\n\nWhilst the band was popular in Sweden, they had little commercial success in Britain although in 1976 their single \"She's No Angel\" was regularly played on BBC Radio 1, a favourite of DJ John Peel, and this led to an appearance on \"Top of the Pops\". The lack of commercial success led to the breakup of the band, and Holton returned to acting.\n\nIn 1980/81, Holton hooked up with Casino Steel, a musician from Norway and in the following years released a couple of (in Norway) bestselling albums. The duo's musical style was country rock with strong punk influences, their first hit being a cover of Kenny Rogers' \"Ruby\". Gary Holton's Norwegian musical career went largely unnoticed in his homeland.\n\nHolton had a string of relationships in the early to mid 1970s. In 1977, he dated singer Stella Palmer, with whom he performed his cover version of \"Somethin' Stupid\" in 1973. Holton and Palmer got engaged on 12 March 1977, but on 2 May the same year, Palmer called off the engagement, stating their relationship was not going quite as planned.\n\nFrom 1979 he was married to model Donna Campbell. They were amicably separated from 1981 and remained friends, though they were still not divorced at the time of his death.\n\nAfter Donna, Holton had a relationship with model Susan Harrison who gave birth to his son Red, in 1983.\n\nAt the time of his death, Holton had long separated from Harrison and was engaged to hairdresser Jahnet Mclllewan.\n\nHolton was found dead by his fiancée in his bed on 25 October 1985. He had died from an overdose of alcohol and morphine, with traces of diazepam and cannabis in his system. Pathologist Rufus Crompton said during his inquest at Hornsey, North London, that he would have been drinking less than half an hour before his death, and that the morphine would have made him unconscious within a matter of minutes.\n\nHolton had a blood alcohol level of 199 mg and a morphine level of 0.8 mg per litre (0.5 mg per litre is considered invariably fatal). He had been a drug user for several years after experiences through the music scene and was addicted to heroin, a habit he had quit some time after the first series of \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\" had been broadcast. He was considering setting up a clinic to help others with their addictions.\n\nHolton had considerable debts and had two bankruptcy orders totalling £61,000 over him. These debts were partly due to his not having paid tax since 1979, and also having a mortgage of £48,500 on his flat in Maida Vale, London.\n\nHe died midway through the second series of \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\", but the producers used body doubles and editing of dialogue already recorded to allow the series to be completed. They eventually rescripted the series, such that in every indoor scene that originally included Holton, excuses were made for his absence.\n\nJust before his death, he had released the single \"Catch A Falling Star\". He was survived by his two sons, Red, and Max, with model Susan Harrison.\n\nHolton's funeral took place on 22 November 1985, with a 15-minute service at Golders Green Crematorium in London. His \"Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\" co-stars attended. His ashes were placed in his grandparents' grave in Maesgwastad Cemetery, Welshpool, Wales.\n\nWith Heavy Metal Kids\n\n\nWith Casino Steel\n\nSolo\n\nWith Heavy Metal Kids\n\nWith Casino Steel\n\nSolo\n\n"}

{"id": "2106862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106862", "title": "Bezalel", "text": "Bezalel\n\nIn Exodus 31:1-6 and chapters 36 to 39, Bezalel, Bezaleel, or Betzalel (, \"Bəṣalʼēl\"), was the chief artisan of the Tabernacle and was in charge of building the Ark of the Covenant, assisted by Aholiab. The section in chapter 31 describes his selection as chief artisan, in the context of Moses' vision of how God wanted the tabernacle to be constructed, and chapters 36 to 39 recount the construction process undertaken by Bezalel, Aholiab and every gifted artisan and willing worker, in accordance with the vision.\n\nElsewhere in the Bible the name occurs only in the genealogical lists of the Book of Chronicles, but according to cuneiform inscriptions a variant form of the same, \"Ṣil-Bēl,\" was borne by a king of Gaza who was a contemporary of Hezekiah and Manasseh.\n\nThe name \"Bezalel\" means \"in the shadow [protection] of God.\" Bezalel is described in the genealogical lists as the son of Uri (Exodus 31:1), the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah (I Chronicles 2:18, 19, 20, 50). He was said to be highly gifted as a workman, showing great skill and originality in engraving precious metals and stones and in wood-carving. He was also a master-workman, having many apprentices under him whom he instructed in the arts (Exodus 35:30–35). According to the narrative in Exodus, he was called and endowed by God to direct the construction of the tent of meeting and its sacred furniture, and also to prepare the priests' garments and the oil and incense required for the service.\n\nHe was also in charge of the holy oils, incense, and priestly vestments. Caleb was his great-grandfather.\n\nThe rabbinical tradition relates that when God determined to appoint Bezalel architect of the desert Tabernacle, He asked Moses whether the choice were agreeable to him, and received the reply: \"Lord, if he is acceptable to Thee, surely he must be so to me!\" At God's command, however, the choice was referred to the people for approval and was endorsed by them. Moses thereupon commanded Bezalel to set about making the Tabernacle, the holy Ark, and the sacred utensils. It is to be noted, however, that Moses mentioned these in somewhat inverted order, putting the Tabernacle last (compare Exodus 25:10, 26:1 et seq., with Exodus 31:1–10). Bezalel sagely suggested to him that men usually build the house first and afterward provide the furnishings; but that, inasmuch as Moses had ordered the Tabernacle to be built last, there was probably some mistake and God's command must have run differently. Compare also Philo, \"Leg. Alleg.\"\n\nBezalel possessed such great wisdom that he could combine those letters of the alphabet with which heaven and earth were created; this being the meaning of the statement (Exodus 31:3): \"I have filled him ... with wisdom and knowledge,\" which were the implements by means of which God created the world, as stated in Proverbs 3:19, 20 (Berakhot 55a). By virtue of his profound wisdom, Bezalel succeeded in erecting a sanctuary which seemed a fit abiding-place for God, who is so exalted in time and space (Exodus R. 34:1; Numbers R. 12:3; Midrash Teh. 91). The candlestick of the sanctuary was of so complicated a nature that Moses could not comprehend it, although God twice showed him a heavenly model; but when he described it to Bezalel, the latter understood immediately, and made it at once; whereupon Moses expressed his admiration for the quick wisdom of Bezalel, saying again that he must have been \"in the shadow of God\" (Hebrew, \"beẓel El\") when the heavenly models were shown him (Numbers R. 15:10; compare Exodus R. 1. 2; Berakhot l.c.). Bezalel is said to have been only thirteen years of age when he accomplished his great work (Sanhedrin 69b); he owed his wisdom to the merits of pious parents; his grandfather being Hur and his great-grandmother Miriam, he was thus a grandnephew of Moses (Exodus R. 48:3, 4).\n\nThe Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design and the Bezalel School art movement in Israel are both named after him.\n\n"}

The intention was to create 'a powerful international organisation, which would extend its ramifications to the remotest corner of the globe'. \n\nThe movement was granted the patronage of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Council included two prominent members of that body, including its Head of Secretariat, Etienne Clouzot. It brought together organisations from various countries that were initially working to tackle child suffering around Europe after World War I.\n\nIn 1923, it agreed, and then lobbied for, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child which was adopted by the League of Nations in the following year.\n\nIn 1946, it merged with the International Association for the Promotion of Child Welfare (founded 1921 in Brussels) to form the International Union for Child Welfare (French: \"Union internationale de protection de l'enfance\").\n\nIn 1977, a number of Save the Children organisations formed the International Save the Children Alliance to coordinate their international advocacy work.\n\nIn 1986, the General Council of the International Union for Child Welfare voted to disband the organisation, allegedly for reasons of financial mismanagement.

{"id": "2106865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106865", "title": "Morton Sobell", "text": "Morton Sobell\n\nMorton Sobell (April 11, 1917 – December 26, 2018) was an American engineer who is known for having been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union when it was an ally of the United States during late World War II; he was charged as part of a conspiracy said to include Julius Rosenberg and his wife, and others. Sobell worked on military and government contracts with General Electric and Reeves Electronics in the 1940s, including during World War II. Sobell was tried and convicted of espionage in 1951 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. \n\nHe was released in 1969 after serving 17 years and 9 months in prison. After that he became an advocate of progressive causes, conducting public speaking and traveling to Vietnam during the war, to East Germany before the fall of the Soviet Union, and to Cuba. \n\nMorton Sobell was born in New York City to Jewish immigrant parents Louis and Rose Sobel, who came in 1906 from the small village of Belozerka, Russian Empire (today in Ukraine). He attended public schools and Stuyvesant High School. He graduated from the City College of New York where he received a degree in engineering. \n\nSobell began work in 1939 in Washington, D.C., for the Navy Bureau of Ordnance. In 1943 he took a job with General Electric Company, which had major defense contracts, in Schenectady, New York.\n\nAccording to NKGB agent Alexander Feklisov, Sobell was recruited as a spy in the summer of 1944, during World War II when the Soviet Union had become an ally of the United States. \"Sobell... was deferred from active military service because he was a top specialist in his field... When I asked him if he could microfilm his own documents, he replied it was not a problem since he knew photography quite well. At our next meeting I brought him a camera with the necessary accessories and a small stock of film.\"\n\nIn June 1944, Max Elitcher claimed he was phoned by Julius Rosenberg, whom he had known slightly at college and had not seen in six years. Elitcher later recalled: \"I remembered the name, I recalled who it was, and he said he would like to see me. He came over after supper, and my wife was there and we had a casual conversation. After that he asked if my wife would leave the room, that he wanted to speak to me in private.\" Rosenberg allegedly said that many people were aiding the Soviet Union \"by providing classified information about military equipment\". Rosenberg said that Morton Sobell was \"also helping in this\".\n\nAt the beginning of September 1944, Elitcher and his wife went on holiday with Sobell and his fiancée Helen Levitov. Elitcher told his friend of Rosenberg's visit and his disclosure that \"you, Sobell, were also helping in this.\" According to Elitcher, Sobell became very angry and said \"he should not have mentioned my name. He should not have told you that.\" Elitcher claimed that Rosenberg tried to recruit him again in September 1945. Rosenberg told Elitcher \"that even though the war was over there was a continuing need for new military information for Russia.\"\n\nIn 1945 Sobell married Helen Levitov (1918–2002), who brought her daughter Sydney Gurewitz, born during her previous marriage. The new couple soon had a son Mark together.\n\nAfter David Greenglass, Ethel Rosenberg's brother, was arrested on charges of espionage, Sobell and his family fled to Mexico on June 22, 1950. He fled with his wife Helen, infant son Mark Sobell, and Helen's daughter Sydney from her previous marriage. They lived under assumed names. Sobell tried to travel to Europe, but without proper papers he was not able to leave. On August 16, 1950, Sobell and his family were abducted by armed men, taken to the United States border and turned over to the FBI. The FBI arrested him for conspiring with Julius Rosenberg to violate espionage laws. \n\nThere were many questions raised by progressive intellectuals about the Rosenberg and Sobell cases. He was tried and found guilty along with the Rosenbergs, and sentenced to 30 years. Both the Rosenbergs were executed. His wife Helen Sobell had worked with others to have the Rosenbergs spared from execution. She continued to work for more than 15 years to gain her husband's freedom. She contributed to eight appeals of his conviction on the merits, but these were unsuccessful. During this time, she taught science at the private Elizabeth Irwin School, a private high school in Greenwich Village. Sobell was initially sent to Alcatraz, but was transferred to another Lewisburg Penitentiary when that prison closed in 1963. \n\nSobell was released in 1969 after serving 17 years and 9 months. It was seven and a half months before he was eligible for parole because the Circuit Court of Appeals gave him credit for the time he was in jail after his arrest and before his trial. His bail had been set at $100,000, which he could not raise. \n\nSobell turned 100 in April 2017.\n\nSobell's purported innocence became a cause among progressive intellectuals, who organized a Committee to Secure Justice for Morton Sobell. In 1978 the Corporation for Public Broadcasting produced a television special that maintained Sobell was innocent of the government charges. The \"Monthly Review\" maintained that the government had presented \"absolutely no proof\" of Sobell's guilt, but had tried him merely \"to give the impression that an extensive spy ring had been in operation.\"\n\nIn 1974, Sobell published a memoir, On Doing Time\", in which he maintained that he was innocent and that his conviction was a case of justice being subverted to serve political goals. After his release from prison, Sobell went on the speaker circuit, regaling audiences with his account of being falsely prosecuted and convicted by the federal government.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of \"The Nation\" in 2001, Sobell referred to himself as a \"bona fide convicted spy\".\n\nIn September 2008, the National Archives released most of the grand jury testimony from the prosecution of the conspiracy case against the Rosenbergs and Sobell, in response to a suit by the National Security Archive, historians and journalists.\n\nSobell, then 91, was interviewed at the time about the case, as he was the only surviving primary figure. For the first time, he told \"The New York Times\" that he had given military secrets to the Soviets during World War II when it was an ally of the United States and bearing the brunt of German attacks. He made the distinction that he had passed only material about defensive radar and artillery devices. This was the first time he had acknowledged these actions. Reporter Sam Roberts said that military experts contended that one device Sobell mentioned in the interview was used later against US military aircraft during the Korean and Vietnam wars. By that time the Cold War was long underway and the Soviet Union was considered an enemy of the US. Sobell also said that his co-defendant Julius Rosenberg had been involved in spying, but his wife was not.\n\nLike the Rosenbergs, at the time of the events for which he was tried, Sobell was a committed communist. In 2018 he told the \"Wall Street Journal\", \"I bet on the wrong horse.\"\n\nIn 1945, Sobell married Helen Levitov. She brought her daughter, Sydney Gurewitz, from her first marriage, and the couple had a son Mark together. They divorced in 1980. Helen Sobell died in 2002.\n\nIn 1990, Sobell met Nancy Gruber. They married in 1993 and he survived her death in 2018. They lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Sobell died at the age of 101 on December 26, 2018. He was the last-surviving member of the Rosenberg spy ring.\n\n\n\n"}

In mainstream Christianity, there is a similar idea that faith is the only means by which a true understanding of God can be gained. The term \"esoteric\" was coined in the 17th century and derives from the Greek ἐσωτερικός (esôterikos, \"inner\").\nThese spiritual currents share some common denominators, such as heterodox or heretical Christian theology; the canonical gospels, various apocalyptic literature, and some New Testament apocrypha as sacred texts; and \"disciplina arcani\", a supposed oral tradition from the Twelve Apostles containing esoteric teachings of Jesus the Christ.\n\nThe word \"mysticism\" is derived from the Greek μυω, meaning \"to conceal\", and its derivative , \"mystikos\", meaning 'an initiate'. In the Hellenistic world, 'mystical' referred to \"secret\" religious rituals. The use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental. A \"mystikos\" was an initiate of a mystery religion.\n\nTheologians give the name \"mystery\" to revealed truths that surpass the powers of natural reason, so, in a narrow sense, the Mystery is a truth that transcends the created intellect.\n\nSome modern scholars believe that in the early stages of non-Gnostic Christianity, a nucleus of oral teachings were inherited from Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism. In the 4th century, it was believed to form the basis of a secret oral tradition which came to be called \"disciplina arcani\". The mainstream theologians, however, believe that it contained only liturgical details and certain other traditions which remain a part of some branches of mainstream Christianity. Important influences on Esoteric Christianity are the Christian theologians Clement of Alexandria and Origen, the leading figures of the Catechetical School of Alexandria.\n\nReincarnation was accepted by most of Gnostic Christian sects such as Valentinianism and Basilidians, but denied by the proto-orthodox one. While hypothetically considering a complex multiple-world transmigration scheme in \"De Principiis\", Origen denies reincarnation in unmistakable terms in his work \"Against Celsus\" and elsewhere. \n\nDespite this apparent contradiction, most modern Esoteric Christian movements refer to Origen's writings (along with other Church Fathers and biblical passages) to validate these ideas as part of the Esoteric Christian tradition outside of the Gnostic schools, who were later considered heretical in the 3rd century.\n\nScholar Jan Shipps describes The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as having esoteric elements.\n\n\n"}

During the post-classical era, Islamic medicine was the most advanced in the world, integrating concepts of ancient Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian and Persian medicine as well as the ancient Indian tradition of Ayurveda, while making numerous advances and innovations. Islamic medicine, along with knowledge of classical medicine, was later adopted in the medieval medicine of Western Europe, after European physicians became familiar with Islamic medical authors during the Renaissance of the 12th century.\n\nMedieval Islamic physicians largely retained their authority until the rise of medicine as a part of the natural sciences, beginning with the Age of Enlightenment, nearly six hundred years after their textbooks were opened by many people. Aspects of their writings remain of interest to physicians even today.\n\nMedicine was a central part of medieval Islamic culture. Responding to circumstances of time and place/location, Islamic physicians and scholars developed a large and complex medical literature exploring, analyzing, and synthesizing the theory and practice of medicine Islamic medicine was initially built on tradition, chiefly the theoretical and practical knowledge developed in Arabia and was known at Muhammad's time, ancient Hellenistic medicine such as Unani, ancient Indian medicine such as Ayurveda, and the ancient Iranian Medicine of the Academy of Gundishapur. The works of ancient Greek and Roman physicians Hippocrates, Galen and Dioscorides also had a lasting impact on Islamic medicine. Ophthalmology has been described as the most successful branch of medicine researched at the time, with the works of Ibn al-Haytham remaining an authority in the field until early modern times.\n\nThe adoption by the newly forming Islamic society of the medical knowledge of the surrounding, or newly conquered, \"heathen\" civilizations had to be justified as being in accordance with the beliefs of Islam. Early on, the study and practice of medicine was understood as an act of piety, founded on the principles of \"Imaan\" (faith) and \"Tawakkul\" (trust).\n\nMuhammad's opinions on health issues and habits with rojo leading a healthy life were collected early on and edited as a separate corpus of writings under the title \"Ṭibb an-Nabī\" (\"The Medicine of the Prophet\"). In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun, in his work \"Muqaddimah\" provides a brief overview over what he called \"the art and craft of medicine\", separating the science of medicine from religion:\n\nThe Sahih al-Bukhari, a collection of prophetic traditions, or \"hadith\" by Muhammad al-Bukhari refers to a collection of Muhammad's opinions on medicine, by his younger contemporary Anas bin-Malik. Anas writes about two physicians who had treated him by cauterization and mentions that the prophet wanted to avoid this treatment and had asked for alternative treatments. Later on, there are reports of the caliph ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān fixing his teeth with a wire made of gold. He also mentions that the habit of cleaning one's teeth with a small wooden toothpick dates back to pre-Islamic times.\n\nThe \"Prophetic medicine\" was rarely mentioned by the classical authors of Islamic medicine, but lived on in the materia medica for some centuries. In his \"Kitab as-Ṣaidana\" (Book of Remedies) from the 10./11. century, Al-Biruni refers to collected poems and other works dealing with, and commenting on, the materia medica of the old Arabs.\n\nThe most famous physician was Al-Ḥariṯ ben-Kalada aṯ-Ṯaqafī, who lived at the same time as the prophet. He is supposed to have been in touch with the Academy of Gondishapur, perhaps he was even trained there. He reportedly had a conversation once with Khosrow I Anushirvan about medical topics.\n\nMost likely, the Arabian physicians became familiar with the Graeco-Roman and late Hellenistic medicine through direct contact with physicians who were practicing in the newly conquered regions rather than by reading the original or translated works. The translation of the capital of the emerging Islamic world to Damascus may have facilitated this contact, as Syrian medicine was part of that ancient tradition. The names of two Christian physicians are known: Ibn Aṯāl worked at the court of Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. The caliph abused his knowledge in order to get rid of some of his enemies by way of poisoning. Likewise, Abu l-Ḥakam, who was responsible for the preparation of drugs, was employed by Muawiah. His son, grandson, and great-grandson were also serving the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphate.\n\nThese sources testify to the fact that the physicians of the emerging islamic society were familiar with the classical medical traditions already at the times of the Umayyads. The medical knowledge likely arrived from Alexandria, and was probably transferred by Syrian scholars, or translators, finding its way into the Islamic world.\n\nVery few sources provide information about how the expanding Islamic society received any medical knowledge. A physician called Abdalmalik ben Abgar al-Kinānī from Kufa in Iraq is supposed to have worked at the medical school of Alexandria before he joined ʿUmar ibn ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz's court. ʿUmar transferred the medical school from Alexandria to Antioch. It is also known that members of the Academy of Gondishapur travelled to Damascus. The Academy of Gondishapur remained active throughout the time of the Abbasid caliphate, though.\n\nAn important source from the second half of the 8th century is Jabir ibn Hayyans \"Book of Poisons\". He only cites earlier works in Arabic translations, as were available to him, including Hippocrates, Plato, Galen, Pythagoras, and Aristotle, and also mentions the Persian names of some drugs and medical plants.\n\nIn 825, the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun founded the House of Wisdom (; \"Bayt al-Hikma\") in Baghdad, modelled after the Academy of Gondishapur. Led by the Christian physician Hunayn ibn Ishaq, and with support by Byzance, all available works from the antique world were translated, including Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy and Archimedes.\n\nIt is currently understood that the early Islamic medicine was mainly informed directly from Greek sources from the Academy of Alexandria, translated into the Arabic language; the influence of the Persian medical tradition seems to be limited to the materia medica, although the Persian physicians were familiar with the Greek sources as well.\n\nVarious translations of some works and compilations of ancient medical texts are known from the 7th century. Hunayn ibn Ishaq, the leader of a team of translators at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad played a key role with regard to the translation of the entire known corpus of classical medical literature. Caliph Al-Ma'mun had sent envoys to the Byzantine emperor Theophilos, asking him to provide whatever classical texts he had available. Thus, the great medical texts of Hippocrates and Galen were translated into Arabian, as well as works of Pythagoras, Akron of Agrigent, Democritus, Polybos, Diogenes of Apollonia, medical works attributed to Plato, Aristotle, Mnesitheus of Athens, Xenocrates, Pedanius Dioscorides, Kriton, Soranus of Ephesus, Archigenes, Antyllus, Rufus of Ephesus were translated from the original texts, other works including those of Erasistratos were known by their citations in Galens works.\n\nThe works of Oribasius, physician to the Roman emperor Julian, from the 4th century AD, were well known, and were frequently cited in detail by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Rhazes). The works of Philagrius of Epirus, who also lived in the 4th century AD, are only known today from quotations by Arabic authors. The philosopher and physician John the Grammarian, who lived in the 6th century AD was attributed the role of a commentator on the \"Summaria Alexandrinorum\". This is a compilation of 16 books by Galen, but corrupted by superstitious ideas. The physicians Gessios of Petra and Palladios were equally known to the Arabic physicians as authors of the \"Summaria\". Rhazes cites the Roman physician Alexander of Tralles (6th century) in order to support his criticism of Galen. The works of Aëtius of Amida were only known in later times, as they were neither cited by Rhazes nor by Ibn al-Nadim, but cited first by Al-Biruni in his \"Kitab as-Saidana\", and translated by Ibn al-Hammar in the 10th century.\n\nOne of the very first books which were translated from Greek into Syrian, and then into Arabic during the time of the fourth Umayyad caliph Marwan I by the Jewish scholar Māsarĝawai al-Basrĩ was the medical compilation \"Kunnāš\", by Ahron, who lived during the 6th century. Later on, Hunayn ibn Ishaq provided a better translation.\n\nThe physician Paul of Aegina lived in Alexandria during the time of the Arab expansion. His works seem to have been used as an important reference by the early islamic physicians, and were frequently cited from Rhazes up to Avicenna. Paul of Aegina provides a direct connection between the late Hellenistic and the early islamic medical science.\n\nThe early islamic physicians were familiar with the life of Hippocrates, and were aware of the fact that his biography was in part a legend. Also they knew that several persons lived who were called Hippocrates, and their works were compiled under one single name: Ibn an-Nadīm has conveyed a short treatise by Tabit ben-Qurra on \"al-Buqratun\" (\"the (various persons called) Hippokrates\"). Translations of some of Hippocrates's works must have existed before Hunayn ibn Ishaq started his translations, because the historian Al-Yaʾqūbī compiled a list of the works known to him in 872. Fortunately, his list also supplies a summary of the content, quotations, or even the entire text of the single works. The philosopher Al-Kindi wrote a book with the title \"at-Tibb al-Buqrati\" (The Medicine of Hippocrates), and his contemporary Hunayn ibn Ishāq then translated Galens commentary on Hippocrates. Rhazes is the first Arabic-writing physician who makes thorough use of Hippocrates's writings in order to set up his own medical system. Al-Tabari maintained that his compilation of hippocratic teachings (\"al-Muʾālaḡāt al-buqrāṭīya\") was a more appropriate summary. The work of Hippocrates was cited and commented on during the entire period of medieval islamic medicine.\n\nGalen is one of the most famous scholars and physicians of classical antiquity. Today, the original texts of some of his works, and details of his biography, are lost, and are only known to us because they were translated into Arabic. Jabir ibn Hayyan frequently cites Galen's books, which were available in early Arabic translations. In 872 AD, Ya'qubi refers to some of Galens works. The titles of the books he mentions differ from those chosen by Hunayn ibn Ishāq for his own translations, thus suggesting earlier translations must have existed. Hunayn frequently mentions in his comments on works which he had translated that he considered earlier translations as insufficient, and had provided completely new translations. Early translations might have been available before the 8th century; most likely they were translated from Syrian or Persian.\n\nWithin medieval islamic medicine, Hunayn ibn Ishāq and his younger contemporary Tabit ben-Qurra play an important role as translators and commentators of Galen's work. They also tried to compile and summarize a consistent medical system from these works, and add this to the medical science of their period. However, starting already with Jabir ibn Hayyan in the 8th century, and even more pronounced in Rhazes's treatise on vision, criticism of Galen's ideas took on. in the 10th century, the physician 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi wrote:\n\nDuring the 10th century, Ibn Wahshiyya compiled writings by the Nabataeans, including also medical information. The Syrian scholar Sergius of Reshaina translated various works by Hippocrates and Galen, of whom parts 6–8 of a pharmacological book, and fragments of two other books have been preserved. Hunayn ibn Ishāq has translated these works into Arabic. Another work, still existing today, by an unknown Syrian author, likely has influenced the Arabic-writing physicians Al-Tabari and Yūhannā ibn Māsawaiyh.\n\nThe earliest known translation from the Syrian language is the \"Kunnāš\" of the scholar Ahron (who himself had translated it from the Greek), which was translated into the Arabian by Māsarĝawai al-Basrĩ in the 7th century. [Syriac-language, not Syrian, who were Nestorians] physicians also played an important role at the Academy of Gondishapur; their names were preserved because they worked at the court of the Abbasid caliphs.\n\nAgain the Academy of Gondishapur played an important role, guiding the transmission of Persian medical knowledge to the Arabic physicians. Founded, according to Gregorius Bar-Hebraeus, by the Sassanid ruler Shapur I during the 3rd century AD, the academy connected the ancient Greek and Indian medical traditions. Arabian physicians trained in Gondishapur may have established contacts with early Islamic medicine. The treatise \"Abdāl al-adwiya\" by the Christian physician Māsarĝawai (not to be confused with the translator M. al-Basrĩ) is of some importance, as the opening sentence of his work is:\n\nIn his work \"Firdaus al-Hikma\" (The Paradise of Wisdom), Al-Tabari uses only a few Persian medical terms, especially when mentioning specific diseases, but a large number of drugs and medicinal herbs are mentioned using their Persian names, which have also entered the medical language of Islamic medicine. As well as al-Tabari, Rhazes rarely uses Persian terms, and only refers to two Persian works: \"Kunnāš fārisi\" und \"al-Filāha al-fārisiya\".\n\nIndian scientific works, e.g. on Astronomy were already translated by Yaʿqūb ibn Ṭāriq and Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Fazārī during the times of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur. Under Harun al-Rashid, at latest, the first translations were performed of Indian works about medicine and pharmacology. In one chapter on Indian medicine, Ibn al-Nadim mentions the names of three of the translators: Mankah, Ibn Dahn, and ʾAbdallah ibn ʾAlī. Yūhannā ibn Māsawaiyh cites an Indian textbook in his treatise on ophthalmology.\n\nat-Tabarī devotes the last 36 chapters of his \"Firdaus al-Hikmah\" to describe the Indian medicine, citing Sushruta, Charaka, and the \"Ashtanga Hridaya\" (Sanskrit: अष्टांग हृदय, ; \"The eightfold Heart\"), one of the most important books on Ayurveda, translated between 773 and 808 by Ibn-Dhan. Rhazes cites in \"al-Hawi\" and in \"Kitab al-Mansuri\" both Sushruta and Charaka besides other authors unknown to him by name, whose works he cites as '\"'min kitab al-Hind\"\", „an Indian book\".\n\nMeyerhof suggested that the Indian medicine, like the Persian medicine, has mainly influenced the Arabic \"materia medica\", because there is frequent reference to Indian names of herbal medicines and drugs, which were unknown to the Greek medical tradition. Whilst Syrian physicians transmitted the medical knowledge of the ancient Greeks, most likely Persian physicians, probably from the Academy of Gondishapur, were the first intermediates between the Indian and the Arabic medicine\n\nThe authority of the great physicians and scientists of the Islamic Golden age has influenced the art and science of medicine for many centuries. Their concepts and ideas about medical ethics are still discussed today, especially in the Islamic parts of our world. Their ideas about the conduct of physicians, and the doctor–patient relationship are discussed as potential role models for physicians of today.\n\nAli ibn Mousa al-Ridha (765–818) was the eighth Imam of shia. His treatise \"Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah\" (\"The Golden Treatise\") deals with medical cures and the maintenance of good health, and is dedicated to the caliph Ma'mun. It was regarded at his time as an important work of literature in the science of medicine, and the most precious medical treatise from the point of view of Muslimic religious tradition. It is honoured by the title \"the golden treatise\" as Ma'mun had ordered it to be written in gold ink. In his work, Al-Ridha is influenced by the concept of humoral medicine\n\nThe first encyclopedia of medicine in Arabic language was by Persian scientist Ali ibn Sahl Rabban al-Tabari's \"Firdous al-Hikmah\" (\"\"Paradise of Wisdom\"\"), written in seven parts, c. 860. Al-Tabari, a pioneer in the field of child development, emphasized strong ties between psychology and medicine, and the need for psychotherapy and counseling in the therapeutic treatment of patients. His encyclopedia also discussed the influence of Sushruta and Charaka on medicine, including psychotherapy.\n\nAl-Tamimi, the physician (d. 990) became renown for his skills in compounding medicines, especially theriac, an antidote for poisons. His works, many of which no longer survive, are cited by later physicians. Taking what was known at the time by the classical Greek writers, Al-Tamimi expanded on their knowledge of the properties of plants and minerals, becoming \"avant garde\" in his field.\n\n'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi (died 994 AD), also known as Haly Abbas, was famous for the Kitab al-Maliki translated as the \"Complete Book of the Medical Art\" and later, more famously known as \"The Royal Book\". This book was translated by Constantine and was used as a textbook of surgery in schools across Europe. One of the greatest contributions Haly Abbas made to medical science was his description of the capillary circulation found within the Royal Book.\n\nMuhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Latinized: Rhazes) was one of the most versatile scientists of the Islamic Golden Age. A Persian-born physician, alchemist and philosopher, he is most famous for his medical works, but he also wrote botanical and zoological works, as well as books on physics and mathematics. His work was highly respected by the 10th/11th century physicians and scientists al-Biruni and al-Nadim, who recorded biographical information about al-Razi, and compiled lists of, and provided commentaries on, his writings. Many of his books were translated into Latin, and he remained one of the undisputed authorities in European medicine well into the 17th century.\n\nIn medical theory, al-Razi relied mainly on Galen, but his particular attention to the individual case, stressing that each patient must be treated individually, and his emphasis on hygiene and diet reflect the ideas and concepts of the empirical hippocratic school. Rhazes considered the influence of the climate and the season on health and well-being, he took care that there was always clean air and an appropriate temperature in the patients' rooms, and recognized the value of prevention as well as the need for a careful diagnosis and prognosis.\n\nThe \"kitab-al Hawi fi al-tibb\" (\"al-Hawi\" \"الحاوي\", Latinized: \"The Comprehensive book of medicine\", \"Continens Liber\", \"The Virtuous Life\") was one of al-Razi's largest works, a collection of medical notes that he made throughout his life in the form of extracts from his reading and observations from his own medical experience. \nIn its published form, it consists of 23 volumes. Al-Razi cites Greek, Syrian, Indian and earlier Arabic works, and also includes medical cases from his own experience. Each volume deals with specific parts or diseases of the body. 'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi reviewed the \"al-Hawi\" in his own book \"Kamil as-sina'a\":\n\"Al-Hawi\" remained an authoritative textbook on medicine in most European universities, regarded until the seventeenth century as the most comprehensive work ever written by a medical scientist. It was first translated into Latin in 1279 by Faraj ben Salim, a physician of Sicilian-Jewish origin employed by Charles of Anjou.\n\nThe \"al-Kitab al-Mansuri\" (الكتاب المنصوري في الطب, Latinized: \"Liber almansoris\", \"Liber medicinalis ad Almansorem\") was dedicated to \"the Samanid prince Abu Salih al-Mansur ibn Ishaq, governor of Rayy.\"\nThe book contains a comprehensive encyclopedia of medicine in ten sections. The first six sections are dedicated to medical theory, and deal with anatomy, physiology and pathology, materia medica, health issues, dietetics, and cosmetics. The remaining four parts describe surgery, toxicology, and fever. The ninth section, a detailed discussion of medical pathologies arranged by body parts, circulated in autonomous Latin translations as the \"Liber Nonus\".\n\n'Ali ibn al-'Abbas al-Majusi comments on the \"al-Mansuri\" in his book \"Kamil as-sina'a\":\n\nThe book was first translated into Latin in 1175 by Gerard of Cremona. Under various titles (\"Liber (medicinalis) ad Almansorem\"; \"Almansorius\"; \"Liber ad Almansorem\"; \"Liber nonus\") it was printed in Venice in 1490, 1493, and 1497. Amongst the many European commentators on the Liber nonus, Andreas Vesalius paraphrased al-Razi's work in his \"\"Paraphrases in nonum librum Rhazae\"\", which was first published in Louvain, 1537.\n\nAnother work of al-Razi is called the \"Kitab Tibb al-Muluki\" (\"Regius\"). This book covers the treatments and cures of diseases and ailments, through dieting. It is thought to have been written for the noble class who were known for their gluttonous behavior and who frequently became ill with stomach diseases.\n\nUntil the discovery of Tabit ibn Qurras earlier work, al-Razi's treatise on smallpox and measles was considered the earliest monograph on these infectious diseases. His careful description of the initial symptoms and clinical course of the two diseases, as well as the treatments he suggests based on the observation of the symptoms, is considered a masterpiece of Islamic medicine.\n\nOther works include \"A Dissertation on the causes of the Coryza which occurs in the spring when roses give forth their scent\", a tract in which al-Razi discussed why it is that one contracts coryza or common cold by smelling roses during the spring season, and \"Bur’al Sa’a\" (\"Instant cure\") in which he named medicines which instantly cured certain diseases.\n\n\"Ibn Sina\", more commonly known in west as Avicenna was a Persian polymath and physician of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He was known for his scientific works, but especially his writing on medicine. He has been described as the \"Father of Early Modern Medicine\". Ibn Sina is credited with many varied medical observations and discoveries, such as recognizing the potential of airborne transmission of disease, providing insight into many psychiatric conditions, recommending use of forceps in deliveries complicated by fetal distress, distinguishing central from peripheral facial paralysis and describing guinea worm infection and trigeminal neuralgia. He is credited for writing two books in particular: his most famous, \"al-Canon fi al Tibb\" (\"The Canon of Medicine\"), and also \"The Book of Healing\". His other works cover subjects including angelology, heart medicines, and treatment of kidney diseases.\n\nAvicenna's medicine became the representative of Islamic medicine mainly through the influence of his famous work \"al-Canon fi al Tibb\" (\"The Canon of Medicine\"). The book was originally used as a textbook for instructors and students of medical sciences in the medical school of Avicenna. The book is divided into 5 volumes:\nThe first volume is a compendium of medical principles, the second is a reference for individual drugs, the third contains organ-specific diseases, the fourth discusses systemic illnesses as well as a section of preventative health measures, and the fifth contains descriptions of compound medicines. The \"Canon\" was highly influential in medical schools and on later medical writers.\n\nIt is claimed that an important advance in the knowledge of human anatomy and physiology was made by Ibn al-Nafis, but whether this was discovered via human dissection is doubtful because \"al-Nafis tells us that he avoided the practice of dissection because of the shari'a and his own 'compassion' for the human body\".\n\nThe movement of blood through the human body was thought to be known due to the work of the Greek physicians. However, there was the question of how the blood flowed from the right ventricle of the heart to the left ventricle, before the blood is pumped to the rest of the body. According to Galen in the 2nd century, blood reached the left ventricle through invisible passages in the septum. By some means, Ibn al-Nafis, a 13th-century Syrian physician, found the previous statement on blood flow from the right ventricle to the left to be false. Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the ventricular septum was impenetrable, lacking any type of invisible passages, showing Galen's assumptions to be false. Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the blood in the right ventricle of the heart is instead carried to the left by way of the lungs. This discovery was one of the first descriptions of the pulmonary circulation, although his writings on the subject were only rediscovered in the 20th century, and it was William Harvey's later independent discovery which brought it to general attention.\n\nAccording to the Ancient Greeks, vision was thought to a visual spirit emanating from the eyes that allowed an object to be perceived. The 11th century Iraqi scientist Ibn al-Haytham, also known as Al-hazen in Latin, developed a radically new concept of human vision. Ibn al-Haytham took a straightforward approach towards vision by explaining that the eye was an optical instrument. The description on the anatomy of the eye led him to form the basis for his theory of image formation, which is explained through the refraction of light rays passing between 2 media of different densities. Ibn al-Haytham developed this new theory on vision from experimental investigations. In the 12th century, his \"Book of Optics\" was translated into Latin and continued to be studied both in the Islamic world and in Europe until the 17th century.\n\nAhmad ibn Abi al-Ash'ath, a famous physician from Mosul, Iraq, described the physiology of the stomach in a live lion in his book \"al-Quadi wa al-muqtadi\". He wrote:\n\nAhmad ibn Abi al-Ash'ath observed the physiology of the stomach in a live lion in 959. This description preceded William Beaumont by almost 900 years, making Ahmad ibn al-Ash'ath the first person to initiate experimental events in gastric physiology.\n\nAccording to Galen, in his work entitled \"De ossibus ad tirones\", the lower jaw consists of two parts, proven by the fact that it disintegrates in the middle when cooked. Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi, while on a visit to Egypt, encountered many skeletal remains of those who had died from starvation near Cairo. He examined the skeletons and established that the mandible consists of one piece, not two as Galen had taught. He wrote in his work \"Al-Ifada w-al-Itibar fi al_Umar al Mushahadah w-al-Hawadith al-Muayanah bi Ard Misr\", or \"Book of Instruction and Admonition on the Things Seen and Events Recorded in the Land of Egypt\":\n\nUnfortunately, Al-Baghdadi's discovery did not gain much attention from his contemporaries, because the information is rather hidden within the detailed account of the geography, botany, monuments of Egypt, as well as of the famine and its consequences. He never published his anatomical observations in a separate book, as had been his intention.\n\nMedical contributions made by medieval Islam included the use of plants as a type of remedy or medicine. Medieval Islamic physicians used natural substances as a source of medicinal drugs—including \"Papaver somniferum\" Linnaeus, poppy, and \"Cannabis sativa\" Linnaeus, hemp. In pre-Islamic Arabia, neither poppy nor hemp was known. Hemp was introduced into the Islamic countries in the ninth century from India through Persia and Greek culture and medical literature. The Greek, Dioscorides, who according to the Arabs is the greatest botanist of antiquity, recommended hemp seeds to \"quench geniture\" and its juice for earaches. Beginning in 800 and lasting for over two centuries, poppy use was restricted to the therapeutic realm. However, the dosages often exceeded medical need and was used repeatedly despite what was originally recommended. Poppy was prescribed by Yuhanna b. Masawayh to relieve pain from attacks of gallbladder stones, for fevers, indigestion, eye, head and tooth aches, pleurisy, and to induce sleep. Although poppy had medicinal benefits, Ali al-Tabari explained that the extract of poppy leaves was lethal, and that the extracts and opium should be considered poisons.\n\nThe development and growth of hospitals in ancient Islamic society expanded the medical practice to what is currently known as surgery. Surgical procedures were known to physicians during the medieval period because of earlier texts that included descriptions of the procedures. Translation from pre-Islamic medical publishings was a fundamental building block for physicians and surgeons in order to expand the practice. Surgery was uncommonly practiced by physicians and other medical affiliates due to a very low success rate, even though earlier records provided favorable outcomes to certain operations. There were many different types of procedures performed in ancient Islam, especially in the area of ophthalmology.\n\nBloodletting and cauterization were techniques widely used in ancient Islamic society by physicians, as a therapy to treat patients. These two techniques were commonly practiced because of the wide variety of illnesses they treated. Cauterization, a procedure used to burn the skin or flesh of a wound, was performed to prevent infection and stop profuse bleeding. To perform this procedure, physicians heated a metal rod and used it to burn the flesh or skin of a wound. This would cause the blood from the wound to clot and eventually heal the wound.\n\nBloodletting, the surgical removal of blood, was used to cure a patient of bad \"humours\" considered deleterious to one's health. A phlebotomist performing bloodletting on a patient drained the blood straight from the veins. \"Wet\" cupping, a form of bloodletting, was performed by making a slight incision in the skin and drawing blood by applying a heated cupping glass. The heat and suction from the glass caused the blood to rise to the surface of the skin to be drained. “Dry cupping”, the placement of a heated cupping glass (without an incision) on a particular area of a patient's body to relieve pain, itching, and other common ailments, was also used. Though these procedures seem relatively easy for phlebotomists to perform, there were instances where they had to pay compensation for causing injury or death to a patient because of carelessness when making an incision. Both cupping and phlebotomy were considered helpful when a patient was sickly.\n\nSurgery was important in treating patients with eye complications, such as trachoma and cataracts. A common complication of trachoma patients is the vascularization of the tissue that invades the cornea of the eye, which was thought to be the cause of the disease, by ancient Islamic physicians. The technique used to correct this complication was done surgically and known today as peritomy. This procedure was done by \"employing an instrument for keeping the eye open during surgery, a number of very small hooks for lifting, and a very thin scalpel for excision.\" A similar technique in treating complications of trachoma, called pterygium, was used to remove the triangular-shaped part of the bulbar conjunctiva onto the cornea. This was done by lifting the growth with small hooks and then cut with a small lancet. Both of these surgical techniques were extremely painful for the patient and intricate for the physician or his assistants to perform.\n\nIn medieval Islamic literature, cataracts were thought to have been caused by a membrane or opaque fluid that rested between the lens and the pupil. The method for treating cataracts in medieval Islam (known in English as couching) was known through translations of earlier publishings on the technique. A small incision was made in the sclera with a lancet and a probe was then inserted and used to depress the lens, pushing it to one side of the eye. After the procedure was complete, the eye was then washed with salt water and then bandaged with cotton wool soaked in oil of roses and egg whites. After the operation, there was concern that the cataract, once it had been pushed to one side, would reascend, which is why patients were instructed to lie on his or her back for several days following the surgery.\n\nIn both modern society and medieval Islamic society, anesthesia and antisepsis are important aspects of surgery. Before the development of anesthesia and antisepsis, surgery was limited to fractures, dislocations, traumatic injuries resulting in amputation, and urinary disorders or other common infections. Ancient Islamic physicians attempted to prevent infection when performing procedures for a sick patient, for example by washing a patient before a procedure; similarly, following a procedure, the area was often cleaned with “wine, wined mixed with oil of roses, oil of roses alone, salt water, or vinegar water”, which have antiseptic properties. Various herbs and resins including frankincense, myrrh, cassia, and members of the laurel family were also used to prevent infections, although it is impossible to know exactly how effective these treatments were in the prevention of sepsis. The pain-killing uses of opium had been known since ancient times; other drugs including “henbane, hemlock, soporific black nightshade, lettuce seeds” were also used by Islamic physicians to treat pain. Some of these drugs, especially opium, were known to cause drowsiness, and some modern scholars have argued that these drugs were used to cause a person to lose consciousness before an operation, as a modern-day anesthetic would. However, there is no clear reference to such a use before the 16th century.\n\nIslamic scholars introduced mercuric chloride to disinfect wounds.\n\nPhysicians like al-Razi wrote about the importance of morality in medicine, and may have presented, together with Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, the first concept of ethics in Islamic medicine. He felt that it was important not only for the physician to be an expert in his field, but also to be a role model. His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three concepts: the physician's responsibility to patients and to self, and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.\n\nThe earliest surviving Arabic work on medical ethics is Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi's \"Adab al-Tabib\" ( \"Adab aț-Ṭabīb\", \"Morals of the physician\" or \"Practical Medical Deontology\") and was based on the works of Hippocrates and Galen. Al-Ruhawi regarded physicians as \"guardians of souls and bodies\", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics.\n\nMany hospitals were developed during the early Islamic era. They were called Bimaristan, or Dar al-Shifa, the Persian and Arabic words meaning \"house [or place] of the sick\" and \"house of curing,\" respectively. The idea of a hospital being a place for the care of sick people was taken from the early Caliphs. The bimaristan is seen as early as the time of Muhammad, and the Prophet's mosque in the city of Madinah held the first Muslim hospital service in its courtyard. During the Ghazwah Khandaq (the Battle of the Trench), Muhammad came across wounded soldiers and he ordered a tent be assembled to provide medical care. Over time, Caliphs and rulers expanded traveling bimaristans to include doctors and pharmacists.\n\nUmayyad Caliph Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik is often credited with building the first bimaristan in Damascus in 707 AD. The bimaristan had a staff of salaried physicians and a well equipped dispensary. It treated the blind, lepers and other disabled people, and also separated those patients with leprosy from the rest of the ill. Some consider this bimaristan no more than a \"lepersoria\" because it only segregated patients with leprosy. The first true Islamic hospital was built during the reign of Caliph Harun al-Rashid. The Caliph invited the son of chief physician, Jabril ibn Bukhtishu to head the new Baghdad bimaristan. It quickly achieved fame and led to the development of other hospitals in Baghdad.\n\nAs hospitals developed during the Islamic civilization, specific characteristics were attained. Bimaristans were secular. They served all people regardless of their race, religion, citizenship, or gender. The Waqf documents stated nobody was ever to be turned away. The ultimate goal of all physicians and hospital staff was to work together to help the well-being of their patients. There was no time limit a patient could spend as an inpatient; the Waqf documents stated the hospital was required to keep all patients until they were fully recovered. Men and women were admitted to separate but equally equipped wards. The separate wards were further divided into mental disease, contagious disease, non-contagious disease, surgery, medicine, and eye disease. Patients were attended to by same sex nurses and staff. Each hospital contained a lecture hall, kitchen, pharmacy, library, mosque and occasionally a chapel for Christian patients. Recreational materials and musicians were often employed to comfort and cheer patients up.\n\nThe hospital was not just a place to treat patients: it also served as a medical school to educate and train students. Basic science preparation was learned through private tutors, self-study and lectures. Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of patients and their medical treatment. Students were responsible in keeping these patient records, which were later edited by doctors and referenced in future treatments.\n\nDuring this era, physician licensure became mandatory in the Abbasid Caliphate. In 931 AD, Caliph Al-Muqtadir learned of the death of one of his subjects as a result of a physician's error. He immediately ordered his muhtasib Sinan ibn Thabit to examine and prevent doctors from practicing until they passed an examination. From this time on, licensing exams were required and only qualified physicians were allowed to practice medicine.\n\nThe birth of pharmacy as an independent, well-defined profession was established in the early ninth century by Muslim scholars. Al-Biruni states that \"pharmacy became independent from medicine as language and syntax are separate from composition, the knowledge of prosody from poetry, and logic from philosophy, for it [pharmacy] is an aid [to medicine] rather than a servant\". Sabur (d. 869) wrote the first text on pharmacy.\n\nDuring the medieval time period Hippocratic treatises became used widespread by medieval physicians, due the treatises practical form as well as their accessibility for medieval practicing physicians. Hippocratic treatises of Gynecology and Obstetrics were commonly referred to by Muslim clinicians when discussing female diseases. The Hippocratic authors associated women's general and reproductive health and organs and functions that were believed to have no counterparts in the male body.\n\nThe Hippocratics blamed the womb for many of the women's health problems, such as schizophrenia. They described the womb as an independent creature inside the female body; and, when the womb was not fixed in place by pregnancy, the womb which craves moisture, was believed to move to moist body organs such as the liver, heart, and brain. The movement of the womb was assumed to cause many health conditions, most particularly that of menstruation was also considered essential for maintaining women's general health.\n\nMany beliefs regarding women's bodies and their health in the Islamic context can be found in the religious literature known as \"medicine of the prophet.\" These texts suggested that men stay away from women during their menstrual periods, “for this blood is corrupt blood,” and could actually harm those who come in contact with it. Much advice was given with respect to the proper diet to encourage female health and in particular fertility. For example: quince makes a woman's heart tender and better; incense will result in the woman giving birth to a male; the consumption of water melons while pregnant will increase the chance the child is of good character and countenance; dates should be eaten both before childbirth to encourage the bearing of sons and afterwards to aid the woman's recovery; parsley and the fruit of the palm tree stimulates sexual intercourse; asparagus eases the pain of labor; and eating the udder of an animal increases lactation in women. In addition to being viewed as a religiously significant activity, sexual activity was considered healthy in moderation for both men and women. However, the pain and medical risk associated with childbirth was so respected that women who died while giving birth could be viewed as martyrs. The use of invocations to God, and prayers were also a part of religious belief surrounding women's health, the most notable being Muhammad's encounter with a slave-girl whose scabbed body he saw as evidence of her possession by the Evil Eye. He recommended that the girl and others possessed by the Eye use a specific invocation to God in order to rid themselves of its debilitating effects on their spiritual and physical health.\n\nIt has been written that male guardians such as fathers and husbands did not consent to their wives or daughters being examined by male practitioners unless absolutely necessary in life or death circumstances. The male guardians would just as soon treat their women themselves or have them be seen by female practitioners for the sake of privacy. The women similarly felt the same way; such is the case with pregnancy and the accompanying processes such as child birth and breastfeeding, which were solely reliant upon advice given by other women. The role of women as practitioners appears in a number of works despite the male dominance within the medical field. Two female physicians from Ibn Zuhr's family served the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century. Later in the 15th century, female surgeons were illustrated for the first time in Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu's \"Cerrahiyyetu'l-Haniyye\" (\"Imperial Surgery\"). Treatment provided to women by men was justified to some by prophetic medicine (al-tibba alnabawi), otherwise known as \"medicine of the prophet\" (tibb al-nabi), which provided the argument that men can treat women, and women men, even if this means they must expose the patient's genitals in necessary circumstances.\n\nFemale doctors, midwives, and wet nurses have all been mentioned in literature of the time period.\n\nA hospital and medical training center existed at Gundeshapur. The city of Gundeshapur was founded in 271 by the Sassanid king Shapur I. It was one of the major cities in Khuzestan province of the Persian empire in what is today Iran. A large percentage of the population were Syriacs, most of whom were Christians. Under the rule of Khosrau I, refuge was granted to Greek Nestorian Christian philosophers including the scholars of the Persian School of Edessa (Urfa)(also called the Academy of Athens), a Christian theological and medical university. These scholars made their way to Gundeshapur in 529 following the closing of the academy by Emperor Justinian. They were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts. The arrival of these medical practitioners from Edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical center at Gundeshapur. It included a medical school and hospital (bimaristan), a pharmacology laboratory, a translation house, a library and an observatory. Indian doctors also contributed to the school at Gundeshapur, most notably the medical researcher Mankah. Later after Islamic invasion, the writings of Mankah and of the Indian doctor Sustura were translated into Arabic at Baghdad. Daud al-Antaki was one of the last generation of influential Arab Christian writers.\n\nMedieval Islam's receptiveness to new ideas and heritages helped it make major advances in medicine during this time, adding to earlier medical ideas and techniques, expanding the development of the health sciences and corresponding institutions, and advancing medical knowledge in areas such as surgery and understanding of the human body, although many Western scholars have not fully acknowledged its influence (independent of Roman and Greek influence) on the development of medicine.\n\nThrough the establishment and development of hospitals, ancient Islamic physicians were able to provide more intrinsic operations to cure patients, such as in the area of ophthalmology. This allowed for medical practices to be expanded and developed for future reference.\n\nThe contributions of the two major Muslim philosophers and physicians, Al-Razi and Ibn Sina, provided a lasting impact on Muslim medicine. Through their compilation of knowledge into medical books they each had a major influence on the education and filtration of medical knowledge in Islamic culture.\n\nAdditionally there were some iconic contributions made by women during this time, such as the documentation: of female doctors, physicians, surgeons, wet nurses, and midwives.\n\n\n"}

He is described as being 5' 8\" and wearing grease and red ochre all over his body and as the chief / leader of Parlevar people prior to Governor Arthur's proclamation treaty with Mannalargenna. Following the arrival of British in the area, he led a series of guerrilla styled resistance attacks against British military soldiers / police in Tasmania during the period known as the Black War. In 1829 he freed four Native women and a boy from John Batman's house where they had been held for a year.\n\nWhile it seems as though he joined George Robinson's mission to persuade Native people to \"surrender\", it is claimed that he was actually directing Robinson away from the people. He was promised that if he helped Robinson he would not be sent to Flinders Island, but this promise was broken and he died in captivity at Wybalenna in 1835. When he arrived at Big Green Island in 1835, Mannalargenna symbolically cut off his ochred hair and beard.\n\nMannalargenna had two wives. His first wife's name is unknown, but together they had at least five children: a son, Neerhepeererminer and daughters Woretermoeteyenner, Wottecowidyer, Wobbelty and Teekoolterme. His second wife was Tanleboneyer with whom he had no children. She was one of George Robinson's early guides.\n\nDuring his life, Mannalargenna's sister and four daughters were married to seamen from the Furneaux Islands and their babies were swapped around and documented down incorrectly. Today, many Australian citizens claim a non biological lineage through these British commonwealth documented marriages.\n\n\"Mannalergenna Day\" has celebrated in early December in Little Musselroe Bay in Tasmania since 2015. The event is in commemoration of Mannalargenna and of celebrating Parlevar culture.\n\nThere is a monument to Mannalargenna at Wybalenna Mission Site Cemetery.\n\nA sketch of Mannalargenna by artist Thomas Bock is held in the British Museum.\n\n"}

The 40-minute film was written by Annaud with Alain Godard. It was the first dramatic film shot in the IMAX format.\n\n\"Wings of Courage\" is an account of the real-life story of early airmail operations in South America. \n\nIn 1920s South America, a small group of French pilots led by aviation pioneer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (Tom Hulce) struggle to prove they can offer a reliable airmail service over the Andes. When one of the young airmail pilots, Henri Guillaumet (Craig Sheffer), crashes on such a flight in the Andes, a search is started. Henri has to try and get back to civilization on foot. Back home, his wife Noelle (Elizabeth McGovern) and colleagues start to fear the worst.\n\n\"Wings of Courage\" was the first IMAX 3-D short film created to be projected on the world's largest screens, with a process that uses a wider film gauge, more intense light and a brighter screen (covered with five coats of silver). The 3-D glasses were also a new type, liquid crystal lenses that are controlled by radio waves with each lens blinking 48 times a second, in sync with the projected image.\n\nFor Roger Ebert', \"Wings of Courage\" is \"... a technical, rather than an artistic achievement.\" In the review in \"The New York Times\", Caryn James had a similar evaluation: \"'Wings of Courage' is a swooping, old-fashioned adventure tale that uses flashy newfangled technology.

Carved from a single log and covered on the playing end with a stretched sharkskin, the pahu is played with the palms and fingers of the hand. It is considered a sacred instrument and was generally kept in a temple (heiau), and used to accompany a repertoire of sacred songs called hula pahu/ura pau.\n\nThe Hawaiian term Pahu translates into 'drum,' ‘Niu’ being the Hawaiian word for ‘coconut.' Although there are a number of specific types of percussion instruments used in Hawaiian cultural expressions of music, the Pahu is perhaps one of the most important percussion devices known to Hawaii, both ancient and modern, of the four main indigenous musical types (wooden drums, knee drums, calabash drums, and bamboo pipes).\n\nPahu may be found in the Hawaiian Islands in two main and distinctly different, but contextually related forms. The first is regarded as the Heiau Pahu, or religious drum (also known as the Pahu Pu’ule, or 'prayer drum'). The second has come to us in the form of the Hula Pahu, or musical accompaniment drum (sometimes referred to as the Pahu Mele, or song accompaniment drum). Both types of drum have a common ancient historical source.\n\nThe Pahu drum is a staple in traditional Hawaiian dance, providing a basic rhythmic accompaniment. The drums' tall, narrow body is carved from wood, usually from a segment of a coconut tree trunk, and the head is made from dried sharkskin. The traditional Hawaiian Pahu was made from a sectioned and seasoned wooden tree trunk, preferably of coconut wood, although possibly other types of native wood may have been used. The original material used for the Pahu’s waha (head) was either shark or ray skin. Heiau Pahu tended to be originally made with a waha of ray skin, while non-religious Pahu often used sharkskin.

It is composed of a single village, Satu Mare.\n\nIts Hungarian name was first recorded in 1566 as \"Marefalwa\", in 1602 as \"Máréfalva\". Its first Romanian name originated from the Hungarian form as \"Marefalău\". After 1919, Romanian authorities first renamed it Satul Mare, later Satu Mare.\n\nThe village was part of the Székely Land region of the historical Transylvania province. It belonged to Udvarhelyszék district until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when they fell within the Udvarhely County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, they became part of Romania and fell within Odorhei County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the village formally became part of Romania again in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the village fell within the Magyar Autonomous Region, between 1960 and 1968 the Mureș-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the village has been part of Harghita County.

It was hailed at its 1977 introduction as \"Britain's First Supercar\" (sometimes nicknamed \"British Muscle car\") for its top speed. Its engine was shared with the Lagonda, but it used high-performance camshafts, increased compression ratio, larger inlet valves and bigger carburettors mounted on new manifolds for increased output. Straight-line performance was the best of the day, with acceleration from 0– in 5.3 seconds, one-tenth of a second quicker than the Ferrari Daytona.\n\nThe first series equipped with four 48IDF2/100 Weber carburetors produced (estimated) at 5800 rpm and at 4500 rpm of torque, and series specific details such as a blanked bonnet vent and a separate rear spoiler. 38 of these were built (plus 13 \"Cosmetics\" for the US). The Oscar India (for 1 October, the date of introduction) version, introduced in late 1978, featured an integrated tea-tray spoiler and smoother bonnet bulge. Inside, a black leather-covered dash replaced the previous walnut. The wooden dashboard did find its way back into the Vantage during the eighties, giving a more luxurious appearance. The Oscar India version also received a slight increase in power, to . This line was produced, with some running changes, until 1989. From 1986 the engine had .\n\nOne of the most noticeable features was the closed-off hood bulge rather than the open scoop found on the normal V8. The grille area was also closed off, with twin driving lights inserted and a spoiler added to the bootlid.\n\nThe 1986–1989 580 'X-Pack' was a further upgrade, with Cosworth pistons and Nimrod racing-type heads producing 403 hp. A 'big bore' after-market option was also available from Works Service, with 50 mm carbs (instead of 48 mm) and straight-through exhaust system giving 432 hp (the same engine as fitted to the limited-edition V8 Zagato. 16-inch wheels were also now fitted.

Of the 'Cosmetic' Vantage (for the US Swiss and Japanese markets, with fuel injection instead of Weber carburettors), 14 Series 2 coupés and 56 Volantes were built. Cosmetic Vantages lacked the powerful Vantage engine but retained the Vantage name and most of its body alterations - though the lack of carburettors allowed a flattened hood. From 1980 they featured DOT-approved safety bumpers front and rear. Most of these cars have since been retrofitted with full power, European spec engines.\n\nAlthough the full spec (carburettor) Vantage models were not imported into the USA when new, they now qualify for entry under the DOT's 'Show and Display' rules in most US States. Federal requirements are also less strict for cars over 25 years old (as most Vantages now are).\n\nA Vantage Volante convertible version was also produced between 1986 and 1989. Six mechanically similar cars had been built earlier to special order, but it was not regularly available until then. The production version featured an even deeper front spoiler than fitted to the Vantage, even wider wheel arches, and extended side skirts. The Vantage Volante also had a rear spoiler, which the regular Volante did not feature. In total, 166 Vantage Volantes were built, with the last ones leaving the factory in December 1989. In 1987 Charles, Prince of Wales took delivery of a Vantage Volante, but at his request without the production car's wider wheelarches, front air dam and side skirts. This became known as the 'Prince of Wales Spec' (or PoW) and around another 26 such cars were built by the factory.

Aston Martin has previously used the \"Vantage\" name on high-performance variants of their existing GT models, notably on the Virage-based car of the 1990s. The modern car, in contrast, is the leanest and most agile car in Aston's lineup. As such, it is intended as a more focused model to reach out to potential buyers of cars such as the Porsche 911 as well as the exotic sports and GT cars with which Aston Martins traditionally compete.\n\nProduction of the V8 Vantage ended in 2017 while production of the V12 Vantage continued until 2018. In November 2017, Aston Martin unveiled a new redesigned Vantage. The new model was unveiled in 2017 and began production in 2018.\n\nFollowing the unveiling of the AMV8 Vantage concept car in 2003 at the North American International Auto Show designed by Henrik Fisker, the production version, known as the V8 Vantage was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 2005 for the 2006 model year. The two seat, two-door coupé had a bonded aluminium structure for strength and lightness. The 172.5 inch (4.38 m) long car featured a hatchback-style tailgate for practicality, with a large luggage shelf behind the seats. In addition to the coupé, a convertible, known as the V8 Vantage Roadster, was introduced later in that year.\n\nThe V8 Vantage was initially powered by a 4.3 L (4,280 cc) quad-cam 32-valve V8 which produced at 7,300 rpm and at 5,000 rpm. However, models produced after 2008 had a 4.7-litre V8 with and of torque. Though based loosely on Jaguar's AJ-V8 engine architecture, this engine was unique to Aston Martin and featured race-style dry-sump lubrication, which enabled it to be mounted low in the chassis for an improved center of gravity. The cylinder block and heads, crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, inlet and exhaust manifolds, lubrication system and engine management were all designed in house by Aston Martin and the engine was assembled by hand at the AM facility in Cologne, Germany, which also built the V12 engine for the DB9 and Vanquish.\n\nThe engine was front mid-mounted with a rear-mounted transaxle, giving a 49/51 front/rear weight distribution. Slotted Brembo brakes were also standard. The original V8 Vantage could accelerate from 0 to in 4.8 seconds before topping out at .\n\nIn 2008, Aston Martin introduced an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade package for power and handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with the company. The power upgrade was called the V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre V8 engine with an increase in Peak power of 20 bhp to while peak torque increased by 10 Nm to . This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved air box, right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal and a manifold badge.\n\nThe V8 Vantage had a retail price of GB£79,000, US$110,000, or €104,000 in 2006, Aston Martin planned to build up to 3,000 per year. Included was a 6-speed manual transmission and leather-upholstery for the seats, dash board, steering-wheel, and shift-knob. A new 6-speed sequential manual transmission, similar to those produced by Ferrari and Lamborghini, called Sportshift was introduced later as an option.\n\nIn their 2006 readership survey, readers of Car Design News voted the Aston Martin V8 Vantage as the best current production car design. The survey results were based on over 1,000 responses, most from working automotive designers and students of industrial and automotive design. The Vantage was also voted one of Automobile magazine's 2007 \"All Stars\" for its performance, road manners, and design. The V8 Vantage is also one of the only two cars to be added to \"The DB9 Section\", – a mini-fridge reserved for the super \"cool\" – on the BBC's \"Top Gear\" (on which it is described as the \"baby Aston\" to differentiate it from the V12 powered DB9). The program rates cars from seriously un-cool to sub-zero. The fridge was an extra category added when the presenters deemed the Aston Martin DB9 too cool for the sub-zero category. In the 2005 awards, Jeremy Clarkson declared the V8 Vantage as Best Sounding Car of the Year and The Coolest Car of the Year, while the award winner was actually the Porsche 911. While the V8 Vantage remains a rare and special car by any standard, the success of the model is highlighted by the completion of chassis number 10,000 – a specially ordered Onyx coupé delivered to a customer in USA – in the first half of 2008. While the production of 10,000 cars is a tiny number by the standards of typical car manufacturers, it is a significant milestone for an Aston Martin model – the DB9 being the only other Aston Martin model to have achieved that figure.\n\nIn May 2008, Aston Martin announced new technological updates for the Vantage, which included changes to the engine, transmission, suspension and appearance. New cylinder liners that were now pressed into the aluminium block instead of the original cast-in variants allow a thinner liner, which in turn allows a larger capacity of 4.7 L. The cylinder bore and stroke has been increased from to and to respectively, giving a total displacement of 4,735 cc. The dry sump lubrication system was also modified.\n\nThe \"Sportshift\" automated manual transmission benefited from a software update, while a lightened flywheel was introduced for both the manual and the Sportshift versions. Aston Martin also stiffened the suspension and the suspension system now uses Bilstein dampers. An optional sports pack was offered with stiffer springs for better handling and all-new 5-spoke alloy wheels. Sportshift-equipped models also received a new dual throttle mapping update which allows the driver to choose from the default sport mode, or comfort mode, which gives more comfortable shifts and throttle input for drivability. For the 2012 model year, Aston Martin replaced the 6-speed Sportshift with the 7-speed Sportshift II first utilised in the V8 Vantage S.\n\nNew wheels are also part of the update including 20-spoke alloy wheels and new 5-spoke aluminium wheels for the sport pack. The interior has been changed slightly, using an updated console similar to the Aston Martin DBS and the DB9.\n\nThe update provides the Vantage with a power increase to at 7,000 rpm (an 11% increase) and a peak torque of at 5,750 rpm (a 15% increase), providing the car with additional reserves of mid-range performance and an improved top speed of . The Vantage can now accelerate from 0 to in 4.3 seconds, half a second faster over the outgoing model. Combined European fuel economy and emissions are also improved by 13% (Sportshift).\n\nAston Martin has produced eighteen variants of the Vantage, which are:\n\nAt the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, Aston Martin officially unveiled the V8 Vantage Roadster. The car gained over the coupé, but Aston Martin claimed the car would have the same performance as the coupé. To compensate for the loss of the roof a new, super-stiff cross-member was added to the frame. The soft top could be raised or lowered electronically in 18 seconds and could be operated at speeds up to .\nIt had the same 4.3-litre V8 from the coupé version producing at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm along with having a maximum speed of . It would accelerate from 0 to in 4.8 seconds. The 2009 Vantage Roadster features swan wing doors, a leather and alcantara interior and a zinc alloy centre console and a crystal-capped key fob. It also featured the updated 4.7-litre V8 which produces and of torque, and can accelerate from 0 to in 4.5 seconds before reaching a top speed of .\n\nIn 2007, Prodrive released a tuning package for the V8 Vantage, which consists of four separate packages that can be installed in stages. These four packages are for the engine, suspension, wheels, and aerodynamics.\n\nThe engine package includes an engine control unit remapping and minor engine modifications that increase power on the 4.3 L engine by , and torque by . Throttle control is also remapped. Also included is an exhaust modification which allows the driver to leave the by-pass valves in three separate settings. The suspension package replaces portions of the car's suspension system with Bilstein and Eibach parts, which are claimed to make the vehicle more responsive and accurate through the corners.\n\nThe tyre and wheel package replaces the stock wheels with lighter twin-7 spoke alloys from Prodrive Japan. The wheels are similar to those on the DBR9, and each wheel weighs less than their stock counterpart. Pirelli P-Zero tyres are used, and the rear wheels are widened to . The aerodynamic package adds a carbon fibre front splitter and rear lip-spoiler, which together reduce lift by up to 45%.\n\nPackages could be ordered direct from Prodrive or from an Aston Martin dealer, though all packages are installed by Prodrive. 0 to acceleration times are claimed to drop by 0.5 seconds to about 4.3 seconds and 0- times are improved by 0.9 seconds.\n\nTo commemorate the company's racing successes at the Nürburgring, Aston Martin released the limited edition N400 at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The N400s 4.3 L V8 was tuned to produce hence the name, and the car also featured a sports pack which included lightweight graphite-finished wheels, uprated springs and dampers and a new rear anti-roll bar. The N400 was available in three special paint colours; Bergwerk Black, Lightning Silver and Karussell Orange. Each N400 came with perforated leather trim, including a map of the Nürburgring stitched on the center armrest, and a numbered plaque.\n\nAston Martin tested the car at the Nurburgring Nordschleife circuit where it was able to complete a lap in under eight minutes. The N400 package was available as either a coupe or roadster with a total of 480 examples (240 coupes, 240 Roadsters) being built, in note of the fact that there are 480 seconds in 8 minutes.\n\nThe N420 became the successor to the special edition N400 of 2007, based upon the standard 4.7-litre V8 Vantage and available either a coupé or roadster and with either the 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed Sportshift transmission. The motorsport-inspired V8 Vantage N420 came with the Sports Pack suspension as standard, a new sports exhaust system and many carbon fibre components which resulted in a weight saving over the standard car. In addition, the N420 has distinctive Aston Martin 'Race Collection' paint schemes available as an option although any other colour could be specified. Along with that, the N420 has the extended N400 sills, a carbon fibre front splitter, side strakes and diffuser along with 10-spoke diamond turned alloy wheels with gloss black finish, black mesh vents and 'Graphitic' tailpipe finishers.\n\nOn 25 January 2011, Aston Martin unveiled the V8 Vantage S, a more potent version of the V8 Vantage available in both coupé and Roadster body styles and designed to create a more sporty experience than the standard V8 Vantage. The engine is the same 4.7-litre \"AJ37\" V8 found in the base Vantage, but with improved intake airflow, new mufflers, and new programming that keeps the exhaust system's bypass valves open for longer. The 4.7-litre V8 engine has been modified to deliver a peak power of at 7,300 rpm and torque of at 5,000 rpm representing an increase of 10 bhp and 20 Nm respectively. The modifications allowed for improved acceleration time of 0 to in 4.0 seconds, 0.3 seconds faster than the base model. Engine output flows through a new single-clutch 7-speed Graziano automated manual to a limited-slip rear differential; the carbon fibre driveshaft spins in an aluminium torque tube. From there, power is applied to the pavement via a set of (285/35) Bridgestone Potenza tyres on 19-inch cast aluminium wheels. Bushings, springs, and dampers were stiffened for the S model and the steering rack is quicker than in the base model. These modifications result in an exceptional level of response. The aerodynamic enhancements include a deeper front bumper with carbon fibre splitter, larger side sills, a carbon fibre diffuser and a larger tailgate lip designed to sharpen the handling on the road. Additional visual differences include new wheels.\n\nA major difference in the Vantage S is the inclusion of the Sportshift II transmission, a 7-speed sequential manual gearbox, as standard. The Sportshift II is lighter than the 6-speed Sportshift fitted on the standard Vantage. This contributes, along with other weight saving parts, to a total vehicle kerb weight of , a reduction of over the standard V8 Vantage.\n\nLater in 2013, a special model was unveiled named the SP10 as a celebration of Aston Martin's success in the Nürburgring 24-hour endurance race. Available as both in coupé and roadster body style, the SP10 features the same 4.7-litre V8 engine developing and of torque. The car remains almost identical to the V8 Vantage S but includes a 6-speed manual transmission as standard with the Sportshift II transmission available as an option. Other bespoke features included a special Ceramic Grey body colour with the soft top of the roadster in Titan Grey, 19-inch cast aluminium wheels with V-shaped spokes finished in high gloss black colour with black brake callipers, a front splitter and rear diffuser made from carbon fibre and clear tail lamps.\n\nThe N430 version of the V8 Vantage was announced just a few weeks ahead of the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, following on from the previous and desirable N400 and N420 editions. This new model is mechanically based on the standard V8 Vantage but with the addition of the 'S' 430 bhp V8 engine, 'S' suspension and some unique styling features, together with either the regular 6-speed manual or the Prodrive developed 7-speed Sportshift II transmission with paddle shift.\n\nAnnounced on the eve of the New York Auto Show in April 2014, the V8 Vantage GT is what is in effect, the US version of the Vantage N430. This new North American-only model is mechanically based on the standard V8 Vantage but with the addition of the 'S' 430 bhp engine, 'S' suspension and some unique styling features, together with either the regular 6-speed manual or the Prodrive developed 7-speed Sportshift II transmission with paddle shift.\n\nIn 2017, Aston Martin announced a limited, track focused iteration of the V8 Vantage: the Vantage GT8. \nThe company would only manufacture 150 cars, 50 more than the GT12. The GT8 features the same 4.7-litre V8 as found in the base Vantage but with power now increased to , and has a top speed of . The GT8 is available with either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed Sportshift II automated sequential transmission, and has a kerb weight of , a reduction over the V8 Vantage S.\n\nOn 11 December 2007, as part of Aston Martin's opening of their own design studio, the company unveiled a concept car based on the V8 Vantage. The car, known as the V12 Vantage RS, featured the \"AM11\" V12 engine from the DBS and produced and of torque. The power along with the curb weight of allows the car to accelerate from 0 to in 4.2 seconds and achieve a top speed of .\n\nOther additions include a new rear diffuser, a retractable rear-wing which can be raised or lowered and carbon-ceramic brakes. The boot-lid and vented bonnet are also made from carbon fibre to help decrease the car's weight. In early 2008, Aston Martin's CEO confirmed production of the V12 Vantage RS for mid-2009.\n\nDevelopment prototypes of the V12 Vantage RS appeared in April 2008 before Aston Martin unveiled the production version simply called the V12 Vantage in 2009.\n\nOn the finale of the 13th series of \"Top Gear\", presenter Jeremy Clarkson drove the car simply saying that \"It's wonderful, wonderful, wonderful\".\n\nThe V12 Vantage was confirmed for the United States market. The then CEO, Dr. Urlich Bez personally confirmed that USA homologation is underway. This was in response to the decision of expanding the production run beyond 1,000 units. According to the automaker, some subtle changes were necessary to the structure of the car in order for it to meet North and South American regulations. In addition to these enhancements, the company also announced that it would be adding a new Carbon Black version of the V12 Vantage exclusively for the American market.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, Aston Martin announced that they were developing a GT3 version of the V12 Vantage, to replace the Aston Martin DBRS9. The race car was expected to be delivered by early 2012.\nAston Martin unveiled a convertible version called the V12 Vantage Roadster in 2013. The roadster weighs more due to chassis stiffening modifications, and because of the additional weight the roadster accelerates from 0 to in 4.5 seconds, but retains the coupe's top speed of .\n\nOn 28 May 2013, Aston Martin announced the V12 Vantage S – a sportier version of the V12 Vantage that it preceded it.\n\nThe V12 Vantage S produces at 6750 rpm and at 5750 rpm of torque from a revised V12 engine called the \"AM28\", which would be used as a base for future engines. The power is transferred to the rear wheels using a new 7-speed Sportshift III automated sequential transmission, which weighs less than the Sportshift II, with no option for a manual transmission.\n\nThe exhaust on the V12 Vantage S was developed from the company's own One-77.\n\nThe V12 Vantage S is claimed to be able to accelerate from 0 to in 3.8 seconds and reach a top speed of , making it the fastest production Aston Martin in history alongside the One-77.\n\nWith a total kerb weight of , the V12 Vantage S is lighter than the V12 Vantage and features new three-stage adaptive damping for the suspension system, new carbon ceramic brakes, and a unique track-mode for improved track performance for the drivers who want to take their car to the track.\n\nStyling and aerodynamic changes include a carbon fibre front grille, black roof and rear grille, lightweight forged alloy wheels, and new finishes on the interior seats, doors and controls.\n\nAston Martin also launched a convertible version in 2014 called the V12 Vantage S Roadster. The roadster is heavier than the coupe. Due to the added weight the roadster accelerates from 0 to in 4.1 seconds before reaching a top speed of .\n\nIn April 2016, the V12 Vantage S was announced to be produced with a 7-speed dog-leg manual transmission, unusual for its day and age. The shift pattern was engraved on the door sill. Only 100 were produced for the United States.\n\nAt the 2011 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este a racing concept by Zagato based on the V12 Vantage premiered celebrating the 50th anniversary of the DB4 GT Zagato. It was awarded with the competition's \"Design Award for Concept Cars and Prototypes\" which was also awarded to the One-77 two years ago. The car then was brought to Nürburgring where it had its racing debut during the 53rd ADAC ACAS H&R-Cup VLN race on 28 May and competed in the 2011 24 Hours of Nürburgring driven amongst others by CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez.\n\nPowered by the same \"AM11\" V12 engine with and of torque found in the DBS and V12 Vantage, the concept features a new handcrafted aluminium body with a front similar to the one of the Vantage and a heavily modified middle, roof and rear section uniting design language used by both companies. Other features include an endurance racing fuel tank carrying up to 120 litres of fuel. Though being a racing concept Aston Martin produced a limited number of street legal examples as well.\n\nAston Martin confirmed the production of the Aston Martin Vantage GT3 special edition unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. The company would only manufacture 100 cars of the GT3 special edition. After a complaint from Porsche over the use of the \"GT3\" moniker, the car was renamed the Vantage GT12. The Vantage GT12 features a new iteration of the 5.9-litre \"AM28\" V12 that produces and of torque. It has a kerb weight of , and can accelerate from 0 to in 3.5 seconds.\n\nThe Aston Martin Vantage GT12 Roadster is a one-off project created by Aston Martin's Q division on a special customer request. The Vantage GT12 Roadster was officially revealed at the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed. It is mechanically similar to the Vantage GT12 and features a full carbon fibre body. The roadster was completed in a period of nine months and features the coupé's front splitter, bonnet, front spoiler and rear diffuser. The 7-speed Sportshift III automated manual transmission is also retained from the coupé but with a lower final drive ratio, reducing the top speed to . The carbon-ceramic brakes, ABS and traction control found in the GT12 coupé have been reconfigured for the roadster. The GT12 roadster weighs less than the V12 Vantage S roadster.\n\nAt the 2017 Geneva Motor Show, Aston Martin revealed the AMR Pro model as a new addition to the ever-expanding Vantage line. The AMR Pro is designed to be a \"civilian\" accessible race car and to slot under the Vulcan track car. The AMR Pro features many design traits from both the Vantage GT3 and GTE race cars, including a massive rear wing, larger front splitter, and exposed carbon fibre. It also features unique styling touches like a black mesh grille and unique black wheels. The AMR Pro uses a variant of the GT4 race car's V8 racing engine, and it puts out . Only seven Vantage AMR Pro were built.\n\nThe Vantage V600 is the last production variant of the V12 Vantage built as a tribute to the Virage V600. The car is the result of a special customer request of a bespoke and more powerful V12 Vantage. The customer ordering the car has agreed upon limited production of the car and thus 14 units will be built. The car features many unique bits which set it apart from the outgoing V12 Vantage. The hood is given a menacing bulge, and the louvered vents of the regular V12 Vantage have been replaced by more subtle circular holes arranged in a shape similar to the standard vents. The vents in the fenders have been changed as well, this time to something similar to those of the new Vantage. At the front, a grille shaped like that of the Rapide AMR replaces the normal one, but has its own unique mesh insert. At the rear, the V600 gets a custom diffuser and quad exhaust tips. The interior features carbon fibre inserts with dark anodized aluminum trim and leather. The \"AM28\" V12 engine found in the V12 Vantage S has been utilised and upgraded, power has now been raised to . The engine is coupled to a 7-speed manual transmission exclusive to this variant only. Deliveries of the Vantage V600 are scheduled to begin in late 2018.\n\nIn addition to the specific packages above, all variants of the Vantage series were offered with a wide range of personalisation options, particularly in the interior where several different shades of leather – and even stitching – may be chosen to complement or contrast each other and the body (and, in the case of the convertible, the roof). The \"N400\" engine modifications and/or sports chassis are also available individually for those owners who would like to combine the increased power or handling of the special edition with the more subtle original body, interior, and badging – much like the \"POW\" Vantages of the 1980s. Many thousands of choices of colour, trim, and options combined with the in house \"customisation\" available through Works Service make it possible for a Vantage owner to configure a unique individual car to his or her specifications.\n\nDuring the 2006 British Motor Show in London, Aston Martin Racing revealed a near stock version of the V8 Vantage that would compete in the Nürburgring 24 Hours endurance race. The car, now known as the V8 Vantage N24, was driven by Aston Martin CEO Dr. Ulrich Bez, development engineer Chris Porrit, development driver Wolfgang Schuhbauer and German journalist Horst Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch in the 24‑hour race. The car finished 4th in class and 24th overall, before being driven home on public roads after the race. While essentially much like the existing coupé, the N24 had a front splitter and extended door sills for aerodynamic efficiency, a full roll cage, a racing fuel tank, and other modifications necessary to make the car race worthy. Other modifications include the removal of most of the interior, including all seats, replaced by a lone Recaro drivers seat.\n\nLater in 2006, Aston Martin confirmed that they would offer the V8 Vantage N24 to customers as a track car similar to a Porsche 911 GT3 Cup. The N24 specification complies with FIA GT4 European Cup, German VLN series, Grand-Am Cup, and various other national series' requirements.\n\nThe V8 Vantage N24 was featured in the BBC television series \"Top Gear\", selected by James May in the presenters' quest to find the best driving road in Europe. Based on a grand tourer—less seat padding, air conditioning, suspension travel, and other comforts—the N24 was mocked by co-hosts Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson as an ill-considered choice.\n\nAdditional honours have included a first and second the 2007 European GT4 race at Silverstone, the first 3 places in their class at the 2008 Nurburgring 24 hours race (18th out of 220 cars entered overall), and strong showings in Bahrain, VLN racing, and other tracks and events throughout the world. The N24 was also the basis of a one-make pan-Asia series called Aston Martin Asia Cup. Competitors ran in identically-prepared N24s at various Asian circuits.\n\nIn late 2008, Aston Martin debuted an updated version of the N24, known as the V8 Vantage GT4. Its primary alteration is the introduction of the new 4.7 L V8 engine that also debuted in the production V8 Vantage. This replaces the 4.3 L V8 previously used in the V8 Vantage N24. The suspension and brakes have also been updated along with a new front splitter, wheels and a fixed rear wing.\n\nDeveloped alongside the N24, the V8 Vantage Rally GT undergoes similar modifications by Prodrive for use in rallying. The unique modifications include a slight increase in engine power, Eibach sport shocks, and an optional close-ratio gearbox. The Rally GTs were used by the Race of Champions as part of their line-up of cars in 2006.\n\nDebuting in 2008, the V8 Vantage GT2 is the most powerful racing variant of the V8 Vantage family. Designed to meet FIA and ACO GT2 class regulations, the Vantage GT2 would become a customer car for use in the FIA GT Championship, American Le Mans Series, Le Mans Series, and 24 Hours of Le Mans. The V8 Vantage GT2 has been tuned to be capable of running E85 ethanol or normal racing fuel, dependent on the racing series.\nAston Martin V8 Vantage GT2 saw its racing debut at the 2008 Grand Prix of Long Beach, driven by Paul Drayson, a former Minister of State in the United Kingdom, and Jonny Cocker, 2004 British GT Champion.\n\nJames Watt Automotive ran the V8 Vantage GT2 in the Le Mans Series 2008, although the car failed to make the start of its debut race due to mechanical problems.\n\nThe V8 Vantage GT2 was used by A Speed Team in the 2010 Super GT season.\n\nJMW Motorsport ran a V8 Vantage GT2 in the Le Mans Series 2010.\n\nFollowing the poor performance of the Aston Martin AMR-One prototype, Aston Martin Racing decided to switch to running the Vantage as a factory effort in 2012. The car was slightly upgraded and was called the Vantage GTE, which has improved bodywork and engine performance over the older GT2 model. One car was entered into the FIA World Endurance Championship, and a second car appeared at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nFor the 2012 Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge season, Multimatic Motorsports entered two Vantages in the series, using the 4.7-litre V8 engine. Upon debut at Daytona International Speedway, they finished sixteenth.\n\nIn 2012, Aston Martin unveiled a racing version of the V12 Vantage to replace the aging Aston Martin DBRS9 (which also used a V12 engine). The engine develops and . A carbon fibre drive-shaft mates the engine to an Xtrac 6-speed sequential transmission with automated paddle shift gear change. The Vantage GT3 has a dry weight of , with near 50/50 front/rear weight distribution. The car competed in the FIA GT1 World Championship and the Blancpain Endurance Series, while Tony Quinn raced the GT3 Vantage to second place in the 2013 Australian GT Championship.\n\n"}

It is native to the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico, in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León. It is found on cliffs and rocky slopes from 900 to 1,700 meters.\n\nSmall among the agaves, its green succulent leaves are long and lanceolate, 50–70 cm long and 3–5 cm at the base, where they are the widest. They have minute serrations (teeth) along the margins, but no teeth nor spine at the end. The leaves have a tendency to curl somewhat, in a fashion reminiscent of the octopus agave \"A. vilmoriniana\". The inflorescence spike is also short at 1.2-1.7 meters, and its upper third is densely covered with white or pale yellow flowers. The flowers are distinctive in that tepals arise from a disk-shaped receptacle rather than the usual tube. The stamens are quite long.\n\nGentry defines a group \"Choritepalae\" that includes \"A. bracteosa\" along with \"Agave ellemeetiana\" and \"Agave guiengola\", and states that the discoid receptacle and unarmed leaves are different enough from other agaves to justify placing \"A. bracteosa\" and \"A. ellemeetiana\" into a separate genus, but that characteristics of \"A. guiengola\" link the group to the rest of \"Agave\".\n"}

{"id": "2106968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106968", "title": "Augmentative and alternative communication", "text": "Augmentative and alternative communication\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication (AAC) encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those with a wide range of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.\n\nModern use of AAC began in the 1950s with systems for those who had lost the ability to speak following surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and speech synthesis, have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with physical disabilities.\nAAC systems are diverse: unaided communication uses no equipment and includes signing and body language, while aided approaches use external tools. Aided communication methods can range from paper and pencil to communication books or boards to speech generating devices (SGDs) or devices producing written output. The symbols used in AAC include gestures, photographs, pictures, line drawings, letters and words, which can be used alone or in combination. Body parts, pointers, adapted mice, or eye tracking can be used to select target symbols directly, and switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication, and as a result rate enhancement techniques may be used to reduce the number of selections required. These techniques include \"prediction\", in which the user is offered guesses of the word/phrase being composed, and \"encoding\", in which longer messages are retrieved using a prestored code.\n\nThe evaluation of a user's abilities and requirements for AAC will include the individual's motor, visual, cognitive, language and communication strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation requires the input of family members, particularly for early intervention. Respecting ethnicity and family beliefs are key to a family-centered and ethnically competent approach. Studies show that AAC use does not impede the development of speech, and may result in a modest increase in speech production. Users who have grown up with AAC report satisfying relationships and life activities; however, they may have poor literacy and are unlikely to be in employment.\n\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines augmentative and alternative communication as forms of communication including languages as well as display of text, large-print, tactile communication, plain language, accessible multimedia and accessible information and communications technology.\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication is used by individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals with a variety of congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as \"My Left Foot\" and \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\", based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.\n\nThe field was originally called \"Augmentative Communication\"; the term served to indicate that such communication systems were to supplement natural speech rather than to replace it. The addition of \"alternative\" followed later, when it became clear that for some individuals non-speech systems were their only means of communication. AAC users typically utilize a variety of aided and unaided communication strategies depending on the communication partners and the context.\n\nThere were three, relatively independent, research areas in the 1960s and 1970s that lead to the field of augmentative and alternative communication. First was the work on early electromechanical communication and writing systems. The second was the development of communication and language boards, and lastly there was the research on ordinary (without disability) child language development.\n\nUnaided AAC systems are those that do not require an external tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.\n\nIn contrast, sign languages have a linguistic base and permit the expression of an unlimited number of messages. Approaches to signing can be divided into two major categories, those that encode an existing language, and those that are languages in their own right. In the United States of America, Signing Exact English may be considered the most widely used example of the former and American Sign Language as a common example of the latter. Signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders. The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate fine motor and motor planning skills. Sign languages require more fine-motor coordination and are less transparent in meaning than gestural codes such as Amer-Ind; the latter limits the number of people able to understand the person's communication without training.\n\nAn AAC aid is any \"device, either electronic or non-electronic, that is used to transmit or receive messages\"; such aids range from communication books to speech generating devices. Since the skills, areas of difficulty and communication needs of AAC users vary greatly, an equally diverse range of communication aids and devices is required.\n\nLow-tech communication aids are defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.\n\nHigh-tech AAC aids permit the storage and retrieval of electronic messages, with most allowing the user to communicate using speech output. Such devices are known as speech generating devices (SGD) or voice output communication aids (VOCA). A device's speech output may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play recorded words or phrases and are generally more intelligible while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can be harder to understand but that permits the user to spell words and speak novel messages.\n\nHigh-tech systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated devices such as computers that run additional software to allow them to function as AAC devices. They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed manually. To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels. On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.\n\nHigh-tech devices vary in the amount of information that they can store, as well as their size, weight and thus their portability. Access methods depend on the abilities of the user, and may include the use of direct selection of symbols on the screen or keyboard with a body part, pointer, adapted mice or joysticks, or indirect selection using switches and scanning. Devices with voice output offer its user the advantage of more communicative power, including the ability to initiate conversation with communication partners who are at a distance. However, they typically require programming, and tend to be unreliable.\n\nHigh-tech systems can also include Keyboard based solutions that do not require programming with a mix of flexibility, simplicity, and associated reliability. In this case, a keyboard and audio speaker are configured to be create a \"\"talking keyboard\"\" where typed text is spoken directly in an audio speaker. This allows any phrase to be spoken as it is typed using unlimited vocabulary text-to-speech conversion. One simple benefit is that a talking keyboard, when used with a standard telephone or speakerphone can enable a voice impaired individual have 2 way conversation over a telephone.\n\nIn all cases of use, low tech systems often recommended as a backup in case of device failure.\n\nSymbols are visuals used to represent objects, actions, and concepts through the use of items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols. Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). LAMP Words for Life, a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.\n\nTechnological advances have dramatically increased the types of selection methods available for individuals with communication impairments. \nIn \"Direct Selection\", the selection is made by pointing to the desired symbol using a finger or an alternative pointer, such as eye gaze, a head stick, head- or eye-controlled mouse. To accommodate motor control difficulties some users use alternative activation strategies; for example in \"timed activation\", the user maintains selection of the symbol for a predetermined period of time until it is recognized by the system. With the \"release activation\", the selection of the item is only made when the person releases contact from the display.\n\nDirect activation of an AAC system is generally the first choice of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier. Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or \"scanning\". In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as a switch, vocalization or gesture. Several different patterns for switch access scanning are available: in \"circular scanning\", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In \"linear scanning\", items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in \"group-item scanning\", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected.\n\nThere are three main selection control techniques in scanning. In \"automatic scanning\", the scan proceeds at a pre-determined speed and pattern until the user selects an item. In \"inverse scanning\", the switch is held down to advance the scan, and released to choose the desired iem. In \"step scanning\", the AAC user activates one switch to move the indicator through the items, and another switch to select the item.\n\nVocabulary organization refers to the way pictures, words, phrases, and sentences are displayed on the communication system. In general, the goal is to facilitate efficient and effective communication, especially when the individual's AAC system contains a large number of symbols.\n\nCommunication books and devices are often presented in a grid format; the vocabulary items displayed within them may be organized by spoken word order, frequency of usage or category. In the Fitzgerald Key organization, symbols from different semantic and syntactic classes are organized grammatically in groups from left to right to facilitate sentence construction. Since research has shown that children and adults use a small number of words frequently, in a core-fringe vocabulary organization, the words and messages that are communicated most frequently appear on a \"main page\". The fringe vocabulary—words and messages used more rarely and that are specific to an individual—appear on other pages. Symbols may also be organized by category, grouping people, places, feelings, foods, drinks, and action words together. Another form of grid organization groups vocabulary according to specific activities. Each display contains symbols for the people, places, objects, feelings, actions, and other relevant vocabulary items for a specific activity or routine.\nVisual scene displays are a different method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience. They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary that is associated with specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication. Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.\n\nAugmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech, with users generally producing 8–10 words per minute. Rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output to around 12–15 words per minute, and as a result enhance the efficiency of communication. There are two main options for increasing the rate of communication: encoding and prediction.\n\nEncoding is a technique permitting an AAC user to produce an entire word, sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their AAC system. In numeric, alpha-numeric, and letter encoding (also known as abbreviation-expansion), words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing \"HH\" may retrieve \"Hello, how are you?\". In iconic encoding strategies, such as Semantic compaction, icons (picture symbols) are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases.\n\nPrediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. Word prediction software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.\n\nAn evaluation of an individual's abilities, limitations and communication needs is necessary to select appropriate AAC techniques. The purpose of the assessment is to identify potential AAC approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user's current communication and their present and future communication needs. AAC evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, rehabilitation engineer, physiotherapist, social worker and a physician. Users, family members and teachers are also key members of the decision making team. Sensitivity to and respect of cultural diversity contributes to ongoing family involvement and to the selection of the most appropriate AAC system. For members of some cultural groups the presence of an AAC device increases the visibility of disability and is thus viewed as stigmatizing.\n\nA user's motor abilities, communication skills and needs, cognition and vision are assessed in order to determine the most appropriate match to a communication system. Depending on the individual's physical status, recommendations of an alternative access method, a change in seating/positioning, a mounting system and/or communication aid adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with spastic arm movements may require a key guard on top of the keyboard or touchscreen to reduce the selection of non-target items. The person's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social purposes. Researcher Janice Light identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as \"please\" and \"thank you\". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family. In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices. However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct, and influence family attitudes towards AAC.\n\nTraining can help the user make use of their AAC system to communicate effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language as well as the linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.\n\nCommunication partners may also require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly because there is a danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.\nYoung AAC users benefit from rich language and literacy experiences to foster vocabulary development, discourse skills, and phonological awareness, all of which supports successful literacy learning. Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child, such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate, including using the individual's communication system themselves. They also benefit from focussed and explicit reading instruction.\n\nSeveral reviews have found that the use of AAC does not impede the development of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact, may result in modest gains being observed. A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change. A descriptive review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.\n\nResearchers hypothesize that using an AAC device relieves the pressure of having to speak, allowing the individual to focus on communication, and that the reduction in psychological stress makes speech production easier. Others speculate that in the case of speech generating devices, the model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production.\n\nLanguage and literacy have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and social interaction in a variety of settings. Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities. Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax, and impaired pragmatic skills. These delays may be due in part to the fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities. Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development, but environmental factors also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood. Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities. Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.\n\nAccording to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report less than 10% of severely disabled individuals were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors that have been found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others. Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management, problem solving, communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.\n\nSeveral studies of young adults who had used AAC since childhood report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to lack of access to appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.\n\nCerebral palsy is a term referring to a non-progressive developmental neuromotor disorder with an upper motor neuron lesion origin. Depending on the location of the brain lesion, individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges, including different forms and areas of the body affected. Fine motor planning, control and coordination are often affected. Dysarthria, a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual and hearing problems are also common. Gross and fine motor challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device. Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement. Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use. The trend towards custom-placed sensors and personalized signal processing may assist in facilitating communication for those who are incapable of using other AAC technologies.\n\n Individuals with intellectual impairments face challenges in developing communication skills, including problems with generalization (the transfer of learned skills into daily activities). They may lack communication opportunities in their daily lives, and responsive communicators who understand their communication methods. AAC intervention for this population emphasizes partner training as well as opportunities for integrated, natural communication. Studies have shown that appropriate use of AAC techniques with children and adults with intellectual impairments can enhance communication skills, increase participation in activities, choice-making, and even influence the perceptions and stereotypes of communication partners.\n\nWhile most individuals with intellectual disabilities do not have concomitant behavioural issues, problems in this area are typically more prevalent in this population than others. AAC approaches may be used as part of teaching functional communication skills to non-speaking individuals as an alternative to \"acting out\" for the purpose of exerting independence, taking control, or informing preferences.\n\nAutism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills. People with autism have been found to have strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.\nAAC intervention in this population is directed towards the linguistic and social abilities of the child, including providing the person with a concrete means of communication, as well as facilitating the development of interactional skills.\n\nAAC systems for this population generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those with little or no functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.\n\nDevelopmental verbal dyspraxia, also known as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a developmental motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech of a child with developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.\n\nA wide variety of AAC systems have been used with children with developmental verbal dyspraxia. Manual signs or gestures are frequently introduced to these children, and can include the use of fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation. Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices. A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child can take advantage of the most effective method for a particular situation.\n\nTraumatic brain injury can result in severe motor speech disorders; dysarthria is the most common such disorder, accounting for roughly a third of all cases. Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition. Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information.\n\nAphasia is the result of damage to the brain's language centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment. Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.\n\nDepending on their language and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards. Visual scene displays have been used on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction. Approaches such as \"Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia\" train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe. They can be produced at a very low tech level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words they are trying to say. Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.\n\nStrokes that occur in the brainstem may cause profound deficits, including locked-in syndrome, in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice. The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements are most likely to be preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication. Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with motor control, vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements, which can be used to access a communication device.\n\n amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND) is a progressive condition which leads to weakness and eventual paralysis. Approximately 75% of people with ALS are unable to speak by the time of their death. In a procedure known as voice banking, people with ALS may digitally record words and phrases while still able to do so, for later inclusion in a communication device. AAC systems used typically change over time depending on severity of speech impairment, physical status, and the individual's communication needs. Use of augmentative communication strategies generally begins when speaking rate drops to 100 words per minute. In the early stages, AAC may consist of using an alphabet board to cue the listener to the first letter of the word being spoken, and may be used with those less familiar with the individual. In the later stages, AAC often becomes the main communicative method, although familiar conversation partners may still understand some spoken words. Since cognition and vision are typically unaffected in ALS, writing-based systems are preferred to graphic symbols, as they allow the unlimited expression of all words in a language.\n\nThe method of access to a communication device depends on the type and severity of the disease. In the spinal form of ALS, the limbs are affected from the onset of the disease; in these cases a head mouse or eye tracking access may be used initially. In the bulbar form, speech is affected before the limbs; here handwriting and typing on keyboard-style devices are frequently the first forms of AAC. AAC users may change access methods as the disease progresses. Low-tech systems, such as eye gazing or partner assisted scanning, are used in situations when electronic devices are unavailable (for example, during bathing) and in the final stages of the disease.\n\nParkinson's disease is a progressive neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, may be used to increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.\n\nDysarthria is the most common communication problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.\n\nDementia is an acquired, chronic, cognitive impairment\ncharacterized by deficits in memory and other cognitive domains. Communication impairments are partly attributed to memory deficits, and AAC intervention may be used to compensate for deficits and to capitalize on the person's strengths, such as the ability to recognize material they cannot recall. Low-tech devices are generally preferred, such as memory books that include autobiographical information, daily schedules, photographs, and reminders or labels. Several studies have shown positive outcomes in the amount of on-topic conversation and the length of interaction with these approaches. The gains were maintained four months after the training in the use of the memory aids had ceased. High-tech devices with voice output have been found to be less effective; in one study devices resulted in limited topic elaboration/initiation, reduced output and heightened distraction. AAC is also used to enhance the comprehension of those with dementia. The use of augmented listening strategies, such as identifying topics of conversation with pictures, improves the conversational skills of individuals with dementia.\n\nThe history of AAC can be traced to the days of classical Rome and Greece, with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf. The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by Native Americans to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in Minneapolis.\n\nThe modern era of AAC began in the 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several societal changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device in the form of a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom the 1960s onward, sign language increased in acceptance and use in the Deaf community, and AAC also came to be viewed as acceptable for those with other diagnoses. Manual sign languages, such as Makaton, were advocated for those with both hearing and cognitive impairments, and later for those with intellectual impairment or autism with normal hearing. Research into whether primates could learn to sign or use graphic symbols spurred further interest the use of AAC with those with cognitive impairments. The use of Amer-Ind hand signals opened the field to AAC techniques specifically for adult users.\n\nBlissymbols were first used in Canada in 1971 to provide communication to those not able to use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By the end of the 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.\n\nThe late 1970s and 1980s saw a massive increase of AAC-related research, publications, and training as well the first national and international conferences. The International Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since played an important role in developing the field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in developing countries. AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists. At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations.\n\nFrom the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.\n\nThe 1990s brought a focus on greater independence for people with disabilities, and more inclusion in mainstream society . In schools, students with special needs were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class. Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the classroom with the teacher, rather than in a therapy room. Facilitated communication – a method by which a facilitator guides the arm of a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field. However, it has been demonstrated that the facilitator rather than the disabled person is the source of the messages generated in this way. Consequently, professional organizations and researchers and clinicians have rejected the method as a pseudoscience.\n\nRapid progress in hardware and software development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards. High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some can be used as environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.\nFuture directions for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing the cognitive and linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction. AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use. The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies has the potential to radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices; however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. Android and other open source operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required. Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development. Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions. Natural language generation techniques have been investigated, including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners, data from a user's schedule and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches, as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors. However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: \"The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2106978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106978", "title": "Culture of Ethiopia", "text": "Culture of Ethiopia\n\nThe culture of Ethiopia is diverse and generally structured along ethnolinguistic lines. The country's Afro-Asiatic-speaking majority adhere to an amalgamation of traditions that were developed independently and through interaction with neighbouring and far away civilizations, including other parts of Northeast Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, India, Italy and Malaysia. By contrast, the nation's Nilotic communities and other ethnolinguistic minorities tend to practice customs more closely linked with South Sudan and/or the African Great Lakes region.\n\nThe music of Ethiopia is extremely diverse, with each of the country's ethnic groups being associated with unique sounds. Some forms of traditional music are strongly influenced by folk music from elsewhere in the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia. However, ring the reign of Gabra Masqal. In northeastern Ethiopia, in Wollo, a Muslim musical form called \"manzuma\" developed in 1907. Sung in Amharic, manzuma has spread to Harar and Jimma, where it is now sung in the Oromo language. In the Ethiopian Highlands, traditional secular music is played by itinerant musicians called \"azmari\" (Zageth), who are regarded with both suspicion and respect in Ethiopian society. \n\nIn the highlands, traditional string instruments include the \"masenqo\" (also known as masinko), a one-string bowed lute; the \"krar\" (also known as kirar), a six-string lyre; and the \"begena\", a large ten-string lyre. The \"dita\" (a five-string lyre) and musical bows (including an unusual three-string variant) are among the chordophones found in the south. Also \"kebero\" ( a drum) used by the religious group like Orthodox's or other Christian religious group to praise what they believe in.\n\nThe washint is a bamboo flute that is common throughout or in the highlands. Trumpet-like instruments include the ceremonial \"malakat\" used in some regions, and the \"holdudwa\" (animal horn; compare shofar) found mainly in the south. Embilta flutes have no finger holes, and produce only two tones, the fundamental and a fourth or fifth interval. These may be metal (generally found in the north) or bamboo (in the south). The Konso and other people in the south play fanta, or pan flutes.\n\nIn the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, liturgical music employs the senasel, a sistrum. Additionally, the clergy will use prayer staffs, or \"maqwamiya\", to maintain rhythm. Rural churches historically used a \"dawal\", made from stone slabs or pieces of wood, in order to call the faithful to prayer. The Beta Israel use a small gong called a \"qachel\" as liturgical accompaniment, though qachel may also refer to a small bell. The toom, a lamellophone, is used among the Nuer, Anuak, Majangir, Surma, and other Nilo-Saharan groups. Metal leg rattles are common throughout the south.\n\nThe kebero (ከበሮ) is a large hand drum used in the Orthodox Christian liturgy. Smaller kebero drums may be used in secular celebrations. The \"nagarit\" (ነጋሪት), played with a curved stick, is usually found in a secular context such as royal functions or the announcement of proclamations, though it has a liturgical function among the Beta Israel. The Gurage and other southern peoples commonly play the \"atamo\", a small hand drum sometimes made of clay.\n\nEthiopia is a musically traditional country. Popular music is played, recorded and listened to, but most musicians also sing traditional songs, and most audiences choose to listen to both popular and traditional styles. A long-standing popular musical tradition in Ethiopia was that of brass bands, imported from Jerusalem in the form of forty Armenian orphans (Arba Lijoch) during the reign of Haile Selassie. This band, which arrived in Addis Ababa on September 6, 1924, became the first official orchestra of Ethiopia. By the end of World War II, large orchestras accompanied singers; the most prominent orchestras were the Army Band, Police Band, and Imperial Bodyguard Band. Most of these bands were trained by Europeans or Armenians.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, Ethiopian popular musicians included Bizunesh Bekele, Mahmoud Ahmed, Alemayehu Eshete, Hirut Bekele, Ali Birra, Ayalew Mesfin, Kiros Alemayehu, Muluken Melesse and Tilahun Gessesse, while popular folk musicians included Alemu Aga, Kassa Tessema, Ketema Makonnen, Asnaketch Worku, and Mary Armede. Perhaps the most influential musician of the period, however, was Ethio-jazz innovator Mulatu Astatke. Amha Records, Kaifa Records, and Philips-Ethiopia were prominent Ethiopian record labels during this era. Since 1997, Buda Musique's \"Éthiopiques\" series has compiled many of these singles and albums on compact disc.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Derg controlled Ethiopia, and emigration became almost impossible. Musicians during this period included Ethio Stars, Wallias Band and Roha Band, though the singer Neway Debebe was most popular. He helped to popularize the use of Sem ena Worq (wax and gold, a poetic form of double entendre) in music (previously only used in qiné, or poetry) that often enabled singers to criticize the government without upsetting the censors.\n\nPopular musicians from Ethiopia include internationally renowned and recognized artists such as the Los Angeles–area expatriate Aster Aweke, The Weeknd and Teddy Afro, who is often accredited with the fusion of Rastafarian styles into mainstream Ethiopian music. More recently, music from Tigray and Eritrea has become popular in Ethiopia and among exiles, especially in Italy. One of the biggest new trends, however, has been the rise of bolel, a sort of blues-like music, played by sarcastic azmari playing in parts of Addis Ababa, especially Yohannès Sefer and Kazentchis. Bolel musicians include Tigist Assefa, Tedje and Admassou Abate.\n\nCurrently the most prominent Ethiopian singer internationally is Gigi. Through her performing with top jazz musicians such as Bill Laswell (who is also her husband) and Herbie Hancock, Gigi has brought Ethiopian music to popular attention, especially in the United States, where she now lives.\n\nOther popular performers include Tewodros Tadesse, Neway Debebe, Tadesse Alemu, Hamelmal Abate, Martha Ashagari, Yohannes Berhanu, Kuku Sebsebe, Aster Aweke, and Manalemosh Dibo. Neway was very popular among the youth of the 1980s and early 1990s with such songs as \"Yetekemt Abeba,\" \"Metekatun Ateye,\" \"Safsaf,\" and \"Gedam,\" among others. Abatte Barihun has exemplified all four main qenets on his 2005 album Ras Deshen.\n\n\"Éthiopiques\" producer Francis Falceto criticizes contemporary Ethiopian music for eschewing traditional instruments and ensemble playing in favor of one-man bands using synthesizers. Harvard University professor Kay Kaufman Shelemay, on the other hand, maintains that there is genuine creativity in the contemporary music scene. She further points out that Ethiopian music is not alone in shifting to electronically produced music, a point that Falceto acknowledges.\n\nIn some central and northern areas, women's traditional clothes are often made from cloth called \"shemma\". It is basically cotton cloth, about 90 cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the fabric for an elegant effect. It takes about two to three weeks to make enough cloth for one dress. The bottom of the garment or shirt may be ornamented with patterns.\n\nMen wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white collar, and perhaps a sweater. They also frequently wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the \"netela\". The shawls are worn in a different style for different occasions. When going to church, women cover their hair with them and pull the upper ends of the shawl about their shoulders reproducing a cross (\"meskelya\"), with the shiny threads appearing at the edge. During funerals, the shawl is worn so the shiny threads appear at the bottom (\"madegdeg\"). Women's dresses are called \"habesha kemis\", and are often made from the shemma cloth. The dresses are usually white with some color above the lower hem. Bracelets and necklaces of silver or gold are worn on arms and feet to complete the look. A variety of designer dinner dresses combining traditional fabric with modern style are now worn by some ladies in the cities.\n\nThese traditional clothes are still worn on a day-to-day-basis in the countryside. In cities and towns, western clothes are popular. However, on special occasions such as New Year (\"Enkutatash\"), Christmas (\"Genna\") or weddings, some wear traditional clothes.\n\nOften, a woman will cover her head with a \"shash\", a cloth that is tied at the neck. \"Shama\" and \"kuta\", gauze-like white fabrics, are often used. This is common among both Muslim and Christian women. Elderly women will wear a sash on a day-to-day basis, while other women only wear a sash also called a \"netela\" while attending church.\n\nThe Ethiopian cuisine consists of various vegetable or meat side dishes and entrees, often prepared as a \"wat\" or thick stew. One or more servings of wat are placed upon a piece of injera, a large sourdough flatbread, which is 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour. One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera (always with the right hand) to scoop up the entrees and side dishes. Traditional Ethiopian food does not use any pork or seafood (aside from fish), as most Ethiopians have historically adhered to Islam, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, or Judaism, all of which prohibit eating pork and shellfish. Additionally, throughout a given year, Orthodox Christians observe numerous fasts (such as Lent), during which food is prepared without any meat or dairy products. Another dish served in Ethiopia is Doro wat, which is chicken stew with hard boiled eggs.\n\nTrack and field is Ethiopia's most successful sport, in which they have won many medals in the Olympic Games. Football is the most popular sport in Ethiopia. Despite lack of success by the national team, it is supported by a significant part of the population.\n\nRadio and television are under the control of the Ethiopian government. There are nine radio broadcast stations, eight AM and one shortwave, licensed to operate. The major radio broadcasting stations (all AM) are Radio Ethiopia, Radio Torch (pirate), Radio Voice of One Free Ethiopia, and the Voice of the Revolution of Tigray. Television viewing has increased over the years and today there are a number of channels streamed via satellite television, such as Fana TV, EBS, Gospel TV, ETV 57 (government-owned), Kana TV, OMN, DM TV, and many more. In keeping with government policy, radio broadcasts occur in a variety of languages. Print media, because of high poverty levels, low literacy rates, and poor distribution outside of the capital, serve only a small portion of the population. Major daily newspapers include \"Addis Zemen\", the \"Daily Monitor\", and the \"Ethiopian Herald\". There is also a small but lively film industry.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, there are ninety individual languages spoken in Ethiopia. Most people in the country speak Afro-Asiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches. The former includes Oromiffa, spoken by the Oromo people, and Somali, spoken by the Somali people; the latter includes Amharic, spoken by the Amhara people, and Tigrinya, spoken by the Tigray-Tigrinya people. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afro-Asiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic Sidamo, Afar, Hadiyya and Agaw languages, as well as the Semitic Gurage, Harari, Silt'e and Argobba tongues.\n\nAdditionally, Omotic languages are spoken by Omotic ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions. Among these idioms are Aari, Bench, Dawro, Dime, Dizi, Gamo, Gofa, Maale, Hamer and Wolaytta.\n\nLanguages from the Nilo-Saharan phylum are also spoken by the nation's Nilotic ethnic minorities, who are concentrated in the southwestern parts of the country. These tongues include Nuer, Anuak, Nyangatom, Majang, Surma, Me'en and Mursi.\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken foreign language and is the medium of instruction in secondary schools. Amharic was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromiffa, Somali or Tigrinya. While all languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia, Amharic is recognized as the official working language of the Federal Government. The various regions of Ethiopia are free to determine their own working languages, with Oromiffa, Somali and Tigrinya recognized as official working languages in their respective regions.\n\nIn terms of writing systems, Ethiopia's principal orthography is Ge'ez or Ethiopic. Employed as an abugida for several of the country's languages, it first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language. Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches. Other writing systems have also been used over the years by different Ethiopian communities. The latter include Sheikh Bakri Sapalo's script for Oromo.\n\nAbout 40% of the population adhere to Christianity\n\n. About 55% of the population are Muslim, with other religions covering another 5%.\n\nIn rural and urban Ethiopia, the senior male of the household has the majority of authority. Men in the country side are in charge of the more intense labor such as plowing, trading, building, and harvesting. Women are more responsible for the domestic labor of the household such as cooking, collecting goods, and caring for the household. It is also not unusual to see women helping men with some tasks in the countryside. In the urban areas, traditional gender roles are less common, but the women are, more often than not, still in charge of domestic labor. In Ethiopia education is still stressed more for boys compared to girls and also given more leeway to social activities over girls, though enrollment rate for girls in education is on the rise.\n\nThere are a number of public holidays in Ethiopia. Among these holidays are Meskel and Ramadan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2106999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2106999", "title": "Chief Surgeon Who?", "text": "Chief Surgeon Who?\n\n\"Chief Surgeon Who?\" is the fourth episode of the television series \"M*A*S*H\". It was first broadcast on October 8, 1972 and was repeated twice, on April 15 and July 29, 1973. It was written by Larry Gelbart, who won a Writers Guild Award for it, and directed by E.W. Swackhamer. This episode marks the first appearance of Jamie Farr as Corporal Klinger. In \"Watching M*A*S*H, Watching America\", a sociological examination of \"M*A*S*H\" as an illustration of shifting American values in the 1970s and early 1980s, James H. Wittebols cites this episode as an example of the satirizing of hypocritical authority figures. \n\nAfter complaints about the surgeons' practical jokes during surgical sessions, Col. Blake decides to appoint a chief surgeon. Despite protests from Majors Burns and Houlihan, he chooses Hawkeye. In retaliation, the majors bring a General to the camp to inspect Hawkeye's work.\n\nAfter a long O.R. session, Major Burns complains to Col. Blake that the surgeons respect Hawkeye more than him, even though Burns outranks him. In response, Col. Blake appoints Hawkeye as chief surgeon, to consult on all shifts. Burns is furious over the choice, believing that the position should be determined by rank and that, as the highest ranking surgeon (and the unit's second-in-command), he should automatically receive the position. Blake refuses to reconsider, reminding Burns that Hawkeye has two specialty certifications and that he performs better when \"the heat's on\". An angry Burns promises to bring plenty of heat to his commanding officer, and he and Major Houlihan go over his head to General Bradley Barker in the hopes that he will overrule Blake and name Burns the chief surgeon.\n\nThe general arrives just after the entire camp, with the exception of the two majors, have thrown a massive party for Hawkeye, and are now finishing off with sex, drinking, and gambling. Major Burns informs him that a badly wounded patient has been waiting in surgery for half an hour while Hawkeye is playing poker. When the general confronts Hawkeye, he orders him to perform the surgery. Hawkeye refuses, explaining to Barker that when the patient came into the 4077th, his condition made him too great a risk to operate immediately. Hawkeye also informs the general that he will not perform the operation until the patient is stabilized unless an emergency arises and that Barker is free to take over treatment if he desires.\n\nFurious at Hawkeye's perceived insubordination, Barker storms across the compound looking for Col. Blake. He proceeds to inspect the entire camp and finds disrespect for military authority at every turn, including Corporal Klinger, who is wearing a dress while on guard duty. By the time he finds Blake, Hawkeye has gone to the OR and Barker asks him about the condition of his patient. Hawkeye responds by telling Barker the patient is stable and ready for surgery. As Barker observes the surgery, he realizes Hawkeye is more than qualified for his chief surgeon position and that his choice to wait to operate was the right decision. For this reason, he drops all the charges he had intended to press. General Barker also advised Col. Blake to give Major Burns \"a high colonic and send him on a ten mile hike\" as a punishment for Burns and Houlihan calling him to the 4077th and wasting his time. \n\nLater on Burns is operating and asks Hawkeye to assist. Hawkeye walks over and says to Frank, \"I'm ready, doctor.\". \n"}

The parish includes the hamlets of Churchinford and Burnworthy where Burnworthy Lodge dates from the 16th century and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.\n\nThe village was known as \"Cheristone\" meaning \"stony settlement where cherries grow\", in the 13th century.\n\nUntil 1896 the village was within Hemyock Hundred in the county of Devon. It was then transferred into Somerset.\n\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\n\nThe village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of Taunton Deane, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Taunton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.\n\nSomerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.\n\nIt is also part of the Taunton Deane county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.\n\nState Education for the children of the village up to aged 11 is provided by a Somerset County Council Primary School. Churchstanton Primary School. State Secondary education for the Somerset children is provided at The Castle School in Taunton or for the Devon children, Uffculme Secondary School. As with may small primary schools the pressure is on the Governors to join an Academy trust. There are a number of potential suitors locally, including The Castle Partnership Trust (Taunton / Wellington) or the Redstart Academies Trust (Chard). See external link to Churchstanton Primary School below for access to Governors meeting notes\n\nThe people of the Parish and adjoining area own and manage a successful Community Shop. In addition to selling local produce, it has a Post office counter service, alcohol licence and a coffee shop. There is a public open space on the edge of the village which is managed by a committed group of volunteers. The area provides recreational facilities for residents to play field games, walk, picnic and have an allotment.\nThere is a Village Hall, again run by volunteers. The hall is used for community events and meetings as well as being available to rent for private events and entertainment. Periodically films are shown and there is a monthly produce market.\n\nQuants Reserve is a nature reserve north west of the village which consists of a grassland clearing in a forestry plantation. It is well known for its butterflies — among the species which occur are Duke of Burgundy, marsh fritillary and wood white. In 1988 an area of 50.6 hectares (126.0 acres) was designated as a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nRingdown is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest where outcrops of both Cretaceous Upper Greensand and underlying Triassic Keuper Marls occur. Amongst the vegetation present are two species which are very restricted in South West Britain, white beaksedge (\"Rhynchospora alba\") and dioecious sedge (\"Carex dioica\"). This site is the only known location for the latter in Somerset. A colony of the small pearl-bordered fritillary (\"Boloria selene\") is found here.\n\nTo the east of Churchinford village lies a local nature reserve set around two lakes f the former landscaped gardens of Otterhead House which was demolished in 1952. The estate was developed in Victorian times and by 1890 included over 1700 acres of land. The Reserve was designated as a LNR in 2008. It is managed and leased from Wessex Water by the not for profit Otterhead Estate Trust Co Ltd. The company was set up in 2008 to conserve and part restore the built heritage features on site as well as continuing the work of the Somerset wildlife Trust who used to manage the reserve.\n\nThe main feature of the LNR is the valley of the River otter, in which the former Victorian estate had created a flight of five lakes and a complicated system of leats, weirs and pumps. Today only two of the lakes survive.\n\nA range of semi-natural habitats make up the reserve including alder and willow carr, dry deciduous woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and freshwater streams and ditches. Dormice, badgers and bat species occur in the woodland. The lakes supports bird species including kingfisher, dipper and wagtail. \nVisitors should keep to clearly visible paths as dangerous deep silt is found in former lakebeds and leats. Naturally occurring spring line mires can be equally dangerous to everyone though small children and dogs would be particularly at risk if leaving the visible paths. Please remember that the lakes provide drinking water for Taunton and that nesting birds will be present in the woodland during summer months and dogs should be kept on a lead.\n\nThe parish Church of St Peter and St Paul dates from the 14th century and has been designated as a grade I listed building.\n\n"}

Parts of Lower Austria can also be seen from \"Stefaniewarte\" at the peak. Next to Stefaniewarte is a 165-meter high steel tower that serves as the transmitter for the ORF, the Austrian Broadcast Corporation. Two terraces are located on the mountain: one at a small church called St. Josef and one at a restaurant built in the 1930s by architect Erich Boltenstern. Parts of the restaurant and a nearby abandoned hotel have been torn down and replaced by a modern restaurant and MODUL University Vienna, a private university established in 2007, focusing on Social and Economic Development, in particular in the areas of tourism, information technology and public governance. The demolition was opposed by the local historical society and by some architects who believed the building was worth protecting. There is also a spiritual recovery center and a center for a Catholic reform movement, the Schönstattbewegung Österreich.\n\nKahlenberg is 484 meters high and lies in the northeastern foothills of the Eastern Alps. The mountain is mostly flysch, which is composed of quartz, limestone, marl, and other conglomerates. East of Kahlenberg is Leopoldsberg; and to the west are Reisenberg, Latisberg, and Hermannskogel.\n\nKahlenberg (German: bald mountain) was uninhabited until the 18th century. Originally, the mountain was called \"Sauberg\" (sow mountain) or \"Schweinsberg\" (pig mountain), after the numerous wild pigs that lived in the pristine oak forests. In 1628, Ferdinand II acquired the mountain from the Klosterneuburg monastery and called it \"Josephsberg\" (Joseph's Mountain). Only after Emperor Leopold I renamed the original Kahlenberg (the neighbouring mountain) to Leopoldsberg was the name \"Kahlenberg\" given to the \"Josephsberg\".\n\nAfter acquiring the mountain, Ferdinand II allowed a hermitage for the Kamaldulenser, an order of Catholic hermits, to be built. A few houses were built around the Chapel of Saint Joseph, which earned the name Josefsdorf. \n\nJan III Sobieski, King of Poland launched his attack on the Turkish forces during the second siege of Vienna from here. The Turkish name of the mountain is \"Alamandağı\".\n\nThe mountain is also notable as the place where Albert Einstein, Otto Neurath, and other mathematicians and physicists made the first plans, around 1920, for what would later become the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science.\n\nKahlenberg can be reached by car or by bus (Bus line 38A) via the picturesque Höhenstraße, part of which is cobblestone. The first Austrian cog railway was built to Kahlenberg in 1872 and 1873 and opened in 1874. It was designed by Carl Maader. The track climbed 316 meters over 5.5 km and started from the train station in Nußdorf (today the end station of the tram-line D) and connected through Grinzing and Krapfenwaldl to the Kahlenberg Hotel, which opened in 1872. An average of 180,000 passengers used the train line each year. After World War I, the Vienna municipality converted the trams to electric power. The surrounding citizens had already dismantled large parts of the track during the war. On September 21, 1920, the line was finally shut down.\n\n"}

Following his retirement, he served as a color commentator for the Chicago Fire before later working as a front office executive and manager for both the Fire and Montreal Impact.\n\nKlopas emigrated to the United States from Prosymna, Peloponnese, Greece when he was eight years old and received U.S. citizenship on his 18th birthday. He and his family settled in Chicago, where he attended and played boys soccer, at Mather High School, which he led to the Chicago Public League championship his senior year.\n\nIn 1983, he signed with the Chicago Sting of the North American Soccer League straight out of high school, but an injury led to him missing the team's final outdoor season. Klopas would play for the indoor Sting in the MISL for four seasons. He earned second team All Star honors during the 1986-1987 season. In 1988, Klopas moved to Greece to play with AEK Athens FC. He played four seasons with the team. However, he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in 1991. That injury and a subsequent infection hindered his playing for nearly two years. In 1992, Klopas signed a contract with the U.S. Soccer Federation to play full-time for the United States men's national soccer team. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Klopas returned to Greece and signed with Apollon Athens in 1994 for the remainder of the 1994-1995 season, as well as the 1995-1996 season. He debuted with Apollon against his former Greek club, AEK Athens FC. In 1996, Major League Soccer began developing teams for its inaugural season. In order to ensure an equitable distribution of talent to each team, MLS allocated known players to each team. MLS allocated Klopas to the Kansas City Wizards where he would spend two years. After being sent to the Columbus Crew just before the 1997 MLS Expansion Draft, he was traded in February 1998 to the Chicago Fire for Jason Farrell, who had been selected from the Crew. Klopas would play two years for Chicago before retiring, helping them to the MLS Cup in 1998 and the U.S. Open Cup to complete \"The Double.\" In four years in MLS, Klopas scored 13 goals and added 16 assists. He had six goals and five assists in 40 games—24 starts—for the Fire, including both goals in a 2-0 win over the Tampa Bay Mutiny in the Fire's first ever game at Soldier Field on April 4, 1998. Klopas' most notable goal for the Fire came in Golden Goal overtime of a 2-1 win over the Columbus Crew in the 1998 U.S. Open Cup Final at Soldier Field.\n\nKlopas retired following the 1999 season. He was inducted into Chicago's \"Ring of Fire,\" which celebrates outstanding players and contributors to the organization, in 2004. He was inducted into the Illinois Soccer Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nKlopas made his debut for the U.S. national team in 1987, coming on in a 2-0 Olympic Qualifying loss at Canada on 23 May. Though this was technically his debut for the team, it isn't counted among his senior national team caps as Olympic play is not considered to be of full international status by FIFA even though many of the players that made up the side were full national team players. Klopas was also on the U.S. team at the 1987 Pan American Games. In total, Klopas earned five Olympic team appearances, scoring one goal in a 4-2 qualifying win at El Salvador on October 18, 1987 and helping the team qualify for the 1988 Olympics. Klopas would start and play the full 90 minutes in a 0-0 draw with hosts South Korea and a 4-2 loss to the Soviet Union as the U.S. failed to advance from their group.\n\nKlopas made his full senior team debut when he came on as a halftime substitute for Chico Borja in a 2-0 friendly loss to Colombia in Miami on May 14, 1988. He scored his first two international goals in a 5-1 defeat of Jamaica in St. Louis in the second leg of a home-and-home World Cup qualifying series on August 13, 1988. Despite appearing in seven of 10 U.S. World Cup qualifiers for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Klopas did not make the trip to the team's 1-0 clinching victory over Trinidad & Tobago on November 19, 1989 because head coach Bob Gansler didn't think he was fit enough. Subsequently, he was not included among the 22-man U.S. squad that went to Italy for the tournament.\n\nInjuries and the fact that he was playing abroad in Greece at a time when the National Team was run like a club team limited Klopas to just three caps between 1990-1993. In early 1994, Klopas returned from surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament and began working towards a place on the hosting U.S. side's roster for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Under the guidance of Bora Milutinovic, the U.S. team took on a conservative, defensive approach in the lead-up to the tournament which was also predicated upon the fact that the side didn't have a lot of offensive weapons. Klopas returned to the national team on February 18, coming on as a halftime substitute for Joe-Max Moore in a 1-1 draw with Bolivia in Miami. Over the next few months, he continued to build his fitness up and scored his third international goal in the team's 3-0 friendly win over Moldova on April 20 in Davidson, N.C.\n\nKlopas would go on to score five goals in the eight international friendlies the U.S. played immediately prior to the start of the World Cup, tallying against Iceland, Estonia, Armenia and his native Greece. He also scored a brace in a pre-World Cup friendly against Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on May 22, 1994 and went on to make the U.S. roster.\n\nDespite his recent strike rate, Klopas was left out of the starting 11 for the American's historic 1-1 draw vs. Switzerland and didn't appear in their opening match of the tournament played June 18 at the Pontiac Silverdome. Four days later, Klopas again didn't see the field as the U.S. upset pre-tournament favorites Colombia 2-1 at The Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif, putting the team in a great position to advance to the second round. With the U.S. team earning four of a possible six points from their first two matches, Milutinovic only made one lineup change throughout the group stage. The U.S. team's lack of offense was exposed in the group finale vs. Romania, falling 1-0 but still finishing as one of the tournament's best third place teams, which allowed them to advance to a Round of 16 date with Brazil on July 4.\n\nAfter the lack of scoring chances created against Romania, Milutinovic's decision not to play Klopas was brought into question the day before the Knockout Round match, to which the Serbian manager said, \"\"He can score, but what else?\"\". Klopas responded to Milutinovic's assessment of his play saying, \"\"He said that? I don't know why he would feel that way. I can play wherever he needs me to play. This is the only time I've actually played striker. My five years in Greece, I played midfield and attacker. I'll play any position the team needs me to play. Where I am now, it's not my duty to defend.\"\"\n\nDespite the suspension of starting midfielder John Harkes for the Brazil game and Tab Ramos leaving the game in the first half after catching an elbow from left back Leonardo, Klopas was not used in the match as Hugo Perez replaced Harkes in the starting lineup and Eric Wynalda came on for Ramos. The U.S. held well defensively but were undone by Bebeto's 72nd-minute strike and fell 1-0 to the eventual champions at Stanford Stadium.\n\nDespite not playing in the team's four biggest matches of the year, Klopas played in the team's remaining four friendlies in 1994 and scored three more goals to finish as the U.S. team's top goal scorer that year, tallying eight goals in 15 appearances.\n\nKlopas' swan song with the U.S. team came the following year when he was named to the roster for the 1995 Copa América. He would appear in five of the team's six games and scored the first goal in a 3-0 shocker over Argentina on July 14, 1995, one of the biggest upsets in U.S. Soccer history. He also scored the game-winning goal in the penalty shootout against Mexico in the quarterfinals three days later. Just over a year after being knocked out of the World Cup, the Brazilians were once again responsible for the U.S. team's exit, sending them to a 1-0 semifinal defeat on July 20 in Maldonado, Uruguay. Klopas played in the team's final two friendlies that year, with his final appearance for the U.S. coming as an 80th-minute substitute for Tab Ramos in a 4-3 win over Saudi Arabia on October 8, 1995 in Washington, D.C.\n\nFrom 1988-1995, Klopas amassed 39 senior international caps, scoring 12 goals. At the end of 1995, Klopas sat fourth on the U.S. all-time goal scoring list behind Bruce Murray, Eric Wynalda and Hugo Perez. He now sits 16th on the list and along with Bobby Wood jointly holds the distinction as the U.S. players with the most goals scored without appearing in a FIFA World Cup match.\n\nIn 2000, the Chicago Fire hired Klopas as the team's strength and conditioning trainer. After the 2000 MLS season, he resigned due to personal reasons. In 2004, he was named the head coach and general manager of MISL's expansion franchise Chicago Storm. He led the team to a playoff berth in its second season but resigned in July 2006. In January 2008, he was named the first technical director for the Fire. He was appointed the Fire's interim manager following the dismissal of Carlos de los Cobos in May 2011. Klopas earned his first MLS managerial win in a 1-0 victory over the Columbus Crew thirteen days later on June 12. The Fire finished the season 8-5-10 under Klopas, just missing the playoffs. He managed the Fire through the following two seasons before stepping down after the 2013 season.\n\nIn December 2013, he was named head coach and director of player personnel of the Montreal Impact. After a string of poor performances, he was formally relieved of his duties in late August 2015, and replaced on an interim basis by Mauro Biello.\n\nKlopas lives in Chicago with his wife, Sophia.\nBest friend Is Christos Patsouras studying at UEFA A.\n\nChicago Sting\n\nAEK\n\nChicago Fire\n\nMontreal Impact\n\n"}
{"id": "2107034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2107034", "title": "Feliciano López", "text": "Feliciano López\n\nFeliciano López Díaz-Guerra (; born 20 September 1981) is a Spanish professional tennis player on the ATP Tour. He was born in Toledo and now lives in the Spanish capital, Madrid. López achieved his career-high singles ranking of world No. 12 in March 2015.\n\nIn 2005, he was the first male Spanish tennis player to reach the quarter-finals of Wimbledon since 1972, when Manuel Orantes reached the semi-finals. He repeated the feat in 2008 and 2011. López defeated Tim Henman at the 2007 Wimbledon second round in what would be Henman's last Wimbledon match. Throughout his career, he has played in the most five-set matches that have gone beyond 6–6 in the post-tiebreak era, his longest fifth set being 16–14 at the 2009 Australian Open against Gilles Müller. He reached the quarter-finals of the US Open in 2015, and won his first Grand Slam title at the 2016 French Open when he won the men's doubles title with Marc López. In 2017 at the age of 35 López won the Aegon Championship at The Queen's Club, London, beating Marin Čilić in a third set tiebreak. During the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, López made his 66th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, surpassing the previous record of 65 consecutive appearances held by Roger Federer. As of the 2020 Australian Open, his record stands at 72 consecutive appearances. López also holds the record for most losses on the ATP Tour, with 449.\n\nLópez is left-handed and uses a single-handed backhand. He is known for his strong serve and ability to play balls repeatedly on the baseline, and is also a confident net player and has been known to serve and volley. Unlike most Spanish players, who almost always prefer clay courts due to the popularity of that surface in their country, López is an exceptionally strong grass-court player, with three quarter-final runs at Wimbledon (his strongest Grand Slam showing), as well as 4 titles on grass at the Eastbourne International in 2013 and 2014 and at the Queen’s Club Championships in 2017 and 2019. This is due in part to his more traditional playing style, which is more like grass-court legends Pete Sampras and Roger Federer than fellow Spaniards Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo. This traditional arsenal includes a big serve and a willingness to come into the net.\n\nIn 1997, Feliciano López made his pro circuit debut in Mallorca on 29 September, losing in the second round to Dušan Vemić. In 1998, he made his ATP debut at the 1998 Open SEAT, where he lost to Jiří Novák in the first round. He then competed on the Challenger circuit, making the quarter-finals of Spain F7 and Spain F8. In 1999, he competed on the Futures and Challenger circuits. He won his first Futures event in Spain F6, beating Pedro Canovas in the final. He also reached one other final, losing to Réginald Willems at the Spain F7.\n\nIn 2000, López competed in only his second ATP tournament at the 2000 Estoril Open, losing to Juan Antonio Marín. His performance was mediocre on the Challenger circuit, and he reached only two quarter-finals. The next year was a better one for López, as he won his second Futures event in France F3, defeating Juan Antonio Marín in the final, and reaching the final in Maia, losing to Jarkko Nieminen. He also made his first ATP win in the 2001 Chevrolet Cup, defeating Adrián García. However, he lost the quarter-final to eventual champion Guillermo Coria. He also made his Grand Slam debut at the 2001 French Open, losing to Carlos Moyá in straight sets.\n\nIn 2002, López competed on the ATP circuit regularly. He started the year with his first semi-final at the 2002 ATP Buenos Aires, losing to Nicolás Massú. He followed it up with a quarter-final appearance at the 2002 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships, losing to Antony Dupuis. He also reached the second round of the Miami Masters, losing to Àlex Corretja in the final. He then won his first Grand Slam match at the 2002 French Open, defeating Didac Pérez in five sets, before losing to third seed Tommy Haas in straight sets. In his Wimbledon debut, he reached the fourth round, losing to André Sá four sets, after defeating Guillermo Cañas in five sets with the fifth going to 10–8, in the second round, a match that lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. This was his first win over a top-20 player. He then gained revenge for his loss to Sá by defeating him in López's US Open debut in the first round in straight sets, before losing to Gastón Gaudio in the next round. He then reached the quarter-finals in Hong Kong and Tokyo. In Tokyo, he defeated Marat Safin in the second round, his first win over a top-5 player. He also reached the third round of the 2002 Madrid Masters, losing to Andre Agassi. He ended the year in the top 100 for the first time, at no. 62.\n\nIn 2003, López started the year with first-round exits at Doha and Auckland. He made his Australian Open debut, reaching the third round, but losing to Younes El Aynaoui in four sets. He performed badly in the first rounds in Milan, Marseille, and Rotterdam. He then reached the quarter-finals in Dubai, losing to Tommy Robredo, and in Estoril, losing to Max Mirnyi. He reached the second rounds of Indian Wells and Monte Carlo. In his second French Open, he lost to Mariano Zabaleta in straight sets. He once again reached the fourth round of Wimbledon, where he lost to Roger Federer in straight sets. He then reached two straight semi-finals in Stuttgart and Kitzbühel, losing both to eventual champion Guillermo Coria. He continued his form by reaching the quarter-finals at the 2003 Canada Masters, losing to David Nalbandian in straight sets. After early losses in Cincinnati, Long Island, the US Open, and Moscow, he reached the quarter-finals of Vienna, the Madrid Masters, and Basel. He ended the year with second-round exit at the Paris Masters, where he lost to Guillermo Coria, his fifth lost to Coria. He ended the year ranked no. 28.\n\nIn 2004, López began the year with a 1–3 record, losing in the first rounds of Sydney, the 2004 Australian Open, and Milan, with his only win coming at the Davis Cup. He reached his first final at the 2004 Dubai Open, losing to Roger Federer.

In the 2004 US Open, he reached the third round, before losing to eventual runner-up Lleyton Hewitt. Then at the 2004 Bank Austria-TennisTrophy, he won his first title, defeating Guillermo Cañas in the final. He ended the year with a quarter-final appearance at the 2004 Paris Masters, losing to Guillermo Cañas. He ended the year at world no. 24.\n\nHe started 2005 with quarter-final appearances at the 2005 Qatar ExxonMobil Open, losing to Roger Federer, and at the 2005 Medibank International, losing to Radek Štěpánek. At the 2005 Australian Open, he reached the third round, losing to Joachim Johansson in five sets with the fifth set going to 11–13, in a match that lasted almost four hours. This propelled him to world no. 20 and the semi-finals of 2005 Open 13, once again losing to Joachim Johansson. He then reached the third round of the 2005 Indian Wells Masters, losing to Fabrice Santoro in straight sets, and the quarter-finals of the 2005 Estoril Open, losing to Gastón Gaudio in straight sets.

He then reached the quarter-finals of the 2005 BA-CA Tennis Trophy, losing to Radek Štěpánek in straight sets. He ended the year ranked world no. 34.\n\n2006 was a plateau year for López.

He ended the year at world no. 81, 47 spots lower than the previous year.\n\nIn 2007, López started the year badly, having a 2–5 record in his first five tournaments, managing a win only at the 2007 Australian Open, losing to Novak Djokovic, and at the 2007 SAP Open losing to Vincent Spadea. However, he followed it up with a quarter-final appearance at the 2007 Tennis Channel Open, losing to eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt. He then lost in the second round of the 2007 Indian Wells Masters, losing to eventual semi-finalist Andy Roddick. He reached the fourth round of the 2007 Miami Masters, losing to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. He then followed up with a 1–5 record, with his only win coming in the 2007 Open SEAT over compatriot Guillermo García-López. López reached the third round of the 2007 Wimbledon Championships, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, after he ended Tim Henman's Wimbledon career, beating him in a five-set thriller in the second round, Henman having been two sets up. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2007 Mercedes Cup, losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal. He reached the fourth round of the 2007 US Open, losing to eventual champion Roger Federer, the first set being the fewest games won by Federer in one set in the whole tournament.

He then reached the third round of the 2008 Miami Masters, losing to Dmitry Tursunov. He suffered first-round losses at the next three Masters Series at the 2008 Monte-Carlo Masters, the 2008 Rome Masters, and the 2008 Hamburg Masters.

He then competed in the 2009 Open 13 and made it to the quarter-finals, before losing to eventual champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. López struggled after this, and at one point he suffered eight straight main-draw losses in a row. In the midst of his bad run, he won a title at the Open Castilla y León Challenger event, beating Adrian Mannarino in straight sets. At the inaugural Shanghai Masters, he advanced to his first Master Series semi-final, beating David Ferrer, Jürgen Melzer, and Robin Söderling en route. However, he retired due to a right ankle injury in his semi-final match against Rafael Nadal, trailing 1–6, 0–3. Despite his poor year on the ATP tour, López did play a key role for the Spain Davis Cup team, helping them win the 2009 Davis Cup with doubles wins in the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals.\n\nLópez started his 2010 season by playing in the 2010 Medibank International Sydney, where he lost to eventual runner-up Richard Gasquet in the first round. He then competed in the 2010 Australian Open, where he reached the third round, defeating Pablo Cuevas and Rainer Schüttler, but lost to seventh seed Andy Roddick in a close four-setter. In the 2010 SA Tennis Open as the third seed, he beat Benjamin Balleret, Blaž Kavčič, and Rajeev Ram in the first three rounds, reaching the final after defeating top seed Gaël Monfils in the semi-finals.

He saw off both Yūichi Sugita and Ante Pavić in straight sets in the first and second rounds, respectively. He then met John Isner in the third round. It was a match dominated by serve. López fought back from a set down to win 3 sets to 1, securing the first break of serve in the match in the penultimate game.

This culminated with losses to Thomas Fabbiano in the Monte Carlo qualifying rounds, Fernando Verdasco in Barcelona, Damir Dzumhur in Geneva, and Ivo Karlovic at Roland Garros.\n\nThe grass-court season was much more productive, as he made the round of 16 at Surbiton, losing to Ivo Karlovic, then made the round of 32 at Stuttgart, losing to Lucas Pouille. He then won both the singles and doubles titles at the Queens Club Championships with a three-set singles win over Gilles Simon and a champion tie-break doubles win (partnering with Andy Murray) over Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury.\n\nLópez has appeared as a model for the likes of Hugo Boss and Elle, and endorses Braun shavers and L'Oréal products.

For a short while, he was co-pastor at the Union Chapel with the Rev. Thomas Lewis (1844–1852), but thereafter sole pastor for forty years (1852–92). During this time he gained considerable influence amongst metropolitan Congregationalists and secured the funds required for an ambitious rebuilding programme at the Union Chapel, between 1874 and 1890, from designs by James Cubitt.\n\nIn 1865, Allon became co-editor with Henry Robert Reynolds of the \"British Quarterly Review\", and in 1877, the sole editor of that journal for another ten years.

The film is based on the 1925 romance novel of the same name by Edith Maude Hull, and is a sequel to the 1921 hit film \"The Sheik\", which also stars Rudolph Valentino. \"The Son of the Sheik\" is Valentino's final film and went into general release nearly two weeks after his death from peritonitis at the age of 31.\n\nIn 2003, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\nAt the time of the film's release, Rudolph Valentino was attempting to make a comeback in films. He rose to international stardom after the release of \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" and \"The Sheik\" in 1921, both of which were box office hits and solidified his image as \"the Great Lover\". By 1924, however, Valentino's popularity had begun to wane after he appeared in two box office failures, \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" and \"A Sainted Devil\", both of which featured him in roles that were a departure from his \"Great Lover\" image. He also squabbled over money with Famous Players-Lasky, the studio he was signed to, which eventually led to him walking out on his contract. Famous Players-Lasky eventually released Valentino from his contract and he signed with United Artists in 1925. In an effort to capitalize on the success that Valentino had achieved with \"The Sheik\", United Artists' president Joseph M. Schenck bought the rights to Edith Maude Hull's novel \"Son of the Sheik\" and cast Valentino in the dual role of father and son.\n\nThe novel was adapted for the screen by Frances Marion and Fred de Gresac. The film was shot on location in California and in the Yuma Desert in Arizona.\n\n\"The Son of the Sheik\" opened at the Million Dollar Theater in Los Angeles on July 9, 1926 and played for four weeks.\n\nValentino then embarked on a nationwide tour to promote the film as it rolled out around the first run theatres in the country's cities. On August 15, he collapsed in his New York City hotel room and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors discovered he had a perforated ulcer which required emergency surgery. After the surgery, Valentino developed peritonitis and died on August 23, 1926.\n\n\"The Son of the Sheik\" was put into general release nationwide on September 5, 1926, nearly two weeks after Valentino's death. The film grossed $1,000,000 within the first year of its release. Eventually it more than doubled that.\n\nSome critics have heralded Valentino's performance in the film as one of the best of his career.\n\nImage Entertainment released \"The Son of the Sheik\" along with \"The Sheik\" on DVD in 2002.\n\n\n"}

The station uses a simple island platform setup with two tracks. Architecturally, Hollywood/Highland station shares similarities with other Metro subway stations and the design of the entrance to the station may have been inspired by the entrances of New York City's Times Square – 42nd Street / Port Authority Bus Terminal station.\n\nThe construction designing of the station were teamed up by three different firms. The designer of the station is Sheila Klein, and the constructor of the station is CannonDesign. The lightings, materials, and the mechanical design's responsibility were given to HLB Lighting Design.\n\nThe construction of the station were to be made of equipments given by the Metro, which according to HLB, made it challenging. The lighting pillars of the station was to resemble like a flower, and it was carefully sized to match well with the smooth, curved ceiling which 'resembled a belly'. Sheila Klein named the architecture of the station, \"Underground Girl\".\n\nB Line service hours are approximately from 5:00 AM until 12:45 AM daily.\n\nThe under construction Crenshaw/LAX Line will connect to this station via the future northern extension from the Expo/Crenshaw station (Current terminus) which would offer connections to West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Crenshaw District, Leimert Park, Miracle Mile, City of Inglewood, and LAX.
