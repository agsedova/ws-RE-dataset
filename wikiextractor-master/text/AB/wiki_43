{"id": "1968261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968261", "title": "Pregnancy discrimination", "text": "Pregnancy discrimination\n\nPregnancy discrimination is a type of employment discrimination that occurs when expectant women are fired, not hired, or otherwise discriminated against due to their pregnancy or intention to become pregnant. Common forms of pregnancy discrimination include not being hired due to visible pregnancy or likelihood of becoming pregnant, being fired after informing an employer of one's pregnancy, being fired after maternity leave, and receiving a pay dock due to pregnancy. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women prohibits dismissal on the grounds of maternity or pregnancy and ensures right to maternity leave or comparable social benefits. The Maternity Protection Convention C 183 proclaims adequate protection for pregnancy as well. Though women have some protection in the United States because of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, it has not completely curbed the incidence of pregnancy discrimination. The Equal Rights Amendment could ensure more robust sex equality ensuring that women and men could both work and have children at the same time.\n\nEmployers discriminate on the grounds of pregnancy for a number of reasons:\n\nIn the United States, since 1978, employers are legally bound to provide the same insurance, leave pay, and additional support that would be bestowed upon any employee with medical leave or disability. This only applies to companies with 15 or more employees (including part-time and temporary workers).\n\nWith more than 70% of women with children in the work force, pregnancy discrimination is the fastest growing type of discrimination in the U.S., and in 2006 represented approximately 6.5% of all discrimination claims filed. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mediates claims between employees and employers. In 2006, the EEOC handled 4,901 claims with an eventual monetary pay-out by various organizations totaling $10.4 million.\n\nIn 1978, the U.S. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (P.L. 95-555), an amendment to the sex discrimination section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nIn 2002, California's Paid Family Leave (PFL) insurance program, also known as the Family Temporary Disability Insurance (FTDI) program, extended unemployment disability compensation to cover individuals who take time off work to bond with a new minor child. PFL covers employees who take time off to bond with their own child or their registered domestic partner's child, or a child placed for adoption or foster-care with them or their domestic partner.\n\nVarious U.S. cities have passed additional laws to protect pregnant workers. In 2014, New York City enacted the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act which requires employers offer reasonable accommodations \"to the needs of an employee for her pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition that will allow the employee to perform the essential requisites of the job\". Also in 2014, Philadelphia amended an ordinance which actually compels employers to make reasonable workplace accommodations for female employees \"affected by pregnancy\" meaning pregnant women or women who have medical conditions relating to pregnancy or childbirth. Philadelphia's revised ordinance identifies several possible required accommodations, including restroom breaks, periodic rest for those whose jobs require that they stand for long periods of time, special assistance with manual labor, leave for a period of disability arising from childbirth, reassignment to a vacant position, and job restructuring. In 2015, the Washington D.C. passed the Protecting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act of 2014 which is effective March 3, 2015. In 2018 Massachusetts did the same, with the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act going into effect on April 1, 2018.\n\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and Family and Medical Leave Act are rooted in several major court decisions leading up to them.\n\nIn the 1908 case \"Muller v. Oregon\" the Supreme Court upheld a decision limiting women to 10-hour workdays based on the idea that \"performance of maternal functions\" made women inherently incapable of the same work that men did. In the 1950s and 1960s laws in several states prohibited women from working and banned their hiring for some length of time before and after delivery. In 1971 \"Reed v. Reed\" became the first Supreme Court decision to invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to protect women from discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971 the rights of pregnant schoolteachers were called into question. Many schoolteachers were forced to take unpaid maternity leaves around the fourth to sixth month of pregnancy for the reasons that it was potentially dangerous for the mother or child if the woman continued to work, she might not be able to focus on teaching, and students would be distracted by the visible signs of pregnancy. In 1974 in \"Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur\", the Supreme Court declared mandatory unpaid leave policies unconstitutional. This was a big step towards gaining equal rights for women in the workforce.\n\nTwo other major cases in the 1970s appear to be directly responsible for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The first, \"Geduldig v. Aiello\" (1974), ruled that the exclusion of medical benefits for pregnant women in California by the California State Disability Insurance program was non-discriminatory.\n\nWhile it is true that only women can become pregnant ... the [California State Disability Insurance] program divides potential recipients into two groups- pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second group includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.\n\nIn 1976 \"General Electric v. Gilbert\", 429 U.S. 125, set a similar precedent for private insurance through an employer. The uproar from these two decisions appears to have directly fueled the creation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act by Congress.\n\nIn 2009 the Supreme Court again addressed pregnancy discrimination with their ruling in \"AT&T Corp. v. Hulteen\" that held that maternity leave taken before the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act cannot be considered in calculating employee pension benefits, therefore essentially implying that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is not retroactive.\n\nIn 2014, a bill was passed in hopes of preventing discrimination. It has yet to become a federal law. The Complete Guide To First Trimester of Pregnancy: Symptoms, What To Eat, Signs to Watch for, Baby’s Growth. \n\nThe European Union regards less favourable treatment on grounds of pregnancy as unlawful, and the same thing as discrimination on grounds of sex (contrasting to the American case of \"Geduldig v. Aiello\" and consistent with the American approach in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978).\n\nThe European Court of Justice decided in \"Dekker v Stichting Vormingscentrum Voor Jonge Volwassen (VJV-Centrum) Plus\" that pregnancy discrimination was sex discrimination without any requirement for comparing this unfavourable treatment to a man. It reaffirmed this position in \"Webb v EMO Air Cargo (No 2)\" where a woman had been dismissed because she had attempted to take pregnancy leave, but had not disclosed this to her employer when hired. As well as a dismissal, a failure to renew a fixed term contract may also be discrimination. Furthermore, during any period of pregnancy or maternity leave there may be no detriment or dismissal in connection with a period of sickness. A woman is also allowed to shorten her maternity leave and return to work when she becomes pregnant again to get the second period of pregnancy, even though she is not fully able to carry out all her normal job functions.\n\nIt is also clear that women who are pregnant are protected at job interviews. In the \"Tele Danmark\" case a woman was held not to be at fault for not telling an employer she was pregnant while being interviewed for a job, despite knowing she was pregnant. However, a study published in The Netherlands is 2016 showed that 43% of active women experienced discrimination related to pregnancy of motherhood.\n\nIn Canada, pregnancy discrimination is considered a violation of sex-discrimination laws and will be treated as such.\n\nMexico and Japan have laws to combat pregnancy discrimination.\n\nIn Japan, Labor Standards Act (Act No. 49 of 1947) provides that an employer must provide an expectant mother worker with maternity leave for 6 weeks (14 weeks for multiple pregnancy beyond twins) before her child birth and 8 weeks after the child birth. \nArticle 9 of Equal Employment Opportunity Act between Men and Women (Act No. 113 of July 1, 1972) prohibits unequal employment condition for the reasons of marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave provided in Article 65 of Labor Standards Act and other reasons related childbirth. These unequal employment conditions includes retirement, dismissal. \nIn addition, Act on the Welfare of Workers Who Take Care of Children or Other Family Members Including Child Care and Family Care Leave (Act No. 76 of 1991) provides that employees has the right to take unpaid child care leave for one year, and Article 10 prohibits for an employer to dismiss or disadvantageously treat a worker who have taken or is about to take Child Care Leave. as\nAlthough Maternity Leave and Child Care Leave are basically unpaid leave, Basic Childcare Leave Benefits are provided based on Employment Insurance Act during Child Care Leave and Maternity Allowance and Lump-sum Childbirth Allowance are given based on Health Insurance Act (Act No.70 of 1922). Basic Childcare Leave Benefit is 50% of the employee's wage, and Maternity Allowance is two thirds of the wage. As of 2013, Lump-sum Childcare allowance is ¥420,000 (US$4,075).\n\nIn Hong Kong, it is a criminal offence if an employer discriminates against a pregnant employee if the employee has been hired under a continuous contract. An employer who contravenes this can be liable to prosecution and, on conviction, fined HK$100,000. The employer would also be required to pay the employee's wages in lieu of notice, a further sum equivalent to one month's wages as compensation, and 10-weeks' maternity leave pay. Pregnant workers who feel they have been discriminated against because of their pregnancy are also protected by the Sex Discrimination Ordinance. Despite the law, women may still feel pressured to leave the workforce due to stress.\n\nIn Taiwan, pregnancy discrimination is considered a violation of sex-discrimination laws and are treated as such if an employer is found guilty. Despite the laws, discrimination against women and especially pregnant women is common place as it is rarely reported and discrimination is tolerated.\n\nDiscrimination of pregnant women is the main issue in Cambodia's garment industry. They were misunderstood with lower efficiency, frequent toilet breaks and maternity leave. According to one of the Cambodian female worker \"It doesn't matter whether you are pregnant or not – whether you are sick or not – you have to sit and work. If you take a break, the work piles up on the machine and the supervisor will come and shout. And if a pregnant worker is seen working \"slowly\" then her contract will not be renewed.\"\n\nPregnant women are forced to either leave the factory or go for an abortion. In Cambodia abortion was legalized in 1997, yet 9 out of 10 Cambodian women believed that this action is illegal and undergo this process through unsafe clinics. According to the \"Women's Health Cambodia\", more than 90% of garment workers did not know abortion was legal and 18% out of 900 garment workers had an abortion. Almost 75% of the women do not know where to seek for a safe abortion as there were little information provided to them.\n\nIn Cambodia, there are laws that provide pregnant women three months of maternity leave and maternity pay if the worker has worked for a year or longer. Most of the workers were given a fixed duration contract (FDC) with a 6 month contract period. Often the FDC of pregnant women are shortened as factories do not want to provide extra cost of maternity pays or any other health care.\n\nAustralia has tried to combat the issues of pregnancy discrimination in their workforce. After The United Nations created the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1981, Australia signed in agreement on August 17, 1983. Australia also passed the Sexual Discrimination act of 1984 to help eliminate discrimination in the workplace based on many things including pregnancy discrimination. This legislation doesn't allow or permit the right to base hiring and firing practices on pregnancy or the chance of pregnancy.  The Sexual Discrimination Act also states, \"It is unlawful to refuse the requests to accommodate a pregnant employee. It is also unlawful to accept the request, but take too long to accommodate those needs\"\n\nHowever, it is reported despite the Sexual Discrimination Act of 1984 there are still many cases of work related discrimination based on pregnancy. Nearly one in two women (49%) surveyed by the AHRC reported experiencing pregnancy-related discrimination at work (AHRC, 2014: 26). Australia's government is having a hard time enforcing the Sexual Discrimination Act because employers are arguing that there is no way to prove their actions are based on the pregnancy of their female employees or interviewees. Women have a hard time in court proving that the discrimination was based on pregnancy. Employers can base their choice to pass on a candidate by saying that the women won't be able to perform certain tasks entailed in the job. This action has a hard time being refuted in court because employers can say there was another candidate that was more capable of the tasks and has nothing to do with pregnancy.\n\n\n"}

He worked frequently with his old friend John Gielgud. After working as co-director with Gielgud at the end of the 1930s, he preferred to direct rather than act. He served in the armed forces during the Second World War, and then took leading directorial posts at the Old Vic, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and Sadler's Wells (later known as the English National Opera).\n\nByam Shaw was born in London, the youngest of five siblings (four sons and one daughter) born to artist John Byam Liston Shaw and his wife, Caroline Evelyn Eunice Pyke-Nott (1870–1959), also an artist. He was educated at Westminster School, where his contemporaries included his elder brother, James Byam Shaw, later a well-known art historian, and John Gielgud, who became a lifelong friend and professional colleague.\n\nThe actor Michael Denison, biographer of Byam Shaw in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" writes that Byam Shaw made his professional stage debut in August 1923 with no prior training. Denison speculates that Byam Shaw's cousin, actress May Ward, a close friend of Dame Ellen Terry, \"may have been enough to make him take the plunge\". \"The Times\" said of him, \"Tall, gentle, and graceful in movement, he was valuable in any cast, particularly in classics and in the Russian plays.\"\n\nByam Shaw's first appearance was at Torquay in the west of England, in C. K. Munro's comedy \"At Mrs. Beam's\". In 1925 he made his London debut, playing Yasha in J.B. Fagan's production of \"The Cherry Orchard\", in a cast that included Alan Napier as Gaiev, O.B. Clarence as Firs and Gielgud as the young student Trofimov. Over the next few years Byam Shaw appeared in three more plays by Chekhov, and in plays by Strindberg and Ibsen. He made his New York debut in November 1927 as Pelham Humphrey in \"And So To Bed\".\n\nActress Constance Collier was impressed by Byam Shaw and used her influence to gain him roles. Among those to whom she introduced him was Ivor Novello, then a leading figure in London theatre. She directed them both in the play \"Down Hill\" in 1926. This drew him into contact with the poet Siegfried Sassoon, a friend of Collier; he and Byam Shaw became close. Their friendship lasted for the rest of Sassoon's life, although they ceased to be partners quite quickly; Sassoon became involved with Stephen Tennant, and Byam Shaw fell in love with actress, Angela Baddeley. They married in 1929. The marriage, which lasted until her death in 1976, was, Denison writes, \"a supremely happy one, both domestically and professionally\"; the couple had a son and a daughter.\n\nByam Shaw and Baddeley toured together in South Africa in 1931, in a repertory of three plays. The following year, Byam Shaw appeared at the Lyceum in Max Reinhardt's mime play The Miracle, with Lady Diana Cooper as the Madonna, Tilly Losch as the nun and Leonid Massine as the Spielmann. In 1933, Byam Shaw took over from Gielgud as Richard II in the long-running play \"Richard of Bordeaux\" by 'Gordon Daviot' (Josephine Tey); the following year he played Darnley in another historical play by the same author, \"Queen of Scots\", opposite Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies and Laurence Olivier, directed by Gielgud.\n\nByam Shaw continued to work with Gielgud, playing Laertes to his Hamlet in 1934, and Benvolio in the celebrated 1935 Old Vic production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet and Gielgud and Olivier alternating the roles of Romeo and Mercutio. During that Old Vic season, Gielgud invited Byam Shaw to join him in directing \"Richard II\" for the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Denison, who was in the cast, describes Byam Shaw as \"stimulating, firm, and courteous to his undergraduate cast\". Byam Shaw enjoyed the experience of directing, and never having especially enjoyed acting he turned gladly to direction.\n\nGielgud engaged Byam Shaw to direct Dodie Smith's \"Dear Octopus\" in 1938 with a cast including Gielgud, Marie Tempest, Kate Cutler and Baddeley. Byam Shaw concluded his acting career in the late 1930s in roles including D'Arcy in a dramatisation of \"Pride and Prejudice\", character parts in \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Richard II\", and Sir Benjamin Backbite in \"The School for Scandal\". After appearing in Michel Saint-Denis's short season at the Phoenix Theatre in 1938, his final role was Horatio to Gielgud's Hamlet, both in London and at Elsinore Castle.\n\nAs the Second World War loomed, Byam Shaw joined the emergency reserve of officers. In 1940 he was commissioned into the Royal Scots. He served in Burma from 1942 and was wounded. He ended his military service in 1945 as a major, making training films in India. While in Burma Byam Shaw conceived a production of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" dressed in the costumes of Shakespeare's time, rather than those of Ancient Rome and Egypt. On his return to civilian life, he directed it at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1946, with Godfrey Tearle and Edith Evans. \"The Manchester Guardian\" called his production \"a very adroit and finished piece of work.\"\n\nBetween 1947–51 Byam Shaw was the director of the Old Vic Theatre School, part of the Old Vic Theatre Centre run by Michel Saint-Denis which also included the Young Vic run by George Devine. Denison writes \"Despite much success in all fields the three partners fell foul of the Vic governors and of the theatre's top-heavy and largely hostile administration\". The same board had earlier dismissed Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier as heads of the Old Vic company, and now lost another leading team when Saint-Denis, Devine and Byan Shaw resigned in 1951.\n\nFrom 1952–59 Byam Shaw was director of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, first as co-director with Anthony Quayle, and in sole charge from 1956–59. He was appointed CBE in 1954. He directed 14 plays at Stratford; Denison singles out \"Antony and Cleopatra\" with Michael Redgrave and Ashcroft, \"Macbeth\" with Olivier and Vivien Leigh, \"As You Like It\" with Ashcroft,\"Othello\" with Harry Andrews and Emlyn Williams, and \"King Lear\" with Charles Laughton and Albert Finney. Before the 1950s, Stratford seasons had been widely regarded as worthy but unexciting. Under Quayle and Byam Shaw Stratford became one of the principal centres of British theatre, attracting the leading directors such as Gielgud, Peter Hall and Peter Brook. In 1959, he handed over to Hall, whom he had chosen as his successor.\n\nIn 1962, despite describing himself as tone deaf, Byam Shaw accepted the post of director of productions at Sadler's Wells Opera. He worked closely with the company's managing director, Norman Tucker, and musical director, Colin Davis. Tucker's successor, Lord Harewood, recalled \"a series of striking productions, including \"The Rake's Progress\", \"Così fan tutte\", \"Der Freischütz\" and \"A Masked Ball\" … a notable elegant and witty \"Die Fledermaus\", \"Hansel and Gretel\" … and Gluck's \"Orpheus\".\"\n\nByam Shaw's most celebrated opera productions were in collaboration with the conductor Reginald Goodall, first \"The Mastersingers\", the company's last major production at Sadler's Wells Theatre, and, after its move to the London Coliseum in 1968, the four operas of Wagner's \"Ring\" cycle, in which Byam Shaw's co-director was his former assistant John Blatchley. Byam Shaw's last collaboration with Goodall was \"Tristan and Isolde\" in 1981.\n\nHe was awarded a CBE in 1954 and received an honorary DLitt from the University of Birmingham in 1959.\n\nGlen Byam Shaw died in Goring-on-Thames at the age of 81, survived by his children and extended family, and is buried near his wife at St. Mary's Churchyard, Wargrave, Berkshire.\n"}

It was a laptop comparable in capabilities to desktops of the era.\n\nThe Data General-One offered several features in comparison with contemporary portable computers. For instance, the popular 1983 Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100, a non-PC-compatible machine, was comparably sized. It was a small battery-operated computer resting in one's lap, but had a 40×8 character (240×64 pixel) screen, a rudimentary ROM-based menu in lieu of a full OS, and no built-in floppy. IBM's 1984 Portable PC was comparable in capability with desktops, but was not battery operable and, being much larger and heavier, was by no means a laptop.\n\nThe DG-1 was only a modest success. One problem was its use of 3½\" diskettes. Popular software titles were thus not widely available (5.25\" being still the standard), a serious issue since then-common diskette copy-protection schemes made it difficult for users to copy software into that format.\n\nThe CPU was a CMOS version of the 8086, compatible with the IBM PC's 8088 except it ran slightly slower, at 4.0 MHz instead of the standard 4.77 MHz.\n\nUnlike the Portable PC, the DG-1 laptop could not take regular PC/XT expansion cards.\n\nRS232 serial ports were built-in, but the CMOS (low battery consumption) serial I-O chip available at design time, a CMOS version of the Intel 8251, was register incompatible with the 8250 serial IC standard for the IBM PC. As a result, software written for the PC serial ports would not run correctly. This required the use of software written using the relatively slower and less flexible BIOS interrupt call (014h), or software written exclusively for the DG-1.\n\nVideo memory came out of that available for the operating system; if 256 kB of RAM was installed, only 204 kbytes might be available to the operating system and user's programs.\n\nAlthough \"Creative Computing\" termed the price of US$2895 \"competitive,\" it was a very expensive system, and usually-needed additions such as more RAM and an external 5¼\" drive drove the price higher yet. The styling of the product, including a bag designed by Pierre Cardin, implied a more up-market buyer than many typical PC buyers of the time.\n\nThe Data General-One also had a built-in dumb terminal emulator, suggesting an attempt to attract as customers those in organisations with large, expensive minicomputers or mainframes that would access corporate data via terminals such as the ADM-3A or Data General's own Dasher terminals (the cost of the laptop would not have seemed excessive in such situations).\n\nThe screen was this computer's other great flaw. Although unusually large, the LCD display had very low contrast and narrow viewing angle. \"InfoWorld\" stated that \"the godawful screen made a better mirror than display\", and \"PC Magazine\" reported that \"The exchange 'Why don't you turn it on?' / 'It \"is\" on' is no joke. It happened in our offices.\"\n\nDespite the memorable advertisements (\"The first computer able to fit \"inside\" the IBM PC\"), the DG-1 was only a modest success. One problem was the use of 3½\" diskettes, which were slightly ahead of their time; popular software titles were not available in 3½-inch format, and this was a serious issue, because then-common diskette copy-protection schemes made it difficult for users to copy the software into that format. Additionally, the diskettes used a proprietary formatting scheme not compatible with products from other companies. Although \"Creative Computing\" termed the price of US$2895 \"competitive\", it was a very expensive system and optional additions, such as expanded RAM and an external 5¼-inch floppy drive, drove the price considerably higher. The 4.0 MHz CPU speed was fractionally slower than the then-current 4.77 MHz IBM PC. The Achilles' heel, however, was the LCD, which was not backlit, had poor contrast, and was frequently accused of serving better as a mirror than as a display screen. Usable outdoors or in bright offices only, a flashlight, it was joked, was often necessary to see the contents of the screen.\n\nAnother product killer was the incompatible serial port chip, an Intel 82C51, which was used to conserve power, instead of the 8250 used in the IBM PC. For a portable system, this was a critical flaw: PC programs that used the serial port wouldn't run on the DG-1 due to the non-standard register arrangement within the 82C51.\n\nAn updated version of the DG-1 appeared later with a much improved electroluminescent screen. However, the light-producing display could be washed out by bright sunlight.

He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the seventh round of the 2000 NFL Draft. He won Super Bowl XLV with them over the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football at Wisconsin. He now provides studio commentary for NFL coverage on Sky Sports in Britain.\n\nWhile attending Auburndale High School (Auburndale, Wisconsin), Tauscher won three varsity letters in football and baseball along with two varsity letters in basketball, and went to state for basketball in 1992-93. In football, he was a two-time All-Conference honoree, while earning Honorable Mention All-State and team MVP honors as a senior. In basketball, he won All-Conference honors. He was also a member of the National FFA Organization.\n\nTauscher made the University of Wisconsin–Madison team as a walk-on in 1995. After seeing little action his first two years, Tauscher earned a letter in 1998 and became a starter at right tackle the following year. He contributed significantly as a blocker to Ron Dayne's Heisman Trophy-winning season in 1999. He considered not returning for his 5th year.\n\nDuring the 2000 NFL Draft, Tauscher was selected by the Packers in the seventh round with the 224th choice overall. He became a starter early in his rookie season, when long-time starter Earl Dotson suffered a back injury at Buffalo.\n\nDuring the second game of the 2002 season, Tauscher suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament and a torn anterior cruciate ligament. As a result, he underwent surgery and missed the rest of the season. He made a successful comeback, however, and started every game since his return in 2003. However, his streak would come to an end during the 13th game of the 2008 season vs the Houston Texans. Tauscher suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and missed the remaining three games of the season.\n\nAfter the 2008 season was over, Tauscher became an unrestricted free agent. Tauscher worked out for the Kansas City Chiefs but the Packers eventually re-signed him four games into the 2009 season due to the Packers offensive line struggling to protect quarterback Aaron Rodgers. He became a free agent after the season again, but re-signed with the Packers on March 14, 2010.\n\nTauscher started at Right Tackle in the Packers' first four games of the 2010 season until he suffered a shoulder injury in a Week 4 matchup against the Detroit Lions. He was placed on injured reserve on November 12, 2010.\n\nTauscher was named Packers' 2008 Walter Payton Man of the Year and voted Packers' 2008 Ed Block Courage Award winner.\n\nHe was released by the team on July 29, 2011.\n\nTauscher was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame on July 21, 2018.\n\nTauscher provides commentary and analysis on both the Wisconsin Badgers football radio network and the Green Bay Packers radio network. He co-hosts Wilde & Tausch, a Packers centric sports talk show with Jason Wilde and appears twice weekly on WKTI radio in Milwaukee during the football season.\n\nTauscher founded the Trifecta Foundation which stands for Tauscher's Reading Initiative for Every Child to Achieve. He states that he found reading to be very challenging as a young child and credits a third grade teacher and a Pizza Hut \"Book It\" program with helping build his confidence.\n\nTauscher married Sarah Helgeson, in early 2009.

{"id": "1968295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968295", "title": "Creative Computing (magazine)", "text": "Creative Computing (magazine)\n\nCreative Computing was one of the earliest magazines covering the microcomputer revolution. Published from October 1974 until December 1985, the magazine covered the spectrum of hobbyist/home/personal computing in a more accessible format than the rather technically oriented \"BYTE\".\n\nThe company published several books, the most successful being \"BASIC Computer Games\", the first million-selling computer book. Their \"Best of Creative Computing\" collections were also popular. \"Creative Computing\" also published software on cassette and floppy disk for the popular computer systems of the time and had a small hardware business. \n\nZiff-Davis purchased \"Creative Computing\" in 1983 and closed the non-magazine endeavors.\n\nPrior to starting \"Creative Computing\", in the early 1970s David H. Ahl was working in the educational department of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) where he started publication of their \"Edu\" newsletter in the spring of 1971. He was surprised to find that the number of subscribers, which reached 20,000 after 18 months, was much larger than the 2,000 or 3,000 he predicted based on the number of DEC machines in educational settings. He found that many subscribers did not have a DEC machine but were using \"Edu\" as a source of general information on computers in educational settings. This began his earliest thoughts about a non-DEC magazine aimed at this market.\n\nOn 22 February 1973, Ahl was let go during a downsizing at DEC. But before he even received his last paycheck, he was re-hired by a different department to help develop new low-end versions of the DEC minicomputer line. During this period he collected many user submissions to \"Edu\" and convinced DEC to publish \"101 BASIC Computer Games\" in the summer of 1973. This was a hit, and eventually ran three publishing runs; July 1973, April 1974, and March 1975.\n\nBy 1974, the team had produced two new designs, a PDP-8 combined with a VT50 terminal, and a briefcase-sized version of the PDP-8 with a small floppy disk. When these were personally canceled by Ken Olsen with the statement that \"I can't see any reason that anyone would want a computer of his own\" Ahl quit DEC and took a position at AT&T.\n\nIt was at this point that Ahl decided to move ahead with the educational-focused magazine. Reasoning that the educational market would be of interest to public foundations and many companies, Ahl sent funding proposals to over a hundred companies and received nothing. Instead, he used his own funds to print 11,000 copies of a flier that he sent to Hewlett-Packard and other minicomputer vendors, which resulted in 850 subscriptions to a magazine that didn't even exist yet.\n\nInstead of printing 850 copies, Ahl split the subscription money in two, kept one half for future operations, and used the other half to print as many copies of the new magazine as he could. This allowed for the printing of 8,000 copies of the first edition, which were completed on 7 October 1974. The subscribers were sent their copies first, but the rest were sent for free to a wide variety of companies, libraries and schools. He followed the same pattern for the next three issues. The trick worked, and subscriptions began to pour in.\n\nBy August 1975 the magazine had 2,500 subscribers. In January, the Altair 8800 had been announced and Ahl began looking for new authors who could write for the exploding microcomputer market. By 1976 the content was roughly split between the education and microcomputing market. At that point, the magazine started actively looking for advertisers and the November/December 1976 issue was the first to be printed on coated paper rather than newsprint to provide better quality ads.\n\nBy 1978 the subscriptions hit 60,000, and revenue was approaching $1 million. In July 1978, Ahl quit his position at AT&T to work at \"Creative Computing\" full time. This caused friction with his wife. In August, they purchased ROM magazine and two smaller newsletters and combined their content into the magazine. In January 1979, the magazine went monthly from bimonthly.\n\nBy 1979 the magazine had outgrown the single-family home it was being run from, and Ahl looked for a larger duplex home that would allow him to live with his wife in one half and run the magazine from the other. It was at this time that Regis McKenna, the advertizing company handling Apple Computer was asked to pay an overdue advertising bill. The company provided a canceled check proving they had already done so. When they began tracking it down, the police were called and found that two people in the company had conspired to embezzle $100,000 by sending incoming cheques to a different bank. This was only discovered because one of the conspirators had forgotten to mark the bill as paid.\n\nWhen she was told the story, Ahl's wife had enough and kicked him out of the house pending a divorce. He moved into the only unused room in the other side of the building. During this time, Ted Nelson, known for the invention of hypertext, was briefly the editor. Nelson would arrive at 5 pm and work all night, waking Ahl in the bedroom when he started printing on a Qume daisy wheel printer. In October 1980 the company moved to a much larger office building.\n\nThrough this period, featured writers included Robert Swirsky, David Lubar, and John J. Anderson. The magazine regularly included BASIC source code for utility programs and games, which users could manually enter into their home computers. The April issues, starting in 1980, became famous for their parodies of the major computer magazines of the time.\n\nLarger publishers began taking note of the computer market. A watershed moment was in 1979 when McGraw-Hill purchased \"Byte\". By 1982, most of the quality magazines had been purchased and only a few large ones remained independent, including \"Compute!\", \"Interface Age\", \"Family Computing\" and \"Creative Computing\".\n\nRealizing they were being pushed out of the market due to the huge budgets and marketing power of these major players, in 1982 Ahl approached several potential buyers, including Atari, CBS and Ziff-Davis. In 1983 Ahl sold the company to Ziff-Davis, which at that time published 28 different magazines. Ahl remained the Editor-in-Chief. At their peak, the magazine reached about 500,000 subscriptions.\n\nThrough the early 1980s, and especially with the launch of the IBM PC, the market began to shift from a hobby-and-educational oriented one to more and more business applications. Ziff quickly shifted the focus of the magazine to be more software-oriented, and the programming articles disappeared shortly after the sale. This attempt to refocus on business computing was not successful, and when Bill Ziff had a cancer scare in 1985 he began concentrating his businesses, selling off many of the specialty magazines. Ziff ultimately ceased publication of \"Creative Computing\" in December 1985.\n\nThe company also began publication of several other magazines at different times, but none of these were very successful and tended to have very short production runs. Among these were \"Small Business Computing\", \"Sync Magazine\" for the ZX81, and \"Video and Arcade Games\".\n\nThe company also published several books. Among these were three volumes of \"The Best of Creative Computing Magazine\" (Creative Computing Press) in 1976, 1977, and 1980. The cover of volume 2 was illustrated by underground cartoonist Gilbert Shelton. \"101 BASIC Computer Games\" was ported to Microsoft BASIC and published in 1978 as \"BASIC Computer Games\". It became the first million-selling computer book. This was followed by \"More BASIC Computer Games\" in 1979.\n\nIt also published the first \"The Best of Byte\" collection, in spite of being friendly competitors with \"Byte\". The relationship ended with the McGraw-Hill purchase.\n\nA number of home computer games were published under the Sensational Software banner, also known as Creative Computing Software. Their best seller was a version of \"Space Invaders\" for the Apple II. Ziff-Davis closed the division as they felt it competed with their advertisers.\n\nTitles included:\n\nThe company also briefly sold hardware under the Peripherals Plus brand. The main product was a music card for the Apple II, although they also sold a plotter and a few other products. Ziff closed this division as well.\n\n\n"}

It covers a diversity of activities that can affect human health and the environment, and acts to address any pollution issues not covered by other federal laws. As such, the \"Act\" is a \"catch all\" piece of legislation that ensures potentially toxic substances are not inadvertently exempt from federal oversight as a result of unforeseen legislative loopholes.\n\nThe \"Act\" also recognizes the contribution of pollution prevention and the management and control of toxic substances and hazardous waste to reducing threats to Canada's ecosystems and biological diversity.\n\nIt acknowledges, for the first time, the need to virtually eliminate the most persistent toxic substances that remain in the environment for extended periods of time before breaking down and bioaccumulative toxic substances that accumulate within living organisms.\n\nHealth Canada works in partnership with Environment and Climate Change Canada to assess potentially toxic substances and to develop regulations to control toxic substances.\n\nSection 93 of the \"Act\" provides the authority to the federal government to make regulations to restrict and manage pollution in Canada.\n\nOriginally enacted in 1988, the \"Act\" provided a systematic approach to assess and manage chemical substances in the environment that were not addressed under existing programs. After being reviewed in the 1990s, it was replaced by the current legislation that provides new powers for health and environmental protection. It was introduced as Bill C-32 on , subsequently receiving Royal Assent on . The \"Act\" came into force on .\n\nAs a Canadian statute, the \"Act\" is unique for including a declaration of \"primary purpose\" in addition to a preamble.\n\nAll new substances must be evaluated for human health and environmental risks before they can be manufactured or imported into Canada. Responsibility for these evaluations is shared between Environment Canada and Health Canada and is administered by the New substances Program, which administers regulations relating to the notification of new substances into the environment.\n\nExisting substances include all 23,000 substances that were in use in Canada prior to the establishment of the New Substances Notification Program, and they are all listed on the \"Domestic Substances List\" (DSL). The \"Act\" required systematic screening of these substances, a process that was completed in September 2006, which led to the development of the Chemicals Management Plan.\n\nThe 23,000 existing substances on the DSL included 67 microbial strains and 2 complex microbial cultures. These substances were subject to a separate prioritization assessment and accordingly evaluated.\n\nHealth Canada and Environment Canada share responsibility for conducting risk assessments of new biotechnology products (including micro-organisms) that are not subject to a pre-manufacture toxicity assessment under other federal legislation. Under the \"Act\", both naturally occurring and genetically modified organisms are evaluated under the \"New Substances Notification Regulations (Organisms)\". \n\nRisk assessment decisions are summarized and posted publicly.\n\nEnforcement activities related to the \"Act\" can include:\n\nFines under the \"Environmental Enforcement Act\" (EEA) range from $5,000 to $6,000,000. The EEA applies to offences under CEPA 1999. The EEA also allows arrest without warrant, seize or detain anything items related to a CEPA 1999 offence or related evidence, detain or redirect ships suspected of an offence. Convictions or indictments under the EEA can also result in imprisonment up to three years. Prosecutions under CEPA 1999 are listed on Environment Canada's website.\n\n"}

He hired Indianapolis architect Henry Dupont to design the hotel and Carlton Beard as contractor. To ensure the stability of the hotel on the shifting sand and avoid the high cost of sinking so many pilings, Beard devised a floating concrete pad and pyramid footings. To this day there is no sign of evident settling of the hotel. The architecture is a blend of Mediterranean and Moorish styles modeled after different hotels and developments that Rowe and Beard saw in Palm Beach, Coral Gables and Boca Raton. Arched openings, red clay tile roofs, balconies, stucco over hollow tile and tower like upper stories were some of the elements that they borrowed. The original design called for a $450,000 six-story hotel with 110 rooms and baths. It was later expanded to 220 rooms and 220 baths and the costs soared to $1.25 million, 300% over budget. Rowe named it Don Ce-Sar after Don César de Bazan, the hero of William Vincent Wallace's opera \"Maritana\".\n\nRowe's \"Pink Lady\" opened on January 16, 1928, with an extravagant party attended by the elite of Tampa and St. Petersburg. The hotel quickly became a favorite romping ground for the rich and famous of the Jazz Age including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Clarence Darrow, Al Capone, Lou Gehrig, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Pink Palace continued to attract the rich and famous throughout the Great Depression, thanks in part to a deal made with New York Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert to house his team during spring training for three years.\n\nHowever, after the sudden death of Rowe without a will, \"The Don\" was left to his estranged wife and began to fall into disrepair until the United States entered into World War II and the hotel was bought out by the Army for $450,000. It was converted into a military hospital and reopened in December 1942. In February 1944 the Don Ce-Sar became a United States Army Air Corps convalescent center. In June 1945 the Don Ce-Sar was ordered closed and was vacant by September of that year. It was converted into a Veterans Administration Regional Office by the end of 1945.\n\nIn November 1967 the Veterans Administration began moving out of the Don Ce-Sar. By spring 1969, the once grand hotel was vacant. The General Services Administration planned to raze the graffiti-covered hotel, but this was met with fierce opposition from local residents. In March 1972 the Don Ce-Sar was sold to C.L. Pyatt and William Bowman Jr., a Holiday Inn franchise owner. The Don CeSar (now spelled without the hyphen) reopened on November 23, 1973. Multiple renovations from 1985 to 2001 have updated and added onto the hotel, including a spa, a signature restaurant, and a second outdoor swimming pool. After the addition of the full-service beach club and spa, the official name of the hotel was changed to The Don CeSar Beach Resort and Spa.\n\nThe Don CeSar was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and became a founding member of the National Trust Historic Hotels of America in 1989.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, in arid zones, once forest cover is destroyed, the land may become dry and inhospitable for the growth of new trees. Other factors include overgrazing by livestock, especially animals such as goats, cows, and over-harvesting of forest resources. Together these may lead to desertification and the loss of topsoil; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if erosion allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a duricrust or duripan that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth. In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.\n\nSeveral new studies suggest that forests attract rain and this may explain why drought is occurring more frequently in parts of the world such as western Africa. A new study by Carol Rasmussen,\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory gives the first observational evidence that the southern Amazon rain forest triggers its own rainy season using water vapor from plant leaves. The finding helps explain why deforestation in this region is linked with reduced rainfall. A study by Douglas Sheil and Daniel Murdiyarso hypothesises that forest cover plays a much greater role in determining rainfall than previously recognized. It explains how forested regions generate large-scale flows in atmospheric water vapor. Makarieva and Gorshkov have developed a hypothesis to explain how forests attract moist air and increase rainfall in area covered by trees.\n\nIn Adelaide, South Australia (a city of 1.3 million as of June 2016), Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days on sites including parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only Native trees were planted to ensure genetic integrity. He said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year.\n\nThere is extensive and ongoing Amazon deforestation.).\n\nThere is also ongoing afforestation effort in Brazil. In an afforestation hotspot outlined in Para, Brazil, 1 billion trees are intended to be planted to restore deforested lands by 2013.\n\nChina has deforested most of its historically wooded areas. China reached the point where timber yields declined far below historic levels, due to over-harvesting of trees beyond sustainable yield. Although it has set official goals for reforestation, these goals are set over an 80-year time horizon and have not been significantly met by 2008. China is trying to correct these problems by projects like the Green Wall of China, which aims to replant a great deal of forests and halt the expansion of the Gobi desert. The Green Wall of China Project has historical precedences dating back to before the Common Era. However, in pre-modern periods, government sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification.\n\nA law promulgated in 1981 requires that every school student over the age of 11 plants at least one tree per year. As a result, China has the highest afforestation rate of any country or region in the world, with 47,000 square kilometers of afforestation in 2008. However, the forest area per capita is still far lower than the international average.\n\nAccording to Carbon Brief, China planted the largest amount of new forest out of any country between 1990 and 2015, facilitated by the country's Grain for Green programme started in 1999, by investing more than $100bn in afforestation programmes and planting more than 35bn trees across 12 provinces. By 2015, the amount of planted forest in China covered 79m hectares.\n\nFrom 2011–2016, the city Dongying in Shandong province forested over 13,800 hectares of saline soil through the Shandong Ecological Afforestation Project, which was launched with support from the World Bank. In 2017, the Saihanba Afforestation Community won the UN Champions of the Earth Award in the Inspiration and Action category for \"transforming degraded land into a lush paradise\".\n\nEurope has deforested the majority of its historical forests. The European Union (EU) has paid farmers for afforestation since 1990, offering grants to turn farmland back into forest and payments for the management of forest. Between 1993 and 1997, EU afforestation policies made possible the re-forestation of over 5,000 square kilometres of land. A second program, running between 2000 and 2006, afforested more than 1,000 square kilometres of land (precise statistics not yet available). A third such program began in 2007. Europe's forests are growing by 8,000 square kilometres a year thanks to these programmes.\n\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization statistics, Spain had the third fastest afforestation rate in Europe in the 1990-2005 period, after Iceland and Ireland. In those years, a total of 44,360 square kilometers were afforested, and the total forest cover rose from 13,5 to 17,9 million hectares. In 1990, forests covered 26.6% of the Spanish territory. As of 2007, that figure had risen to 36.6%. Spain today has the fifth largest forest area in the European Union.\n\nIn January 2013 the UK government set a target of 12% woodland cover in England by 2060, up from the then 10%. In Wales the National Assembly for Wales has set a target of 19% woodland cover, up from 15%. Government-backed initiatives such as the Woodland Carbon Code are intended to support this objective by encouraging corporations and landowners to create new woodland to offset their carbon emissions. Charitable groups such as Trees for Life (Scotland) also contribute to afforestation and reforestation efforts in the UK.\n\nAlpine and Subalpine regions have undergone a lot of deforestation and then forestation in the last 300 years. Out of this has emerged much practical experience. One example is the clustered group, which is a method to bring in stable age mixed tree communities.\n\nSince the founding of the crown colony in the 19th century, afforestation has taken place to prevent soil erosion in the catchment areas of the reservoirs that were built. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, the countryside was deforested as the remaining population required fuel to survive. Most of the trees were cut down and extensive reafforestation was carried out after the war. Trees that were planted are mostly non-native species, such as: Pinus massoniana, Acacia confusa (Formosan acacia), Lophostemon confertus and the Paper Bark Tree.\n\nAccording to the NASA study, China and India have led in increasing the Earth's greenery over the past two decades. In 1950 around 40.48 million hectares was covered by forest. In 1980 it increased to 67.47 million hectares and in 2006 it was found to be 69 million hectares. 23% of India is covered by forest. In 2018, the total forest and tree cover in India increased to 24.39% or 8,02,088 km. The forests of India are grouped into 5 major categories and 16 types based on biophysical criteria. 38% of the forest is categorized as subtropical dry deciduous and 30% as tropical moist deciduous and other smaller groups. Only local species are planted in an area. Trees bearing fruits are preferred wherever possible due to their function as a food source.\n\nIn 2019, Indians Planted 220 Million trees in a Single day in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOn Thursday, 29 August 2019, Prime Minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi released ₹47, 436 crores (over 6.6 Bn USD) to various states for compulsory afforestation activities. The funds can be used for treatment of catchment areas, assisted natural generation, forest management, wildlife protection and management, relocation of villages from protected areas, managing human-wildlife conflicts, training and awareness generation, supply of wood saving devices and allied activities. Increasing the tree cover would help in creating additional carbon sink to meet the nation's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by the year 2030 - part of India's efforts to combat climate change.\nThe Maharashtra government planted almost 20,000,000 saplings in the entire state, and will pledge to plant another 30,000,000 next year. According to The Telegraph, the Indian government has attributed $6.2 billion for tree-planting in order to increase “forestation in line with agreements made at the Paris climate change summit in 2015.” The Indian government has also passed the CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) law, which will allow about 40 thousand crores rupees (almost $6 Billion) will go to Indian states for planting trees.\n\nIran is considered a low forest cover region of the world with present cover approximating seven percent of the land area. This is a value reduced by an estimated six million hectares of virgin forest, which includes oak, almond and pistachio. Due to soil substrates, it is difficult to achieve afforestation on a large scale compared to other temperate areas endowed with more fertile and less rocky and arid soil conditions. Consequently, most of the afforestation is conducted with non-native species, leading to habitat destruction for native flora and fauna, and resulting in an accelerated loss of biodiversity.\n\nWith over 240 million planted trees, Israel is one of only two countries that entered the 21st century with a net gain in the number of trees, due to massive afforestation efforts. Most Israeli forests are the product of a major afforestation campaign by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).\n\nCritics argue that many JNF lands inside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank. Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding. Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war.\n\nSince 2009, the JNF has provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah.\n\nAfforestation projects in Japan started after the rebuilding that followed World War II, when large areas of forest were clear-cut for timber and to create pastures to attract immigrant farmers. A new management plan for the forests of Japan was instated after many pastures were abandoned and there was a recognized decline of old growth and secondary forests.\n\nMany African countries that border the Sahara desert are cooperating on the Great Green Wall project. The $8-billion project intends to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.\n\nAlso in North Africa, the Sahara Forest Project coupled with the Seawater greenhouse has been proposed. Some projects have also been launched in countries as Senegal to revert desertification. As of 2010, African leaders are discussing the combining of national resources to increase effectiveness. In addition, other projects as the Keita Project in Niger have been launched in the past, and have been able to locally revert damage done by desertification. See Development aid#Effectiveness\n\nAs Turkey was deforested over the past few thousand years some authors refer to the restoration of these forests as \"afforestation\" and some \"reforestation\". In Turkish \"ağaçlandırma\" can mean either of these or \"forestation\". So for readability the process is all described in Reforestation#Turkey.\n\nThe United States is roughly one-third covered in forest and woodland. Nevertheless, areas in the US were subject to significant tree planting. In the 1800s people moving westward encountered the Great Plains – land with fertile soil, a growing population and a demand for timber but with few trees to supply it. So tree planting was encouraged along homesteads. Arbor Day was founded in 1872 by Julius Sterling Morton in Nebraska City, Nebraska. By the 1930s the Dust Bowl environmental disaster signified a reason for significant new tree cover. Public works programs under the New Deal saw the planting of 18,000 miles of windbreaks stretching from North Dakota to Texas to fight soil erosion (see Great Plains Shelterbelt).\n\nAt their summit in Copenhagen in 2009, organised by the UK based The Climate Group, leaders of subnational governments – states, regions and provinces – unanimously supported a recommendation by Premier Rann to plant one billion trees across their varied jurisdictions. The initiative was strongly supported by leaders present including Quebec Premier Jean Charest, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. At a subsequent meeting in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, The Climate Group announced that it had already received commitments by member governments to plant more than 500 million trees.\n\nThe use of afforestation as strategy of conservation of forest biomes is seen as a menace to the conservation of natural grassland and savanna biomes, as the ideal would be the reforestation of areas where forest occurs naturally.\n\n\n"}

Founded in March 1808 as the Pierian Sodality, the orchestra is considered by some to be the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States. This is disputed by others because of the organization's somewhat informal beginnings (the original charter states that the intent of the Pierian Sodality is to \"perform music for the enjoyment of others as well as serenade young women in the square\"), and at one point during its history, the Pierian Sodality was reduced to only one member, a flautist named Henry Gassett. As a result, some consider the New York Philharmonic to be the oldest American orchestra. The HRO assumed its current form as a modern symphony orchestra during the first half of the 20th century, and was, for a brief time, the nation's largest collegiate orchestra.\n\nThe orchestra currently contains over 100 members, and is the largest of the orchestras at Harvard University. In general, only students of Harvard College are eligible for membership, though this rule is not absolute and has occasionally been waived when necessary, allowing students from the other Harvard schools to participate. The orchestra plays four season concerts every year in Sanders Theater on Harvard's campus. It also sometimes gives children's concerts and regularly participates in the annual Arts First arts festival at Harvard. Its alumni board is still known as the Pierian Sodality of 1808.\n\nFrom 1964 to 2009, the orchestra was led by James Yannatos, a composer and member of the music faculty at Harvard. He retired after the 2008-2009 school year, and Federico Cortese assumed the post of Music Director as of July 1, 2009.\n\nHRO has toured various places throughout its history, including South Korea, Brazil, Washington, D.C., Mexico, Canada, Italy, Soviet Union, Asia, Europe, and most recently, Cuba. HRO has also performed in Carnegie Hall, and in 1978 placed third in the International Festival of Student Orchestras.\n\n"}
{"id": "1968340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968340", "title": "Sunpyre", "text": "Sunpyre\n\nSunpyre () is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is commonly associated with the X-Men, and is the sister of Sunfire.\n\nLeyu Yoshida and her brother Shiro were born to a mother who suffered radiation poisoning due to exposure to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan. As a result, she and her brother were born mutants, possessing identical powers. Her brother would go on to be the well-known Japanese superhero Sunfire.\n\nLeyu first appeared, during the storyline, when she joined the X-Men for a single mission, to help fight Magneto. Jean Grey had summoned her brother, but instead got Sunpyre, who she says Shiro had never even mentioned before, as Shiro had refused because he was unavailable at the time. Despite Jean not knowing Sunpyre at all, she easily accepts her offered assistance as the situation was so extreme.\n\nJean's makeshift team of X-Men consists of long-term allies Northstar and Dazzler. There were also civilians Omerta and Wraith.\n\nDazzler had problems of her own and with a Jean-assisted telepathic conference, Sunpyre learns of the childlike Age of Apocalypse villains. Thus, Sunprye is one of the few in current continuity to have any idea the Age of Apocalypse actually had happened.\n\nSunpyre fights valiantly against Magneto, but almost loses her life when the master of magnetism constructs a metallic cocoon around her. After the mission was completed successfully, Sunpyre chose to return to her home instead of stay in the United States with the \"arrogant\" X-Men.\n\nBanshee later requests her to join his X-Corps (again replacing Sunfire, who did not want to join). This time she was removed from the front lines and instead spent most of her time in the laboratory studying the mutant Abyss. No explanation was provided for the fifteen-year-old's sudden expertise in mutant genetics. When Mystique, who had infiltrated the group and brought together the other former villains, began her plan for taking over the X-Corps, Sunpyre was one of the casualties. Mystique stabs her to death. When Banshee finds her corpse, he is also stabbed but he survives his wounds. Mystique had wanted to release Abyss, but she got more than she bargained for when the mutant was unable to turn off his powers and sucked the shapeshifter into the dimensional void in his chest cavity.\n\nSunpyre was later apparently resurrected as a female East Asian mutant who looks exactly just like her (even complete with her signature flame aura) was most recently seen with other former X-Men and X-Men-related characters in Cyclops's Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.\n\nSunpyre had powers similar to those of her brother, Sunfire. She could convert solar and some other ambient energy into ionized plasma similar to the sun's, which she could use to fire blasts of heat and flame, surround herself with an aura of solar-powered fire, and fly close to by riding convection currents created by superheating the surrounding air with her aura of flames. This plasma, while surrounding her, also provided protection against energy and physical attacks. Also, she was resistant to most forms of radiation, and could see heat by attuning her eyes to the infrared wavelength of the light wave.\n\nAn extra-dimensional Sunpyre, who was a princess on her own homeworld in the Microverse, later appeared as part of Big Hero 6 in \"Alpha Flight\" vol. 3 #9. Teammate Honey Lemon pulled Sunpyre out of Lemon's Power Purse, resulting in Sunpyre worshipping Honey Lemon as a goddess and Sunpyre joining the team. Sunpyre and Ebon Samurai were both created to fill in the void left by Sunfire and Silver Samurai, who were being used elsewhere at the time. This version of Sunpyre is not on the current Big Hero 6 roster, as she has returned to reclaim her throne with the help of her teammate and current-retainer, the undead Ebon Samurai.\n\nScott Lobdell clarified the relationship of Honey Lemon and Sunpyre in the Marvel Teams Handbook 2005. This Sunpyre retained her powers during M-Day. However, this Sunpyre's powers were not mutant in nature, but rather powers inherent to her extra-dimensional Coronarian race.\n\n"}

It became one of PBS Kids' most popular series on the line-up since \"Barney & Friends\" and \"Sesame Street\". It follows a multi-ethnic group of kids (puppets) from different parts of the United States who hang out at \"the Puzzle Place\", which is a teen hangout themed around jigsaw puzzle pieces.

He attended the University of Chicago, earning his bachelor of philosophy in 1926 and continuing graduate work into 1928. From 1928 to 1930, he was a member of the staff of the Johns Hopkins University Institute of Law, returning to the University of Chicago as a research assistant and to write his thesis from 1930 to 1933. From 1933 to 1934, he was a member of the staff of the Brookings Institution. In the summer of 1934, he was a consultant in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury Department; in the summer of 1936 and spring-summer 1939, he was again a consultant at the Treasury. From the autumn of 1934 until the spring of 1939, he taught economics at the University of Toronto, remaining a member of its staff on leave for several years thereafter (in his testimony, Coe says \"4, 5, or 6 years\"). Beginning in 1939, he worked adviser to Paul McNutt, then head of the Federal Security Agency, and in 1940 as assistant to Leon Henderson in the Office of Price Administration (then known as the National Defense Council).\n\nLate in 1940, he returned to the Treasury Department as an assistant director of monetary research, where he stayed for about a year, during which he was special assistant to the United States Ambassador in England. In 1942, he became Executive Secretary of the Joint War Production Committee of the United States and Canada and an assistant to the Executive Director of the Board of Economic Warfare (later renamed the Foreign Economic Administration). In late 1944/early 1945, Coe was named Director of the Division of Monetary Research in the Treasury Department, serving as technical secretary at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944, he accepted a position as Secretary of the International Monetary Fund in 1946, his successor at Treasury being Harold Glasser.\n\nCoe resigned from the Fund in December 1952 after public calls were made by Congress for his ouster. The IMF announced his resignation on December 3, 1952.\n\nThe evidence against Coe stems from his being named by two defected spies and ex post examinations of his career.\n\nIn 1939, former Communist underground courier Whittaker Chambers named Coe to then-Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle as a communist sympathizer who was providing information to the Ware group.\n\nIn 1948, former NKVD courier Elizabeth Bentley, testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, mentioned Coe, whom she remembered as one of several important Treasury officials who passed on information to Silvermaster.\n\nCalled before the HUAC (chaired by Congressman Karl Mundt), Coe denied under oath having ever been a member of the Communist Party USA. Subsequently, he was questioned intensely in the IMF about his activities, but he was not sanctioned or removed from his duties. In late 1952, he was called before a Grand Jury in New York (presided over by Senator Herbert O'Conor) and then before the McCarran Committee on December 1, 1952, both of which were investigating alleged Communist affiliations of U.S. citizens working for the United Nations and other international organizations. On the latter occasion, he declined to answer the question of whether he was a member of the Communist Party on Fifth Amendment grounds, citing the example of Alger Hiss's conviction for perjury.\n\nHis final appearance before McCarthy's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) came on June 5 and 8, 1953, chaired by then Senator Karl Mundt.\n\nNominally, the investigation was into interference with negotiations to devalue the Austrian schilling in November 1949 as the Soviets had apparently been profiting from the black market. U.S. officials with the European Cooperation Administration (the Marshall Plan aid agency) reported that a command came via a tickertape telecon to break off negotiations at the last minute. The telecon, which was with an anonymous person at the State Department, cited Coe in his capacity as Secretary of the IMF as the source of the order. (In truth, the devaluation had been discussed by and was supported by the Executive Board of the IMF.)\n\nThe PSI ascertained that Coe could not have been the source of the communication as he was in the Middle East at the time, and quickly turned to investigating Coe's alleged Communist activities. Coe, who consulted constantly with his lawyer Milton S. Friedman, maintained his Fifth-Amendment plea, stating at one point that he did not want to see the blacklist extended to include those who had helped him in his search for work.\n\nThe subsequent report of the Senate Sub-Committee on Internal Security stated: \"Coe refused to answer, on the grounds that the answers might incriminate him, all questions as to whether he was a Communist, whether he was engaged in subversive activities, or whether he was presently a member of a Soviet espionage ring. He refused for the same reason to answer whether he was a member of an espionage ring while Technical Secretary of the Bretton Woods Conference, whether he ever had had access to confidential Government information or security information, whether he had been associated with the Institute of Pacific Relations, or with individuals named on a long list of people associated with that organization.\n\nRegarding his policy actions, it is often mentioned that Coe, together with Assistant Treasury Secretary Harry Dexter White and Treasury economist Solomon Adler, opposed President Franklin Roosevelt's gold loan program of $200 million to help the Nationalist Chinese Government stabilize its currency in 1943. However, White's documents indicate while he favored giving economic assistance, he had concerns that cash assistance might be misused or fall into enemy hands.\n\nArlington Hall cryptographers identified the Soviet agent designated \"Peak\" in the Venona project as \"possibly\" Coe, but there is no clear reason for the identification. (One secondary source suggests it was because there was no additional information on Peak.) The decrypt in question reports that five reels of Peak's documents concerning U.S.-British Lend-Lease negotiations were en route to Moscow.\n\nA recent investigation into the KGB archives claims that files show Coe to have been a Soviet agent. However, the authors do not quote or reproduce the documents in question and at least one scholar argues that their testimony should be suspended until the primary sources become available.\n\nCoe was Blacklisted, the US denied his passport (in late 1949) and prevented Coe from traveling to neighboring countries (June 1953) due to his ties to Soviet espionage. Coe sought work abroad, eventually finding a sponsor in the People's Republic of China, where he joined a circle of expatriates working with the government. In 1962, he was joined by Solomon Adler in the circle. Coe participated in Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, a plan for the rapid industrialization and modernization of China, which in fact resulted in millions of deaths. Coe sought works included articles justifying the Rectification campaign.\n\nCoe died in Beijing, China on June 2, 1980. The New China News Agency listed the cause of his death as a pulmonary embolism and indicated that government officials visited him often during his illness. His brother indicated that he had undergone surgery for cancer eight months earlier.\n\n"}

He moved to Georgia and later represented Elbert County, Georgia, in the Georgia Legislature. He was twice elected as a state senator from that district. After a full term as judge of the Coweta circuit, he settled in Decatur in 1822, being one of the first settlers in DeKalb County. He was again sent to the legislature.\n\nIn 1826 DeKalb County Academy was founded and the next year, Ezzard, as well as Judge Reuben Cone and nine others, were named as trustees in the incorporation. In 1827, at the age of 28, he was sent to the Georgia state senate from DeKalb County.\n\nHe served as Solicitor General of the Cherokee Circuit from December 8, 1832, to December 1835. Then he was brigadier general of the First Brigade, 11th Division, in the Georgia militia. He resigned in November 1840 and was Judge of the old Coweta Circuit from November 6, 1840, until November 1844. While in that office, he administered the estate of Hardy Ivy and was responsible for subdividing his estate comprising land lot 51.\n\nEzzard moved to Atlanta in 1850, where he was a law partner to Judge John Collier and operated a dry goods and drug store Smith & Ezzard. He co-founded the Atlanta Bank in 1852 with John Mims, Clark Howell, Sr., Jonathan Norcross, Richard Peters, William Butt, Lemuel Grant, Joseph Winship, N.L. Angier, Joseph Thompson and other investors.\n\nHe served three one-year terms as mayor in 1856, 1857 (this was the first time consecutive terms had been served by any mayor. His term included him visiting Charleston, where Atlanta was named the Gate City)) and finally in 1860.\n\nIn 1861, he was defeated for a fourth term by Whitaker by the count of 695 votes to 452. He was then a delegate to the Southern Congress, principally in the failed effort to secure the Confederate capitol at Atlanta. During the American Civil War, he represented Atlanta in the Georgia General Assembly house from 1863 to 1865, where he offered a bill to raise soldiers pay to $25 per month (which was passed). Coincidentally, one son, John F. Ezzard, died as a soldier at the age 33 in October 1864.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his law firm with William Hulsey, and Judge Ezzard defeated Republican William Markham 819 to 762 when he served as mayor for his fourth and last time in 1870. In 1878 he was elected as tax receiver for Fulton County.\n\nHe made his home on the future site of the Piedmont Hotel on Forsyth Street. In April 1871, Ezzard joined fellow pioneers to found the Atlanta Pioneer and Historic Society, of which he was voted president with Jonathan Norcross as vice president.\n\nHe was buried at Oakland Cemetery in the family lot, but the grave was not marked. He is remembered by Ezzard Street in the southern section of the Old Fourth Ward.\n\nAnother son, William Lane Ezzard, co-founded the Gate City Guard in 1855. He died in 1903.\n\nHis granddaughter Catherine (daughter of Ezzard's biracial daughter Sinai Calhoun Webb, born a slave in 1830), married Antoine Graves, a prominent black realtor and educator in Atlanta.\n\n"}

At this time a similar but open crown, the one of the queen, existed too. One of them was melted down in 1590 by the Catholic League during the siege of Paris. The remaining crown was used up to the reign of King Louis XVI, who was crowned in 1775 in the Cathedral in Reims. The crown of Jeanne d'Évreux was then used for the coronation of the queens.\n\nFrench kings had also their personal crowns, worn after the coronation, during the banquet held at the Palace of Tau, like the crown of Saint Louis called the \"Sainte Couronne de France\", Henry IV or Louis XIV which were later donated to the treasury of the Abbey of Saint Denis near Paris, the traditional burial place of the Capetian dynasty.\n\nOnly one of the 11 personal crowns of the Ancient Regime remains, the \"Crown of Louis XV\", manufactured for the coronation of Louis XV in 1722, and 5 crowns from the 19th century. The coronation crown, the Crown of Charlemagne, was destroyed in the French Revolution, like some of the regalia. From the Ancien Régime regalia, except for Louis XV's crown, the Throne of Dagobert, the medieval coronation sword of the French kings \"Joyeuse\", the spurs, the brooch said of Saint Louis, the ivory sceptre, called Hand of Justice, the sceptre of Charles V, as well as the antique cup of the Ptolemies with its paten or the coronation chalice kept in Reims survived.\n\nThe Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire or \"Reichskrone\", probably made for the coronation of Otto the Great in 962 at the workshops of the imperial monastery of Reichenau, was also later identified as the Crown of Charlemagne and as such appeared on the escutcheon of the Arch-Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire and at the top of the coat of arms of the Habsburg emperors at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.\n\nWhen Napoleon proclaimed himself Emperor of France, he also called his own imperial crown the \"Crown of Charlemagne\".\n"}

Formerly the \"GAFE\" (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales | Special-Forces Airmobile Group), the SF Corps has six battalions; one is the \"Fuerza especial de reaccion\", a quick-response unit, and one is assigned to the Paratroopers Rifle Brigade; the motto of the SF Corps is \"Todo por México\" (Everything for Mexico). \n\nWithin the SF Corps, there are regular, intermediate, and veteran -service troops. The regular-service soldiers usually operate as light infantry. The intermediate-service soldiers (lieutenants and captains) usually are instructors. The veteran-service soldiers of the Fuerzas Especiales del Alto Mando (FEs High Command) handle Black-Ops missions. Also known as the COIFE, the Special Forces Corps of the Mexican Army is equivalent to the U.S. Army Special Forces.\n\nGAFE was created in 1986 as the \"Fuerza de Intervención Rápida\" (\"Rapid Intervention Force\") to provide security for the FIFA World Cup soccer games in Mexico City. France's GIGN trained the group in special weapons and counter-terrorism tactics. On June 1, 1990 the group adopted its most known name, GAFE, becoming a Corps (with division-sized formation) in 2013 as part of the expansion of the Army. It again changed its name from GAFE to Special Forces Corps in 2004.\n\nEight years later (in 1994) the GAFEs saw action fighting EZLN guerrillas in Chiapas. There is scant public information about the operations in which they participated during that conflict. During the 1990s, the GAFE reportedly received training in commando and urban warfare from Israeli special forces and American Special Forces units, which included training in rapid deployment, marksmanship, ambushes, counter-surveillance and the \"art of intimidation\". It is also known that at some point several members were trained in the infamous US Army School of the Americas, in enhanced interrogation techniques and psychological warfare (Psy-Ops).\n\nNowadays the army special forces continue fighting the war against drug cartels in Mexico. They have successfully captured many big drug leaders such as Benjamin Arellano Felix of the Tijuana Cartel, Carlos Rosales Mendoza of La Familia Cartel and Osiel Cardenas Guillen of the Gulf Cartel.\n\nIn 1994 the EZLN guerrilla seized several towns across the southern state of Chiapas. The Mexican government sent in \"GAFEs\" to put down the insurgents. Within hours, 30 rebels were killed and others were captured. Later their bodies were disposed on a riverbank – with their ears and noses sliced off.\n\nIn 1999, about 34 GAFE defectors were recruited to join the Gulf Cartel, serving as the cartel's armed wing - which became known as Los Zetas. This group also recruited national and foreign military personnel (like U.S. Army soldiers and Guatemalan Kaibiles), corrupt police officers and street gang members, and used their knowledge of torture and psychological warfare to terrorize their rivals and innocent civilians alike. By 2011 only 10 of the original 34 zetas remained fugitives. Most of them have been killed or captured by Mexican Army, Federal Police and the Special Forces Corps.\n\nIt is alleged that on October 2, 2013 during a demonstration by so-called \"anarchist youth groups\" to protest against the Mexican President and to commemorate the 1968 tlatelolco student massacre, undercover GAFEs worked as agent provocateurs to disrupt the march and cause the riot police to crush it.\n\nSince its creation they have received a wide variety of training from different special forces groups from around the world (including the French GIGN, Israeli Sayeret and American Green Berets). The Army unified all the knowledge by creating in 1998 the \"Escuela Militar de Fuerzas Especiales\" (En. Special Forces Military School). This became the \"\"Centro de Adiestramiento de Fuerzas Especiales\"\" (Special Forces Training Center), located in the foothills of the Iztaccíhuatl volcano, on 1 May 2002.

At that time, she encountered Wolverine in a private moment, which developed into a mutual attraction. Afterward, Mariko would frequently visit the United States to see Wolverine.\n\nSome time later, however, Mariko was married by Shingen to Yakuza gang leader Noburu-Hideki to solidify her father's connections to the Japanese underworld, and was subjected to brutal domestic abuse by her husband. She was later used by him to maneuver Wolverine into participating in an assassination of a rival by having the superhero inadvertently provide a distraction while protecting his true love/girlfriend from the rival's own assassins. This also had the intended effect of deepening Mariko's disgust for Logan upon witnessing Logan going berserk in battle. However, Mariko soon realized that her father was evil and was shaming her family with sinister schemes. To stop Shingen, Mariko planned to kill her father and then commit seppuku in recompense, but Logan, learning the truth about this manipulation and inspired by a personal epiphany about humanity, attacked and slew her father in a fair battle of honor before she could act. In doing so, Logan was convinced that Mariko would be honorbound to kill him for that and was prepared to die at her hands rather than harm her in self-defense. However, Mariko explained her opinion of her father and presented the family katana to Logan as a token of her approval as an honorable warrior who is properly entitled to it.\n\nUpon her father's death, she became head (Oyabun) of the Yakuza crime family Clan Yashida.\n\nMariko happily became Logan's fiancée, but their wedding was halted by the supervillain Mastermind who used a mind control device to change Mariko's mind. When the control was lifted, Wolverine and Mariko resumed their romantic relationship after a period of separation, but have not reconsidered marriage. Mariko also refused any closer engagement with Logan until she had dealt with her father's criminal legacy, which she felt honor-bound to rectify.\n\nThe X-Men returned from the first Secret Wars and, accidentally ending up in Japan, fighting a dragon their companion Lockheed had brought along. During the chaos, the young girl Amiko Kobayashi loses her mother when a collapsing building crushes her. Dying, the woman begs Wolverine to take care of her daughter. Since Wolverine could not take care of the girl himself, Wolverine chose to place Amiko in Mariko's care, whom the girl soon adopted as a surrogate mother. Amiko and Mariko were at one point targeted by Ogun (one of Wolverine's old enemies) but the attack was averted by Wolverine and Kitty Pryde.\n\nMariko was poisoned with tetrodotoxin from a blowfish by the assassin Reiko in the employ of her rival Matsu'o Tsurayaba. She asked Wolverine to kill her to avoid a painful death and preserve her honor. Wolverine killed her and vowed to avenge Mariko by yearly severing parts of Matsu'o's body on the anniversary of her death.\n\nPhaedra, an agent of the Hand, resurrected Shingen and stole a piece of Wolverine's soul to torture. Wolverine made a deal with Azrael (the Angel of Death) to kill Phaedra to stop resurrecting the dead if Azrael would heal Wolverine's soul. Phaedra attempted to convince Wolverine to spare her by offering to resurrect Mariko, but Wolverine refused. Wolverine stated that he would pay any price to bring Mariko back, but Logan deeply loved Mariko because she was a better person than himself in every way, and he knew that Mariko would never accept life if it meant that someone as evil as Phaedra was allowed to live as well.\n\nMany years later, Wolverine was captured by the Devil and taken to Hell. In order to have Wolverine comply with his demands, the lord of Hell had Mariko's soul (who had been condemned to Hell for her leadership of the Yashida clan's criminal activities) brought to torture Wolverine into submission; Wolverine, however, was eventually rescued by Puck and Thomas Logan. When Logan finally prepared to flee Hell, Logan intended to take Mariko alongside but (with nothing to return to in this life) she asked to be left behind and return to Earth and reclaim his own life, a request Logan reluctantly acquiesced to.\n\nOld Man Logan faced off against the Hand during their Regenix operation, facing their latest member called the Scarlet Samurai. Logan later discovered that Scarlet Samurai is Mariko resurrected by the Hand to serve as their weapon. With help from Logan, nanites were used to free Mariko from the Hand's control while Gorgon got away. When Logan prepared to return to his own time, he asked Mariko to keep an eye on the young girl would have been in his wife in his own timeline, feeling that asking the other X-Men to keep an eye on her would have risked bringing her too close to his own life whereas Mariko understood the consequences of loving Logan and would be able to keep the girl safe while keeping her distant.\n\nIn the \"Age of Apocalypse\" timeline, Mariko Yashida was a member of the Human High Council, a group of humans that opposed Apocalypse's tyrannical rule. While not engaged to Logan, Mariko was his former lover and she birthed a daughter, Kirika, an amalgam of X-23 and Amiko Kobayashi. Mariko participates in an attempt to bomb forces of Apocalypse based in North America, though she knows this would mean extensive civilian deaths.\n\nIn an alternate universe (Earth-2109), Mariko Yashida was Sunfire and a member of the Exiles from \"Exiles\" #2 (September, 2001) until her death in \"Exiles\" #37 (January, 2004) of their ongoing series. In the 2109 alternate universe, she had the same powers as her 616 Marvel Universe counterpart Sunfire and Sunpyre. This version was created by Judd Winick and Mike McKone. A Japanese citizen and a member of the X-Men in her reality, she was one of Marvel's few openly homosexual characters. She has a relationship with one reality's version of Spider-Woman (Mary Jane Watson).\n\nSunfire's open homosexuality has attracted some interest after coming out in \"Exiles\" #11. Her death has also garnered some attention. Perry Moore includes her as an example of the poor treatment of gay superheroes, paralleling the earlier Women in Refrigerators.\n\nJudd Winick has been accused of pursuing some broader social agenda, making Sunfire gay being one of his ideas used to support this notion, as he explains in an interview with Comic Book Resources:\n\nIn the \"What If\" story \"If Wolverine Had Married Mariko\", their marriage is not hindered by Mastermind, and Wolverine becomes head of the Shingen clan. However, they soon have to contend with the Yakuza, all united by the Kingpin. Although they appear to prevail with the aid of the Silver Samurai and Sunfire, Mariko is eventually assassinated by the Silver Samurai himself, who had turned traitor, leaving Wolverine to return to the X-Men.\n\nMariko Yashida appears in Wolverine Noir as a businesswoman looking to expand her father's interests into New York City.\n\nMariko Yashida appears in \"Wolverine MAX\" as a member of the Yashida clan during the early 1900s. She met and fell in love with Logan, but their relationship ended after he killed her father. In the present, Logan is shown in a relationship with a woman named Yami Yashida, until she is killed in a plane crash. She is also much older in this continuity having been born in the 1860s but died sometime in the 1910s.\n\n\nMariko Yashida appears as a major character in the 2013 film \"The Wolverine\", in which she is portrayed by Tao Okamoto. In this version, she's Ichirō Yashida's granddaughter, Shingen Yashida's daughter, Yukio's foster sister and Wolverine's love interest. At her grandfather's funeral, she gets kidnapped by the Yakuza crime syndicate but saved by Logan. As they hide in Yashida's house, they start to fall for each other. Mariko is kidnapped and taken to Yashida Corporation's headquarters where it's revealed that her father was the one who ordered the Yakuza to kidnap and ultimately assassinate her because Ichirō had left the family empire to her instead of Shingen. She is saved by Kenuichio Harada with the Black Ninja clan and taken to a research center based where Ichirō was born. When it's revealed that Ichirō's alive and used Mariko as bait to capture and extract Wolverine's immortality using a robotic adamantium armor, she manages to free Wolverine by directing the machine Wolverine is in into the sword strike, breaking her grandfather's focus and freeing Wolverine. Mariko also hits Ichirō with Wolverine's discarded claws, allowing Wolverine to finish her grandfather off. Later Mariko is Yashida Corporation's new CEO and says goodbye to Logan, hoping to see Logan again.\n\n"}

It consists of Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) Chapter 40B, Sections 20 through 23, along with associated regulations issued and administered by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development. Chapter 40B was enacted in 1969 to address the shortage of affordable housing statewide by reducing barriers created by local municipal building permit approval processes, local zoning, and other restrictions. Its goal is to encourage the production of affordable housing in all communities throughout the Commonwealth.\n\nFor the purposes of this statute, affordable housing is defined as a unit which could be purchased or rented by a household making up to 80% of the median income of the area. Such housing must be subject to affordable housing restrictions to preserve affordability in the long term.\n\nUnder Chapter 40B, in any municipality where less than 10% of its housing qualifies as affordable under the law, a developer can build more densely than the municipal zoning bylaws would permit, allowing more units per acre of land when building a new development, if at least 25% (or 20% in certain cases) of the new units have long-term affordability restrictions.\n\nChapter 40B continues to be controversial and it has not overcome the multiple barriers that exist to building affordable housing in the state. A study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition rated Massachusetts as being the least affordable state in which to rent an apartment in 2003. \nDespite the law, fewer new affordable housing units are built in Massachusetts compared to the state's needs. The state government as a policy works toward increasing the supply of inexpensive housing. The shortage contributes to sprawl as workers move further away from jobs in order obtain affordably priced houses. The high price of housing is one reason that young adults move away from Massachusetts.\n\nMunicipalities have occasionally attempted to gain \"affordable\" classification for existing inexpensive housing units which are not deed restricted to maintain the long-term future affordable status of the units. Some municipalities have requested that mobile homes be allowed. , state legislators are currently considering making this change.\n\nThe goal of the Affordable Housing Law (Chapter 40B) is to make at least 10% of every Massachusetts's community's housing stock affordable for moderate income households. As of June 30, 2011, 39 communities had met that goal. Details are available on the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) Subsidized Housing Inventory. In addition, 101 communities have developed Affordable Housing Production Plans that have been approved by DHCD. Six of those communities have been certified as meeting the benchmarks in their plans, which entitles them to \"safe-harbor\" protections from Chapter 40B proposals under 760 CMR 56.03()(b) and 56.03(4)(f).\n\nOver the last decade, the Affordable Housing Law has been directly responsible for approximately 80% of the affordable housing built in Massachusetts outside the major cities. More than 58,000 homes have been created for working families, seniors, and people with disabilities all across the state because of this law. Nearly half of all of the units were created by non-profits, like Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General, from 2005 to 2012, issued several reports criticizing lax enforcement of developers' profit limitations for 40B developments, and described subterfuges used by developers to earn more profit on affordable housing than the statute and regulations permit, and that the municipalities and the state have inadequate supervision, auditing, and enforcement of the municipal agreements with developers and developers' reporting of sales and profits under the agreements and law. \nIn addition, until he left office in 2012, Massachusetts Inspector General Gregory Sullivan frequently criticized Chapter 40B. As a result of recommendations from the Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Housing and Community Development has \"taken constructive actions to address the identified weaknesses that will strengthen the overall control process exercised by both Chapter 40B rental development owners and project administrators to ensure that only income-qualified households occupy affordable apartments developed under Chapter 40B.\" \n\nIn 2008 the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development issued a comprehensive revision of regulations and guidelines for Chapter 40B. In the same year, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court issued seven decisions on substantive and procedural issues in regard to Chapter 40B law, nearly the number of decisions rendered during the previous decade.\n\nHistorically and at present, there has been opposition to Chapter 40B, with some claiming that it encourages building unaffordable homes at high densities with few affordable units. The law is criticized heavily that it gives real-estate developers tremendous abilities to abuse the law and overthrow any municipal rights by building minimum amounts of low-income housing while turning large profits on many high end properties.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Massachusetts voters rejected an initiative petition (Question 2) that would have repealed Chapter 40B. The vote was 1,254,759 (58%) against repeal to 900,405 (42%) in favor of repeal. The Campaign to Protect the Affordable Housing Law, a state ballot committee, had been formed to oppose the elimination of the law. The campaign was a coalition of more than 950 individuals and organizations, including civic, business, religious, and academic leaders as well as senior, environmental, housing, and civil rights groups. The campaign was supported by all three gubernatorial candidates, Deval Patrick, Tim Cahill, and Charlie Baker. The group contended that repealing the affordable housing law would immediately halt the creation of housing that is affordable to seniors and working families in many communities across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1968464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968464", "title": "Waltham Cross", "text": "Waltham Cross\n\nWaltham Cross is a suburban former village and now a town in the south of the Borough of Broxbourne in Hertfordshire 12 miles (20 km) north by north-east of Charing Cross in central London. It is in the metropolitan area of London, the Greater London Urban Area. Three of the twelve tall ornate stone monuments named Eleanor crosses (carved and put up within about three years of the death of Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I) are intact, one here, one at Geddington and one at Hardingstone. It was the only one designed by a foreigner, a certain Nicholas who had more than one toponymic surname.\n\nThe town has a modest commercial centre, similar to many small towns of its type, and is immediately north of the M25 motorway and the London Borough of Enfield. Waltham Cross takes up a south-eastern corner of its county. The Waltham Cross post town stretches to the neighbouring town of Cheshunt and a small part of Enfield.\n\nThe town falls within Hertfordshire's Borough of Broxbourne, the metropolitan area of London, and the Greater London Urban Area, with Waltham Abbey to the east, Cheshunt to the north, and Enfield to the south. The M25 motorway runs immediately south of the town, bordering the area of Freezywater. The Waltham Cross post town includes the neighbouring town of Cheshunt, some northern sections of Enfield, including the Holmesdale Estate. Waltham Cross occupies a south-eastern far corner of Hertfordshire so bordering Essex, and its former parent Urban District was dissolved into its present local government unit, the Borough of Broxbourne in 1974.\n\nWaltham Cross was, for centuries from the building of its cross in the 1290s, a smaller locality in the ancient parish of Cheshunt in the Hertford hundred of Hertfordshire. The southern part of Cheshunt became increasingly to be considered Waltham Cross, which was formed into a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1855, with its church of Holy Trinity (since renamed Christ Church) built in 1832 and designed by the architect Edward Blore. The road, here long called the High Street, had 'Spital Houses' (Hospitalry Houses) near the county boundary, originally built in 1625 but rebuilt in 1908. In the early 20th century, all along the 2¼ miles of the road which Cheshunt and Waltham Cross covered, there were numerous inns and taverns, one or two of which, such as the Four Swans Inn, plied for trade until at least that date from the 17th century, but most of them dated from the 18th century and later.\n\nWaltham Cross formed part of Cheshunt Urban District from 1894 to 1974. In April 1974 the town, together with Cheshunt and the Hoddesdon urban district councils, merged to form the Borough of Broxbourne. The town takes its name from the Eleanor Cross which stands in its centre.\n\nAt the centre of the town is one of the three surviving medieval Eleanor crosses, memorials completed before the end of 1294 commemorating the over-night resting places of the coffin of Eleanor of Castile, wife of King Edward I, on its processional journey from Lincoln to Westminster Abbey in 1290. It was the only one designed by a foreigner, in name at least, Nicholas Dymenge de Reyns or de Legeri. Records, some patched together and non-contemporary, state her body, deceased on 28 November rested at St Albans on the night of 12 December and was carried to \"Waltham\" on the following day, where it rested for the night at Waltham Abbey and arrived in London on 14 December. A recreation of a fourth such cross, the most southerly, destroyed in the English Civil War is at Charing Cross station less than a mile from the abbey in London.\n\nIn the early 18th century the monument was surveyed by the Society of Antiquaries of London who, advocating its conservation, printed and illustrated the results in the pages of \"Vetusta Monumenta\" in 1721. However, restoration did not take place until 1832, when extensive rebuilding was carried out under William Barnard Clarke. A further major restoration was carried out in 1885–92, and yet another in 1950–53.\n\nThe cross is hexagonal in plan, in three stages. The main stage has three statues of the Queen, each standing in a niche under a canopy, while the other three faces have a niche bisected by a buttress. The original sculptures were by Alexander of Abingdon. These have been replaced in the course of restoration, but one of the originals can be seen on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nThe High Street is spanned by a gantry sign supporting four sculpted swans. It was originally the sign of the now-demolished Four Swans (or \"Swannes\") public house. The present sign is a replica erected in 2007. The original signs are now kept at Lowewood Museum, Hoddesdon.\n\nThe area is served by two railway stations, on different lines in London fare zone 7. Waltham Cross station has services to London Liverpool Street and Stratford via Tottenham Hale with links to the Victoria line. To the north services run to Hertford East or Bishops Stortford.\n\nTheobalds Grove station to the north of the town centre also provides services to London Liverpool street via Seven Sisters which also provides links to the Victoria line. The station and its services are run by London Overground.\n\nThere is a bus station in the town centre where many London Buses routes terminate and link with services further out of London.\n\nVictorian novelist Anthony Trollope lived at Waltham House, Waltham Cross for 12 years between 1859 and 1871, where he wrote twenty-six novels and entertained his illustrious London friends. His home was demolished in 1936 and on the general site now stands a 1930s parade of shops and the \"Moon and Cross\", a J D Wetherspoon public house, decorated with a literary theme.\n\nThe town centre has a pedestrianised High Street fronted by a mixture of chain stores, independent shops and banks; a covered shopping mall and Fishpools Department Store which specialises in upholstered and fancy furniture and has been in the town since 1899. A general market takes up parts of the street on Wednesdays and Fridays, morphed into occasional entirely French and entirely farmers' markets, season-dependent.\n\nPark Plaza west of the town adjacent to Junction 25 of the M25 hosts one of the world's largest printworks. This produces publications for News International including \"The Sun\", \"The Times\" and formerly the \"News of the World.\" Employing 200 people on a site to produce 86,000 newspapers per hour on each of its twelve printing presses (a total capacity of over 1,000,000 newspapers per hour), the plant cost £187 million (part of £650m spending including plants in Knowsley, near Liverpool, and Motherwell, near Glasgow) and replaced the News International press in Wapping.\n\nThe Showground site adjoining Waltham Town Lock on the River Lee was chosen as the site for the Lee Valley White Water Centre for the 2012 Olympics. It was the only new Olympic venue to be open ahead of the Games, and offers the public the chance to follow in the footsteps of the Olympic competitors by taking to the rapids themselves. \nA Gaelic Football club is a rare venue for the sport in the county, St Joseph's (Waltham Cross), and reflects a long history of the Anglo-Irish across many socio-economic sectors in the local area, including as to engineering and construction, the surrounding area having many reservoirs, railways and once vast building yards.\n"}
{"id": "1968469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968469", "title": "La création du monde", "text": "La création du monde\n\nLa Création du monde, Op. 81a, is a 15-minute-long ballet composed by Darius Milhaud in 1922–23 to a libretto by Blaise Cendrars, which outlines the creation of the world based on African folk mythology. The premiere took place on 25 October 1923 at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris.\n\nOn a trip to the United States in 1922, Darius Milhaud heard \"authentic\" jazz on the streets of Harlem, which left a great impact on his musical outlook. Using jazz elements, the following year he finished composing \"La Création du monde\", which was cast as a ballet in six continuous parts. The work was commissioned by the Ballets suédois, a ballet company which was contemporary to Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The company was very influential in the early 1920s, staging five seasons in Paris and touring continually.\n\nThe ballet reflects both the ideal of the aesthetic of Les six to combine popular forms of art and a centuries-old French penchant for exotica. Milhaud was very susceptible to all kinds of influences, but it was a different type of exotica that drew him. He was in the Paris of \"Le jazz hot\", singer Josephine Baker, Pablo Picasso's paintings, and the sculptures inspired by African masks. During the early '20s, African (and Afro-American) fashion was sweeping Paris, and this ballet may have been Ballets suédois' attempt to follow the trend.\n\nWhen Milhaud first heard an American jazz band in London (1920), he was reportedly so captivated that he took off to New York City to spend time in clubs and bars, visit Harlem and mingle with jazz musicians. After returning to France, Milhaud began to write in what he called a jazz idiom. He chose to color his music with bluesy turns of harmony and melody, swinging climaxes, and stomping rhythms. Jazz influences appear in many of his compositions, but this ballet was the first opportunity to express his new passion; even the instrumental grouping draws on his memories of New York City. \"In some of the shows,\" Milhaud noted, \"the singers were accompanied by flute, clarinet, trumpets, trombone, a complicated percussion section played by just one man, piano and string quartet.\"\n\nAt the time, \"La Création du monde\" was more a succès de scandale than a true success. The ballet costumes designed by Fernand Léger (who also created the stage sets) worked well visually, but were difficult to dance in; the costumes were heavy and too inflexible to allow the dancers to move freely.\n\nThe costumes and sets from the original performance of \"La Création du monde\" still survive in museums and galleries, while the music has taken its place in the concert repertoire. The choreography is revived occasionally out of curiosity.\n\nThe score is written for a small orchestra of eighteen instrumentalists: 7 woodwinds (2 flutes, 1 also piccolo; oboe; 2 clarinets; bassoon; alto saxophone), 4 brass (horn, 2 trumpets, trombone), piano, 2 percussion (1 multi-percussionist, 1 timpani/timbales), and strings (2 violins, violoncello, double bass). The alto saxophone part appears in the score where a viola part would generally be. Milhaud also made a version for piano and string quartet (Op. 81b).\n\nThe ballet is in six parts, played continuously in one movement as follows:\n\n\"Ouverture\"\n\nThe work begins with a solo for the saxophone played over a steady pulse. Other instruments are added to reach a climax, and the saxophone resumes. The trumpets come to the fore, the flutes comment on the saxophone tune. There is a general rumbling in the background while the saxophone and bassoon play together until the saxophone plays the end of the tune.\n\n\"Le Chaos avant la création\"\n\nThe piano and percussion thump out a rhythm and the double bass begins the subject of a jazz fugue. In turn, the trombone, saxophone and trumpet contribute to the fugal texture. Other instruments enter playing the subject as the music gets more and more complex. The fugue ends and slow, somewhat ominous music leads to the next section.\n\n\"La Naissance de la flore et de la faune\"\n\nThere is a return to the opening melody, played by flute against the tune from the second section played by cello gradually leading to a third tune, a blues, played by the oboe.\n\n\"La Naissance de l'homme et de la femme\"\n\nThis part sees the two violins pitted against the bassoon in a cakewalk.\n\n\"Le Désir\"\n\nPart five includes a solo for clarinet with a rhythmic accompaniment of piano, strings, and percussion and then sees the return of the tune from the first section which eventually gives way to the rhythmic accompaniment which increases in passion.\n\n\"Le printemps ou l'apaisement\"\n\nThe final section includes motives from the overture, and the first and second parts. The work closes with a gentle Dmaj9 chord from saxophone and strings.\n\n\n"}

Sherman's famous \"war is cruelty\" (often misquoted as \"war is hell\") letter.\n\nCalhoun was born in South Carolina; his father was a cousin of Democrat John C. Calhoun. After the death of his parents when he was 18, he moved to Decatur, Georgia to live with his older brother Ezkiel N. Calhoun who was a lawyer. He began studying law in 1831 and passed the bar February 22, 1832. Politically, Calhoun was a Whig in a largely Democratic district but was still elected to the Georgia General Assembly in 1837 from DeKalb County, and to the State Senate in 1851.\n\nIn 1852, Calhoun moved to Atlanta, where ten years later he served four one-year terms as its mayor.\n\nIn 1863, he commissioned a volunteer militia to defend his city. When Union troops under the command of William T. Sherman drew near during the Atlanta campaign, much of the population of Atlanta, including Calhoun's wife and children, fled the city. This reduced the population of Atlanta from around 22,000 to less than 3,000 when the Confederate Army of Tennessee retreated from the city on September 1, 1864.\n\nCalhoun surrendered the city to Union forces under Sherman on September 2, 1864, writing, \"Sir: The fortune of war has placed Atlanta in your hands. As mayor of the city I ask protection of non-combatants and private property.\" A marker now stands at the corner of Peachtree Street and Alabama Street indicating where the surrender took place. Sherman replied by ordering the evacuation of the remaining civilian population of Atlanta on September 7, 1864. Calhoun and the city council protested this order, claiming that most of those who had not fled could not leave on account of their age, sickness, pregnancy, or destitution. In response, Sherman wrote back, accusing the Confederates of hypocrisy for invading Union territory and inflicting pains on American citizens, but only complaining when the reverse was done to them:\n\nUnion soldiers under Sherman occupied the city for two months and burned much of it on November 15, 1864, in preparation for the March to the Sea.\n\nCalhoun is buried in Oakland Cemetery. His son, William Lowndes Calhoun, served as Atlanta's mayor in the 1870s.\n\n"}

He is best remembered for his work on \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", and for once mispronouncing President Herbert Hoover's name on the air, a slip that was exaggerated on a later comedy record album.\n\nHarry von Zell was born July 11, 1906, in Indianapolis, Indiana, where his father was a sports reporter. The family moved to Sioux City, Iowa, where von Zell graduated from high school. Later, the family moved to California, where he studied music and drama at the University of California, Los Angeles, and worked at a variety of jobs. After friends tricked him into singing on a radio program, he began receiving offers from radio stations, and his career in that medium began.\n\nVon Zell broke into show business as a singer and announcer at radio station KMIC in Inglewood, California, in the mid-1920s. In late 1926, von Zell sang on the \"Times de Luxe Program\" on KHJ in Los Angeles, and was eventually employed as the manager of KMTR Los Angeles, moving to KGB San Diego in January 1929. Auditioning for Paul Whiteman's radio show later that year, he was chosen from a field of 250 announcers. When that series came to an end in 1930, he headed for New York and became a CBS staff announcer, working with Fred Allen, Phil Baker, Eddy Duchin and Ed Wynn. He also announced for \"The Aldrich Family\", \"The Amazing Mr. Smith\", and \"The March of Time\". During the 1920s and 1930s, von Zell served as announcer on some 20 shows a week.\n\nHis longest-running radio partnership was his nine seasons with veteran comedian Eddie Cantor. From October, 1940 to June, 1949 von Zell served as Cantor's commercial spokesperson and straight man. Then, as Cantor cast member Dinah Shore's solo career began to blossom, she brought von Zell in as announcer on her \"Birds Eye Open House\" program.\n\nAs a young announcer, von Zell made a memorable verbal slip in 1931 when he referred to U.S. President Herbert Hoover as \"Hoobert Heever\" during a live tribute on Hoover's birthday. Hoover was not present at this tribute. Von Zell's blooper came at the end of a lengthy summation of Hoover's career, during which von Zell had pronounced the President's name correctly several times. Some mistakenly believe Hoover was present when the incident occurred, because of a re-enactment fabricated by Kermit Schaefer for his \"Pardon My Blooper\" record album, a number of years later.\n\nVon Zell was the vocalist for the first recording session of Charlie Barnet's musical career. A session on October 9, 1933 has von Zell singing, \"I Want You, I Need You\" (which was remade on October 25, 1933), as well as \"What Is Sweeter (Than the Sweetness of 'I Love You')?\".\n\nIn 1941 von Zell sang on NBC's popular \"jam session\" program \"The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street\". He and three other staff announcers became an impromptu barbershop quartet, with von Zell offering commentary in a florid, Victorian style.\n\nAs an actor, von Zell appeared on the Joan Davis radio series as the love interest of the character played by Verna Felton. When he entered a room, Felton would often shout excitedly, \"Why, Mr. von Zellllllllllll!\" After this, von Zell headlined his own short-lived radio program, \"The Smiths of Hollywood\", which featured Arthur Treacher and Jan Ford (who would later become Howard Hughes' paramour under the name Terry Moore).\n\nAs a film actor, von Zell appeared in at least 28 features and in his own series of slapstick comedy shorts for Columbia Pictures (1946–50). His film debut came in 1943, when he provided the offscreen narration for four entries in the \"Flicker Flashbacks\" series of silent-film satires. His face was first seen on screen in feature films of 1945. His movies included \"The Saxon Charm\", \"Dear Wife\", \"Son of Paleface\", \"Two Flags West\", \"USS Teakettle\", and \"For Heaven's Sake\".\n\nVon Zell worked in the early days of television, in 1931 describing boxing matches on experimental television boxing broadcasts.\nNearly 20 years later, the exposure von Zell received from the Columbia comedies led to his being hired for television shows as the medium began to reach a mass audience. In early 1950, he had his first major television exposure as announcer and spokesman for Pabst Blue Ribbon beer on Jackie Gleason's \"The Life of Riley\". In September 1951, at the beginning of the second television season of \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", he replaced the first season's announcer Bill Goodwin, who had also announced for the Burns & Allen radio show for many years. Appearing under his own name (as Goodwin had), Harry von Zell continued to play the befuddled friend of the Burns family, and the show-within-a-show's announcer, until 1958, the year of Gracie Allen's retirement and the series' conclusion. Von Zell also appeared in an episode of \"McHale's Navy\" as Admiral Parker, the uncle of Tim Conway's character Ensign Parker.\n\nDuring the 1958-59 television season, von Zell continued working with George Burns on his short-lived 25-week NBC sitcom, \"The George Burns Show\". That same year he wrote the teleplays for four episodes of NBC's \"Wagon Train\", appearing in one of them. In 1959 he joined comedian George Gobel, announcing for his single-season half-hour program on CBS.\n\nHe appeared in the \"Perry Mason\" episodes \"The Case of the Ancient Romeo\" (1962), and as the murderer Sidney Hawes in \"The Case of the Libelous Locket\" (1963). He was also cast in an episode of NBC's western series, \"The Tall Man\". During 1960 and 1961 von Zell appeared in five episodes of the television series \"Bachelor Father\" as Frank Curtis, a good friend of Bentley Gregg (played by John Forsythe).\n\nVon Zell delivered the commentary on \"Celebrity Golf\", a series of half-hour, nine-hole golf matches made in 1960 with Sam Snead taking on such Hollywood celebrities as Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Bob Hope at Los Angeles golf courses such as Woodland Hills and Lakeside Country Club. Those matches were rerun in recent years on the Golf Channel. In his later years von Zell was a commercial spokesman for Los Angeles-based savings and loan association Home Savings of America. In 1976 he was one of the many leading radio announcers who participated in a television special, \"The Good Old Days of Radio\". He also appeared on an episode of \"Ellery Queen\" in 1975.\n\nVon Zell died of cancer November 21, 1981, aged 75, at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.\n\n\n"}

He was recognized as a promising banker early in his career. His first manager reported that the young Lambert was \"doing very well and seems to have a good grasp of his work. This boy has a good future.\" Promoted to Accountant in a Vancouver branch, he moved on to Brockville and then to the foreign exchange department at the Montreal main branch. He later observed that \"We always tried to read something into every move and it was generally thought that if you were selected to go to Montreal someone had noticed you.\" After service as a naval officer in the North Atlantic during World War II, Lambert became manager of the Yellowknife branch during the gold boom of the late 1940s, and then began a rapid rise through the ranks. He became Assistant General Manager in 1953 and was one of those most intimately involved in the negotiations for the merger of the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank in 1955. As General Manager of the new Toronto-Dominion Bank he managed the delicate business of uniting two corporate cultures and building a style and image for a renewed and ambitious organization.\n\nAllen Lambert became President of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) in 1960 and Chairman the following year. The bank was not in the first rank of financial institutions at the time, and he later recalled that \"we had all gone through a period of frustration at being smaller than the others, and not being quite able to compete fully.\" Over the eighteen years of Lambert's leadership, TD became Canada's fastest growing bank and a major presence on the international financial scene. Lambert toured the world seeking business opportunities, opening local offices, and building solid relationships with major clients. He was a tireless promoter of customer service, ensured that the Bank was an innovator in technology, and promoted progressive training and benefit programs for employees. He started TD's corporate art program and, as a centennial project in 1967, developed one of Canada's foremost collections of Inuit art. He combined a demanding life in business with a remarkable record of public and community service, chairing royal commissions and federal advisory bodies, serving as a member of international organizations, and acting as a frequent speaker and essayist on economic issues. Shortly before his retirement in 1978 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his contributions to national life.\n\nAllen Lambert's most visible achievement, and a source of great personal pride, was the construction of the Toronto Dominion Centre. He viewed it as a tangible statement of the Bank's position in the forefront of industry. After rejecting a number of design proposals, Lambert turned to the great German/American architect Mies van der Rohe to develop a plan for a complex of buildings that would revolutionize the Toronto landscape. Now considered a Mies masterwork, the Centre is a lasting testament to Lambert's vision and imagination. William Thorsell, CEO of the Royal Ontario Museum, wrote in a tribute to Allen Lambert: \"For those who build, it is not a question of whether a legacy remains, but what its quality is. In Athens, in the Yucatan, in Paris, architecture still speaks eloquently centuries after so much else of value is gone. In 1967, a banker insisted that Toronto be remembered with respect.\"\n\nIn 1976, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n"}

There she was repackaged as a technical wrestling master, and was pushed as a major star. She has been nicknamed \"ARSION no Shinjutsu\", or \"Arsion True Heart\". Forgoing the high-flying techniques of her run in Zenjo, her style in Arsion was centered on mat wrestling and submission holds derived from shoot wrestling, along with more elaborate lucha-inspired submissions.\n\nIn June 2005, she launched \"Ibuki\", a bi-monthly event series, with her intention to provide opportunities for young, up and coming wrestlers from different promotions to compete with each other and to challenge senior wrestlers like Yoshida herself. \"Ibuki\" has now gained high reputation among joshi puroresu fans in Japan.\n\nIn 2006, Yoshida was presented with the Cauliflower Alley Club's Future Legend Award, becoming only the second female after Cheerleader Melissa, to win this award.\n\nYoshida retired from professional wrestling on November 19, 2017, losing to her trainee Hiroyo Matsumoto in her final match.\nYoshida is the innovator of two finishing moves, an over-the-shoulder back-to-belly piledriver, which she calls the \"Air Raid Crash\" and a headscissors shoulder lock, which she has named the \"Spider Twist\".

Watson was signed by Tommy Docherty in a player exchange deal which involved Keith Pring, going to Notts County and the Millers paying £1,000. He was thrust into a relegation battle with Rotherham in 1967–68 which was unsuccessful which led to Docherty's departure. In came Jim McAnearney who installed him as club captain and continued to use him both in defence and up-front. After four seasons at Millmoor, making 141 appearances scoring 21 goals he caught the attention of Sunderland manager Alan Brown who paid £100,000 for his services in December 1970.\n\nAt Roker Park, Watson began at centre forward, which many believed hindered their chances of gaining promotion. It was not until Bob Stokoe took over in November 1972 that Watson began to play at centre back and it paid off with Sunderland reaching the 1973 FA Cup Final where they beat First Division Leeds United 1–0. Watson was singled out for praise from Stokoe after the match for keeping Leeds's strike pairing of Allan Clarke and Mick Jones quiet. Following Sunderland's cup success the expectation was now for the club to gain promotion but they missed out by two points in both 1973–74 and 1974–75.\n\nIn the summer of 1975, Watson joined First Division Manchester City for a fee of £175,000 in a deal which saw Jeff Clarke move the other way. Watson spent four seasons at Maine Road which saw Man City miss out on the title in 1976–77 by one point. They did win the League Cup in 1976 beating Newcastle United 2–1. He left Manchester City in the summer of 1979 for German Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. His time at Bremen was short as after making his debut in a 1–0 win over Bayer Uerdingen he was sent off in his second match against 1860 Munich for \"pushing\" Hermann Bitz and banned by the German FA for eight weeks. He was fined by his club and refused to travel to an away match against FC Schalke 04 because of an injury before turning up to play for England.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he was back in England by October with Southampton paying £200,000. Watson played 31 games in 1979–80 and 44 games in 1980–81 as the Saints finished 8th and 6th respectively. However, he was dropped by Lawrie McMenemy during the next season and he joined Stoke City in January 1982. He played 24 times for Stoke in 1981–82 helping them to avoid relegation. He then played 40 times in 1982–83 as Stoke finished in a mid-table position of 13th. Watson then spent the summer of 1983 with the Vancouver Whitecaps before ending his career with a season each at Derby County and his first club Notts County.\n\nWatson's performances at Centre Half for Sunderland were noticed at the highest level and less than a year after the FA Cup win and despite playing in the Second Division he was given his debut for England in a friendly game against Portugal in Lisbon. Watson – quite advanced in years for a debutant at 27 – was one of six first-timers on show (among the others were Trevor Brooking) in what would prove to be 1966 World Cup-winning manager Alf Ramsey's last game in charge. Later in 1974, Watson won his second cap in a 2–0 defeat by Scotland at Hampden Park, Glasgow, coming on as a substitute for Norman Hunter. His first competitive game at international level was his seventh appearance in all as England defeated Czechoslovakia 3–0 at Wembley in a qualifier for the 1976 European Championships. Despite this scoreline, England would not ultimately qualify for the finals while the Czechoslovak team would go on to win it. He played every minute of England's fixtures that year, including World Cup qualifying victories over Luxembourg (twice) and Italy, though after the Italians had earlier defeated England in the campaign and had a better goals record against Luxembourg. England missed out on the finals for a second successive tournament. Watson did not miss another England game until 1980.\n\nDuring the same year, Watson's establishment as England's first choice central defender was galvanised by a 4–3 victory over Denmark in Copenhagen which set the seal on a qualification for the 1980 European Championships – England's first major tournament qualification for a decade. Watson continued his England career, earning his 50th cap against Argentina in a warm-up game prior to the European Championships in Italy. Watson duly played in all three of England's group games – against Belgium, Italy and Spain – but a draw, defeat and victory respectively was not enough for England to progress. His final appearance for England came against Iceland in June 1982 having gained 65 caps. He was excluded from the squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with manager Ron Greenwood selecting only three specialist central defenders, Phil Thompson, Terry Butcher and Steve Foster. Watson remains the most-capped England player never to play in a World Cup finals match.\n\nIn February 2020, it was reported that Watson, aged 73, was suffering from a neurodegenerative disease with his wife suspecting that \"head injuries and repeated heading of the ball\" were the cause.\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\n"}

Although village-sized, with a current population of around 5,023, increasing to 5,519 at the 2011 census for the electoral ward population which includes Countess Wear, which is its own individual settlement, Topsham was designated a town by a 1300 royal charter, until the Exeter urban district was formed. It is served by Topsham railway station on the branch line to Exmouth. In 2011 was the 150th anniversary of the railway coming to Topsham, on what is now called the Exeter–Exmouth Avocet Line.\n\nThe native Celtic settlement of Topsham became the port of the Roman city of Isca Dumnoniorum (Exeter) in the first century AD, and continued to serve it until the Roman occupation of southern Britain ceased about the year 400. In the 7th century the Saxon rule in East Devon saw the settlement grow into a considerable village.\n\nSt Margaret's Anglican Church in Topsham, dates back to the 10th century. Although reconstructed several times, it remains in its original location as granted in 937 by King Athelstan, who gave \"a parcel of land, i.e. a manse, which the vulgar called Toppesham, to the monastery Church of St Mary and St Peter in Exeter, for the cure of his soul, to have in eternal freedom so long as the Christian Church shall endure.\"\n\nTopsham's position, offering a sheltered harbour to seagoing trade enabled it to thrive as a port, a centre for both fishing and shipbuilding. Notable ships such as HMS \"Terror\" (part of Franklin's lost expedition) and (later known as the USS \"Cyane\" after capture by the American Navy) were built here in the early 19th century. The town was the scene of a notable Parliamentarian naval assault during the English Civil War.\n\nThere are many Dutch style houses in Topsham dating from the time when Topsham was an important cotton port. Many of Topsham's houses are built using Dutch bricks, which were brought over as ballast from Holland – to where the wool and cotton from South-West England had been exported.\n\nTopsham was absorbed into the City of Exeter, along with the parishes of Alphington and Pinhoe, in 1966.\n\nAfter a period of decline over the first half of the 20th century, Topsham has increasingly become a desirable and high-value residential location. The 21st century has seen development into the 'Topsham Gap' – greenfield land between Topsham and Exeter.\n\nFormerly a major seaport, the town is now of interest for its architecture, scenery and proximity to nature reserves for wading and migrating birds, such as RSPB Bowling Green Marsh on the Exe Estuary, the whole of which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\n\nTopsham Museum is located in one of a set of 17th century buildings looking out over the Exe Estuary. It consists of furnished period rooms, displays of the local history of the town and memorabilia of Vivien Leigh, the film star.\n\nThe name is an Anglo-Saxon one, and means Toppa's village, Toppa having been the local landowner.\n\nThere is some difference of opinion on the correct pronunciation of the town. Generally it is referred to as with the \"sh\" sounded as in \"shoe\". The local pronunciation amongst older native Devonians, however, is with the s being sounded as in \"some\" and the -ham suffix being reduced to \"um\".\n\nTopsham's local football club is Topsham Town AFC, a non-league side in Devon. Topsham Rugby Club has two senior sides and over 200 juniors making it one of the largest \"junior\" clubs in the South West. The town also has a bowling club, an outdoor swimming pool and a sailing club.\n\nOne of the main focal points of the town is Topsham Pool. Topsham Pool is a community run project in the centre of the town. It was funded by a large fundraising exercise in the 1970s which included collecting waste paper and glass bottles, jumble sales and donations. A Sports Council grant completed the fund raising effort and, in 1979, the pool was opened by Olympic gold medallist swimmer David Wilkie. Topsham Pool is an open-air pool and, as a result, is only open between May and September. Between 6 am and 8.30 am each morning, the Pool welcomes the Nutters Club – a group that swims when the outside temperature is likely to be at its coolest.\n\nIn response to what had been described in the early 1960s as \"a period of genteel decline\", The Topsham Society was formed. The objectives of the Topsham Society are \"To promote high standards of planning and architecture in or affecting Topsham; to educate the public in the geography, history, natural history and architecture of Topsham; to secure the preservation protection development and improvement of features of historic or public interest in Topsham\". The Society currently has around 400 members.\n\nA monthly magazine is published called \"Estuary: A Monthly Community Magazine for Topsham\", which is published by St Margaret's Anglican Church, but is more of a community publication than an ecclesiastical one. It is currently priced £0.70 per month, and copy to be received by the 15th of the preceding month. It is co-edited by Diana Trout and José Northey.\n\nTwice a year Estuary Players present a theatrical production in the Matthews Hall. They are a notably eclectic group, but Shakespeare and Brecht have featured among their favourite playwrights over their 35-year existence.\n\nTopsham Art Group had a summer exhibition in 2012 at the local Topsham Primary School featuring local artists.; A community hall called \"Matthews Hall\" where local group can meet, including the Topsham Community Association; Topsham Film Club; Topsham Flower Club;\n\n2011 marked the 80th anniversary of the Topsham Town Fayre and Carnival.\n\nIn addition to St Margaret's Anglican church, there is also a Methodist church, situated in Fore Street; a Congregational Church situated in Victoria Road; and a Roman Catholic church, dedicated to the Holy Cross, which meets in Station Road.\n\nThe Bridge Inn is a Grade II listed public house at Bridge Hill, that dates to the 18th century. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.\n\nWilliam Webb Follett, the noted lawyer and parliamentarian, was born here in 1796. \nGeneral George Warren (cir 1801–1884) was born here . \nThomas Hardy's cousin, Tryphena Sparks, who was the inspiration for Hardy's poem \"Thoughts of Phena at News of Her Death\" lived here and is buried here. She was known locally for the charitable work she did for the local fishermen. Dick Pym, the footballer, was born here in 1893; he was a goalkeeper in the first Wembley FA Cup Final in 1923, and died in Exeter in 1988, aged 95. The newsreader, Trevor McDonald, is a past resident of the town, and both members of the folk group Show of Hands live in Topsham. Clifford Fishwick artist and principal of Exeter College of Art and Design lived here until his death in 1997. Novelist Philip Hensher also lives here. His 2011 book \"King of the Badgers\" is set in a fictional town based on Topsham.

Her poetry has been published in a number of collections and anthologies, and she has also published essays, children's books, and plays. She is the pioneer of Limited Fork Theory, a literary theory concerned with the limitations and capacity of human understanding of art.\n\nMoss was born Thylias Rebecca Brasier, in a working-class family in Ohio. Her father chose the name Thylias because he decided she needed a name that had not existed before. According to Moss, her first few years of life were happy, living with her family in the upstairs rooms of an older Jewish couple named Feldman (who Moss believes were Holocaust survivors). The Feldmans treated Moss like a grandchild.\n\nWhen Moss was five, the Feldmans sold their house and moved away. Her parents continued to live in the house with the new homeowners and their 13-year-old daughter, Lytta, who began to baby-sit Moss after school. Moss experienced constant harassment from Lytta and several traumatic events before the age of nine. She later said about her trauma: \"I never said a word of this to anybody...I was there witnessing things that only happened when I left that house.\"\n\nAt age nine her family relocated, causing her to be sent to school in a predominantly white district. After enduring bullying and racism from both her peers and teachers, she withdrew from social interaction at school and did not speak freely in classes until many years later in college. It was during this time she gave more attention to writing poetry, an activity she had begun two years earlier.\n\nMoss married at age 16 before attending Syracuse University from 1971 to 1973. She eventually left university due to racial tensions and entered the workforce for several years. During this time she had two sons, Dennis and Ansted. She enrolled in Oberlin College in 1979 and graduated with a BA in 1981. She later received a Master of Arts in English, with an emphasis on writing, from the University of New Hampshire.\n\nAfter finishing school, Moss taught English at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Since 1993, she has been a Professor of English and a Professor of Art and Design at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nHer early work is considered part of the legacy of the Black Arts Movement, taking influence from West African praise poetry and concerning themes of racial justice. Throughout her career, her work has become more experimental, stretching the boundaries of genre and the definition of poetry. Her fixations still include justice, but she expanded into a fascination with text placement's effect on meaning. These experiments with form culminated in her development of Limited Fork Theory and the invention of the POAM (product of act of making). Moss's POAMs are combinations of film and poetry, emphasizing how text placement and movement, among other sensory elements, can enhance the meaning of a poem.\n\nMoss contributed to experimental literary theory by introducing the metaphor of a fork to conceptualize how people internalize art and literature. The fork as a metaphor for understanding represents bifurcation, and Moss argues that the branching out of the mind to understand art mimics the branching tines of a fork. She uses the word \"limited\" to express that, though an observer gains understanding of art through these bifurcated systems of comprehension, the same systems limit their understanding. Just as one can only eat that which adheres to the tines of a fork, one can only internalize the facets of a piece of art that adhere to these bifurcated tines of understanding.\n\nThe development of Moss's POAMs (products of acts of making) coincided with her theoretical development of Limited Fork. These multimedia pieces use as many sensory elements as possible, including movement, color, and sound. Moss has also expressed interest in incorporating olfactory elements in future projects. These POAMS are usually displayed in galleries, but many can be found online in podcasts, journals, and on YouTube.\n\nThe complexities associated with the epistemological application of Limited Fork Theory caused Moss to adopt the persona of Forker Girl/Forker Gryle, pseudonyms under which she runs blogs and an Instagram account explaining details of both her life and her theory.\n\nPoetry\n\nProse\n\nAwards\n\n"}

It is a form of optical aberration.\n\nAlthough distortion can be irregular or follow many patterns, the most commonly encountered distortions are radially symmetric, or approximately so, arising from the symmetry of a photographic lens. These \"radial distortions\" can usually be classified as either \"barrel\" distortions or \"pincushion\" distortions. See van Walree.\n\nMathematically, barrel and pincushion distortion are quadratic, meaning they increase as the \"square\" of distance from the center. In mustache distortion the quartic (degree 4) term is significant: in the center, the degree 2 barrel distortion is dominant, while at the edge the degree 4 distortion in the pincushion direction dominates. Other distortions are in principle possible – pincushion in center and barrel at the edge, or higher order distortions (degree 6, degree 8) – but do not generally occur in practical lenses, and higher order distortions are small relative to the main barrel and pincushion effects.\n\nIn photography, distortion is particularly associated with zoom lenses, particularly large-range zooms, but may also be found in prime lenses, and depends on focal distance – for example, the Canon EF 50mm 1.4 exhibits barrel distortion at extremely short focal distances. Barrel distortion may be found in wide-angle lenses, and is often seen at the wide-angle end of zoom lenses, while pincushion distortion is often seen in older or low-end telephoto lenses. Mustache distortion is observed particularly on the wide end of zooms, with certain retrofocus lenses, and more recently on large-range zooms such as the Nikon 18–200 mm.\n\nA certain amount of pincushion distortion is often found with visual optical instruments, e.g., binoculars, where it serves to eliminate the globe effect.\nIn order to understand these distortions, it should be remembered that these are \"radial\" defects; the optical systems in question have rotational symmetry (omitting non-radial defects), so the didactically correct test image would be a set of concentric circles having even separation—like a shooter's target. It will then be observed that these common distortions actually imply a nonlinear radius mapping from the object to the image: What is seemingly pincushion distortion, is actually simply an exaggerated radius mapping for large radii in comparison with small radii. A graph showing radius transformations (from object to image) will be steeper in the upper (rightmost) end. Conversely, barrel distortion is actually a diminished radius mapping for large radii in comparison with small radii. A graph showing radius transformations (from object to image) will be less steep in the upper (rightmost) end.\n\nRadial distortion that depends on wavelength is called \"lateral chromatic aberration\" – \"lateral\" because radial, \"chromatic\" because dependent on color (wavelength). This can cause colored fringes in high-contrast areas in the outer parts of the image. This should not be confused with \"axial\" (longitudinal) chromatic aberration, which causes aberrations throughout the field, particularly purple fringing.\n\nThe names for these distortions come from familiar objects which are visually similar.\nRadial distortion, whilst primarily dominated by low order radial components, can be corrected using Brown's distortion model, also known as the Brown–Conrady model based on earlier work by Conrady. The Brown–Conrady model corrects both for radial distortion and for tangential distortion caused by physical elements in a lens not being perfectly aligned. The latter is also known as \"decentering distortion\". See Zhang for additional discussion of radial distortion.\n\nwhere:\n\nBarrel distortion typically will have a negative term for formula_13 whereas pincushion distortion will have a positive value. Moustache distortion will have a non-monotonic radial geometric series where for some formula_10 the sequence will change sign.\n\nTo model radial distortion, the division model typically provides a more accurate approximation than Brown-Conrady's even-order polynomial model:\n\nusing the same parameters previously defined. For radial distortion, this division model is often preferred over the Brown–Conrady model, as it requires fewer terms to describe more accurately severe distortion. Using this model, a single term is usually sufficient to model most cameras.\n\nSoftware can correct those distortions by warping the image with a reverse distortion. This involves determining which distorted pixel corresponds to each undistorted pixel, which is non-trivial due to the non-linearity of the distortion equation. Lateral chromatic aberration (purple/green fringing) can be significantly reduced by applying such warping for red, green and blue separately.\n\nDistorting or undistorting requires either both sets of coefficients or inverting the non-linear problem which, in general, lacks an analytical solution. Standard approaches such as approximating, locally linearizing and iterative solvers all apply. Which solver is preferable depends on the accuracy required and the computational resources available.\n\nCalibrated systems work from a table of lens/camera transfer functions:\n\nManual systems allow manual adjustment of distortion parameters:\nBesides these systems that address images, there are some that also adjust distortion parameters for videos:\n\nRadial distortion is a failure of a lens to be rectilinear: a failure to image lines into lines. If a photograph is not taken straight-on then, even with a perfect rectilinear lens, rectangles will appear as trapezoids: lines are imaged as lines, but the angles between them are not preserved (tilt is not a conformal map). This effect can be controlled by using a perspective control lens, or corrected in post-processing.\n\nDue to perspective, cameras image a cube as a square frustum (a truncated pyramid, with trapezoidal sides)—the far end is smaller than the near end. This creates perspective, and the rate at which this scaling happens (how quickly more distant objects shrink) creates a sense of a scene being deep or shallow. This cannot be changed or corrected by a simple transform of the resulting image, because it requires 3D information, namely the depth of objects in the scene. This effect is known as perspective distortion; the image itself is not distorted, but is perceived as distorted when viewed from a normal viewing distance.\n\nNote that if the center of the image is closer than the edges (for example, a straight-on shot of a face), then barrel distortion and wide-angle distortion (taking the shot from close) both increase the size of the center, while pincushion distortion and telephoto distortion (taking the shot from far) both decrease the size of the center. However, radial distortion bends straight lines (out or in), while perspective distortion does not bend lines, and these are distinct phenomena. Fisheye lenses are wide-angle lenses with heavy barrel distortion and thus exhibit \"both\" these phenomena, so objects in the center of the image (if shot from a short distance) are particularly enlarged: even if the barrel distortion is corrected, the resulting image is still from a wide-angle lens, and will still have a wide-angle perspective.\n\n\n"}

This was in contrast with kings of France who always wore an open crown. However, there is academic debate on how often closed crowns were used in England during this period, as the first unequivocal use of the closed crown was by Henry IV at his coronation on 13 October 1399. However his effigy on his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral wears an open crown so the link in England between the style of the crown and its representation as that worn by a king and an emperor was not established. The use of a closed crown may have been adopted by the English as a way of distinguishing the English crown from the French crown, but it also had other meanings to some. For example, Henry V wore a helmet-crown of the arched type at the Battle of Agincourt which the French knight St. Remy commented was \"like the imperial crown\".\n\nThe association of the closed crown with imperial crowns was already established in Continental Europe by the late 14th century, for example the florins minted for Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor) sometimes show him with a closed crown (though on the commoner variety, the crown is open). A miniature picture in the \"Chronica Aulae Regiae\" written in the great abbey outside Prague depicts his mother Elizabeth, a queen of Bohemia, wearing an open crown, while his two wives, who had imperial titles, have closed ones.\n\nDuring the machinations that surrounded the introduction of the imperial crown under Henry VIII (see the section below Legal usage), the closed crown, became associated as a symbolic representation of the English Crown as an imperial crown, and has remained so until this day.\n\nThe Silk Imperial Crown of Russia was used as an official coronation gift of the Russian Empire for the coronation of Nicholas II, the last Emperor of the Romanov line. Nicholas II was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift. It was not intended as ceremonial regalia, but as private Imperial property - a memento to his coronation event.\n\nA list of prominent examples of depictions of imperial crowns displayed atop heraldic achievements or as heraldic charge includes:\n\nBecause Pope Clement VII would not grant Henry VIII of England an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the English Parliament passed the Act in Restraint of Appeals (1533) in which it was explicitly stated that\nThe next year the Act of Supremacy (1534) explicitly tied the headship of the church to the imperial crown:\n\nDuring the reign of Mary I the First Act of Supremacy was annulled, but during the reign of Elizabeth I the Second Act of Supremacy, with similar wording to the First Act, was passed in 1559. During the English Interregnum the laws were annulled, but the acts which caused the laws to be in abeyance were themselves, deemed to be null and void by the Parliaments of the English Restoration, so by act of Parliament \"The Crown\" of England and (later the British and UK crowns) are imperial crowns.\n\n"}

There is one species of \"Aquifex\" with a validly published name - \"A. pyrophilus\" - but \"\"A. aeolicus\"\" is sometimes considered as species though it has no standing as a name given it has not been validly or effectively published. \"Aquifex\" spp. are extreme thermophiles, growing best at temperature of 85 °C to 95 °C. They are members of the \"Bacteria\" as opposed to the other inhabitants of extreme environments, the Archaea.\n\n\"Aquifex\" spp. are rod-shaped bacteria with a length of 2 to 6 µm, have a diameter of around 0.5 µm and are motile. They are non-sporeforming, Gram negative autotrophs. \"Aquifex\" means \"water-maker\" in Latin, and refers to the fact that its method of respiration creates water. \"Aquifex\" tend to form cell aggregates composed of up to 100 individual cells.\n\n\"Aquifex\" spp. are thermophilic and often grow near underwater volcanoes or hot springs. \"A. aeolicus\" requires oxygen to survive, but can grow in levels of oxygen as low as 7.5 ppm. \"A. pyrophilus\" can even grow anaerobically by reducing nitrogen instead of oxygen. Like other thermophilic bacteria, \"Aquifex\" has important uses in industrial processes.\n\nThe genome of \"\"A. aeolicus\"\" has been completed. This was made easier by the fact that the length of the genome is only about a third of the length of the genome for \"E. coli\". Comparison of the \"A. aeolicus\" genome to other organisms showed that around 16% of its genes originated from the Archaea domain. Members of this genus are thought to be some of the earliest members of the eubacteria domain.\n\n\"\"A. aeolicus\"\" was discovered north of Sicily, while \"A. pyrophilus\" was first found just north of Iceland.\n\nThe complete genome for \"A. aeolicus\" consists of 1,551,335 base pairs with over 1500 open reading frames (ORFs) or chromosomal coding sequences. An extremely large portion (over 90%) of the genome are protein-coding regions and there are no significant non-coding repeats. though the \"A. aeolicus\" genome is dense, many enzyme subunits used for respiration processes are found in separate operons. Any repairs to the genome are done by a protein like DNA polymerase beta found in most eukaryotes.\n\n\"Aquifex\" respiration and fixation pathways use similar pathways to that of other autotrophic bacteria. Carbon fixation is done using the reductive TCA cycle and forms acetyl-CoA as well as many other bio-synthetic materials. Many bacterium use products from the TCA cycle in the pentose-phosphate pathway and Entner-Doudoroff pathway or Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway however, many enzymes that are necessary for these gluconeogenic processes have not been identified in \"A. aeolicus\" suggesting a different pathway might be used.\n\n\"A. aeolicus\" needs oxygen at concentrations higher than 7.5 p.p.m to preform respiration while \"A. pyrophilus\" is capable of respiration with nitrogen however, both species have a nitrate reductase and nitrate transporter genes located within their genome. the enzymes used in other bacterium for oxygen respiration are used by \"Aquifex\". Many other oxidoreductases are present however their physiological role is unknown. \"Aquifex\" oxides thiosulfate, molecular hydrogen, and sulfur within their respiratory pathway.\n\nPhylogenetic trees that are based on small subunit rRNA suggest that \"Aquificales\" are some of the earliest bacteria that branched from Archaea. However, phylogenetic trees based on protein contradict this argument. The exact phylogeny is hard to determine because of this and the many horizontal gene transfers within the lineage. These factors lead many to believe the phylum of \"Aquifex\" is basal next to \"Thermotogae\", another hyperthermophilic phylum, or are a part of the Epsilonproteobacteria, a highly diverse group of hydrothermal dwelling species.\n\n\"A. aeolicus\" is used as a model organism for hyperthermophilic bacterium. Many studies have looked at the \"Aquifex\" hydrogenases ability to preform the reversible oxidation of dihydrogen (the oxidation reaction) at extremely high temperatures. The success of the properties within the hydrogenases of \"Aquifex\" mark the genus as a possible renewable bio-catalysts for hydrogen based fuel cells.\n\n"}

Watt in 1974; recognizers were developed at the University of Nijmegen between 1985 and 1995. The EAG compiler developed there will generate either a recogniser, a transducer, a translator, or a syntax directed editor for a language described in the EAG formalism. The formalism is quite similar to Prolog, to the extent that it borrowed its cut operator.\n\nEAGs have been used to write grammars of natural languages such as English, Spanish, and Hungarian. The aim was to verify the grammars by making them parse corpora of text (corpus linguistics); hence, parsing had to be sufficiently practical. However, the parse tree explosion problem that ambiguities in natural language tend to produce in this type of approach is worsened for EAGs because each choice of affix value may produce a separate parse, even when several different values are equivalent. The remedy proposed was to switch to the much simpler Affix Grammar over a Finite Lattice (AGFL) instead, in which metagrammars can only produce simple finite languages.\n\n\n"}

He passed the lower examination at the regular triennial administration in 1438. He soon gained the favor of King Sejong, and was appointed to the Hall of Worthies. From 1442 to 1446, he cooperated with other members of that body to compose the \"Hunmin Jeongeum\", in which the hangul alphabet was first presented to the world. The level of his involvement in the creation of the Korean alphabet Hangul (and that of other Hall of Worthies scholars) is disputed, although he and other scholars were sent on trips to consult with a Ming Chinese phoneticist several times, presumably because one of the first uses the new alphabet was put to was to transcribe the sounds of hanja, or Sino-Korean characters.

Training and service agreements were part of White's marketing package that Hamilton would carry over to EMC. Aware of the needs of branch line services of railroads and the opportunities provided with GE's new internal combustion-electric propulsion and control technology, he quit his position with White and set up shop in a Chicago hotel with his partner and a designer to develop and market a new generation of self-propelled railcars. In 1923 EMC sold two gasoline-powered rail motor cars, one to the Chicago Great Western and the other to the Northern Pacific. EMC subcontracted the body construction to St. Louis Car Company, electrical components to General Electric, and the prime mover to the Winton Engine Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The motorcars were delivered in 1924 and worked well, fortunate for the fledgling company, because the sales were conditional on satisfactory performance. In 1925 EMC entered full-scale production, selling 27 railcars.\n\nIn 1930 General Motors (GM) was seeking to enter production of diesel engines and broaden their range of applications. They purchased the Winton Engine Company, who had in their product line a variety of stationary and marine diesel engines and spark-ignition engines for heavy vehicles. GM saw EMC's role in developing and marketing Winton-engined heavy vehicles as fitting their objectives and purchased the company shortly after the Winton acquisition, renaming it Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC). Supported by the GM Research Division headed by Charles F. Kettering, GM's Winton Engine Corporation focused on developing diesel engines with improved power-to-weight ratios and output flexibility suitable for mobile use. Eugene W. Kettering, son of Charles Kettering, led Winton's side of the development project.\n\nIn 1933 EMC designed the power setups for the \"Zephyr\" and \"M-10000\" streamliners, a breakthrough in the power and speed available with their propulsion systems. The \"Zephyr\" used the first major product of the new GM-Winton venture, a 600 hp, eight cylinder version of the Winton 201A Roots blown, uniflow scavenged, unit injected, 2-stroke diesel engine. As the Budd and Pullman-Standard companies entered contracts to build more diesel-powered streamliners, they became major customers for EMC. Diesel power had been shown suitable for small, lightweight, high speed trains, in addition to its more established role in yard service.\n\nSeeing opportunities to broaden the role of diesel in railroading, EMC invested in a new locomotive factory and started development work on the locomotives that it would produce. The factory headquarters on 55th Street in McCook, Illinois, west of Chicago, remains the corporate headquarters. The 1935 EMC 1800 hp B-B development design locomotives featured the multiple-unit control systems that became the basis of cab/booster locomotive sets, and the twin engine format that would be adopted for the newest \"Zephyr\" power units in 1936 and EMC's E series streamlined passenger locomotives that their new factory began producing in 1937. Prior to their introduction of the E units EMC was in production of switch engines, which remained the mainstay of their production until dieselization of freight and passenger service hit full stride in the mid-1940s.\n\nThe GM-Winton research and development effort continued through the mid-1930s, building on experience with the Winton 201A, to develop diesel engines to better meet the specific needs of locomotive use. The fruit of that effort was GM's new 567 engine, introduced by their renamed Cleveland Diesel Engine Division in 1938. The new engine upgraded the horsepower of EMC's E series locomotives to 2000 per locomotive unit and increased reliability substantially. Also in 1938, EMC increased its reach up the chain of locomotive production by transitioning from General Electric equipment to in-house produced generators and traction motors. With Eugene Kettering moving to EMC that year, EMC moved into a leading role in further development of GM's locomotive engines.\n\nGM-Winton-EMC's long development efforts put the company in an advantageous position relative to other developers of diesel-electric locomotion. Their nearest competitor was the American Locomotive Company (ALCO), who had produced diesel-electric switch engines since the mid-1920s, provided motive power for the \"Rebel\" streamliner trainsets in 1935, and started production of development design locomotives to compete with the E-units in 1939. EMC's other main competitor, the Baldwin Locomotive Works, had their development work with diesel delayed by their belief through 1930s that the future of mainline service remained with steam, and by financial difficulties that effectively froze their diesel development while EMC and ALCO continued theirs. Baldwin started producing diesel-electric switch engines in 1939.\n\nPassenger trains made little money for the railroads, but replacement of steam engines with reliable diesel units could provide railroads with a crucial difference for profitability. With standardized production of locomotives, EMC simplified the processes for ordering, manufacturing, and servicing locomotives and introduced economies of scale that would lower unit costs. EMC offered support services including financing, training, and field maintenance that would ease the transition from steam to diesel and boost their market in the last years before US entry into World War II. The performance of the new 567 engine in passenger locomotives also built confidence in the viability of diesel power for freight service.\n\nIn 1939 the company built a four-unit freight locomotive demonstrator, the FT, and began a tour of the continent's railroads. The tour was a success. Western railroads in particular saw that the diesels could free them from dependence on scarce water supplies for steam locomotives. In 1940, after incorporating dynamic braking at the suggestion of customers, they were receiving their first orders for the new freight locomotive.\n\nGeneral Motors moved production of locomotive engines under the authority of EMC to create the GM Electro-Motive Division (EMD) on January 1, 1941. With that move, EMD became a fully self-contained development, production, marketing, and service entity. Nonlocomotive products (large marine and stationary diesel engines) continued under GM's Cleveland Diesel Engine Division for another twenty years.\n\nIn January 1941 EMD delivered the first FT unit to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, numbered Unit 100, and through that year they were in full-stride production of road and switch locomotives. World War II temporarily slowed EMD's locomotive production; Navy ships gained priority for diesel power and the petroleum crisis of 1942-43 made coal-fired steam a more attractive option. The War Production Board stopped production of new passenger equipment between September 1942 and December 1944. Later in the war, diesel locomotive production for freight service was picking up as more locomotives were needed to haul wartime supplies. By the time the FT model was replaced in 1945, 555 cab units and 541 booster units had been produced.\n\nEMD emerged from the war years with major advantages for over competitors in diesel locomotive production, having entered them with fully developed lines of mainline road diesel locomotives while war production allocations restricted their competitors, principally the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the Baldwin Locomotive Works, to selling mainly diesel switchers and steam locomotives of pre-existing designs. That gave an advantage to EMD's state of technical development with higher powered diesels in the critical postwar years. New model passenger locomotives were delivered starting in February 1945. New models of their freight locomotive followed later in 1945 and 1946.\n\nBy the late 1940s the vast majority of American railroads had decided to dieselize their locomotive fleets. Passenger services facing increasing competition from air and automotive travel rapidly replaced steam for image and cost reasons, but the biggest growth market was for freight locomotives. To meet post-war demands, EMD opened another locomotive production facility in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1948.\n\nALCO-GE was EMD's strongest competitor during the dieselization era, having produced the first road-switcher diesel locomotives in 1941 and gained about a 26% market share of diesel locomotives, mostly for switching and short-haul applications, as of 1946. ALCO's higher-powered locomotives for mainline service were less successful, as they were plagued by reliability problems. In 1948 the ALCO-GE partnership developed a prototype gas-turbine-electric locomotive; series production began in 1952. Latecomers to the diesel locomotive business Baldwin, Fairbanks-Morse, and Lima-Hamilton struggled in the market as their products failed to gain a solid reputation. By 1950 it was clear that EMD's competitors could not crack their position in mainline road diesels and in 1949 their new EMD GP7 road switcher locomotive invaded the market niche previously held by ALCO and Baldwin. In 1950, EMD's new plant in London, Ontario, Canada, began production. The plant was operated by the Canadian subsidiary General Motors Diesel (GMD), producing existing EMD as well as unique GMD designs for the Canadian domestic and export markets.\nEMD's road-switcher locomotives with power and reliability sufficient for mainline use overturned the market for freight locomotives, soon displacing their competitors' road-switchers, then later their own F-series carbody locomotives. The GP9 became the most-produced EMD model ever, with 4,112 A units and 165 B units sold between 1954 and 1963. Owing to their ease of maintenance and versatility, most locomotives sold in North America since the introduction of the GP9 have been road-switcher, or \"hood\", units. Flush-sided locomotives based on a road-switcher chassis, or \"cowl\" units, would later be produced for passenger service.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s, more difficult market conditions followed the peak demand of the dieselization era. The 1950s saw collapse in the positions of all of EMD's established competitors and the strong emergence of a new one, the General Electric Company. Lima-Hamilton failed first, in 1951 merging with Baldwin to form Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. Baldwin's own position was precarious, with their market share dwindling until they left the locomotive business in 1956. Fairbanks-Morse, after struggling to maintain a foothold in the industry with their opposed piston marine powerplant, left the locomotive field in 1963. General Electric dissolved the ALCO-GE partnership in the wake of ALCO's lackluster efforts at developing reliable higher-powered engines, and took over the ALCO-GE gas-turbine-electric venture in 1953. In 1956 GE was marketing its own Universal series Cooper-Bessemer powered diesel-electrics as export locomotives. ALCO's belated introduction of improved locomotive power in 1956 provided the company little benefit; they no longer had the marketing, financing, or service support of GE and the GP9 was a formidable competitor in the saturated domestic market. In 1960 the U25B was the first of GE's road locomotives powered by their FDL-16 diesel engine, which would rapidly displace ALCO's position and eventually displace EMD's position in the domestic market. Competition from the two giants with large capital resources overwhelmed ALCO until they went out of business in 1969.\n\nThe 567 engine was continuously improved and upgraded. The original six-cylinder 567 produced , the V-12 , and the V-16 . EMD began turbocharging the 567 around 1958; the final version, the 567D3A (built from October, 1963, to about January, 1966) produced in its V-16 form.\n\nAs the 1960s opened EMD was compelled to respond to the challenge offered by GE's U25B, upgrading the features of their GP (General Purpose) and SD (Special Duty/Standard Duty) series locomotives, boosting the power of their 567 engines, then developing the more powerful 645 engines. Those endeavors as well as the feature upgrades introduced with the SD40-2 were sufficient to maintain EMD's competitive advantage over GE until the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1962 GM moved their remaining production of large nonlocomotive diesel engines from Cleveland to the EMD facility in McCook, ending the existence of the Cleveland diesel Engine Division.\n\nIn late 1965, EMD introduced the enlarged 645 engine. Power ratings were V-12 nonturbocharged, V-8 turbocharged, V-12 turbocharged, V-16 nonturbocharged, and V-16 turbocharged. In late 1965 EMD built their first twenty-cylinder engine, a turbocharged V20 for the EMD SD45. The final variant of the sixteen cylinder 645 (the 16-645F) produced .\n\nIn 1972, EMD introduced modular control systems with the \"Dash-2\" line; the EMD SD40-2 became one of the most successful diesel locomotive designs in history, both in terms of sales and service longevity. A total of 3,945 SD40-2 units were built.\n\nEMD introduced their new 710 engine in 1984 with the 60 Series locomotives (EMD SD60 and EMD GP60), the EMD 645 engine continued to be offered in certain models (such as the 50 Series) until 1988. The 710 is produced as an eight-, twelve-, sixteen-, and twenty-cylinder engine for locomotive, marine and stationary applications. Concurrently with the introduction of the 710, EMD's control systems on locomotives changed to microprocessors, with computer-controlled wheel slip prevention, among other systems.\n\n EMD's North American market share dropped below that of its main competitor General Electric in 1987. After the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1989, EMD decided to consolidate all locomotive production at the Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada (formerly GMD) plant in London, Ontario, a development which ended locomotive production at the La Grange, Illinois plant in 1991, although the Illinois facility continued to produce engines and generators.\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s EMD introduced AC induction motor drive in EMD locomotives using Siemens technology. In the early 1990s, EMD introduced the radial steering truck, which reduced wheel and track wear. In 1995 EMD replaced mechanical unit injectors with electronically controlled unit injectors on its 710 engines.\n\nIn 1998 EMD introduced the four-stroke sixteen cylinder 265H-Engine, used as the prime mover in the EMD SD90MAC-H locomotive. Instead of completely replacing the 710 series engine, the H-engine was concurrently produced alongside EMD's two stroke engines, although mainly for export. Acceptance of the 265H was limited over reliability issues. The 265H, at , was the most powerful engine ever produced by EMD and the first four-stroke engine offered to the market by EMD or its ancestral companies since the Winton 201A introduced their breakthrough in two-stroke diesel power in 1934.\n\nIn 1999, Union Pacific placed the largest single order for diesel locomotives in North American railroad history when they ordered 1,000 units of the EMD SD70M. Union Pacific's fleet of SD70Ms has since been expanded by more than 450 additional units. In addition, Union Pacific also owns nearly 500 EMD SD70ACe's, six of which have been painted in \"Fallen Flags\" (acquired/merged railroads) commemorative liveries. All of these locomotives are 710G-powered.\n\nThe year 2004 saw CSX Transportation take delivery of the first SD70ACe units, which were advertised by EMD as more reliable, fuel efficient, and easier to maintain than predecessor model SD70MAC. The model meets the EPA Tier 2 emission requirements using the two-stroke 710 diesel engine.\n\nThe following year Norfolk Southern became the first carrier to receive the new SD70M-2 - successor to the SD70M. Like its sister roadswitcher, the SD70ACe, the SD70M-2 meets EPA Tier 2 requirements using the same engine. And like the \"ACe\", the \"M-2\" is certified to be in conformance with ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004.\n\nIn June 2004, \"The Wall Street Journal\" published an article indicating EMD was being put up for sale. On January 11, 2005, Reuters published a story indicating a sale to \"two private U.S. equity groups\" was likely to be announced \"this week\". Confirmation came the following day, with a press release issued by General Motors, stating it had agreed to sell EMD to a partnership led by Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC. The newly spun-off company was called Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc., thus retaining the famous \"EMD\" initials. The sale closed on April 4, 2005.\n\nOn June 1, 2010, Caterpillar Inc. announced it had agreed to buy Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. from Greenbriar, Berkshire \"et al.\" for $820 million. Caterpillar's wholly owned subsidiary, Progress Rail Services Corporation, completed the transaction on August 2, 2010, making Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Progress Rail Services Corporation. Although Caterpillar announced that John S. Hamilton would continue in his roles of president and CEO of EMD after the close of the transaction, Mr. Hamilton left EMD for unspecified reasons in late August 2010.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Tier-4 locomotive emissions regulations on new locomotives went into effect on January 1, 2015. As of that date EMD's 710-engined locomotives (e.g. SD70ACe's) could be built only for use outside the contiguous United States (i.e. Canada, Alaska, Mexico, and overseas). EMD had originally thought the 710 engine could be modified or \"tuned-up\" to meet Tier-4 standards, but it was not able to meet those requirements while maintaining optimum performance and reliability during rigorous \"real world conditions\" tests. Development of a Tier-4-compliant locomotive shifted from its original focus on the two-stroke 710 to the four-stroke 1010J engine, derived from the 265H engine.\n\nThe first (pre-production) locomotive using the 1010J engine, the SD70ACe-T4, using a (4,400 traction hp) 12 cylinder engine was unveiled in late 2015. Testing of the new locomotives began in the Spring of 2016. The first two units of a 65 unit order for the new locomotive were delivered to Union Pacific in December 2016.\n\nEMD continues to offer 710-powered locomotives for export as well as \"ECO\" upgrade packages for modernizing of older locomotives, which sustained their business during the hiatus of locomotive production for the domestic market.\n\nEMD currently maintains major facilities in McCook, Illinois, and Muncie, Indiana in the United States, Sete Lagoas, Brazil and San Luis Potosí, Mexico. The company operated a manufacturing facility in London, Ontario, Canada until its closure in 2012.\n\nSince its ground breaking in 1935, the La Grange facility has been the headquarters for EMD. In addition to the corporation's administrative offices, La Grange houses design engineering, emissions testing, rebuild operations, and manufacturing of major components, including prime mover engines, traction alternators, electrical cabinets, and turbochargers. The La Grange facility includes three main buildings, with over of office and manufacturing space. Ancillary buildings are used to provide maintenance and testing capabilities. EMD La Grange is ISO 9001:2008 Certified for Quality and ISO 14001 Certified for Environmental Management.\nA large part of the property's land has been sold off including the land where the original factory building stood. With the sale of the land, the large sign of \"Electro Motive Division\" that stood at the corner of 55th St. and East Ave. was removed but is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum.\n\nThe EMD London plant, in London, Ontario, Canada, opened in 1949 under EMD's Canadian subsidiary General Motors Diesel, Ltd., to produce locomotives during a time of rapidly rising demand. EMD London's Canadian location was useful for General Motors' when attempting to procure Canadian federal contracts and serve Canadian rail customers. Situated on a site, the EMD London facility included two main buildings and multiple ancillary buildings with over of office and manufacturing space, as well as a locomotive test track. Following reorganization under the Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada in 1969, the facility was at times used to produce a variety of products in the General Motors family, including transit buses (until 1979) and military vehicles. Following passage of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989, EMD London became the location where all of the construction, finishing, and testing of EMD locomotives in North America was performed. The facility also manufactured components such as locomotive underframes, traction motors, truck assemblies, and locomotive equipment racks. The rate of production was approximately one locomotive completed per day. EMD London was ISO 9001:2000 Certified for Quality and ISO 14001 Certified for Environmental Management. Following prolonged stagnation in EMD's North American market over the preceding years, the plant was closed in 2012 to reduce labor costs. Work was shifted to the new plant in Muncie, Ind. to take advantage of weak unions and lower pay in the U.S. market.\n\nIn January 2012, 450 Canadian Auto Workers union workers were locked out of the EMD London facility, after refusing to ratify EMD's proposed new contract which included a pay cut of 50% for some workers - labour costs at the Canadian plant were much greater than in some of the company's US plants. In February 2012 Progress Rail Services announced the closure of the plant; Caterpillar's actions were criticised in Canada; the company stated it would relocate production to other sites in North and South America, including the non-unionised plant in Muncie, Indiana. At the time of closure the plant employed approximately 775 people directly.\n\nOn April 14, 2010, Electro-Motive opened a facility in San Luis Potosí, Mexico for the maintenance, rebuild, and overhaul of traction motors and other electrical equipment.\n\nIn October 2010, Caterpillar Inc. announced it was investing US$50 million to acquire and to renovate an existing building for assembly of EMD brand locomotives and to build a locomotive test track on a site located in Muncie, Indiana. The Muncie facility allows EMD to supply locomotives to publicly funded passenger rail agencies that require their rail equipment be assembled in the United States exclusively. (see Buy America Act.)\n\nOn July 25, 2011, it was announced that production at the facility was planned to begin by the end of the year, with 125 workers having been hired and plans to add more. On October 28, the plant was officially opened, and the first locomotive produced at the plant, a Ferromex SD70ACe #4092, was rolled out.\n\nThe company also entered into subcontracting and licensing arrangements, both for whole locomotives, and diesel and electrical drivetrains (genset plus traction motors and control electronics)\n\nIn Europe licensees included Henschel (Germany), 1950s-80s which manufactured locomotives for export to African, South Asian, and Scandinavian counties as well as Austria; NOHAB (Sweden), 1950s-70s, and after NOHAB's closure Kalmar Verkstad (KVAB) (Sweden), 1980s. When the KVAB and Henschel factories were acquired by ABB Group in 1990 EMD-license manufacture ended.\n\nIn Belgium EMD-engined locomotives were manufactured by Société Anglo-Franco-Belge, and then by La Brugeoise et Nivelles in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nIn Spain MACOSA and its successors assembled and manufactured EMD locomotives including standard EMD export designs as well as variants for the domestic market, as of 2011 EMD-engined diesels are still manufactured in Spain as the Vossloh Euro series.\n\nĐuro Đaković of Croatia (Yugoslavia) also held a license from EMD and manufactured locomotives for the Yugoslav Railways.\n\nBy 2000 EMD had produced with its collaborators around 300 locomotives using EMD technology in Scandinavia, 500 in western Europe, and 400 in eastern Europe. Approximately 75% of EMD's European locomotives sold by 2000 were license built in Europe. The company also entered into a collaboration (early 2000s) with Lyudinovsky Locomotive Plant (Russia) (Людиновский тепловозостроительный завод), (now part of Sinara Group) creating a single-body eight axle 3MW (Bo'Bo')'(Bo'Bo')' diesel locomotive \"ТЭРА1\", powered by an EMD 710 16-cylinder engine. In the early 2010s the company began a collaboration with Croatian rolling stock company TŽV Gredelj.\n\nLocomotives were also assembled by \"General Motors Industria Argentina\", \"General Motors South African (Pty) Ltd\", and under license by \"Delta Motor Corporation\" (South Africa), \"Equipamentos Villares S.A.\" (Brazil), and Hyundai (Korea). Bombardier Transportation has also acted as subcontrator, manufacturing units at its plant in Sahagun, Mexico since 1998; with over one-thousand locomotives completed by 2007. The manufacturing agreement continued under Progress Rail ownership.\n\nIn Australia Clyde Engineering used EMD components in locally manufactured locomotives beginning in the 1950s. That company was absorbed into what is now Downer Rail (EDI rail division).\n\nIn India the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) has manufactured EMD designs since the late 1990s. In 2010 EMD announced its intention to establish its own manufacturing facility in India, potentially in Bihar through a PPP project with the state government, or in Uttar Pradesh. As of 2011 EMD's cooperative development association with Indian Railways is ongoing.\n\nIn China CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company has manufactured the EMD-designed units China Railways HXN3 (JT56ACe) since 2008.\n\nIn 2012 the EMD formed a joint venture with Barloworld, \"Electro-Motive Diesel Africa (Proprietary) Limited\", to supply locomotive and rail related products to the sub-saharan African market. In September 2012, EMD also signed a deal with Bombardier Transportation; Bombardier's factory in Savli, in India, would assemble EMD products for Asian customers.\n\nEMD also provides maintenance services, technical support, parts inventory, and sales and marketing services from many other locations spread throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Brazil, Egypt, and South Africa.\n\nEMD has produced the following series of engines:\n\nMost of the above locomotive engines were available, in modified form, for stationary and marine work. Marine engines differ from railroad and stationary engines mainly in the shape and depth of the engine's oil sump, which has been altered to accommodate the rolling and pitching motions encountered in marine applications.\n\nA new aluminum block lightweight compact engine was designed that ran at a higher rpm. These engines feature a vertical crankshaft and the cylinders were arranged in an X pattern of four cylinder banks in four cylinder rows. These were the 16-184 and 16-338 \"pancake\" engines. The 16-388 engine was from the base of the generator to the top of the air intake filter and wide. It is a mechanically injected two-stroke diesel engine that used a Roots blower. The 16-184A was installed in some subchasers of the during World War II. The two 16-184A diesel engines driving two shafts produced a faster subchaser that achieved 21 knots.\nThe EMD 16-338 developed at 1600 rpm. On the top was an air intake then four layers of four cylinders each. Each cylinder had a bore and a stroke. On the bottom of the crank shaft was an Elliot generator which developed 817 kW at a maximum of 710 volts DC. This proved problematic as the engine fluids ran down into the generator. The whole engine weighed just over eight tons. Being 4 feet wide it allowed for four engines in an engine room only long and also allowed design engineers to eliminate a submarine engine room. The and the research submarine used the troublesome EMD 16-338. On the \"Tang\"-class the Navy decided to replace the \"pancake\" engines with ten-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse opposed-piston 38D 8-1/8 diesels. The unreliability and lack of spares led to the decommissioning of USS \"Albacore\" in 1972 as further cannibalized parts became unavailable.\n\nThe following reporting marks are listed for rolling stock:\n\n\n\n"}

Freight barges being transported on the Arkansas River collided with a pier supporting the Interstate 40 road bridge crossing the river. The resulting failure of the supports caused a section of the bridge to collapse, killing 14 people and injuring another 11. The collision was determined to have resulted from a loss of consciousness on the part of the captain of the barges' towboat.\n\nJoe Dedmon, captain of the towboat \"Robert Y. Love\", was transporting barges on the Arkansas River. While traversing the Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, Dedmon experienced a syncopal episode and lost control of the tow. This, in turn, caused the barges he was towing to collide with a pier of the Interstate 40 bridge crossing the reservoir. A section of the bridge collapsed, plunging into the water. By the time traffic stopped and individuals became aware of the missing road, eight passenger vehicles and three semi-trucks had fallen into the river or on collapsed bridge pieces. Fourteen people died and eleven others were injured when the automobiles and tractor-trailers fell from the bridge. Survivors were aided by fishermen who were participating in a bass fishing tournament in the river near the bridge.\n\nThree people that had fallen into the river in their vehicles were able to get out and swim to shore. Whilst participating in a bass fishing tournament, fishermen on the water saw the disaster occurring and attempted to aid the victims and stop the cars and trucks they witnessed driving towards the bridge failure. One fisherman along the river shot a flare at a tractor-trailer driver in an attempt to get the truck to stop. Others threw ropes at individuals in vehicles to attempt to pull them from the water.\n\nThe two-time convicted felon William James Clark impersonated a U.S. Army captain at the disaster scene for two days. Clark's efforts included directing FBI agents and appropriating vehicles and equipment for the rescue effort, before fleeing the scene. Clark was later apprehended in Canada.\n\nAn estimated 20,000 vehicles per day were rerouted for about two months while crews rebuilt the bridge. Traffic resumed July 29, 2002—two months after the disaster. The reopening set a new national record for such a project, which would normally be expected to take six months.\n\nIt was reported that the towboat \"Robert Y. Love\" had problems with steering back in 1994, although Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Natalie Magnino stated that the 1994 problem was caused by debris that had jammed the rudder and was not the result of mechanical failure or pilot error.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board stated in 2004 that the collapse was due to Captain Dedmon's loss of consciousness, possibly due to an unforeseeable abnormal heart rhythm. Indiana University Professor of Medicine Douglas Zipes, agreed with this explanation and stated in a letter to Dedmon's attorney that it was likely that Dedmon had ventricular tachycardia, which caused him to black out. As a result of the accident the Safety Board recommended that the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center evaluate the utility and effectiveness of alerter systems within the wheelhouse of inland towing vessels. This was in addition to warning systems for motorists to stop in the case of a partial or total bridge collapse.\n\nIn May 2003, victims of the bridge collapse settled a lawsuit with the towboat company. The Mississippi-based company Magnolia Marine Transport Co. settled with the 14 deceased victims' families and those injured for an undisclosed amount. This is separate from the other suits against the company by the state of Oklahoma and by MBO Video, whose fiber optic cables were severed by the collapse.\n\nOn Memorial Day 2003, that year on May 26, a memorial statue was dedicated by Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry in Webbers Falls, Oklahoma.\n\nWebbers Falls marked the 15th Anniversary of the bridge collapse with a special ceremony at the Webbers Falls Historical City Park, with the monument in honor of those who were affected by the accident.\n\nThe town created a memorial statue in honor of the victims and the event, a 14-foot-tall bronze sculpture that incorporates pieces of the wreckage and is topped by a young girl reaching upwards to release a dove. The young girl represents the youngest victim, a 3-year-old girl. It was created by Shahla Rahimi-Reynolds, who was chosen by the Webbers Falls Committee to design the memorial, which also uses 14 granite plaques to memorialize each victim. The memorial was dedicated on May 26, 2003. The memorial cost the state almost $150,000.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1886 by Pierre Lorillard IV, its facilities now include an 18-hole golf course, lawn tennis, court tennis, racquets, squash, platform tennis, olympic-sized pool, and boating. The tuxedo was introduced by New York millionaire James Potter at the club's first Autumn ball in 1886, after a trip to England.\n\nThe original clubhouse, designed by Bruce Price, was built in 1886 and demolished in 1927. John Russell Pope's clubhouse was constructed on the original stone foundations the following year. The clubhouse is U-shaped, with stucco over wood frame, low hipped slate roof, stone embedded in stucco, leaded glass casements, and mullions forming crossettes in continuous fenestration. Located at the foot of Tuxedo Lake, it commands a view to the other end of lake and two ranges of wooded hills. A lawn extends between the club house and the lake.\n\nTo the northwest of the clubhouse is the court tennis and racquet house, also on West Lake Road. Designed by architects Warren and Wetmore, it was built between 1890 and 1900. Made of Bickley cement and supported by stone and brick arches in the basement, these courts became a model for future courts built in the United States. They have full galleries for spectators. The original glass roof with canvasses has been replaced with artificial light.\n\nThe golf course does not sit near the main clubhouse facility. It is roughly away just outside the gates of the private community known as Tuxedo Park where the main club, tennis club and pool are located. The golf course is actually the third golf course of the club, as the first became the Blair estate and the second was overtaken by the New York State Thruway, forcing the move of the course to the new location near the Eagle Valley section of Tuxedo. The course existing today was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr. It is an 18-hole championship course.\n\n"}
{"id": "1968575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968575", "title": "Principles of war", "text": "Principles of war\n\nPrinciples of war are rules and guidelines that represent truths in the practice of war and military operations. \n\nThe earliest known principles of war were documented by Sun Tzu, circa 500 BCE. Machiavelli published his \"General Rules\" in 1521 which were themselves modeled on Vegetius' \"Regulae bellorum generales\" (Epit. 3.26.1-33). Henri, Duke of Rohan established his \"Guides\" for war in 1644. Marquis de Silva presented his \"Principles\" for war in 1778. Henry Lloyd proffered his version of \"Rules\" for war in 1781 as well as his \"Axioms\" for war in 1781.Then in 1805, Antoine-Henri Jomini published his \"Maxims\" for War version 1, \"Didactic Resume\" and \"Maxims\" for War version 2. Carl von Clausewitz wrote his version in 1812 building on the work of earlier writers.\n\nThere are no universally agreed-upon principles of war. \n\nSince their first appearance in English of the military maxims of Napoleon in 1831, all English translations have relied upon the extremely incomplete French edition of General Burnod published in 1827. This has contributed to the erroneous belief that Napoléon Bonaparte had pioneered the \"Principles of War\". Napoléon was a keen follower of famous military generals of the past, who influenced his thoughts greatly. Albeit, \"The armies of today are based on the organization created by Napoleon [sic] for his Grand Army and it has been used ever since.\" (Weider, par. 12). Since the mid-19th century, due to the influence of the Prussian Army, they have become a guide for many military organizations to focus the thinking of military commanders and political leaders toward concepts and methods of successful prosecution of wars and smaller military operations. Although originally concerned with strategy, grand strategy and tactics, due to the changing nature of warfare and military technology, since the interwar period, the principles are largely applied to the strategic decision-making, and in some cases, to operational mobility of forces.\n\nThe principles of war identified by Carl von Clausewitz in his essay \"Principles of War\", and later enlarged in his book, \"On War\" have been influential on military thinking in the North Atlantic region.\n\nThe initial essay dealt with the tactics of combat, and suggested the following general principles:\n\nBased on the above, Clausewitz went on to suggest principles for tactics, the scale of combat that dominated European warfare at the time:\n\nClausewitz also included in the essay general principles of strategy by saying that Warfare has three main objects:\n\n\nStrategic Defense\n\nStrategic Offense\n\nApplied to specific forms of warfare, such as naval warfare, Julian Corbett argued that maritime strategy should play a significant role in the principles of war.\n\nVariations exist and differences are minor and semantic or reflect a cultural persuasion for a particular approach. A closer examination of the values and culture of origin reveals its war priorities.\n\nThe UK uses 10 principles of war, as taught to all officers of the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force:\n\nThe British Army’s principles of war were first published after the First World War and based on the work of the British general and military theorist, J. F. C. Fuller. The definition of each principle has been refined over the following decades and adopted throughout the British armed forces. The tenth principle, added later, was originally called Administration. The first principle has always been stated as pre-eminent and the second is usually considered more important than the remainder, which are not listed in any order of importance.\n\nThe 2011 edition of British Defence Doctrine (BDD) states and explains the principles with the following preface: “Principles of War guide commanders and their staffs in the planning and conduct of warfare. They are enduring, but not immutable, absolute or prescriptive, and provide an appropriate foundation for all military activity. The relative importance of each may vary according to context; their application requires judgement, common sense and intelligent interpretation. Commanders also need to take into account the legitimacy of their actions, based on the legal, moral, political, diplomatic and ethical propriety of the conduct of military forces, once committed.”\n\nThe ten principles as listed and defined in the 2011 edition, unchanged from the 2008 edition, of BDD (which also provides explanation) are:\n\nThese principles of war are commonly used by the armed forces of Commonwealth countries such as Australia.\n\nSoviet adoption of the principles of war is considered a part of Military Art, and is therefore a system of knowledge that is \nthe theory and practice of preparing and conducting military operations on the land, at sea, and in the air. As such it includes the following principles\n\nThe Soviet principles of military science, from \"Soviet AirLand Battle Tactics\" . Similar principles continue to be followed in CIS countries.\n\n\nThus it can be seen that in Military art, the Soviet and Western systems are similar, but place their emphasis in wildly differing places. Western systems allow more control and decision-making at lower levels of command, and with this empowerment comes a consistent emphasis. Offensive, mass, and maneuver principles for the western commander all place a sense of personal responsibility and authority to ensure these principles are followed by appropriate action. In contrast the Soviet system stresses preparedness, initiative, and obedience. This places more responsibility at the better prepared and informed centers of command, and provide more overall control of the battle.\n\nThe United States Armed Forces use the following nine principles of war:\n\nOfficers in the U.S. Military sometimes use the acronyms \"MOSS MOUSE\", \"MOOSE MUSS\", \"MOUSE MOSS\", \"MOM USE SOS\", and \"SUMO MOSES\" to remember the first letters of these nine principles.\n\nAccording to a United States Government document from 2010, the rule governing targeting in a non-international armed conflict is the international humanitarian law which is commonly known as the laws of war. The United States government stated in an undated Department of Justice White paper entitled \"Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qa’ida or An Associated Force\" that the four fundamental law-of-war principles governing the use of force are necessity, distinction, proportionality and humanity i.e. the avoidance of unnecessary suffering.(Page 8 of 16)\n\nThere is a debate within the American military establishment to adopt flexibility as the tenth principle of war. Frost argues that the concept of flexibility should be integrated with America's warfighting doctrine. Americans soundly retort that flexibility is a given that pervades all aspects of each principle.\n\nMany, however, hold that the principle of simplicity implicitly includes flexibility. One of the oldest dicta states that the simple plan is the flexible plan.\n\nIn 2007, \"Armed Forces Journal\" published a proposal by van Avery, \"12 New Principles of War\", to completely overhaul and expand the U.S. principles of war from nine to thirteen. The article was subsequently forwarded to the Joint Chiefs of Staff by Air Force Chief of Staff General Moseley and an effort to overhaul current U.S. doctrine was initiated using van Avery's framework.\n\nIn 2011, three new \"principles of joint operations\" were added to the cited nine principles of war. These principles are:\n\nTogether, these 12 concepts form the \"Principles of Joint Operations\".\n\nThe Canadian Armed Forces principles of war/military science are defined by the Royal Military College of Canada or Canadian Forces College website to focus on \"principles of command\", \"principles of war\", \"operational art and campaign planning\", and \"scientific principles\".\n\n\nThe French Army recognizes three principles to be applied to operation of land forces at the tactical level:\n\nAccording to French doctrine, new principles should be observed, primarily to protect the principle of \"Freedom of Action\":\n\nThe principles of war according to Israeli doctrine are:\n\nThe military principles of war of the People's Liberation Army were loosely based on those of the Soviet Union until the 1980s when a significant shift begun to be seen in a more regionally-aware, and geographically-specific strategic, operational and tactical thinking in all services. The PLA is currently influenced by three doctrinal schools which both conflict and complement each other: the People's war, the Regional war, and the Revolution in military affairs that led to substantial increase in the defence spending and rate of technological modernisation of the forces.\n\n\nIn recent years, 'Local war under high-tech conditions' has been promoted.\n\nThese principles can be applied to non-military uses when Unity of command is separated into coordination and reality, Economy of Force is redefined as use of resources, Mass is separated into renewable and non-renewable resources, and relationships are separated from unity of command.\n\nIn 1913 Harrington Emerson proposed 12 principles of efficiency, the first three of which could be related to principles of war: Clearly defined ideals — Objective, Common sense — Simplicity, Competent counsel — Unity of Command.\n\nThe some of the twelve non-military principles of efficiency have been formulated by Henry Ford at the turn of the 20th century, and are suggested to be: objective, coordination, action, reality, knowledge, locations (space and time),things, obtaining, using, protecting, and losing. Nine, ten, or twelve principles all provide a framework for efficient development of any objective\n\"Principles of War\" was also a book published in 1969 for the Japan Self-Defense Forces. It outlines the basic military principles and strategies by which the Japanese army was to operate. The book was used for most military exams in Japan. The book backs up all military principles with historical examples.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1968588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968588", "title": "Hypervelocity", "text": "Hypervelocity\n\nHypervelocity is very high velocity, approximately over 3,000 meters per second (6,700 mph, 11,000 km/h, 10,000 ft/s, or Mach 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to inertial stresses. Thus, metals and fluids behave alike under hypervelocity impact. Extreme hypervelocity results in vaporization of the impactor and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500 m/s (5,600 mph, 9,000 km/h, 8,200 ft/s, or Mach 7.3). Meteorite craters are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.\n\n\"Hypervelocity\" refers to velocities in the range from a few kilometers per second to some tens of kilometers per second. This is especially relevant in the field of space exploration and military use of space, where hypervelocity impacts (e.g. by space debris or an attacking projectile) can result in anything from minor component degradation to the complete destruction of a spacecraft or missile. The impactor, as well as the surface it hits, can undergo temporary liquefaction. The impact process can generate plasma discharges, which can interfere with spacecraft electronics.\n\nHypervelocity usually occurs during meteor showers and deep space reentries, as carried out during the Zond, Apollo and Luna programs. Given the intrinsic unpredictability of the timing and trajectories of meteors, space capsules are prime data gathering opportunities for the study of thermal protection materials at hypervelocity (in this context, hypervelocity is defined as greater than escape velocity). Given the rarity of such observation opportunities since the 1970s, the Genesis and Stardust Sample Return Capsule (SRC) reentries as well as the recent Hayabusa SRC reentry have spawned observation campaigns, most notably at NASA Ames Research Center.\n\nHypervelocity collisions can be studied by examining the results of naturally occurring collisions (between micrometeorites and spacecraft, or between meteorites and planetary bodies), or they may be performed in laboratories. Currently the primary tool for laboratory experiments is a light-gas gun, but some experiments have used linear motors to accelerate projectiles to hypervelocity. The properties of metals under hypervelocity have been integrated with weapons, such as explosively formed penetrator. The vaporization upon impact and liquefaction of surfaces allow metal projectiles formed under hypervelocity forces to penetrate vehicle armor better than conventional bullets.\n\nNASA studies the effects of simulated orbital debris at the White Sands Test Facility Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL). Objects smaller than a softball cannot be detected on radar. This has prompted spacecraft designers to develop shields to protect spacecraft from unavoidable collisions. At RHTL, micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts are simulated on spacecraft components and shields allowing designers to test threats posed by the growing orbital debris environment and evolve shield technology to stay one step ahead. At RHTL, four two-stage light-gas guns propel 0.05 mm to 22.2 mm diameter projectiles to velocities as fast as 8.5 km/s.\n\nAccording to the United States Army, \"hypervelocity\" can also refer to the muzzle velocity of a weapon system, with the exact definition dependent upon the weapon in question. When discussing small arms a muzzle velocity of 5,000 ft/s (1524 m/s) or greater is considered hypervelocity, while for tank cannons the muzzle velocity must meet or exceed 3,350 ft/s (1021.08 m/s) to be considered hypervelocity, and the threshold for artillery cannons is 3,500 ft/s (1066.8 m/s).\n\n"}

He started singing in choir groups at age five, including the San Francisco Boys Chorus. He attended Town School for Boys and San Francisco University High School, where he sang a lead role in the barbershop quartet his freshman year in \"The Music Man.\"\n\nSharon spent his college years in Boston, graduating from Tufts University with a degree in childhood studies and a degree from the New England Conservatory of Music with a focus on vocal jazz, third stream (now called \"contemporary improvisation\"), and music theory.\nIn college, he directed the collegiate a cappella group the Tufts Beelzebubs, transforming the group's sound to reflect modern rock, with intricate instrumental vocalizations and the integration of vocal percussion. The 1990–1991 Beelzebubs album \"Foster Street\" that he directed musically is credited with the creation of contemporary a cappella sound. Sharon had to audition three times before he was accepted, as he was seen as \"overzealous\" during a time when a cappella wasn't popular, a fact which was mentioned in the book \"Pitch Perfect\".. Benji in the Pitch Perfect movies is partially based on Deke Sharon. \n\nIt was during this time that he decided to make a career of contemporary a cappella\n\nSharon was the music director and arranger for the film \"Pitch Perfect\", as well as singing on several of the songs, where he was credited on screen as \"Male Voice #1\". He returned to make \"Pitch Perfect 2\", in which he has a brief cameo as the German judge and broadcaster. He helped involve several professional a cappella groups and singers with the film, including The Filharmonic, Penn Masala, and Pentatonix. Sharon also worked with the Green Bay Packers. He returned to music-direct, arrange, and vocally produce for \"Pitch Perfect 3\", and also arranged for the film, \"The Social Network\".\n\nIn December 2009, he acted as music director, arranger, coach, and consultant behind the scenes on America's first a cappella reality show competition, titled \"The Sing-Off\", and returned in 2010 as one of the show's producers.

WorldWide Access was the service name of the company, which was called Computing Engineers, Inc.\n\nWorldWide Access operated from 1993 until 1998, when it was acquired by Verio. At that time, WWA was located on the nineteenth floor of the Civic Opera Building at 20 N. Wacker Dr., where it had moved from the seventh floor six months earlier. Prior to its move to the Civic Opera Building, the firm's initial offices were located in Vernon Hills at the home of the Vronas and in Chicago at the home of Greg Gulik. The Vernon Hills office primarily handled customer service, sales, and new customer signup while the Chicago office was primarily responsible for technical support. \n\nComputing Engineers incorporated in 1993, with David Vrona and Greg Gulik as chief officers: Vrona was the President, while Gulik was Vice-President and head of IT operations. Additionally, Kathleen Vrona headed the sales and marketing efforts. The company's first Customer Service Manager was Michael Rubin, who was followed by Sean Ware.\n\nBy 1995, the company had approximately 10 employees and by 1997, it had about 25. After the acquisition by Verio in April, 1998, WWA/Verio Chicago grew to around 45 employees.\n\nWorldWide Access offered typical ISP accounts of the era, including terminal dial-up into BSD/OS UNIX shell systems, SLIP, and PPP; web hosting; UUCP and mail hosting; DNS registration and hosting; and leased-line circuits. The company also offered tech support for Macintosh computers, which was somewhat of a rarity at the time. WorldWide Access focused its sales efforts on signup up corporate clients but the company also served thousands of residential customers. The company focused heavily on customer service excellence and was considered to be one of the better ISP operations in the Chicago area. WWA was rumored to be one of the rare profitable ISPs that had been obtained by Verio during its acquisition binge of the late '90s.\n\nWWA used a take-out sashimi menu from a sushi restaurant to choose hostnames for its systems. At the time of the Verio acquisition, the menu had been nearly exhausted.\n\nWWA offered shell accounts from inception, starting out as the Gagme Public Access UNIX (pubnix) system originally operated by Greg Gulik. Gagme subscriber accounts were served up on a Linux machine named gagme, while the news server was named serveme, while a third machine (whyme) was more or less the personal server for Lily Moy, the future Mrs. Greg Gulik. WWA's shell accounts landed a user on his or her \"home\" server, one of four BSD/OS Intel machines: sake, sashimi, miso, and shoga. As late as 1998, WWA support knew of at least one customer still using a Commodore 64 machine to dial in.\n\nAdditionally, WWA offered the ubiquitous dialup SLIP/PPP service to customers. WWA was the first ISP in Chicago to offer dialup access as far out as Rockford, IL, and Milwaukee, WI, doing so by operating physical points of presence. One of the Chicago POPs was located at Marist High School.\n\nWWA was one of the first ISPs in the Chicago area to capitalize on virtual web hosting, by custom-coding virtual hosting into the NCSA httpd webserver before it was a core part of the product. This service was called MagicServer (another service mark of the corporation). The MagicServer version of httpd worked around some of the problems that plagued other implementations, such as the number of open file descriptors on the system, but had issues of its own which led to its eventual abandonment in favor of the standard built-in Apache virtual hosting.\n\nMagicServer hosts originally also ran on the BSD/OS shell servers, but were relocated to Sun SPARC hosts running Solaris in 1996. These were tako and anago, and later gari and soba were added.\n\nWWA provided DNS hosting to its customers on kani and tau. WWA was a long-time root nameserver for the *.chi.il.us domain.\n\nAdditionally, tau, which had been inherited from an ISP in Rockford IL (MISHA.NET) which WWA acquired, served as irc.Chicago.il.undernet.org. Tau was one of the few machines not to carry a sushi-related hostname.\n\nWWA operated one of several full Usenet feeds in the area, trading articles cooperatively with most local ISPs and other large providers such as the University of Illinois. \n\nWWA switched from local disk early on to a NetApp filer, which allowed WWA to run INN substantially more efficiently than previous. The main newsserver was kirin, and later hirame was added as a read-only newsserver.\n\nWorldWide Access later added Jeff Gerhardt as its Director of Business Development. Circa 1998, Gerhardt and Kathleen Vrona were later responsible for creating KidCam, which was Internet-accessible streaming video from local locations so parents could watch their kids from daycare or school remotely.\n\nThe bulk of the company's revenue was generated by the commercial accounts, but dialup accounts did comprise the majority part of WWA's actual end-users -- and dialup offered easily the most problems, as during that point in time, Ameritech and MFS (later SBC and AT&T, and WorldCom, respectively) were going through growing pains due to the exploding popularity of the Internet. Customers' dialup calls were often dropped or of such low line quality that little bandwidth could be sustained.\n\nBy the spring of 1996, competition among the ILEC and CLECs was getting rough, and the phone companies began to offer virtual points of presence: they would trunk in phone lines to a central location which offered a telephone prefix which was local to various other parts of the city, which allowed customers to dial into a phone line which was in their local (untimed) calling radius without forcing the ISPs to operate remote POPs, physical offices with networking gear and modems, in various places around the city just to be able to offer customers local dialin numbers.\n\nWorldWide Access was one of the first ISPs to choose MFS for this rather than using the ILEC, Ameritech's, competing product, the Ameritech Virtual Network (AVN). MFS's virtual phone circuits were plagued with problems for at least six weeks that spring, during which time customers had extreme reliability problems. The phrase 'My Fone Sux' was coined on the local wwa.* Usenet groups.\n\nWon't Work Always was another nickname which resulted from the MFS fiasco.\n\nOne weekend in May 1997, a Civic Opera tenant on the ninth floor had some problems with a large air-conditioning unit. On the fifth floor, the plumbing into which that chiller exhausted its water clogged, and the grey water began backing up. It began flooding out onto the fifth floor, but as it could not back up as quickly as the chiller was exhausting it, the backup climbed to the sixth floor and eventually began pouring out of a sink located in a utility closet in one of WWA's two neighboring seventh-floor suites.\n\nTwo WWA employees had been scheduled to perform routine off-hours maintenance on the DNS servers that Monday morning. By the time they arrived at the office around 2 o'clock AM, the hallway leading from the elevators to the office was noticeably humid, and the carpet nearest the office was actively squishing.\n\nThe planned maintenance was sidelined as the two staffers began to rescue soaking boxes of paper records and computers from the office (which was nicknamed \"the Holio\"). Several desktop computers, which had been stashed underneath desks to release more room for already-crowded workspaces, were still running in the water -- and at least one production server, a Windows NT web hosting machine, was several inches deep and still serving web pages. Meanwhile, the main WWA office, which housed the machine room, remained dry, as the plumbing to its kitchen was separate from the clogged drain line twenty yards to the east.\n\nWithin hours, the hallway to the main WWA office was completely lined on both sides by piles of soaking wet stuff. It took days to get most of the water removed from the suite. Over the next few weeks, a staged evacuation from the Holio was forced as the original rock maple flooring warped -- in places to heights of six- or eight-inch waves -- dislodging furniture, while mold proliferated in the carpeting and carpet padding, making the office uninhabitable.\n\nWWA subsequently relocated to a new, larger suite on the nineteenth floor.\n\nWorldWide Access was ultimately only one of several Chicago-based small Internet providers, which, in the end, were nearly all swallowed up by larger providers. WWA was the first to be sold, to Verio, in April 1998.\n\n\nOf the major local providers, only Ripco remained unsold, and it still operates independently as of 2017.\n"}

He practiced medicine in America's first gold rush town of Dahlonega, Georgia, for a number of years until he tired of the winters in the Appalachian Mountains. He heard good things about Texas from his brother, Gen. Alexander Carlton Bomar who was serving in the Mexican–American War, and decided to move his family there. \"En route\" to Texas with his wife Sarah Elizabeth Lumpkin Haynes of Cumming, Georgia, and two children, Bomar arrived in Atlanta on April 30, 1847, fell in love with the bustling young town and settled there, running a general merchandise business on Whitehall Street.\n\nThe young town soon thereafter received its first charter, and elections were held December 1847. Moses Formwalt was made mayor, Bomar its alderman, and five others were elected councilmen, all for one-year terms. The next year, Bomar was elected mayor at the age of 32, as a member of the Free and Rowdy Party. During his term he selected and purchased six acres (24,000 m²) at $75 per acre to serve as the new Oakland Cemetery.\n\nIn 1849, while serving as mayor, Bomar co-founded Atlanta's first successful newspaper, the \"Daily Intelligencer\".\n\nHe never practiced medicine regularly again.

{"id": "1968616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968616", "title": "Beguines and Beghards", "text": "Beguines and Beghards\n\nThe Beguines and the Beghards were Christian lay religious orders that were active in Northern Europe, particularly in the Low Countries, in the 13th–16th centuries. Their members lived in semi-monastic communities but did not take formal religious vows. That is, although they promised not to marry \"as long as they lived as Beguines,\" to quote one of the early Rules, they were free to leave at any time. Beguines were part of a larger spiritual revival movement of the 13th century that stressed imitation of Christ's life through voluntary poverty, care of the poor and sick, and religious devotion.\n\nThe term \"Beguine\" (; ) is of uncertain origin and may have been pejorative. Scholars no longer credit the theory expounded in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition (1911) that the name derived from Lambert le Bègue, a priest of Liège. Other theories, such as derivation from the name of St. Begga and from a purported, reconstructed Old Saxon word \"*beggen\", \"to beg\" or \"to pray\", have also been discredited. The origin of the movement's name will continue to be as uncertain as dates for the beginning of the movement itself.\n\nThere is likewise no evidence that Beguines ever formed part of the Cathar heretical groups. Encyclopedias, when they mention this latter explanation at all, tend to dismiss it.\n\nAmong Beguines who have become well-known representatives of the movement in contemporary literature are: Begijnhof (Amsterdam), Begijnhof (Breda), Begijnhof (Utrecht), Christina von Stommeln, Douceline of Digne, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete, Marie d'Oignies, and Mechthild of Magdeburg. Modern Beguines include Marcella Pattyn, and perhaps Dorothy Day.\n\nAt the start of the 12th century, some women in the Low Countries lived alone and devoted themselves to prayer and good works without taking vows. At first there were only a few, but in the course of the century, their numbers increased. Due to the structure of urban demographics and marriage patterns in the Low Countries, in the Middle Ages there were more women than men. These women lived in towns, where they attended to the poor. During the 13th century, some of them bought homes that neighbored each other. These small communities of women soon attracted the attention of secular and clerical authorities. Moved or inspired by the women's commitment to prayer, the sacraments, and charitable service in the world, local clergy sought to channel and deploy the women's spiritual fame in response to contemporary problems, especially the institutional church's war on heresy. Several clerics sought to promote these mulieres religiosae (or religious women) as saints after their deaths. Probably the most famous instance of this was the relationship between James of Vitry and Marie d'Oignies, who is sometimes referred to as the prototypical Beguine. Marie d'Oignies inspired James. She encouraged and improved his preaching and many of her miracles served to promote the sacramental program of Lateran IV. After Marie's death, James traveled to Rome on behalf of the \"religious women\" in the diocese of Liège, seeking papal permission for the women to live in common and incite one another to live good Christian lives.\n\nBeguines were not nuns, but they are sometimes conflated with nuns. Beguines took personal, informal vows of chastity. Animated by the ideals of the vita apostolica—the same ideals that led to the formation of the mendicant orders—Beguines pursued a life of contemplative prayer and active service in the world. As women, Beguines were forbidden to preach and teach, yet they actively exhorted their fellow Christians to live lives of penance, service, and prayer.\n\nBeguines were never recognized as an official, papally approved religious order. They did not follow an approved rule, they did not live in convents, and they did not give up their personal property. In fact, Beguines were free to abandon their religious vocation at any time since it was not enforced by any binding monastic vow. In many cases, the term \"Beguine\" referred to a woman who wore humble garb and stood apart as living a religious life above and beyond the practice of ordinary laypeople.\n\nIn cities such as Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Liege, local officials established formal communities for these women that became known as beguinages. Beguinages tended to be located near or within town centers and were often close to the rivers that provided water for their work in the cloth industry.\n\nWhile some women joined communities of like-minded lay religious women, adopting the label \"Beguine\" by virtue of entering a beguinage, many women lived alone or with one or two other like-minded women. Beguines engaged in a range of occupations to support themselves. Women in the Low Countries tended to work in the cities' lucrative wool industry. Parisian Beguines were important contributors to the city's burgeoning silk industry.\n\nBeguinages were not convents. There was no overarching structure such as a mother-house. Each beguinage adopted its own rule. The Bishop of Liège created a rule for Beguines in his diocese. However, every community was complete in itself and fixed its own order of living. Later, many adopted the rule of the Third Order of Saint Francis.\n\nBeguine communities varied in terms of the social status of their members; some of them only admitted ladies of high degree; others were reserved exclusively for persons in humble circumstances; others still welcomed women of every condition, and these were the most popular. Several, like the great beguinage of Ghent, had thousands of inhabitants. The Beguinage of Paris, founded before 1264, housed as many as 400 women. Douceline of Digne (c. 1215-1274) founded the Beguine movement in Marseille; her hagiography, which was composed by a member of her community, sheds light on the movement in general.\n\nThis semi-monastic institution was adapted to its age and spread rapidly throughout the land. Some Beguines became known as \"holy women\" (\"mulieres sanctae\"), and their devotions influenced religious life within the region. Beguine religious life was part of the mysticism of that age. There was a beguinage at Mechelen as early as 1207, at Brussels in 1245, at Leuven before 1232, at Antwerp in 1234, and at Bruges in 1244. By the close of the century, most communes in the Low Countries had a beguinage; several of the great cities had two or more.\n\nAs the 13th century progressed, some Beguines came under criticism as a result of their ambiguous social and legal status. As a conscious choice to live in the world but in a way that effectively surpassed (at least in piety) or stood out from most laypeople, Beguines attracted disapprobation as much as admiration. In some regions, the term Beguine itself denoted an ostentatiously, even obnoxiously religious woman; an image that quickly led to accusations of hypocrisy (consider the Beguine known as “Constrained Abstinence” in the \"Roman de la Rose\"). Some professed religious were offended by the assuming of \"religious\" status without the commitment to a rule, while the laity resented the implicit disapproval of marriage and other markers of secular life. The women's legal standing in relation to ecclesiastical and lay authorities was unclear. Beguines seemed to enjoy the best of both worlds: holding on to their property and living in the world as laypeople while claiming the privileges and protections of the professed religious.\n\nOn the other hand, admirers such as the secular cleric Robert de Sorbon (d. 1274) noted that Beguines exhibited far more devotion to God than even the cloistered, since they voluntarily pursued a religious life without vows and walls, surrounded by the world's temptations.\n\nThe power of the Beguine label is evident in the \"watershed\" moments of Beguine history, from its first appearance in the sermons of James of Vitry (the Beguine movement's earliest and perhaps most famous promoter), to its reference in the trial of the doomed mystic Marguerite Porete (who was burned at the stake in Paris on charges of heresy in 1310), to its centrality in the condemnation of lay religious women at the Council of Vienne in 1311–1312.\n\nSometime during the early to mid-1290s, Marguerite Porete wrote a mystical book known as \"The Mirror of Simple Souls\". Written in Old French, the book describes the annihilation of the soul, specifically its descent into a state of nothingness—of union with God without distinction. While clearly popular throughout the Middle Ages and beyond (perhaps dozens of copies circulated throughout late-medieval western Europe) the book provoked some controversy, likely because of statements such as \"a soul annihilated in the love of the creator could, and should, grant to nature all that it desires,\" which some took to mean that a soul can become one with God and that when in this state it can ignore moral law, as it had no need for the Church and its sacraments, or its code of virtues. This was not what Porete taught, since she explained that souls in such a state desired only good and would not be able to sin. Nevertheless, the book's teachings, for some, were too easily misconstrued, particularly by the unlearned.\n\nAt issue too was the way Porete disseminated her teachings, which was evocative of actions and behaviors some clerics were—at the time—finding increasingly problematic among lay religious women. Indeed, Porete was eventually tried by the Dominican inquisitor of France and burned at the stake as a relapsed heretic in 1310. In 1311—the year after Porete's death—ecclesiastical officials made several specific connections between Porete's ideas and deeds and the Beguine status in general at the Council of Vienne. One of the council's decrees, \"Cum de Quibusdam\", claimed that Beguines \"dispute and preach about the highest Trinity and the divine essence and introduce opinions contrary to the catholic faith concerning the articles of the faith and the sacraments of the church.\"\n\nAfter the Council of Vienne in 1312, the Beguines declined. By the 14th century, some communities were absorbed by monastic and mendicant orders. Many, however, survived the aftermath of the Vienne decrees.\n\nMost of these institutions were suppressed during the Reformation of the 16th century or during the stormy years of revolutions and social unrest of the French Revolution. A few béguinages persisted until the early 20th century in parts of Belgium, including those of Bruges, Lier, Mechelen, Leuven and Ghent, which last numbered nearly a thousand members in 1905.\nThe community of Begijnhof, Amsterdam, credited with having considerably influenced the development of what was the city's southern edge in the late Middle Ages, survived the Protestant Reformation staunchly Catholic. Their parish church was confiscated and given over to exiled English Puritans. The last Amsterdam Beguine died in 1971, but the Begijnhof remains one of the city's best-known landmarks.\n\nMarcella Pattyn, the last traditional Beguine, died on 14 April 2013 in Kortrijk at the age of 92. Born in the Belgian Congo in 1920, she was accepted into the Holy Corner of Elizabeth of Hungary at Sint-Amandsberg, Ghent, in 1941 and moved to the Béguinage of St Elisabeth at Kortrijk in 1960, where she became one of a community of nine.\n\nWriter Jean Hughes Raber, a student of medieval women's movements, posited a second wave of the Beguine movement, which occurred in the 17th century, when it was supported by Archbishop Mathias Hovius. His involvement included helping improve the Great Beguines at Mechelen. Raber says there was no clear end to the Second Movement. She suggests that Catholic lay movements, such as those of Dorothy Day in the United States, the Company of St. Ursula and communities of women initiated by Francisca Hernandez, can be seen as extensions of the Beguines into the 20th century.\n\nRaber suggests the Beguines' response to social and economic forces in the 12th century offer a model that can meet current conditions: economic uncertainty or worse, single women comprising a larger section of the population, and loss of wealth in the form of deflated values of housing. She cites a California-based group, the American Beguines, as an example of the revival of the Beguine Movement, with notable but not necessarily problematic differences. In recent decades, a new Beguine movement has arisen in Germany.\n\nRecently, the Beguines of Mercy were founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is a contemplative third order of educated Catholic women whose roots are in spiritual community. Their affiliations are good works, quiet contemplation, and living out their spiritual values.\n\nA widespread religious revival inspired several societies for men which were kindred to the Beguines. Of these, the Beghards were the most numerous and the most important.\n\nThe Beghards were all laymen and, like the Beguines, they were not bound by vows, the rule of life which they observed was not uniform, and the members of each community were subject only to their own local superiors. They held no private property; the brethren of each cloister had a common purse, dwelt together under one roof and ate at the same board. They were for the most part men of humble origin—like weavers, dyers, and fullers—who were closely connected with the city craft-guilds. For example, no man could be admitted to the Beghards' community at Brussels unless he were a member of the Weavers' Company. The Beghards were often men to whom fortune had not been kind—men who had outlived their friends, or whose family ties had been broken by some untoward event and who, by reason of failing health or advancing years, or perhaps on account of some accident, were unable to stand alone. If \"the medieval towns of the Netherlands found in the Beguinage a solution of their feminine question\", the growth of the Beghard communities provided a place for the worn-out working man.\n\nThe men had banded together in the first place to build up the inner man. While working out their own salvation, they remained mindful of their neighbors and, thanks to their connection with the craft-guilds, they influenced the religious life. They are credited with shaping the religious opinion of the cities and towns of the Netherlands for more than 200 years, especially for the peasant.\n\nReligious authorities believed the Beguines had heretical tendencies and sometimes tried to bring disciplinary measures against them. The Synods of Fritzlar (1259), Mainz (1261), and Eichstätt (1282) brought measures against them and they were forbidden as \"having no approbation\" by the Synod of Béziers (1299). They were condemned by the Council of Vienne (1312), but this sentence was mitigated by Pope John XXII (1321), who permitted the Beguines to resume their mode of life after reform.\n\nThe Beghards were more obstinate; during the 14th century, they were repeatedly condemned by the Holy See, the bishops (notably in Germany) and the Inquisition. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" acknowledges that men of faith and piety were found among the Beghards. In their behalf, Pope Gregory XI (1374–77) and Pope Boniface IX (1394) addressed Bulls to the bishops of Germany and the Netherlands. The doctrine of Quietism is believed to resemble the stance of these community members.\n\nBefore the close of the Middle Ages, Beghard communities were in decline. Their numbers diminished with the waning of the textile trade and, when that industry died, gradually dwindled away. The highest number of such medieval foundations in Flanders and Wallonia was 94, but in 1734 they had been reduced to just 34 and in 1856 to 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the essays he wrote while establishing the doctrine of American Transcendentalism. The lecture was read at the Masonic Temple in Boston, Massachusetts in January 1842.\n\nThe work begins by contrasting materialists and idealists. Emerson laments the absence of \"old idealists.\" He goes on to outline the fundamental beliefs and characteristics of the New England Transcendentalists. He discusses the nature of epistemology and the debate between Locke and Kant on Imperative forms and Transcendental forms, and discusses perception and reality in a blatantly Platonic sense. He says that solitude is a state of being that should be encouraged, for it allows humanity to achieve a higher level of alignment with nature and prevents the contamination that one encounters within a society.\n\nHenry David Thoreau embodied the majority of these characteristics, except for neglecting to take action against the government. Thoreau was a staunch abolitionist; his home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. He was actively subverting the government, but Emerson admitted that there was no perfect Transcendentalist. Emerson created a perfect, ideal archetype for the Transcendentalist, but also realized that it would be adapted to fit imperfect humans in an imperfect world.\n\n\n"}

It is also used for hereditary angioedema. It is taken either by mouth or injection into a vein.\nSide effects are rare. Some include changes in color vision, blood clots, and allergic reactions. Greater caution is recommended in people with kidney disease. Tranexamic acid appears to be safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Tranexamic acid is in the antifibrinolytic family of medications.\nTranexamic acid was first made in 1962 by Japanese researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Tranexamic acid is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 4.38 to US$4.89 for a course of treatment. In the United States, a course of treatment costs between 100 and US$200.\n\nTranexamic acid is frequently used following major trauma. Tranexamic acid is used to prevent and treat blood loss in a variety of situations, such as dental procedures for hemophiliacs, heavy menstrual bleeding, and surgeries with high risk of blood loss.\n\nTranexamic acid has been found to decrease the risk of death in people who have significant bleeding due to trauma. Its main benefit is if taken within the first three hours. It has been shown to reduce death due to any cause and death due to bleeding. Further studies are assessing the effect of tranexamic acid in isolated brain injury. Given within three hours of a head injury it also decreases the risk of death.\n\nTranexamic acid is used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. When taken by mouth it both safely and effectively treats regularly occurring heavy menstrual bleeding and improves quality of life. Another study demonstrated that the dose does not need to be adjusted in females who are between ages 12 and 16.\n\nTranexamic acid is used after delivery to reduce bleeding, often with oxytocin. Death due to postpartum bleeding was reduced in women receiving tranexamic acid.\n\n\nIn the United States, tranexamic acid is FDA approved for short-term use in people with severe bleeding disorders who are about to have dental surgery. Tranexamic acid is used for a short period of time before and after the surgery to prevent major blood loss and decrease the need for blood transfusions.\n\nTranexamic acid is used in dentistry in the form of a 5% mouth rinse after extractions or surgery in patients with prolonged bleeding time; e.g., from acquired or inherited disorders.\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding in people with blood cancers. However, there are several trials that are currently assessing this use of tranexamic acid. For people with inherited bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand's disease), tranexamic acid is often given. It has also been recommended for people with acquired bleeding disorders (e.g., directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) to treat serious bleeding.\n\nThe use of tranexamic acid, applied directly to the area that is bleeding or taken by mouth, appears useful to treat nose bleeding compared to packing the nose with cotton pledgets alone. It decreases the risk of rebleeding within 10 days.\n\n\n\nSide effects are rare. Some include changes in color vision, blood clots, and allergic reactions.\n\nBlood clots may include venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), anaphylaxis. These rare side effects were reported in post marketing experience and frequencies cannot be determined. Despite the mode of action, large studies of the use of tranexamic acid have not shown an increase in the risk of venous or arterial thrombosis.\n\n\nTranexamic acid is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine. It serves as an antifibrinolytic by reversibly binding four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, preventing fibrin degradation and preserving the framework of fibrin's matrix structure. Tranexamic acid has roughly eight times the antifibrinolytic activity of an older analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid. Tranexamic acid also directly inhibits the activity of plasmin with weak potency (IC = 87 mM), and it can block the active-site of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) with high specificity (Ki = 2 mM) among all the serine proteases.\n\nTranexamic acid was first synthesized in 1962 by Japanese researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. It has been included in the WHO list of essential medicines. TXA is inexpensive and treatment would be considered highly cost effective in high, middle and low income countries.\n\nTranexamic acid is marketed in the U.S. and Australia in tablet form as Lysteda and in Australia and Jordan it is marketed in an IV form and tablet form as Cyklokapron, in the UK as Cyclo-F and Femstrual, in Asia as Transcam, in Bangladesh as Tracid, in India as Pause, in Pakistan as Transamin, in South America as Espercil, in Japan as Nicolda, in France, Belgium and Romania as Exacyl and in Egypt as Kapron. In the Philippines, its capsule form is marketed as Hemostan and In Israel as Hexakapron.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tranexamic acid oral tablets (brand name Lysteda) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding on 13 November 2009.\n\nIn March 2011 the status of tranexamic acid for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding was changed in the UK, from PoM (Prescription only Medicines) to P (Pharmacy Medicines) and became available over the counter in UK pharmacies under the brand names of Cyklo-F and Femstrual, initially exclusively for Boots pharmacy, which has sparked some discussion about availability. (In parts of Europe it had then been available OTC for over a decade.) Regular liver function tests are recommended when using tranexamic acid over a long period of time.\n\n"}

The success of the ICCA produced a spin-off competition in 2005: the International Championship of High School A Cappella (ICHSA). Amanda Newman became owner of Varsity Vocals in 2008 and has since produced the events.\n\nThe 2006–2007 competition season was a focus of the book \"Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory\", which followed three groups vying to win the Championship. The ICCA Finals were featured in the 2015 reality TV series \"Sing It On\".\n\nThere are five or six quarterfinal events held in each of the eight American regions (Central, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Northeast, South, Southwest, West), while the United Kingdom region holds four. Generally, the top two college groups at each quarterfinal advance to the semifinals in their respective regions. The winner of each semifinal is invited to participate in finals, currently held at The Town Hall Theatre (the event has also been held in Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Carnegie Hall, PlayStation Theatre, and the Beacon Theatre), where they compete for coveted title of International Champion.\n\nEach group prepares a short 12 minute performance (usually three songs) that best show the group's strengths. Primary focus is on a group's musical performance, but presentation is important so it's not unusual to see choreography involved as well. Groups generally range in size from 8-20. A panel of three to five trained judges evaluates the group's performance.\n\nAccording to official Varsity Vocals documents, the aspects of vocal performance that are integral to a high-scoring ICCA performance include balance and blend, quality and inventiveness of arrangement, rhythmic accuracy, interpretation of song, intonation, solo interpretation, tone quality, dynamic precision, and diction. The first six of these concepts are graded on a 1-10 scale, while the last three are graded on a 1-5 scale. These numbers are added up, then added to the number for the next section, Visual Performance. The total possible score for this section is 75.\n\nVisual performance is, while not as highly weighted as vocal performance, still an integral aspect of any ICCA performance. The various aspects of visual performance include visual cohesiveness, effectiveness of presentation, energy/stage presence, appropriateness of movement, creativity of movement, transitioning/blocking, and professionalism. The first three categories are graded on a 1-10 scale, while the last four are graded on a 1-5 scale. The purpose of visual presentation is to present, not unlike a show choir, the emotiveness of a performance through body movement. While oftentimes a group may value Vocal Performance over Visual Performance, high marks and Semifinal award winning performances have relied equally on the strength of their movement with that of their sound.\n\nFinally, another crucial aspect of the performance grade comes in the form of a ranking box. If a judge decides that your group merits 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place in the overall competition, they circle one of these choices, which comes to correspond with an additive point value. So, if a judge decides you are the 1st place group, another 30 points are added to that individual judge’s overall score. If they decide you are 2nd, you receive an additional 20 points, and if they decide you are 3rd, you receive an additional 10 points. These go towards the eventual rankings at the end of the night’s performance, when the judges announce the first place winner, the runner up, and the second runner up.\n\nOccasionally the event has caught the attention of national media. The greatest television exposure was three successive performances on The Today Show in 2001, culminating with a Monday morning performance by the champions, the University of Michigan Compulsive Lyres. The following year, competitors the Skidmore Dynamics were the subject of a \"New York Times\" article a few days before they took the stage at Lincoln Center.\n\nFollowing their first ICCA win, and appearance on The Today Show in 2008, the SoCal VoCals were featured in an article in Newsweek Magazine.\n\nVarious ensembles compete for the ICCA national title in the comedy \"Pitch Perfect\", while a fictionalized World Championship competition is portrayed in the 2015 sequel. \"Pitch Perfect 2\" was released on December 22, 2017.\n\n12.

The film stars Peter Strauss, Molly Ringwald, Ernie Hudson, Andrea Marcovicci and Michael Ironside. The film's executive producer was Ivan Reitman, and it was directed by Lamont Johnson. The film's music score composed by Elmer Bernstein. When the film was originally released in theaters it was shown in a polarized, over/under 3-D format. The film became part of the 3-D film revival craze of the early 1980s, being widely released after \"Comin' at Ya!\" (1981). The film is about a bounty hunter who goes on a mission to rescue three women stranded on a brutal planet and meets a vagrant teenage girl along the way.\n\nSet in the early 22nd century, the film opens with the destruction of a space cruise liner by a bolt of nebular lightning. The only apparent survivors are three beautiful women – Nova, Reena, and Meagan – who get away in an escape pod and land on the nearest habitable planet. There, they are quickly accosted by the hostile natives and taken aboard a sail-driven vehicle resembling a pirate ship on rails.\n\nIn space, an alert goes out for the safe return of the women with a reward of 3,000 \"mega-credits\". A small-time salvage operator named Wolff intercepts the message and heads to the planet. Joining him is his female engineer Chalmers, who learns the planet – called Terra XI – is a failed colony that fell victim to a deadly plague and civil warfare. Wolff risks the dangers believing the reward will solve his debt problems.\n\nAfter landing on the barren world, Wolff and Chalmers set out in a 4-wheel drive vehicle called the \"Scrambler\". Soon, they join a battle in progress between a group of marauders (called the \"Zoners\") and a band of nomads (the \"Scavs\"). The Zoners take the women before Wolff can stop them and fly away on jet-powered hang-gliders. Wolff learns from the Scavs that the women were taken into \"The Zone\" which is ruled by \"Overdog\" – their sworn enemy. Returning to the Scrambler, Wolff finds Chalmers – who is really a Gynoid – has been killed. Wolff continues on alone, but soon catches a teenage Scav named Niki trying to steal his Scrambler. She convinces Wolff that he needs a tracker if he is to survive The Zone and Wolff reluctantly takes her lead.\n\nIn the meantime, the three women are taken before \"The Chemist\", the chief henchman of Overdog – a hideous cyborg with giant metal claws for hands – who administers pacifying drugs to the girls and prepares them for Overdog's pleasure.\n\nElsewhere, Wolff and Niki make camp, but soon come under attack by a strange plow-like vehicle. Wolff manages to disable the machine and learns the driver is a former military acquaintance of his – a soldier named Washington, who reveals he too has come to rescue the women. His only problem is that he crashed his ship and has no way off of the world they're on. Wolff refuses to help his rival and leaves him to fend for himself.\n\nStill led by Niki, Wolff gets into more predicaments – from being attacked by mutated humanoids, to strange amazon-like women and a water dragon (which the amazon-like women fear). He even loses his trusty Scrambler and is forced to continue on foot. Eventually, they are found by Washington, and Wolff finds the situation reversed as he now begs his rival for help. They agree to a 50/50 split of the reward.\n\nWolff and Washington team up and sneak into Overdog's fortress where they find the Zoners entertained by captured prisoners forced to run through a deadly maze of lethal obstacles, hazards and traps. Wolff spots the women being held in a cage and forms a rescue plan, but a bored Niki (who was left out of the rescue for her safety) decides to snoop around. She is captured and sent into the maze. Wolff spots Niki in the maze and tries to rescue her, but she uses her prowess to reach the end where Overdog congratulates her and drags her back to his lair. There, she is hooked to a machine that slowly drains her life energy. The energy in turn recharges Overdog. Wolff comes to the rescue and jabs a sparking power cable into one of Overdog's claws. The power feedback fries Overdog and thus causes cascading blowouts throughout the entire fortress. As the fortress explodes around them, Wolff and Niki run for cover and are rescued by the timely arrival of Washington, who is driving the plow machine with Nova, Reena and Meagan driving another commandeered vehicle. They all race out of the fortress in the nick of time as it explodes behind them.\n\nAs the complex explodes, the three heroes, and the three rescued women, manage to get away. In the ending, Wolff invites Niki to stay with him and she agrees since they made good partners.\n\n\nParts of the film were shot in Kane Creek, Bull Canyon, Colorado River, Potash, Lower Shafer Trail, Potash Settling Ponds, Grey Hills, U.S. Highway 91, and the area south of Canyonlands Airport.\n\nThe film's advertising emphasized the 3D aspects. Columbia released \"Spacehunter\" on May 20, 1983, timed to be a week before \"Return of the Jedi\". It grossed $16.5 million at the United States box office. While the film went mostly ignored at the U.S. box office, it did find some success on home video becoming the 10th best selling videocassette of 1983\n\n\"Variety\" called it \"a muddled science fiction tale\" whose editing prevents audiences from enjoying the well-shot action scenes. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film does more with its 3D than its contemporaries but is too crowded with derivative ideas to be memorable. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 25% and average rating of 3.24/10 based on 12 reviews.\n\nC.J. Henderson reviewed \"Spacehunter\" in \"Space Gamer\" No. 65. Henderson commented that \"Watch for this one when it is finally released to cable, or to the video stores. This is one of those movies one gets more from in the living-room than in the theatre.\"\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Espa Julio Trigo. He grew up with professional baseball player Yunel Escobar.\n\nPeña left Cuba for the United States in 1999.\n\nPeña was called up to the big leagues early in the 2005 season because of an injury to Eddie Pérez. He made his debut on May 23, 2005 in an 8-6 home win over the New York Mets. Starting at catcher and batting seventh, Peña went 1-4 and scored a run. His first hit was a second-inning single off Kazuhisa Ishii. At the big-league level for the year, in 18 games he batted .179 with four runs batted in.\nFor the next three seasons, 2006-2008, he saw part-time action for the Braves, playing in 23, 16 and 14 games, respectively, and totaling 22 hits including two home runs.

However, he was designated for assignment the next day, and did not appear in a game. He was promoted from the Royals' AAA affiliate on May 31, 2009. He then saw his most big-league playing time to date, appearing in 64 games and batting .273 with six home runs and 18 RBIs.\n\nIn 2010, he earned a spot in the big-league roster during spring training and spent the 2010 season backing up Jason Kendall. He looked to earn a spot as a starter for the future in the last month of the season, as Kendall was out due to injury. Peña received the bulk of the playing time behind the plate in September.

He played in 71 games in 2013, and posted the best batting average of his career at .297 to go with four home runs and 22 RBIs.\n\nPeña and the Cincinnati Reds agreed to terms on a two-year contract, covering the 2014 and 2015 seasons. In 2014 Peña shared playing time with catcher Devin Mesoraco and played first base while first baseman Joey Votto was injured. By the 2014 all-star break, Peña was on his way to a career year, playing in 65 games and batting .250 with three home runs, 17 RBIs and an already career-best 12 doubles. On November 2, 2015, Peña became a free agent.\n\nOn November 30, 2015, Peña agreed to a two-year, $5 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals to be the primary backup to Yadier Molina. In mid-December 2015, Peña accompanied an expedition to Cuba composed of former Cardinals including Joe Torre and Jon Jay, and other MLB officials and players. It was MLB's first visit there since 1999, and one anticipated as an important step to help normalize relations with the United States that had begun to ease earlier in the year. He began the season on the DL after surgery to remove loose cartilage in his left knee, which he attributed to slipping on the dugout steps in spring training. On July 5, 2016, Peña announced that he was planning to join the Army Reserve after the 2016 season. Later that day though, he was informed that he was unable to enlist because such an action would violate the terms of his contract. Peña chose to become an ambassador for the troops instead. On November 21, 2016, the Cardinals designated Peña for assignment.\n\nPeña signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training on February 7, 2017. He elected free agency on November 6, 2017.\n\nOn January 9, 2018, the Detroit Tigers signed Peña to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training. He was released on June 11, 2018. Peña announced his retirement from professional baseball on June 18, 2018.\n\nPeña served as the manager of the Tigers' Gulf Coast League West team, who won the Gulf Coast League Championship in 2018. During the 2019 season, he served as manager of the short season-A Connecticut Tigers. On November 12, 2019, he was named manager of the West Michigan Whitecaps.\n\n"}

CASA was founded in 1991 by Deke Sharon in San Francisco just after graduation. In his Tufts University dorm room during his senior year, Sharon published a newsletter, The \"C.A.N.\" (The Collegiate A Cappella Newsletter for the first 2 issues, then The Contemporary A Cappella Newsletter), mailed to all known collegiate a cappella groups by merging \"The List,\" founded in 1988 & distributed by Rex Solomon, with the database maintained by his college a cappella group the Beelzebubs. The organization boasts over 6,000 current members, and serves as a resource for media and scholarly work in the area of contemporary a cappella.\n\nSince 1992, the annual Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (aka the \"CARAs\") recognize the best recorded a cappella and aim to support this burgeoning culture of instrumentless enthusiasts. Every a cappella album produced each year is automatically considered in this celebration of the best a cappella recorded around the planet.\n\nThe CARA mission reflects that of its parent organization, the Contemporary A Cappella Society (CASA) : an aim to reward artists that create outstanding work and to promote innovation, creativity, and continued growth of the a cappella modality. Furthermore, the awards aim to foster the a cappella community by having its best and brightest participate in the CARA nomination and judging process. Finally, CASA uses the application process as a means to provide resources to charitable programs such as Tunes to Teens (free a cappella recordings for students).\n\nThe \"A Cappella Community Awards\" (aka the \"ACAs\") are voted on annually by registered users of CASA.org to allow fans the chance to award their favorite a cappella groups. Often called the \"People's Choice Awards of the A Cappella community\", the ACAs aim to further award excellent groups and individuals in the a cappella community, including non-American groups, by giving fans a venue to reward their favorite groups.\n\nCASA produces weekend-long educational festivals open to the general public several times a year around the US, including the Los Angeles A Cappella Festival (\"LAAF\") in February, the Boston A Cappella Festival (\"BOSS\") in April, and the Southern A Cappella Festival (\"SoJam\"). In the past festivals have been held in San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.\n\nCASAcademy is a comprehensive web portal where CASA members can come to learn more about a cappella, hear samples of great music, view videos of great performances, read about forming and managing groups, and read about all a cappella-related topics (vocal health, etc.).\n\nThe CASA Acapedia is a huge database of a cappella groups, solo artists, beatboxers, studios, producers and more. The Acapedia is free and editable by any registered CASA member. It not only has information on existing groups, but also includes the profiles for groups that no longer exist. The database is set up like a Wiki, in which any user can add/modify information. All changes are tracked and can be un-done in the event of error or vandalism. The Acapedia currently features over 2400 profiles.\n\nEach Acapedia profile is designed to include group information such as school or affiliation, current roster of members, concert listings, history, recording information, and tour dates.\n\nThe Ambassador Program is aimed to unite singers and groups from all over the country and world via an organized networking system. CASA Ambassadors are individuals responsible for being involved in their own a cappella communities- gathering information about groups, events, auditions, a cappella friendly clubs, singers, technology, opportunities and anything else that touches on a cappella. They upload that information to CASA.org via the Acapedia so it can be shared with the entire community.\n\nAmbassadors also keep abreast of a cappella happenings globally via CASA.org, and share that information with their respective communities while encouraging them to become CASA members, to sing in Contemporary A Cappella League groups, to attend CASA festivals, and to support the vocal arts.\n\nAmbassadors serve a one-year volunteer term, and are offered a number of incentives which have included free memberships to CASA.org, free copies of CASA-sponsored compilation albums and free tickets to CASA-sponsored festivals such as SoJam.\n\nTunes To Teens (TTT) is designed to put a cappella CDs into the hands of developing singers. Chorus by chorus, TTT sends junior high and high school students a cappella CDs donated by a variety of sources. The program's goal is to spark interest in a cappella music in up-and-coming singers, and to serve as a touchstone for directors to teach their students the basics of music theory. Since 2003, over 2000 students in 23 US states and Canada have received CDs from TTT.\n\nA Cappella Radio International was aired on over 50 stations worldwide from 1996 to 2004.\n\nCASA has been establishing contemporary a cappella choruses around the United States, from the SF Bay Area to Maryland.\n\n"}

One of these is the Undesirable Publications Act (Chapter 338) .\n\nAmongst the various definitions of 'publication' are 'any picture or drawing, whether made by computer-graphics or otherwise howsoever' and 'any photograph, photographic negative, photographic plate or photographic slide'. A publication is deemed 'obscene' if 'its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.'\nA publication is 'objectionable' if 'in the opinion of any controller, it describes, depicts, expresses or otherwise deals with - (a) matters such as sex, horror, crime, cruelty, violence or the consumption of drugs or other intoxicating substances in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.' Also if it '(ii) exploits the nudity of persons or children or both' and contravenes '(d) the standards of morality, decency and propriety that are generally accepted by reasonable members of the community.'\n\nThe offences section states, 'Any person who without reasonable excuse has in his possession any prohibited publication or any extract therefrom shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction for a first offence to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, and for a subsequent offence to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years.'\n\nDespite these caveats, local gay artists have, since the 1980s, been pushing at the boundaries to enable the general public to develop an appreciation for their emotional expression crafted through art.\n\nThe first openly gay artist, Ted, held a pioneering exhibition of homo-erotic art entitled \"Out of the Closet\" in the early 1990s .\n\nFrom February 20–28, 1993, Tan Peng and American artist, John C. Goss, held Singapore's first openly gay-themed art exhibition entitled Flowing Forest, Burning Hearts, at The Substation public gallery. This two-man show was Tan's third exhibition of homoerotic work, but the first in which he came out publicly in the press as a gay man. His large pastel drawings tackled issues of importance to local gays: oppression, pressure to marry, invisibility, repressive religions, safer sex and HIV caregiving, and police entrapment. Some of his works from this watershed exhibition are archived here.\n\nIn 2000, Straitsborn Chinese or Peranakan artist, Martin Loh, discreetly displayed a series of nude male paintings at the upper levels of the John Erdos Gallery as part of his solo exhibition of largely Peranakan-themed artworks entitled 'Heightened Senses' .\n\nMartin Loh's 'Men in the Raw' exhibition in January 2003 was the first in Singapore to showcase homoerotic art. The exhibition showcased pieces such as 'Forbidden Kiss' (1999, pastel on paper), 'The Nibble' (2001, mixed media on napkin) and 'Size Matters' (2000, mixed media on paper). The versatile artist also experimented with a diversity of media, displaying full-figure acrylic portraits on canvas, riotously colourful male pairings in mixed media on paper and sensual traces of male outlines captured with felt pen or brush .\n\nIn 2003, gay photographer Jason Wee held a joint exhibition, together with straight female artist Parvathi Nayar, entitled 'Celestial Encounters' at the Utterly Art exhibition space in South Bridge Road , .\nHe presented an intelligent inquiry into identity and its distortion as a consequence of misplaced notions of fashion, integration and ethnicity. Using the Chinese zodiac as a case in point, he proposed that people follow astrological predictions as a predestined or predetermined mould for themselves, rather than chart the progress of their own lives empirically. The visual devices that Wee enlisted included 1) naked male models to represent man's essential selves, 2) tattoos, gestures and contortions to represent the adoption of foreign identities and 3) digital layering of ikat images and text as garments to signify the complexity of the final self that man presents to the world.\n\nIn August 2004, 3 LGBT art exhibitions were held at local galleries: 'Red + White = Pink' at Utterly Art), 'Erotica' at Art Seasons and 'Private Edge' at B2G Gallery. These featured the oeuvres of gay artists both from Singapore and the around the region. The participating artists included Genevieve Chua, Tania De Rozario, Jane Porter, Aidah Dolrahim, Teng Nee Cheong, Martin Loh, Desmond Sim, Ernest Chan Tuck Yew, Justin Lee, Michael Lee Hong Hwee, Han Kiang Siew, Zulharli Adnan, Brian Gothong Tan, Lim Jit Hwang, Sazeli Jalal, Jason Wee, Daniel Poh, Wong Hong Weng, Nicholas Chai and Aiman Hakim.\n\nIn May 2005, artist-photographer Jason Wee, now based in New York City, held a local installation art exhibition at The Substation gallery entitled 'Bao Bei' which examined the ways through which identity is reconstructed through online personal ads. In particular, gay photographic self-portraits found online were scrutinised for their codes and tropes, and how these tropes may reveal the effects and consequences of larger political forces. One of the ground-breaking features of this exhibition was the display of nude male photographs with erections pixelated, but still discernible if one looked closely enough. He also recreated as photographs cultural works that were previously censored, such as Justin Lee's flag painting, Royston Tan's 15 and Ryan McGinley liplocked with his boyfriend in i-D magazine, which was systemically sliced from every issue sold and repackaged by Singapore's Media Development Authority (MDA), the guardian of public morality in the media.\n\nAt the end of May 2005, in an amendment to the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act (Chapter 257) , nine categories of arts entertainment events including 'displays or exhibitions of art objects or paintings' were exempted from having to apply for a Public Entertainment Licence from the Media Development Authority (MDA). The landmark decision was made after consultation with MDA's arts advisory groups, following the recommendations of the 2003 Censorship Review Committee appointed by the Government arts watchdog of the time, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MITA) to exempt more 'innocuous' arts entertainment from licensing. Jason Wee's exhibition (see above) featuring pixelated erect male genitalia was mentioned in the press release and was finally deemed to be 'innocuous' by the Government.\n\nIn August 2005, gay activists, bolstered by broad-based grassroots support organised Singapore's first month-long gay pride celebration called IndigNation. The latter moniker was a clever play of words representing the gay community's displeasure at the unexpected official ban of the annual Nation mega-parties which had been approved and held without incident 4 years in a row prior to 2005 .\n\nAn exhibition by openly gay artist Martin Loh was opened in July 2005 at the Utterly Art exhibition space in South Bridge Road. It was entitled Cerita Budak-Budak, meaning \"Children's Stories\" in Peranakan Malay. It was Loh's maiden foray into the genre of book illustrations. His work - colourful, naive fantasies - was used to illustrate the book Malaysian Children's Favourite Stories .\n\nOn Thursday, 4 August 2005, Singapore's first widely publicised and government-sanctioned gay poetry reading session entitled Contra/Diction– A Night With Gay Poets was held, also at Utterly Art. The gay community felt that it was time the mainstream public recognised that LGBT people made significant contributions to life and society in Singapore. Much of the local arts scene would come to a standstill if not for these gay men and women. And yet many of Singapore's most talented performers had to remain closeted or ambiguous for fear of having their livelihoods threatened. As a sign of the changing times, an invitation was put out for a night of poetry where some of Singapore's openly gay and upcoming poets read the beautiful words they had penned, birthed from within the ecstatic, the agonies and even the mundanities of their lives and discussed how their sexual orientation impacted their works as poets. Wine and snacks were served. The Media Development Authority were very helpful in facilitating the procurement of an Arts Entertainment Licence (R18) for this event within 24 hours. The event was given coverage by \"Today\" newspaper .\n\nThe second art exhibition of IndigNation was held from 10 August to 16 August 2005 at \"The Box\". It was entitled Solitary Desire and featured pieces by Ong Jenn Long and Steve Chua, both young, emerging talents .\n\nOng's works gave a sense of mystery, provoking the audience’s imagination through the clever execution of light and shadows. The seductive visual style of his works tempted the audience to examine the subject closer and left it entirely to their interpretation. Chua's graphic design background was significant in his pieces as they reflected modern day consumerism and the effect of commercials. His intention was, in his own words, to \"focus and deal with the notion of desire / image / identity\", and the effect of consumerism upon the self.\n"}

The array of robotic telescopes aims to survey the entire sky, simultaneously monitoring many thousands of stars at an apparent visual magnitude from about 7 to 13.\n\nWASP is the detection program composed of the Isaac Newton Group, IAC and six universities from the United Kingdom. The two continuously operating, robotic observatories cover the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively. SuperWASP-North is at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the mountain of that name which dominates La Palma in the Canary Islands. WASP-South is at the South African Astronomical Observatory, Sutherland in the arid Roggeveld Mountains of South Africa. These use eight wide-angle cameras that simultaneously monitor the sky for planetary transit events and allow the monitoring of millions of stars simultaneously, enabling the detection of rare transit events.\n\nInstruments used for follow-up characterization employing doppler spectroscopy to determine the exoplanet's mass include the HARPS spectrograph of ESO's 3.6-metre telescope as well as the Swiss Euler Telescope, both located at La Silla Observatory, Chile. WASP's design has also been adopted by the Next-Generation Transit Survey. As of 2016, the \"Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia\" data base contains a total of 2,107 extrasolar planets of which 118 were discoveries by WASP.\n\nWASP consists of two robotic observatories; SuperWASP-North at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma in the Canaries and WASP-South at the South African Astronomical Observatory, South Africa. Each observatory consists of an array of eight Canon 200 mm f1.8 lenses backed by high quality 2048 x 2048 science grade CCDs, the model used is the iKon-L manufactured by Andor Technology. The telescopes are mounted on an equatorial telescope mount built by Optical Mechanics, Inc. The large field of view of the Canon lenses gives each observatory a massive sky coverage of 490 square degrees per pointing.\n\nThe observatories continuously monitor the sky, taking a set of images approximately once per minute, gathering up to 100 gigabytes of data per night. By using the transit method, data collected from WASP can be used to measure the brightness of each star in each image, and small dips in brightness caused by large planets passing in front of their parent stars can be searched for.\n\nOne of the main purpose of WASP was to revolutionize the understanding of planet formation, paving the way for future space missions searching for 'Earth'-like worlds.\n\nWASP is operated by a consortium of academic institutions which include:\n\nOn 26 September 2006, the team reported the discovery of two extrasolar planets: WASP-1b (orbiting at 0.038 AU (6 million km) from star once every 2.5 days) and WASP-2b (orbiting three-quarters that radius once every 2 days).\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the team reported the discovery of three extrasolar planets: WASP-3b, WASP-4b and WASP-5b. All three planets are similar to Jovian mass and are so close to their respective stars that their orbital periods are all less than two days. These are among the shortest orbital periods discovered. The surface temperatures of the planets should be more than 2000 degrees Celsius, owing to their short distances from their respective stars. The WASP-4b and WASP-5b are the first planets discovered by the cameras and researchers in South Africa. WASP-3b is the third planet discovered by the equivalent in La Palma.\n\nIn August 2009, the discovery of WASP-17b was announced, believed to be the first planet ever discovered to orbit in the opposite direction to the spin of its star, WASP-17.\n\nThe discovery of the J1407 system and its unusual eclipses were first reported by a team led by University of Rochester astronomer Eric Mamajek in 2012. The existence and parameters of the ring system around the substellar companion J1407b were deduced from the observation of a very long and complex eclipse of the previously anonymous star J1407 during a 56-day period during April and May 2007. The low-mass companion J1407b has been referred to as a \"Saturn on steroids\" or “Super Saturn” due to its massive system of circumplanetary rings with a radius of approximately 90 million km (0.6 AU). The orbital period of the ringed companion J1407b is estimated to be around a decade (constrained to 3.5 to 13.8 years), and its most probable mass is approximately 13 to 26 Jupiter masses, but with considerable uncertainty. The ringed body can be ruled out as being a star with mass of over 80 Jupiter masses at greater than 99% confidence. The ring system has an estimated mass similar to that of the Earth. A gap in the ring system at about 61 million km (0.4 AU) from its centre is considered to be indirect evidence of the existence of an exomoon with mass up to 0.8 Earth masses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ease combines the process constructs of communicating sequential processes (CSP) with logically shared data structures called \"contexts\". Contexts are parallel data types that are constructed by processes and provide a way for processes to interact.\n\nThe language includes two process constructors.\n\nA \"cooperation\" includes an explicit barrier synchronization and is written:\n\nIf one process finishes before the other, then it will wait until the other processes are finished.\n\nA \"subordination\" creates a process that shares the \"contexts\" that are in scope when created and finishes when complete (it does not wait for other processes) and is written:\n\nSubordinate processes stop if they attempt to interact with a \"context\" that has completed because the parent process has stopped. This enables speculative processes to be created that will finish if their result is not needed.\n\nPowerful \"replication\" syntax allows multiple processes to be created. For example,\n\ncreates \"n\" synchronized processes each with a local constant \"i\".\n\nProcesses cannot share \"local\" variables and cooperate in the construction of shared \"contexts.\" Certain context types, called \"resources\", ensure call-reply semantics.\n\nThere are four functions upon contexts:\n\n\nContext types are \"Singletons\", \"Bags\" or \"Streams\" and can be subscripted arrays.\n\nEase has a \"semiotic definition\".

{"id": "1968696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968696", "title": "Abbreviated dialing", "text": "Abbreviated dialing\n\nAbbreviated dialing is the use of a very short digit sequence to reach specific telephone numbers, such as those of public services. The purpose of such numbers is to be universal, short, and easy to remember. Typically they are two or three digits.\n\nCarriers refer to the shortened number sequences as \"abbreviated dialing codes\" (ADCs). Unlike SMS shortcodes, they are generally not automatically synchronized across carriers. ADCs are provisioned separately for mobile networks versus landline networks.\n\nThe most commonly known examples are emergency telephone numbers such as 9-9-9, 1-1-2 and 9-1-1. Other services may also be available through abbreviated dialing numbers, such as the other of the eight N11 codes of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) besides 9-1-1. State highway departments in recent years have used abbreviated dialing codes to allow drivers to obtain information about road conditions or to reach the state highway patrol. Examples are *55 in Missouri and Oklahoma, or *FHP which connects to the Florida Highway Patrol. In December 2019, the Federal Communications Commission proposed making 9-8-8 a national number in the United States for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\nFor text messaging, the technical equivalent is a short code; however, these are rented by their private users rather than being universal and for public services.\n\nVertical service codes may also be considered as abbreviated dialing, though these are often prefixed by the special touch-tone characters * and # (or often 11 for pulse dialing) instead of using only numerals. Most are used to access calling features rather than a called party, and some are specific to each telephone company. Some are used only locally or regionally (such as *FHP (*347) to reach the Florida Highway Patrol); other codes as short as one numeral (like *1) are used to report breaking news or traffic to the newsrooms of local news radio or TV stations.\n\nA mobile dial code (MDC) is a phone number, typically preceded by a * or #, that allows the request and receipt of information directly to a mobile phone. MDC's are also known in carrier terminology as \"abbreviated dialing codes\" (ADC's). Mobile dial codes are dialed just like a regular telephone number. The caller can be presented with any one of a variety of responses that an advertiser defines - a voice or IVR call, a text message, a video or audio clip, a mobile coupon, game or an application.\n\nThese types of dialing options can be used for a number of things. #250 (pound two-fifty) is an MDC commonly used in radio marketing. Callers are able to use #250 for a voice-activated, hands-free connection to a business. Callers are prompted to say a keyword, which corresponds to an advertiser (e.g. \"Liberty\" causes a connection to Liberty University). #250 is now available through Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and, more recently, U.S. Cellular.\n\n"}

It lies about halfway between the lunar equator and southern pole, across the southern rim of the larger walled plain Roche.\n\nThis crater has a well-defined outer rim that is only mildly worn by impact erosion. A small crater lies on the inner side along the south, and another on the opposite face of the crater to the north.

The inner wall is narrower along the northern side where it overlies Roche.\n\nThe interior floor has been flooded with lava, leaving a low-albedo surface that is darker than the surrounding terrain. In this respect it is similar to the crater Jules Verne located about four crater diameters to the northeast.

The Ligue began as a non-partisan nationalist league calling for 'revanche' (revenge for the French defeat during the Franco-Prussian War) against Germany, and literally means \"League of Patriots\". One of the original purposes of the Ligue was to offer pre-military training, allowing members to participate in gymnastics and rifle shooting.\n\nThe league was formed with Léon Gambetta's blessing, and Gambetta's education ministry included Déroulède in its Military Education Commission, which was also formed in 1882. However, during the Boulanger Affair, Déroulède co-opted the ligue to support the general, alienating many Republican members. After Boulanger's exile in 1889, the Ligue was suppressed by the French government.\n\nUpon the discovery that Victoria, the future German Empress, had stayed in Versailles and Saint-Cloud (a town destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War) during her unofficial visit to France in 1891, the Ligue incited a public uproar. The disorder surrounding the visit eventually resulted in the Crown Princess cutting her trip short and being escorted under French military protection, for her safety, to Calais to board a ship to England.\n\nIn 1898, the Ligue was revived to become involved in the Dreyfus Affair engaging in noisy and often violent anti-Semitic, right-wing protests. At this stage, the Ligue is estimated to have had 60,000 members, largely in Paris.\n\nAfter a failed coup in 1899, Paul Déroulède was sentenced to exile from France for 10 years and the Ligue was dissolved. But the nationalist author Maurice Barrès became again its leader in 1914, at the eve of World War I.\n\n"}

Founded in 1891, it changed location several times in its early years before settling into its present campus at 601 Pico Boulevard. It is a part of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District.\n\nIn 1891, the Union High School Law was passed in Santa Monica, thereby establishing a four-year high school for the city. The first graduating class graduated in 1894. The \"new\" campus opened in 1912 with one building, the current History Building, with an enrollment of 50 students. The school sits on the hilltop between 4th and 7th streets and Pico and Olympic Blvds., from which one can see the Pacific Ocean. Ten years later the campus was expanded with construction of the English building. In 1921, the Open Air Memorial Theater (now called the Greek Amphitheatre) was built to honor the Santa Monicans who served in World War I. One of the best examples of the classical Greek style in Southern California, the amphitheater was built after Santa Monica passed a $30,000 bond measure to fund its construction. Barnum Hall Theater, originally called \"the Auditorium,\" was built in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to be the Civic Auditorium of Santa Monica and host school events as well. The campus also added six buildings during this period: the Language, English, Business, History, Administration and Music Buildings.\n\nIn 1952, Santa Monica High School was finally expanded to what it is now, , and two new buildings were built, the Science and Technology D.M. Buildings. As the school aged, renovations took place in Barnum Hall and the Music Building was completely rebuilt. As of February 2015, a new Science and Technology Building — known as the Innovation Building — has been constructed along with an outdoor gathering space called Centennial Plaza. On September 10, 2015, during \"Back to School Night\" the Innovation Building was unveiled to the public.\n\nIn 2003, Samohi adopted a house system, similar to college house systems; each student is part of a house. There are five houses: \"S, M, O, H\" and \"I\", with each house assigned a building or a floor of a building. \"S\" House is stationed in the Language Building, \"M\" house is on the first floor of the History Building, \"O\" house is on the second floor of the History Building, \"H\" house is stationed in the English Building, and \"I\" house is stationed in the new Innovation Building. The \"A\" house was cut due to the California budget cuts to public schools. A principal oversees each of the houses, along with two counselors.

{"id": "1968737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968737", "title": "Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge", "text": "Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge\n\nThe Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, also known as the Ravenel Bridge and the Cooper River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Cooper River in South Carolina, USA, connecting downtown Charleston to Mount Pleasant. The bridge has a main span of 1,546 feet (471 m), the third longest among cable-stayed bridges in the Western Hemisphere. It was built using the design-build method and was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff.\n\nThe first bridge to cross the lower Cooper River opened in 1929, eventually named the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge for former Charleston mayor John P. Grace, who spearheaded the project. The main span of the double cantilever truss bridge was the fifth-longest in the world at 1,050 feet (320 m) and soared 150 feet (46 m) above the river. The main span of the second cantilever was the twelfth-longest in the world. The total length of the structure was about . Following a 17-month construction at a cost of $6 million, it opened with a 3-day celebration that attracted visitors from around the globe. Engineers and critics proclaimed colorful descriptions of the unique structure, deeming it \"the first roller-coaster bridge\" and citing that \"steep approaches, stupendous height, extremely narrow width, and a sharp curve at the dip conspire to excite and alarm the motorist.\" Privately owned originally, a $1.00 toll was charged for car and driver to cross. In 1943 the state of South Carolina purchased the bridge, and the tolls were lifted in 1946.\n\nBy the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge had become insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades of up to 6 percent. Later changes to the side rail and curb reduced the lane width further. A new bridge was constructed alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning \"Use lanes with green arrow\" and \"Do not use red X lane\" on the bridge.\n\nThe two truss bridges had become functionally obsolete by 1979. Extensive metal deterioration caused by the lack of maintenance shortly after Grace Bridge's tolls were removed limited the capacity of the older Grace bridge to ten ton vehicles (later five tons), and the reversible lane on the Pearman was eliminated (it had been able to switch to three lanes northbound for rush hour traffic), making that lane southbound permanently, diverting all heavy trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles to that lane on the Pearman bridge. Neither of the bridges had emergency lanes, and the Pearman bridge had no median between the northbound and southbound lanes because of its reversible lane, and it was not until 2002 when flexible barriers were added to the Pearman bridge to prevent head-on collisions.\n\nFurthermore, the vertical clearance above the river – once among the highest in the world – could no longer accommodate modern shipping vessels. Three of Charleston's four shipping terminals are situated up the Cooper and Wando Rivers, and the limited bridge clearance excluded the access of ships that would otherwise be beneficial to the economy of South Carolina. Now that the old bridges are disassembled, the world's largest modern container ships are able to access all terminals of the nation's fourth-largest container port.\n\nRaising financial support for a new eight-lane bridge over the Cooper River was a struggle 20 years in the making, prolonged by the state's insistence that it could not afford such a bridge and by Charleston's reluctance to provide any funds for the project. Several proposals were made for a toll bridge, but the mayors of Charleston and Mount Pleasant objected. When officials revealed in 1995 that the Grace Bridge scored a 4 out of 100 for safety and integrity, retired U.S. Congressman Arthur Ravenel Jr. ran for the South Carolina Senate with a goal of solving the funding problem. He helped to establish the S.C. Infrastructure Bank and worked with local, state, and federal officials to create partnerships that helped to materialize the final funding.\n\nThe State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) budgeted $325 million to accompany $96.6 million from the Federal Highway Administration. The project did not become a reality, however, until the SIB agreed to commit to a $215 million federal loan, provided that Charleston County would contribute $3 million a year for 25 years, including an 8.33% sales tax increase, to the federal loan, as well as yearly payments from the SCDOT and State Ports Authority. The overall price of the bridge totaled around $700 million.\n\nDue to his efforts in passing laws for the new bridge's funding, fellow lawmakers voted to name bridge the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. Some felt that the bridge should not be named after Ravenel, with the head of the South Carolina infrastructure bank saying in 1999, \"Certainly, Arthur Ravenel is a fine, decent person, but that bridge is bigger than any one individual and it should reflect all the qualities of the state and not some state senator who happens to be in the Legislature the time the structure is being built.\"\n\nThe Ravenel Bridge is a cable-stayed suspension design with two diamond-shaped towers, each 575 feet (175 m) high. The total length of the structure is 13,200 feet (4.0 km), with the main span stretching 1,546 feet (471 m) between the towers. 128 individual cables anchored to the inside of the diamond towers suspend the deck 186 feet (57 m) above the river. The roadway consists of eight 12-foot (3.7 m) lanes, four in each direction plus a bicycle and pedestrian path, which runs along the south edge of the bridge overlooking Charleston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe bridge structure is designed to withstand shipping accidents and the natural disasters that have plagued Charleston's history. The span is designed to endure wind gusts in excess of 300 mph (480 km/h), far stronger than those of the worst storm in Charleston's history, Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Engineers also considered the 1886 earthquake that nearly leveled Charleston. The Ravenel Bridge is designed to withstand an earthquake of approximately 7.4 on the Richter magnitude scale without total failure. To protect the bridge from errant ships, the towers are flanked by one-acre rock islands. Ships will run aground on the islands before colliding with the towers.\n\nThe bridge was designed for traffic of 100,000 vehicles per day, and forecasted to reach that number in 2030. , the bridge was carrying an average of 96,300 vehicles per day. The bridge includes a shared bicycle-pedestrian path named \"Wonders' Way\" in memory of Garrett Wonders. Wonders was a US Navy ensign stationed in Charleston and was in training for the 2004 Olympics before he died in a bicycle-vehicle collision. The path was included in design of the new bridge because of grassroots efforts by groups such as a fifth grade class at a local elementary school.\n\nGroundbreaking on the bridge occurred in 2001 in Mount Pleasant. The bridge was built as a design-build project, meaning that one contract was signed to both design and construct the bridge. This meant that construction could begin even while the design was not yet finalized. The bridge was built by a joint venture of two major construction firms operating under the name \"Palmetto Bridge Constructors\". The joint venture partners were Tidewater Skanska of Norfolk, Virginia and Flatiron Constructors of Longmont, Colorado. The construction joint venture hired Parsons Brinckerhoff to complete the design. For the sake of simplifying labor and equipment resources, Palmetto Bridge Constructors actually managed the building of the bridge as five separate projects (the two highway interchanges at either end of the bridge, the two approach spans, and the cable-stayed span) going on simultaneously.\n\nBy the summer of 2002 the foundations for the towers and most of the piers were in place and the rock islands were completed. The steel and concrete towers began to ascend from the islands soon after. Originally, each of the towers was to be topped with a multicolored LED \"beacon,\" but public opinion caused this plan to be scrapped.\n\nThe fast-paced construction schedule led to contractors to use a self-climbing form system to build the towers. The formwork, supplied by PERI, provided a solution to meet the tight construction tolerances and provide safe access for workers laboring hundreds of feet in the air. The self-climbing system meant that the tower cranes did not have to spend time raising the forms after each segment of concrete hardened, and instead could be better used to haul material from barges below.\n\nThe first cables were hung from the towers in 2004—as a time-saving measure, this was done before the towers were wholly completed. Sections of the deck were built outward from each of the towers as more cables were hung.\nThe decks of the approaches were taking shape as well. Construction of part of the roadway actually occurred over the top of the old cantilever bridges, which remained open to traffic without interruption.\n\nA ceremony was held in March 2005, when the last slab of the deck was added, thus making the bridge \"complete.\" But paving, installation of lights and signs, and cleanup meant that the bridge would not open for another four months.\n\nFollowing a week-long celebration that included a public bridge walk, concerts, dinners, and fireworks, the bridge was dedicated and opened on July 16, 2005 – one year ahead of schedule and under budget. The bridge was featured on the TV show Extreme Engineering.\n\nThe proximity and rivalry between Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah and Brunswick often lead to comparisons between the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, the Sidney Lanier Bridge, and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, all of which carry US 17. Completed in 2005, the clearance under the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is actually only taller than both the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge. Unlike the Sidney Lanier Bridge and the Talmadge Memorial Bridge, however, the Ravenel Bridge has eight travel lanes; the Talmadge and the Sidney Lanier both have just four lanes. The Ravenel also features a dedicated bike/pedestrian lane. The Talmadge Memorial Bridge also has a similar design as the Alex Fraser Bridge in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAs for the span of the three bridges, The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is . The Sidney Lanier Bridge is . The Talmadge Memorial Bridge is .\n\nAs for the total length of the three bridges, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is . The Sidney Lanier Bridge is .

This event attracts up to 50,000 people. The route starts in Mount Pleasant and finishes in downtown Charleston at Marion Square.\n\nThe cover of Darius Rucker's 2010 album \"Charleston, SC 1966\" features a picture of Rucker, a Charleston native, with the Ravenel Bridge in the background.\n\nThe 2014 television series \"Reckless\" features the bridge in its title sequence.\n\nIn the video game \"\" a bridge similar to the Ravenel Bridge was featured but only on the PlayStation 3, Xbox and PC versions. It was also featured in the 2012 version of \"Need for Speed Most Wanted\" (but it only crosses half of the water)\n\nThe 2009 movie \"The New Daughter\", starring Kevin Costner, features the Ravenel Bridge in several scenes as the movie is based in and around Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1968761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968761", "title": "Naim Audio", "text": "Naim Audio\n\nNaim Audio is a British hi-fi manufacturer based in Wiltshire, United Kingdom. The company was founded in 1973. Following a 2011 merger with French loudspeaker manufacturer Focal, Naim is owned by VerVent Audio Group, a French company.\n\nNaim began when Julian Vereker started Naim Audio Visual in 1969 and created a sound-to-light box that he hired out to film production companies. His disappointment with the sound of professional recording equipment at the time led him to design his own power amplifier. The company Naim Audio was incorporated in 1973. Against the conventional wisdom – dating back to audio pioneer Edgar Villchur – that the loudspeakers determined the sound of a hi-fi system, and that amplifiers were simply a means to an end in moving the speakers, Vereker set about to put his ideas into practice.\n\nThe first product Naim put on the market was the NAP160 power amplifier; it was soon followed by the NAC12 pre-amplifier. The two-channel NAP 250 amplifier, launched in 1975, is perhaps Naim Audio's most well-known analogue product, as its basic circuit layout was shared by all the company's power amplifiers until the introduction of the flagship NAP500 in 2000. The Naim NAIT, its first integrated amplifier, \"one of the most controversial and famous integrated amps in the history of HiFi\" has acquired a \"legendary\" status among integrated amplifiers.\n\nIn 1983, Guy Lamotte was hired as a designer. He completed the development of the NA T01 and NAT101 FM tuners and piloted the development of the Hi-Cap power supply and the −5 modifications to the company's burgeoning pre-amplification (NAC42 and 32), the NAXO active crossover and the ARO uni-pivot tonearm (developed jointly with David Beck). Lamotte privately worked on a prototype electrostatic speaker design that attracted media attention. It was brought into the Naim fold in 1987, after the Linn/Naim partnership ended. Roy George, who joined in 1985 and was appointed Technical Director of Naim in 2000, is credited with designing many of Naim's iconic products.\n\nThe company, and its products such as the NAIT, NAC52 pre-amplifier, the ARO uni-pivot tonearm and the SBL (Separate Box Loudspeaker) have assumed cult status among devotees.\n\nThe company was headed by Vereker until his death in 2000, when Paul Stephenson, then sales director, became managing director until 2015. Stephenson saw turnover increase from £6m to £20m and led the company into digital streaming.\n\nNaim has a devoted following, gained through a combination of its products' performance, build quality, upgrade and after-sales philosophy. In terms of after-sales support, Naim boasts they can service all products ever manufactured by them.\n\nTypically, the electronics incorporate over-engineered power supplies to ensure fast and generous current delivery to the audio circuitry. Naim also market independent low-noise power supplies to give its customers easy and effective upgrade paths for their pre-amplifiers and CD players.\n\nInternally, the Naim design approach can be seen by their use of materials –– the semiconductors, heavy toroidal transformers, their obsessive attention to earthing, screening and isolation from electronic and mechanical interference, through to their preference for XLR connector, DIN connector and the BNC connector for phono (as opposed to the RCA connector used by almost all other manufacturers).\n\nUntil 1989, the company's electronics could be readily identified by their heavy black aluminium casing. Since their replacement by the 'olive' range, the earlier vintages are affectionately known as 'chrome bumper' models Electrically, the amplifiers are matched and designed to be used together. Naim warns against experimentation with other manufacturers' components, particularly in the case for some \"high-end\" loudspeaker cables, whose L/C characteristics were said by Naim to present unstable loads to the high-current devices used in Naim power amplifiers.\n\nAs with other brands such as Arcam and Cyrus, the company's instruction manuals state that \"better and more consistent performance will be achieved if the system is left switched on for long periods.\" Many reviewers have also remarked on equipment sounding significantly better several weeks after being left switched on.\n\nDuring much of the 1980s, Naim asserted that Compact Disc was a far inferior medium to the vinyl gramophone record. Early discs often lost something in the transfer compared to vinyl, and Naim continued to design their products in this context. However, by 1990 technological advances allowed the production of the Naim CDS, the first CD player considered worthy of the Naim brand. The announcement in 1989 that the company was working on a CD player shocked the marketplace. The player was unusual for a two-box device in that Naim put the digital–analogue converter in the same box as the transport and audio circuitry, whilst keeping the power supply separate. The Naim CDS has since seen two major revisions (now in its CDS3 incarnation) since its launch in 1991; while subsequent lower-priced extensions to the line are often used by hi-fi reviewers as references at their respective price points. The CD555, which is the \"money no object\" flagship priced at £15,000, is heralded by Naim as \"the ultimate CD player\".\n\nNaim's Digital Audio offering was bolstered in 2017 with the internally labeled 'New Streaming Platform' that became the award-winning Uniti range of streamers, which comprised the Uniti Core, Uniti Nova, Uniti Star and Uniti Atom. The latter received an EISA award for Best All in One System, 2018–19.\n\nDuring much of the 1970s and 80s, Naim adopted a symbiotic relationship with Linn Products, and their names were often mentioned in the same breath. At that time, a Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, Naim electronics and Linn loudspeakers was the preferred combination for many a serious audiophile.\n\nThe two companies had almost the same sales and marketing strategy, and shared many of the same retailers/dealers. As an upstart company, Vereker, the company's founder, was active in marketing and promotion, and appeared in the company's advertising. The company's emphasis on selling products through comparative demonstrations in a single-speaker environment was a move away from marketing space of the chain electronics stores in favour of small independent retailers [in the United Kingdom].\n\nThe two companies diverged during the 1980s, at the dawn of digital audio. This was partly due to the convergence of technology, but also because Naim had significantly fewer dealers than Linn. This presented problems for Linn dealers trying to sell Linn speakers that were specifically designed to work at their best with Naim amplification. Both Naim and Linn began broadening their product ranges and started encroaching on each other's historical areas of expertise: in 1985, Linn launched its LK1/LK2 amplification combination, signalling the definitive end of the partnership. Naim began making loudspeakers and Linn expanded its range of electronic components. In 1987, Naim announced that chief designer Guy Lamotte had been working on a prototype electrostatic speaker design, and that a product launch was imminent. However, the product never saw the light of day, having been axed because of cost escalation. In 1995, Naim announced the launch of the Armageddon power supply for the LP12.\n\nIn 2008, Naim partnered with car manufacturer Bentley in the \"Naim for Bentley\" project, an optional upgrade in-car sound system that had a degree of customer acceptance that surpassed expectations of both partners.\n\nIn 2010, Naim employed 140 staff, with products exported to more than 40 countries and half of its £15 million turnover coming from export. One-third of the business was from CD players. In 2011 and again in 2017, around 60 percent of sales went to export markets.\n\nAt the time of his death, Julian Vereker held half of the share capital of the company. The other half was in the hands of employees, including Paul Stephenson who owned 20 percent. Vereker bequeathed his shares to be held in a trust of which Stephenson is trustee.\n\nOn 19 August 2011, Naim and Focal-JMLab announced a merger of both companies. Focal & Co., the new entity to be formed to own the existing operations would employ 325 people in total at two sites, in Saint Etienne, France, and Salisbury, UK. Pro-forma annual turnover of the new company was £48 million. The Naim and Focal brands would continue to operate independently, while collaborating on R&D.\n\nThe shareholders of Focal & Co are those that respectively owned the company prior to the merger (namely Jacques Mahul, CM-CIC and the management of Focal and Naim), suggesting the merger being executed by an exchange of shares for shares in the holding company. No ownership statistics and no valuation were mentioned.\n\nSince 2014, the combined company has been backed by Naxicap Partners, a French private equity firm. Focal and Naim are subsidiaries of VerVent Audio Group, a French company.\n\nIn August 2017, Focal.JMLab UK Limited, the distributor of Focal speakers in the UK, was merged into Naim Audio Limited.\n\nNaim entered into the record business to supply compact discs which were technically and musically good enough to satisfy analogue/vinyl disciples. The first CD to appear on the Naim record label was \"Electric Glide\" by Gary Boyle, one of the company's favourite vinyl demo records. Naim's Marketing Director Ryan Latham guided the record label until 2018, with James Tailby taking over in June.\n\n\n\"Source\": Naim Audio\n"}

The oldest of these is held by the Indian think tank Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) in New Delhi, India. This conference brings together globally renowned scholars who interact with senior members of IDSA as well as senior members of the Indian Government. The 12th Annual Asian Security Conference was hosted by IDSA from 11–13 February. These conferences are by invitation only. At the 2010 Conference, the Indian Defence Minister and Indian Defence Secretary both played key roles. The conference annually explores issues of security affecting South Asia. Attendees for the 2010 Conference included senior academics from the United States, Pakistan, Russia, Iran, India, and the United Kingdom, among others. Notable names included G. John Ikenberry, and Aaron Friedburg from Princeton, Summit Ganguly from the Indiana University, John Geis from Air University.\n\nThere is a more recently developed \"'Asia Security Conference\",' which is an annual event organised by International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). The conference is also known as Shangri-La Dialogue. The first conference was held on 2002 and the success prompted the organisers to make it an annual event. The 8th edition of the conference was held from 29 to 31 May 2009 in Singapore.\n\nAustralia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor Leste, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam are the countries that participated in the 2009 conference.\n\nThe main focus of the meet was shipping security, fighting terrorism and the North Korea's nuclear ambition. The conference was of a particular importance in the backdrop of North Korea's nuclear as well as missile test. There was also criticism that the meeting was organised for achieving peace in the region but the participating countries were more interested in private meetings to discuss weapons purchases.\n\nThe 2005 talks was held in Singapore and focused issues including the U.S.-led War on Terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the emergent roles for India and China in Asian regional security.\n\n18 countries represented at the ministerial-level: Korea, Australia, Cambodia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThrough this Conference, it was found that the United States might have done something wrong in \"dealing with this whole terrorism mess.\"\n"}

{"id": "1968785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968785", "title": "Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)", "text": "Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)\n\nThe Washington Avenue Bridge carries County Road 122 and the METRO Green Line light rail across the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota and connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the University of Minnesota campus. The bridge has two decks, with the lower deck designated for motor vehicle traffic and light rail trains and the upper deck used for pedestrians and bicycles (lanes specifically for bikes are on the north side). It is a utilitarian structure with simple architecture, but it has cultural significance because thousands of students, faculty, staff, and visitors walk across it every day.\n\nMost users of the bridge get across it using some mode other than a personal automobile. Mn/DOT traffic counts from 2007 show the bridge carried about 28,400 vehicles per day at that time. However, multiple counts from 2009 indicate the bridge carried a total of 71,400 people per day when other modes were also included. The greatest single mode was still motor vehicles at 37.6%, but 32.7% used bus transit, 19.9% walked, and 9.6% used bicycles, with a remaining 0.3% using other methods such as inline skating. The bridge is a cycling hot spot and, with 6,850 riders per day, may carry more bikes than any other route in Minneapolis.\n\nIn 2011, as part of construction for the METRO Green Line light rail, reconfiguration of the bridge began. The original two eastbound and westbound traffic lanes were permanently reduced to one lane eastbound and one lane westbound, using the outside lanes. The two inside (center) lanes are now dedicated to light rail. The light rail line opened on June 14, 2014.\n\nAn iron truss bridge was first built here in 1884, slightly upstream from the current location (connecting Washington Avenue on both sides of the river). At the time of construction, many people lived in the river flats area below, a neighborhood known as Bohemian Flats (See photo below). The bridge was strengthened in 1890 to accommodate streetcars, and it made up part of the first interurban line between Minneapolis and neighboring Saint Paul (see Twin City Rapid Transit). Streetcar service ended in 1954. Construction of the current bridge began in 1962 and the 1884 bridge was torn down in 1965.\nThis first structure was a straight east-west bridge carrying Washington Avenue, which continued directly into downtown. The new bridge aimed the west end slightly to the south, so Washington Avenue is now disjointed at that point. Continuing straight along the roadway will carry a vehicle into downtown along a short freeway-like section that meets 3rd Street South (a one-way—returning involves traveling along 4th Street).\n\nThe top deck on the new bridge was originally just a flat space. Traversing the bridge in the harshness of winter was very uncomfortable, so an enclosure running down the center of the pedestrian area was added by the 1970s. Originally meant to be a heated indoor pedestrian area, due to energy cost concerns, the walkway is mostly unheated. There are some heaters inside that keep the area slightly warmer than outside, and some heat loss from the steam mains, but it can still dip below the freezing point. The structure also adds a windbreak for the top level, improving conditions for people who choose to walk outside. In the summer, large overhangs also provide some shade.\nAt least one designer had much grander plans. Winston Close, an adviser from the university to the architectural team, envisioned modeling the top level on the Ponte Vecchio bridge in Florence, Italy. This would have included shops, making the bridge a place to stay rather than just get across. Some effort has been put into making the site a more inviting place. The addition of the upper deck enclosure led to an annual artistic event held on the first few days of classes, where organizations of all stripes can put their brushes to panels lining the interior. While most are self-promotional messages from campus groups, some of the panels always show impressive designs.\n\nThe exterior of the bridge had a rather drab combination of brown and gray for most of its existence. Some felt that it was off-balance in its university surroundings, especially after the Frank Gehry-designed Weisman Art Museum went into place next to the east end in the 1990s. University President Mark Yudof led a \"Take Pride in U\" campaign in 1997 where the top level was painted in the school colors of maroon and gold. Later, in the first decade of the 2000s, the superstructure was also painted over the course of about two years. This had to be arranged with Hennepin County, which owns the bridge. It took a long time to repaint because the old paint contained lead and had to be carefully removed.\nA darker facet of the bridge's history is its association with suicide. Poet and university professor John Berryman is the most famous person to have killed himself at the site, when he jumped from the bridge in 1972. About a half-dozen others have also died by landing in the river or on the flats area.\n\nIn August 2008, concerns about the strength of the upper level led Hennepin County to restrict the pedestrian and bicycle traffic to a 14-foot-wide section in the center. Engineers had decided that in preparation for repairs, the weight needed to be moved to the center, where there was support from the columns below. Usage of the upper deck continued to be restricted for about a year until repairs were complete.\n\nThe 1965 bridge was designed as a fracture-critical structure, meaning that it lacked redundancy in its design and could have collapsed if any single one of certain load-bearing members were to fail. Upgrades strengthened the bridge to help it carry the rail vehicles and added redundancy so that the failure of a single bridge member would not cause a catastrophe. The bridge was reduced to one lane in each direction in early 2011 as part of construction of the METRO Green Line and upper deck traffic has been shifted to one half of the bridge.\n\nOn 16 May 2011, Washington Avenue just east of the bridge was permanently closed to personal motor vehicle traffic. The roadway was converted into an exclusive use transit mall between Pleasant and Walnut Streets, so all eastbound lower-level traffic other than buses and emergency vehicles must exit to East River Parkway/Delaware Street and the only westbound access to the bridge for most cars will be from Pleasant Street Southeast.\n\nHistorically, the Washington Avenue Bridge carried U.S. Highway 12 and U.S. Highway 52, but those highways were officially rerouted along nearby Interstate 94 in the 1980s. The roadway appears to have been briefly designated as Minnesota State Highway 12. The road corridor between Interstate 35W in the west and University Avenue in the east was soon designated as Minnesota State Highway 122, but that ended in 1997 when Hennepin County took over control of the roadway from the Minnesota Department of Transportation.\n\n\n"}

She had been modelling for several years when she replaced Maarja Kivi on bass in the group in 2004, having met the other members of the group a year earlier. A key factor, allegedly, in her being selected to join the group was the similarities between her and Kivi's appearance. Kivilaan was (by several years) the youngest member of the group, and continued with her education despite Vanilla Ninja's busy schedule.\n\nWhen Kivilaan joined the group, Vanilla Ninja had already been chosen to represent Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Kivilaan's arrival jeopardised Vanilla Ninja's participation in the Contest, as she was only 15 years old, and after the appearance of young participants such as 1986 winner Sandra Kim, the Eurovision had set an age requirement that all participants must be at least 16. Kivilaan initially claimed to be 17 years old, but the Swiss selectors doubted this and discovered her true age. For a while it looked like the group would have to withdraw, but the fact that Kivilaan would reach her 16th birthday four months before the Contest meant that the European Broadcasting Union allowed the girls to compete.\n\nKivilaan would eventually leave Vanilla Ninja in December 2005, with the other three members (Lenna Kuurmaa, Katrin Siska and Piret Järvis) deciding to continue as a trio. The reasons given by the group when announcing the decision was that Kivilaan had left by \"mutual consent\", and that creative differences were the main reason for her leaving.\n\nDuring her time in the group, Triinu only played a bit part in Vanilla Ninja's songs, despite her replacing the group's original lead singer. Kivilaan mostly only provided backing vocals and basic instrumentation during live performances, and was essentially separated from the other three members during their semi-final and final performances at the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Kivilaan also only appeared sparingly in the group's music videos, with the exception of \"When The Indians Cry\", in which she featured prominently.\n\nAfter leaving Vanilla Ninja, Triinu expressed a desire to return to the music industry once she completes her studies, as a solo artist.\n\n\n"}

The film was inspired by the 1951 Alfred Hitchcock thriller \"Strangers on a Train\", which is also seen in the film.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success. Anne Ramsey was singled out for praise for her portrayal of the overbearing Mrs. Lift; she won a Saturn Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nNovelist Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) struggles with writer's block due to his resentment towards his ex-wife Margaret (Kate Mulgrew), who took all the credit for his manuscript and received acclaim for it, whilst Larry, struggling to make ends meet, takes a job teaching literature at a community college. Owen Lift (Danny DeVito) is a timid, middle-aged fellow who still lives with his overbearing, abusive and paranoid mother (Anne Ramsey). Owen fantasizes about killing his mother but can't summon the courage to bring his desires into fruition. As a student in Larry's class, Owen is given advice by Larry to view an Alfred Hitchcock film to gain some insight into plot development for his mystery stories. He sees \"Strangers on a Train\", in which two strangers conspire to commit a murder for each other, figuring their lack of connection to the victim will, in theory, establish a perfect alibi. Having overheard Larry's public rant that he wished his ex-wife dead, Owen forms a plan to kill Margaret, believing that Larry will, in return, kill his mother.\n\nHe tracks Margaret down to Hawaii and eventually follows her onto a cruise ship she is taking to her book signing, where he plans to push her overboard. Owen returns from Hawaii to tell Larry of Margaret's death and that Larry now \"owes\" him the murder of his mother, lest he inform the police that Larry was the killer. After having spent the night drinking alone during the hours of Margaret's disappearance, Larry panics because he lacks a sufficient alibi. That, along with a news report announcing that the police suspect foul play, convinces Larry that he's the prime suspect. He decides to stay with Owen and his mother in an attempt to hide from the police. Larry meets Mrs. Lift, but despite her harsh treatment of him he refuses to kill her. Eventually, when Mrs. Lift drives Owen to the breaking point, Larry finally relents and agrees to go through with the murder.\n\nAfter two unsuccessful attempts, Larry flees the Lift home when Mrs. Lift recognizes him as a suspect from a news broadcast about his ex-wife's disappearance. He boards a train to Mexico and, surprisingly, Owen and Mrs. Lift come along so as to avoid having to lie for him. During the journey, Larry's patience with Mrs. Lift finally runs out when she impolitely gives him advice on writing. He follows her to the caboose with the intent of throwing her from the train, but Owen begins having second thoughts about having his mother killed and gives chase. In the ensuing fight, Mrs. Lift falls from the train but is rescued by Owen and a repentant Larry. Mrs. Lift is grateful at her son for saving her, but unappreciative of Larry's help and kicks him, resulting in him losing his balance, landing on the tracks and breaking his leg.\n\nDuring his recovery in hospital, Larry discovers that Margaret is still alive; she had fallen overboard accidentally and was rescued by a Polynesian fisherman whom she has decided to marry. Much to his annoyance, Larry learns that Margaret plans to sell the rights of her ordeal for $1.5 million. On the advice of a fellow patient, Larry chooses to free himself of his obsession with his ex-wife and instead focus on his own life, thereby freeing him of his writer's block.\n\nA year later, Larry has finished a novel based on his experiences with Owen and Mrs. Lift entitled \"Throw Momma from the Train\". Owen visits and informs him that his mother has died (albeit naturally) and that he's going to New York City for the release of his own book. Unfortunately for Larry, Owen reveals that his book is also about their experiences together. Thinking that his book has been scooped once again, an enraged Larry proceeds to strangle him, but stops when Owen shows him that his book is a children's pop-up book called \"Momma, and Owen, and Owen's Friend, Larry\" with the story drastically altered to be suitable for children. Months later, Larry, Owen, and Larry's girlfriend Beth (Kim Greist) vacation together in Hawaii, reflecting on the final chapter of Larry's book. Larry and Owen's books have now become best-sellers, making them both successful writers as well as close friends.\n\n\nFarley Granger and Robert Walker appear via archive footage from \"Strangers on a Train\" as Guy Haines and Bruno Anthony, respectively.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 63% based on reviews from 35 critics, with the consensus being that \"Danny DeVito's direction is too broad to offer the kind of nastiness that would have made \"Throw Momma from the Train\" truly special, but DeVito's on-screen chemistry with co-star Billy Crystal makes this a smoothly entertaining comedy.\" Audiences polled by Cinemascore gave the film a C+ grade on a scale from A+ to F.\n\n"}

Several songs contain overt political references. \"You and Me,\" like \"Question\" from two years earlier, alludes to ongoing wars and conflicts, including Vietnam. \nHowever, although the album showcases political concerns, in the 1990 documentary \"The Moody Blues: Legend of a Band\", bassist John Lodge described \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" as a response to fans who mistakenly read guru-like wisdom into the Moodies' lyrics. Instrumentally, singer/keyboardist Mike Pinder, in addition to the Mellotron, used a similar keyboard device called the Chamberlin.\n\n\"Seventh Sojourn\" reached #5 in the United Kingdom, and became the band's first American chart topper, spending five weeks at #1 to close out 1972.\n\nTwo hit singles came from this album: \"Isn't Life Strange\" (#13 UK, #29 US) and \"I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)\" (#36 UK, #12 US). However, both songs were overshadowed by the re-release of \"Nights in White Satin,\" which had been first released in 1967.

It was released on August 29, 2005. It was their first album after signing with Roadrunner Records.\n\n\"Ghost Reveries\" is the first album by Opeth to include keyboardist Per Wiberg as a \"permanent\" member (although Wiberg contributed keyboard work to Opeth's live performances starting around the time of \"Lamentations\"), and it is the last Opeth album to include drummer Martin Lopez and long-time guitarist Peter Lindgren.\n\nThe album's only single is \"The Grand Conjuration\". A music video of the song was released, although about half of the song was edited from the video, due to the length of the song. Lopez does not appear in the video, as he was sick and was temporarily replaced by Gene Hoglan.\n\nFor the first time since \"Still Life\", the songs for \"Ghost Reveries\" were written for the album before going into the studio. This gave Opeth three weeks to rehearse and perfect the recording in the studio. The band had to decide whether to record the album at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro, Sweden, or at Sonic Ranch. They eventually chose Fascination Street Studios, as it was closer to their homes.\n\nThe album marks a temporary return to the progressive metal styles of the previous albums and features death growls, though still includes some of the progressive rock elements of \"Damnation\".\n\n\"Ghost Reveries\" was initially intended to be a concept album, with numerous tracks linking together a story of a man's turmoil after committing an unconscionable act, symbolised by killing his own mother.

{"id": "1968876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968876", "title": "Video game clone", "text": "Video game clone\n\nA video game clone is either a video game or video game console very similar to, or heavily inspired, by a previous popular game or console. Clones are typically made to take financial advantage of the popularity of the cloned game or system, but clones may also result from earnest attempts to create homages or expand on gameplay ideas presented in the original game. Legally, video game clones are not generally considered to be copyright infringement as gameplay elements are broadly uncopyrightable, an essential factor for creative development of new games based on past ideas. More recent case law has identified that game developers can protect their games' look and feel from clones, while methods like patents, trademarks, and industry regulation also help to fend off clones.\n\nCloning a game in digital marketplaces is common. It is hard to prevent and easy to compete with existing games. Developers can copyright the graphics, title, story, and characters, but have more difficulty protecting software design and game mechanics. A patent for the mechanics is possible but expensive and time-consuming. Popular game concepts often lead to that concept becoming incorporated or expanded upon by other developers. In other cases, games may be developed with clear influence from one or more earlier games. Such derivations are not always considered clones though the term may be used to make a comparison between games. As copyright law does not protect gameplay concepts, the reuse of such ideas is generally considered acceptable. For example, \"Grand Theft Auto III\" spurred a number of games that have been called GTA clones but which are not direct copies of assets or gameplay ideas. In these cases, games that are \"clones\" of another are generally not implied to have committed any intellectual property infractions, and otherwise considered legally acceptable practices, although calling such games clones is generally considered derogatory.\n\nTrue video games clones occur when competitors, on seeing the success of a video game title, attempt to compete by creating a near-copy of the existing game with similar assets and gameplay with little additional innovation; developer Jenova Chen compared the nature of these clones similar to plagiarism in which there is little attempt to distinguish the new work from the original. Video game clones are seen by those developing them as low risk; knowing that a game or genre is popular, developing a clone of that game would appear to be a safe and quick investment, in contrast with developing a new title with unknown sales potential. Further, cloning of games from smaller developers, particularly indie developers, is more frequent as these small teams lack the financial resources to pursue legal recourse. Instead, these teams often appeal to social influence to try to have the cloner take corrective actions.\n\nCloning of video games came as early within the first generation of consoles in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of the home console version of \"Pong\", released by Atari. Released first as an arcade game in 1972, \"Pong\" was highly successful, leading to the development of the dedicated home version by 1975. Atari's version of \"Pong\" was initially considered a clone of the version of ping-pong that had been built into the Magnavox Odyssey, and Magnavox took legal action against Atari for their home \"Pong\" game. Atari opted to settle out of court by 1976 to avoid legal costs, despite believing they would have won the case. However, at the same time, with \"Pong\" in the marketplace, a number of third-party hardware developers manufacturer numerous \"Pong\" clones on the market, to a point where it was estimated that Atari's \"Pong\" console represented only about a third of sales of home \"Pong\" consoles. Magnavox continued to pursue action against these \"Pong\" clones. As the home console market expanded to other built-in games, clones of these system were also frequent. These dedicated consoles were relatively risk free and easy to manufacture, thus leading to a flooded dedicated-game console market. Cloning would continue as home video game consoles became popular, and in part, the number of clones being produced and saturating the market were considered part of the reason for the video game market crash in 1983.\n\nEventually, home consoles switched from built-in games to cartridge-based systems within the second generation, making it more difficult to clone at the hardware level. However, off-brand manufacturers attempted to make bootleg copies of these consoles that has a similar form as the known console, but typically could only play built in games frequently on a liquid-crystal display (LCD). Other bootleg consoles would take the workings of older systems and repackage them in a newer housing that appears like the known consoles capable of playing the games from the original system. The latter was particularly true of consoles that attempted to clone the Nintendo Entertainment System (known as the Famicom system in Japan), which was not available in some countries in the Eastern European and Chinese regions, leading manufacturers within those nations to make numerous bootleg versions, knowing that it would be near-impossible for Nintendo to seek legal action against them.\nWhile hardware itself became difficult to clone, the software of games were subsequently used in unlicensed copies for other systems. Cloning of arcade games was popular during the arcade's \"golden age\" in the early 1980s. Arcade games, prior to mass production, were made in limited numbers for field testing in public spaces; once news got out that a new arcade game from industry leaders like Atari was out in the open, third-party competitors would be able to scope the game and rush to make a clone of the game, either as a new arcade game or for home consoles; an occurrence which happened with \"Missile Command\" in 1980. This ultimately diluted the market for new arcade games. \"BYTE\" reported in December 1981 that at least eight clones of Atari, Inc.'s arcade game \"Asteroids\" existed for personal computers. The magazine stated in December 1982 that that year \"few games broke new ground in either design or format ... If the public really likes an idea, it is milked for all it's worth, and numerous clones of a different color soon crowd the shelves. That is, until the public stops buying or something better comes along. Companies who believe that microcomputer games are the hula hoop of the 1980s only want to play Quick Profit\". The degree of cloning was so great that in 1981, Atari warned in full-page advertisements \"Piracy: This Game is Over\", stating that the company \"will protect its rights by vigorously enforcing [its] copyrights and by taking appropriate action against unauthorized entities who reproduce or adapt substantial copies of ATARI games\", like a home-computer clone.\n\nThird parties continued to attempt or clone concepts or ideas from popular and successful games. Games like \"Tetris\" and \"Breakout\" inspired many games that used similar core concepts but expanded beyond that; the \"Breakout\"-inspired \"Arkanoid\" itself inspired many other clones that built upon its unique additions to \"Breakout\". Gameplay elements of \"Street Fighter II\" and \"Mortal Kombat\" became common gameplay elements in the fighting game genre, A large number of games that tried to capitalize on the success of the 3D adventure game \"Myst\" were grouped as \"Myst clones\". Some video game genres are founded by archetypal games of which all subsequent similar games are considered derivatives; notably, early first-person shooters were often called \"\"Doom\" clones\", while the success of the open-world formula in \"Grand Theft Auto\" led to the genre of GTA clones. The genre of endless runners is based on the success and simplicity of the game \"Canabalt\". Such cloning can also cause a relatively-sudden emergence of a new genre as developers attempt to capitalize on the interest. The battle royale genre grew rapidly after the success of \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" and \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" across 2017 and 2018, while \"Dota Auto Chess\" released in January 2019 spawned several commercial games in the auto battler genre by mid-2019.\nAnother type of clone arose from developers in the open source and indie game venues, where the developers seek to recreate the gameplay of a popular title through reverse engineering, adding their own creative assets, and releasing the game typically for free and in homage to the original title. This allows the teams and users to expand upon original elements of the commercial game, such as software bugs that were not fixed, improving gameplay concepts, support for newer computers or console systems, or adding new ideas to the base gameplay principles, as well as enabling gameplay extensions through user-generated mods or add-ons. Some examples of these clones include \"Freeciv\" based on the \"Civilization\" series, \"Osu!\" based on \"Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan\", and \"Frets on Fire\" based on \"Guitar Hero\". The open source nature of these clones also enable new utilities, such as developing artificial intelligence agents that have learned and improved their play in \"Freeciv\" which in turn can help advance artificial intelligence research. Such games must be careful not to use the original game's assets or could face legal issues. \"OpenSC2K\", an open-source recreation of \"SimCity 2000\", was shut down by Electronic Arts after it was found that \"OpenSC2K\" used assets from \"SimCity 2000\".\n\nNew concerns related to cloned video games came with the rise of social network and mobile games, typically which were offered as freemium titles to entice new players to play. The low cost, ease and simplicity of the tools needed to develop these made cloning in that sector a significant problem. For example, \"Flappy Bird\" had been cloned dozens of times due to programming code clearinghouses offering templated code to which others could easily add their own art assets. The creators of \"Threes!\" spent 14 months developing the game and tuning its mechanics, but the first clone was released 21 days after \"Threes!\" and the original was quickly overshadowed by \"2048\", a clone that was developed over a weekend. In the early period of social media games around 2012, Zynga had gained a negative reputation of making copycat clones in that space. However, according to their lead gameplay designer, Brian Reynolds, that they see potential new genres and game ideas that gain popularity, and then strive to add their own innovation and concepts to at, so that \"[their] goal is to have the highest-quality thing\".\n\nAnother major area of concern for software clones arises within China. From 2000 to 2015, the Chinese government had numerous restrictions on imports of hardware and software, and access to non-Chinese storefronts. While this allowed gaming on personal computers to flourish within China, the cost of acquiring both hardware and software was too expensive for many, leading to Chinese developers to create low-cost clones of popular Western and Japanese titles for the Chinese market, which persist today. Foreign companies are faced with difficulties in seeking legal action against the Chinese developers that have created these clones, making cloning a far less risky process. Thus, it is common for popular games from both Western and Japanese markets to see near-exact clones appear within China, often within weeks of the original game's release. A notable example is a clone of Blizzard Entertainment's \"Hearthstone\" called \"Sleeping Dragon: Heroes of the Three Kingdoms\" created by Chinese developer Unico, released within a few months of \"Hearthstone\" beta release. Blizzard was ultimately successful in suing Unico for in damages in 2014. In other cases, clones are made to address elements of the original game that are unsuitable under China's content restriction laws; for example, Tencent, which operated the publishing of \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" in China, was forced to pull the game due to content related to violence and terrorism, and instead replaced it with a clone, \"Game for Peace\", which otherwise reused assets from \"Battlegrounds\" but removed blood and gore.\n\nIn present-day law driven by decisions in the United States legal system, video game copyrights come from two forms. The first is by its source code or equivalent, as determined by the 1983 decision in \"Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.\" that software code can be considered a \"literary work\" and thus subject to copyright protection. The second form is as an audiovisual work, as determined in the 1982 case \"Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman\"; while video games present images and sound that are not in a fixed form, the repetitive use of these in a systematic response to player's actions was sufficient for copyright protections as audiovisual works.\n\nIn the United States, the underlying source code, and the game's artistic elements, including art, music, and dialog, can be protected by copyright law.However, gameplay elements of a video game are generally ineligible for copyright; Gameplay concepts fall into the idea–expression distinction that had been codified in the Copyright Act of 1976, in that copyright cannot be used to protect ideas, but only the expression of those ideas. The United States Copyright Office specifically notes: \"Copyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or the method or methods for playing it. Nor does copyright protect any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in developing, merchandising, or playing a game. Once a game has been made public, nothing in the copyright law prevents others from developing another game based on similar principles.\" Courts also consider \"scènes à faire\" (French for \"scenes that must be done\") for a particular genre as uncopyrightable; games involving vampires, for example, would be expected to have elements of the vampire drinking blood and driving a stake through the vampire's heart to kill him. It is generally recognized in the video game industry that borrowing mechanics from other games is common practice and often a boon for creating new games, and their widespread use would make them ineligible for legal copyright or patent protection.\n\nUp until 2012, U.S. courts were reluctant to find for copyright infringement of clones. Driving case law in the United States was principally through the case \"Atari, Inc. v. Amusement World, Inc.\" (547 F. Supp. 222, 1982). Atari had sued Amusement World claiming that its video game \"Meteos\" violated their copyright on \"Asteroids\". The court did find twenty-two similarities between the two games, but ruled against Atari's claims, citing these elements as \"scènes à faire\" for games about shooting at asteroids. The case established that \"look and feel\" of a game could not easily be protected. Attorney Stephen C. McArthur, writing for \"Gamasutra\", said that during this period, courts opted to take a more lax view to balance innovation in the industry and prevent overzealous copyright protection that could have one company claim copyright on an entire genre of games. At best, copyright holders could challenge clones by threatening cease and desist letters, or on other intellectual property rights such as trademarks. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"neither a game’s ‘look and feel’ nor its mechanics are protectable\", according to Nicolas Murfett, a legal associate for Harbottle & Lewis, while the European Union has yet to come to a resolution on the matter.\n\nA shift in legal options for developers to challenge clones arose from the 2012 federal New Jersey district court decision in \"Tetris Holding, LLC v. Xio Interactive, Inc.\" that ruled in favor of The Tetris Company, the licensees of the \"Tetris\" copyright, over the clone \"Mino\", developed by Xio Interactive, which used the same gameplay as \"Tetris\" but with different art assets. The developers for \"Mino\" has cited in their defense that they only used the uncopyrightable gameplay elements of \"Tetris\" in \"Mino\". The court ruled that copyright law was in favor of the Tetris Company's claim, as the gameplay was copied without changes, and while the art assets were new, the \"look and feel\" of \"Mino\" could be easily confused for that of \"Tetris\". While only a district court decision and not binding outside of New Jersey, this served as case law for other developers to fend off \"look-and-feel\" clones. \n\nThe same reasoning was found in a similar case that was occurring nearly simultaneously with the \"Tetris\" decision, in which SpryFox LLC, the developers of the mobile game \"Triple Town\", successfully defended their game from a clone, \"Yeti Town\", developed by 6Waves, through court settlement after the judge gave initially rulings in favor of SpryFox. These rulings suggested that there was copyright protection on the gameplay mechanics despite drastic differences in the games' art assets, though other factors, such as prior agreements between SpryFox and 6Waves, may have also been involved.\n\nBoth the \"Tetris\" and \"Triple Town\" cases have established new but limited case law on \"look and feel\" that can be used to challenge video game clones in court.\n\nPatents are frequently used to protect hardware consoles from cloning. Though patents do not cover elements like the form and shape of a console, they can be used to protect the internal hardware and electronic components. Notably, many of the patents for the Famicom and NES expired in 2003 and 2005, respectively, leading to additional grey market hardware clones within a short time. However, Nintendo had built other intellectual property protection into their system, specifically the 10NES lock-out system, covered by copyright law, that would allow only authorized games to be played on their hardware.\n\nLess frequently, patents have been used to protect video game software elements. Notably, Sega had filed a 1998 United States patent for the gameplay concepts in \"Crazy Taxi\". The company subsequently sued Fox Interactive for patent infringement over their title \"\", citing that the latter game was developed to \"deliberately copy and imitate\" the \"Crazy Taxi\" game. The case was ultimately settled out of court.\n\nAnother approach some companies have used to prevent clones is via trademarks as to prevent clones and knockoffs. Notably, King have gotten a United States trademark on the word \"Candy\" in the area of video games to protect clones and player confusion for their game \"Candy Crush Saga\". They have also sought to block the use of the word \"Saga\" in the trademark filing of \"The Banner Saga\" for similar reasons, despite the games having no common elements. Within the European Union, one can register for a European Union trade mark that includes multimedia elements, which would allow a developer or publisher to trademark a specific gameplay element that is novel from past games, providing a different route for them to protect their work from cloning. For example, Rebellion Developments filed to register its \"Kill Cam\" mechanic as a trademark from its series \"Sniper Elite\" in October 2017, though as of February 2018, the application is still being reviewed.\n\nOther notable legal actions involving video game clones include:\n\n\nMore recently, with the popularity of social and mobile game stores like Apple's App Store for iOS system and Google Play for Android-based systems, a large number of likely-infringing clones have begun appearing. While such storefronts typically include a review process before games and apps can be offered on them, these processes do not consider copyright infringement of other titles. Instead, they rely on the developer of the work that has been cloned to initiate a complaint regarding the clone, which may take time for review. The cloned apps often are purposely designed to resemble other popular apps by name or feel, luring away purchasers from the legitimate app, even after complaints have been filed. Apple has released a tool to streamline claims of app clones to a team dedicated to handle these cases, helping to bring the two parties together to try to negotiate prior to action. While Apple, Google, and Microsoft took steps to stem the mass of clones based on \"Swing Copters\" after its release, experts believe it is unlikely that these app stores will institute any type of proactive clone protection outside of clear copyright violations, and these experts stress the matter is better done by the developers and gaming community to assure the original developer is well known, protects their game assets on release, and gets the credit for the original game.\n\nValve, which operates the Steam digital storefront for games on personal computers, also takes steps to remove games that are clearly copyright-infringing clones of other titles on the service, once notified of the issue.\n\n"}
{"id": "1968893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1968893", "title": "Plain view doctrine", "text": "Plain view doctrine\n\nIn the United States, the plain view doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement that allows an officer to seize evidence and contraband that are found in plain view during a lawful observation. The doctrine is also regularly used by TSA officers while screening persons and property at U.S. airports.\n\nFor the plain view doctrine to apply for discoveries, the three-prong \"Horton\" test requires that:\n\nThe plain view doctrine was first articulated in \"Coolidge v. New Hampshire\". The original formulation included three factors. First, the officer must be lawfully present where (s)he viewed the evidence or contraband. Second, the officer must immediately (without further search) have probable cause to believe the item is either contraband or evidence of a crime. Third, the observation must have been \"inadvertent,\" not anticipated or intended by the officer before the sighting. \n\nIn \"Horton v. California\" the court eliminated the requirement that the discovery of evidence in plain view be \"inadvertent\", which had led to difficulties in defining \"inadvertent discovery.\" In Horton, the Supreme Court upheld the plain view seizure of weapons related to a robbery despite the judge who authorized the warrant specifically declining the officer's request for permission to seize weapons as part of the search. The Horton Court also clarified that the officer must have a \"lawful right of access\" to the objects to seize them under the plain view doctrine. For example, an officer who sees contraband in plain view in someone's home through their window but is not authorized to enter the home cannot rely on the plain view doctrine to enter the home and seize the contraband.\n\nFor the officer to legally seize the item, the officer must have probable cause to believe the item is evidence of a crime or is contraband. The police may not move objects to get a better view, and they may not be in a location unlawfully. These limitations are illustrated in \"Arizona v. Hicks\", 480 U.S. 321 (1987). \n\nFirst, this doctrine only eliminates the warrant requirement, not the probable cause requirement. Investigators normally must get a court-issued warrant before seizing property, by presenting enough evidence to a magistrate judge to meet the probable cause requirement. When using the plain view doctrine, investigators must still have the evidence needed to meet the probable cause requirement, they are only exempt from the step of obtaining a warrant from a judge.\n\nSecond, the doctrine only authorizes \"seizure\" of contraband or evidence. It does not authorize a further search or additional investigation. Therefore, if investigators do not have enough evidence to meet the probable cause requirement, they may not even conduct a relatively nonintrusive search to get probable cause. This is the requirement that the incriminating character of the object must be \"immediately apparent\". In Arizona v. Hicks police officers were in an apartment investigating a shooting and suspected that a record player in the apartment was stolen. The officers could not see the serial number, which was on the bottom of the record player, so they picked the player up and confirmed that it matched the serial number of a record player that had been reported stolen. However, the Supreme Court ruled that picking up the record player constituted an additional search (though a relatively nonintrusive one), because the serial number was not in \"plain view\". This meant that the plain view doctrine didn't apply, and the officers needed a warrant. The evidence of the stolen record player could not be used against the defendant due to the exclusionary rule, which is the remedy available when evidence is obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. This gives rise to the third requirement above: that the incriminating character of the object to be \"immediately apparent.\"\n\nThird, the officer must be lawfully present where they see the item. For example, an officer may not enter the suspect's home without a warrant and rely on the plain view doctrine. However, if an officer is inside a suspect's home under an unrelated warrant, he may rely on the plain view doctrine, subject to the doctrine's other requirements. In Arizona v. Hicks, the police officers were in the apartment under another exception to the warrant requirement, exigent circumstances. This qualified as a lawful entry and the plain view doctrine applied to items the officers could see in the apartment.\n\nThe plain view doctrine has also been expanded to include the sub-doctrines of plain feel, plain smell, and plain hearing. These doctrines are also limited to seizing an item where its nature as contraband or evidence of a crime is \"immediately apparent.\" In Minnesota v. Dickerson, a police officer felt a lump in a suspect's pocket during a lawful pat down search. He did not immediately have probable cause to believe that it was contraband, but proceeded to inspect it further by squeezing it, and then had probable cause to believe that it was a piece of crack cocaine. The U.S. Supreme Court held that this additional inspection was not covered by the plain view doctrine, and the contraband could not be used against the defendant. The Court's reasoning did, however, extend the \"plain view\" doctrine to other senses, such as the sense of touch.\n\nThis question typically arises where a government agent is searching under a warrant for one crime, but finds evidence of a different crime. In United States v. Wong police were searching the defendant's computer for evidence related to a murder when they discovered child pornography on the computer. Though the warrant was specific to evidence of the murder, the Ninth Circuit held that the plain view exception allowed them to seize the child pornography, as searching graphics files was valid under the warrant and the files were immediately identifiable as contraband.\n\nHowever, as with the application of this doctrine elsewhere, the plain view doctrine only justifies a seizure of evidence or contraband that is in plain view. It does not justify a further search. In United States v. Carey a police detective was searching a computer for evidence of drug trafficking. When he opened one .jpg file that turned out to contain child pornography, he proceeded to search for more images and found two hundred and forty four images of child pornography on the computer. The Tenth Circuit held that only the first image was covered by the plain view doctrine, and the rest of the images could not be used against the defendant in court.\n\n\nRayMing Chang, Why the Plain View Doctrine Should Not Apply to Digital Evidence, 12 Suffolk Journal of Trial and Appellate Advocacy 31 (Spring 2007)\n"}

The main reason behind the conversion of \"Exmouth\" was to trial the (then) new Marine Olympus which had been selected as the turbine for the Type 82 destroyer and the Type 19 high-speed anti-submarine frigate. Therefore, she was fitted with a Bristol Siddeley Olympus TM1 of 24,000 shp (limited to due to gearbox and shaft limitations) for full power and two Bristol Siddeley Proteus 10M (3,500 shp each) for fuel-efficient cruising. These engines drove the single shaft through a common gearbox. The Proteus engines could work alone or together, but could not be run together with the Olympus. As the engines could not run in reverse, a reversible-pitch propeller was installed. As the engines could be controlled directly from throttles on the bridge, bridge steering was fitted. The requisite air intakes and filters were grouped amidships and the turbine uptakes exhausted into a common, streamlined funnel, completely changing \"Exmouth\"s appearance. The exhaust and intake trunking was also utilised to allow the removal of complete engines, giving a rapid 24-hour exchange time.\n\n\"Exmouth\" rejoined the fleet on 5 June 1968, and during the 1970s she carried out extended trials to validate the feasibility of all-gas turbine propulsion. The foresight of her conversion was illustrated when after only 64 hours of running, an entire ring of Olympus turbine blades failed. Her test cruises took her to the Mediterranean Sea, where she took part in various trials and exercises based at Malta. She proceeded to Crete which made her the only Type 14 to get this far east. She acted as plane guard for the aircraft carrier and was involved in the search for survivors when a Russian destroyer lost 3 men overboard when making a close pass ahead of \"Ark Royal\" whilst the latter was at flying stations (the men were never found). She eventually returned to her home base port of Chatham in Kent. She then went to the Isle of Portland as a day runner in the 2nd Frigate Squadron, providing support for ships working-up under Flag Officer Sea Training. This was to prove her propulsion in a stop/start scenario – basically press the button, start the engines and sail – which was much less time-consuming than flashing up a steam plant.\n\nThe trials were ultimately successful, and allowed the trouble-free introduction of the Olympus into naval service in the Type 42 destroyer and the Type 21 and two batches of Type 22 frigates. The Olympus was also an export success, and \"Exmouth\"s COGOG arrangement was also widely emulated. \"Exmouth\" was broken up in 1979.\n\n\"The Blackwood class,\" Type 14 \"Second Rate Frigates\", George Moore, in Warship 2001–2002, Conway Maritime Press, 2001, \n\n"}

He is one of the earliest known historical figures to self-identify as a Palestinian during his travels.\n\nOutside of his own work, there is little biographical information available about al-Maqdisi. He is neither found in the voluminous biographies of Ibn Khallikan (d. 1282) nor were the aspects of his life mentioned in the works of his contemporaries.\n\nHe was born in Jerusalem in ca. 946 and belonged to a middle class family whose roots in the city's environs dated from the period approximate to the 7th-century Muslim conquest. According to historian André Miquel, al-Maqdisi \"was very much attached to the Palestine of his birth and to the town whose name he bears\". \"Al-Maqdisī\" or alternatively \"al-Muqaddasī\" was a \"nisba\" indicating that he was from \"Bayt al-Maqdis\" or \"Bayt al-Muqaddas\", the Muslim names for Jerusalem. His paternal grandfather, Abu Bakr al-Banna, had been responsible for the construction of Acre's maritime fortifications under orders from Ahmad ibn Tulun (r. 868–884), the autonomous Abbasid governor of Egypt and Syria. Al-Maqdisi's maternal grandfather, Abu Tayyib al-Shawwa, moved to Jerusalem from Biyar in Khurasan and was also an architect.\n\nAs can be inferred by his work and social background, al-Maqdisi was likely well-educated. Miquel asserts that al-Maqdisi's use of \"rhymed prose, even poetry\" is indicative of a strong knowledge in Arabic grammar and literature. Likewise, his writings show that he possessed an early interest in Islamic jurisprudence, history, philology and hadith.\n\nAl-Maqdisi made his first Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) in 967. During this period, he became determined to devote himself to the study of geography. To acquire the necessary information, he undertook a series of journeys throughout the Islamic world, ultimately visiting all of its lands with the exception of al-Andalus (Iberian Peninsula), Sindh and Sistan. The known dates or date ranges of al-Maqdisi's travels include his journey to Aleppo sometime between 965 and 974, his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 978, a visit to Khurasan in 984 and his stay in Shiraz in 985 when he decided to compose his material. The finished work was titled \"Aḥsan al-taqāsīm fi maʾarfat al-aqalīm\" (\"The Best Divisions for the Knowledge of the Provinces\").\n\nThough possibly influenced by predecessors al-Jahiz (d. 869), who introduced the \"science of countries\", and Ibn al-Faqih (fl. 902), al-Maqdisi \"surpassed\" both \"all to the advantage of what certainly should be called a true geography\", according to Miquel. Moreover, Miquel surmises that al-Maqdisi \"was probably the first to have desired and conceived\" true geography as an \"original science\", an assertion that al-Maqdisi himself makes in the preface of \"Aḥsan al-taqāsīm\". He belonged to the school known as the \"atlas of Islam\", inaugurated by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (d. 934) and developed by Istakhri (d. 957) and al-Maqdisi's contemporary Ibn Hawqal (d. 978).\n\nAl-Balkhi's school almost exclusively dealt with the Islamic world, to which al-Maqdisi too devoted his studies. Al-Maqdisi refers to this world as \"al-mamlaka\" or \"al-Islām\" (the Domain of Islam), a unique concept in which all of the lands of Islam constituted a single domain. He subdivided this domain into two parts: \"mamlakat al-ʿArab\" (domain of the Arabs) and \"mamlakat al-ʿAjam\" (domain of the non-Arabs). The former consisted, from east to west, of the six provinces of Iraq, Aqur (Upper Mesopotamia), Arabia, Syria, Egypt and the Maghreb, while the latter consisted of the eight provinces of the Mashriq (Sistan, Afghanistan, Khurasan and Transoxiana), Sindh, Kirman, Fars, Khuzistan, Jibal, Daylam and Rihab (Armenia, Adharbayjan and Aran).\n\n\"Aḥsan al-taqāsīm\" gives a systematic account of all the places and regions al-Maqdisi had visited. He devoted a section of his book to Bilad al-Sham (the Levant) with a particular focus on Palestine. In contrast to travelers to Palestine, such as Arculf (c. 680s), Nasir Khusraw (c. 1040s) and others, who were pilgrims, al-Maqdisi gave detailed insights into the region's population, way of life, economy and climate. He paid special attention to Jerusalem, detailing its layout, walls, streets, markets, public structures and landmarks, particularly the Haram ash-Sharif (Temple Mount) and the latter's Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque. He described the city's people and customs, focusing on its Muslims, but also its Christian and Jewish communities, whose significant presence he lamented.\n\nAl-Maqdisi also gave extensive overviews of Ramla and Tiberias, the capitals of the Palestine and Jordan districts, respectively. To a lesser extent, he described Acre, Beisan, Bayt Jibrin, Caesarea, Amman and Aila. In his descriptions of the aforementioned cities, al-Maqdisi noted their prosperity and stability and gave a general impression of Palestine as densely populated and wealthy, with numerous localities.\n\nGuy Le Strange comments on al-Maqdisi's work: \n\nAl-Maqdisi mentioned regions in Eastern Arabia which form parts of what are now Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman. Al-Hasa is an important oasis region in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia, whereas Tuwwam is another oasis region split between the UAE and Oman, comprising the modern settlements of Al Ain and Al-Buraimi on different sides of the Omani-UAE border. Dibba is another region split between the UAE and Oman, touching the Musandam Peninsula, which is partly ruled by the Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, where the ancient settlement of Julfar is located.\n\n\n\n"}

At the 2006 census, its population was 227,547 in 59,388 families. Among the existing modern cities in Iran, Borujerd is one of the oldest reported at least since the 9th century. In Sassanid Empire, Borujerd was a small town and region neighboring Nahavand. Gaining more attention during Great Seljuq Empire in the 9th and 10th centuries, Borujerd stood as an industrial, commercial and strategic city in Zagros Mountains until the 20th century. In its golden ages, Borujerd was selected as the state capital of Lorestan and Khuzestan region during Qajar dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nToday, Borujerd is the second largest city of Lorestan; hence, the major industrial, tourist and cultural center of the region. The city has kept its old architecture and lifestyle mostly through mosques, bazaars and houses built in the Qajar era. Its people are mainly of Lurish descent, but there are a minority of Laks who also live in Borujrd and who are Laki speaking, like Balavand, Ghisavand, Shahivand, Bayrnavand, Ichivand, Kolivand, Jalilavand tribes who inhabit the area of Borujerd township. It called small Paris and Solomon's city.

The highest point is Garrin Mountain 3623 m above sea level and the lowest area is Gelerood River in South with 1400 m elevation. Borujerd Township has 2600 km area with approximately 400,000 inhabitants distributed in the city of Oshtorinan and more than 180 villages. Owing to favorable topographic and climatic conditions, the plains are devoted to cultivation of grain. Wherever irrigation is possible (by means of qanāts, wells, diversion of water of streams), cotton, melons, grapes, and fruit trees (especially almonds) are grown.\n\nBorujerd is located on Silakhor Plain which is the largest agricultural land of Lorestan. The high-elevated Zagros Mountains surrounds it from South East to North West and the peaks are covered with snow most of the times. Rural people work in farms or keep their domestic animals. Other people work in governmental offices, armed forces, factories or small local businesses. The feet of Zagros Mountains is a great destination for nomads and many Lurs and Bakhtiari nomads move there in summer. The area is paved with highways and is a crossroad between Tehran and Khuzestan Province as well as Isfahan Province and Kermanshah Province.\n\nBorujerd City has 256,962 inhabitants (estimated for 2006) and it is the 31st largest city in Iran and the 2nd largest in Lorestan . Borujerd is the industrial point of Lorestan. Its historical and cultural background as well as its remarkable nature, has changed it to a tourist destination. The city is well-structured with live nights and many shops and markets. Borujerdi people are easy going and tolerant and different religious minorities such as Jews, Sufism and Bahá'í Faith have grown there. The city has been named as Dār-Al-Sorur which means the house of happiness. Today, Borujerd is sometimes referred to as \"Paris Kučulu\" namely the little Paris.\nBorujerd population was estimated about 20000 in mid-1800s. Official statistics by \n\nThe city of Borujerd is one of the oldest cities in Iran which has been populated at least for 20 centuries and has been reported at least from Sassanid Empire. Though founded by the Jews having taken refuge to Persia, since the Muslim conquest of Persia (637-651), Borujerd has been considered as a strategic area and especially in Seljuq dynasty and Qajar dynasty it received significant attention and many mosques, schools, bridges and castles were made or rebuilt by these dynasties.\n\nThe Borujerd area has been populated at least since 3000 BC. Medes used its pastures to produce and train thousands of horses each year. However, it owes much of its development to the Jews which came to Persia after they had got close to extinction. Sassanid Empire promoted Borujerd to a city level and built a fire-temple there. During the Muslim conquest of Persia (637-651), Borujerd castle was used by Iranian army to support the troops and the final battle occurred in Nahavand, 55 km north West of Borujerd. Yazdegerd III escaped to Borujerd castle and his army reunited again there. The Islamic Arab governor, Abudolf ibn Hamulah, rebuilt the city and constructed the Jameh Mosque of Borujerd on top of a Zoroastrian fire temple.\n\nSeljuq rulers had many travels and battles in Borujerd and Barkiyaruq the sultan of Great Seljuk from 1094-1105 died in this city. Some references mention that Zavvarian 5 km N of Borujerd City is his tomb, however according to historical books, his body was returned to Isfahan.\n\nSince approximately 1000 to 1500, Borujerd Was governed by Atabakan-e Lorestan who governed Lur-e-Kuchak. Genghis Khan and Mongols attacked the Lur-e-Kuchak and ruined Borujerd and Khorramabad. Timur attacked Borujerd two times and destroyed this city but Timurids used Borujerd Castle and Roomian Castle for military purposes.\n\nIn Safavid era (1500-1700) Borujerd was governed as a separate state including Japlaq or Gapleh, and was neighbor of Golpayegan. Zand kings were Laks (Lurish descent) and originally from somewhere between Malayer and Borujerd. They paid attention to Borujerd for its brave soldiers (known as \"Silakhori\") which were already used by Safavids. Several battles occurred there.\n\nIn Qajar era Borujerd was a small state at first but changed to the centre of Lorestan Province and Khuzestan Province later and the city developed rapidly. The Soltani Mosque of Borujerd, the Great Bazaar of Borujerd and many schools and gardens were built and the city castle was rebuilt.\n\nReza Shah quit insurgencies of Lorestan and established army, railway, roads, hospitals and modern schools in Borujerd. In his time, Borujerd State was eliminated and according to new political dividing, Borujerd was attached to Lorestan Province.\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and during the Iran–Iraq War, Borujerd accepted many casualties and migrants from Khuzestan Province and was bombed many times. Sixty-five children were killed during bombings in an elementary school in Borujerd alone. In recent years, Borujerd has developed in population and construction and now it is struggling with social problems such as unemployment and drug abuse. 2006 Borujerd earthquake killed 66 people and injured 1400 people. It called small Paris and Solomon's city. It was a city that no people of Arabs choose that city because they are not familiar with them.\n\nThe people of Borujerd speak mostly the Borujerdi dialect, which is a distinctive dialect on the continuum between Lori and Farsi, though to high degree affected by the specific accent common among the Jewish population of Borujerd since their escape from Mesopotamia. Other speech varieties such as Luri, Laki, and the local Judæo-Iranian dialect can be heard as well. But Luri and Laki are not native language in that city.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The piece has Spanish motifs throughout, and launched a period when Spanish-themed music came into vogue. (Georges Bizet's opera \"Carmen\" premiered a month after the \"Symphonie espagnole\".)\n\nThe \"Symphonie espagnole\" is one of Lalo's two most often played works, the other being his Cello Concerto in D minor.\n\nThe piece has five movements:\n\nA typical performance runs just over half an hour. One of the shorter recordings, conductor Eugene Ormandy's 1967 recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra, featuring violinist Isaac Stern, runs 32 minutes and 43 seconds. It was common practice until the middle of the 20th century for performances of the work to omit the Intermezzo, leaving a four-movement work that more closely reflected the traditional structure of a symphony.\n\nThe \"Symphonie espagnole\" had some influence on the genesis of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D major. In March 1878, Tchaikovsky was staying at Nadezhda von Meck's estate at Clarens, Switzerland, while recovering from the breakdown of his disastrous marriage and his subsequent suicide attempt. His favourite pupil (and allegedly his lover), the violinist Iosif Kotek, shortly arrived from Berlin with a lot of new music for violin. His collection included the \"Symphonie espagnole\", which he and Tchaikovsky played through to great delight. This gave Tchaikovsky the idea of writing a violin concerto, and he immediately set aside his current work on a piano sonata and started on the concerto on 17 March. With Kotek's technical help, the concerto was finished by 11 April.\n\n"}

His account is still regarded with some concern as details, such as the distance between Newcastle upon Tyne and Otterburn, are incorrect.\n\nThe Scottish noble James, 2nd Earl of Douglas decided to lead a raid—one of a continuing series on both sides of the border—into English territory. It was timed to take advantage of divisions on the English side between Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland who had just taken over defence of the border.\n\nThe Scots divided their forces, with the main force and their baggage train heading towards Carlisle, while a raiding party under the Earl of Douglas ravaged the countryside around Durham and Newcastle. Northumberland sent his two sons Harry Hotspur and Sir Ralph Percy to engage while he stayed at Alnwick to cut off the marauders' retreat.\n\nFroissart says that the first fighting included a meeting of the Earl of Douglas and Henry Percy in hand-to-hand combat, in which Percy's pennon was captured. Douglas then moved off destroying the castle at Ponteland and besieging Otterburn Castle (now Otterburn Tower). Percy attacked Douglas's encampment with a surprise attack in the late afternoon, but first encountered the Earl's serving men, giving the bulk of the forces time to muster and attack them on their flank.\n\nDouglas led the left wing, while John Dunbar, Earl of Moray led the right. Hotspur's men, having ridden up from Newcastle, were tired and disorganized as they made their way onto the field. Hotspur was so overly confident that he attacked the Scots while the rest of his force was still marching up through Otterburn.\n\nDuring the battle on a moonlit night Douglas was killed; his death had no influence on the outcome of the battle and went unnoticed until much later. The Percys were both captured. Sir John Montgomery, 7th of Eaglesham captured Henry Percy (later using the ransom to build Polnoon Castle) with the remaining English force retreating to Newcastle. Despite Percy's force having an estimated three to one advantage over the Scots, Froissart records 1,040 English were captured and 1,860 killed whereas 200 Scots were captured and 100 were killed. \"The Westminster Chronicle\" estimates Scottish casualties at around 500. When the Bishop of Durham advanced from Newcastle with 10,000 men he was so impressed by the ordered appearance of the Scottish force, the din they set up with their horns, and their seemingly unassailable position, that he declined to attack.\n\nSome have suggested that Hotspur's rashness and eagerness to engage the Scots and the added tiredness of the English army after its long march north, were without doubt, the reasons for English defeat, despite having a three to one advantage in numbers. It is possible that the reasons for this defeat may be more complex, however.\n\nSuch a decisive victory kept the two sides apart for some time. Of such renown was the battle of Otterburn that several ballads were composed in its honour including \"The Battle of Otterburn\" and \"The Ballad of Chevy Chase\" (Child ballads 161 and 162). Chevy Chase rather mangles the history of the battle and may be confusing other conflicts at around the same time but it is still cited as one of the best of the ancient ballads.\n\nSome of the various Scottish Lowland families involved in this battle were the Clan Hall Swintons, Johnstones, Grahams, Gordons, Lindsays, Leslies, Herons, and Montgomerys.\n\n\n\n"}

The rotation is in addition to the forward or backward acceleration.\n\nKnowing of and understanding propeller walk is important when maneuvering in small spaces. It can be used to one's advantage while mooring off, or it can complicate a maneuver if the effect works against the pilot.\n\nA propeller is called right-handed if it rotates clockwise in forward gear (when viewed from the stern). A right-handed propeller in forward gear will tend to push the stern of the boat to starboard (thereby pushing the bow to port and turning the boat counter-clockwise) unless the rotation is corrected for. In reverse gear, the turning effect will be much stronger and with opposite direction (pushing the aft to port). A left-handed propeller acts analogically to the right-handed but with all rotation directions reversed.\n\nPropeller walk is caused by the water, moved by the propeller in an axial direction and in a rotation. The water, coming from the propeller, gets a cone shape, widening when it leaves the propeller. If the rotating water cone contacts the ship's hull, a sideways force is generated. Propeller walk is hardly noticeable when sailing forward, since the propeller water will not hit a large surface of the ship's hull and corrections to the ship's course can easily be made with the rudder. When in reverse gear, the water will hit the hull directly, resulting in propeller walk.\n\n\nDand. I.

The term is used to describe Bengalis from the east, who are marked by a distinct accent. . It is usually assumed that the Bramhaputra-Padma river system is the demarcation line between the Western and Eastern wings of the Bengal region. The areas to the East of the Bramhaputra-Padma river system are traditionally held to be the homeland of the Bangal people. However, some commentators claim that the areas of Sylhet division and Chattagram division should not be included as Bangal area but treated as distinct regions- harboring the Sylheti and Chatgaian people respectively. Going by the more strict definition, the Bangals are those people whose ancestry is connected to the Eastern Bengal plains of Mymensingh, Dhaka, and Comilla. Further, some opinions exist that among the East Bengal Plains origin people, only people belonging to the more affluent economic groups should be classified as Bangal. Going by this opinion, the designation Bangal has an ethno-geographic as well as a social connotation.\n\nSome of the people from East Bengal, mainly Hindus, migrated to West Bengal during the Partition of India in 1947. These refugees were sometimes referred to as Bangals by the native population of West Bengal. . As such, the terms Ghoti and Bangal are mostly used in West Bengal while in Bangladesh, the usage of these is rare except in regions with relatively high concentrations of immigrants from West Bengal. In modern times, amongst the high-caste Bengali Hindus, \"Bangal\" and \"Ghoti\" are used as social sub-groups. Those whose families came from East Bengal at the time of Partition are Bangals and those whose families were staying in West Bengal at that time are Ghotis. Similarly, the people who came to West Bengal from East Bengal before the Independence of India in1947 are also known as Ghotis as they were staying in West Bengal, India, at the time of Independence. The term as used here has little relation to actual geography since most members of these groups all now live in India. Historically, in addition to marrying within their castes, people from these groups also preferred to marry within the group, whether Bangal or Ghoti. . Bangals and Ghotis keep up their cultural rivalry through their respective support of the football clubs East Bengal (Bangals) and Mohun Bagan (Ghotis). They also cherish a rivalry through a claim of the supremacy of their respective cuisines and especially river-food delicacies, i. e., Chingri (prawn) for Ghotis and Ilish (hilsa) for Bangals. \n\n"}

While all Ghotis are ethno-linguistically Bengali, the term does not refer to a single community of people, and was initially not bound by religion. Instead, it is geographic in nature, loosely referring to all Bengali-speaking inhabitants of the western parts of the historic region of Bengal. \n\nIn history and popular culture, Western Bengal includes the land west of the Padma river (the tributary of the Ganges that flows eastwards), such as Jessore District and Khulna District in Bangladesh and almost the entirety of the state of West Bengal in India. Jessore and Khulna were Hindu-majority districts that were included in Pakistan during the partition of Bengal, while Muslim-majority Murshidabad was included in India to resolve border contiguity issues.\n\nThe usage of the term shot up since 1947 when India got its independence and the region of Bengal was bifurcated. The western half of Bengal, historic homeland of the Ghoti people, became the state of West Bengal, while the eastern half (Purbo Banga) became East Pakistan. In 1971, East Pakistan became the nation of Bangladesh after the Liberation of Bangladesh.\n\nDuring both events, as well as before and after them, millions of Hindu Bangals fled from East Pakistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution and political repression by the majority Muslim populace. These Bangal refugees competed for housing, food and employment as population density in West Bengal soared.\n\nThe term \"Ghoti\" was popularised by these refugees to identify the native population as well as the associated native culture, facets of which was significantly different from that in eastern Bengal. Subsequently, the native population, which was economically better placed and controlled the majority of the land and job resources, internalized the term. This arose from their desire and need to socially distinguish themselves from the newcomers, who were discriminated upon.\n\nAnother result of these massive religious migrations of the 20th century, necessitated by religious persecution on both sides of the border, have been the complete erasing of the \"Muslim Ghoti\". Some Bengali Muslims living in the Western parts of the region, left India for Bangladesh. After Bangladesh's independence, its founders espoused the national cultural identity of the country to be singularly bengali, without regional cultural allegiances. So, few Bangladeshi Muslims identify with their cultural Ghoti roots while those in West Bengal identify as either simply Muslims and/or Bengalis, culturally.\nThe terms \"Ghoti\" or \"Bangal\" now has little relation to actual geography, since most members of both groups live in India, mostly in West Bengal. The term is used freely and not considered derogatory within this social class now. The intrinsic differences between Ghotis and Bangals, and their rivalries are now part of the larger Culture of West Bengal. Millions of Bengalis in modern-day India, now have both Ghoti and Bangal heritage, with a high rate of intermarriage between the communities over the preceding four decades.\n\nThe dialects, folk traditions (\"Lokachaar\") and cuisine of Ghotis are distinct from those of the \"Purbabangiyas\" or the natives of erstwhile eastern Bengal.\n\nInitially, there was a protracted period of cultural and sociological clash between the native population and the refugees. Ghotis are frequently distinguished by their Bangla accent and use of certain local dialects and figures of speech that Bangals, in general, would not use. \n\nThe religious practices of Ghoti families differ significantly from other hindu families in the rest of the state. Ghotis perform Lakshmi puja (mostly only at home) on the day of Kali Puja. On the other hand, Bangals celebrate Lakshmi puja on the fifth day after Durga Puja.\n\nSweets are a major part of Ghoti cuisine, as is the case for the entire Bengal region. Sweets such as Sponge Rosogolla (Rasgulla), Misti doi, Ledikeni, Langcha, Jaynagarer Moa, Roshomalai, Pantua, JolBhora Talsash, Mihidana, Roshokadamba, Rajbhog and Gopalbhog, among others, are known to originate in Western Bengal and are a staple of Ghoti culture.\n\nIn terms of seafood, an important element of Bengali cuisine, Ghoti people are generally more associated with (Prawns), locally called 'Chingri', used to make a broad variety of Chingri malai curry. As compared to this, Bangals share a love for Hilsa fish, (popularly known as 'Ilish' in West Bengal).\n\nGhotis are also known for including a wide number of dishes with 'Posto'(Poppy seed) in their cuisine.\n\nMohun Bagan vs East Bengal : Traditionally, West Bengal has been a major centre for football and a longstanding rivalry between Ghoti and Bangal people on the football field have been a hallmark of the larger social friction between the groups.\n\nGhoti people have historically supported the Mohun Bagan AC whereas the Bangals are traditionally supporters of East Bengal Club. Though there are several exceptions, both communities in general have supported their respective teams since the 1950s. A popular culture mainstay in Kolkata, this deep rivalry has often resulted in violent clashes during matches, in the presence of thousands of fans.\n\nIn a typical season, the clubs currently meet at least 3 times a year; twice in the I-League and once in the Calcutta Football League. The ultimate showdown between the teams takes place during the annual Kolkata Derby, which features in FIFA's classic derby list.\n\nThe primary venue of the match - the 85,000-seat Salt Lake Stadium - has remained soldout on match day, for decades. The Kolkata Police Force has in recent years maintained strict supervision after riots between fans claimed lives on multiple occasions. Often the clubs also meet in other competitions like the Federation Cup (India), the IFA Shield, and the Durand Cup, among others.\n\n"}

However, after the television series was cancelled at the end of 1989, Virgin were granted the licence to produce full-length original novels continuing the story from the point at which the series had concluded.\n\nThe first range covered only the continuing adventures of the Seventh Doctor, but when that proved successful, Virgin also created this range covering the previous Doctors, with new stories that fit in between the televised serials.\n\nIn addition to original novels, the Missing Adventures series also incorporated two novelisations: \"The Ghosts of N-Space\", based upon a mid-1990s BBC audio play, and \"Downtime\", which was based upon an independent video production featuring several characters from the \"Doctor Who\" series (the novelisation is one of the few \"Doctor Who\" novels in which the Doctor does not appear as a central character).\n\nWhen the BBC decided in 1996 to do their own line of novels with the Eighth Doctor, they withdrew the license from Virgin to publish the Eighth Doctor Adventures. The adventures of the previous Doctors were taken up by the BBC in the Past Doctor Adventures line of books.\n\nIn 2014, both \"The Scales of Injustice\" and \"The Sands of Time\" were reprinted as part of BBC Books' \"The Monster Collection\". These were followed with \"The English Way of Death\", a part of \"The History Collection\" (2015).\n\nIncluding books featuring two of the Doctors, the total tallies are: First Doctor, 5 books; Second, 5 books; Third, 6 books; Fourth, 9 books; Fifth, 5 books; Sixth, 5 books; and Seventh, 1 book. \nThree of the \"Missing Adventures\" were sequels to televised serials, they were:\n\nTwo of the \"Missing Adventures\" were novelisations:\n\nMany \"Missing Adventures\" featured old foes, including:\n\nIn 1996, Virgin Books published \"Who Killed Kennedy\", a \"Doctor Who\" novel by David Bishop. Although set during the time of the Third Doctor, Virgin published this book as a standalone work, and not as part of the Missing Adventures series.\n\n"}
{"id": "1969007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969007", "title": "Percentage point", "text": "Percentage point\n\nA percentage point or percent point is the unit for the arithmetic difference of two percentages. For example, moving up from 40% to 44% is a 4 \"percentage point\" increase, but is a 10 percent increase in what is being measured. In the literature, the percentage point unit is usually either written out, or abbreviated as \"pp\" or \"p.p.\" to avoid ambiguity. After the first occurrence, some writers abbreviate by using just \"point\" or \"points\".\n\nConsider the following hypothetical example: In 1980, 50 percent of the population smoked, and in 1990 only 40 percent smoked. One can thus say that from 1980 to 1990, the prevalence of smoking decreased by 10 \"percentage points\" although smoking did not decrease by 10 percent (it decreased by \"20 percent\") – percentages indicate ratios, not differences.\n\nPercentage-point differences are one way to express a risk or probability. Consider a drug that cures a given disease in 70 percent of all cases, while without the drug, the disease heals spontaneously in only 50 percent of cases. The drug reduces absolute risk by 20 percentage points. Alternatives may be more meaningful to consumers of statistics, such as the reciprocal, also known as the number needed to treat (NNT). In this case, the reciprocal transform of the percentage-point difference would be 1/(20pp) = 1/0.20 = 5. Thus if 5 patients are treated with the drug, one could expect to heal one more case of the disease than would have occurred in the absence of the drug.\n\nFor measurements involving percentages as a unit, such as, growth, yield, or ejection fraction, statistical deviations and related descriptive statistics, including the standard deviation and root-mean-square error, the result should be expressed in units of percentage points instead of percentage. Mistakenly using percentage as the unit for the standard deviation is confusing, since percentage is also used as a unit for the relative standard deviation, i.e. standard deviation divided by average value (coefficient of variation).\n\n\n"}

He was the 2006 Green Party of New York candidate for governor in New York State, losing to the Democratic candidate Eliot Spitzer. He is the younger brother of author Frank McCourt.\n\nMcCourt was born in New York City, the son of Irish parents Angela (Sheehan) and Malachy McCourt. He is the last surviving child from among seven McCourt siblings, following the death of his younger brother Alphonsus in 2016. McCourt was raised in Limerick, Ireland, and returned to the United States in 1952. He has four children: Siobhan, Malachy III, Conor, and Cormac, the latter two by his second wife, Diana. He also has a stepdaughter, Nina. He was portrayed by Peter Halpin in the film version of his brother's memoir \"Angela's Ashes\". He is also one of the four founding members of the Manhattan Rugby Football Club in 1960. Malachy appears in Frank McCourt's novel \"'Tis\".\n\nHe has acted on stage, on television and in several movies, including \"The Molly Maguires\" (1970), \"The Brink's Job\" (1978), \"Q\" (1982), \"Brewster's Millions\" (1985), \"The January Man\" (1989), \"Beyond the Pale\" (2000), and \"Ash Wednesday\" (2002). He had appeared on three New York City-based soap operas: \"Ryan's Hope\", \"Search for Tomorrow\", and \"One Life to Live\". He is also known for his annual Christmas-time appearances on \"All My Children\" as Father Clarence, a priest who shows up to give inspirational advice to Pine Valley citizens.\n\nIn the 1970s he hosted a talk show on WMCA.\n\nIn 1970, McCourt released an album, \"And the Children Toll the Passing of the Day.\"\nIn recent years he has occasionally appeared on various programs on New York City's political radio station, WBAI. Among the shows on which he has appeared has been \"Radio Free Éireann\". He is also a regular guest artist at the Scranton Public Theatre in Pennsylvania, having performed in Inherit the Wind, Love Letters and A Couple of Blaguards which he co-wrote with brother Frank McCourt. Currently, Malachy has been hosting a call-in radio forum on WBAI, airing on Sunday mornings at 11 am. He also had a short-lived role as a Catholic priest on the HBO prison drama \"Oz\". He was the owner of Malachy's, a bar on Third Avenue in New York. One of his frequent patrons was actor, and friend, Richard Harris, who although famous worked for a short time behind the bar for McCourt. McCourt played Francis Preston Blair in \"Gods and Generals\" (2003).\n\nMcCourt also wrote two memoirs titled, respectively, \"A Monk Swimming\" and \"Singing My Him Song\", detailing his life in Ireland and later return to the United States where he operated a successful Manhattan tavern frequented by entertainment celebrities. He also authored a book on the history of the ballad Danny Boy. He also put together a collection of Irish writings, called 'Voices of Ireland'.\n\nOn Tuesday, 18 April 2006, McCourt announced that he would seek to become governor of New York in the November 2006 election as a Green Party candidate. Running under the slogan \"Don't waste your vote, give it to me\", McCourt promised to recall the New York National Guard from Iraq, to make public education free through college, and to institute a statewide comprehensive \"sickness care\" system. McCourt polled at 5% in a 10 October Zogby poll, versus 25% for Republican John Faso and 63% for Democrat Eliot Spitzer. McCourt was endorsed by Cindy Sheehan, mother of a fallen soldier in the Iraq War. The League of Women Voters excluded him from the gubernatorial debate. He came in a distant third in the general election, received 40,729 votes (or just under 1%), 9,271 votes short of what was required to gain automatic access in the 2010 election.\n\n\nA Monk Swimming (1998) is a memoir by Malachy McCourt of his life in Limerick, Ireland, and of his experiences when he came to America. The book recounts the journey and the many obstacles that McCourt had to overcome. After first working as a longshoreman, he was able to open a successful Manhattan tavern frequented by entertainment celebrities, and appeared on television talk shows, although neglecting his wife and child.\n\nThis memoir picks up roughly where Frank McCourt, the author's older brother, left off at the end of his Pulitzer Prize–winning \"Angela's Ashes\". This book was written and published before the elder McCourt published his own sequels, \"'Tis\" and \"Teacher Man\".\n\nMalachy McCourt's account of his early years in New York City and its surrounding areas lends a different, if not altogether more brusque, account of the McCourt Brothers respective returns to their native United States.\n\nSome notable sections include:\n\n\nThe title is a mondegreen of \"amongst women\", a phrase from the Catholic rosary prayer, Hail Mary.\n\nThe book is dedicated to New York City politician, humanitarian, and fellow Irishman Paul O'Dwyer, who at the time of first publication had recently died. McCourt and O'Dwyer had been close friends and politically like-minded.\n\n\n"}

The only three words heard in this track – \"desolation,\" \"creation,\" and \"communication\" – were similarly used (along with many other \"-ation\" words) in \"One More Time to Live.\"\n\nThe album reached #1 on the British album charts, in addition to a three-week stay at #2 in the United States, and produced one top-40 single, \"The Story in Your Eyes.\" The track \"Emily's Song\" was written by John Lodge for his newborn daughter.

He is more usually known as J. Edward Oliver or JEO, and to his friends he was just \"Jack\".\n\nHe originally achieved fame in the 1970s with a long-running strip in the UK music paper \"Disc (and Music Echo)\", later \"Record Mirror\". The strip had many fans including John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It included characters from TV, film and music, with a large section for readers' contributions (Win a Plastic Warthog). Jack provided other material, including a pop-based strip called The Nose, stories and numerous graphics.\n\nOne character proved particularly enduring, a dinosaur called Fresco-Le-Raye. Up to his death, J Edward Oliver continued to create Fresco strips which can be seen on his official website. (The site also features other strips, such as The Invisible Man, a staple of his \"Record Mirror\" years, with Young Julie, The Invisible Woman and more.)\n\nIn November 1977, the \"Record Mirror\" strip was deemed not contemporary enough and was ended. Oliver went to work for IPC Magazines Ltd, creating comic strips including \"Buster\"'s \"Master Mind\" (1980-1983), \"Cliff Hanger\" (1983-1987) and \"Vid Kid\", as well as drawing \"The Champ\" in \"Whizzer and Chips\" from 1979 to 1981. Many of his strips included puzzles and games.\nIn 1984, Oliver also wrote the words for a musical called \"Swan Esther\" which was performed at London's Young Vic and on BBC radio.\n\nWhen \"Buster\" ceased publication at the beginning of 2000, Oliver was the last artist left, and drew the only non-reprint material in the comic's final issue (\"How It All Ends\", which looked back at how all the Buster characters ended). With Buster gone, Oliver investigated other work, including newspaper strips and first day covers. In 2000, with his cousin [Steve Oliver], and together they created Phil Stamp Covers, unique first day covers for stamp collectors. Other work included promotional art for a single by Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs and UK records.\n\nAmong Oliver's trademarks in his strips were little signs reading \"Abolish Tuesdays\" and regular sightings of a tiny cube with a crank handle attached. The latter was never explained. Oliver also had something of an obsession with the British actress Madeline Smith, drawing several appearances by her into his work, which she later complained about. Oliver reacted characteristically, producing a strip about her complaint.\n\nIn 2000, a website about Oliver's work revived some interest in it. The site was originally created as a celebration of JEO's work in \"Disc\" and \"Record Mirror\" but later JEO contributed new material, as well as obscure historical stuff and a new, e-mailed (and free) weekly strip involving Fresco-Le-Raye, which eventually had hundreds of subscribers and ran for several hundred episodes, eventually developing from black-and-white to colour.\n\nIn 2007 Oliver announced he was suffering from cancer, but he continued to create new material. In March 2007 he married his girlfriend of many years, Liz Hales. He died peacefully on 26 May 2007.\n\nJEO's website continues, with much unpublished material finally seeing the light of day.\n\nA rare collection of early Middle Bronze Age (c. 13th century B.) tools and weapons was discovered by Oliver's father John whilst digging the footings of an extension to his home in Dartford, in 1986. The four implements comprised two axe-heads, a knife and a tanged shaving razor and are known as the Leyton Cross Bronzes. The items were purchased by and are on display in Dartford Museum.\n"}

His career-high singles ranking was world no. 26.\n\nHănescu attained a career-high singles ranking of No. 26 on 6 July 2009. In a Davis Cup match against the United States, he suffered a severe rib injury, and a subsequent injury sidelined him further in May 2006. By January 2007, his ranking had plummeted to No. 759, before he finally began making progress on a comeback.\n\nHănescu earned his first ATP singles ranking points in August 1999, with first-round wins two weeks in a row at the Romania F1 and F2 Futures tournaments. Although he played four more tournaments from September through December, he did not earn any additional points and finished the year ranked No. 1231.\n\nIn 2000, Hănescu played Satellites and Futures tournaments. His fourth-place finish at a Satellite in Croatia in April/May and third place at a Satellite in Portugal in October/November provided him with 36 of the 45 ATP singles ranking points he earned in 2000. He finished the year ranked No. 477.\n\nHănescu won his first pro tournaments in May 2001, taking the singles titles in consecutive weeks at the Slovakia F1 and F2 Futures events. A quarterfinal finish at a Challenger in Budapest two weeks later put him in the top 400 for the first time. In July, as the top seed in consecutive weeks in Bucharest, he reached the final at Romania F1 and won the F2 Futures event to improve his ranking to No. 319. In August in Challengers in three consecutive weeks, he reached the semifinals in Poland and Germany, and then the final in Germany to improve to No. 209. He broke into the top 200 for the first time in October, but went just 4–7 in Challengers after August and finished the year ranked No. 212.\n\nHănescu did not make much career progress in 2002. His highlights were reaching his first career ATP-level quarterfinal at Umag, Croatia in July, and then winning his first Challenger in Portugal in September. He finished the year ranked No. 172.\n\nModerate success in Challengers improved Hănescu's ranking to No. 150 by April 2003. He then qualified for the ATP tournament in Estoril and reached the third round of the Rome Masters in May and beat No. 31 Mikhail Youzhny, his highest-ranked win to that point. At the end of May, he qualified for the French Open and reached the third round, losing to Jarkko Nieminen, to break into the top 100 for the first time. He was a Lucky Loser entry at Wimbledon, and reached the third round there also, beating No. 34 Juan Ignacio Chela before losing to No. 12 Sjeng Schalken, improving his ranking to No. 85. He had limited success the rest of the year, losing in the first round at the US Open to No. 6 Lleyton Hewitt, before reaching the quarterfinals in Bucharest in September. In October, he qualified for his second Masters event of the year in Paris, upsetting No. 49 Rafael Nadal and No. 69 Anthony Dupuis, and then upsetting No. 27 Wayne Ferreira in the first round, before losing to No. 2 Andy Roddick. He finished the year ranked No. 70.\n\nHănescu played almost exclusively at the ATP level in 2004, but with very limited success. He was ranked high enough for direct entry into all four Grand Slams and the Olympics, but won only one match total in those five events. His successes were his first career ATP semifinal in Scottsdale in March, and several more ATP quarterfinals, including Bucharest again in September and Estoril in April, where he recorded his first win over a top-10 player, No. 6 Rainer Schüttler. In October, he went back down to the Challenger level and won in Rome, his second career Challenger title. He finished the year ranked No. 92, down 22 spots from 2003.\n\n2005 was Hănescu's best year to date. At the French Open, he beat Michal Tabara in the first round then No. 32 Juan Ignacio Chela in the second round, and then Luis Horna in the third round before he came back to beat No. 11 David Nalbandian in five sets 6–3, 4–6, 5–7, 6–1, 6–2, in the fourth round. He lost to No. 1 Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. He reached ATP semifinals in New Haven (beating No. 58 Nicolás Massú and No. 20 Tommy Robredo, before losing to No. 67 James Blake) and in Bucharest to reach the top 40 for the first time in September. He also had his second career win over a top-10 player, beating No. 10 Mariano Puerta in July, and finished the year with a career high ranking of No. 35.\n\nThe rib injury in the Davis Cup match and a subsequent back injury in May sidelined him for most of the year, and after starting the year out at No. 35, he finished up at No. 646. His lone success was winning the ATP-level exhibition tournament in Houston in April, beating Vince Spadea and Juan Mónaco.\n\nHis ranking continued to plummet due mainly to inactivity, as well as poor results when he did play, until March, when he qualified for a Challenger event in Italy and beat No. 126 Björn Phau to reach the second round. His protected ranking status gave him direct entry into a couple ATP events in April, with little success. So he continued to play Challengers, reaching a semifinal and a quarterfinal in May, and then a final in June to get back into the top 300. Finally in August, he won two consecutive Challengers in Romania and Austria to improve to No. 151 by the start of his home ATP stop in Bucharest in September, where he was a semifinalist in 2005; he went one step farther this time by making the finals, losing in three sets to Gilles Simon. It was his first career final.\n\nIn December, the ATP entered Hănescu into the \"2007 Centuries Club\" for advancing hundreds of spaces to regain a spot in the top 100 rankings. Hănescu climbed more ranking positions than any other player in the top 100. He finished the year at No. 77.\n\nHănescu reached the fourth round of the French Open, where he lost to Fernando González 2–6, 4–6, 2–6.

He reached the second round of the Australian Open, after defeating Jan Hernych, but then fell to Dudi Sela. Hănescu reached the second round in Zagreb. In Dubai, he lost his first-round match. In Miami, he lost to Michael Russell in the first round. Hănescu reached the quarterfinals in Casablanca.\nHe competed at the 2009 French Open. In the first round, he eliminated Steve Darcis 7–6, 7–6, 7–6, in the second round Mikhail Youzhny 7–5, 7–5, 7–5, and in the third round he upset seventh seed Gilles Simon 6–4, 6–4, 6–2. He next played Fernando González and lost 2–6, 4–6, 2–6.\n\nAt Wimbledon, he was seeded 31st. In the first round, he won a grueling match against Iván Navarro 6–3, 6–7, 6–4, 6–7, 12–10. Then he played Nicolas Devilder and won 6–2, 6–3, 6–1, to advance in the third round, where he lost to eighth-seeded Gilles Simon 2–6, 5–7, 2–6. At the 2009 MercedesCup, he reached the final by defeating Dominik Meffert, Rainer Schüttler, Alexandre Sidorenko, and Fabio Fognini in the semifinals. He lost in the final to Jérémy Chardy 6–1, 3–6, 4–6.\n\nAt the 2010 Australian Open, he won his first-round match against Juan Ignacio Chela 6–4, 6–3, 7–6, but then lost in the second round to World No. 1 Roger Federer 2–6, 3–6, 2–6.\n\nHe then played at the 2010 BNP Paribas Open, where he won his first-round match against Juan Ignacio Chela 6–3, 7–6, and then lost again to Roger Federer 3–6, 7–6, 1–6.\n\nAt the 2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia, he defeated Michael Berrer 6–2, 6–7, 6–3, in the first round, then Juan Mónaco 7–6, 6–4, to lose in the next round to eventual winner Rafael Nadal 3–6, 2–6.\n\nAt ATP Casablanca, April 5, 2010, he was runner up, losing in the final to Stanislas Wawrinka.\n\nHănescu reached the semifinals in Casablanca, losing there to Potito Starace, 1–6, 7–6, 6–7. He reached the final in Nice, where he lost to Nicolás Almagro, 6–7, 3–6, 3–6. He went out in the second round at the French Open and Wimbledon and had little success for the rest of the year.\n\nIn July, he broke an 11-match losing streak to beat then-world no. 7 and top seed Gaël Monfils at the MercedesCup, after saving two match points in the second-set tiebreaker.\n\nHănescu was defeated in the second round in Chennai by Canadian Milos Raonic, 1–6, 4–6. He also went out in the second round in São Paulo to Nicolás Almagro, who had beaten him in the final in Nice the previous year. He was defeated in the second round in Buenos Aires by upcoming Japanese star Kei Nishikori in three sets.\n\nHe reached the semifinals in Marrakech, going down against Slovak Martin Kližan, 5–7, 4–6. He reached the quarterfinals in Barletta, losing to Potito Starace, 5–7, 2–6.\n\nHe qualified in Monte Carlo and Madrid, but went out in the first round. He failed to qualify in Rome.\n\nAt the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Hănescu was booed and taunted by a group of spectators during his third-round loss to Daniel Brands of Germany. The group allegedly called him a gypsy, a highly derogatory term in Romania. Frustrated due to injury and crowd behaviour, he responded by spitting towards some spectators and received a warning from the umpire. He then deliberately made four service foot faults to lose two points, giving Brands a 3–0 lead in the final set, before retiring. Four spectators were later arrested by police under Section 5 of the Public Order Act. Hănescu was also fined US$15,000 for his behavior, this being the first of its kind in his career.\n\n\"Current through 2015 Wimbledon Championships.\n\"Current till US Open.\n"}

Muḥammad (Arabic ابن قدامة, \"Ibn Qudāmah\"; 1147 - 7 July 1223), often referred to as Ibn Qudamah or Ibn Qudama for short, was a Sunni Muslim ascetic, jurisconsult, traditionalist theologian, and religious mystic. Having authored many important treatises on jurisprudence and religious doctrine, including one of the standard works of Hanbali law, the revered \"al-Mug̲h̲nī\", Ibn Qudamah is highly regarded in Sunnism for being one of the most notable and influential thinkers of the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence. Within that school, he is one of the few thinkers to be given the honorific epithet of Shaykh of Islam, which is a prestigious title bestowed by Sunnis on some of the most important thinkers of their tradition. A proponent of the classical Sunni position of the \"differences between the scholars being a mercy,\" Ibn Qudamah is famous for having said: \"The consensus of the Imams of jurisprudence is an overwhelming proof and their disagreement is a vast mercy.\"\n\nIbn Qudamah was born in Palestine in Jammain, a town near Jerusalem (\"Bayt al-Maqdīs\" in the Arabic vernacular, whence his extended name), in 1147 to the revered Hanbali preacher and mystic Aḥmad b. Muḥammad b. Qudāmah (d. 1162), \"a man known for his asceticism\" and in whose honor \"a mosque was [later] built in Damascus.\" Having received the first phase of his education in Damascus, where he studied the Quran and the hadith extensively, Ibn Qudamah made his first trip to Baghdad in 1166, in order to study law and Sufi mysticism under the tutelage of the renowned Hanbali mystic and jurist Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. ca. 1167), who would go onto become one of the most widely venerated saints in all of Sunni Islam. Although Ibn Qudamah's \"discipleship was cut short by the latter’s death ... [the] experience [of studying under Abdul-Qadir Gilani] ... had its influence on the young\" scholar, \"who was to reserve a special place in his heart for mystics and mysticism\" for the rest of his life.\n\nIbn Qudamah's first stay in Baghdad lasted four years, during which time he is also said to have written an important work criticizing what he deemed to be the excessive rationalism of Ibn Aqil (d. 1119), entitled \"Taḥrīm al-naẓar fī kutub ahl al-kalām\" (\"The Censure of Rationalistic Theology\"). During this sojourn in Baghdad, Ibn Qudamah studied hadith under numerous teachers, including three female hadith masters, namely Khadīja al-Nahrawāniyya (d. 1175), Nafīsa al-Bazzāza (d. 1168), and Shuhda al-Kātiba (d. ca. 1175). In turn, all these various teachers gave Ibn Qudamah the permission to begin teaching the principles of hadith to his own students, including important female disciples such as Zaynab bint al-Wāsiṭī (d. ca. 1240). Ibn Qudamah fought in Saladins Army during the battle to recapture Jerusalem in 1187. He visited Baghdad again in 1189 and 1196, making his pilgrimage to Mecca the previous year in 1195, before finally settling down in Damascus in 1197, Ibn Qudamah died on Saturday, the Day of Eid al-Fitr, on July 7, 1223.\n\nIn theological creed, Ibn Qudamah was one of the primary proponents of the Athari school of Sunni theology, which held that overt theological speculation was spiritually detrimental and supported drawing theology exclusively from the two sources of the Quran and the hadith. Regarding theology, Ibn Qudamah famously said: \"We have no need to know the meaning of what God—Exalted is He—intended by His attributes—He is Great and Almighty. No deed is intended by them. No obligation is linked to them except belief in them. Belief in them is possible without knowing their meaning.\" According to one scholar, it is evident that Ibn Qudamah \"completely opposed discussion of theological matters and permitted no more than repeating what was said about God in the data of revelation.\" In other words, Ibn Qudamah rejected \"any attempt to link God’s attributes to the referential world of ordinary human language,\" which has led some scholars to describe Ibn Qudamah's theology as \"unreflective traditionalism,\" that is to say, as a theological point of view which purposefully avoided any type of speculation or reflection upon the nature of God. Ibn Qudamah's attitude towards theology was challenged by certain later Hanbali thinkers like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), who broke with this type of \"unreflective traditionalism\" in order to engage \"in [bold and unprecedented] interpretation[s] of the meanings of God’s attributes.\"\n\nIbn Qudamah seems to have been a formidable opponent of heresy in Islamic practice, as is evidenced by his famous words: \"There is nothing outside of Paradise but hell-fire; there is nothing outside of the truth but error; there is nothing outside of the Way of the Prophet but heretical innovation.\"\n\nIbn Qudamah appears to have been a supporter of seeking the intercession of Muhammad in personal prayer, for he approvingly cites the famous prayer attributed to Ibn Hanbal (d. 855): \"O God! I am turning to Thee with Thy Prophet, the Prophet of Mercy. O Muhammad! I am turning with you to my Lord for the fulfillment of my need.\" Ibn Qudama also relates that which al-’Utbiyy narrated concerning one's visitation to the grave of Muhammad in Medina: I was sitting by the grave of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when a bedouin man [\"a‘rābī\"] entered and said, “Peace be upon you, oh Messenger of God. I have heard God say [in the Qur’an], ‘Had they come to you [the Prophet] after having done injustice to themselves [sinned] and asked God for forgiveness and [additionally had] the Messenger asked for forgiveness on their behalf, they would have found God to be oft-turning [in repentance] and merciful.’ And I have come to you seeking forgiveness for my sin[s], and seeking your intercession near God.” He [the bedouin man] then said the following poem:\"O he who is the greatest of those buried in the grandest land, [Of] those whose scent has made the valley and hills fragrant, May my life be sacrificed for the grave that is your abode, Where chastity, generosity and nobility reside!\"Al-’Utbiyy then narrates that he fell asleep and saw the Prophet in a dream and was informed that the bedouin man had indeed been forgiven.After quoting the above event, Ibn Qudamah explicitly recommends that Muslims should use the above prayer when visiting the Prophet. He thus approves of asking the Prophet for his intercession even after his earthly death.\n\nAs is attested to by numerous sources, Ibn Qudamah was a devoted mystic and ascetic of the Qadiriyya order of Sufism, and reserved \"a special place in his heart for mystics and mysticism\" for the entirety of his life. Having inherited the \"spiritual mantle\" (\"k̲h̲irqa\") of Abdul-Qadir Gilani prior to the renowned spiritual master's death, Ibn Qudamah was formally invested with the authority to initiate his own disciples into the Qadiriyya tariqa. Ibn Qudamah later passed on the initiatic mantle to his cousin Ibrāhīm b. ʿAbd al-Wāḥid (d. 1217), another important Hanbali jurist, who became one of the primary Qadiriyya spiritual masters of the succeeding generation. According to some classical Sufi chains, another one of Ibn Qudamah's major disciples was his nephew Ibn Abī ʿUmar Qudāmah (d. 1283), who later bestowed the \"k̲h̲irqa\" upon Ibn Taymiyyah, who, as many recent academic studies have shown, actually appears to have been a devoted follower of the Qadiriyya Sufi order in his own right, despite his criticisms of several of the most widespread, orthodox Sufi practices of his day and, in particular, of the philosophical influence of the Akbari school of Ibn Arabi. Due to Ibn Qudamah's public support for the necessity of Sufism in orthodox Islamic practice, he gained a reputation for being one of \"the eminent Sufis\" of his era.\n\nIbn Qudamah supported using the relics of Muhammad for the deriving of holy blessings, as is evident from his approved citing, in \"al-Mug̲h̲nī\" 5:468, of the case of Abdullah ibn Umar (d. 693), whom he records as having placed \"his hand on the seat of the Prophet's \"minbar\" ... [and] then [having proceeded to] wipe his face with it.\" This view was not novel or even unusual in any sense,\nas Ibn Qudamah would have found established support for the use of relics in the Quran, hadith, and in Ibn Hanbal's well-documented love for the veneration of Muhammad's relics.\n\nIbn Qudamah staunchly criticized all who questioned or rejected the existence of saints, the veneration of whom had become an integral part of Sunni piety by the time period and which he \"roundly endorsed.\" As scholars have noted, Hanbali authors of the period were \"united in their affirmation of sainthood and saintly miracles,\" and Ibn Qudamah was no exception. Thus, Ibn Qudamah vehemently criticized what he perceived to be the rationalizing tendencies of Ibn Aqil for his attack against the veneration of saints, saying: \"As for the people of the Sunna who follow the traditions and pursue the path of the righteous ancestors, no imperfection taints them, not does any disgrace occur to them. Among them are the learned who practise their knowledge, the saints and the righteous men, the God-fearing and pious, the pure and the good, those who have attained the state of sainthood and the performance of miracles, and those who worship in humility and exert themselves in the study of religious law. It is with their praise that books and registers are adorned. Their annals embellish the congregations and assemblies. Hearts become alive at the mention of their life histories, and happiness ensues from following their footsteps. They are supported by religion; and religion is by them endorsed. Of them the Quran speaks; and the Quran they themselves express. And they are a refuge to men when events afflict them: for kings, and others of lesser rank, seek their visits, regarding their supplications to God as a means of obtaining blessings, and asking them to intercede for them with God.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969052", "title": "Resolute desk", "text": "Resolute desk\n\nThe \"Resolute\" desk is a nineteenth-century partners' desk used by several presidents of the United States in the White House Oval Office as the Oval Office desk. It was a gift from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 and was built from the English oak timbers of the British Arctic exploration ship . Franklin Roosevelt requested the addition of a door with the presidential seal to conceal his leg braces. Many presidents since Hayes have used the desk at various locations in the White House.\n\nThe desk was removed from the White House after the tragic 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, when President Lyndon Johnson allowed it to go on a traveling exhibition with other artifacts of the Kennedy Presidential Library. It was then put on display in the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter brought the desk back to the Oval Office in 1977, where it has remained with every president since, except George H. W. Bush, who used the C&O desk in the Oval Office (also keeping the \"Resolute\" desk in the White House).\n\nThe original design plan and elevation for the \"President's Desk\" were created on September 9, 1879. They are now kept by the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England, and can be viewed online.\n\nThe National Maritime Museum's September 9, 1879, design plans are drawings for two different gifts proposed by the Admiralty but never executed, a \"Secretaire\" and a \"Library Table\". The library table and the President's secretaire were never implemented and these proposed gifts were replaced with William Evenden's 1880 \"Resolute\" desk. The Evenden desk delivered to President Hayes does not accord with the plan held at Greenwich except for the order imperative that it \"be made from the timbers of the late Arctic Ship \"Resolute\"\".\n\nThe design plan for the desk provided for ornate features to be incorporated into the proposed Library Table were tabulated on the September 9, 1879, Design Plans under the caption \"References\" as follows:\n\nAn image of the desk purporting to be the gift delivered to President Hayes appeared as a steel engraving in the December 11, 1880, issue of \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\", New York, captioned: \"Secretaire Made From the Timbers of the British Arctic Ship \"Resolute\" and Presented by Queen Victoria to the President of the United States\". Beneath the half page image is a related article, which describes the desk inaccurately:\n\nThe image and the written description in the newspaper article are not of the Evenden President's Desk delivered on November 23, 1880, but depicts the desk in the Admiralty's September 9, 1879, design plan for the library table.\n\nA plate on the front of the desk presented to President Hayes bears the following inscription:\n\nPlaques with similar messages were fitted onto each desk made, the \"Resolute\" desk in the White House, Queen Victoria's writing table, and the Grinnell desk.\n\nThe desk has been modified twice. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a hinged front panel for the knee hole opening in order to hide his leg braces. The panel features the presidential seal—one of only three of the ninety-seven in the White House that have the eagle's head turned towards the 13 arrows in the eagle's left talon, as opposed to the now-official arrangement with the eagle turned towards the olive branch in the right talon with the 13 leaves.\n\nThe second modification was done to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. The first time a base was made for the \"Resolute\" desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. It was made of pine and did not match the desk well. It is very visible in a photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under the desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent back to the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. Photos from January–February 1977 show the \"Resolute\" desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs on the top of the knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for the desk in 1986, and has remained with the desk since that time.\n\n was part of a five-ship squadron under Edward Belcher sent from Britain in April 1852 to search for the missing British explorer Sir John Franklin, who had left Britain in 1845 in search of the fabled Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic. The Western Division of the squadron, consisting of HMS \"Resolute\" and HMS \"Intrepid\" under Captain Kellett's command, sailed West and wintered at Deally Island off Melville Island. The Eastern Division, consisting of HMS \"Assistance\" and \"Pioneer\" under Sir Edward Belcher's command, sailed North up the Wellington Channel and wintered near Northumberland Sound. The men spent the autumn of 1852, and the spring and summer of 1853 sledging across the Arctic in search of the Franklin Expedition, as well as the men on HMS \"Investigator\" (Captain Robert McClure), and HMS \"Enterprise\" (Captain Richard Collinson). After finding and rescuing McClure and the crew of \"Investigator\", \"Resolute\" and \"Intrepid\" sailed east, but had to winter in the pack ice, gradually moving East all winter. Belcher's two ships moved south in the Wellington Channel before being frozen in again near Disaster Bay. In the spring of 1854 Belcher ordered the abandonment of four of his five ships, and the men gathered at Beechey Island. By the time they were ready to leave, both \"Assistance\" and \"Pioneer\" had broken free and had traveled 45 miles South in the Wellington Channel until they were only a few miles from Beechey Island. This made no difference to Belcher who was simply desperate to go home. Since he had made his two ships \"hells afloat\" as he always did, his men were also desperate to leave. However, Kellett only abandoned \"Resolute\" and \"Intrepid\" under protest. The officers and men returned home on HMS \"North Star\" and the relief ships HMS \"Phoenix\" and HMS \"Talbot\".\n\nAs a matter of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by courts-martial. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four seaworthy vessels, as were \"Resolute\"'s captain, Henry Kellett; \"Intrepid\" 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and \"Pioneer\" 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his court-martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. \"Resolute\" continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw \"Resolute\" adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, \"George Henry,\" had preceded \"Resolute\", and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.\n\nAt the time of the salvage in 1855, Britain and America had several areas of active dispute: Britain's territorial claims in Belize, which the United States claimed violated the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty and disputes over fishing rights and the border between British Columbia and Washington Territory. In March 1855, an armed action by Washington Territory officials in the San Juan Islands had raised tensions between the countries. After the \"Resolute\" was recovered, Senator James Murray Mason, from Virginia, proposed a bill in Congress for the federal government to buy \"Resolute\", refurbish her, and sail her back to Britain as a present. The bill passed, authorizing more than $40,000 for the work, and President Franklin Pierce signed it into law.\n\n\"Resolute\" was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she underwent a complete refit, and Commander Henry Hartstene USN, sailed her back to Britain, arriving at Spithead on December 12, 1856. After \"Resolute\" was towed to Cowes so that the Queen and Prince Albert could tour her, Captain Harstene presented the ship to Queen Victoria as a gesture of peace and good-will on December 17, 1856.\n\nSoon the talk of imminent war ceased, and the gift of \"Resolute\" was seen as instrumental in the easing of these tensions. In 1856, the United States and Britain appointed boundary commissioners to resolve the San Juan Island dispute. The disputes, however, would continue to flare until the 1860s, with conflict in the Pig War (1859) in the San Juan Islands, and the First Lord of the Admiralty warning that \"drifting into war\" was still possible in Central America until the Central American treaties of 1859-1860.\n\nHenry Grinnell, a New York merchant with an interest in the fate of Franklin's lost expedition, had supported the gifting of \"Resolute\", and along with Lady Franklin had hoped the British would use the ship for a new search for those lost. However, by 1856 the Royal Navy doubted that any of Franklin's men could still be alive eleven years after they entered the Arctic, and declined to support a new search. Nor was the Navy willing to let Lady Franklin use \"Resolute\" for a privately funded search. Britain could not risk losing \"Resolute\" after the important role the ship had played in smoothing the relationship between her and America. \"Resolute\" stayed in home waters until she was taken to the breaker's dock at Chatham Dockyard in 1879.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy first placed the \"Resolute\" desk in the Oval Office in 1961. The desk left the White House from 1963 until President Carter brought it back to the Oval Office. Since then, presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have used it in the Oval Office. Some presidents, such as George H. W. Bush, have used the desk in their private study rather than in the Oval Office.\n\nWhen president Lyndon B. Johnson took office in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and mistakenly believed to be that of former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the \"Resolute\" desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the C&O desk that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the \"Resolute\" desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.\n\nIn 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited President Barack Obama and gave him the original framed commissioning papers for \"Resolute\" and an ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of HMS \"Gannet\". \n\nAfter \"Resolute\" was broken up, Queen Victoria asked for several desks to be built from her timbers. Four desks were designed and made by William Evenden. A large partners desk was presented to President Rutherford B. Hayes on November 23, 1880, while a smaller lady's desk was presented to the widow of Henry Grinnell; this desk is now in the New Bedford Whaling Museum. Finally, the Queen had two desks made for herself: one is a small writing table cataloged online (with a photograph showing its plaque) . The second is a smaller writing table which she had made for her private yacht, HMY \"Victoria and Albert II\". The National Museum of the Royal Navy lent the item for a short exhibition; however, the table was returned to the Royal Collection after the loan period ended in 2008.\n\nThere are exact replicas of the \"Resolute\" desk on display in at least six presidential libraries. The desk at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library was recreated by Robert Whitley. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California; the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California; the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio; and the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, include replicas of the \"Resolute\" desk. The desks at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the George and Barbara Bush Center at the University of New England, Maine were produced by the History Company of Ithaca, New York. A video clip of the desk in production can be viewed at \"History Company\".\n\nA few independent museums also display replicas, including The Presidents Hall of Fame in Clermont, Florida, The Quality West Wing Foundation Museum in Corona, California, a children's educational program focusing on U.S. government, history, and the Presidency; along with the educational program there is a replica of the Oval Office available by appointment; the Treehouse Children's Museum, in Ogden, Utah, which features a small-scale Oval Office; and a full-scale replica of the Oval Office open to the public at the American Village in Montevallo, Alabama.\n\nReplicas of the \"Resolute\" desk have appeared in many movies. The desk was a key plot device in \"\", in which a secret compartment in the desk contained pieces of a clue to the location of treasure. The film also features another desk made from HMS \"Resolute,\" situated in Buckingham Palace, which was made for the personal use of Queen Victoria.\n\nRadio and television host Mark Levin commissioned an exact copy of the desk as the centerpiece for his stage set on Conservative Review.\n\nSeveral companies offer replicas for sale.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1969054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969054", "title": "Temple of Vesta", "text": "Temple of Vesta\n\nThe Temple of Vesta, or the aedes (Latin \"Aedes Vestae\"; Italian: \"Tempio di Vesta\"), is an ancient edifice in Rome, Italy. The temple is located in the Roman Forum near the Regia and the House of the Vestal Virgins. The Temple of Vesta housed Vesta's holy fire which was a symbol of Rome's safety and prosperity. The temple's most recognizable feature is its circular footprint. Since the worship of Vesta began in private homes, the architecture seems to pay homage to the architecture of early Roman homes. The temple used Greek architecture with Corinthian columns, marble, and had a central cella. The surviving structure indicates that there were twenty Corinthian columns built on a podium fifteen meters in diameter. The roof probably had a vent at the apex to allow smoke to release.\n\nThe Temple of Vesta was first built by Numa Pompilius. Numa Pompilius was Rome's second king. During his time in power he also built the original Regia and House of the Vestal Virgins and founded the order of the Vestals. Vesta was the patron goddess of the domestic hearth. In honour of Vesta, the Vestals would grow sacred grain to burn in the sacred hearth of the temple. The Romans believed that the Sacred fire of Vesta was closely tied to the fortunes of the city. They believed that the extinction of the fire would lead to disaster falling on Rome.\n\nThe Temple of Vesta was tended by the Vestal Virgins. The Vestal Virgins were freeborn, aristocratic women who had been sworn to celibacy in their service to Vesta. The Vestal oath of lifelong virginity was what set them apart from other Romans. While chastity until marriage was supported in Rome, lifelong celibacy was not typical as women were generally expected to give birth to heirs for their husbands. Should a Vestal virgin become unchaste it was seen as a disruption between Rome and its gods. The Romans believed that such a disconnect between its gods would lead to pestilence, tragedy, or military defeats. The Vestals were also bound to serve the goddess Vesta and tended to the Sacred Fire of Vesta from childhood until maturity. A Vestal Virgin had a tenure that typically lasted from the age of 6 to 36 years at which point a Vestal virgin had the ability to leave the priesthood and marry. Most women chose to remain within the priesthood after their tenure ended. This choice to remain in the priesthood may have been a result of the respect and social privileges that came from their position. Most chose to spend their entire lives as a priestess.\n\nThe Vestal Virgins were bound by strict rules and harsh punishments. For minor misdeeds the Vestals were subject to being whipped with rods. For more serious offences, such as having sexual relations or allowing the sacred fire to go out, the Vestals were sentenced to being interred in a subterranean cell and left to die with little food or water. Vestal Virgins could also be punished if something bad happened to Rome. If a Vestal Virgin broke her oath of celibacy, Rome's connection to the gods was considered broken, which resulted in Rome being punished by the gods. The belief that a Vestal's purity was connected to Rome' s fate caused some Vestal Virgins to be accused of breaking their oaths a punished for when tragedy struck Rome. One such example took place in 114 BC, when Helvia, the Virgin daughter of L. Helvius, was killed by lightning. Helvia's death was interpreted as a sign that there was trouble in the Temple of Vesta. Three Vestal Virgins were sentenced to death for breaking their oath and being unchaste. The Vestal Virgins were closely watched and harshly punished when they broke their oaths, or suspected of breaking their oaths. However, respect and social privileges that came from their position encouraged many to remain in the priesthood.\n\nThe temple of Vesta was unique in its design as it was round while many of the other temples were rectangular. The circular shape of the Vesta temples were based off of the primitive round hut. Some researchers argue that the circular footprint of the Temple of Vesta was meant to symbolize the earth and the domed roof symbolized the heavens. All temples to Vesta were round, and had entrances facing east to enhance the connection between Vesta’s fire and the sun as sources of life. The Temple of Vesta represents the site of ancient religious activity as far back as 7th century BCE.\n\nArchaeologists have found that the Temple of Vesta was built on a circular foundation. Circling the exterior of the temple were twenty fluted columns. Each column was 0.52 meters in diameter with a base 1.6 meters in circumference. The columns were topped with a Corinthian capital . The radius of the temple was about 6.19 meters. This measured from the outer line of the architrave to the middle of the temple. The interior wall is 0.60 meters thick and the diameter of the inside of the temple is 8.6 meters. The Temple was on a high platform and wide steps lead up to the entrance.\n\nIt was one of the earliest structures located in the Roman Forum although its final reincarnation was the result of subsequent rebuilding. Instead of a cult statue in the \"cella\", there was a hearth which held the sacred flame. The temple was the storehouse for the legal wills and documents of Roman Senators and cult objects such as the Palladium. The Palladium was a statue of Athena (Roman Minerva) believed to have been brought by Aeneas from Troy; the statue was felt to be one of the Pignora Imperii, or pledges of imperium, of Ancient Rome. The temple was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire in the 4th-century. The Temple of Vesta, the Atrium of the Vestal Virgins (House of the Vestal Virgins), and the Regia are the earliest evidence of the Cult of Vesta. The original Temple of Vesta stood on the east end of the forum near the house of the Vestal Virgins and the Regia. Beyond that cluster of buildings is the Via Sacra (Sacred Way) which ran uphill. This cluster of buildings was destroyed in the fire of Nero. In 575 BC the temple was rebuilt in its current location.\nThe temple was rebuilt many times because it was for it was also destroyed many times. The first destruction of the temple was by the Gauls in 390 BC. Livy records that after the Gauls burned down the temple they soon returned to find that the Vestals had rekindled their sacred fire among the ruins of the temple. According to Ovid, the second destruction in 241 BC may have started because of the fire in the temple itself. During the fire, the Vestals were unable to collect the cult objects, and they were destroyed along with the Temple of Vesta. Lucius Caecilius Metellus, the Pontifex Maximus at the time, went into the burning temple to save the palladium. Lucius Caecilius was blinded by the flames and it was believed that this was the result of him breaking the tradition of the temple which barres men from entering. Fires also occurred again in 210 BC and again in the early first century BC. The temple was rebuilt again during the reigns of Augustus and Nero. Finally, it burned down in 191 AD and was rebuilt for the last time during the reign of Septimius Severus.\n\nThe Temple of Vesta remained reasonably intact until the Renaissance. However, in 1549 AD, the temple was demolished and its marble was repurposed to build churches and papal palaces. Most of our knowledge about what the original Temple of Vesta looked like come from its depictions on coins and art. One piece of art that depicts the Temple of Vesta is a marble relief in the Uffizi in Florence Italy. These depictions and others like it allow us to understand what the temple looked like in antiquity.\n\nModern archaeological investigation began on the site of the Temple of Vesta in the late nineteenth century. The exploration began in 1877 with archaeologist R. Lanciani's excavation of the Temple of Vesta and the publishing his findings. During his exploration he was able to uncover many parts of the Temple of Vesta including parts of the entablature and ceiling. Exploration continued from 1898 to 1900 when Giaccomo Boni, director of the Roman Forum, embarking on a new round of excavations. His works were published in 1900 and included measurements and sections of the temple's foundation, photos and drawings of the principle architectural elements, and a restored plan of the building. Finally, in 1930-1931 Alfonso Bartoli reconstructed two and a half of the Temple of Vesta's bays which can still be seen in the forum today.\n\n\n\n"}

Her outstanding performance in her first leading role in movie Abnormal Beauty Abnormal Beauty won her a nomination for the Best New Actor in the 24th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards (2005) and the 42nd Golden Horse Film Awards' (2005) in Taiwan. Race Wong continued to experiment with different roles both on-screen and off-screen. In 2006, together with her sister Rosanne Wong, they took on groundbreaking leading roles in a musical adaption of The Smiling Proud Wanderer stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company (2006) where Rosanne famously shaved bald for the role. The musical enjoyed a success which brought them to perform in Shanghai the following year.\n\nLater in 2008, Race Wong's starring role as a pregnant new immigrant from China was a break away from her usual youthful image in the movie True Women for Sale which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards (2009). Race is one of the very rare few Singaporeans to have been nominated in the Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\nIn 2010, Race Wong decided to step out of the limelight for a break. She took on a Masters of Business course to further her education and graduated with a Masters of Business majoring in Marketing from the University of Newcastle (Australia) in 2013. Concurrently in 2011, she made an unexpected career change into finance, taking on the role of Marketing Manager at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Hong Kong). She was licensed with the Securities and Futures Commission to conduct equities trading.\n\nThe year she turned 30, Race Wong made a surprising move to relocate back to Singapore where her family is based. Together with her younger sister Rhonda Wong, she set up Anthill Realtors Pte. Ltd. in 2013 a real estate agency licensed with CEA. She then co-founded Ohmyhome Pte Ltd in 2015, a tech company focused on connecting buyers to sellers, landlords to tenants in real estate. When asked about her career move, Race said that she wanted to focus her attention on something that will provide more value to people, something on the opposite spectrum of her celebrity lifestyle.\n\nShe speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin, and English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards\n\n"}
{"id": "1969072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969072", "title": "IP traceback", "text": "IP traceback\n\nIP traceback is any method for reliably determining the origin of a packet on the Internet. The IP protocol does not provide for the authentication of the source IP address of an IP packet, enabling the source address to be falsified in a strategy called IP address spoofing, and creating potential internet security and stability problems.\n\nUse of false source IP addresses allows denial-of-service attacks (DoS) or one-way attacks (where the response from the victim host is so well known that return packets need not be received to continue the attack). IP traceback is critical for identifying sources of attacks and instituting protection measures for the Internet. Most existing approaches to this problem have been tailored toward DoS attack detection. Such solutions require high numbers of packets to converge on the attack path(s).\n\nSavage et al. suggested probabilistically marking packets as they traverse routers through the Internet. They propose that the router mark the packet with either the router’s IP address or the edges of the path that the packet traversed to reach the router.\n\nFor the first alternative, marking packets with the router's IP address, analysis shows that in order to gain the correct attack path with 95% accuracy as many as 294,000 packets are required. The second approach, edge marking, requires that the two nodes that make up an edge mark the path with their IP addresses along with the distance between them. This approach would require more state information in each packet than simple node marking but would converge much faster. They suggest three ways to reduce the state information of these approaches into something more manageable.\n\nThe first approach is to XOR each node forming an edge in the path with each other. Node \"a\" inserts its IP address into the packet and sends it to \"b\". Upon being detected at \"b\" (by detecting a 0 in the distance), \"b\" XORs its address with the address of \"a\". This new data entity is called an edge id and reduces the required state for edge sampling by half.\nTheir next approach is to further take this edge id and fragment it into \"k\" smaller fragments. Then, randomly select a fragment and encode it, along with the fragment offset so that the correct corresponding fragment is selected from a downstream router for processing.\nWhen enough packets are received, the victim can reconstruct all of the edges the series of packets traversed (even in the presence of multiple attackers).\n\nDue to the high number of combinations required to rebuild a fragmented edge id, the reconstruction of such an attack graph is computationally intensive according to research by Song and Perrig. Furthermore, the approach results in a large number of false positives. As an example, with only 25 attacking hosts in a DDoS attack the reconstruction process takes days to build and results in thousands of false positives.\n\nAccordingly, Song and Perrig propose the following traceback scheme: instead of encoding the IP address interleaved with a hash, they suggest encoding the IP address into an 11 bit hash and maintain a 5 bit hop count, both stored in the 16-bit fragment ID field. This is based on the observation that a 5-bit hop count (32 max hops) is sufficient for almost all Internet routes. Further, they suggest that two different hashing functions be used so that the order of the routers in the markings can be determined. Next, if any given hop decides to mark it first checks the distance field for a 0, which implies that a previous router has already marked it. If this is the case, it generates an 11-bit hash of its own IP address and then XORs it with the previous hop. If it finds a non-zero hop count it inserts its IP hash, sets the hop count to zero and forwards the packet on. If a router decides not to mark the packet it merely increments the hop count in the overloaded fragment id field.\n\nSong and Perrig identify that this is not robust enough against collisions and thus suggest using a set of independent hash functions, randomly selecting one, and then hashing the IP along with a FID or function id and then encoding this. They state that this approach essentially reduces the probability of collision to (1/(211)m). For further details see Song and Perrig.\n\nBelenky and Ansari, outline a deterministic packet marking scheme. They describe a more realistic topology for the Internet – that is composed of LANs and ASs with a connective boundary – and attempt to put a single mark on inbound packets at the point of network ingress. Their idea is to put, with random probability of .5, the upper or lower half of the IP address of the ingress interface into the fragment id field of the packet, and then set a reserve bit indicating which portion of the address is contained in the fragment field. By using this approach they claim to be able to obtain 0 false positives with .99 probability after only 7 packets.\n\nRayanchu and Barua provide another spin on this approach (called DERM). Their approach is similar in that they wish to use and encoded IP address of the input interface in the fragment id field of the packet. Where they differ from Belenky and Ansari is that they wish to encode the IP address as a 16-bit hash of that IP address. Initially they choose a known hashing function. They state that there would be some collisions if there were greater than 2^16 edge routers doing the marking.\n\nThey attempt to mitigate the collision problem by introducing a random distributed selection of a hash function from the universal set, and then applying it to the IP address. In either hashing scenario, the source address and the hash are mapped together in a table for later look-up along with a bit indicating which portion of the address they have received. Through a complicated procedure and a random hash selection, they are capable of reducing address collision. By using a deterministic approach they reduce the time for their reconstruction procedure for their mark (the 16-bit hash). However, by encoding that mark through hashing they introduce the probability of collisions, and thus false-positives.\n\nShokri and Varshovi introduced the concepts of Dynamic Marking and Mark-based Detection with \"Dynamic Deterministic Packet Marking,\" (DDPM). In dynamic marking it is possible to find the attack agents in a large scale DDoS network. In the case of a DRDoS it enables the victim to trace the attack one step further back to the source, to find a master machine or the real attacker with only a few numbers of packets. The proposed marking procedure increases the possibility of DRDoS attack detection at the victim through mark-based detection. In the mark-based method, the detection engine takes into account the marks of the packets to identify varying sources of a single site involved in a DDoS attack. This significantly increases the probability of detection. In order to satisfy the end-to-end arguments approach, fate-sharing and also respect to the need for scalable and applicable schemes, only edge routers implement a simple marking procedure. The fairly negligible amount of delay and bandwidth overhead added to the edge routers make the DDPM implementable.\n\nS. Majumdar, D. Kulkarni and C. Ravishankar proposes a new method to traceback the origin of DHCP packets in ICDCN 2011. Their method adds a new DHCP option that contains the MAC address and the ingress port of the edge switch which had received the DHCP packet. This new option will be added to the DHCP packet by the edge switch. This solution follows DHCP RFCs. Previous IP traceback mechanisms have overloaded IP header fields with traceback information and thus are violating IP RFCs. Like other mechanisms, this paper also assumes that the network is trusted. The paper presents various performance issues in routers/switches that were considered while designing this practical approach. However, this approach is not applicable to any general IP packet.\nWith router-based approaches, the router is charged with maintaining information regarding packets that pass through it. For example, Sager proposes to log packets and then data mine them later. This has the benefit of being out of band and thus not hindering the fast path.\n\nSnoeren et al. propose marking within the router. The idea proposed in their paper is to generate a fingerprint of the packet, based upon the invariant portions of the packet (source, destination, etc.) and the first 8 bytes of payload (which is unique enough to have a low probability of collision). More specifically, m independent simple hash functions each generate an output in the range of 2n-1. A bit is then set at the index generated to create a fingerprint when combined with the output of all other hash functions. All fingerprints are stored in a 2n bit table for later retrieval. The paper shows a simple family of hash functions suitable for this purpose and present a hardware implementation of it.\n\nThe space needed at each router is limited and controllable (2n bits). A small \"n\" makes the probability of collision of packet hashes (and false identification) higher. When a packet is to be traced back, it is forwarded to originating routers where fingerprint matches are checked. As time passes, the fingerprint information is “clobbered” by hashes generated by other packets. Thus, the selectivity of this approach degrades with the time that has passed between the passage of the packet and the traceback interrogation.\n\nAnother known take on the router-based schemes comes from Hazeyama et al. In their approach, they wish to integrate the SPIE approach as outlined by Snoeren, with their approach of recording the layer 2 link-id along with the network ID (VLAN or true ID), the MAC address of the layer 2 switch that received the packet and the link id it came in on. This information is then put into two look-up tables – both containing the switch (layer 2 router) MAC id for look-up. They rely on the MAC:port tuple as a method of tracing a packet back (even if the MAC address has been spoofed).\n\nTo help mitigate the problem of storage limitations they use Snoeren’s hashing approach and implementation (SPIE) – modifying it to accept their information for hashing. They admit their algorithm is slow (O(N2)) and with only 3.3 million packet hashes being stored the approximate time before the digest tables are invalid is 1 minute. This dictates that any attack response must be real-time – a possibility only on single-administrative LAN domains.\n\nThe ICMP traceback scheme Steven M. Bellovin proposes probabilistically sending an ICMP traceback packet forward to the destination host of an IP packet with some low probability. Thus, the need to maintain state in either the packet or the router is obviated. Furthermore, the low probability keeps the processing overhead as well as the bandwidth requirement low. Bellovin suggests that the selection also be based on pseudo-random numbers to help block attempts to time attack bursts. The problem with this approach is that routers commonly block ICMP messages because of security issues associated with them.\n\nIn this type of solution, an observer tracks an existing attack flow by examining incoming and outgoing ports on routers starting from the host under attack. Thus, such a solution requires having privileged access to routers along the attack path.\n\nTo bypass this restriction and automate this process, Stone proposes routing suspicious packets on an overlay network using ISP edge routers. By simplifying the topology, suspicious packets can easily be re-routed to a specialized network for further analysis.\n\nBy nature of DoS, any such attack will be sufficiently long lived for tracking in such a fashion to be possible. Layer-three topology changes, while hard to mask to a determined attacker, have the possibility of alleviating the DoS until the routing change is discovered and subsequently adapted to. Once the attacker has adapted, the re-routing scheme can once again adapt and re-route; causing an oscillation in the DoS attack; granting some ability to absorb the impact of such an attack.\n\nHal Burch and William Cheswick propose a controlled flooding of links to determine how this flooding affects the attack stream. Flooding a link will cause all packets, including packets from the attacker, to be dropped with the same probability. We can conclude from this that if a given link were flooded, and packets from the attacker slowed, then this link must be part of the attack path. Then recursively upstream routers are “coerced” into performing this test until the attack path is discovered.\n\nThe traceback problem is complicated because of spoofed packets. Thus, a related effort is targeted towards preventing spoofed packets; known as ingress filtering. Ingress Filtering restricts spoofed packets at ingress points to the network by tracking the set of legitimate source networks that can use this router.\n\nPark and Lee present an extension of Ingress Filtering at layer 3. They present a means of detecting false packets, at least to the subnet, by essentially making use of existing OSPF routing state to have routers make intelligent decisions about whether or not a packet should be routed.\n"}

He studied Latin American issues. In 1935, he traveled to Cuba with the League of American Writers to investigate possible human rights abuses. Sometime during this period, Halperin joined the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA). In the late summer of 1941, Halperin went to work in the Office of the Coordinator of Information which later became the Research Division of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), itself a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. Halperin became head of the Latin American Research and Analysis Division and special assistant to Duncan Lee. During this period, he may have become an espionage agent and agreed to provide intelligence for the Joseph Stalin-era Soviet intelligence service, the NKVD. Halperin's NKVD codename was \"Hare.\" He became a member of the \"Golos\" spy network operated by the NKVD's chief of American operations Gaik Ovakimian.\n\nWith access to the OSS cable room, Halperin could secure copies of secret U.S. reports from any part of the world. Through the \"Golos\" spy network, Halperin provided Soviet intelligence with a large quantity of sensitive U.S. diplomatic dispatches, including reports from Ambassador John Gilbert Winant in London on the position of the Polish government-in-exile towards negotiations with Stalin, Turkey's foreign policy toward Romania, the State Department's instructions to the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, the U.S. embassy in Morocco's reports on that country's government, reports on the U.S. government's relationship with Vichy and Free French factions and persons in exile, reports of peace feelers from dissident Germans passed to the Vatican, U.S. attitudes towards Josip Broz Tito's Communist Front activities in Yugoslavia, and discussions between the Greek government and the United States regarding Soviet ambitions in the Balkans. Halperin also distorted OSS reports with false information in order to reflect the views of Stalin, the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party of the United States.\n\nIn 1945, defecting Soviet espionage courier Elizabeth Bentley told agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that from 1942 to 1944, when he was an official of the OSS, Haperin delivered \"to Mary Price and later to myself mimeographed bulletins and reports prepared by OSS on a variety of topics and also supplied excerpts from State Department cables to which he evidently had access.\" She added that \"some time early in 1945 'JACK', [Soviet agent Joseph Katz] the Russian contact at that time, told me that Halperin had been accused by General William J. Donovan, the head of OSS, of being a Soviet agent...\"\n\nThe next day, the FBI notified Harry S. Truman's White House that \"according to a \"highly confidential source,\" among those \"employed by the government of the United States\" who \"have been furnishing data and information to persons outside the Federal government, who are in turn transmitting this information to espionage agents of the Soviet government,\" was \"Maurice Halperin, Office of Strategic Services.\" Subsequent surveillance of Halperin disclosed that he was in contact with Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, Lauchlin Currie, Philip and Mary Jane Keeney, and others.\n\nAfter the OSS was dissolved in 1945, Halperin transferred to the State Department and worked as an adviser to United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson on Latin American affairs. Halperin was an advisor to the United Nations at the first conference in San Francisco. He resigned from the State Department in 1946 to take the position of chair of Latin American studies at Boston University.\n\nIn 1953, after Soviet cables were secretly decrypted by U.S. counter-intelligence, Maurice Halperin was called before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee to defend himself on charges of espionage. Halperin denied the charges, but nevertheless fled to Mexico and then, to avoid extradition, to the Soviet Union. Among the friends he made there was the British defector, Donald Maclean as well as Cuban revolutionary leader Che Guevara.\n\nDisenchanted with communism in the Soviet Union, Halperin accepted Guevara's invitation to come to Havana in 1962. There he worked for the Fidel Castro government for five years before political tensions forced him to leave for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He became there a political science professor at Simon Fraser University, and wrote several books critical of Castro's government and the socio-political situation in Cuba.\n\nHe died in Canada on February 9, 1995.\n\nAfter Halperin's death, the release of the \"Venona project\" decryptions of coded Soviet cables, as well as information gleaned from Soviet KGB archives, revealed that Halperin was involved in espionage activities on behalf of the Soviet Union while serving in an official capacity with the United States government.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1969089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969089", "title": "Rollercoaster (1977 film)", "text": "Rollercoaster (1977 film)\n\nRollercoaster is a 1977 American disaster-suspense film starring George Segal, Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda and Timothy Bottoms, and directed by James Goldstone. It was one of the few films to be shown in Sensurround, which caused those watching the movie to vibrate during certain periods during the \"thrill scenes\" on the rides.\n\nAn unnamed man (Timothy Bottoms) (simply called \"young man\" in the credits) sneaks into Ocean View Amusement Park and places a small radio-controlled bomb on the tracks of the park's wooden roller coaster, The Rocket. The bomb detonates, a coaster train derails, killing and injuring the riders. Safety inspector Harry Calder (George Segal), who initially cleared the ride, is called to the park to investigate. A park worker tells Calder that he saw what he thought was a park maintenance man up on the tracks earlier that day but did not state that the man was someone other than the park had authorized to be there.\n\nIn Pittsburgh the bomber causes a fire on a dark ride at another park. Calder suspects the incidents might be linked, and learns that the executives of companies running the largest amusement parks in America are holding a meeting in Chicago. Calder flies to Chicago and intrudes on the meeting. One of the executives plays a tape sent by the bomber, wherein he demands $1 million to stop his activities.\n\nBack home, Calder is visited by FBI Agent Hoyt (Richard Widmark), who says the extortion money is to be delivered by Calder at Kings Dominion. There, Calder is ordered to wait at a telephone and the bomber calls, warning him there is a bomb in the park. He sends Calder a two-way radio so that he can keep contact, then orders Calder to go on various rides in the park such as the Rebel Yell roller coaster. While Calder is riding on the Skyway to the station near the Singing Mushrooms, the bomber tells Calder that the bomb is located in the radio. He warns Calder not to throw it away, because it will explode on impact on the paths below, which are occupied by many of the park's visitors. He orders Calder to falsely signal that he has made the delivery, in order to distract the FBI, then leave the money on a bench. Calder complies and walks away. Later, Hoyt admits that he marked the money (violating the bomber's instructions). Calder demands to be sent home and leaves the bomb radio with the bomb squad.\n\nBack home, Calder gets another call from the bomber. He blames Calder for the marked money, and threatens another attack. Assuming it will be directed at Calder personally, he deduces that the next target will be Revolution at Magic Mountain. The FBI rejects Calder's hypothesis, but decide to investigate anyway because the ride is scheduled to debut on July 4, when park attendance will be at its highest for the season. Agents disguised as park maintenance men eventually find a bomb attached to the tracks and disarm it.\n\nThe bomber returns to his car and gets a new bomb just as the Revolution is about to open. In order to get on board, he pays a park guest $100 for his \"Gold Ticket\", which entitles the holder to be one of the first passengers. He places the bomb under his seat in the rear of the train. Following the inaugural ride, Calder recognizes the bomber's voice during his ride exit interview with a reporter. He chases the bomber, and alerts the agents that he might have placed something in the coaster train. The train leaves the chain lift on its second ride through.\n\nThe bomber is eventually cornered and threatens to blow up the ride, holding the detonator in his hand while the agents try to jam the signal. He demands a firearm. Calder takes one from an agent and begins to hand it to him. Agents succeed in jamming the detonator's signal, and alert Calder. Calder retains the gun but in doing so accidentally shoots the bomber, who then runs away. He hops a fence into the area below the Revolution and runs blindly, eventually circling back toward Calder. The bomber climbs onto the track, but sees Calder and freezes. He is hit and killed by the coaster train. The ride re-opens following the accident.\n\n\nThis was the third film to be presented in Sensurround. Special low-frequency bass speakers were used during the roller coaster sequences. Sensurround was employed in only three other films released by Universal: \"Earthquake\" (1974), \"Midway\" (1976), and the theatrical version of \"Battlestar Galactica\" (1978).\n\n\"Sensurround is as big a star as there is in movies today,\" said Sidney Sheinberg, head of MCA, who attributed the better-than-expected success of \"Earthquake\" and \"Midway\" at the box office to the device.\n\nThe film was announced in July 1976. It had the producer and director of \"Swashbuckler\". Director James Goldstone said the film was \"not a disaster movie but a Hitchcock like suspense cat and mouse story.\"\nGeorge Segal's casting was announced in August 1976. He called it \"simply an action-adventure, something Alfred Hitchcock would do, structured beautifully, and combined with Universal's technology.\" Goldstone said Segal had \"that humanity factor and it does come through. George plays the Everyman character who is repeatedly dumped on but who's never a buffoon... He knows who he is and is therefore free to take chances, to try something new, to expose his vulnerability.\"\n\nOpposite was Timothy Bottoms. \"It's the first time I've ever played the villain,\" said Bottoms. Helen Hunt, in her first feature film, has a supporting role as Tracy Calder, Harry's teenage daughter. Steve Guttenberg, in his first film role, has an uncredited bit part as a messenger at Magic Mountain who brings the plans for the Revolution to Calder and Hoyt. Craig Wasson, in his second film, appears as a hippie. Radio announcer Charlie Tuna also appears in the film as the MC for the concert and The Revolution coaster launch.\n\nThe film features an appearance by the band Sparks for the roller coaster's opening concert, playing the songs \"Fill 'Er Up\" and \"Big Boy\" from their 1976 album \"Big Beat\". Sparks later cited their appearance in the film when asked about the biggest regret of their career.\n\nFilming started 13 September 1976.\n\nSeveral real amusement parks were used in the film for the various park and roller coaster scenes. Ocean View Park in Norfolk, Virginia was used for the first park in the film. Although the park was located on the Chesapeake Bay, it was described as a west coast park in the film. Goldstone chose the park because of its old fashioned feeling. The park's major wooden roller coaster, The Skyrocket, was renamed simply \"The Rocket\" for the film. Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia, also appeared in the film. Some of the rides featured in the film, such as the Shenandoah Lumber Company and Rebel Yell wooden roller coaster, still exist today. The final park used was Magic Mountain (now called Six Flags Magic Mountain) in Valencia, California. The park's Great American Revolution roller coaster was featured prominently in the film's climax.\n\nOriginally, Kennywood was one of the locations to be used in the opening \"crash\" segment of the film. But after the park's owners declined their participation, the producers of the film ended up shooting the \"Wonder World\" segment at Kings Dominion instead.\n\nAccording to Goldstone, the three parks that appeared in the final film were chosen from over 20 candidates.\n\nAdditionally, parts of the movie were filmed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.\n\nThe film's musical score was written by composer Lalo Schifrin.\n\nDespite having been released in the late spring of 1977, and being overshadowed by the smash hit \"\", it went on to be a moderate success at the box office. However it was considered a financial disappointment and Universal lost enthusiasm for Sensurround films.\n\nReviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"effective pop entertainment that, like an amusement-park ride, deals in the sensation of suspense for the foolish fun of it.\" \n\nGene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it \"a traffic accident masquerading as a movie\" with \"one of the dullest villains imaginable.\" \n\nCharles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in a positive review that the film \"is not so much a disaster story as an unexpectedly articulate and well-polished piece of cat-and-mouse suspense whose derivation is more from Hitchcock than, say, Irwin Allen.\" \n\nGary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"[t]he Sensurround process, fundamentally unnecessary as it is, supplements the subjective visual thrills effectively.\" He added, \"There's such a disparity of interest between the locations themselves and the melodramatic motions the actors are required to go through that one could easily believe Universal had a greater stake in the amusement park business than the movie business.\" \n\n\"Variety\" said that, 'The rollercoaster rides are the picture’s highlights and they are fabulous.' \"Time Out London\" felt that 'the results should have been sensational,' but that, 'ultimately the film-makers botched the job. Many of the best runs are interrupted by close-ups, and the filler plot is dumb in the extreme.' \n\nThe film holds an approval rating of 58% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes as of October 23, 2019, based on twelve reviews.\n\n"}

The cancelled plans mentioned in this article had dated back to the early 1990s.\n\nThe planned system included three lines, which were to have been: \nAll three lines would have met in Leeds city centre in a loop line running along The Headrow, Park Row, Boar Lane, Kirkgate and behind Kirkgate Market. \nThe three lines were to have been the start of a wider system which included plans for other tram lines from Leeds city centre to Bradford via Armley, Bramley and Stanningley and to Alwoodley via Chapeltown, Chapel Allerton and Moortown (the latter being mentioned in the draft Leeds Unitary Development Plan).\n\nFollowing long standing delays in attempting to gain funding throughout the 1990s due to rejections by the previous John Major administration, in 2002 Leeds was successful in acquiring central government funding for the construction of the scheme. Two consortia of Momentis (which included FirstGroup, Bombardier Transportation, Bouygues and Jarvis Facilities) and Airelink (which included Arriva and Siemens Transportation Systems) had bid on the construction and operation of Leeds Supertram which was intended to have opened in 2007 or 2008. Preparation work on Leeds Supertram had started in 2003 where preparatory work was done at Leeds City Square and around the junction of the A61 South Accommodation Road and A639 Hunslet Road.\n\nHowever work to construct the system that was due to start in earnest in 2004 was suspended because of costs that were originally £500 million had risen far above this level to figures around £1 billion. This had resulted in a cut back to the system that would have seen Line 1 only go from the city centre to the park and ride site at Stourton and this would have saved £250 million from the construction of the scheme and efforts were done to lower development costs along the other planned routes. However despite this in late 2005, Transport Minister Alistair Darling said that he would not give the go-ahead for the scheme, despite £40 million having already been spent into the development of the scheme.\n\nAlternatives for the future of transport in Leeds are now being discussed, in particular a Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, which the government claim can deliver some of the benefits of Supertram with lower capital costs due to unsegregated routes and greater flexibility but an on long term higher price (due to shorter life expectancy of rolling stock). However, no system of this type has yet been delivered in the UK, which introduces an element of risk, although similar systems in the US have experienced lower ridership than comparable light rail lines. Another possibility currently being investigated by the local transport authority is a tram-train system. On such a system trams are capable of running onto mainline railways, being either built to handle 25 kV AC electrification or being partially diesel-powered (UK trams are electrified at 750 V DC).\n\n"}

It was the first Bee Gees release to be produced by Arif Mardin, who was partially responsible for launching the group's later major success with the follow-up album \"Main Course\". The album's music incorporates more rhythm and blues, soul and funk and hard rock than their previous albums.\n\nThe album reached No. 178 on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Mr. Natural\" was also the first album to feature drummer Dennis Bryon. Although the album contains R&B and soul numbers, Barry said that the album was \"whiter\" than their next album \"Main Course\" (on which he said that they started to turn black on their songs).\n\nThe decision to work with Mardin came after the RSO label rejected the brothers' post-\"Life in a Tin Can\" album, which had been provisionally entitled \"A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants\". Robert Stigwood was not ready to give up on the Bee Gees, but he did not believe in the musical direction they were taking. At the suggestion of Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic, Stigwood sent them to work with Atlantic producer and arranger Arif Mardin, who began to draw out their love of rhythm and blues music. Mardin brought the band's attention to the dance scene unfolding at the time, and the brothers Gibb in turn adapted their songwriting and arrangements to a more upbeat style.\n\nRecording began in November 1973, and although they were self-conscious about doing a really black sound, their first goal was to record songs in a way that they could reproduce on stage. They made more use of Alan Kendall's lead guitar and added a keyboardist, which resulted in less recording for Maurice, who had long overdubbed many instrumental and backing vocal parts; he would now focus almost exclusively on playing bass and singing backing vocals during the trio's R&B/disco era. The new sound was more electric than much of what they had done since regrouping in 1970. With Mardin at the helm, the Bee Gees returned to the IBC Studios, London where they had recorded much of their pre-\"Life in a Tin Can\" output. The first two songs recorded were harder rock (\"Heavy Breathing\" and \"I Can't Let You Go\"), both written in Los Angeles. This was a deliberate attempt to record a new sound, compared to the acoustic sounds found on \"Life in a Tin Can\". There were also two new backing musicians: Dennis Bryon on drums and Geoff Westley on keyboards, who were in the tour band, now made their debut with the Bee Gees on disc. Bryon was a friend of Kendall, and would be the Bee Gees' drummer until 1980. The big change here was having Westley, or in fact anyone, play most of the piano and keyboard parts that had been Maurice's domain for years. Westley would soon be replaced as keyboardist by ex-Strawbs keyboardist Derek \"Blue\" Weaver, whom Bryon had played with in Amen Corner. Around this time, Maurice's problems with alcohol began to surface; although he wrote few songs in 1974, he never missed a show or a recording session, but on this album, most of the new songs were written by Barry and Robin only. Three songs were written by all three brothers; one, \" Lost in Your Love\" was a solo Barry composition while \"Give A Hand, Take A Hand\" was a Barry/Maurice composition (see Notes). The songs \"Mr. Natural\" and \"Had a Lot of Love Last Night\" were recorded and completed at the Command Studios in London. The songs \"Give a Hand, Take a Hand\" and \"Lost in Your Love\" were recorded at Atlantic Studios in 1974. Maurice said in an interview with Lynn Redgrave that his alcoholism didn't affect his recording sessions and concerts until around the time of Spirits Having Flown.\n\nThe sessions of \"Mr. Natural\" features Barry doing his impression for Maurice. \"When we did \"Mr. Natural\" we didn't have a positive direction\", Maurice said, \"We were trashing about\". In an interview with the Bee Gees for \"Billboard\" on 24 March 2001, Maurice recalls about producer Arif Mardin, \"Arif was brilliant, full of ideas. That's why we did the \"Mr. Natural\" album with him, which was like a rehearsal\".\n\n\"Mr. Natural\" generated no global hits, but represented an important step in The Bee Gees' evolution. The album shows a strong Philadelphia soul influence in tracks like \"Throw a Penny\". Other highlights include \"Mr. Natural\", the infectious hard rock tunes \"Down the Road\" (the beginning of which starts during the long fade of \"Throw a Penny,\" about 20 seconds before \"Throw a Penny\" segues into \"Down the Road\") and \"Heavy Breathing\", and the power ballad \"Charade\". Despite the fact that the Bee Gees and Mardin point to the background vocal session for \"Nights on Broadway\" as the genesis of the trademark Bee Gee falsetto, those with keen ears can hear a distinctive (albeit subtle in comparison to later recordings) Barry Gibb falsetto in the backing vocals of \"Dogs\". Despite sincere attempts to create a new sound, \"Mr. Natural\" was not commercially successful\".\n\nThe gospel-tinged song \"Give a Hand, Take a Hand\" was written in 1969 (hence Robin's lack of writing credit, since he wasn't working with his brothers at the time) and originally recorded for their 1970 album \"Cucumber Castle\" but was not released and was used by P.P. Arnold; her version was released in September 1969 as a single, which was produced by Barry Gibb. The Staple Singers also covered \"Give a Hand, Take a Hand\"; their version was released on their 1971 album \"The Staple Swingers\".\n\nOn the album cover, the Bee Gees are not pictured anywhere in the exterior album package. The front and back are an art concept of a man in a bar, looking blissfully out the window on the front and being ejected smiling on the back, and on the paper, it says \"Every SUNDAY brunch\".

The promotion specializes in hardcore wrestling involving weapons such as barbed wire and fire. They held their first show on October 6, 1989. In the late 1990s, FMW had a brief working agreement with Extreme Championship Wrestling, and as well had 14 DVDs released in the U.S. by Tokyopop. On March 4, 2015, FMW was resurrected under the name Chō Sentō Puroresu FMW.\n\nIn August 1990, Onita wrestled in the first ever exploding barbed wire match with Tarzan Goto. This match started a revolution amongst the small \"garbage wrestling\" organizations of Japan. From there, Onita recruited some of hardcore wrestling's most notable names, like Mr. Pogo, Mitsuhiro Matsunaga, Super Leather (Leatherface) and Kintaro Kanemura. In October 1990, they held Japan's first mixed tag team match. In 1995, Onita wrestled his retirement match with young talent Hayabusa in an exploding ring, barbed wire steel cage match. Hayabusa became the central star of the promotion winning its belt several times and battling most of the FMW roster. FMW also had a thriving women's wrestling division, led by Megumi Kudo who was one of FMW's biggest stars in her heyday. All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling talent feared them so much that they rarely had inter-promotional matches against each other, but the FMW women were successful in other feuds with LLPW and JWP. During this time FMW signed a contract to hold a major event every May 5 in the Kawasaki Stadium.\n\nUnder new FMW president Shoichi Arai, the promotion began to falter. Arai brought in former International Pro Wrestling, All Japan Pro Wrestling and Super World of Sports star Kodo Fuyuki as the new booker and in 1998 he brought an end to the garbage/death matches in favor of an entertainment-oriented style based on that of the WWE. Although this saved the roster from further potential injury, it called into question the essence of FMW's wrestling. Onita began withdrawing further into the background, eventually leaving the promotion altogether to create his own death match ventures and to go back to high school to earn his diploma.\n\nOn October 22, 2001, in a match against Mammoth Sasaki, Hayabusa attempted a springboard moonsault—one of his signature moves—but slipped on the ropes and fell directly on his neck, breaking it and paralyzing him. He retired, but actually regained some control over his legs a year later. By the end of 2001, Arai owed about a million dollars to influential organizations in Japan, rumored to be connected to the Yakuza (or Japanese Mafia). Realizing that the promotion was going nowhere, he decided to finally close its doors. FMW came to an end with a final show on February 4, 2002 and Shoichi Arai declared FMW bankrupt on February 15, 2002. On May 16, 2002, Arai hanged himself by his tie in a Tokyo park to collect life insurance for his family to pay off his debt to the Yakuza.\n\nThe talent divided into two promotions: Kodo Fuyuki's World Entertainment Wrestling (WEW), the name of FMW's title governing body since 1999, and Mr. Gannosuke's Wrestling Marvelous Future (WMF). Some of the talent also made appearances on Onita's special shows. Following Fuyuki's death in 2003, most of the WEW talent formed a successor promotion, Apache Pro-Wrestling Army.\n\nOn April 3, 2015, Hideki Takahashi, Hayabusa and Choden Senshi Battle Ranger held a press conference, announcing they were reviving FMW under the new name \"Chō Sentō Puroresu FMW\". Takahashi would serve as the president and Hayabusa as the executive producer of the promotion, which would also feature participation from Atsushi Onita. The promotion held its first event on April 21. On October 30, 2015, they announced that they were reviving the FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship, as they set a match to determine new champions on December 22.\n\nIn 2016, two tragedies had befallen FMW. On February 17, 2016, Ray announced that she had inoperable stage three brain cancer after being diagnosed with a tumor in December 2015 and undergoing a biopsy on January 21, 2016. She succumbed to the disease in 2018. Over two weeks later on March 3, 2016, Hayabusa died at his home from a brain aneurysm, at the age of 47.\n\nOn October 31, 2017, FMW founder Atsushi Onita retired after 43 years in the ring. The promotion is still in operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The area covers the unitary authorities of Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees. The constituency boundaries used up to the 2005 United Kingdom general election were drawn up when it was a county. The area is divided into 6 Parliamentary constituencies – 5 Borough constituencies and 1 County constituency.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England proposed retaining these 6 constituencies, with changes to realign constituency boundaries with the boundaries of current local government wards, and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies.

It is the simplest alkene exhibiting \"cis\"/\"trans\"-isomerism (also known as (\"E\"/\"Z\")-isomerism); that is, it exists as two geometric isomers \"cis\"-2-butene ((\"Z\")-2-butene) and \"trans\"-2-butene ((\"E\")-2-butene).\n\nIt is a petrochemical, produced by the catalytic cracking of crude oil or the dimerization of ethylene. Its main uses are in the production of gasoline (petrol) and butadiene, although some 2-butene is also used to produce the solvent butanone via hydration to 2-butanol followed by oxidation.\n\nThe two isomers are extremely difficult to separate by distillation because of the proximity of their boiling points (~1 °C for \"cis\" and ~4 °C for \"trans\"). However, separation is unnecessary in most industrial settings, as both isomers behave similarly in most of the desired reactions. A typical industrial 2-butene mixture is 70% (\"Z\")-2-butene (\"cis\"-isomer) and 30% (\"E\")-2-butene (\"trans\"-isomer). Butane and 1-butene are common impurities, present at 1% or more in industrial mixtures, which also contain smaller amounts of isobutene, butadiene and butyne.\n"}
{"id": "1969172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969172", "title": "Audi RS 4", "text": "Audi RS 4\n\nThe Audi RS 4 is the high-performance variant of the Audi A4 range produced by Audi Sport GmbH, for AUDI AG, a division of the Volkswagen Group. It slots distinctly above the Audi S4, as the fastest, most sports-focused car based on the A4's \"B\" automobile platform. The RS 4 made a return in 2012, in Avant form based on the A4 Avant.\n\nThe original B5 version was produced only as an Avant, Audi's name for an estate car/station wagon. The second version, the B7, was released initially as a four-door five-seat saloon/sedan, with the Avant following a short while later. A two-door four-seat Cabriolet version was subsequently added. Furthermore, their unique internal combustion engines are all front-mounted, and are longitudinally oriented. The transmission is mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle, and contains both a center and front differential.\n\nThe \"RS\" initials are taken from the —literally translated as \"racing sport\", and is the Audi marque's highest trim level, positioned above the \"S\" model specification of Audi's regular model line-up. Like all Audi \"RS\" cars, the RS 4 pioneers some of Audi's latest advanced technology, and could therefore be described as a \"halo vehicle\". Furthermore, it is only available with Audi's Torsen-based \"trademark\" quattro permanent four-wheel drive system.\n\nIts main market competitors include the BMW M3, Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG, Lexus IS-F and Cadillac ATS-V.\n\nThe original B5 Audi RS 4 Avant quattro (\"Typ\" 8D) was introduced by Audi in late 1999, for main production and sale from 2000, as the successor to the Porsche / quattro GmbH joint venture-developed Audi RS2 Avant. The vehicle, like its RS2 predecessor, was available only as an Avant and was built on an existing platform, in this case the Volkswagen Group B5 platform shared with the A4 and S4. Retail price was around DM 103,584. The RS 4 was available for sale in most of Europe, parts of Asia and in some Latin American countries.\n\nAudi produced 6,030 units between 1999 and 2001.\n\nAlthough related to the Audi B5 S4, many of the outer body panels were altered, with wider front and rear wheel arches, to allow for the wider axle track on the RS 4. With unique front and rear bumpers and side sills, and the rear spoiler from the S4 Avant, the aerodynamic modifications achieved a drag coefficient of C 0.34. Although the B5 S4 came in a saloon car body style, the B5 RS 4 was only available in the Avant version.\n\nLuggage space, measured according to the industry standard VDA method was with the rear seats in the upright position, and with the seats folded flat.\n\nThe engine was developed from the 2.7 litre 90° V6 'biturbo' used in the B5 S4. It displaced and had five valves per cylinder. The parts code prefix was 078 and the identification codes were: early version, 2000 (EU2 compliant): ASJ, and later version, 2000-01 (to EU3 standard): AZR. This engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). It featured enlarged intake and smaller exhaust ports on the two Cosworth cast aluminium alloy ALSi7mg cylinder heads, two parallel BorgWarner K04-series turbochargers, two larger side-mounted intercoolers (SMICs), dished piston crowns, stronger connecting rods, larger intake ducting, enlarged exhaust system, and a re-calibrated engine management system. The modifications increased the engine's output from and of torque in S4 form to at 7,000 rpm and at 6,000 rpm. The engine was controlled by a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), using a Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic drive by wire throttle. It had multipoint sequential fuel injection, a MAF, six individual single-spark coils and NGK longlife spark plugs. The engine oil was cooled by a dual oil:water cooler and an oil:air cooler.\n\nA six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: FDP) (gear ratios—1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.806, 6th: 0.684), cooled by a NACA duct in the engine undertray, and Audi's Torsen-based quattro system, using the Torsen T-1 \"automatic torque biasing\" (ATB) center differential, with a 50:50 default bias were standard. Final drive ratio was 4.111.\n\nThe RS 4 has a kerb weight of . It can accelerate from 0- in 4.9 seconds, 0- in 11.3 seconds, and 0- in 17.0 seconds. \n\nBrakes were also developed jointly in house by Audi's quattro GmbH, not by Porsche as with its predecessor, the RS2. At the front they were radially vented and floating cast iron discs, diameter and thick, with double-piston floating calipers, and at the rear by discs with a single-piston floating caliper. The RS 4 needed less than to come to a full stop from a speed of .\n\nThe standard wheels were 18 inch alloys (8½×18\" \"9-spoke\"), with 255/35 ZR18 high performance tyres. Optional \"winter\" alloy wheels were also available, at 18 inch (7½J×18\"), with tyres.\n\n\nThere was no RS 4 built on the Audi \"B6\" platform that served as the basis for the Audi A4 between 2001 and 2005. However, after a long hiatus, the second Audi RS 4 quattro (\"Typ\" 8E), was built on Audi's \"B7\" A4 platform, by quattro GmbH in Neckarsulm, Germany. It was unveiled in February 2005 at Audi's 'quattro Night' celebration at the company headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany.\n\nThe RS 4 became available to European customers in mid-2006. It was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January, and arrived in June 2006 in North America. The production run of the B7 RS 4 was 2006 to 2008 inclusive, although only 2007 and 2008 model year were sold in the United States. To date, approximately 10,000 B7 RS 4s have been built, of which around 2,000 are in the USA.\n\nThe B7 RS 4 Cabriolet was sold in Europe from late 2006 to 2008. It was also available in the US in limited numbers per year, and sold at a premium of $2000 over list.\n\nAudi factory numbers indicate that the B7 RS 4 saloon can accelerate from in 4.8 seconds, and arrive at in 16.6 seconds. Most European magazines recorded results in line with the November 2009 comparison of \"ultimate sedans\", in \"Road & Track\", which recorded a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.5 seconds. This is consistent with the pattern of conservatism that is usually found in Audi's official performance numbers. For the Avant, is reached in 4.9 seconds. Top speed for all variants is \"officially\" electronically limited to , \n\nThe B7 RS 4 is an almost complete departure from previous Audi \"RS\" cars, as it was initially available as a four-door five-seat saloon/sedan; with a five-door five-seat Avant (estate/wagon), and two-door four-seat Cabriolet (convertible) versions arriving later. Only the Audi RS6 had taken this similar route (saloon and Avant) before; the previous RS 4 and RS2 were available exclusively as Avants.\n\nConstructed from fully galvanised steel in a monocoque (unitary/unibody) design, the B7 RS 4 uses lightweight aluminium for its front wings (fenders) and bonnet (hood). The saloon version features a drag coefficient (C) of 0.31, from a frontal area of 2.17 m.\n\nLike its B5 predecessor, visually, the B7 RS 4 differs from its related B7 S4, by having even wider flared front and rear wheel arches (fenders), to allow for a wider axle track. Over the B7 A4, it also includes two larger frontal side air intakes (for the two additional side-mounted coolant radiators). The trim on the saloon and roof rails on the estate are chrome as standard but can also be found in black with the addition of the Optic Pack which includes a black front grill, all exterior trim and black roof rails on the estate version. The B7 RS 4 also includes an optional adaptive headlights to complement the standard \"Xenon Plus\" (Bi-Xenon) High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlamps, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements. Also standard are daytime running lights (DRLs), found within the main headlamp housings, identical to its related B7 A4 and S4, and use a conventional tungsten filament bulb. An acoustic parking system with front and rear sensors is also a standard fitment. Unique carbon fibre interior trims, along with a lap timer within the central Driver Information System (DIS), aluminium pedal caps and footrest, and RS 4 logos complete the look.\n\nIn the saloon, luggage space, measured according to the VDA 'block method', is with the rear seats in the upright position, and with the seats folded flat (dependent on specification). For the Avant, is available with the seats upright (under the retractable load cover), and being available with the rear seats folded flat (loaded to the roofline). Kerb weight of the saloon variant starts at (dependent on specification).\n\nA Bose ten-speaker sound system, with 190 watt output and automatic dynamic noise compensation (which replaces the 'GALA' found on earlier units), with \"Concert II\" radio and single CD player is standard in car entertainment (ICE) equipment. Factory fitted ICE options to complement the standard BOSE include the \"Symphony II\" system which features twin radio tuners, a single-slot loading six-CD changer and a cassette player all integrated into a double-DIN sized unit. Navigation option is the RNS-E \"Audi Navigation System plus\" DVD-ROM GPS satellite navigation, which includes a folding widescreen 6.5-inch screen, two SD-memory card readers, and MMI-like logic control.\n\nTo achieve maximum body stiffness with controlled deformation crumple zones, the B7 RS 4 features laser beam welding of major seams of the high-strength steel body shell, which helps improve overall structural rigidity, particularly in the \"passenger cell\", over traditional spot welding methods.\n\nTwo-stage driver and front seat passenger frontal airbags are standard, as is Audi's \"sideguard\" head protection curtain airbag system. This latter system completely covers all of the side windows, from the front 'A pillar' to the rear \"C-\" or \"D pillars\". The body-hugging Recaro shell-type RS race bucket seats (not available in North American markets), complete with electrically inflatable upper and lower side bolsters and adjustable lumbar support, are constructed so as not to need lower side airbags to comply with European crash safety standards. In North America, the only front seats available are the more traditional Recaro seats (identical to those in the B6 and B7 S4), which include lower side airbags; these were also available as a no-cost option in other markets. Lower side airbags are optional for the standard-fit Recaro rear seats. Front and outer rear seatbelts include pyrotechnic belt pretensioners, whilst all belts include an excess load limit function.\n\nThe engine of the B7 RS 4 is based on the existing all-alloy V8 from the B6 S4, and shares many parts, and Fuel Stratified Injection, with the 4.2 FSI V8 engine in the Q7. The engine includes new cylinder block construction, and is a highly reworked, high-revving variant (redline at 8,000 rpm; rev limit of 8,250 rpm).\nThe parts code and version is 079.D and the identification code is BNS.\n\nThe same engine base was used for the Audi R8 when Audi wanted to build their first supercar. However, the camshaft drive system was moved to the front of the block for the mid-engine R8.\n\nThe engine has increased crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return system and a baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by roller chains with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98 RON (93 AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces at 7,800 rpm giving it a specific power output of per litre. Based on a kerb weight of , this results in a power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kg. This engine also produces of torque at 5,500 rpm, 90 percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600 rpm. (Using lower 95 RON (91 AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED 9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329 grams of CO per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324 g/km.\n\nA 6-speed Getrag manual transmission (parts code: 0A3, identification codes: HLD, JMH) is the only transmission available. The gear ratios are 1st: 3.667, 2nd: 2.211, 3rd: 1.520, 4th: 1.133, 5th: 0.919, 6th: 0.778.\n\nThe Audi B7 RS 4 was the only \"RS\" Audi powered by a naturally aspirated engine until the Audi RS5 was presented at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The RS5 also uses a 4.2 litre high revving V8. The RS5 also dropped the Getrag 6-speed manual in favour of a 7-speed \"S tronic\" dual clutch semi-automatic.\n\nAnother focus of the B7 RS 4 was on the introduction of the latest development of Audi's 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. This utilised the 'third generation' asymmetric/dynamic Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential, featuring a 'default' 40:60 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions. Audi stressed that this would result in a more neutral response in corners, and a more dynamic driving experience. That means that one side of the differential can handle up to 80%, while the other side would have to only handle 20% of applied torque.\n\nFront and rear axle differentials are conventional \"open\" types, with a final drive ratio of 4.111.\n\nTraction is assisted by way of Audi's \"Electronic Differential Lock\" (EDL), which is a specific function of the Robert Bosch GmbH ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme system. EDL monitors the rotational speeds of the left and right wheels across an individual axle, and if one wheel should rotate faster than the other (exceeding the pre-defined parameters), indicating loss of traction, or \"wheel spin\" on one wheel, the EDL applies the brakes to that individual spinning wheel, and thus results in transferring torque across the open differential to the wheel on the other side deemed to have grip, hence traction. Also included in the ESP 8.0 is \"Anti Slip Regulation\" (ASR)—Audi's name for Traction Control System.\n\nThe result of all these features is that under normal circumstances (driving straight on dry or even wet road surfaces) the car never loses traction, even when accelerating at full throttle in the first gear.\n\nThe B7 RS 4 also incorporates Audi's \"Dynamic Ride Control\" (DRC) \"Sports Suspension\" mechanism. The dampers (shock absorbers) are made for Audi by KW, and central reservoirs/valves made by KYB (Kayaba).\nIn the RS 4 suspension, a fluid hydraulic linkage between diagonally opposing front and rear suspension dampers (left front to right rear, and vice versa) is used to counteract vehicle pitch and roll. Lightweight magnesium/aluminium alloy multi-link suspension arms (four arm with virtual steering axis up front, and trapezoidal arm with unequal length track control arms at the rear) locate each hub/brake/roadwheel assembly in a controllable fashion, whilst minimising unsprung masses. Lightweight hollow tubular anti-roll bars are standard front and rear. Compared to standard B7 A4 models, the RS 4 features a lower ride height. An optional \"Sports Suspension Plus\" lowers the car by a further , and marginally further stiffens the damper rates.\n\nAxle track has also been increased over standard A4s; the front widened by , to and the rear by to .\n\nSpeed sensitive \"servotronic\" variable-assistance electro-hydraulic power assisted steering (PAS) is controlled from a compact flat-bottomed steering wheel, finished in perforated leather with mock-aluminium trim. The steering rack ratio is 13.1:1, and the turning circle is .\n\nThe standard brakes on the RS 4 are of two-piece construction. The cast iron discs are cross-drilled and radially ventilated and float on aluminium alloy disc hubs. The two-piece disc construction reduces unsprung mass and also reduces the transmission of heat generated by the brakes to the wheel bearings.\n\nThe front discs are in diameter and thick, and use gloss black Brembo monoblock eight-opposed-piston fixed calipers from the Lamborghini Gallardo but with Red/Silver 'RS 4' logos. These and the transmission are supplied with a cooling airflow directed from NACA ducts located in the engine front undertray.\n\nThe rear brakes are drilled, vented and floating by iron discs, with gloss black Lucas-Girling TRW single piston floating calipers with an integrated mechanical handbrake mechanism.\n\nA lighter, and higher performing, \"Audi ceramic\" front brake system was an option from 2007 model year onwards (and only with 19 inch wheels). It comprised cross-drilled, radially vented and floating Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite SGL Carbon discs, diameter and thick, with grey Brembo monoblock six-opposed-piston fixed aluminium alloy calipers. The discs have a much greater tolerance to thermal differences, virtually eliminating brake fade, and have a duration of five times greater than conventional iron discs. The ceramic brakes also reduce unsprung mass by around 50% and thereby improve steering response and overall handling.\n\nA specifically 'tuned' \"sport-biased\" Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme is standard, and includes Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA). This ESP system has three user-selectable settings: the standard default full protection mode, increased slip mode (which turns off the ASR and EDL), and ESP fully off. A useful feature of the ESP 8.0 is 'disc wiping', whereby in wet weather the ESP system applies the brakes frequently but momentarily. This removes water from the disc and pad surfaces, and helps to maintain the braking performance of dry weather. This operation is undetectable by the driver.\n\nIn the UK and Japan, the standard wheels are 19 inch alloy wheels () with (eXtraLoad) high performance tyres. This 19\" wheel and tyre package was an option for the North American, and some European markets. Factory supplied tyres included Continental SportContact 3, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2, or Pirelli P-Zero Rosso — although many owners have questioned the load-carrying abilities of the Pirellis (from unexplained sidewall failures and dubious dynamic stability), opting for the more durable Michelins at replacement time. A no-cost option of 18 inch alloy wheels () with tyres was also available, and these are standard in North American markets. A winter wheel and tire package was also available as an option, and included Dunlop SP WinterSport 3D tyres.\n\nA direct-acting Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is standard fitment. This system monitors the pressure in all four tyres every three seconds, and when any loss in pressure is detected, audible and visual warnings are given to alert the driver via the Driver Information System (DIS) in a timely manner.\n\nOther notable features to be found as standard equipment on cars for non-North American markets are the smaller, flat bottomed steering wheel (complete with \"Sport\" button) again selected from the VAG parts bin from the Lamborghini Gallardo like the brakes,however a standard 'multifunction' steering wheel was a no-cost option, body-hugging Recaro shell-type race bucket seats complete with electrically inflatable upper and lower side bolsters.\n\nThe North American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash-tested the B7 RS 4's sibling, the B7 A4, and awarded it \"Double Best Pick\" for frontal and side crashes—beating illustrious rivals such as the BMW 3 Series, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, however at the 2012 session of the SOT (small overlap test ) the A4 was rated Poor, rating applying up to the 2016 MY. ()\nThe Audi RS 4 won \"Top Gear\"'s Most Surprising Car of the Year in 2005. In 2007, the Audi RS 4 was the winner in the \"World Performance Car\" category of the International World Car of the Year (WCOTY).\n\nThe new Audi RS 4 Avant quattro was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show based on the B8 A4 Avant. In fact, the RS 4 Avant shares with the same powertrain from the RS 5 Coupé, with Audi having \"succeeded in maturing from the pragmatic but soulless perfection of the early RS5 to a more accessible, more controllable and ultimately more competent Q-car\".\n\nIt uses the Volkswagen MLB platform.\n\nCompared to the related B8 S4, the RS 4 features larger bumper air dams and features double exhaust tailpipes compared to the S4's double twin (quadruple) exhaust tailpipes. Wider arches allow for a wider axle and wheels. A completely remodelled front bumper cover with honeycomb grill compared to the standard A4 and S4 as well as remodelled rear bumper with honeycomb detailing and minor air diffuser.\n\nThe interior is largely the same but the flat-bottom steering wheel is covered entirely in perforated leather with RS badging on the steering wheel and gear stick. The interior dashboard and door liners are also detailed with carbon fibre inserts as standard although there were options to change this to aluminium or piano black.\n\nSuper Sport seats covered partly with leather part Alcantara were standard in the B8 RS 4 but as with the B7 there was a winged backed bucket seat option. It was also an option to order the seats covered entirely with leather.\n\nThe RS 4 is powered by a 4.2L FSI V8 engine producing 450ps and 430Nm of torque allowing the car to accelerate from in 4.7 seconds. The RS 4 Avant is available with a 7-speed dual clutch S-tronic transmission.\n\nNew for the B8 are 'wavy' vented and floating cast iron discs, diameter and thick, with 6-pot Brembo floating calipers, and at the rear by discs with a single-piston floating calliper.\n\nThe standard wheels were 19 inch alloys with 235/40 R19 Pirelli P-Zero performance tyres. Optional 20\" rotor design or 10 spoke alloy wheels were also available with 265/35 R20 Pirelli P-Zero tyres.\n\nAmongst the options available for the B8 RS 4, are ceramic brakes, allowing the car to perform heavy braking without having brake fade.\n\nA sports pack was available which included Sports exhaust identifiable by black exhaust tips in the rear bumper, Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) suspension. The Sports pack also came with the 20\" rotor design wheels as standard.\n\nThe sports exhaust, DRC suspension setting, steering, engine response, engine mapping and exhaust note are all adjustable using the 'Drive Select' feature which is a button on either the centre console or through the MMI display interface. Settings that can be selected are Comfort, Auto, Dynamic or Individual with the Individual setting allowing the driver to select any of comfort, auto or dynamic for a number of handling and performance options.\n\nA Sound pack was also an option, the main feature being that of the Bang and Olufsen speaker system, uprated from the standard Audi sound system. The Bang & Olufsen system include 14 speakers and sub-woofers producing 500W.\n\nA total of 7000 units of the Audi B8 RS 4 were built.\n\nIn February 2014, Audi announced a tribute to the original RS 2 Avant on its 20th anniversary by releasing a limited run of the Nogaro Limited Edition. The changes were entirely cosmetic with red brake callipers and blue Alcantara detailed interior (seats, door lining, blue carbon weave elements & blue stitching) as well as the limited edition Nogaro Blue paint exterior.\n\nThe new RS 4 Avant was unveiled at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. Noticeable changes to the B9 included a more angular exterior, newly designed wheels. The new RS 4 Avant is powered with a 2.9 TFSI V6 twin turbo engine producing 450ps and 600Nm of torque.\n\nUnlike the B8 RS 4 which had a 7-speed dual-clutch S-tronic transmission, the new RS 4 Avant is available with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission.\n\nThe B7 RS 4 was planned to replace the C5 RS6 in the SCCA Speed World Challenge, but after Champion Racing had prepared the car, it was decided not to compete in the series, due to rule changes imposed by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) on Audi concerning 4WD systems, wheels size, and engine power output. Rather than scrapping the fully built Speed World Challenge RS 4, Champion and Audi used the car as a part of the American Le Mans Series Vitesse Program, which highlights the technology link between race cars and conventional series production road cars.\n\nSix RS 4s are openly campaigned in the Superstars Series by Audi Sport Italia. Audi RS 4 quattro driver Gianni Morbidelli won the 2007 and 2008 championships.\n\n"}

Boyle novel)\n\nThe Inner Circle is a novel by T. C. Boyle first published in 2004 about the development of sexology in the United States and about Alfred Kinsey's rise to fame during the late 1940s and early 1950s as seen through the eyes of one of his loyal assistants.\n\nThis assistant, however, John Milk, is a fictional character rather than a historical person. Boyle makes it unmistakably clear in the \"Author’s Note\" that \"The Inner Circle\" \"is a work of fiction, and [that] all characters and situations have been invented, with the exception of the historical figures of Alfred C. Kinsey and his wife, Clara Bracken (McMillen) Kinsey\".\n\n\"The Inner Circle\" revolves around the tensions that are bound to arise if a small group of people deliberately abandons the traditional moral values with which they were raised in favour of an unconventional outlook on love, marriage and sex. While Kinsey preaches that sex is nothing but a \"hormonal function\" devoid of emotion, John Milk has extreme difficulty adjusting to this concept where his own wife — the young and beautiful Iris — is concerned.\n\nMilk's sexual coming of age starts in 1939 when he is a student at Indiana University in Bloomington and attends Kinsey’s “marriage course”, a lecture in which the renowned zoologist propounds his theories and his plans for the first time in front of a large audience. Still a virgin, he makes Kinsey’s acquaintance when the latter interviews him in order to take his “sex history”. Kinsey makes Milk his personal assistant despite his inexperience, but he turns out to be a quick learner, and thus the young man becomes the first member of what will be “the inner circle”: a handful of men (and, up to a point, also their wives) who furiously collaborate under Kinsey’s dictatorial rule towards the publication of the two volumes later referred to as the Kinsey Report.\n\n\nWhile the novel garnered generally favorable reviews, some reviewers and readers consider \"The Inner Circle\" to be one of Boyle’s lesser novels. The criticisms generally cite slow-moving and somewhat predictable plotting, as well as an overly-linear storyline.\n\nThe German translation of the novel bears the more lurid title Dr. Sex.\n\n\"The Inner Circle\" by T.

A focal point of all the short stories is that of social constraints acting to diminish one's contentment in life, necessitating unwanted marriages, repression of true emotion and succumbing to melancholia due to constriction within the confines of 19th-century perceived normalcy.\n\nPublished in 1888, \"Wessex Tales\" contained five stories (\"The Three Strangers\", \"The Withered Arm\", \"Fellow-Townsmen\", \"Interlopers at the Knap\", and \"The Distracted Preacher\") all published first in periodicals.\n\nFor the 1896 reprinting, Hardy added \"An Imaginative Woman,\" but in 1912 moved this to another collection, \"Life's Little Ironies\", while at the same time transferring two stories—\"A Tradition of Eighteen Hundred and Four\" and \"The Melancholy Hussar of the German Legion\"—from \"Life's Little Ironies\" to \"Wessex Tales\".\n\nSix of the short stories were adapted as television dramas by the BBC as the anthology series called \"Wessex Tales\":\n\n"}

It is a hydroxy ketone attached to two phenyl groups. It appears as off-white crystals, with a light camphor-like odor. Benzoin is synthesized from benzaldehyde in the benzoin condensation. It is chiral and it exists as a pair of enantiomers: (\"R\")-benzoin and (\"S\")-benzoin.\n\nBenzoin is \"not\" a constituent of benzoin resin obtained from the benzoin tree \"(Styrax)\" or tincture of benzoin. The main component in these natural products is benzoic acid.\n\nBenzoin was first reported in 1832 by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Woehler during their research on oil of bitter almond, which is benzaldehyde with traces of hydrocyanic acid. The catalytic synthesis by the benzoin condensation was improved by Nikolay Zinin during his time with Liebig.\n\nThe main uses of benzoin are as a precursor to benzil, which is a photoinitiator. The conversion proceeds by organic oxidation using copper(II), nitric acid, or oxone. In one study, this reaction is carried out with atmospheric oxygen and basic alumina in dichloromethane.\n\nBenzoin can be used in the preparation of several pharmaceutical drugs including oxaprozin, ditazole, and phenytoin.\n\nBenzoin is prepared from benzaldehyde via the benzoin condensation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1969218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969218", "title": "13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)", "text": "13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)\n\nThe 13th \"Waffen\" Mountain Division of the SS \"Handschar\" (1st Croatian) was a mountain infantry division of the Waffen-SS, an armed branch of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II. From March to December 1944, it fought a counter-insurgency campaign against communist-led Yugoslav Partisan resistance forces in the Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet state of Germany that encompassed almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as parts of Serbia. It was given the title Handschar () after a local fighting knife or sword carried by Ottoman policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the Ottoman Empire. It was the first non-Germanic \"Waffen\"-SS division, and its formation marked the expansion of the \"Waffen\"-SS into a multi-ethnic military force. Composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers and mostly German and Yugoslav \"Volksdeutsche\" (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it took an oath of allegiance to both Adolf Hitler and the Croatian leader Ante Pavelić.\n\nThe division fought briefly in the Syrmia region north of the Sava river prior to crossing into northeastern Bosnia. After crossing the Sava, it established a designated \"security zone\" in northeastern Bosnia between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Spreča rivers. It also fought outside the security zone on several occasions, and earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians. In late 1944, parts of the division were transferred briefly to the Zagreb area, after which the non-German members began to desert in large numbers. Over the winter of 1944–45, it was sent to the Baranja region where it fought against the Red Army and Bulgarians throughout southern Hungary, falling back via a series of defensive lines until they were inside the Reich frontier. Most of the remaining Bosnian Muslims left at this point and attempted to return to Bosnia. The rest retreated further west, hoping to surrender to the Western Allies. Most of the remaining members became prisoners of the British Army. Subsequently, 38 officers were extradited to Yugoslavia to face criminal charges, and 10 were executed. Hundreds of former members of the division fought in the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was appointed \"Poglavnik\" (leader) of an Ustaše-led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \"Italian-German quasi-protectorate\". NDH authorities, led by the Ustaše Militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Roma population living within the borders of the new state.\n\nIn an effort to secure the loyalty of the Bosnian Muslims, Pavelić ordered that a property in Zagreb be converted into a mosque that he named the \"Poglavnik's Mosque\". Despite Pavelić's assurances of equality with the Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Croatian rule. A Muslim leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. Although this was an overstatement, Muslims were underrepresented in government positions, comprising only two of 20 ministerial positions, none of the six state secretaries was a Muslim, and there were only 13 Muslim \"people representatives\" in a total of 206. Fierce fighting broke out between the Ustaše, Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and pan-Yugoslav Partisans in NDH territory. Some Ustaše Militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathisers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the Ustaše violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the Croatian Home Guard, the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as \"of minimal combat value\". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the Tuzla-based Home Guard Hadžiefendić Legion, led by Muhamed Hadžiefendić, was of any significance.\n\nThe Bosnian Muslim elite and notables in various cities and towns issued resolutions or memoranda that publicly denounced Croat-German collaborationist measures along with laws and violence against Serbs. These were issued in: Prijedor (23 September 1941), Sarajevo (12 October), Mostar (21 October), Banja Luka (12 November), Bijeljina (2 December) and Tuzla (11 December). The resolutions condemned the Ustaše in Bosnia and Herzegovina, both for their mistreatment of Muslims and for their attempts to turn Muslims and Serbs against one another. One memorandum declared that since the beginning of the Ustaše regime, the Muslims had dreaded the lawless activities that the Ustaše, Croatian government authorities and various illegal groups had been perpetrating against the Serbs.\n\nThe Bosnian Muslims' dissatisfaction with the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for protection were combined with nostalgia for the period of Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.\n\nOn 6 December 1942, \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler and key \"Waffen\"-SS recruiting officer \"SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS\" Gottlob Berger approached Hitler with the proposal to raise a Bosnian Muslim SS division. Both the Wehrmacht and the \"Waffen\"-SS were concerned about the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the NDH that tied down German military personnel needed elsewhere. A German source noted that by 1943 over 100,000 Bosnian Muslims had been killed and 250,000 had become refugees. In addition, a serious food shortage threatened the region. \"The Muslims,\" remarked \"SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS\" Artur Phleps, \"bear the special status of being persecuted by all others\".\n\nThe romantic notions that Himmler had about the Bosnian Muslims were probably significant in the division's genesis. He was personally fascinated by the Islamic faith and believed that Islam created fearless soldiers. He found their ferocity preferable to the gentility of Christians and believed their martial qualities should be further developed and put to use. He thought that Muslim men would make perfect SS soldiers as Islam \"promises them Heaven if they fight and are killed in action.\" As for their ethnic background and SS requirements, it appears that Himmler accepted the theories advanced by both Croatian and German nationalists that the Croatian people, including the Muslims, were not ethnic Slavs but pure Aryans of either Gothic or Iranian descent.\n\nHimmler was inspired by the noted successes of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry in World War I. He \"endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army in the form of a Bosnian Muslim SS Division\". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local \"order\". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. \"Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by ... the Bosnian division ... so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state.\"\n\nHitler formally approved the project in mid-February 1943 and Himmler put Phleps, commander of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division \"Prinz Eugen\", in charge of raising the first SS division to be recruited from a non-Germanic people.\n\nOn 18 February 1943, Phleps travelled to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the NDH government. He met with German foreign ministry envoy Siegfried Kasche and NDH Foreign Minister Dr. Mladen Lorković who represented Pavelić. Pavelić had already agreed to raise the division, but the \"Waffen\"-SS and NDH governments had very different ideas of how it would be recruited and controlled. Lorković suggested that it be named the SS Ustaša Division, a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar geographically based regimental names such as \"Bosna\", \"Krajina\" and \"Una\". This reflected the concerns shared by Pavelić and Kasche that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word \"Croatian\" was included in its official title and Catholic Croatian officers were recruited. Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit, leaving the NDH very unhappy with the outcome, particularly regarding its ethnic composition.\n\n\"SS-Standartenführer\" Karl von Krempler, a specialist in Islam who spoke Serbo-Croatian, was charged by Himmler and Phleps with organising the division. On 3 March 1943, Phleps met with von Krempler, who was to work with NDH government representative Alija Šuljak. The campaign began on 20 March 1943, when von Krempler and Šuljak began an 18-day recruiting tour through 11 Bosnian districts. With assistance from the SS, recruiting rallies were held in the towns of Živinice and Gračanica. In the meantime the Germans began raising the divisional headquarters staff in Berlin, including \"SS-Standartenführer der Reserve\" Herbert von Oberwurzer, who was transferred from the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord to command the division.\n\nŠuljak and von Krempler soon fell out over the aims and purposes of the proposed division. Šuljak, an entirely political appointee, criticised von Krempler's Serbian dialect and his use of traditional Islamic colours and emblems (green flags and crescent moons) during the recruitment drive rather than the Ustaše symbols. When he reached Tuzla in central Bosnia, von Krempler met with the militia leader Hadžiefendić. On 28 March, Hadžiefendić escorted von Krempler to Sarajevo, where he introduced him to the leader of Bosnia's Islamic clergy, Hafiz Muhamed Pandža, the \"reis-ul-ulema\", as well as other leading Muslim politicians not involved with the Ustaše. The NDH government and Kasche were furious, demanding von Krempler's immediate removal. The SS ignored the demand and von Krempler continued recruiting, including deserters from the NDH armed forces.\n\nIn March–April 1943, both Himmler and a group of Muslim leaders within the NDH requested that the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, then resident in Berlin, assist in organising and recruiting Muslims into the \"Waffen\"-SS and other units. He was escorted by von Krempler, who spoke Turkish. From 30 March to 10 April, the Mufti visited Zagreb, Sarajevo and Banja Luka to meet senior Muslim leaders and agitate in support of the new division. The Mufti also visited in order to bless and inspect the division. The Mufti insisted, \"The most important task of this division must be to protect the homeland and families [of the Bosnian volunteers]; the division must not be permitted to leave Bosnia\", but the Germans paid no attention.\n\nDespite the support of al-Husseini, recruitment of Muslims for the division fell well short of the numbers needed. Himmler then allowed a 10 percent Christian component, but the recruitment of sufficient Muslims continued to prove difficult, resulting in the induction of 2,800 Catholic Croats into the division. To Himmler's dismay, this was greater than the ratio of Catholics to Muslims that he had wanted.\n\nHussein Biščević (Husejin Biščević or Biščević-beg; born 28 July 1884) was the highest ranking (and perhaps the oldest) Bosnian military officer to volunteer. Bišcević had served in the Austro–Hungarian army and in August 1943 was appointed as an \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" to command the divisional anti-aircraft battalion. He was eventually judged unsuitable, and was replaced with a German just before the division went into combat.\n\nSources differ regarding the division's initial composition. Pavlowitch states that sixty percent of its recruits were Muslims and the rest were Yugoslav \"Volksdeutsche\" who made up the majority of its officers and non-commissioned officers. Tomasevich states that it was formed with 23,200 Muslims and 2,800 Croats, with mostly German officers. He further states it was the largest of the Muslim SS divisions with 26,000 men. Lepre indicates that the division's prescribed strength was reduced from 26,000 to 21,000, and Cohen states that the division achieved a maximum strength of 17,000 in April 1944. The division had a Muslim imam for each battalion other than the all-German signal battalion. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak region who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment, which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28).\n\nBy the time the division had completed its training, it was still about one third below its designated strength in both officers and NCOs, and its officer corps remained almost entirely German. Most of the officers and NCOs were drawn from replacement units of other \"Waffen\"-SS divisions.\n\nThe division was initially sent to southern France for formation and training, where it was accommodated mainly in towns and villages in the Aveyron and Lozère départements. For a long period after its official formation, the division was unnamed and was referred to as the \"Kroatische SS-Freiwilligen-Division\" (Croatian SS-Volunteer Division) or the \"Muselmanen-Division\" (Muslim Division). The decision by the \"Waffen\"-SS to form and train the division outside Bosnia was contrary to advice given by the NDH's German plenipotentiary general, Edmund Glaise von Horstenau. This advice soon proved prophetic.\n\nOn 9 August 1943, \"Oberst\" Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig took command of the division from von Oberwurzer. Sauberzweig transferred to the \"Waffen\"-SS and was appointed to the rank of \"SS-Oberführer\". He was a Prussian who had been decorated as an eighteen-year-old company commander during World War I, and had served as a regimental commander during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa before being wounded. A \"proven leader of men\", he spoke no Serbo-Croatian but quickly gained the lasting respect and affection of the men of the division.\n\nOn the night of 16/17 September 1943, while the 13th SS Division was training in Villefranche-de-Rouergue in France, a group of pro-Partisan soldiers led by Muslim and Catholic junior officers staged a mutiny within the Pioneer battalion. Led by Ferid Džanić, Božo Jelinek (aka Eduard Matutinović), Nikola Vukelić and Lutfija Dizdarević, they captured most of the German personnel and executed five German officers, including battalion commander \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Oskar Kirchbaum. Apparently, the mutineers believed that many of the enlisted men would join them and they could reach the Western Allies.\n\nThe revolt was put down with the assistance of the unit imam, Halim Malkoč, and unit physician Dr. Willfried Schweiger. Malkoč told the Bosnian enlisted men of 1st Company that they were being deceived, released the German NCOs and rallied the company to hunt down the ringleaders. Schweiger did the same with 2nd Company. Dizdarević and Džanić were shot and killed during the fighting, and Vukelić was captured, while Jelinek escaped.\n\nSources vary on the number of mutineers killed after the revolt was suppressed. Tomasevich states that 78 of the worst offenders were executed, but Lepre lists only 14 executions while four more deserters were located and shot in late September. Cohen states that about 150 mutineers were killed immediately, while Noel Malcolm writes that 15 of the mutineers died and a further 141 were killed in a subsequent \"clean-up operation.\" The Germans attributed the infiltration to Tito's suggestion that his Partisan followers enlist for police duty to receive superior weapons, uniforms and training. Enlistees who were deemed \"unsuitable for service\" or \"politically unreliable\" were subsequently purged. Eventually, 825 Bosnians were removed from the division and sent to Germany for labour service with \"Organisation Todt\". Of these, 265 refused and were sent to the Neuengamme concentration camp where dozens of them died.\n\nSpeaking of the Bosnian Muslim troops who had served in the Austro–Hungarian army, Himmler later said, \"I knew there was a chance that a few traitors might be smuggled into the division, but I haven't the slightest doubt concerning the loyalty of the Bosnians. These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago, so why shouldn't they be so today.\" Himmler awarded both Malkoč and Schweiger the Iron Cross Second Class for thwarting the mutiny. Five soldiers were also decorated.\n\nWhen Villefranche-de-Rouergue was liberated in 1944, the local population decided to pay tribute to the mutineers by naming one of its streets \"Avenue des Croates\" (Bosnian Muslims were seen by the local population as Croats of Islamic faith) and commemorating \"the revolt of the Croats\" every 17 September. Cohen states that after the war, the Yugoslav government requested it be changed to \"the revolt of the Yugoslavs\" in order to obscure the mutineers' ethnicity; this request was refused by the French. The Villefranche-de-Rouergue uprising was originally commemorated in the city with a monument designed by Croatian sculptor Vanja Radauš.\n\nAs a result of the mutiny, the division was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, coined the term \"Mujo\" for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an oath of allegiance to both Hitler and Pavelić.\n\nOn 9 October 1943, SS headquarters officially named the division the \"13. SS-Freiwilligen b.h. Gebirgs-Division (Kroatien)\", but a short time later a change was made to differentiate it from those that were composed of Germans and it became the 13th \"Waffen\" Mountain Division of the SS \"Handschar\" (1st Croatian) (, ). The division was named \"Handschar\", after a local fighting knife or sword carried by Turkish policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the Ottoman Empire. On 15 February 1944, the division completed its training and returned to the NDH by rail.\n\nThe division was formed for the primary role of securing around of territory (the designated security zone) in north-eastern Bosnia within the NDH. The security zone encompassed the Posavina, Semberija and Majevica regions between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Spreča rivers. It roughly corresponded with the area of operations of the Partisan 3rd Corps. Himmler saw this task as critical to the safeguarding of important agricultural areas and \"Volksdeutsche\" settlements in the Syrmia region to the north.\n\nThe division participated in what may have been the largest anti-Partisan sweep of World War II: Operation \"Maibaum\". The 13th SS Division also participated in other divisional and corps-sized anti-Partisan operations between March and May 1944.\n\nThe division first saw action during Operation \"Wegweiser\" (Signpost) from 9 to 12 March 1944. The aim of Operation \"Wegweiser\" was to clear a part of the Syrmia region which was occupied by Partisans who threatened the Zagreb-Belgrade railway. The Partisans were operating from forests around Bosut and villages along the Sava. As the division entered the area, the Partisans withdrew to the south-east, avoiding decisive engagement. Sauberzweig claimed the Partisans suffered 573 killed and 82 captured. Hoare writes that the division massacred hundreds of Serb civilians during the operation. According to Vladimir Dedijer and Antun Miletić, 223 civilians were killed in Bosut, 352 in Sremska Rača, and 70 in Jamena, mostly old men, women and children. The operation was a success in clearing the Bosut forests, but the Partisans returned to the area soon after it concluded.\n\nOn 15 March 1944, Operation \"Save\" was launched with the objective of clearing Partisans from the Semberija region. Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division: \"We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will (soon) begin the march into the homeland. ... The Führer has provided you with his best weapons. Not only do you (have these) in your hands, but above all you have an idea in your hearts – to liberate the homeland. ... Before long, each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home, as a soldier and a gentleman; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe – the idea of Adolf Hitler.\"\n\nSauberzweig also ordered that each commander read a prepared message as his unit crossed the Sava River, which emphasised that the \"liberation of Bosnia\" and ultimately the liberation of \"Muslim Albania\" was their goal. This was a direct appeal to the Albanian troops as well as the Bosnians. The 27th Regiment crossed the Sava at dawn at Bosanska Rača near the confluence with the Drina. The rest crossed at Brčko covered by an intense artillery bombardment. Contact was immediately made with Partisan forces, who quickly withdrew into the forests. The service support units remained north of the Sava in Vinkovci, which became their permanent garrison area. The 27th Regiment advanced easily across the Pannonian Plain through Velino Selo to Brodac and then on to Bijeljina which was taken against light Partisan resistance late on 16 March.\n\nThe 27th Regiment then consolidated its position in Bijeljina while the 28th Regiment and the divisional reconnaissance battalion () bore the brunt of the fighting as they advanced through Pukis, Čelić and Koraj at the foot of the Majevica mountains. Sauberzweig later recorded that the 2nd battalion of the 28th Regiment (II/28) \"at Čelić stormed the Partisan defenses with (new) battalion commander Hans Hanke at the point\" and that enemy forces withdrew after a hard battle with heavy losses, low on ammunition.\n\nOnce the area was secured, defensive positions were established along the Čelić–Lopare road and company strength units were sent out to conduct reconnaissance. On the night of 17–18 March, elements of the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division and 36th Vojvodina Division mounted unsuccessful attacks against the 28th Regiment's positions at Koraj and Zabrđe, losing over 200.\n\nAfter Operation \"Save\", the division remained relatively static for more than three weeks, mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on the divisional western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.\n\nOperation \"Osterei\" (Easter Egg) began on 12 April 1944 with the goal of clearing the Majevica mountain, which was held by elements of the 3rd Corps led by General Kosta Nađ. The 27th Regiment quickly captured Janja and drove through Donja Trnova to reach the Ugljevik coal mines, an important economic objective for the German war machine. Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April, the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead, 45 captured and two deserters along with large amounts of weapons and ammunition. The regiment also seized a huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja Trnova.\n\nThe 28th Regiment drove south through Mačkovac and during fighting around Priboj, its 1st Battalion (I/28), made up of Albanians, incurred heavy casualties. The Partisan 3rd Corps then withdrew the 16th and 36th Vojvodina Divisions south across the Tuzla–Zvornik road. The reconnaissance battalion continued the advance, driving into the western Majevicas and capturing Srebrnik and Gradačac then linking up with the Croatian Home Guard 1st Mountain Brigade. The Germans considered Operation \"Osterei\" a major success, achieving all objectives with minimal losses.\n\nDuring the final phase of Operation \"Osterei\", I/28 was withdrawn from the fighting and transferred to Pristina in Kosovo to form part of the 21st \"Waffen\" Mountain Division of the SS \"Skanderbeg\" (1st Albanian) being raised by Himmler's order. A new I/28 was raised from other divisional units and new recruits.\n\nIn the latter part of Operation \"Osterei\", \"Jagdkommandos\", lightly armed and mobile \"hunter teams\" of company or battalion strength, were used to break up and harass Partisans still operating on the flanks. These teams killed over 380 Partisans and captured over 200 between 21 and 23 April. By mid-April, half of the security zone had been cleared of Partisans.\n\nThe ambitious goal of Operation \"Maibaum\" (Maypole) was to destroy the Partisan 3rd Corps. Army Group F ordered V SS Mountain Corps to form a blockade along the Drina to prevent the Partisan force from crossing into Serbia. Operation \"Maibaum\" was one of the largest counter-insurgency operations of World War II and included 7th SS Division and NDH forces. The 13th SS Division was under the command of V SS Corps, and the primary tasks of the division were to capture Tuzla and Zvornik, then drive south parallel with the Drina to meet other Corps elements. The original plan included the parachute insertion of 500th SS Parachute Battalion into the Vlasenica area, but this was cancelled due to unsuitable weather. Flank security was to be provided by the reconnaissance battalion in the Srebrnik area. The deployment south of the Spreča, and therefore outside the security zone, during Operation \"Maibaum\" was ordered by the corps commander, Phleps, despite opposition from Sauberzweig. This caused friction between the two that eventually required Himmler's intervention.\n\nOn 23 April, the 28th Regiment pushed south along mountain roads through Tuzla. The following day it continued on as far as Stupari. On 25 April, the 27th Regiment advanced south to capture Zvornik. At the same time, the 28th Regiment sent I/28 east towards Vlasenica and II/28 continuing south towards Kladanj, capturing the town on 27 April. Due to the level of the Drinjača at Kladanj, instead of fording the river and pushing east towards Vlasenica, II/28 continued south-east towards Han Pijesak, where they met elements of 7th SS Division advancing north.\n\nI/28 captured Vlasenica on 28 April, but was almost immediately attacked from the east by two Partisan divisions. A third Partisan division surrounded the headquarters of 28th Regiment at Šekovići, 30 kilometres north-west of Vlasenica. Both II/28 and the reconnaissance battalion were rushed to Vlasenica, where II/28 relieved the battered I/28 and then surrounded Šekovići. After a 48-hour battle, during which II/28 was decimated, the town was taken.\n\nWhile the battle of Šekovići raged, the 27th Regiment extended the Drina blockade further south, ambushing a Partisan column and reaching Nova Kasaba on 30 April. After the situation at Šekovići improved on 1 May, the 27th Regiment returned to patrolling the Tuzla–Zvornik road. The 28th Regiment moved to the Simin Han-Lopare area on 5 May, while the 7th SS Division pursued the Partisans withdrawing south.\n\nOperation \"Maibaum\" had not only stopped the Partisan 3rd Corps from crossing the Drina into Serbia, it had scattered the Partisan formation. On 6 May, V SS Mountain Corps ordered the division to return to the security zone north of the Spreča.\n\nOn 17–18 May 1944, the division, along with the local Majevica-Tuzla Chetnik unit commanded by Radivoj Kerović, commenced Operation \"Maiglöckchen\" (May Bell) to destroy several Partisan brigades in the Majevicas. The Partisans were encircled in the Stolice heights. An attempt by the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division to relieve the surrounded force was defeated by the reconnaissance battalion and elements of the 28th Regiment. The relieving column was driven back across the Spreća. After heavy bombardment by the artillery regiment, the trapped Partisan force escaped south out of the pocket under cover of darkness on 18 May. The Partisans suffered considerable casualties, for example the 17th Majevica Brigade of the 27th East Bosnia Division lost 16 killed and 60 missing. At the conclusion of Operation \"Maiglöckchen\", the 27th Regiment remained near Zvornik and the 28th Regiment deployed near Srebrenik.\n\nAfter Operation \"Maiglöckchen\", the division shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans access to the security zone. Since its arrival in the zone the division had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's \"Zeleni kadar\" (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.\n\nFollowing Operation \"Rösselsprung\" (Knight's Move), the German attempt to kill or capture Tito at Drvar in western Bosnia on 25 May 1944, the Partisan leader ordered a general uprising. The Partisan 3rd Corps planned an offensive that involved three parallel columns of divisional strength thrusting north into the zone to engage and destroy German and local allied forces. The columns comprised:\n\nOperation \"Vollmond\" (Full Moon) was devised quickly after the reconnaissance battalion observed Partisan forces crossing the Tuzla–Zvornik road on the evening of 6 June 1944. Sauberzweig's aim was to assault from the east and north, pushing the advancing Partisan forces against the Drina. The German plan underestimated the strength of the Partisan \"Western Column\" and had placed only one battalion (I/28) on high ground in the Partisans' path. This battalion included many raw recruits, and was protecting two batteries of the artillery regiment, one of which (7/AR13) was deployed just east of Lopare.\n\nLate on 7 June, the Partisans scattered I/28 and although II/28 was sent from Srebrenik to assist, the 16th Vojvodina Division surged forward against the positions of 7/AR13, which consisted of 80 men with four 150 mm guns and only one machine gun. After four hours fighting, and with half the battery's personnel dead, the artillerymen ran out of small arms ammunition and scattered into the forest. As a result of a counterattack by II/28 on the afternoon of 9 June and throughout 10 June, the 16th Vojvodina Division withdrew that afternoon and the battalion pursued both the \"Western Column\" and \"Centre Column\" south. The guns and vehicles of 7/AR13 had been destroyed by the Partisans before they withdrew and there were reports that the German dead at Lopare had been mutilated. The \"Eastern Column\" was stopped by the 27th Regiment and the last of the Partisan 3rd Corps was pushed back across the Spreča on 12 June.\n\nAccording to German accounts, Operation \"Vollmond\" cost the division 205 dead, 528 wounded and 89 missing. I/28 had been decimated, with only 180 men remaining. Sauberzweig claimed 3,000 Partisans were killed in this operation, but Phleps dismissed this as \"a large exaggeration\". According to one German after-action report, they had killed over 1,500 Partisans and captured large amounts of arms and ammunition. According to Partisan sources, the losses of the Partisan 3rd Corps were:\n\nAt the conclusion of Operation \"Vollmond\", the commander of the 27th Regiment, Desiderius Hampel, was appointed division commander at his substantive rank of \"Standartenführer\" and Sauberzweig was tasked with forming a new corps headquarters, the IX \"Waffen\" Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian). The commander of the 28th Regiment, Helmuth Raithel, was tasked to raise the new 23rd \"Waffen\" Mountain Division of the SS \"Kama\" (2nd Croatian). Both the new corps headquarters and new division were to be formed in southern Hungary. Three NCOs from every company of 13th SS Division, along with other personnel, were transferred to form the core of 23rd SS Division. New commanders were appointed to the two mountain infantry regiments, notably Hanke to the 28th.\n\nSoon after Hampel's assumption of command, he became aware that local Chetniks were scavenging the Operation \"Vollmond\" battlefields for divisional equipment. He met with the Chetnik leader Kerović and arranged for the return of the equipment in exchange for small arms ammunition and boxes of hand grenades.\n\nThroughout the remainder of June 1944 and into the first week of July, the division was engaged in fighting off attempted Partisan incursions into the security zone and reinforcing local NDH and Chetniks who were under attack from the Partisans. During the summer of 1944, elements of the division were tasked with guarding Hungarian Jewish forced labourers building fortifications in Tuzla. While guarding the labourers, they subjected them to cruel treatment, and shot 22 who were unable to continue working.\n\nOperation \"Fliegenfänger\" (Flypaper) was launched on 14 July 1944. It aimed to destroy a makeshift Partisan runway in the Osmaci area about southeast of Tuzla, south of the Tuzla–Zvornik road and the Partisan forces guarding it. The airstrip was just north of the southern boundary of the security zone and was being used by Allied aircraft to bring in supplies and evacuate wounded Partisans to Italy. It had been built by the 19th Birač Brigade of the 27th East Bosnia Division between 3 and 6 July, and the first flight into the airfield occurred on the night of 6/7 July. The 19th Birač Brigade was also responsible for its defence. Two battalions of the 27th Regiment, along with a battalion of Chetniks from Majevica launched the operation from the line of Caparde–Memići–Prnjavor, and captured the towns of Osmaci and Memići and damaged the airfield despite stiff resistance. That afternoon, the 19th Birač Brigade counter-attacked and pushed the German and Chetniks back across the Tuzla–Zvornik road. At the same time as the counter-attack was underway, the headquarters of the Partisan 3rd Corps ordered the 36th Vojvodina Division to clear the enemy from the area so that the airfield could be used. During the night of 14/15 July, elements of the 36th Vojvodina Division arrived in the Osmaci area and relieved the 19th Birač Brigade, which moved towards Srebrenica. During the night of 16/17 July, Allied aircraft delivered equipment to Osmaci and about 100 wounded Partisans were airlifted to Italy.\n\nAccording to German reports, 42 Partisans were killed, while the division's losses were four dead and seven wounded. The Partisan force withdrew south to the Vlasenica–Rajići area. The cooperation with the Chetnik battalion was described in the IX SS Mountain Corps war diary as \"effective\".\n\nWhile the division was conducting Operation \"Fliegenfänger\", the Second Panzer Army was developing a plan to block a large Partisan force from moving from central Bosnia into western Serbia to reinforce the Partisans. Due to issues with the availability of various units of V SS Mountain Corps, the planned Operation \"Rose\" was cancelled.\n\nIn the interim, since most of the division was deployed in the southern part of the security zone, Hampel planned a divisional-level operation, named Operation \"Heiderose\" (Wild Rose) targeting Partisan positions north-west of Šekovići, south of the Spreča. The 27th Regiment, reinforced by the same Chetnik battalion that cooperated in Operation \"Fliegenfänger\", would attack east towards Šekovići and the 28th Regiment would push south. A detached battalion of 7th SS Division would act as a blocking force driving north. Hampel was apparently unhappy with the performance of the new commander of the 27th Regiment (\"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Hermann Peter) and put the divisional chief of staff, \"SS-Sturmbannführer\" Erich Braun, in charge of the 27th Regiment.\n\nOn 17 July, the operation began. Fierce resistance was immediately encountered by the 28th Regiment, while the 27th Regiment climbed the heights to Udrč before dusk without serious opposition. Early on 18 July, the Chetniks attacked from Matkovac towards Šekovići. The 27th Regiment reached Bačkovac and seized the high ground south of Šekovići on 19 July 1944. The 28th Regiment forced the Partisan 36th Vojvodina Division back. The battalion from 7th SS Division encountered serious resistance around Vlasenica but pushed through. On 19 July, the 28th Regiment drove north towards Gornje Petrovice to attack the Partisan 12th Corps at Živinice. The reconnaissance battalion of 7th SS Division pushed in from Vareš as a blocking force to stop the Partisans from withdrawing via Kladanj.\n\nThe Partisans then committed the 16th Vojvodina Division to assist the 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation \"Heiderose\" to this point. On 20 July, both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment, which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began to search for the hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence had indicated were located there. After a day of searching, the division uncovered more than ten Partisan bases, which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans in previous days.\n\nOperation \"Heiderose\" was a significant success for the division, inflicting serious losses on the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and a large amount of equipment was captured: one anti-tank gun, two mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses, with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead, wounded and missing. However, Partisan reports estimate that German losses were significantly larger than their own. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division's formation.\n\nIn the first week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, originally planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation \"Rübezahl\" (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation \"Hackfleisch\" (Minced Meat). \"Hackfleisch\" aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.\n\nThe columns were allocated tasks and composed as follows:\n\nThe 27th Regiment became locked in fierce fighting with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The inability of the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east. Other Partisan forces withdrew in the direction of Goražde.\n\nAs far as the Germans were concerned, Operation \"Hackfleisch\" was a moderate success, with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken. It delayed, but did not prevent, the Partisans' advance into Serbia. In order to allow the 7th SS Division to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central Bosnia, both I/28 and III/28 were placed under the command of that division for the period of 8–17 August 1944. During the remainder of August 1944, the rump of the division fought hard to keep the Partisans out of the security zone. The Partisan 11th Krajina Division and 38th Bosnia Division quickly infiltrated into the southern part of the security zone and the 27th East Bosnia Division crossed into the area north-west of Srebrenica and drove towards Bratunac. After a series of rapid redeployments and battalion and regimental attacks, the division scattered the 11th Krajina Division and mauled the 27th East Bosnia Division.\n\nThe division had by now been fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, it had been exhausted even before Operation \"Hackfleisch\" began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.\n\nIn early September 1944, the division returned north to the security zone, basing the infantry battalions in the villages of Kurukaja, Vukovije (south of Foča), Osmaci and Srebrnik. Almost immediately, the Partisan 3rd Corps commenced an offensive, attacking II/28 at Srebrnik. It held on despite being pressed hard during two days of fighting against the 11th Krajina Division. By the end of the first week in September, divisional supply columns were being attacked by Chetniks, sensing German weakness and looking for arms and supplies. Three members of the division were killed in these attacks. Over the same week, the Allies conducted Operation Ratweek throughout the Balkans, which involved Allied air power pounding Axis troop concentrations and key infrastructure in order to impede the German withdrawal from Greece. The local effect was to complicate the division's logistics through destruction of the Sarajevo-Brod railway and mass desertions of NDH troops tasked with securing supply lines.\n\nOn 8 September, II/27 was assaulted unsuccessfully by the Partisans at Matkovac. After the first week of September, most of the division's fighting power was shifted to the western boundary of the security zone to meet Partisan incursions. The division succeeded in dislodging Partisan units from Slatna and Međeđa and allied Chetniks captured Skurgić. After relief by NDH forces, the division's fighting regiments withdrew to Brčko for rest and refit. As a result of the shift to the western area of the security zone, the zone's southern area was quickly overrun by Partisan forces. Zvornik and Tuzla had fallen by mid-September.\n\nOn 17 August 1944, Tito offered a general amnesty and many in the division took advantage of this opportunity. During the first three weeks of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. They went home, joined the Green Cadres militia or went over to the Ustaše. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined the Partisan 3rd Corps by early October.\n\nDue to high rates of desertion from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.\n\nIn the early morning of 3 October 1944, the Partisan 28th Slavonia Division assaulted a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at Janja close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone. As they broke out of the encirclement to the north, the rest of the reconnaissance battalion drove south from Bijeljina and stopped the Partisan advance at heavy cost. Rushing towards Janja from the east, III/27 came into contact with Partisans around Modran, reaching the Janja garrison at 10 pm that night and received artillery reinforcement by 3/AR 13 during the night. At dawn the following day, an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja, with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south. \"Jagdkommandos\" were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses on them as they had already crossed the Drina into the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Following this battle, Army Group F concluded that the division's overall combat value was minimal.\n\nA few days later, the 9th Company of the 28th Regiment (9/28) displayed what could still be achieved by the Bosnians under determined leadership when \"Leutnant\" Hans König ambushed the Partisan 17th Majevica Brigade near Vukosavci, killing at least 67 and capturing orders for future operations. König was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership.\n\nWhile 9/28 was fighting near Vukosavci, a number of units, consisting mainly of artillery, were temporarily detached for duty with other formations of Second Panzer Army fighting Soviet troops within the German-occupied territory of Serbia. The division was not re-united until January 1945.\n\nAfter a request from Army Group F to Himmler, a decision was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: the Bosnians were very reluctant to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.\n\nOn 20 October, the Red Army and Partisan forces captured Belgrade and the following day the divisional staff imam, Abdulah Muhasilović, incited a mutiny and led 100 men back to Bosnia. Himmler finally agreed to the disarming of the \"unreliable\" Bosnians under Operation \"Herbstlaub\" (Autumn Leaves) on 25 October. Between 900 and 1,000 Bosnians in the Brčko bridgehead and over 2,300 in Zagreb were allocated to labour battalions and similar non-combatant auxiliary duties, although the disarming operation was not completed in the Zagreb area until mid-November. By the beginning of November the division, which had been ninety five percent non-German in January 1944, became fifty percent German. The plans to re-organise the division were abandoned and Sauberzweig was relieved of command. In addition, Sauberzweig's IX SS Mountain Corps staff was dissolved and the remnants were placed under the command of LXVIII Army Corps, under which they remained for the rest of the war.\n\nMeanwhile, the advance of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the formerly Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav region of Baranja made holding the line of the Danube critical for the Germans. In early November the Soviet troops established a bridgehead over the Danube from Apatin (in modern-day Serbia). From 9 November onward, the division was committed in several stages to the Eastern Front, starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at Dárda west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November. They were followed by a grouping of three battalions (I/27, II/28 and II/28), an artillery battalion (III/AR 13) and pioneer support. Known as \"Kampfgruppe Hanke\" after their commander Hans Hanke, they moved from the Brčko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at Pélmonostor on 14 November south-west of a second Soviet bridgehead that had been established at Batina (in modern-day Croatia). As a result, the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion, which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina. The following day \"Kampfgruppe Hanke\" was driven out of its positions, when the remaining 200 troops withdrew. By 25 November the rest of the division was on its way from the Zagreb area. The remnants of \"Kampfgruppe Hanke\" were placed under command of \"Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister\", withdrawing as far as Siklós in southern Hungary by 29 November.\n\nWithin days \"Kampfgruppe Hanke\" was withdrawn from the front line to rejoin the division and re-fit, and they were moved to Barcs on the Drava river for that purpose. On 2 December the division was reunited, except for the rest of the pioneer battalion, which remained stranded in Bosnia by damaged bridges and railways. As a result of continued desertions and the catastrophic casualties suffered by \"Kampfgruppe Hanke\", the division retained little of its original Bosnian character. Despite the return of disarmed Bosnians from labour units, the attachment of Hungarian infantry and artillery units and arrival of German replacements meant the division looked little different from any other unit in the Second Panzer Army.\n\nAfter a short break, the division was allocated to a sector of the Margarethe Line, a series of fixed defensive works south of Lake Balaton which held up the Soviet advance. After several Red Army assaults were repulsed, static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945. In early March 1945, a few units took part in Operation Frühlingserwachen (Spring Awakening), which was to be Germany's last major offensive. Meanwhile, from December 1944 to March 1945, the rest of the division remained at Barcs rebuilding. In February, they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion, which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia. On 16 March, the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive, bypassing the Barcs area. That night, the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at Heresznye, where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war.\n\nOn 29 March, the Soviet 57th Army and the Bulgarian First Army assaulted the entire Second Panzer Army front, quickly breaching the line near Nagybajom. The division, holding positions just south of the penetration, began to withdraw to the north-west. It fell back to the Mura and barely managed to cross under constant air and ground attacks, with grievous casualties. Unable to take up effective positions, the division crossed the Reich frontier on 6 April and took up positions at Pettau in the so-called \"Reich Defence Line\", where it remained until 5 May. Its last fighting was around Kiesmanndorff on 19 April.\n\nOn 5 May, the division's remaining men, both German and Bosnian, began to retreat northwards towards Austria. On 8 May, an order was sent to retreat to Wolfsberg, Carinthia. On learning of the orders, unit imams of the 28th Regiment \"approached their commander, Hans Hanke and requested that they and their men be discharged and be allowed to attempt to return to their homeland ... Soon, all of the Bosnians remaining in the division were asked if they wished to remain.\" There are two reports of large-scale reprisal killings of these members of the division by the Partisans, one of which included the mass shooting of 1,400 soldiers.\n\nThe retreat continued until 11 May. On 12 May, Hampel carried out surrender negotiations with the British Army at Sankt Veit an der Glan. On 15 May most of the men were transported to Rimini in Italy, where they were incarcerated with other prisoners of war from 7th SS Division and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their SS blood group tattoo. Hampel escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.\n\nWhile it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by the spring and summer of 1944.\n\nThirty-eight members of the division were extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial following the war. Some committed suicide, including \"Generalleutnant\" Sauberzweig on 20 October 1946 and \"SS-Obersturmführer\" Hans König. Trials took place at a military court in Sarajevo between 22 and 30 August 1947. Only seven of the 38 defendants were charged with specific offenses, although the indictment accused the division of murdering some 5,000 people. The accused were defended by three Yugoslav lawyers: two civilian and one military officer. All were found guilty; 10 were sentenced to death, and 28 received prison terms of between five years and life. \"SS-Obersturmführer\" Imam Halim Malkoč had already been executed in Bihać on 7 March 1947. All of those who were executed were junior officers and non-commissioned officers. Almost all the prisoners were released early and by 1952 all had been freed, except for one who had died. Having escaped, Hampel never faced trial and lived in Graz, Austria until his death on 11 January 1981.\n\nHundreds of members of the 13th and 23rd SS Divisions volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. The Syrian government made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle there. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion.\n\nThe following officers commanded the division. The first two raised and trained the division in its early stages of development and Sauberzweig and Hampel commanded it on active operations against the Partisans and later against the Red Army and Bulgarians:\n\nSeveral members were decorated with high German military awards, with five awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (including Hampel and Hanke), five awarded the German Cross in Gold (including Hanke) and one awarded the German Cross in Silver. All five presentations of the Knight's Cross to members of the division are disputed and cannot be verified at the German National Archive. According to Gerhard von Seemen, Hampel, Karl Liecke and Hanke presumably received the Knight's Cross on the same day from the commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, \"General der Artillerie\" Maximilian de Angelis.\n\n\nFrom 24 September 1944, the supply and logistics battalions were combined to form the 13th SS Service Support/Supply Regiment.\n\nThe uniform was regular SS M43 field-jacket issue, with a divisional collar patch showing an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. On the left arm was a Croatian armshield (red-white chessboard) and on the right an Edelweiss flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them. Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a Sig Rune badge that was attached to the left breast pocket of the tunic.\n\nHeadgear was either the SS M43 fez which was to be worn by all ranks, while German officers had the option to wear the mountain cap (\"Bergmütze\"). The fez was chosen by Himmler because it had been worn by the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry regiments of the Austro-Hungarian army from 1894 to 1918, as well as by the Austro-Hungarian Albanian Legion from 1916 to 1918. There were two versions of the fez: a field gray model to be worn in combat and while on duty and a red model for parades, marching exercises and while off duty. Both the fez and mountain cap bore the death's head and eagle of the SS. The mountain cap was also adorned with an Edelweiss flower patch, worn on the left side of the cap.\n\nSet to the melody of \"Wir fahren gegen Engelland\" by Herms Niel.\n\n\n\n"}

He is referred to as being one of the founders of modern rocketry and astronautics, along with the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the German Hermann Oberth, and the American Robert H. Goddard.\n\nHe was born on November 8, 1881 in Paris to a textile industrialist. He was educated at the \"Faculté des Sciences\", studying engineering at the Sorbonne.\n\nHe served in World War I and was made an \"Officier de la Légion d'Honneur\".\n\nIn November, 1928, on board the \"Ile de France\" while sailing to New York City, he was married to Carmen Bernaldo de Quirós, the daughter of Don Antonio and Yvonne Cabarrus, and granddaughter of General Marquis of Santiago, Grandee of Spain, Head of the Military Household of Queen Isabella II.\n\nHe died on December 6, 1957 in Nice, France.\n\nEsnault-Pelterie developed and manufactured aeroplanes and aero engines under the name REP.\n\nHis first experiments in aviation were based on the Wright brothers 1902 glider. His first glider design was tested on a beach near Calais, but was not successful. His glider was based upon an incomplete understanding of the Wright glider, and although using a version of the wing-warping which the Wright brothers had used to control their aircraft this did not work properly and was abandoned, since he considered it dangerous. After condemning the Wright brothers' approach, he developed the concept of the aileron, fitting a pair of mid-gap control surfaces in front of the wings.\nIn 1906 he began his first experiments in towed flight. On 19 September 1906 he flew . He made his first powered flight on October 10, 1907, a distance of with the REP 1. This was driven by a seven-cylinder, 30 hp air-cooled engine of his own design.\n\nTrials of the monoplane REP 2 began on June 8, 1908. This aircraft set a record with a flight, reaching an altitude of . After a modified version of this plane was flown for the last time in 1909 at Rheims, Pelterie stopped flying and instead focused on the development and manufacture of aircraft.\n\nThe Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane was based upon his designs, and marked the beginning of aircraft production at the later Vickers Limited. In 1912 he introduced the REP Type N and in 1914 the REP Parasol monoplane.\n\nHis family had invested heavily to fund his aircraft designs, and this had left them nearly financially ruined. However, he was the inventor of the \"joystick\" flight control, and owned a patent on the design. Following the war he was involved in litigation over his joystick patent. Many aircraft built during the war had used this design and the aircraft companies owed him royalties. The damages he won and subsequent royalties made him a wealthy man. This also allowed him to repay his father's significant investment.\n\nEsnault-Pelterie designed and built his own aero engines. He also sold them under the name R.E.P. They were all of an unusual multiple-banked fan or half-radial type. The first design featured seven cylinders double-banked, with four in one bank and three in the other, and was rated at . A later model doubled them up to create a 14 cylinder quadruple-banked engine giving .\n\nHe became interested in space travel, and, not knowing of Tsiolkovsky's 1903 work, in 1913 produced a paper that presented the rocket equation and calculated the energies required to reach the Moon and nearby planets. In this talk, he proposed the use of atomic energy, using 400 kg of radium to power an interplanetary vehicle. His culminating work was \"L'Astronautique\", published in 1930. A later version published in 1934 included details on interplanetary travel and applications of nuclear power.\n\nOn June 8, 1927, Esnault-Pelterie gave a symposium for the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) titled \"L'exploration par fusées de la très haute atmosphère et la possibilité des voyages interplanétaires\", concerning the exploration of outer space using rocket propulsion. Jean-Jacques Barré attended this lecture, and developed a correspondence with Esnault-Pelterie on the topic of rockets.\n\nIn 1929 Esnault-Pelterie proposed the idea of the ballistic missile for military bombardment. By 1930, Esnault-Pelterie and Barré had persuaded the French War Department to fund a study of the concept. In 1931, the two began experimenting with various types of rocket propulsion systems, including liquid propellants. The same year he ran a demonstration of a rocket engine powered with gasoline and liquid oxygen. During an experiment with a rocket design using tetra-nitromethane he lost four fingers from his right hand during an explosion. Ultimately, their work failed to create an interest in rocketry within France.\n\nThe \"Prix REP-Hirsch\" was an international award of the Société astronomique de France given in recognition of the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics. Established by Esnault-Pelterie and André-Louis Hirsch, a Parisian banker and science enthusiast, it was the first prize for astronautics in the world. The award was given \"to recognize the best original scientific work, theoretical or experimental, that is able to advance one of the questions related to the realisation of space travel, or to increase human understanding of one of the branches related to the science of astronautics.\" The idea for establishing the prize originated during a dinner Hirsch and Esnault-Pelterie organised in Paris on 26 December 1927. The guests discussed the emerging science of space travel, which they called “astronautics” at the suggestion of science fiction writer J.H. Rosny the elder. Hirsch and Esnault-Pelterie provided funds – 5,000 francs annually for 1928, 1929, and 1930 – to the Société astronomique de France, for an annual award in astronautics in their names. A Comité d'Astronautique was established to manage the prize. In addition to Esnault-Pelterie, Hirsch, and Rosny the elder, it included General Gustave-Auguste Ferrié (President), Jean Perrin and (Vice-Presidents) and other expert members. The prize was awarded for 10 years. In 1936, the name of the award changed from the \"Prix REP-Hirsch\" to the \"Prix International d'Astronautique\" (International Astronautics Prize).\nThe laureates were:\nThough the award was short-lived, it helped stimulate interest in the new science of astronautics and encouraged early pioneers in the field.\n\nAmong his interests were horseback riding, playing golf, camping and driving cars. During his lifetime he filed about 120 patents in a variety of fields ranging from metallurgy to automobile suspension. He was the inventor of the \"center stick\" aircraft control and of a new type of fuel pump. He also developed the idea of rocket maneuver by means of vectored thrust.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although osteoclasts are active during the natural formation of healthy bone the term \"osteolysis\" specifically refers to a pathological process. Osteolysis often occurs in the proximity of a prosthesis that causes either an immunological response or changes in the bone's structural load. Osteolysis may also be caused by pathologies like bone tumors, cysts, or chronic inflammation.\n\nWhile bone resorption is commonly associated with many diseases or joint problems, the term \"osteolysis\" generally refers to a problem common to artificial joint replacements such as total hip replacements, total knee replacements and total shoulder replacements. Osteolysis can also be associated with the radiographic changes seen in those with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.\n\nThere are several biological mechanisms which may lead to osteolysis. In total hip replacement, the generally accepted explanation for osteolysis involves wear particles (worn off the contact surface of the artificial ball and socket joint). As the body attempts to clean up these wear particles (typically consisting of plastic or metal), it triggers an autoimmune reaction which causes resorption of living bone tissue. Osteolysis has been reported to occur as early as 12 months after implantation and is usually progressive. This may require a revision surgery (replacement of the prosthesis).\n\nAlthough osteolysis itself is clinically asymptomatic, it can lead to implant loosening or bone breakage, which in turn causes serious medical problems.\n\nDistal clavicular osteolysis (DCO) is often associated with problems weightlifters have with their acromioclavicular joints due to high stresses put on the clavicle as it meets with the acromion. This condition is often referred to as \"weight lifter's shoulder\". Medical ultrasonography readily depicts resorption of the distal clavicle as irregular cortical erosions, whereas the acromion remains intact. Associated findings may include distended joint capsule, soft-tissue swelling, and joint instability.\n\nA common surgery to treat recalcitrant DCO is re-sectioning of the distal clavicle, removing a few millimetres of bone from the very end of the bone.\n\n"}

Today the Gros Ventre people are enrolled in the Fort Belknap Indian Community of the Fort Belknap Reservation of Montana, a federally recognized tribe with 3,682 enrolled members, that also includes Assiniboine people or Nakoda people, the Gros Ventre's historical enemies. The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation is in the northernmost part of Montana, just south of the small town of Harlem, Montana.\n\nThe tribal self-name \"ʔɔʔɔɔ̋ɔ́niinénnɔh\" (also: A'aninin, Aaniiih, or Haaninin) means \"White Clay People\".\n\nThe French used the term \"Gros Ventre\", which was mistakenly interpreted from their sign language. They were once known as the Gros Ventres of the Prairies, while the Hidatsa people were once called the Gros Ventres of the Missouri.\n\nThe Piegan Blackfoot, enemies of the Gros Ventre throughout most of history, called the Aaniiih, \"Piik-siik-sii-naa\", which translates as \"snakes\". According to the Piegan Institute, the contemporary Piegan name for the Gros Ventre is \"Assinee\", meaning \"big bellies\", which is similar to the falsely translated label applied by the French. \"Atsina\", a Pieagan word, translates to either \"gut people\" or \"like a Cree\". Further clarification of the name is required. After the division of peoples, their relations the Arapaho, who considered them inferior, called them \"Hitúnĕna\", meaning \"beggars\". Other interpretations of the term have been \"hunger\", \"waterfall\", and \"big bellies\".\n\nThe Gros Ventres are believed to have lived in the western Great Lakes region 3000 years ago, where they lived an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating maize. With the ancestors of the Arapaho, they formed a single, large Algonquian-speaking people who lived along the Red River valley in northern present-day Minnesota and in Manitoba, Canada. They were closely associated with the ancestors of the Cheyenne. They spoke the now nearly extinct Gros Ventre language (Atsina), a similar Plains Algonquian language like their kin the Arapaho and grouped therefore as an Arapahoan language (Arapaho-Atsina). There is evidence that, together with bands of Northern Arapaho, a southern tribal group, the \"Staetan\", spoke the Besawunena dialect, which had speakers among the Northern Arapaho as recently as the late 1920s.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the large tribe split into two, forming the Gros Ventres and the Arapaho. These, with the Cheyenne, were among the last to migrate into Montana, due to pressure from the Ojibwe. After they migrated to Montana, the Arapaho moved southwards to the Wyoming and Colorado area. The Cheyenne who migrated with the Gros Ventre and Arapaho also migrated onwards. The Gros Ventres were reported living in two north-south tribal groups - the so-called \"Fall Indians\" (Canadian or northern group) of 260 tipis (2,500 population) traded with the North West Company on the Upper Saskatchewan River and roamed between the Missouri and Bow River, and the so-called \"Staetan tribe\" (American or southern group) of 40 tipis (400 population) living in close contact with bands (which would become the later Northern Arapaho) and roamed the headwaters of the Loup branch of the North Platte River (Lewis and Clark 1806).\n\nThe Gros Ventres acquired horses in the mid-18th century. The earliest known contact of Gros Ventres with whites was around 1754, between the north and south forks of the Saskatchewan River. Exposure to smallpox severely reduced their numbers about this time. Around 1793, in response to attacks by well-armed Cree and Assiniboines, large groups of Gros Ventres burned two Hudson's Bay Company trading posts that were providing guns to the Cree and Assiniboine tribes in what is now Saskatchewan.\n\nIn 1832, the Gros Ventres made contact with the German explorer and naturalist, Prince Maximilian. Along with the naturalist painter Karl Bodmer, the Europeans painted portraits and recorded their meeting with the Gros Ventres, near the Missouri River in Montana.\n\nThe Gros Ventres joined the Blackfoot Confederacy. After allying with the Blackfoot, the Gros Ventres moved to north-central Montana and southern Canada. In 1855, Isaac Stevens, Governor of the Washington Territory, concluded a treaty (Stat., L., XI, 657) to provide peace between the United States and the Blackfoot, Flathead and Nez Perce tribes. The Gros Ventres signed the treaty as part of the Blackfoot Confederacy, whose territory near the Three Fork area became a common hunting ground for the Flathead, Nez Perce, Kootenai, and Crow Indians. A common hunting ground north of the Missouri River on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation included the Assiniboine and Sioux. In 1861, the Gros Ventres left the Blackfoot Confederacy.\n\nAllying with the Crow, the Gros Ventres fought the Blackfoot but in 1867, they were defeated.\n\nIn 1868, the United States government established a trading post called Fort Browning near the mouth of Peoples Creek on the Milk River. This trading post was built for the Gros Ventres and Assiniboines, but because it was on a favorite hunting ground of the Sioux, it was abandoned in 1871. The government then built Fort Belknap, which was established on the south side of the Milk River, about one mile southwest of the present town site of Harlem, Montana. Fort Belknap was a substation post, with half of the structure being a trading post. A block house stood to the left of the stockade gate. At the right was a warehouse and an issue building, where the tribe received their rations and annuity goods.\n\nIn 1876, the fort was discontinued and the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine people receiving annuities at the post were instructed to go to the agency at Fort Peck and Wolf Point. The Assiniboines did not object to going to Wolf Point and readily went about moving; but the Gros Ventres refused to go. If they did, they would come into contact with the Sioux, with whom they could not ride together in peace. They forfeited their annuities rather than move to Fort Peck. In 1878, the Fort Belknap Agency was re-established, and the Gros Ventres, and remaining Assiniboines were again allowed to receive supplies at Fort Belknap.\n\nWhite Eagle, \"the last major Chief of the Gros Ventre people\", died \"at the mouth of the Judith River\" on February 9, 1881.\nIn 1884, gold was discovered in the Little Rocky Mountains. Pressure from miners and mining companies forced the tribes to cede sections of the mountains in 1885. Jesuits came to Fort Belknap in 1862 to convert the Gros Ventre people to Roman Catholicism. In 1887, St. Paul's Mission was established at the foot of the Little Rocky Mountains, near Hays. Much of the traditional ceremonies were lost through the course of time following the establishment of the mission. However, the two sacred pipes, The Feathered Pipe and The Flat Pipe, remain central to the traditional spiritual beliefs of the Gros Ventres.\n\nIn 1888, at this site, the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation was established. By an act of Congress on May 1, 1888, (Stat., L., XXV, 113), the Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, and Assiniboine tribes ceded 17,500,000 acres of their joint reservation and agreed to live on three smaller reservations. These are now known as the Blackfoot Confederacy, the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation. Fort Belknap was named for William W. Belknap, who was Secretary of War at that time.\n\nBy 1904, there were only 535 A'ani tribe members remaining. Since then, the tribe has revived, with a substantial increase in population.\n\nIn March 2012, 63 American bison from Yellowstone National Park were transferred to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation prairie, to be released to a 2,100-acre game preserve 25 miles north of Poplar. There are many other bison herds outside Yellowstone, but this is one of the very few genetically pure ones, not cross-bred with cattle. Native Americans celebrated the move, which came over a century after bison were nearly wiped out by hunters and the government. The Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes at the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation will also receive a portion of this herd.\nHistorically, Gros Ventres had twelve independent bands, each governed by a chief. The current reservation government has an elected council, which includes four officers, as well as four members from each tribe. Today, the tribe belongs to the Fort Belknap Indian Community, whose constitution and by-laws were ratified in 1935. The tribal council has six elected Gros Ventre members, as well as six elected Assiniboine members, and three appointed members.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company is the largest television station owner in the United States, owning 197 television stations across the U.S., most of which are affiliates with the four \"major\" U.S. television networks located in small to medium-sized markets. It also operates all of the stations owned by an affiliated company, Mission Broadcasting, under local marketing agreements.\n\nThe Nexstar Media Group was founded as the Nexstar Broadcasting Group on June 17, 1996. The first television station bought by Nexstar was WYOU in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Nexstar bought WYOU from Diversified Communications. The sale was completed on September 28 of that year. Nexstar promptly fired two beloved anchors and laid off several long-term staff members. Nexstar founder Perry Sook said that WYOU would be Nexstar's flagship station, keeping an office off the newsroom for years. In 1998, Nexstar purchased WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Because this was in the same market as WYOU, WYOU was 'sold' to Mission Broadcasting. This began the first ever 'shared-services' agreement between stations. WYOU's sales staff was kept in Scranton while the production and news operations were moved to WBRE's offices in Wilkes-Barre. WYOU's staff who were not laid off were fired by Nexstar, hired by Mission and eventually rehired by Nexstar. Mission Broadcasting then paid Nexstar to operate and control the production and newsgathering operations while Mission kept the sales and management team.\n\nIn 2003, Nexstar acquired Quorum Broadcasting (owner of 10 television stations).\n\nOn March 20, 2009, Nexstar operated television stations that were owned by Four Points Media Group, through an outsourcing agreement. However, on September 8, 2011, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intent of purchasing the Four Points stations outright and took over the MSA for the stations that October upon Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval of the deal (the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave final approval of the group deal on December 21, and the Sinclair purchase of the Four Points stations was completed on January 1, 2012).\n\nIn 2011, Nexstar and Fox entered into a dispute over terms of reverse compensation; this occurred as Fox began to aggressively seek shares of earnings from retransmission consent agreements with cable and satellite operators as part of affiliation agreement renewals between station groups with affiliates whose affiliation contracts already expired (and carrying the network's programming without a contractual agreement) or were near expiration. Reportedly, the amount from retransmission consent fees from cable and satellite operators that Fox wanted its affiliates to pay the network would be 25 cents per subscriber during the first year of the affiliation agreement, increasing to 50 cents by the fourth year. President of affiliate sales and marketing for Fox, Mike Hopkins, had said earlier in the year that the network would consider moving its affiliation to another market station as a last resort if existing affiliates did not agree to the terms for reverse compensation retrans sharing.\n\nFox dropped its affiliation from Nexstar-owned/managed stations in four markets, with three of the replacement stations adding Fox in addition to existing affiliations with the MyNetworkTV program service (owned by Fox parent company News Corporation). In Indiana, two markets saw Fox go from a primary affiliation of one station to joining an existing MyNetworkTV-affiliated digital subchannel of a competing Big Three station, with MyNetworkTV going to a secondary affiliation: in Evansville, Fox moved from WTVW (which then became an independent station and later joined The CW) to a MyNetworkTV-affiliated subchannel of CBS affiliate WEVV-TV on July 1, while in Fort Wayne, the Fox affiliation moved from WFFT-TV to a MyNetworkTV-affiliated subchannel of NBC affiliate WISE-TV on August 1. The network also moved its affiliation in Springfield, Missouri from KSFX-TV (operated in a duopoly with area CBS affiliate KOLR) to upstart MyNetworkTV affiliate KRBK on September 1, 2011, with both stations becoming independents. Nexstar chose to drop Fox from WFXW in Terre Haute, Indiana and re-affiliate with ABC on September 1, 2011 (becoming the only Nexstar station thus far to affiliate with another network following the removal of the Fox affiliation) as part of a long-term renewal agreement between Nexstar and ABC for the group's nine existing ABC stations, reversing a 1995 switch that saw Terre Haute losing over-the-air carriage of ABC programs (since then, ABC has been seen in the market via Indianapolis affiliate WRTV on area cable and satellite providers); the Fox affiliation then moved to a digital subchannel of CBS affiliate WTHI-TV which also added MyNetworkTV as a secondary affiliation. Nexstar's remaining Fox affiliates have since signed a renewal agreement through December 2013; in addition, following the settlement of Nexstar's antitrust lawsuit against WISE-TV's then-owner Granite Broadcasting, WFFT-TV reclaimed the Fox affiliation on March 1, 2013.\n\nIn July 2012, Nexstar agreed to purchase 11 stations and Inergize Digital Media from Newport Television with two stations going to affiliate Mission Broadcasting.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would acquire the entire group of Communications Corporation of America, KMSS-TV, KPEJ-TV, and most of the ComCorp-managed stations that are owned by White Knight Broadcasting would be sold to Mission Broadcasting while WEVV-TV and White Knight Broadcasting's KSHV-TV would be sold to a female-controlled company called Rocky Creek Communications, with Nexstar assuming operational control of those stations.\n\nOn September 16, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would acquire WOI-DT, KCAU-TV, and WHBF-TV from Citadel Communications for $88 million. Nexstar immediately took over the stations' operations through a time brokerage agreement. The deal followed Phil Lombardo's decision to \"slow down,\" as well as a desire by Lynch Entertainment to divest its investments in WOI and WHBF; Citadel would continue to own KLKN, WLNE-TV, and its Sarasota properties. On March 5, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission approved the sale of these stations to Nexstar outright and the deal was completed on March 13. KCAU continued to use Citadel's standardized news sets, graphics and logos.\n\nOn November 6, 2013, Nexstar announced that it would purchase the Grant Broadcasting stations for $87.5 million. Due to Federal Communications Commission ownership regulations, one of the stations, KLJB, was spun off to Marshall Broadcasting Group, but is operated by Nexstar through a shared services agreement. The sale was completed on December 1, 2014.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, Nexstar announced that it presented an unsolicited offer to buy Media General for $4.1 billion (including debt). Per share, shareholders of Media General would receive $10.50 in cash and 0.0898 shares of Nexstar, a total equivalent of $14.50 per share. Nexstar's offer was seen by analysts as a maneuver to torpedo the merger of Media General with Meredith Corporation (announced on September 8). If Media General agreed to the counteroffer within a 20-day period, Nexstar would expand its portfolio to 114 television stations, pending spinoffs in markets where both own stations and federal approval. On November 16, Media General rejected the offer but agreed to negotiate after concluding its merge with Meredith.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Nexstar in a deal valued at $17.14 per share, valuing the company at $4.6 billion plus the assumption of $2.3 billion debt. The combined company became known as Nexstar Media Group, and owns 171 stations, serving an estimated 39% of U.S. households. The company paid Meredith Corporation (whom Media General had previously proposed a merger with) a termination fee of $60 million and gave Meredith right of first refusal to acquire any broadcast or digital properties that may be divested during the purchase. The deal also included contingent value rights for Media General shareholders if it sold spectrum from its stations during the FCC's spectrum incentive auction.\n\nOn May 27, 2016, Nexstar announced the sales of five stations. WCWJ in Jacksonville, Florida, along with WSLS-TV in Roanoke, Virginia, was sold to the Graham Media Group; and KADN-TV, as well as KLAF-LD in Lafayette, Louisiana, was sold to Bayou City Broadcasting, with KREG-TV in Glenwood Springs, Colorado going to Marquee Broadcasting as part of a series of divestitures required following Nexstar's acquisition of Media General due to Federal Communications Commission ownership caps (the sale of the Roanoke and Lafayette stations are required as Media General and Nexstar both own stations in those markets). On June 3, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar would spinoff WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin and KWQC-TV in Davenport, Iowa to Gray Television for $270 million.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Nexstar announced that it would sell WFFT in Fort Wayne, Indiana; KQTV in St. Joseph, Missouri; KIMT in Rochester, Minnesota; WTHI-TV in Terre Haute; and WLFI in Lafayette, Indiana to Heartland Media, through its USA Television MidAmerica Holdings joint venture with MSouth Equity Partners, for $115 million. The divestitures will allow Nexstar to comply with FCC ownership rules (specifically pertaining to national market coverage for station owners) in advance of the approval proceedings of the merger of both groups (Nexstar already owns NBC affiliate WTWO and operates ABC affiliate WAWV-TV in Terre Haute, and plans to acquire Media General-owned CBS affiliate WANE-TV in Fort Wayne).\n\nThe transaction was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017, and the sale was completed on January 17.\n\nOn March 13, 2014, Nexstar announced that it would purchase Internet Broadcasting, for $20 million. The company had also recently acquired competitor Inergize Digital through its purchase of assets from Newport Television, followed by Enterprise Technology Group, a spun-off joint venture between LIN Media and Fox Television Stations. The providers were merged to form Lakana, led by former ETG CEO Phillip Hyun.\n\nOn February 2, 2015, Nexstar finalized its acquisition of Yashi, a location focused video advertising and programmatic technology company, for $33 million. On November 17, 2015, Nexstar announced its intent to purchase West Virginia Media Holdings' stations (WOWK-TV in Charleston, WBOY-TV in Clarksburg, WVNS-TV in Ghent, and WTRF-TV in Wheeling) for $130 million. The company took over the stations' non-license assets under a time brokerage agreement in December 2015 pending the formal completion of the deal, expected in late 2016. The two companies viewed the acquisition as being a complement to Nexstar's WHAG-TV, whose coverage area includes the Eastern Panhandle region. Nexstar CEO Perry A. Sook is an alumnus of WOWK. The sale was completed on January 31, 2017.\n\nOn April 30, 2017, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that there were competing bids for Tribune Media from Nexstar and a partnership between 21st Century Fox and private equity firm Blackstone Group. However, on May 8, 2017, it was announced that Tribune reached a deal to be acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group. On May 26, 2017, it was reported by DealReporter that Nexstar may be considering a bid to acquire Tegna Inc., although such a deal would likely require significant divestments due to ownership conflicts and exceeding the ownership cap.\n\nOn November 14, 2018, after Tribune cancelled its proposed sale to Sinclair, it was reported that Nexstar was a leading bidder to acquire Tribune. On December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced its intent to acquire of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion ($4.1 billion for all of Tribune's shares in cash and $2.3 billion of Tribune's debt). The acquisition would give the company 216 stations in 118 markets, placing it just below the FCC's market cap of 39% of TV households and making it the largest owner of television stations in the United States. Nexstar plans to divest some stations and \"non-core\" assets as part of the merger.\n\nOn March 20, 2019, Nexstar announced that it would divest 19 stations to the E. W. Scripps Company and Tegna Inc. for a total sum of $1.32 billion, with Scripps receiving eight stations (WPIX, WSFL-TV, WTKR and WGNT, WTVR-TV, WXMI, KSTU, and KASW), and Tegna eleven (WATN-TV and WLMT, WTIC-TV and WCCT-TV, WOI-DT and KCWI, WNEP, WPMT, WQAD-TV, WZDX, and KFSM-TV). The sale agreement for WPIX, however, includes a condition allowing Nexstar to buy it back between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021. That station was valued at $75 million. Nexstar stated that these divestitures would be used to help fund the sale and cover debt.\n\nOn April 3, 2019, Marshall Broadcasting Group sued Nexstar for breach of contract, alleging that the company was trying to \"undermine\" its operations so it could buy back the stations at a later date and lower cost in the present regulatory environment. The company also accused Nexstar of using the divestiture of stations to a minority-owned broadcaster as a token to gain FCC approval for the associated acquisitions. A carriage dispute with AT&T resulted in the removal of more than 120 Nexstar stations across 97 markets from AT&T's DirecTV, DirecTV Now and U-verse platforms, which began at 11:59 p.m. on July 3, 2019 and ended on August 29, 2019.\n\nOn August 1, 2019, the United States Department of Justice approved the deal between Nexstar Media Group and Tribune Media. The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16, and would be consummated three days later.\n\nOn November 5, 2019, it was announced that Nexstar would acquire Fox Television Stations-owned WJZY and MyNetworkTV outlet WMYT-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina for $45 million. In turn, it also announced that it would sell its duopoly of Seattle-based KCPQ and KZJO (along with Milwaukee-based WITI) to FTS in a separate deal worth $350 million. Nexstar made the transactions to pay down debt and consolidate operations in the Southeast. The sale closed on March 2, 2020.\n\n"}

The band played at this point some Heavy-thrash-metal. Two years later Tems (19 years old) replaced Marot (guitar) and Kristof (18 years old) joins the band for the vocals. Kronos started then to play Death Metal music and recorded its first demo called \"Outrance\". \nIn 1999, Tom (20 years old) replaces Jéremy and the band is now definitely oriented towards 'Brutal Death Metal'. The following year the recording of a new demo \"Split Promo 2000\" containing 4 titles is finalized.\n\nThe long-awaited first album \"Titan's Awakening\" was released in 2001. This first edition of this album was produced by the band itself. The band has then been acclaimed by critics and got its first contract with the label Warpath Records (former \"Shockwave\").

Her career spans over 60 years, with her first major role being on a 1950s daytime drama, \"Love of Life\". She is best known for her role as Ellen Craig on the medical drama series \"St. Elsewhere\". She and her husband, actor William Daniels, who played her fictional husband Dr. Mark Craig, won the 1986 Emmy Awards on the same night, becoming the first married couple to accomplish the feat since Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in 1965.\n\nBartlett was born in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, the daughter of Carrie Archer and Elwin Earl Bartlett, and was raised in Moline, Illinois. Her father was an insurance salesman and a failed actor, and she was determined to live out his dream. In 1947, she graduated from Moline High School.\n\nBartlett studied acting with Lee Strasberg, and first got her start in television playing the heroine \"Vanessa Dale Raven\" on the soap opera \"Love of Life\" from 1955 to 1959, replacing actress Peggy McCay. She also had a previous role on the program, in which briefly she played the character of Ellie Crown, a role which was played for several years by Hildy Parks. She then moved on to nighttime roles in the 1960s.\n\nHer most widely known role was as Ellen Craig on \"St. Elsewhere\". Initially an infrequently recurring character, she took on greater prominence in the 1984–1985 season when the storyline included Ellen and Mark's marital problems. The storyline deepened in the next season when their son was killed and they had to raise their granddaughter. Bartlett won back-to-back Emmys, and was made a contract player. Further difficult material included Ellen and Mark's divorce and slow reconciliation following the loss of their granddaughter in a custody dispute with her birth mother.\n\nFor many years Bartlett accepted only small guest appearances on such programs as \"The Golden Girls\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"The Rockford Files\", and \"The Waltons\", as well as a recurring role as Grace Snider Edwards on \"Little House on the Prairie\" from 1974 to 1977. Her acting career picked up considerably in the 1980s, including the miniseries \"V\" and \"North and South: Book II\".\n\nBartlett and husband William Daniels made Emmy Awards history in 1986 when they became just the second real-life married couple to win acting awards on the same night. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne first accomplished the feat in 1965. Bartlett and Daniels won for their portrayals of Dr. Mark and Mrs. Ellen Craig on the TV series \"St. Elsewhere\". They later acted together again when she played a college dean who employed her husband's character, in a season of Daniels's ABC series \"Boy Meets World\", and their characters later married.\n\nWhen \"St. Elsewhere\" ended in 1988, Bartlett's career moved to a wide variety of guest-starring appearances, including major roles on \"Wiseguy\" as a tough and corrupt matriarch of a sewage business; as Andrea Drey, Secretary General of the United Earth Oceans Organization (UEO) on \"seaQuest DSV\"; on \"Home Improvement\" as Lucille Taylor (Tim \"The Tool Man\" Taylor's mother); and on \"ER\" as Ruth Katherine Greene. Bartlett's last feature film role to date was in the film \"Valediction\".\n\nBartlett and Daniels both served on the Screen Actors Guild's Board of Directors.\n\nBartlett was added to the Hall of Honor at her alma mater, Moline High School in Moline, Illinois.\n\nBartlett won two Emmy awards for her role as Ellen Craig on the television drama, \"St. Elsewhere\". She was the best supporting actress winner in both 1986 and 1987 and was nominated as well in 1988. For the same role, Bartlett also won a Q Award in 1987 as the Best Supporting Actress in a Quality Drama Series. \n\nBartlett met her husband, actor William Daniels at Northwestern University. They were married on June 30, 1951.\n\nIn 1961, she gave birth to a son, who died 24 hours later. They adopted two sons: Michael, who became an assistant director and stage manager in Los Angeles, and Robert, who became an artist and computer graphics designer based in New York City.\n\n"}
{"id": "1969270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969270", "title": "Faisal bin Musaid", "text": "Faisal bin Musaid\n\nFaisal bin Musaid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (, \"\"; 4 April 194418 June 1975) was the assassin, and nephew, of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.\n\nFaisal was born in 1944. His father was Prince Musa'id, the paternal half brother to six Saudi Arabian kings including King Faisal; his mother was Watfa, a daughter of Muhammad bin Talal, the 12th (and last) Rashidi Emir. His parents divorced. He and his brothers and sisters were much closer to their maternal Rashidi relatives than their paternal Al Saud relatives.\n\nIn 1966, his older brother Khaled, a Wahhabist, was killed during an assault on a new television station in Riyadh. Wahhabi clerics opposed the establishment of a national television service, as they believed it immoral to produce images of humans. The details of his death are disputed. Some reports allege that he actually died resisting arrest outside his own home. No investigation over his death was ever initiated. Faisal had another brother, Bandar, and a sister, Al Jawhara. Abdul Rahman bin Musaid is his half-brother.\n\nFaisal arrived in the United States in 1966 and attended San Francisco State College for two semesters studying English. Allis Bens, director of the American Language Institute at San Francisco State, said, \"He was friendly and polite and very well brought up, it seemed to me.\" While Faisal was at San Francisco State his brother Khaled was killed. After leaving San Francisco State College, Faisal went to the University of California at Berkeley and then to the University of Colorado at Boulder. He was described by his peers as \"[a] quiet, likable, notably unstudious young man\". University of Colorado Professor Edward Rozek, who had taught him in three comparative government courses, described him as \"academically a D and a C student\".\n\nIn 1969, while in Boulder he was arrested for conspiring to sell LSD. He pleaded guilty and was placed on probation for one year. In May 1970, the district attorney dropped the charges.\n\nIn 1971 he received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Colorado and then returned to the San Francisco Bay area. At the University of California at Berkeley he enrolled in graduate courses in political science, but did not receive a master's degree.\n\nAfter leaving the United States, he went to Beirut. For unknown reasons, he also went to East Germany. When he came back to Saudi Arabia, Saudi authorities seized his passport because of his troubles abroad. He began teaching at Riyadh University and kept in touch with his girlfriend, Christine Surma, who was 26 at the time of the assassination. Surma viewed the Saudi interest \"in achieving peace with Israel\" as positive outcomes \"not available with the previous ruler King Faisal\".\n\nOn 25 March 1975, he went to the Royal Palace in Riyadh, where King Faisal was holding a meeting, known as a majlis. He joined a Kuwaiti delegation and lined up to meet the king. The king recognized his nephew and bent his head forward, so that the younger Faisal could kiss the king's head in a sign of respect. The prince took out a revolver from his robe and shot the King twice in the head. His third shot missed and he threw the gun away. King Faisal fell to the floor. Bodyguards with swords and submachine guns arrested the prince. The king was quickly rushed to a hospital but doctors were unable to save him. Saudi television crews captured the entire assassination on camera.\n\nInitial reports described Faisal bin Musaid as \"mentally deranged\". He was moved to a Riyadh prison. However, he was later deemed sane to be tried.\n\nA sharia court found Faisal guilty of the king's murder on 18 June, and his public execution occurred hours later. His brother Bandar was imprisoned for one year and later released. Cars with loudspeakers drove around Riyadh publicly announcing the verdict and his imminent execution, and crowds gathered in the square. Faisal was led by a soldier to the execution point and was reported to have walked unsteadily. Wearing white robes and blindfolded, Faisal was beheaded with a single sweep of a gold-handled sword.\n\nAside from the death of his brother, other motives have been proposed. Beirut newspapers claimed involvement with drugs as a motivation in the assassination. Saudi officials began to state that the prince's actions were deliberate and planned. Rumours suggested that the prince had told his mother about his assassination plans, who in turn told King Faisal who responded that \"if it is Allah's will, then it would happen\". Arab media implied that the prince had been a tool of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Israeli's Mossad.\n\nBeirut newspapers offered three different explanations for the attack. \"An-Nahar\" reported that the attack may have been possible vengeance for the dethroning of King Saud, because Faisal was scheduled to marry Saud's daughter—Princess Sita—in the same week. \"An-Nahar\" also reported that King Faisal had ignored his repeated complaints that his $3,500 monthly allowance ($15,200/month in 2014 dollars, $182,400/year) was insufficient and this may have prompted the assassination. \"Al Bayrak\" reported that according to reliable Saudi sources, King Faisal prohibited him from leaving the country because of his excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs and the attack may have been a retaliation against the ban.\n\n"}

The squadron is based out of Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, AZ and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). In December 2016, VMFA-122 officially became known as the \"Flying Lethernecks.” Yet another name change was ordered at this time as their fate to transition to F-35B neared, and paired with it higher visibility and the concern to not offend anyone using the otherwise rich-in-history name “Crusader.” Their traditional raído call sign is \"Nickel\". On November 14, 2017, VMFA-122 opened a new chapter of their history, transitioning from the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C Hornet to the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II and moving from MCAS Beaufort and MAG-31, 2nd MAW to MCAS Yuma and MAG-13, 3rd MAW.\n\nConduct anti-air warfare and offensive air support operations in support of Fleet Marine Forces from advance bases, expeditionary airfields, and aircraft carriers, and to conduct such other air operations as may be directed.\n\nMarine Fighter Squadron 122 (VMF-122) was commissioned on March 1, 1942 at Camp Kearny in San Diego, California. Outfitted with the F4F Wildcat, the squadron, then known as the \"Candystripers\", saw their first combat tour in October 1942. During this tour they were part of the Cactus Air Force at Henderson Field and also operated out of Espiritu Santo. In April 1943, while under the command of Major Pappy Boyington, the squadron transitioned to the F4U Corsair and accounted for 35½ kills. The squadron's first combat tour ended on July 23, 1943 after which they returned to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on August 16. For the next year after their return to the States, the squadron was reorganized and retrained at Marine Corps Air Station El Centro, California.\n\nFor its second tour, VMF-122's flight echelon embarked upon the escort carrier in July 1944 while the ground echelon steamed out on the . Beginning in October 1944 the echelons were reunited and began operating from an airstrip on Peleliu. At times they provided close air support for Marines during the Battle of Peleliu at distances of just over 1000 yards from where they took off. The squadrons ability to provide napalm and rockets, both new weapons systems, greatly aided in the destruction of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. For the remainder of the war they remained on the island conducting combat operations until August 1945.\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, VMF-122 returned home to Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station Oak Grove, North Carolina in January 1946. They remained there for less than two years before being moved to MCAS Beaufort which was followed by another move to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina.\n\nThe squadron was reactivated in November 1947, flying the FH Phantom, becoming the first Marine squadron to employ jet-propelled aircraft. During this time, the squadron also fielded the first and only Marine aerial demonstration team known as the \"Flying Leathernecks\". They toured the country for two years before being disbanded with the transition to the F2H Banshee. In April 1951, the squadron became the first Marine jet squadron to be both day and night qualified for carrier operations. On 15 May 1951, the squadron deployed from Naval Air Station Quonset Point aboard the to the Mediterranean Sea, returning to the Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point in early October 1951. In 1952, they again transitioned to the F9F Panther and after a Mediterranean cruise in 1953, they were assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 24 at MCAS Cherry Point.\n\nJanuary 1954 again saw the squadron transitioning aircraft, this time to the FJ Fury. The next few years saw a litany of small deployments on board a multitude of aircraft carriers. The squadron relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in September 1957 and in December of that year they became the first squadron in the Marine Corps to fly the F-8 Crusader. It was at this time that they transitioned from being the \"Candystripers\" to the new nickname of \"Crusaders.\" The squadron became VMF(AW)-122 upon receiving all weather capable F-8Es in 1962. That year they also deployed to Key West, Florida to fly combat air patrol during the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nIn 1964, VMF(AW)-122 deployed to Naval Air Facility Atsugi for a year and returned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in January 1965. While at MCAS El Toro they transitioned to the F-4B Phantom and were redesignated VMFA-122. They deployed to the Republic of Vietnam in August 1967 and operated from Da Nang Air Base. For the next five months, the squadron flew 2540 sorties and delivered 4800 tons of ordnance. In February 1968, while supporting Marines during the Siege of Khe Sanh the squadron flew 629 sorties and dropped 1300 tons of ordnance. They rotated to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in September 1968 and returned to Vietnam during the summer of 1969, this time operating from Chu Lai Air Base.\n\nFollowing their time in Vietnam, the Crusaders were assigned to MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii in September 1970. They were then ordered to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan as a Joint Chiefs of Staff directive to counter a North Vietnamese offensive against South Vietnam. The squadron returned to Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii on 27 December 1972.\nOn August 14, 1974, VMFA-122 was placed in a cadre status in anticipation of becoming the Marine Corps’ first F-14A squadron. With the decision not to accept the Tomcat into the Marine Corps inventory, VMFA-122 was reactivated at MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina and refitted with the F-4J in September 1975. On September 25, 1985, VMFA-122 flew its last F-4 sortie, completing 20 years of service as a F-4 “Phantom” squadron.\n\nOn January 22, 1986, the squadron began a new era with the acceptance of its first F/A-18A Hornet. Throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s (decade), VMFA-122 conducted multiple training deployments to Europe and throughout the United States.\n\nIn October 2001, the Crusaders increased their combat capabilities by transitioning to the F/A-18C. The squadron participated in the Unit Deployment Program (UDP), completing eleven deployments to the Western\nPacific. From July 2002 to July 2003, the Crusaders completed a year-long UDP due to the \"stop-move\" order implemented by the Marine Corps. This allowed Hornet squadrons from Beaufort to deploy to Kuwait in anticipation of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in January 2003. The Crusaders were dispatched from MCAS Iwakuni to many locations in the Pacific Rim, including Marine Corps Air Facility Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii and Clark AB in the Philippines. In January 2005, the “Crusaders” continued the UDP rotation, deploying to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. In September 2006 the \"Crusaders\" again returned to MCAS Iwakuni with detachments to Clark AB in the Philippines, Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa, and Khorat, Thailand.\n\nPrior to another squadron deployment in support of OIF later in 2008, the squadron's commander reverted the unit to their older World War II nickname, the \"Werewolves\". The squadron began its first combat deployment in more than 30 years when it left MCAS Beaufort on August 29, 2010 for Kandahar Airfield, KAF. The Werewolves returned from their seven-month deployment on March 21, 2009. In April, 2012, the new commander of VMFA-122, LtCol Wiegel, decided the squadron would revert to the \"Crusaders\" nickname. However, after the nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation threatened to sue the military under the Establishment Clause to forbid the Crusaders name and logo, the Marine Deputy Commandant for aviation directed VMFA-122 to revert the unit identification back to \"Werewolves.\"\n\nA unit citation or commendation is an award bestowed upon an organization for the action cited. Members of the unit who participated in said actions are allowed to wear on their uniforms the awarded unit citation. VMFA-122 has been presented with the following awards:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work, in C minor, features a sad and sombre opening and climaxes with an intense, tempestuous central section, before the return of the elegiac opening theme.\n\nIn 1880, having completed his First Piano Quartet, Fauré began work on a cello sonata. It was his frequent practice to compose the slow movement of a work first, and he did so for the new sonata. The completed movement was probably premiered at the salon of Camille Saint-Saëns in June 1880. The movement, like the quartet, is in the key of C minor. Whether the rest of the sonata would have been in that key is unknown: Fauré never completed it, and in January 1883 the slow movement was published as a stand-alone piece under the title \"Élégie\".\nThe first performance of the work under its new title was given at the Société Nationale de Musique in December 1883 by the composer and the cellist Jules Loeb to whom the piece is dedicated. The \"Élégie\" was a great success from the outset, and the conductor Édouard Colonne asked Fauré for a version for cello and orchestra. Fauré agreed, and that version was premiered at the Société Nationale in April 1901, with Pablo Casals as soloist and the composer as conductor.\n\nThe piece is in the AABA CC trans D AC'C'coda form, in which the musical material of the beginning returns to close the piece after a contrasting middle section. The opening is a sombre, long-breathed melody. The cello carries the main thematic material, with piano providing a harmonically varied accompaniment. In the major-key middle section the piano bears the melodic theme before it passes to the cello. The middle section ends with a forceful passage in which the piano and cello exchange vehement themes. The dynamics remain loud as the first section returns, but the quiet sombreness of the opening soon takes over. The repeated opening theme is matched with some of the rhythmic features carried over from the middle section. The work ends in an atmosphere of calm.\n\nThe orchestral version of the work requires two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns and strings to accompany the cellist.\n\nThe Fauré specialist Jean-Michel Nectoux writes that the \"Élégie\" was one of the last works in which the composer allowed himself \"such a direct expression of pathos\". Nectoux regards the piece as \"one of the last manifestations of French musical Romanticism. From now on Fauré's music was to be more introverted and discreet.\"\n\n"}

It stars Bill Cosby (Mother), Raquel Welch (Jugs), Harvey Keitel (Speed), and Larry Hagman as employees of an independent ambulance service trying to survive in Los Angeles.\n\nThe F+B Ambulance Company is locked in an intense battle with the Unity Ambulance Company to win a city contract for providing ambulance service to a territory within Los Angeles. Their star driver is \"Mother\" Tucker (Bill Cosby), a talented antihero who drinks alcohol on duty, harasses nuns, and behaves brazenly towards practically everybody he meets, including his partner Leroy (Bruce Davison). Indeed, the entire company is a band of misfits, including the hypersexual John Murdoch (Larry Hagman), his partner Walker (Michael McManus), putative medical student Bliss (Allan Warnick), and brash Texan \"Rodeo\" Moxey (Dick Butkus). Handling calls at the switchboard is Jennifer (Raquel Welch), whom the drivers nickname \"Jugs\" for her ample bosom. Harry \"Doughnut\" Fishbine (Allen Garfield) runs the company, using occasionally underhanded means (such as kickbacks) to maintain an income stream.\n\nWhen Walker is injured after falling through a staircase on a call, Harry Fishbine hires Tony Malatesta (Harvey Keitel), a disgraced sheriff's detective and former Vietnam War ambulance driver. Upon learning that Tony has been suspended from the sheriff force due to allegations that he sold cocaine to children, Mother nicknames him \"Speed\". Speed is initially paired with Murdoch, though their partnership is strained when Speed must stop Murdoch from raping an unconscious female college student who has overdosed on Seconal. On a false emergency call, Leroy is shot and killed by a junkie (Toni Basil) demanding drugs. When Mother pulls a gun on the junkie, the junkie commits suicide. Later that night, a drunken Mother assaults Murdoch for stating that Leroy's death \"doesn't count\"; though Murdoch states this in regard to the drivers' \"dead body\" pool, Mother perceives it as an attack on the character of his dead partner. Harry then partners Speed with Mother to alleviate his driver shortage.\n\nMeanwhile, Jugs has obtained her Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and ambulance driver certifications, and forces her way onto F+B's active roster with threats of sexual discrimination lawsuits. When Speed fakes an injury to prevent Jugs' arrest for misuse of an ambulance, the two fall in love. Though Jugs proves a capable EMT, she loses her nerve after a pregnant woman under her care suffers a severe obstetrical hemorrhage and bleeds to death in Mother's ambulance. Jugs secludes herself afterward until Mother counsels her and gives her the courage to return to work.\n\nAt a City Hall meeting, City Councilman Warren informs the owners of both Unity and F+B that they will not be awarded the contract—it will instead be awarded to a larger, established company. To save their businesses, Unity's owner, Charles Taylor, proposes that their two companies merge. Though the councilman is agreeable to the merger, Fishbine is not. The discussion is interrupted by an emergency call: Murdoch, intoxicated and armed with a handgun, has broken into F+B's bus garage office with Walker and is holding Mrs. Fishbine hostage. All of Unity's and F+B's ambulances descend on the F+B garage; upon arrival, Murdoch opens fire and hits Speed in the shoulder. When Mother charges onto the garage grounds to rescue his ambulance, he comes face to face with Murdoch; Murdoch tries to shoot Mother, but his gun is empty. A deputy sheriff then shoots and kills Murdoch.\n\nIn the aftermath of this incident, F+B does merge with Unity, forming the Fishbine + Unity (F+U) Ambulance Company, based out of the old F+B garage. (The new acronym for the company is also a slang abbreviation of \"fuck you\"; the old F+B stood for \"Fish + Bine\".) Speed, who has been cleared of all charges, is reinstated to the police force, though he remains romantically involved with Jugs. Jugs is initially relegated to switchboard duty again, until Mother insists that she become his new partner. The two drive off together, with Mother harassing the nuns one more time as the movie ends.\n\n\nThere was originally a role written for professional wrestler Lillian Ellison (The Fabulous Moolah) in the film, but she had to drop out of the role due to a gallbladder infection.\n\n20th Century Fox attempted to turn the film into a television series, although none of the original cast participated. The program was titled \"Mother, Juggs & Speed\" with a double \"g\" because the network would not allow the lead female character to have a name that made explicit reference to her breasts. Instead, producers added the concept that Jennifer's nickname was taken from her real last name, Juggston. The series was not picked up, but ABC aired the pilot as a one-time special in August 1978.\n\nJoseph Barbera, one half of the legendary cartoon-creating duo Hanna-Barbera, served as executive producer for this movie. Tom Mankiewicz says it was Barbera's idea to make a film about ambulance driving. He had a deal with 20th Century Fox who paid a writer to develop a script. Mankiewicz, then best known for writing several James Bond movies, became interested and was hired. He did research on the subject and wrote his own script, and then attached Peter Yates as director. Alan Ladd Jr., then head of production for Fox, said he would make the film if it could be done for less than $3 million.\n\nYates and Mankiewicz thought the lead role of Mother Tucker was perfect for Gene Hackman and offered him the role but Hackman was exhausted from working on \"Lucky Lady\" and declined. However he recommended Bill Cosby as an alternative; Yates, Mankiewicz and Ladd all agreed and Cosby accepted the part. The tight budget meant the leads had to accept deferred payment. The female lead was offered to Valerie Perrine but she would not take deferred payment so Raquel Welch was cast instead.\n\nAccording to Tom Mankiewicz the film was made for around $3 million and grossed $17 million.\n\n\"Mother, Jugs & Speed\" was referenced in the 2006 film \"Relative Strangers\" multiple times, most notably during the game of Charades scene.\n\n\"Mother, Jugs & Speed\" was rated in M in New Zealand and Australia, where it was previously rated PG.\n\n"}

{"id": "1969342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969342", "title": "The Garden of God", "text": "The Garden of God\n\nThe Garden of God is a romance novel by Henry De Vere Stacpoole, first published in 1923. It is the first sequel to his best-selling novel \"The Blue Lagoon\" (1908), and continued with \"The Gates of Morning\" (1925). \"The Garden of God\" was adapted into the film \"Return to the Blue Lagoon\".\n\nThe sequel picks up precisely where the first book left off, with Arthur Lestrange in the ship \"Raratonga\" discovering his son Dicky and niece Emmeline with their own child, lying in their fishing boat which has drifted out to sea. While the last line of \"The Blue Lagoon\" states that they are not dead but sleeping, the first line of the sequel is \"No, they are dead\", and the reader is told that they have stopped breathing. The child is drowsy but alive and is picked up by the sailors.\n\nArthur is shaken, but at the same time relieved. He can see that Dicky and Emmeline were healthy and that they must have lived in peace. He feels it is better that they died while still in a savage state and did not have to return to civilization. He has a dream-vision of the pair; they ask him to come to Palm Tree, the island where they lived, and promise he will see them again.\n\nTheir child becomes quite popular with the \"Raratonga\"s crew. His favorite among the sailors is a rascally quasi-pirate called Jim Kearney. Because the child says \"Dick\" and \"Em\" while playing with the sailors, Kearney calls him Dick M.\n\nCaptain Stanistreet has been concerned for Arthur's sanity since they found Dicky and Emmeline, but he appears calm when they get to Palm Tree, investigating the things the couple left behind. Only when he enters the house and finds the flower decorations and neatly arranged supplies—unmistakably the work of Emmeline—does he break down in tears.\n\nArthur plans to stay on the island with Dick M and the captain of the \"Raratonga\" asks for volunteers from among his crew to stay also. Jim Kearney volunteers. The captain says they will return the following year, but the ship is promptly swallowed up in a storm out at sea. Arthur believes his dream-vision is partly fulfilled when he looks at Dick and notices characteristics of both Emmeline and Dicky in him. Kearney does most of the parenting for Dick.\n\nYears pass; Arthur dies quietly while walking in the forest and his body is never found. Kearney and Dick are left to their own devices until an intruder enters: a young woman named Katafa (her name means \"Frigatebird\"). She hails from the island of Karolin, forty miles away, which is populated by Kanaka natives. It is a huge, almost treeless coral atoll, with no water source other than rain. Dicky and Emmeline were aware of the Kanaka's existence, but never encountered them—for many reasons, they stay away from Palm Tree and believe it is haunted. Katafa is actually the daughter of a Spanish sea captain who was killed to prevent his taking water from their wells during a drought. Raised by priestess Le Juan, and psychologically conditioned as a \"taminan\" untouchable, she can talk and interact with Karolin natives, but cannot touch or be touched by them. She is on Palm Tree only because a storm blew her fishing boat off course. She makes friends with Dick and teaches him her language, naming him \"Taori\", but Kearney is suspicious of her, particularly when he finds she evades touch. She is likewise antagonistic toward him for having tried to touch her.\n\nHer boat destroyed by a volley from a passing ship, she has to stay on Palm Tree until further notice. She lights a fire as a prayer to Nanawa, the ocean god, to return her to Karolin, but Kearney thinks she is trying to signal her people to attack the island. She gets back at Kearney by stealing his chewing gum, blunting his fish spears and sabotaging his fishing lines. He comes to believe she is out to kill him and is about to return the favor when, pursuing her into the lagoon, he is trapped and killed by a giant tentacled cephalopod.\n\nLeft to themselves, Dick and Katafa live somewhat as Dicky and Emmeline had done; Dick taking Katafa for granted unless he wants help or an audience. Katafa still wants to go home; she creates an image of Nan, the gentler of Karolin's two gods, out of a coconut shell, and puts it up on the reef on a pole, as a signal should any Karolin fishermen come close to the island. The god belongs only to Karolin's people and will show either that someone from Karolin lives on Palm Tree, or that Nan has been \"kidnapped\".\n\nSure enough, four Karolin fishermen arrive. Seeing their proprietary god on a reef with Dick (a foreigner) nearby, they attack him. He lashes out, killing one. Katafa is angry when she learns her people were that close, but she finds she cannot hate Dick; she's falling in love with him, to the point that she begins to desire to touch other living things. Dick wants to hug her, but she automatically evades him and hides in the forest, due to her psychological conditioning.\n\nThe narrative focus shifts to Karolin. The three remaining fishermen return with their terrible news. The fisherman Dick killed was the grandson of the island's king, Uta Matu, and the fishermen assume that where they saw one 'foreigner', there must be dozens, maybe hundreds. Worst of all, Nan is there, seemingly stolen by the newcomers. Advised by Le Juan in one of her epileptic trances, the king declares war and all the men of Karolin assemble in their canoes, led by the king's son Laminai and his second son, Ma.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Dick pursues Katafa through the forest once more, carrying a spear in case of trouble, when he runs straight into the warriors. He kills Ma with the spear and is about to be killed by Laminai, when Katafa leaps out of nowhere and attacks Laminai. The people have long believed Katafa to be dead, so the warriors flee, thinking she is a ghost. A sudden storm blows up, and in the darkness, noise and confusion the Kanaka kill each other.\n\nNow able to hold and touch one another, Dick and Katafa become lovers. They stay together on Palm Tree, but prepare to leave for Karolin. When a schooner of copra harvesters arrives, crewed by Melanesian slaves under the direction of two white men, Dick wants to speak to them, but is attacked. He kills the leader, and the Melanesians stage an uprising and take over the island. Dick and Katafa escape to Karolin. By chance, Dick has picked up a large, beautifully decorated club left by the warriors. Katafa tells Dick that it is the sacred war club, and can be carried only by men of the royal family, so he must be the new king of Karolin, and indeed, when they get there, Uta Matu has died. The people—women, very young men, and little children—have turned against old priestess Le Juan, who has terrorized them for so many years and whose advice had sent all the warriors to die on Palm Tree. She drops dead of a stroke when she sees Katafa, seemingly returned from the dead, and the people proclaim Dick their new king.\n"}

Its key signature consists of two sharps. Its relative minor is B minor and its parallel minor is D minor.\n\nThe D major scale is:\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\nD major is well-suited to violin music because of the structure of the instrument, which is tuned G D A E. The open strings resonate sympathetically with the D string, producing a sound that is especially brilliant. This is also the case with all other orchestral strings.\n\nIt is thus no coincidence that many classical composers throughout the centuries have chosen to write violin concertos in D major, including those by Mozart (No. 2, 1775, No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven (1806); Paganini (No. 1, 1817); Brahms (1878); Tchaikovsky (1878); Prokofiev (No. 1, 1917); Stravinsky (1931); and Korngold (1945).\n\nThe key is also appropriate for guitar music, with drop D tuning making two D's available as open strings. For some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very suitable key, since it transposes to E major on B wind instruments, and beginning methods generally tend to avoid keys with more than three sharps.\n\nEven so, the clarinet in B is still often used for music in D major, and it is perhaps the sharpest key that is practical for the instrument. There are composers however who, in writing a piece in D minor with B clarinets, will have them change to clarinets in A if the music switches to D major, two examples being Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the fourth movement.\n\nThe vast majority of tin whistles are in D, since they are often used in music with fiddles. It is a common key for Pub session playing.\n\nIn the Baroque period, D major was regarded as \"the key of glory\"; hence many trumpet concertos were in D major, such as those by Johann Friedrich Fasch, Gross, Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli. Many trumpet sonatas were in D major, too, such as those by Corelli, Petronio Franceschini, Purcell, and Torelli. \"The Trumpet Shall Sound\" and the \"Hallelujah\" chorus from Handel's \"Messiah\", and his coronation anthem \"Zadok the Priest\" are in D major.\n\n23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most-often used main key of his symphonies. The vast majority of Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony evolved from the overture, and \"D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century.\" This continued even into the Romantic Period, and was used for the \"triumphant\" final movements of several D minor symphonies, including Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Robert Schumann's Fourth Symphony, the only symphony by César Franck, Sergei Rachmaninoff's First Symphony, and Felix Mendelssohn's Fifth Symphony.\n\nFamous symphonies written in D major include Mozart's symphonies No. 31 (Paris) and No. 38 (Prague), Beethoven's No. 2 Op. 36, Brahms's No. 2 Op. 73, Sibelius's No. 2 Op. 43, Mahler's No. 9 (though it ends in the remote key of D-flat major) and Prokofiev's No. 1 (Classical) Op. 25.\n\n\n"}

At 17:10 the TV picture wobbled slightly, followed by a deep buzz. The audio was replaced by a distorted voice delivering a message for almost six minutes.\n\nThe individual identified himself as Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command.\nReports of the incident vary, some calling the speaker \"Vrillon\" or \"Gillon\", and others \"Asteron\".\n\nThe interruption ceased shortly after the statement had been delivered, transmissions returning to normal shortly before the end of a \"Looney Tunes\" cartoon. Later in the evening, Southern Television apologised for what it described as \"a breakthrough in sound\" for some viewers. ITN also reported on the incident in its own late-evening Saturday bulletin.\n\nSpeaking on British commercial radio on 6 December 1977, Sir John Whitmore also questioned newspaper reporting of the incident, referring to a recording of the complete broadcast which appeared to exist at the time.\n\nA complete transcript of the message reads:\n\nThis is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New Age of Aquarius. The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides at present operating on your world. They will suck your energy from you – the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return. Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn to be sensitive to the voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies. You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all we can to help you. Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth. We here at the Ashtar Galactic Command thank you for your attention. We are now leaving the planes of your existence. May you be blessed by the supreme love and truth of the cosmos.\n\nThe Winter 1977 issue of \"Fortean Times\" (issue #24) magazine featured a transcript of what they described as the 'short message' that was broadcast:\n\nThis is the voice of Asteron. I am an authorised representative of the Intergalactic Mission, and I have a message for the planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius and there are many corrections which have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace... or leave the galaxy.\n\nAt that time, the Hannington UHF television transmitter was unusual in being one of the few main transmitters which rebroadcast an off-air signal received from another transmitter (the Independent Broadcasting Authority's Rowridge transmitter on the Isle of Wight), rather than being fed directly by a landline. As a consequence it was open to this kind of signal intrusion, as even a relatively low-powered transmission very close to the rebroadcast receiver could overwhelm its reception of the intended signal, resulting in the unauthorised transmission being amplified and rebroadcast across a far wider area. The IBA stated to carry out a hoax would take \"a considerable amount of technical know-how\" and a spokesman for Southern Television confirmed \"A hoaxer jammed our transmitter in the wilds of North Hampshire by taking another transmitter very close to it.\" The hoaxer has not been identified.\n\nThe incident caused some local alarm and attracted publicity. In the next day's Sunday newspapers, the IBA announced the broadcast was a hoax. The IBA confirmed it was the first time such a hoax transmission had been made.\n\nHundreds of worried viewers flooded Southern Television with calls on Saturday night after the voice interrupted the routine news programme for more than six minutes.\n\nReports of the event carried worldwide with numerous American newspapers picking up the story from the UPI press agency.\n\nThe broadcast became a footnote in ufology as some chose to accept the supposed \"alien\" broadcast at face value, questioning the explanation of a transmitter hijack. Within two days of the incident's report in \"The Times\", a letter to the editor published on 30 November 1977 asked, \"[How] can the IBA – or anyone else – be sure that the broadcast was a hoax?\" The editorial board of one American local newspaper—the \"Eugene Register-Guard\"—commented, \"Nobody seemed to consider that 'Asteron' may have been for real.\" By as late as 1985, the story had entered urban folklore, with suggestions there had never been any explanation of the broadcast.\n\nA 1999 episode of children's television series \"It's a Mystery\" featured the event, produced by one of Southern's successors, Meridian Television. The feature reenacted the incident with faux news reports and viewers watching the incident play out at home.\n\nAuthor Nelson Algren included a variation of the message in his book \"The Devil's Stocking\" (1983), a fictionalised account of the trial of Rubin Carter, a real-life prize-fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. In the book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character 'Kenyatta' gives a speech closely mirroring the \"Fortean Times\" transcript of the Southern Television interruption:\n\n\"I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission,\" Kenyatta finally disclosed his credentials. \"I have a message for the Planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius. Many corrections have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace\" – here he paused to gain everybody's attention – \"you must live in peace or leave the galaxy!\"\n\nOn his 2020 album, \"Common Sense Dancing\", musician Duncan Parsons included a track \"A Breakthrough In Sound\" which describes the Broadcast Interruption from the fictionalised point of view of a person witnessing the event, watching television as it was happening. The underlying soundscape makes heavy use of Mellotron sounds.\n"}

The compound is used as a desiccant (to keep things dry by absorbing water from the air) and as a filter of fluoride, arsenic and selenium in drinking water. It is made of aluminium oxide (alumina; AlO). It has a very high surface-area-to-weight ratio, due to the many \"tunnel like\" pores that it has. Activated alumina in its phase composition can be represented only by metastable forms (gamma-AlO etc.). Corundum (alpha-AlO), the only stable form of aluminum oxide, does not have such a chemically active surface and is not used as a sorbent.\n\nActivated alumina is used for a wide range of adsorbent and catalyst applications including the adsorption of catalysts in polyethylene production, in hydrogen peroxide production, as a selective adsorbent for many chemicals including arsenic, fluoride, in sulfur removal from fluid streams (Claus Catalyst process).\n\nUsed as a desiccant, it works by a process called \"adsorption\". The water in the air actually sticks to the alumina itself in between the tiny passages as the air passes through them. The water molecules become trapped so that the air is dried out as it passes through the filter. This process is reversible. If the alumina desiccant is heated to ~200 °C, it will release the trapped water. This process is called \"regenerating\" the desiccant.\n\nActivated alumina is also widely used to remove fluoride from drinking water. In the US, there are widespread programs to fluoridate drinking water. However, in certain regions, such as the Rajasthan region of India, there is enough fluoride in the water to cause fluorosis. A study from the Harvard school of Public Health found exposure to fluoride as a child correlated with lower IQ.\n\nActivated alumina filters can easily reduce fluoride levels from 10 ppm to less than 1 ppm. The amount of fluoride leached from the water being filtered depends on how long the water is actually touching the alumina filter media. Basically, the more alumina in the filter, the less fluoride will be in the final, filtered water. Lower temperature water, and lower pH water (acidic water) are filtered more effectively too. Ideal pH for treatment is 5.5, which allows for up to a 95% removal rate.\n\nAs per researches conducted by V.K.Chhabra, Chief Chemist (retd.) P.H.E.D. Rajasthan, activated alumina, when used as a fluoride filter, under field conditions can best be regenerated by a solution of lye (sodium hydroxide; NaOH), sulfuric acid (HSO).\n\nThe fluoride uptake capacity (FUC) of activated alumina can be up to 5000 mg/kg. The FUC using V.K. Chhabra's method can be determined as follows:\n\nFluoride solution: Dissolve 22.1 g anhydrous NaF in distilled water and dilute to 1,000 mL.\n1 mL = 10 mg fluoride.\n10 mL/L = 100 mg/L fluoride.\n\nProcedure:\n\nTo one litre of simulated distilled water containing 100 mg/L of fluoride, agitate at 100 rpm using the jar test machine. Add 10 g of the AA under test. After one hour, switch off the machine and take out the solution. After 5 minutes, carefully decant the supernatant solution and determine the fluoride. Calculate the difference between the original and treated water fluoride concentration. Multiply the difference by 100 to give the fluoride uptake capacity of AA in mg/kg.\n\nIn high vacuum applications, activated alumina is used as a charge material in \"fore-line traps\" to prevent oil generated by rotary vane pumps from back streaming into the system.\n\nIts mechanical properties and non-reactivity in the biological environment allow it to be a suitable material used to cover surfaces in friction in body prostheses (e.g. hip or shoulder prostheses).\n\nDefluoridation\n\nDefluoridation is the downward adjustment of the level of fluoride in drinking water. Activated Alumina process is one of the widely used adsorption methods for the defluoridation of drinking water.\n\n"}

It was written between 1881 and 1883 and was revised in 1885. It is dedicated to Ludwig II of Bavaria. The premiere, given under Arthur Nikisch and the Gewandhaus Orchestra in the opera house at Leipzig on 30 December 1884, brought Bruckner the greatest success he had known in his life. The symphony is sometimes referred to as the \"Lyric\", though the appellation is not the composer's own, and is seldom used.\n\nIn the article \"The 20 Greatest Symphonies of all time\" from BBC Music Magazine, this symphony is placed at the 20 position. Bruckner also holds the 13 place with Symphony No. 8.\n\nThe symphony has four movements:\n\nThe first movement starts with tremolo strings and the cellos presenting \"a complete, divinely given melodic whole:\"\n\\new Staff \\relative e { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key e \\major \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\n\"Bruckner declared he heard it in a dream, played on a viola, and wrote it down on awakening, but the tune incorporates a quotation from the \"Credo\" of his D minor Mass (1864) which he was currently revising. The main theme is restated before the second theme group appears, with the oboes and clarinets carrying the first theme:\n\\new Staff \\relative b { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key b \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe third theme group is based on octaves, as is typical in Bruckner:\n\\new Staff \\relative b' { \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Ruhig\" 2 = 48 \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key b \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n\\new Staff \\relative b, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key b \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe development features many of the themes in inversion. Near the end of the movement, there is a long pedal point on E, sustained by the double basses and timpani.\n\nThis movement was composed between January and April 1883. Bruckner began writing it in anticipation of the death of Richard Wagner, who was in poor health. The movement features four Wagner tubas, which was their first appearance in a symphony:\n</score>\nA contrabass tuba is also present. The second part of the movement, beginning in F major, has a tune that Bruckner specialist Georg Tintner described as such: \"If I could describe what makes Bruckner Bruckner to me, it is that tune. It is something which transcends ordinary sorts of feelings. You can't even say 'Is it jolly?' 'Is it sad?' 'Is it that?' 'Is it that?'. You can't say that with a late Beethoven tune either. It is above these things:\"\n\\new Staff \\relative cis' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key fis \\major \\clef treble \\time 3/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Moderato\" 4 = 54\n\\new Staff \\relative fis, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key fis \\major \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n</score>\nLegend has it that Bruckner wrote the cymbal clash at the climax of this movement upon hearing the news that Wagner had died. By way of contrast, Williman Mann states that \"at the climax of the slow movement Nikisch persuaded Bruckner to add a cymbal clash supported by a triangle; later this addition to the manuscript was marked 'invalid' – but not in the composer's hand, so who was the purist?\"\n\nThe scherzo is in A minor and opens with a rhythmic string figure and a melody with a leap of an octave played by a solo trumpet:\n\\new Staff \\relative e' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef treble \\time 3/4 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Sehr schnell\" 4 = 240\n\\new Staff \\relative a, { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n</score>\nThe Trio is in F major and is in a slower tempo:\n\\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key f \\major \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n</score>\n\nUnlike the Fifth and Eighth symphonies, where the Finale sums up the entire symphony, this Finale is not as expansive as the other movements. Georg Tintner compared this Finale to the finale of a Haydn symphony. Like the first movement, the fourth movement opens with tremolo strings:\n\\new Staff \\relative e\" { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key e \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell\" 2 = 60\n\\new Staff \\relative e' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key e \\major \\clef treble \\time 2/2\n</score>\nThe second theme group is in the distant key of A major:\n</score>\nThe third theme group is a characteristic \"octave theme\" given by the whole orchestra in A minor:\n\\new Staff \\relative a { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"piano\" \\key a \\minor \\clef treble \\time 2/2 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 2 = 50\n\\new Staff \\relative a, { \\key a \\minor \\clef bass \\time 2/2\n</score>\nIn the recapitulation, the subject groups are reversed in order – a form called \"tragic sonata form\" or \"arch form\".\n\nThis was the version performed at the work's premiere. It survives only in one autograph copy which includes later changes by Bruckner and others, so the exact contents of this version are lost and it is unpublished.\n\nSome changes were made after the 1884 premiere but before the first publication by Gutmann in 1885. It is widely accepted that Nikisch, Franz Schalk and Ferdinand Löwe had significant influence over this edition, but there is some debate over the extent to which these changes were authorized by Bruckner. These changes mostly affect tempo and orchestration.\n\nRobert Haas attempted to remove the influence of Nikisch, Schalk and Löwe in order to retrieve Bruckner's original conception of the symphony. Haas used some material from the 1883 autograph but because this autograph also includes later changes much of his work was the product of conjecture. The most prominent feature of Haas's edition is the absence of cymbals, triangle and timpani in the slow movement: Haas asserted that Bruckner decided to omit the percussion, a claim scholar Benjamin Korstvedt deems \"implausible\".\n\nLeopold Nowak kept most of the changes in the 1885 Gutmann edition, including the percussion. He reprinted the tempo modifications from Gutmann but placed them in brackets. Some performances of this edition omit the cymbal crash at the climax of the slow movement, but it is included in the printed score.\n\nAn arrangement of this symphony for chamber ensemble (consisting of 2 violins, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, horn, piano 4-hands, and harmonium) was prepared in 1921 by students and associates of Arnold Schoenberg, for the Viennese \"Society for Private Musical Performances\": Hanns Eisler (1st and 3rd movements), Erwin Stein (2nd mvt.), and Karl Rankl (4th mvt.). The Society folded before the arrangement could be performed, and it was not premiered until more than 60 years later.\n\nThe symphony requires the following orchestra:\n\nUsed in the 2nd and 4th movements only.\n\nExcept for the third movement where the timpani figure prominently, use of percussion in the symphony is extremely limited. A timpani roll enters at the coda of the first movement. In some performance editions, the timpani re-enters along with cymbals and triangle together in the climax of the second movement (the only movement employing cymbals and triangle). Many conductors perform the second movement without percussion (as in the Haas edition), however; the decision is generally settled by the performers' preferences. In the last movement, the timpani rolls in brief climaxes before crescendoing with orchestral tutti in the final bars.\n\nThe first commercial recording was made by Oskar Fried with the Berlin State Opera Orchestra in 1924 for Polydor. Along with Symphony No. 4, the Seventh is the most popular Bruckner symphony both in the concert hall and on record.\n\nHerbert von Karajan's last recording with the Vienna Philharmonic, 23 April 1989, three months before his death, on the Deutsche Grammophon label, of the Haas edition of the 1885 score, has been singled out by Norman Lebrecht as #80 in his list of the 100 best recordings, and described as \"more human and vulnerable\" than his earlier Berlin recording. In reviewing the 1999 recording by Kurt Sanderling, the critic David Hurwitz listed as reference (benchmark) recordings of Bruckner's Seventh those by Eugen Jochum in 1976, Bernard Haitink in 1978, Karajan in 1989, and Günter Wand in 1999. Stephen Johnson prefers Karl Böhm's recording with the Vienna Philharmonic, saying that Böhm balances \"clear-sighted formal understanding with a more fluid, supple approach to phrasing.\" The vast majority of modern recordings use vibrato for the strings, with Roger Norrington's recording with the Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart des SWR being a notable exception.\n\nOn BBC Radio 3 in December 2014, John Deathridge selected Bernard Haitink's Concertgebouw recording from 1966 as the 'First Choice' in the 'Building a Library' series. (Wilhelm Furtwangler's 1949 recording with the Berlin Philharmonic was chosen as the top 'Historic' recommendation.)\n\nThe chamber arrangement has been recorded, by among others, the Thomas Christian Ensemble, proving to one reviewer \"beyond doubt that it simply takes more than 10 musicians, no matter how good they are, to play a Bruckner symphony.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969385", "title": "C-flat major", "text": "C-flat major\n\nC-flat major (or the key of C-flat) is a major scale based on C, consisting of the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Its key signature has seven flats. The direct enharmonic equivalent of C-flat major is B major, a key signature with five sharps.\n\nThe C-flat major scale is:\nC-flat major is the only major or minor key, other than theoretical keys, which has \"flat\" or \"sharp\" in its name, but whose tonic note is the enharmonic equivalent of a natural note (a white key on a keyboard instrument).\nIts relative minor is A-flat minor (or enharmonically G-sharp minor), and its parallel minor is C-flat minor, usually replaced by B minor, since C-flat minor's three double-flats make it generally impractical to use.\n\nC-flat major is the home key of the harp, with all its pedals in the top position, and it is considered the most resonant key for the instrument. Thus, in Richard Strauss's \"Ein Heldenleben\", the first cue for the harps is written in C-flat major even though the rest of the orchestra, having previously played in E-flat major, retains a 3-flat key signature and is now playing in B major, marked with the necessary sharps and naturals as accidentals.\n\nThis use of C-flat major in harp parts when the rest of the orchestra is playing in B major is not exceptional: it is standard practice in orchestral music written in B major for harp parts to be notated in C-flat major. In Arnold Bax's symphonic poem \"Tintagel\", the key is B major and again the harp part is always notated in C-flat major; but in this case the harp's key signature contains only 6 flats, and the necessary Fs are notated with accidentals. In Claude Debussy's Sonata for Flute, Viola and Harp, the second movement has a middle section in B major, for which the harp part is notated in C-flat major with seven flats. In Reinhold Glière's Harp Concerto in E-flat major, the middle movement is a set of variations in C-flat major. Sometimes harp parts are also written in G-flat major when the rest of the orchestra is notated in F-sharp major. Harp parts can also be written in A-flat minor when the rest of the orchestra is notated in G-sharp minor.\n\nAlthough most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent B major, since it only contains five sharps as opposed to C-flat major's seven flats, the middle section of Frédéric Chopin's \"Contredanse\" in G-flat major is written in C-flat major, as are the middle (Trio) sections of two of Ernesto Nazareth's Brazilian tangos for piano, \"Chave de Ouro\" and \"Labirinto\" (both with a home key of G-flat major), as well as the final half (last two themes) of William Bolcom's rag for piano, \"Seabiscuits\".\n\nThere is a brief passage in the first movement, \"Evocación\", of \"Iberia\" by Isaac Albéniz which suggests the key of C-flat minor by adding the necessary three double-flats as accidentals. The surrounding passages are in C-flat major, with a 7-flat key signature. The movement is in sonata form, in the key of A-flat minor, so this places the second theme in the orthodox relative major key (and in the also-orthodox tonic major key of A-flat major when it reappears near the end of the piece). \n\nThe slow movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 12 has a principal theme that modulates from A-flat minor to C-flat major, before moving to what would theoretically be C-flat minor, but is notated as B minor (every note in this passage requires an accidental, due to the key signature of seven flats). A few other works by Beethoven have significant passages in C-flat major, although they usually notate this with accidentals in some other key signature, because Beethoven found C-flat major's seven flats to be a difficult key; for example:\n\nC-flat major is used for Benjamin Britten's \"Interlude\" in C-flat major for harp, several of Max Reger's Canons in All Major and Minor Keys (Book 1 Nos. 62 and 63, and Book 2 No. 48), and No. 29 from the \"Thirty Preludes in All Major and Minor Keys\" by Christian Heinrich Rinck. The first movement of Charles Koechlin's Partita for Chamber Orchestra, Op. 205, is in C-flat.\n\nIn some scores, the C-flat major key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top. This can be seen, for example, in the Albéniz example given above: Iberia, 1st movement: \"Evocación\", about two-thirds of which is in 7 flats, and every bass-clef staff of which shows this variant. This is also seen in the second movement of the Beautiful Danube waltz in the Boosey & Hawkes concert band edition.\n\n"}
{"id": "1969386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969386", "title": "Beaulieu Abbey", "text": "Beaulieu Abbey\n\nBeaulieu Abbey, , was a Cistercian abbey in Hampshire, England. It was founded in 1203–1204 by King John and (uniquely in Britain) populated by 30 monks sent from the abbey of Cîteaux in France, the mother house of the Cistercian order. The Medieval Latin name of the monastery was \"Bellus Locus Regis\" (\"The beautiful place of the king\"') or \"monasterium Belli loci Regis\". Other spellings of the English name which occur historically are Bewley (16th century) and Beaulie (17th century).\n\nThe first Abbot of Beaulieu was Hugh, who stood high in the king's favour, often served in important diplomatic missions and was later to become Bishop of Carlisle. The king granted the new abbey a rich endowment, including numerous manors spread across southern England (particularly in Berkshire), land in the New Forest, corn, large amounts of money, building materials, 120 cows, 12 bulls, a golden chalice, and an annual tun of wine. John's son and successor, King Henry III was equally generous to Beaulieu, with the result that the abbey became very wealthy, though it was far from the richest English Cistercian house.\n\nMonks from Beaulieu founded four daughter houses, Netley Abbey (1239), Hailes Abbey (1246), Newenham Abbey (1247) and St Mary Graces Abbey (1350).\n\nThe abbey's buildings were of a scale and magnificence reflecting its status as an important royal foundation. The church was a vast cruciform structure in early gothic style and heavily influenced by French churches of the order, especially those of Cîteaux, Bonport and Clairvaux. The church was long and had a semi-circular apse with 11 radiating chapels. The building took more than four decades to complete and was finally dedicated in 1246, in the presence of King Henry III and his queen, of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and of many prelates and nobles.\n\nSouth of the church stood a cloister, ranged around which were the chapter house, refectory, kitchens, storehouse and quarters for the monks, lay brothers and the abbot. A separate infirmary complex lay to the east of the main buildings, connected to them by a passage. The abbey was surrounded by workshops, farm buildings, guesthouses, a mill, and extensive gardens and fishponds. Strongly fortified gatehouses controlled entry to the monastic enclosure, which was defended by a wall. A water gate allowed access to ships in the river.\n\nPope Innocent III constituted Beaulieu an \"exempt abbey\", meaning that the abbot had to answer to no local bishop but only to the Pope himself. Beaulieu was also invested by the same Pope with special privileges of sanctuary, much stronger than usual and covering not only the abbey itself but all the 23.5 hectare precinct around as included in the original grant made by King John. As Beaulieu was the only abbey in its region with such large and strongly enforced sanctuary rights, it soon became a refuge for fugitives, both ordinary criminals and debtors and also political enemies of the government. Among these latter were Anne Neville, wife of Warwick the Kingmaker, who sought sanctuary after the Battle of Barnet (1471). Twenty-six years later, Perkin Warbeck fled to Beaulieu from the pursuing armies of Henry VII.\n\nIn 1535 the abbey's income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's general survey of church finances prior to the plunder, at £428 gross, £326 net. According to the terms of the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries, this meant that it escaped immediate confiscation, though the clouds were gathering.\n\nThe last abbot of Beaulieu was Abbot Thomas Stevens, elected in 1536, who had formerly been abbot of the recently dissolved abbey of Netley, across Southampton Water. Though Beaulieu managed to survive until April 1538, at that point it was finally forced to surrender to the government. Many of the monks were granted pensions, the abbot receiving 100 marks per year. Abbot Thomas ended his days as treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral. He died in 1550.\n\nAt the dissolution of the monastery in 1538, the Commissioners for the Dissolution reported to the government that thirty-two sanctuary-men, who were here for debt, felony, or murder, were living in houses in the monastic precincts with their wives and families. When the abbey was dissolved there was some debate about what to do with them, however, in the end it was decided, after pleading by the former abbot and certain government officials, to allow the debtors to live in their houses on the abbey grounds permanently. Pardons were given to some of the criminals too, including one Thomas Jeynes, a murderer.\n\nAfter Beaulieu fell there was much competition amongst courtiers to gain ownership of the abbey and its valuable estates, but eventually Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, won the struggle and King Henry granted him the abbey itself and 3,441 hectares of the Beaulieu lands.\n\nAs soon as he took over, Wriothesley set about building himself a house on the site. He demolished the church, as was common practice but, unusually, instead of converting the buildings around the cloister into a home he chose the great gatehouse as the core of his mansion (compare Wriothesley's other converted monastery at Titchfield Abbey or the conversion of neighbouring Netley Abbey). This survives – much extended – as the modern country house at Beaulieu known as Palace House. Lord Southampton preserved the monks' refectory, which he gave to the people of Beaulieu village to be their parish church, a function it still serves today. The west range of the abbey, known as the Domus, was also saved. The rest of the abbey was allowed to fall into ruin.\n\nAlthough a great deal was destroyed at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, there is still much to see. The groundplan of the 102-metre-long church can be seen on the lawns. The position of the altar is marked by a cross and flanking trees. The Domus, once the lay brothers' refectory and lodgings and, later, chambers for important guests once the lay brothers had vanished, now houses an exhibition of monastic life prior to Thomas Wriothesley's takeover. Visitors can view a series of modern embroidered wall hangings made by Belinda, Lady Montagu, depicting scenes from medieval monastic life and the history of the abbey since 1204. The abbey refectory survives as the parish church and there are substantial ruins of the other buildings round the cloister. The abbey cloister is a place of tranquillity, planted with fragrant herbs. Beaulieu remains in the hands of the descendants of Wriothesley, who still live there.\n\nThe Abbey is open to the public as part of the visitor attraction known as \"Beaulieu\", which includes:\n\n\nThe Domus is regularly used for events, dining and corporate hospitality.\n\nBeaulieu Abbey was the sole religious foundation of King John. The legend of this event, first told in a Kirkstall chartulary, is related by the antiquarian William Dugdale, who incorrectly suggested that \"King John being offended with the Cistercian order in England, and the Abbots of that Order coming to him to reconcile themselves, he caused them to be trod under his Horses Feet, for which Action being terrified in a Dream, he built and bestowed the Abby of Beau-lieu in Newforest for 30 monks of that order.\" The legend was repeated in a later work by the topographer Thomas Cox. Modern re-tellings of the king's \"babbling dream\" state that he dreamed of being scourged with rods and thongs by the abbots he had commanded be trampled and he awoke to find his body still ached from the blows in his dream. The king is said to have taken great interest in the construction of the abbey and even to have expressed a desire to be entombed beneath the high altar.\n\nBeaulieu, according to the official website, is one of the most haunted places in Britain, with reported sightings going back over a hundred years.\n\nThe sound of Gregorian chant, considered an omen by local tradition, have been reported by Mrs Elizabeth Varley, daughter of John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, and Michael C. Sedgwick, former curator of the National Motor Museum, amongst others.\n\nAmong the many sightings of white and brown clad monks in the abbey ruins and in the parish church, including one by the actress Margaret Rutherford, is an often repeated tale involving a group of local boys sheltering from a storm in a disused boathouse who see a rowing boat making for the shore.\n\nParish priest Reverend Robert Frazer Powles, vicar of Beaulieu (1886–1939) claimed to have conversed with the ghostly monks, who he knew by name, and even held candlelit midnight mass every Christmas Eve for them.\n\nBeaulieu Abbey is the setting of the opening chapters in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel \"The White Company\".\n\nF. T. Prince's poem \"At Beaulieu\"', from his 1963 collection, \"The Doors of Stone\", describes the double heart-coffin on display in the Abbey. Prince, who was Professor of English at the University of Southampton from 1957 to 1974, probably visited the site sometime in the late 1950s/early 1960s.\n\nSir John Betjeman's poem \"Youth and Age on Beaulieu River\" is based on a visit he made to the New Forest.\n\nFurthermore, Beaulieu Abbey plays a prominent role in Edward Rutherfurd's epic novel \"The Forest\" through hundreds of years.\n\nThe abbey's status as \"one of the most haunted places in Britain\" has drawn a number TV productions there.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969388", "title": "Boliden AB", "text": "Boliden AB\n\nBoliden AB is a Swedish mining and smelting company focusing on production of copper, zinc, lead, gold and silver. Following a series of acquisitions during the 1980s and 1990s the company acquired mining and smelting assets of the Finnish mining and smelting company Outokumpu in 2003. Outokumpu acquired the subsidiary Boliden Contech and Boliden's copper and zinc divisions. As a consequence of the deal, Outokumpu ended up controlling 49 percent of the Boliden shares.\n\nThe company has approximately 4,500 employees. The name comes from the Boliden mine, some 30 km northwest of the Swedish town of Skellefteå, where gold was found in 1924. It was once Europe's largest and richest gold mine, but since 1967 the mine has been defunct.\n\nBusiness Area Mines conducts exploration, mining and milling operations in Sweden and Ireland. Its main products are zinc and copper concentrate, with some lead, gold and silver content. The goods produced are sold both to the Group's own smelters and to external customers. Boliden owns and operates Europe's biggest zinc mine at Tara in Ireland. Tara became part of Boliden in early 2004, but production began there in 1977, since when over 60 million tonnes of ore have been mined. Boliden also owns Garpenberg, which is Sweden's oldest mine still in operation. Mining at Garpenberg began back in the 13th century. The mineral-rich Skellefte field lies within the Boliden Area, where almost 30 mines have been opened since production began in the 1920s and where Boliden currently operates the Renström and Kristineberg underground mines and the Maurliden open pit mine. Boliden also owns and operates the Aitik open pit mine, which is one of Europe's biggest copper mines. Metal grades at Aitik are low, but this is compensated for by high productivity levels and efficient milling processes that also exploit the ore's gold and silver content. An expansion project that will double Aitik's ore production to 36 million tonnes per annum by 2014 began in 2007 and will be completed in 2010.\n\nBusiness Area Smelters refines both metal concentrate and secondary materials to produce base and precious metals at smelters in Sweden, Finland and Norway. The main metals are zinc and copper but the production of lead, gold and silver also makes a substantial contribution to the Business Area's revenues. Other products include sulphuric acid and aluminium fluoride. Boliden owns and operates two zinc and two copper smelters and one lead smelter. The Kokkola zinc smelter in Finland is the second largest in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, and mainly produces an alloy used in the galvanising of thin sheet metal. The Odda zinc smelter, which produces zinc for the steel industry and aluminium fluoride for Norway's aluminium industry, is located on the west coast of Norway. The Rönnskär copper smelter is located in the Swedish town of Skelleftehamn and its main products are copper, zinc clinker, lead and precious metals. The smelter, which produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of its operations, also produces metals from electronic scrap and other secondary materials. The Harjavalta copper smelter, located on the west coast of Finland, produces copper cathodes that are mainly sold to manufacturers of semi-finished goods. Other important products include gold, silver and sulphuric acid. The Bergsöe lead smelter outside Landskrona in southern Sweden extracts lead from scrap car batteries. Bergsöe is one of Europe's four biggest players in the lead recycling industry. Approximately 60 per cent of the plant's lead production is sold to the European battery industry, with the remainder used in the manufacture of roofing sheet.\n\nOn 10 December 1924, a sensational ore deposit was discovered at Fågelmyran, just over 30 km northwest of Skellefteå. Test drilling revealed what was then Europe's richest ore. The first Boliden ore was extracted in the spring of 1926 at what would become the Boliden mine – a mine that would prove, over the course of several decades, to be Europe's biggest and richest gold mine. The deposit also included copper and large amounts of silver. The town of Boliden quickly grew up around the mine.\nThe leading light in the development of the Boliden company was Oscar Falkman (1877–1961), who was the driving force behind the exploration work that began in the second decade of the 20th century, and which was accelerated due to the metal shortage that arose in the wake of World War I. Falkman continued in the role of Boliden's President until 1941. Boliden AB was also part of the financier Ivar Kreuger's business empire until 1932.\nThe Rönnskär smelter was built to process the Boliden ore, and commenced smelting operations in 1930.\nThe world's longest ore tramway, between Boliden's mine in Kristineberg and Boliden became operational in 1943. The ore tramway was 96 km long and by the time it was shut down, 44 years later, it had transported 12 million tonnes of concentrate.\nOperations started at the Aitik mine, outside Gällivare, in 1968. This open pit mine would develop, over the years, into one of Europe's biggest copper mines. During its first year of operations, it produced approximately 9,000 tonnes of copper, 160 kg of gold and 7 tonnes of silver.\n\nThe company grew during the first few years of the 1970s thanks to a joint venture with the German company, Preussag. This led to the expansion of Boliden's lead smelting and refining capacity, and in 1976, Boliden launched a Kaldo type furnace, for processing metals. 1976 also saw Boliden launch the first flash smelting furnace for lead, applying Kaldo technology, at Rönnskär.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Boliden exported a total of 20,000 tonnes of metallic residues from the Rönnskär smelter to a Chilean company, Promel, for processing. Boliden paid Promel for processing work that was never carried out and the residues were, instead, stored on the outskirts of the town of Arica at a site which was converted to a low-cost residential area in the 1990s on the instructions of the social services. The residents were unaware of the waste's presence and as a result, many people came to harm. In the autumn of 2009, the Chilean government announced that the 7,000 or so residents of the area would be evacuated. The waste was exported before the Basel Convention prohibiting the export of environmentally hazardous waste came into force.\n\nAt the end of 1986, the Trelleborg industrial conglomerate acquired a controlling interest in Boliden. The same year also saw Boliden acquire the Spanish company, Apirsa S.L., which extracted zinc from the Aznalcóllar open pit mine, 45 km west of Seville.\nTrelleborg launched a major restructuring of the Boliden Group in 1996, and the new company, Boliden Limited, was formed in Toronto. Two years later, Boliden Ltd. bought the Canadian company Westmin.\n\nOn 25 April 1998, the tailings dam at Apirsa's Los Frailes mine burst and 4.5 million cubic metres of tailings sand drained out into the nearby Guadiamar river, near Doñana National Park, causing the worst environmental accident in Spain so far. Extensive investigations revealed defects in both the dam's original construction and in subsequent construction projects. The company reacted quickly to the situation and immediately began a comprehensive programme of reclamation work. In 2006, Boliden lost the demand against the companies that built the dam Aznalcóllar. The Spanish Supreme Court also confirmed that Boliden should pay 43,7 million euros to the Spanish government. The recovery costs of Aznalcóllar are estimated to be 240 million euro; Boliden has not assumed any part of these costs.\n\nIn 1999, Boliden implemented a restructuring programme at Group level and the Boliden share was listed on the Stockholm stock exchange.\n\nIn 2001, Boliden's head office was relocated back to Sweden.\n\nIn late 2003, Boliden bought smelters and a mine from the Finnish steel group, Outokumpu, and as a result, the Kokkola and Harjavalta/Pori smelters in Finland and the Odda smelter in Norway became part of Boliden. The purchase also included the Tara zinc mine in Ireland.\n\n2006\nDecision to invest in an expansion of the Aitik mine. Agreement with OM Group Inc (OMG) regarding the refining of nickel concentrate at Harjavalta. Successful exploration resulted in increases to Garpenberg's ore reserves. A new lead section was also opened at Bergsöe.\n\n2005\nKvarnberget is the name given to a new mineralisation discovered in Garpenberg. Decision to invest in expansion of the Harjavalta smelter. Feasibility study of possible expansion of the Aitik mine. Boliden sells its shares in Breakwater Resources and Lundin Mining. First edition of Boliden's in-house magazine, \"Boliden Magazine\", published.\n\n2004\nNew Boliden is created through the structural transaction with Outokumpu. Work begins on creating Boliden's new strategic platform – the New Boliden Way (NBW). The Odda zinc smelter is modernised.\n\n2003\nBoliden acquires Outokumpu's mining and smelting operations and sells its Fabrication and Technology Sales operations to Outokumpu.\n\n2001\nA fourth expansion takes place at Kokkola, increasing capacity to 260,000 tonnes per year, making it one of the world's biggest zinc smelters.\n\n2000\nHarjavalta's nickel operations are sold. Maurliden, the 28th mine in the Boliden Area, opens. The new Rönnskär complex is inaugurated.\n\n1998\nThe Spanish Los Frailes mine closes as a result of the tailings dam failure, causing extensive damage in the environment, near Doñana National Park. The Rönnskär +200 expansion – an investment of SEK 1.9 billion – is approved. The direct leaching method is implemented at Kokkola.\n\n1997\nBoliden establishes its head office in Toronto. The share is listed on the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges.\n\n1995\nHarjavalta is expanded, increasing copper production by 60 per cent and nickel production by 200 per cent.\n\n1993\nThe “copper shuttle” train begins transporting copper cathodes from Skelleftehamn to Elektrokoppar in Helsingborg.\n\n1990\nThe concentrator at Boliden is expanded and modernised. The Outokumpu Group is incorporated, and the zinc smelter becomes known as Outokumpu Zinc Oy and the copper and nickel smelters as Outokumpu Harjavalta Metals Oy.\n\n1988\nThe Spanish mining company, Apirsa SL, becomes a subsidiary of Boliden.\n\n1987\nThe Swedish industrial conglomerate, Trelleborg AB, takes a controlling interest in Boliden.\n\n1979\nBoliden buys Paul Bergsöe & Son.\n\n1977\nProduction starts at the Irish zinc mine, Tara.\n\n1970\nProduction of aluminium fluoride begins at Odda. In Ireland, Tara discovers the big zinc and lead deposit.\n\n1969\nOperations begin at the zinc smelter in Kokkola.\n\n1968\nMining operations start at Aitik.\n\n1967\nThe Boliden mine is closed down. Outokumpu decides to establish its own zinc smelter in Kokkola.\n\n1964\nBoliden buys half of the shares in the Norwegian zinc smelter, Det Norske Zinkkompani A/S (Odda).\n\n1957\nBoliden acquires the Garpenberg mine from Zinkgruvor AB.\n\n1955\nThe world's deepest railway – between the Långsele and Boliden mines – is completed.\n\n1952\nConstruction of a sulphuric acid plant at Rönnskär to exploit the sulphur dioxide-bearing chimney gases.\n\n1949\nThe flash smelting method is introduced at Harjavalta.\n\n1946\nBoliden publishes Sweden's first in-house magazine, “Smältdegeln” [The Melting Pot].\n\n1945\nCopper production starts at Harjavalta.\n\n1943\nThe 96-kilometre ore tramway between Kristineberg and Boliden opens. Tin and lead smelting starts at Bergsöe.\n\n1942\nLead plant built at Rönnskär. Paul Bergsöe & Son AB formed in Landskrona.\n\n1940\nOperations start at the Kristineberg mine.\n\n1939\nOutokumpu Oy starts extracting zinc concentrate from Outokumpu ore.\n\n1931\nThe two mining companies – Västerbottens Gruvaktiebolag and Skellefteås Gruvaktiebolag – are merged to form Bolidens Gruvaktiebolag.\n\n1930\nOperations start at the Rönnskär smelter.\n\n1929\nZinc production begins at Odda. The first ore train to Rönnskär leaves Boliden on 24 September.\n\n1925\nVästerbottens Gruvaktiebolag and Skellefteå Gruvaktiebolag are formed.\n\n1924\nGold discovered at Fågelmyran in Boliden.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Boliden was involved in a dumping controversy in Chile. According to Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, \"Boliden shipped approximately 20,000 tonnes of smelter sludge to the Polygono area in Arica between 1984 and 1985. The waste derived from Boliden’s Rönnskär arsenic plant in Sweden and was sold to a Chilean company, Promel, for processing. However, the waste was reportedly left unprocessed and unprotected at the site until 1998. Starting in 1989, housing developments were built nearby, but Chilean authorities concluded in 2009 that the area should be evacuated as it remained contaminated.\"\n\nThe Boliden controversy in Chile stirred debate in the Swedish news in 2013, after 700 Chilean victims suffering from arsenic poisoning filed a lawsuit against Boliden.\n\nSee also the Doñana disaster, caused by negligence on the part of Boliden-Apirsa.\n\nIn 2016, Boliden was ranked as being among the 13th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in the Arctic.\n\nThe Aitik copper mine (a major mine within the company) was featured on a 2007 episode of the Discovery Channel series \"\"Really Big Things\"\".\n\nReleased in 2014, Swedish director Roy Andersson's film \"A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\" includes a controversial scene which, according to the director, refers to Boliden's involvement in dumping dangerous toxins in the Chilean city Arica in the 1980s. In a review of the film, film critic Jessica Kiang describes the scene: \"And in probably the most unsettling and memorable scene, which plays out like a live action Monty Python animation, colonial-era British soldiers pack a huge brass drum outfitted with trumpet horns of varying sizes with chained black slaves. The door is closed, and a fire is lit beneath the drum, which begins to revolve slowly (it is emblazoned with the name of Swedish mining giant Boliden) and to emit a kind of music. All this, it is revealed, is being enacted for the entertainment of a group of elderly rich, champagne-sipping white people in evening wear.\"\n\nThe smelting victims in Arica is also the topic of \"Toxic Playground\", a Swedish documentary by William Johansson and Lars Edman released in 2009.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969415", "title": "Dewan", "text": "Dewan\n\nDewan (also known as diwan, sometimes spelled devan or divan) designated a powerful government official, minister, or ruler. A \"dewan\" was the head of a state institution of the same name (see Divan). Diwans belonged to the elite families in the history of Mughal and post-Mughal India and held high posts within the government.\n\nThe word is Persian in origin and was loaned into Arabic. The original meaning was \"bundle (of written sheets)\", hence \"book\", especially \"book of accounts,\" and hence \"office of accounts,\" \"custom house,\" \"council chamber\". The meaning of the word, \"divan\" \"long, cushioned seat\" is due to such seats having been found along the walls in Middle Eastern council chambers. It is a common surname among Sikhs in Punjab. \n\nThe word first appears under the Caliphate of Omar I (A.D. 634–644). As the Caliphate state became more complicated, the term was extended over all the government bureaus.\nThe \"divan of the Sublime Porte\" was the council or Cabinet of the state. In the Ottoman Empire, it consisted of the usually (except in the Sultan's presence) presiding Grand Vizier and other viziers, and occasionally the Janissary Ağa.\n\nIn 19th-century Romania, the Ad hoc Divan was a body which played a role in the country's development towards independence from Ottoman rule.\n\nIn Javanese and related languages, the cognate \"dewan\" is the standard word for council, as in the Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat or (Indonesia's Council of People's Representatives) and Dewan Negara (Senate of Malaysia).\n\nDuring the effective rule of Mughal India, the \"Dewan\" served as the chief revenue officer of a province.\n\nLater, when most vassal states gained various degrees of self-determination, the finance — and/or chief minister and leader of many princely states (especially Muslim, but also many Hindu, including Baroda, Hyderabad, Mysore, Kochi, Travancore — referred to as \"Dalawa\" until 1811) became known as a \"dewan\".\n\nExceptionally, a ruler was himself titled Dewan or a loftier variation, notably: \n\nAs a title used in various Early Modern Indian states, \"Diwan\" denoted the highest officials in the court after the king; the suffix -ji is added as a mark of respect in India. In the major Maratha states of Baroda (ruled by the Gaekwad), Gwalior (ruled by Scindias or Shinde), Indore (ruled by Holkar), and Nagpur (ruled by Bhonsle, but not from the Chhatrapati Shivaji family), the highest officer after the king was called the Diwan.\n\nOne of the examples – Shrimant Diwan/Rao Bahadur Atmaram Kulkarni, was the Diwan (Prime Minister) of Maratha Jamkhandi State. In the 19th century, the British Parliament established in British India a supreme court for revenue matters (non-criminal matters) named the \"Sudder Dewanny Adawlut\", which applied Hindu law.\n\nDewan, Diwan, Divan, or Deo was the hereditary title borne by the Chief Minister of the Hindu Cooch State in the Bengal region.\n\nDiwan also became a surname of high-caste Hindus or Sikhs in the Punjab region.\n\nThere is also a community with the surname Diwan found in Chhattisgarh, near the Bilaspur and Janjgir-Champa regions. This is a Brahmin community descendant from Dubey pandits who migrated from Purvanchal in Uttar Pradesh. The males in this community take the title Dhar (eg. Mohan Dhar Diwan, a high-ranked member of Vishwa Hindu Parishad).\n\nAfter the Battle of Buxar, when Bengal was annexed by the East India Company in 1764, the Mughal Emperor granted the Company the \"Diwani\" (the right to collect revenue) in Bengal and Bihar in 1765. The term \"Diwani\" thus referred to British (fiscal) suzerainty over parts of India during the early British Raj.\n\nIn French India, one of its constituent colonies, Yanaon, had Zamindar and Diwan. They were active in its local and municipal administration during French rule. The Zamindar of Yanam was given a 4-gun salute by French counterparts.\n\n\nThe document dated Bikram Samvat 1833 Bhadra Vadi 3 Roj 6 (i.e. Friday 2 August 1776), shows that Vamsharaj Pande and Swaroop Singh Karki had carried the title of Dewan (equivalent to Prime Minister) of the Kingdom of Nepal.\n\n\n"}

Outside of Iceland, they are known among music collectors for their rare releases on Parlophone, sung in English and recorded in London for export. The most famous of these is the 1966 EP \"Umbarumbamba\", regarded as one of the rarest released records in the world and known to fetch prices into the thousands of dollars when a copy surfaces. Their style can be described as garage rock, fuzz rock, and freakbeat, with noticeable influences from both The Who and The Beatles.\n\nFormed in Keflavik in 1963 under the name Hljómar (literally \"\"Chords\"\"), they soon became popular in Iceland at a time when local rock music was a rarity. By the mid-1960s they were recording in London on Parlophone Records for the international market, including the legendary EP \"Umbarumbamba\", now a valuable collector's item. This record was recorded as a tie-in with a movie starring the band also entitled \"Umbarumbamba\", but the film was not a success. From these sessions also came the singles \"Once\" and \"If You Knew\". The band even attempted a single entitled \"Stay\" in the United States on Columbia Records, which was produced by John Simon, known for his work with The Band and Big Brother and the Holding Company's album \"Cheap Thrills\" with Janis Joplin.\n\nIn 1969 a number of Thor's Hammer members went on to form the prog-flavored band Trúbrot, which recorded four albums until itself splitting in 1973.\n\nContinual interest in the band among collectors of 1960s rock music lead to the 2001 Ace Records compilation album \"From Keflavik With Love\", which collects all of the band's English-language output, including the tracks from \"Umbarumbamba\", \"Once\", \"If You Knew\", and \"Stay\", as well as a number of their Icelandic tracks.\n\nRúnar Júlíusson died on 5 December 2008 at the age of 63 after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nThor's Hammer should not be confused with the American metal band Thorr's Hammer, or the Polish NSBM band also named \"Thor's Hammer\". None of the three are related. The group's collected work is featured on the anthology, From Keflavík, With Love, released in 2001 on Big Beat Records.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1969440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969440", "title": "Fluctuating asymmetry", "text": "Fluctuating asymmetry\n\nAs a form of biological asymmetry, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect bilateral symmetry. This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry. Examples of FA in the human body include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, breasts, testicles, and thighs.\n\nResearch has exposed multiple factors that are associated with FA. As measuring FA can indicate developmental stability, it can also suggest the genetic fitness of an individual. This can further have an effect on mate attraction and sexual selection, as less asymmetry reflects greater developmental stability and subsequent fitness. Human physical health is also associated with FA. For example, young men with greater FA report more medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. Multiple other factors can be linked to FA, such as intelligence and personality traits.\n\nFluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be measured by the equation: Mean FA = mean absolute value of left sides - mean absolute value of right sides.\n\nThe closer the mean value is to zero, the lower the levels of FA, indicating more symmetrical features. By taking many measurements of multiple traits per individual, this increases the accuracy in determining that individual's developmental stability. However, these traits must be chosen carefully, as different traits are affected by different selection pressures.\n\nThis equation can further be used to study the distribution of asymmetries at population levels, to distinguish between traits that show FA, directional asymmetry, and anti-symmetry. The distribution of FA around a mean point of zero suggests that FA is not an adaptive trait, where symmetry is ideal. Directional asymmetry of traits can be distinguished by showing significantly biased measurements towards traits being larger on either the left or right sides, for example, human testicles (where the right is more commonly larger), or handedness (85% are right handed, 15% are left handed). Anti-symmetry can be distinguished by the bimodal distributions, due to some adaptive functions.\n\nFluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often considered to be the product of developmental stress and instability, caused by both genetic and environmental stressors. The notion that FA is a result of genetic and environmental factors is supported by Waddington's notion of canalisation, which implies that FA is a measure of the genome's ability to successfully buffer development to achieve a normal phenotype under imperfect environmental conditions. Various factors causing developmental instability and FA include infections, mutations, and toxins.\n\nResearch on twins suggests that there are genetic influences on FA, and increased levels of mutations and perturbations is also linked to greater asymmetry.\n\nFA may also result from a lack of genetic immunity to diseases, as those with higher FA show less effective immune responses. This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections. Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA. However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved.\n\nThere is some speculation that inbreeding contributes towards FA. One study on ants demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, the differences were not significant. Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly higher FA than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen.\n\nMultiple sources provide information on environmental factors that are correlated with FA. A meta-analysis of related studies suggests that FA is an appropriate marker of environmental stress during development.\n\nSome evidence suggests that poverty and lack of food during development may contribute to greater levels of FA. Infectious diseases can also lead to FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with higher FA report more infections. Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be due to a lack of immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of oxidative stress. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants. Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development.\n\nToxins and poisons are considered to increase FA. Pregnancy sickness is argued to be an adaptation for avoiding toxins during foetal development. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows higher FA (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual. Greater exposure to pollution may also be a fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of Baltic grey seals (\"Halichoerus grypus\") demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry. Also, shrews (\"Crocidura russula)\" from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry. Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as mice (\"Apodemus flavicollis\") living closer to the failed Chernobyl reactor show greater asymmetry.\n\nDevelopmental stability is achieved when an organism is able to withstand genetic and environmental stress, to display the bilaterally symmetrical traits determined by its developmentally programmed phenotype. To measure an individual's developmental stability, the FA measurements of 10 traits are added together, including ear width, elbows, ankles, wrists, feet, length of ears and fingers. This is achieved by: (L - R)trait 1 + (L - R)trait 2 + ...(L - R)trait 10. This provides a good overall measure of body FA, as every individual has some features that are not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nCommon environmental pressures leading to lower developmental stability include exposure to toxins, poison and infectious diseases, low food quality and malnutrition. Genetic pressures include spontaneous new mutations, and \"bad genes\" (genes that once had adaptive functions, but are being removed through evolutionary selection). A large fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and a low developmental stability suggests that an organism is unable to develop according to the ideal state of bilateral symmetry. The energy required for bilateral symmetry development is extremely high, making fully perfect bilateral symmetry functionally nonexistent in natural organic creatures. Energy is invested into survival in spite of the genetic and environmental pressures, before making bilaterally symmetrical traits. Research has also revealed links between FA and depression, genetic or environmental stress and measures of mate quality for sexual selection.\n\nResearch has linked higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) to poorer outcomes in some domains of physical health in humans. For example, one study found that individuals with higher levels of FA report a higher number of medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA. However, they did not experience worse outcomes in areas such as systolic blood pressure or cholesterol levels. Higher levels of FA have also been linked to higher body mass index (BMI) in women, and lower BMI in men. Research has shown that both men and women with higher levels of FA, both facial and bodily, report a higher number of respiratory infections and a higher number of days ill, compared to men and women with lower levels of FA. In men, higher levels of FA have been linked to lower levels of physical attractiveness and higher levels of oxidative stress, regardless of smoking or levels of toxin exposure. There is no gender difference in the susceptibility of diseases depending on body FA.\n\nA large-scale review of the human and non-human literature by Møller found that higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry were linked to increased vulnerability to parasites, and also to lower levels of immunity to disease. A large-scale longitudinal study in Britain found that facial FA was not associated with poorer health over the course of childhood, which was interpreted as suggesting smaller effects of FA in Western societies with generally low levels of FA A review of the relationship between various attractiveness features and health in Western societies produced similar results, finding that symmetry was not related to health in either sex, but was related to attractiveness in males.\n\nIt has been suggested that individuals with lower levels of FA may engage in more biologically costly behaviours such as recreational drug use and risky body modifications such as piercings and tattoos. These ideas have been proposed in the context of Zahavi's handicap principle, which argues that highly costly behaviours or traits serve as signals of an organism's genetic quality. The relationship between FA and behaviours with high health risks has received mixed support. Individuals with body piercings and tattoos (which increase risk of blood-borne infections) have been shown to have lower levels of FA, but individuals with lower FA do not engage in any more recreational drug use than those with higher FA levels.\n\nHigher levels of FA have been linked to higher levels of some mental health difficulties. For instance, it has been shown that, among university students, higher FA is associated with higher levels of schizotypy. Depression scores have been found to be higher in men, but not women, with higher levels of FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced higher levels of psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced higher levels of depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had higher levels of FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower levels of FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the highest levels of psychopathy were found to have similar levels of FA to non-offenders.\n\nResearch has also linked FA to conditions such as lower back pain, although the evidence is mixed. While one study found no notable link between pelvic asymmetry and lower back pain, other studies have found pelvic asymmetry (as well as FA in other traits not directly related to pelvic function) to be higher in patients experiencing lower back pain, and higher levels of FA have also been linked to congenital spinal problems. Studies have also shown increased levels of FA of ear length in individuals with cleft lip and/or non-syndromic cleft palate syndrome.<ref name=\"FA and CL/CP\"></ref>\n\nIn addition to general health and susceptibility to disease, research has also studied the link between FA and physical fitness. Research has found that lower levels of lower-body FA is associated with faster running speeds in Jamaican sprinters, and individuals with greater body asymmetry have been shown to move more asymmetrically while running, although do not experience higher metabolic costs than more symmetrical individuals. It has also been shown that children with lower levels of lower-body FA have faster sprinting speeds and are more willing to sprint when followed up in adulthood.\n\nThe relationship between FA, health and susceptibility to disease has also been studied in non-human animals. For example, studies have found that higher levels of facial asymmetry are associated with poorer overall health in female rhesus macaques (\"Macaca mulatta\"), and that higher FA is also linked to more health issues in chimpanzees (\"Pan troglodytes\").\n\nThe link between FA and health has also been investigated in non-primates. In three gazelle species (\"Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas\"), for instance, FA has been linked to a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined. It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (\"Cervus elaphus hispanicus\"), higher FA was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age.<ref name=\"FA and antler size/body mass\"></ref>\n\nFA and health outcomes have been examined within insect populations. For instance, it has been found that Mediterranean field crickets (\"Gryllus bimaculatus\") with higher levels of FA in three hind-limb traits have lower encapsulation rates, but do not differ from low-FA crickets in lytic activity (both are measures of immunocompetence). While research on the relationship between FA and longevity is sparse in humans, some studies using non-human populations have suggested an association between the symmetry of an organism and its lifespan. For instance, it has been found that flies whose wing veins showed more bilateral symmetry live longer than less symmetrical flies. This difference was greatest for male flies.\n\nSymmetry has been shown to affect physical attractiveness. Those with lower levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) are often rated as more attractive. Various studies have supported this. The relationship between FA and mate attraction has been studied in both males and females. As FA reflects developmental stability and quality, it has been suggested that we prefer those as more attractive/with low FA because it signals traits such as health and intelligence.\n\nResearch has shown that the female partners of men with lower levels of FA experience a higher number of copulatory orgasms, compared to the female partners of males with higher levels of FA. Other studies have also found that the voices of men and women with low fluctuating asymmetry are rated as more attractive, suggesting that voice may be indicative of developmental stability. Research has shown attractiveness ratings of men's scent are negatively correlated with FA, but FA is unrelated to attractiveness ratings for women's scent, and women's preferences for the scent of more symmetric men appears limited to the most fertile phases of the menstrual cycle. However, research has failed to find changes in women's preferences for low FA across the menstrual cycle when assessing pictures of faces, as opposed to scents. Facial symmetry has been positively correlated with higher occurrences of mating. Also, one study used 3-D scans of male and female bodies, and showed videos of these scans to a group of individuals who rated the bodies on attractiveness. It was found that, for both males and females, lower levels of FA were associated with higher attractiveness ratings. It was also found that sex-typical joint configurations were rated as more attractive and linked to lower FA in men, but not women. Men with higher FA have been shown to have higher levels of oxidative stress and lower levels of attractiveness. Research has also provided evidence that FA is linked to extra-pair copulation, as women have been shown to prefer men with lower levels of FA as extra-pair partners. However, the literature is mixed regarding the relationship between attractiveness and FA. For example, in one study, altering images of faces to in a way that reduced asymmetry led to observers rating such faces as less, rather than more, attractive. Research by Van Dongen also found FA to be unrelated to attractiveness, physical strength and level of masculinity in both men and women.\nMany non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese scorpionflies. In the dark-winged damselfly (\"Calopteryx maculate\"), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males, while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights. Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success. Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females. In red deer, sexual selection has affected antler development, in that larger and more symmetrical antlers are favoured in males at prime mating age.\n\nHowever, some evidence for the effects of sexual selection of FA levels have been inconsistent, suggesting that the relationship between FA and sexual selection may be more complex than originally thought. For instance, in the lekking black grouse and red junglefowl, no correlations were found between FA and mating success. Furthermore, when manipulating paradise whydahs' tails to be more and less symmetrical, females showed no preferences for more symmetrical tails (but they did show preferences for longer tails).\n\nThrough research, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been found to have a negative correlation to measurements of human traits such as working memory and intelligence, such that individuals showing greater asymmetry have lower IQ scores. As FA links with both intelligence and facial attractiveness, it is possible that our perceptions of attractiveness have evolved based upon developmental quality, which includes traits such as intelligence and health. However, some literature shows no such correlations between FA and intelligence. A meta-analysis of the research covering this topic demonstrated that whilst published studies largely report negative correlations, unpublished studies often find no association between FA and intelligence.\n\nResearch into FA suggests that there may be some correlation to specific personality factors, in particular, the Big Five personality traits. From a general view, one would expect someone who is more symmetrical (usually meaning greater attractiveness), to be high on agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion and openness, and low on neuroticism. One of the most consistent findings reported is that low FA is positively associated with measures of extraversion, suggesting that more symmetrical people tend to be more extraverted than less symmetrical individuals, particularly when specifying to symmetry within the face. A correlation has also been reported between FA and human social dominance. However, research is proving less consistent with other personality factors, with some finding some weak correlations between low FA and conscientiousness and openness to experience, and others finding no significant differences between those with high or low FA.\n\nSome studies suggest a link between FA and aggression, but the evidence is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders. However, other studies report that human males with higher FA show less physical aggression and less anger. Females show no association between FA and physical aggression, but some research has suggested that older female adolescents with higher facial FA are less hostile. The type of aggression being studied may account for the mixed evidence that is seen here. For example, one study found that females with higher FA demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation.\n\nResearch is also mixed in other animals. In Japanese scorpionflies (\"Panorpa nipponensis\" and \"Panorpa ochraceopennis\"), FA differences between members of the same sex competing for food determines the outcome of interspecific contests and aggression better than body size or ownership of food. Furthermore, cannibalistic laying hens (\"Gallus gallus domesticus\") demonstrate more asymmetry than normal hens. However, this link between FA and aggression in hens is questionable, as victimised hens also showed greater asymmetry. Furthermore, when prenatally injecting hen eggs with excess serotonin (5-HT), the hens later exhibited more FA at 18 weeks of age, but displayed less aggressive behaviours. It is suggested that the stress introduced during early embryonic stages via certain factors (such as excess serotonin) may create developmental instability, causing phenotypic and behavioural variations (such as increased or decreased aggression).\n\nIn old age, facial symmetry has been associated with better cognitive aging, as lower levels of FA have been associated with higher intelligence and more efficient information processing in older men. However, it has been found that risk of mortality cannot be predicted accurately from levels of FA in photographs of older adults.\n\nAdditionally, FA has been shown to predict atypical asymmetry of the brain. Research has also shown that growth rates after birth positively correlate with FA. For example, increased FA has been found in people who were currently obese.\n\n"}

The first two were minions of Killmonger, an enemy of Black Panther. The third was a short-lived Ghost Rider villain. The fourth villain bearing the name Malice was a somewhat alternative personality of Susan Richards of the Fantastic Four. The last two villains bearing the name Malice are disembodied entities, the first of which became an evil doppelganger of Sue Richards who was absorbed into her own mind and the second is a mutant appearing in X-Men comics.\n\nLupita Nyong'o portrays Nakia in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film \"Black Panther\" (2018).\n\nThe first Malice was one of Killmonger's mutated allies during his vie for the throne of Wakanda. Her first appearance was in \"Jungle Action\", Vol. 2, #8 (Jan 1974). She fought T'Challa, the Black Panther alongside Venomm, Lord Karnaj, Baron Macabre, and others. She was a Wakandan mutate with superhuman strength, speed, and agility and was eventually defeated along with the rest of the villains attempting the coup.\n\nA second Black Panther-related Malice named Nakia () was introduced in \"Black Panther\" Vol. 3 #1 (November 1998) and was created by Christopher Priest and Mark Texeira.\n\nAs a child, Nakia of the Q'Noma Valley marsh tribe was picked by her tribal elders to be Wakandan Dora Milaje, \"Adored Ones\" or wives-in-training and spent three years training before being presented to King T'Challa; barely a teenager, she was instantly smitten with him, although he promised that her role was purely ceremonial. She became close friends with her fellow Dora Milaje, Okoye who, unlike her, took satisfaction with being just his bodyguard. Nakia's obsession with King T'Challa increased dramatically when Mephisto cast an illusion over T'Challa causing him to kiss Nakia. She consequently became jealous of T'Challa's American ex-girlfriend Monica Lynne and plotted to kill her, but T'Challa rescued her and banished Nakia bringing great shame on her tribe and Wakanda.\n\nNakia was captured by Achebe and tortured by him until Erik Killmonger came and freed her. Killmonger used the Altar of Resurrection on her and in the process gained enhanced abilities. Killmonger decided to name her Malice after the previous one. She went after T'Challa and his female allies and while battling Queen Divine Justice, killed one of T'Challa's allies, Nicole \"Nikki\" Adams.\n\nShe later teamed up with Man-Ape and kidnapped several of T'Challa's friends poisoning them out of revenge. Further, Nakia also planned on killing Monica and Dakota North, believing that the latter was also one of T'Challa's lovers. In the end, T'Challa foils the plan of Nakia, who manages to escape but not without giving him the antidote for his friends.\n\nNakia finally returned during a mission involving Everett K. Ross. When Ross is captured and tortured by the Hatut Zeraze (War Dogs), Nakia steps in to rescue him. Despite this, she is still in exile from the Dora Milaje. Embittered and cast out, Nakia developed an arsenal of weapons, including an herb named the jufeiro that gives her power over men. But longtime use of the drug made her grossly ill. In a desperate attempt to lure the Black Panther to her before she dies, Nakia tracked down a long forgotten Dora Milaje weapon called the Mimic-27 which can change and morph its shape and form as well as create ability-duplicating doppelgangers. She left Hydro-Man in charge of the A.I.M base where she nicked it from in case her hated sisterhood ever caught up with her.\n\nNakia eventually decided to send Mimic-27 after T'Challa's ex-wife, Ororo Monroe (aka Storm of the X-Men), but the weapon broke free of Nakia's control and attacked her, too. To stop it, the Dora Milaje needed Nakia's help, but she refused to act until she could see her king again. After meeting up with her beloved T'Challa, the Wakandan King requested she aid the Dora Milaje in stopping the now out of control doomsday weapon running amok in Harlem, Massachusetts. She and her former sisterhood would travel to an Astral Plane where the consciousness of said Living Vibranium weapon was housed. While the heroes of New York battled the rogue Mimic's self created doppelgängers, Nakia and the other Dora's battled its tainted sentience which had been poisoned by her own malignance. Nakia gained the strength of self to overcome her mirror reflection and finally quelled the mimic, but died in the process as it was also holding back the cancerous element ravaging her body. In honor for her sacrifice, she was taken back to Wakanda and given a proper burial with full honors by the Black Panther and his Adored Ones, Spider-Man, and the X-Men along with a cadre of Avengers.\n\nThe second villain to bear the name Malice first appeared in \"Ghost Rider\" #25 (August 1977). A showboater by nature, Malice made sure that his emergence was well televised. He burned a wax museum and left a woman to die as well as robbing a bank with his Vault Puller, one of the many devices he used to terrorize the police. While his secret identity is not known, there are suggestions that Malice is a wealthy individual, as he drives an AC Cobra and refers to hiding the money in the woods on his \"estate.\" He was arrested after being defeated by the Ghost Rider using an early predecessor to his penance stare.\n\nMalice was a negative aspect of The Invisible Woman's own personality, awakened by the manipulations of the villain Psycho-Man at a time when her emotions were easily susceptible. Sue became pregnant for a second time; however, this pregnancy was even more difficult than the first and Sue eventually lost the child, causing great emotional strain on her. Psycho-Man decided to take advantage of the situation and amplified her negative emotions which resulted in her transformation into Malice, The Mistress of Hate. Malice retained the powers of Susan, but she used them more aggressively, creating explosions and deadly force field spikes. During her first appearance, she was able to use her powers to withstand a direct punch from She-Hulk who was unaware of her identity at the time, and without flinching, She-Hulk did not realize she had just struck a force field. Reed and Johnny only learned who she really was thanks to Daredevil's heightened senses causing him to perceive her as an amorphous blob due to the force field around her. With this revelation, Reed was able to restore her to normal by provoking her into a genuine temper rather than the artificially-created hate she felt due to the Psycho-Man, disrupting the emotional balance that the Psycho-Man's equipment relied on to affect her. The episode would have lasting effects: the Invisible Girl changed her name to Invisible Woman; she discovered how to use force objects and she lost a measure of self-confidence, knowing that Malice still lurked inside her.\n\nDuring an adventure where Susan and Reed helped the Silver Surfer resuscitate Galactus, Sue came in contact with the Infinity Gems. Distrustful of such power, she fell prey to Malice again. The soul gem tried and failed to combine Reed and Sue's souls, which brought forth the In-Betweener and sent Malice back to Sue's subconscious.\n\nLater during the Infinity War when Adam Warlock's evil persona Magus attempted to conquer the universe, he used the alien species Anthropomorpho to create evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, Sue included. In order to subdue Susan the alien took the form of Malice, and Sue was only able to defeat the doppelganger by absorbing her into her own mind and incorporate its evil into herself. That boost allowed the negative aspect of Malice to regain control temporarily.\n\nEventually, the Invisible Woman's son Franklin Richards expelled Malice from her mind and into his own. Later Sue and Franklin joined their minds to force Malice out of Franklin and into the mind of the Dark Raider, an insane alternate universe counterpart of Mister Fantastic, however the Dark Raider managed to control and negate Malice's influence. Malice was apparently soon destroyed when the Dark Raider died shortly thereafter in the Negative Zone.\n\nThe Malice persona was briefly resurrected by the Psycho-Man when he collaborated with the mysterious Quiet Man who had been nurturing a grudge against the Fantastic Four for years. The Quiet Man had a crush on Sue before she met Reed but never had the nerve to talk to her. He hoped to use Malice's ruthlessness to make Susan act uncharacteristically violent in order to encourage judges in court to take her children away. However, Sue eventually overcame the worst of the programming, and the Psycho-Man subsequently removed Malice's influence when Sue threatened to use that anger against him.\n\nThe supervillain Malice was created by \"Uncanny X-Men\" writer Chris Claremont. She is a member of Mister Sinister's Marauders. Being incorporeal, she has no physical body of her own and has to possess the body of others. Those she possesses manifest a cameo-like choker around their neck. It is implied that the choker is a vessel for Malice's psychic energy form and destroying the choker can disperse her energy form for a short period of time. Malice body hops through a number of X-Men, including Dazzler, Wolverine, Rogue and Storm. Storm's will is too strong, and she forcibly ejects Malice from her body. After possessing Polaris, she singlehandedly defeats all her Marauders teammates, earning her a place as the field leader of the Marauders. A side effect occurs that Malice did not expect; Malice's and Polaris' energy matrices interweave and the two women become permanently bonded together. Mr. Sinister had known this union would occur, but did not warn Malice of it because he had wanted to use it to ensure Polaris would remain his prisoner/slave.\n\nAfter Mister Sinister is seemingly killed by Cyclops, Malice's hold over Polaris weakens. Polaris' alleged half-sister Zaladane, a priestess for the Savage Land's Sun People, uses the High Evolutionary's machinery to strip Polaris of her magnetic powers and take them as her own; the process also finally separates Polaris and Malice.\n\nMalice resurfaces years later to bother Polaris once more. She possesses Havok and tries to kill Polaris so she can get her revenge against Sinister, from whom she was trying to break free. In the end, Sinister asks Malice to possess Polaris once again, knowing that Lorna would not object to the possession in order to save Havok. However, out of their love for each other, Havok and Polaris each try to absorb Malice, preventing the other from being possessed. Malice is then apparently destroyed by Sinister himself. Later Scalphunter and Arclight explain to an imprisoned Threnody, a former ally of Mister Sinister who tried to escape him, that no one has ever escaped from Mister Sinister. They remind her about how Mister Sinister killed Malice.\n\nMalice later returns as a digital entity instead of a psionic one, taking possession of Karima Shapandar (Omega Sentinel) by a computer virus via e-mail. Emma Frost soon becomes aware of another being within Omega Sentinel but is nevertheless taken by surprise when Malice attacks and sedates her. The other X-Men continue to be unaware of Malice possessing Karima until they are attacked by her and the rest of the new Marauders. Later, she fights alongside the other Marauders in Flint, Michigan, against Iceman and Cannonball, as both sides try to obtain the Diaries of Destiny.\n\nIn \"\", Malice travels to Cooperstown, Alaska along with fellow Marauders Sunfire, Gambit, Prism, Blockbuster, Lady Mastermind, and Scalphunter. They try to find the baby but instead come across a small army of Purifiers and they come to blows, devastating the town. \n\nThe next time she is seen, the five member assault task force of X-Men invades the Marauders base, and is forced to fight Colossus along with Arclight, Frenzy, and Unuscione. She then teams up with Lady Mastermind in taking out Wolverine by throwing an unconscious Scrambler disguised as Angel at him. After he realizes the deception, she hits him with a powerful microwave energy blast. Nightcrawler teleports in and knocks her out along with Lady Mastermind.\n\nA squad consisting of Malice, Gambit, Sunfire, and Vertigo confront Bishop who is about to kill the baby. The Marauder team defeat Bishop and Malice seems to show a lot of affection towards the baby and finds it extraordinary that the baby girl isn't scared at all when she picks her up. \n\nDuring the final battle on Muir Island, Malice along with all of Sinister's army excluding Gambit and Mystique ambush X-Force. When X-Force is soon joined by the X-Men, Predator X, and the New X-Men, Cyclops allows the New X-Men to tackle the Marauders. Malice is skeptical when it comes to fighting children but is unpleasantly surprised with the tenacity of the youngsters. She goes on to battle Pixie, beating her with her bare fists, until Pixie fights back and guts Malice with her Souldagger. It appears that the dagger exorcises Malice from Omega Sentinel, but Karima has no memory of the events that took place in the last two and a half weeks, apparently a side effect of being possessed by Malice.\n\nMalice has since made her presence known in New York where she starts to possess people until Cyclops is able to detect her (possible with the help of Cerebra). While tracking her on a subway train he runs into a fight with the Superior Spider-Man. Malice possesses Cyclops for a few seconds before she is knocked unconscious by the Superior Spider-Man. He takes the possessed Cyclops to his lab and separates Malice from him, putting her in a containment box that he gives to Cyclops.\n\nIn the alternate reality depicted in \"What If?\", Vol. 2, #74 (June 1995), a version of Malice appears, possessing Madelyne Pryor (a clone of Jean Grey) as a member of Mister Sinister's X-Men. She appears in the form of a neck choker.\n\nIn the possible future that depicted \"\", the Malice choker was in possession of the renegade Sage. Obsessed with learning all things possible, she used Malice to datamine as many people as possible and then acquire the knowledge Malice gathered. Some of the X-Men were sent after Sage, but the hyper-intelligent mutant was ready for them and laid a trap. She managed to clip the choker around X-23's neck and Malice briefly possessed her, acquiring all the knowledge of the girl. Sage was caught soon after though and Malice was taken off her, putting a stop to her plans.\n\nIn the reality depicted in \"X-Men Forever\", Malice was used to take control over the alien Hepzibah. The Marauders were sent after the young Nate Grey and Hepzibah was used as a vessel to get close to the child. Lockheed figured out she was possessed and attacked her, alerting Polaris, who recognized Malice's trademark choker. Polaris ripped the choker off Hepzibah and left it lying on the ground, where it was picked up by Mystique.\n\nAn alternate version of Malice appeared in league with the New Marauders, a team displaced from their native universe (Earth-1610) and assembled by Miss Sinister; this version of Malice exists in the form of a necklace instead of a choker; it was in the possession of the time displaced version of Jean Grey and was abandoned when Grey and the rest of her team went to space to rescue Cyclops' father. When Polaris found the necklace, Malice was able to possessed her and used Polaris to attack the Raksha, a group of local vigilantes that were visiting the X-Mansion, but because Polaris had already fallen victim by the prime version of Malice, she was eventually able to snap out of her control and broke free which destroyed the necklace, and seemingly killing the entity in the process.\n\n\nLupita Nyong'o plays Nakia in the 2018 film \"Black Panther\". This version of Nakia does not fill a villainous role and is a former Dora Milaje who became a War Dog; an international spy for Wakanda. She was once in a relationship with T'Challa that seemed to end mutually, though it is clear that they still have feelings for each other. Nakia only returns to Wakanda upon hearing that T'Challa's father, T'Chaka, passed away. She stays after T'Challa is crowned king and asks that she accompany him to one of their missions, leading into the major events of the film.\n\nAfter Erik Killmonger seizes the throne and orders the heart-shaped herbs which grant the power of the Black Panther to be burned, Nakia steals one. Although Queen Mother Ramonda urges Nakia to consume it in order to challenge Killmonger, Nakia plans to offer it to M'Baku of the Mountain tribe so that he can challenge Killmonger with his army. M'Baku reveals that his people have recovered T'Challa, so Nakia gives the herb to him, healing him and restoring his powers as the Black Panther. Nakia then assists in the insurrection against Killmonger, dressing as a Dora Milaje soldier at Shuri's insistence. At the end of the film, Nakia agrees to resume her relationship with T'Challa and accepts a position running a Wakandan outreach center in California at the location of N'Jobu and Killmonger's former apartment.\n\nNakia appears in \"Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2\". She appears in the \"Black Panther\" DLC.\n\n"}
{"id": "1969461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969461", "title": "Odessa (Bee Gees album)", "text": "Odessa (Bee Gees album)\n\nOdessa is the sixth studio album by the Bee Gees, originally released on 30 March 1969. Regarded as the most significant of the group's Sixties albums, it was released as a double vinyl record, initially in an opulent red flocked cover with gold lettering. An ambitious project, originally intended as a concept album on the loss of a fictional ship in 1899, it created tension and disagreements in the band regarding the album's direction; finally, a dispute over which song to release as a single led to Robin Gibb temporarily leaving the group. The album was not well received by the public or the music press on release, and led to a decline in the group's fortunes until their disco period in the mid 1970s.\n\nReleased in March 1969 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US, it was the group's fourth album released internationally, their sixth overall, and their only double album of original music. \"Odessa\" would be the final album for the band's original incarnation, and this was the last album to include guitarist Vince Melouney. The album contains \"First of May\", \"Lamplight\", \"Marley Purt Drive\" and \"Melody Fair\".\n\nThe album was reissued as a single-disc in September 1976 when interest was revived in the Bee Gees career, since then the album has gained increasing critical acclaim; it was reissued again in January 2009 as a deluxe 3 disc set, and is included in \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nThe originally intended name for the album was \"An American Opera\". This later became \"Masterpeace\" and finally \"Odessa\".\n\nColin recalls about the country influence on \"Odessa\". \"It was my idea that we do that sort of thing, and Maurice is the one who will take more time out to listen to what I have to say, although within the group, the okay has to come from Barry\". Their manager Robert Stigwood says, \"Barry is the Bee Gees coordinator, I used the word advisedly, as there is no leader of the group as such. He has a tremendous feel for soul music a la his composing work for The Marbles, but he is also a fantastic solo singer in his own right\".\n\nThe first song recorded for the album was \"I Laugh in Your Face\" on 12 July 1968, the same day the group recorded \"I've Gotta Get a Message to You\" (released from the American version of the group's fifth album \"Idea\"). After recording eight songs for the album, guitarist Vince Melouney left the group amicably and joined the group Fanny Adams, wanting to pursue a more bluesy direction.\n\nA reel tape of mono mixes dated 24 November 1968 has \"Odessa (City on the Black Sea)\", \"First of May\" and \"Melody Fair\" called a \"rough mix with orchestra\". Therefore, about as soon as they returned to the studio, they were with Bill Shepherd arranging and conducting orchestral tracks to complete the album. This puts the re-make of \"First of May\" early in the November sessions, yet the song would be the last Bee Gees band session for the album. However, after recording \"First of May\", the instrumental tracks, \"Seven Seas Symphony\", \"With All Nations\" and \"The British Opera\" were recorded by Bill Shepherd. Also done somewhere around here are the final vocals for the New York songs and the added organ part for \"Edison\".\n\n\"Odessa\" was initially released on Polydor Records in the United Kingdom and Atco Records in the United States in a red flocked cover with a gold lettering to the group's name and label symbol stamped in gold on the front and nothing but the flocking on the back. The gatefold has a large dotted image of people leaving a ship in a lifeboat. There are no photographs of the group and they are not named except as to all songs being written by B, R & M Gibb. Due to the high cost of production, as well as allergic reactions among workers during assembly, this design was discontinued.\n\nPrior to release, there were disagreements over which song was to be released as a single, when the Robin-led \"Lamplight\" lost out to \"First of May,\" a Barry solo vocal. This ultimately led to Robin Gibb leaving the group in early 1969, though he would rejoin the group in August 1970. The split was a result of months of animosity, which concurred to the album's final mix. As Barry explained:\n\nThe last performances of the group including Robin were in early 1969, when they performed \"First of May\" (they also performed \"I Started a Joke\") on \"The Tom Jones Show\" (21 February) and \"Top of the Pops\" (6 March).\nRobin left the band on 15 March and made his decision public on 19 March. Robin told \"Mojo\" magazine in 2003 about his departure from the band after the release of \"Odessa\", saying \"We had egos\".\n\nMaurice later described the album as 'heavy'. \"People thought it was an in-depth album\", he recalled, \"like, 'What do they mean by those lyrics?' and 'What's this all about?' There's all sorts of different areas on it. It went up and down in places, but a lot of people regard it as our \"Sgt. Pepper\". To us, I don't think it was the best album we made, but the main title 'Odessa' I loved\". Barry responded to Maurice saying, \"I guess I have strong personal feelings about it because it was a time when the group was splitting up\".\n\nIn July 1969, \"Marley Purt Drive\" was released as a single, backed with \"Melody Fair\" only in South Africa.\n\nThe album was not well received by the public or the music press on release, and led to a decline in the band's fortunes until a quartet of hits: \"Lonely Days\", \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\", \"Run to Me\" and \"My World\". The album has since received positive critical attention, is regarded by many reviewers as their most significant Sixties release, and has been re-released in a deluxe three CD set.\n\nThe album was reissued in 1976 as an edited single-disc album with a plain red cover on RSO Records. The 1976 single LP reissue deleted tracks 3, 5, 7–9, 12, and 17. Some early CD and cassette editions also omitted the track \"With All Nations (International Anthem)\". On 13 January 2009, Reprise Records released a deluxe remaster of the album, as prepared by Rhino Records, with three discs containing, respectively, the album in stereo, the album in mono and selected rarities. The third disc, entitled \"Sketches for Odessa\" featured demos of the songs plus a vocal take of \"With All Nations (International Anthem)\" and the previously unissued tracks \"Nobody's Someone\" and \"Pity\". This edition restored the red flocking originally found on the LP.\n\nAll tracks written and composed by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb.\n\nOn 13 January 2009, Reprise Records released a 3-CD set of Odessa, complete with remastered stereo and mono version of all 17 tracks, plus a bonus third disc with demos, alternate version, and three unreleased tracks. To date, \"Odessa\" was the last album to receive the deluxe remaster treatment with extensive sleeve notes, and the status of the re-release program is unknown.\nDisc 1: stereo / Disc 2: mono\n\nDisc 3: \"Sketches for Odessa\" [all tracks previously unissued]\n\n"}

It is one of six extraocular muscles that control the movements of the eye. The lateral rectus muscle is responsible for lateral movement of the eyeball, specifically abduction. Abduction describes the movement of the eye away from the midline (i.a. nose), allowing the eyeball to move horizontally in the lateral direction, bringing the pupil away from the midline of the body.\n\nThe lateral rectus originates at the lateral part of the annulus of Zinn, also known as the annular tendon or common tendinous ring, and inserts into the temporal side of the eyeball. The annulus of Zinn is a tendinous ring that surrounds the optic nerve and serves as the origin for five of the six extraocular muscles, excluding the inferior oblique muscle.\n\nIt is the only muscle supplied by the abducens nerve, cranial nerve VI. The abducens nerve exits the brainstem from the pons-medullary junction, and travels through the superior orbital fissure to innervate the lateral rectus muscle.\n\nThe lateral rectus muscle is innervated through the tectospinal tract. This tract begins in the tectum region of the midbrain, and crosses to the contralateral side of the midbrain. The tectospinal tract descends through the brainstem to the upper spinal cord, but goes no further than the neck. This tract is involved with both upper and lower motor neurons, as well as in the reflex of turning the head in response to visual and auditory stimulus. Part of the descending tracts carry motor signals down the brainstem and spinal cord.\n\nIt causes outward movement of the eyeball, also called as abduction.\n\nA sixth nerve palsy, also known as abducens nerve palsy, is a neurological defect that results from a damaged or impaired abducens nerve. This damage can stem from stroke, trauma, tumor, inflammation, and infection. Damage to the abducens nerve by trauma can be caused by any type of trauma that causes elevated intracranial pressure; including hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury with intracranial bleeding, tumors, and lesions along the nerve at any point between the pons and lateral rectus muscle in orbit. This defect can result in horizontal double vision and reduced lateral movement. The lateral rectus muscle will be denervated and paralyzed and the patient will be unable to abduct the eye. For example, if the left abducens nerve is damaged, the left eye will not abduct fully. While attempting to look straight ahead, the left eye will be deviated medially towards the nose due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus of the eye. Proper function of the lateral rectus is tested clinically by asking the patient to look laterally. Depending on the underlying cause of the lateral rectus palsy, some improvement may occur naturally over time. While the prognosis for a lateral rectus palsy onset by a viral illness is generally positive, the prognosis for an onset of trauma or tumor is quite poor. Ultimately, nerves are not very good at regenerating or healing themselves, so if the damage is severe there will be permanent damage.\n\nIn addition, another disorder associated with the lateral rectus muscle is Duane Syndrome. This syndrome occurs when the sixth cranial nerve which controls the lateral rectus muscle does not develop properly. It is believed that Duane Syndrome is a result of a disturbance of normal embryonic development due to a genetic or an environmental factor.\n\n"}

The inferior oblique is an extraocular muscle, and is attached to the maxillary bone (origin) and the posterior, inferior, lateral surface of the eye (insertion). The inferior oblique is innervated by the inferior branch of the oculomotor nerve.\n\nThe inferior oblique arises from the orbital surface of the maxilla, lateral to the lacrimal groove. Unlike the other extraocular muscles (recti and superior oblique), the inferior oblique muscle does \"not\" originate from the common tendinous ring (annulus of Zinn).\n\nPassing lateralward, backward, and upward, between the inferior rectus and the floor of the orbit, and just underneath the lateral rectus muscle, the inferior oblique inserts onto the scleral surface between the inferior rectus and lateral rectus.\n\nIn humans, the muscle is about 35 mm long.\n\nThe inferior oblique is innervated by the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III).\n\nIts actions are extorsion, elevation and abduction of the eye.\n\nPrimary action is extorsion (external rotation); secondary action is elevation; tertiary action is abduction (i.e. it extorts the eye and moves it upward and outwards). The field of maximal inferior oblique elevation is in the adducted position.\n\nThe inferior oblique muscle is the only muscle that is capable of elevating the eye when it is in a fully adducted position.\n\nWhile commonly affected by palsies of the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve, isolated palsies of the inferior oblique (without affecting other functions of the oculomotor nerve) are quite rare.\n\n\"Overaction\" of the inferior oblique muscle is a commonly observed component of childhood strabismus, particularly infantile esotropia and exotropia. Because true hyperinnervation is not usually present, this phenomenon is better termed \"elevation in adduction\".\n\nSurgical procedures of the inferior oblique include: loosening (also known as recession see Strabismus surgery), myectomy, marginal myotomy, and denervation and extirpation. It is also encountered and identified in lower lid blepharoplasty surgeries.\n\n"}

After his death, he gained notoriety from allegations made by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison that he had been involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nHe was an avid anti-communist, alleged member of the Minutemen, the John Birch Society, Louisiana Committee on Un-American Activities, and alleged publisher of the \"Louisiana Intelligence Digest\". He also supported various anti-Castro groups in the New Orleans area: \"Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front\"; \"Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean\"; \"Friends of Democratic Cuba\". According to the \"New Orleans States-Item\" newspaper, \"Guy [Banister] participated in every anti-Communist South and Central American revolution that came along, acting as a key liaison man for the U.S. government-sponsored anti-Communist activities in Latin America.\"\n\nBanister was born in Monroe, Louisiana, the oldest of seven children. After studying at the Louisiana State University, he joined the Monroe Police Department.\n\nIn 1934, Banister joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was present at the killing of John Dillinger. Originally based in Indianapolis, he later moved to New York City where he was involved in the investigation of the American Communist Party. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was impressed by Banister's work and, in 1938, he was promoted to run the FBI unit in Butte, Montana. He also served in Oklahoma City, Minneapolis and Chicago. In Chicago, he was the Special Agent in Charge for the FBI. He retired from the FBI in 1954.\n\nBanister moved to Louisiana and, in January 1955, became Assistant Superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department, where he was given the task of investigating organized crime and corruption within the police force. It later emerged that he was also involved in looking at the role that left-wing political activists were playing in the struggle for civil rights in New Orleans. On the campuses of Tulane University and Louisiana State University, he ran a network of informants collecting information on \"communist\" activities. He submitted reports on his findings to the FBI through contacts.\n\nIn March 1957, Banister was suspended after pulling a gun in public in a bar and threatening a waiter. His suspension ended in June of that year. However, when he refused to be transferred to the N.O.P.D.'s Planning Department, he was dismissed from the force.\n\nAfter leaving the New Orleans Police Department, Banister established his own private detective agency, Guy Banister Associates, Inc. at 434 Balter Building. In June 1960, Banister moved his office to 531 Lafayette Street on the ground floor of the Newman Building. Around the corner but located in the same building, with a different entrance, was the address 544 Camp Street, which would later be found stamped on Fair Play for Cuba Committee leaflets distributed by Lee Harvey Oswald, the suspected assassin of President John F. Kennedy. The Newman Building housed militant anti-Castro groups, including the Cuban Revolutionary Council (October 1961 to February 1962), as well as Sergio Arcacha Smith's Crusade to Free Cuba Committee. Banister's office was within walking distance of the New Orleans offices of the FBI, CIA, Office of Naval Intelligence and the Reily Coffee Company (Lee Harvey Oswald's employer and a supporter of anti-Castro Cubans).\n\nBanister was implicated in a 1961 raid on a munitions depot in Houma, Louisiana, in which \"various weapons, grenades and ammunition were stolen ... which were reportedly seen stacked in Banister's back room by several witnesses.\" The \"New Orleans States-Item\" newspaper reported an allegation that Banister served as a munitions supplier for the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and continued to deal weapons from his office until 1963.\n\nIn 1962, Banister allegedly dispatched an associate, Maurice Brooks Gatlin — legal counsel of Banister's \"Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean\" — to Paris to deliver a suitcase containing $200,000 for the French OAS. In 1963, Banister and anti-Castro activist David Ferrie began working for a lawyer named G. Wray Gill and his client, New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello. This involved attempts to block Marcello's deportation to Guatemala.\n\nIn early 1962, Banister assisted David Ferrie in a dispute with Eastern Airlines regarding charges brought against Ferrie by the airline and New Orleans police of \"crimes against nature and extortion.\" During this period, Ferrie was frequently seen at Banister's office. Banister served as a character witness for Ferrie at his airline pilot's grievance board hearing in the summer of 1963.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 22, 1963, the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Banister and one of his investigators, Jack Martin, were drinking together at the Katzenjammer Bar, located next door to 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. On their return to Banister's office, the two men got into a dispute. Banister believed that Martin had stolen some files and drew his .357 Magnum revolver, striking Martin with it several times. During the altercation Martin yelled: \"What are you going to do — kill me like you all did Kennedy?\" Martin was badly injured and treated at Charity Hospital.\n\nOver the next few days, Martin told authorities and reporters that anti-Castro activist David Ferrie had been involved in the assassination. He claimed that Ferrie knew Oswald from their days in the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol, and that Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to use a rifle with a telescopic sight. Martin also claimed that Ferrie drove to Texas on the day of Kennedy's assassination, to serve as a getaway pilot for the assassins.\n\nWitnesses interviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations indicate Banister was \"aware of Oswald and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee before the assassination.\"\n\nBanister's secretary, Delphine Roberts, told author Anthony Summers that Oswald \"seemed to be on familiar terms with Banister and with [Banister's] office.\" Roberts said, \"As I understood it, he had the use of an office on the second floor, above the main office where we worked. Then, several times, Mr. Banister brought me upstairs, and in the office above I saw various writings stuck up on the wall pertaining to Cuba. There were various leaflets up there pertaining to Fair Play for Cuba.'\" The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated Roberts' claims and said that \"the reliability of her statements could not be determined.\"\n\nThe alleged activities of Banister, Ferrie and Oswald reached New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison who, by late 1966, had become very interested in the New Orleans aspects of the assassination. In December 1966, Garrison interviewed Martin about these activities. Martin claimed that Banister, Ferrie and a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles were involved in operations against Castro's Cuba that included gun running and burglarized armories.\n\nAs Garrison continued his investigation, he became convinced that a group of right-wing activists, including Banister, Ferrie and Clay Shaw, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to kill Kennedy. Garrison would later claim that the motive for the assassination was anger over Kennedy's attempts to obtain a peace settlement in both Cuba and Vietnam. Garrison also believed that Banister, Shaw, and Ferrie had conspired to set up Oswald as a patsy in the JFK assassination.\n\nBanister's publication, the \"Louisiana Intelligence Digest\", maintained that the civil rights movement was part of an international communist conspiracy and was treasonous.\n\nBanister died of coronary thrombosis on June 6, 1964. Banister's files went to various people after his death. Later, New Orleans Assistant District Attorney Andrew Sciambra interviewed Banister's widow. She told him that she saw some Fair Play for Cuba leaflets in Banister's office when she went there after his death.\n\nBanister also is a character in Oliver Stone's 1991 movie \"JFK\", in which he is portrayed by Edward Asner. He is also central to the plot of Don DeLillo's novel \"Libra\". Guy Banister appears as a character in James Ellroy's 1995 novel \"American Tabloid\" and its sequel \"The Cold Six Thousand\". In \"American Tabloid\", Banister organizes John Kennedy's assassination, which is based on Ward Littell's original plan. Littell is one of the story's main characters. In \"The Cold Six Thousand\", Guy Banister is murdered by Chuck Rogers under orders from Carlos Marcello.\n\n"}

Lawson\n\nMajor Ted William Lawson (March 7, 1917 – January 19, 1992) was an American officer in the United States Army Air Forces, who is known as the author of \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\", a memoir of his participation in the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in 1942. The book was subsequently adapted into the 1944 film of the same name starring Spencer Tracy, Van Johnson and Robert Mitchum.\n\nLawson was born in Alameda, California and attended Los Angeles City College in 1937-1938. He joined the U.S. Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet in March 1940 while a student studying aeronautical engineering by day and working nights in the drafting department of Douglas Aircraft Company. After basic flight instruction at Hancock Field, Santa Maria, California, Lawson attended primary flying training at Randolph Field and advanced training at Kelly Field, receiving his pilot's wings and commission as a Second Lieutenant on 15 November 1940.\n\nLawson was assigned to the 95th Bomb Squadron, 17th Bomb Group (Medium) at McChord Field, Washington. He was assigned as a co-pilot flying B-18 Bolo medium bombers and checked out in the Douglas B-23 Dragon. He became a first pilot in February 1941 and two months later the group received seven B-25 Mitchells, the first of the new medium bombers to be assigned to a unit in the Air Corps.\n\nWhile his squadron was based at McChord, Lawson married Ellen Arlene Reynolds, a librarian at LACC he had met while a student, in Spokane on 5 September 1941. His best man at the ceremony was squadron-mate Lt. Robert M. Gray, who would be a fellow pilot on the Doolittle Raid.\n\nIn early 1942, Lawson, then a First Lieutenant, was flying antisubmarine patrols with the 17th BG out of Pendleton, Oregon. As the first Army Air Corps group to receive the B-25 Mitchell, the 17th BG had the most experienced pilots and so was ordered from Oregon to Lexington County Army Air Base at Columbia, South Carolina, ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the East Coast of the United States but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\" but unspecified mission. On 17 February the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force.\n\nLieutenant Lawson was accepted as a volunteer for the mission led by then-Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle to bomb Tokyo and several other cities with 16 carrier-launched B-25 Mitchell bombers from aboard the USS Hornet (CV-8) - the first air raid on mainland Japan during World War II following the Pearl Harbor attack. \nThe aircraft that he flew on the raid was nicknamed \"The Ruptured Duck\" (AAF serial \"40-2261\"). According to Lawson in his book, the plane's unusual name evolved from a minor training accident where the aircraft tail scraped the ground on take-off. Soon after Lawson found someone had written \"ruptured duck\" in chalk on the fuselage. Inspired, he had B-25 gunner Cpl. Rodger Lovelace create the now-famous caricature of Donald Duck with crutches and pilot's headphones.\n\nAfter launching the mission 170 miles (275 km) further out than planned and bombing their targets in Japan, all of the aircraft ran out of fuel short of their intended recovery airfields in non-Japanese occupied China. Lawson and his crew crashed their plane off the coast of the small island of Nantien when its engines failed while trying to land on the beach during a storm. Lawson and his co-pilot were both thrown through the windscreen of the B-25, with Lawson suffering a compound fracture of the left leg, a lacerated left bicep, and severe facial injuries in the process.\n\nAll five crew members survived the crash; however all but flight engineer/gunner David J. Thatcher received serious injuries. Bombardier Robert Clever would be returned to the U.S., only to die in another plane crash in November, 1942. After he was transported by friendly Chinese throughout several provinces in China to evade Japanese troops searching for his crew, Lawson's infected leg was amputated by the mission's flight surgeon, Lt Thomas R. White, who had volunteered to fly the mission as a gunner on the crew of Lt. Donald Smith. The nose art of the crashed bomber, \"The Ruptured Duck\", was later salvaged by the Japanese and put on display in Tokyo.\n\nIn January 1943, Lawson and newspaper columnist Bob Considine decided to write a book about the mission, entitled \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\". In four nights and two days in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., the entire story was worked out, although approval to publish the book was not given until after information about the raid was released by the War Department in April 1943.\n\n\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" first appeared serialized in six issues of \"Collier's\" magazine, from May 22 to June 26, 1943. It was also published later that year by Random House in a 220-page hardback \"wartime book\" (5 1/4\" x 7 3/4\") format.\n\nThrough friends in the Los Angeles area, Ted made contact with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer producer Sam Zimbalist, and the movie was launched in 1944. The film starred Van Johnson as Lawson, alongside Spencer Tracy and Robert Mitchum. It won an Academy Award for Best Special Effects. \nIn 2003, Brassey's reprinted \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" with more photos and an introduction from Lawson's widow, Ellen.\n\nAlong with the majority of the surviving Doolittle Raiders, Lawson was eventually repatriated back to the United States, and in his case, for further medical care including a second amputation of his injured leg and reconstruction of his lower face. During his recuperation, Lawson was promoted to captain in accordance with Doolittle's recommendation that all the raiders be promoted one grade, and later to major. He served as Liaison Officer, U.S. Air Mission, Santiago, Chile from May 1943 until April 1944. He was retired from the U.S. Army Air Forces for physical disability on February 2, 1945. His decorations include the Distinguished Flying Cross, Purple Heart, and the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Corps Medal, Class A, 1st Grade.\n\nAfter the war, Lawson owned and operated a machine shop in Southern California, and also worked for Reynolds Metals as a liaison between the company and the military. He died at his home in Chico, California on January 19, 1992 and was interred at the Chico Cemetery Mausoleum.\n\nLawson Army Airfield at Fort Benning, Georgia is partially named for Ted W. Lawson. It was originally named only for Walter R. Lawson (no relation to Ted), an Army Air Corps flyer who earned the Distinguished Service Cross in World War I. Several years later, after the Doolittle Raid in World War II, Ted W. Lawson's name was added to the memorial at the field.\n\nThe Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor, located on Ford Island, has on display a B-25 done in the livery of Lawson's aircraft from the Doolittle Raid.\n\n\n\n"}

It is considered to be his signature song and is his most successful single.\n\nAlong with Hammer, Rick James shares songwriting credits with Alonzo Miller because the song samples the prominent opening riff of \"Super Freak\". It has been used or referenced in television shows, films, commercials and other forms of media. It has also received awards and recognitions.\n\nThe song is notable as the winner of the Best R&B Song and a Best Rap Solo Performance and the first rap song to be nominated for Record of the Year at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1991 as well as the Best Rap Video and Best Dance Video at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. It peaked at No. 1 in the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and on the charts in several countries.\n\nThe song samples the prominent opening riff of the Rick James song \"Super Freak\", which is repeated throughout the recording. The lyrics describe Hammer as having \"toured around the world, from London to the Bay\" and as being \"magic on the mic\", which he says coincides with James' \"beat that you can't touch\". Additionally, the lyrics \"You can't touch this\" and \"Stop! Hammer time!\" became pop culture catchphrases. \"Hammertime\" was later used as the title of a reality show starring Hammer on the A&E Network in the summer of 2009.\n\nThe sample of \"Super Freak\" that forms the basis of the song led Rick James and other performers on the original record to file a lawsuit for infringement of copyright. The suit was settled out of court when Hammer agreed to credit James as a songwriter, effectively granting him millions of dollars in royalties.\n\nThe song was first performed publicly on a late 1989 episode of \"The Arsenio Hall Show.\"\n\nBecause the song was not initially released as a single, listeners had to purchase the album, which as a result, went on to sell more than 18 million copies, gaining multi-platinum certifications from the RIAA, as well as in other countries.\n\nDirected by Rupert Wainwright, a music video was produced to promote the single, showing Hammer doing some of his signature dances, such as \"The Running Man\" and the \"Hammer Dance\".\n\nIn April 1990 the song hit the Top 40. It also secured a Best R&B Song and a Best Rap Solo Performance in 1991, a new category at the time and the first rap song to be nominated for Record of the Year. The single was a major success, reaching #1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and no. 8 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The track also performed successfully in other parts of the world, peaking at no. 1 in Australia, Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden, and no. 3 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn September 1990, the music video for the song won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video and Best Dance Video and was nominated for Best Male Video, Best Editing, and Best Choreography. In 1991, \"Kids Incorporated\" covered the song in the Season 7 episode \"Pipe Dreams\".\n\nIn 1999, MTV's \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\" included the song at No. 71. In October 2000, VH1's \"\"100 Greatest Dance Songs\"\" included it at No. 88. In May 2001, VH1's \"100 Greatest Videos\" included it at No. 59.\n\nIn August 2005, the song was certified gold. In December 2007, VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\" included it at No. 16. During 2008, it ranked as No. 26 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop\".\n\nThe song is used comically in various films of the 2000s and 2010s such as \"Bubble Boy\", \"\", \"The Master of Disguise\", \"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\", \"Shark Tale\", \"White Chicks\", \"Racing Stripes\", \"\" and \"\", among others.\n\nIn 1991, a parody entitled \"I Can't Watch This\" was released by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic for his album \"Off the Deep End\", with lyrics complaining about bad TV shows overlaid on the song's music track and featuring samples of various commercials during the breakdowns. A groove metal cover of the song was performed by the Austrian NDH band Stahlhammer, infused with death growls and heavy guitar riffs.\n\nBefore the NFL season started, the Miami Dolphins parodied the song as \"U Can't Touch Us\".\n\n\n"}

The original design started in 1919 but lapsed until resurrected in 1927 as a partner-piece for a new 155 mm gun. It was standardized as 8 inch Howitzer M1 in 1940. The M115/M1 was towed by the M35 Prime Mover gun tractor or a Mack 7⅓ ton 6×6 truck. The M115 was towed with 21 men per gun, and was shipped over to Germany Oct 1961 in response to the Berlin Crisis.\n\nLike the British BL 8 inch Howitzer of the First World War (and most other large artillery), the M115 uses a Welin screw for its breech. The carriage was the same as used for the US 155 mm gun and was also adopted by the British for their 7.2 inch howitzer. It consists of equilibrator assemblies, elevating and traversing mechanisms, two single-wheel, single-axle heavy limber, and a two-axle bogie with eight tires and two trails. Four spades, carried on the trails, are used to emplace the weapon. The British 8 inch howitzer was produced in England and under license in the US, for the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War I, as the 8-inch Howitzer MK. VI. It was in service with the US Army till replaced by the M115. There are no reports of the MK. VI or another marks being used during World War II.\n\nThe first photos of the M115 type 8 inch cannon on its redesign carriage appeared in 1931 but development was slowed by the Great Depression.\n\nThe M115 saw U.S. service in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In the late 1950s, it was adopted in small numbers by several NATO armies, to fire the W33 (M422/M422A1 shell) and later the W79 nuclear artillery shell, under the NATO nuclear sharing concept, a role which ended when the smallest types of tactical nuclear weapons were removed from service and eliminated. It was also adopted as a field weapon by a number of nations in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and saw service in the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis and the Croatian War of Independence.\n\n\n\nThe howitzer fired separate loading, bagged charge ammunition, with seven different propelling charges, from 1 (the smallest) to 7 (the largest).\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1930 to 1955, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell.\n\nThe son of Frank Albert Schultz and Margaret MacPhail, Schultz was educated at Wesley College and the University of Manitoba. He was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1920 and worked as a barrister, beginning his own practice at Baldur in 1921. He was a member of the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, and was appointed a King's Counsel.\n\nSchultz served on the Baldur school board and the Baldur town board from 1922 to 1936. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on January 29, 1930, in the rural constituency of Mountain. The circumstances of Schultz's election were significant for the emerging alliance of Liberals and Progressives in the Manitoba legislature. Schultz, a Liberal, won by acclamation when the Progressives declined to nominate a candidate. The parties created a formal alliance in the legislature two years later, and eventually became known simply as \"Liberal-Progressives\".\n\nSchultz easily defeated a Conservative opponent in the 1932 election, and a Social Credit opponent in the 1936 election. He was appointed to cabinet on September 21, 1936 as Minister of Education in John Bracken's government.\n\nReturned by acclamation in the 1941 provincial election, Schultz was transferred to the Ministry of Health on February 5, 1944, by Stuart Garson, who had succeeded Bracken as Premier of Manitoba one year earlier. Schultz easily defeated a candidate of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in the 1945 election, and was returned by acclamation again in 1949.\n\nAfter another cabinet shuffle on November 7, 1952, Schultz was named as Attorney General of Manitoba. He was easily re-elected in the 1953 election, and stepped down from cabinet and the legislature on January 22, 1955 when he was appointed as a judge in the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba.\n\nSchultz was one of the most important figures in the legislature during the 1940s and 1950s. Like most others in the Liberal-Progressive Party, he was essentially conservative in his political views and reluctant to legislate progressive changes. He opposed increases in Mothers' Allowances in the 1940s, and opposed penal reform even prior to his appointment as Attorney General.\n"}
{"id": "1969542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969542", "title": "Extraocular muscles", "text": "Extraocular muscles\n\nThe extraocular muscles are the six muscles that control movement of the eye and one muscle that controls eyelid elevation (levator palpebrae). The actions of the six muscles responsible for eye movement depend on the position of the eye at the time of muscle contraction.\n\nSince only a small part of the eye called the fovea provides sharp vision, the eye must move to follow a target. Eye movements must be precise and fast. This is seen in scenarios like reading, where the reader must shift gaze constantly. Although under voluntary control, most eye movement is accomplished without conscious effort. Precisely how the integration between voluntary and involuntary control of the eye occurs is a subject of continuing research. It is known, however, that the vestibulo-ocular reflex plays an important role in the involuntary movement of the eye.\n\nFour of the extraocular muscles have their origin in the back of the orbit in a fibrous ring called the annulus of Zinn: the four rectus muscles. The four rectus muscles attach directly to the front half of the eye (anterior to the eye's equator), and are named after their straight paths. Note that medial and lateral are relative terms. Medial indicates near the midline, and lateral describes a position away from the midline. Thus, the medial rectus is the muscle closest to the nose. The superior and inferior recti do not pull straight back on the eye, because both muscles also pull slightly medially. This posterior medial angle causes the eye to roll with contraction of either the superior rectus or inferior rectus muscles. The extent of rolling in the recti is less than the oblique, and opposite from it.\n\nThe \"superior oblique\" muscle originates at the back of the orbit (a little closer to the medial rectus, though medial to it), getting rounder as it courses forward to a rigid, cartilaginous pulley, called the trochlea, on the upper, nasal wall of the orbit. The muscle becomes tendinous about 10mm before it passes through the pulley, turning sharply across the orbit, and inserts on the lateral, posterior part of the globe. Thus, the superior oblique travels posteriorly for the last part of its path, going over the top of the eye. Due to its unique path, the superior oblique, when activated, pulls the eye downward and laterally.\n\nThe last muscle is the \"inferior oblique\", which originates at the lower front of the nasal orbital wall, and passes under the LR to insert on the lateral, posterior part of the globe. Thus, the inferior oblique pulls the eye upward and laterally.\n\nThe movements of the extraocular muscles take place under the influence of a system of extraocular muscle pulleys, soft tissue pulleys in the orbit. The extraocular muscle pulley system is fundamental to the movement of the eye muscles, in particular also to ensure conformity to Listing's law. Certain diseases of the pulleys (heterotopy, instability, and hindrance of the pulleys) cause particular patterns of incomitant strabismus. Defective pulley functions can be improved by surgical interventions.\n\nThe extraocular muscles are supplied mainly by branches of the ophthalmic artery. This is done either directly or indirectly, as in the lateral rectus muscle, via the lacrimal artery, a main branch of the ophthalmic artery. Additional branches of the ophthalmic artery include the ciliary arteries, which branch into the anterior ciliary arteries. Each rectus muscle receives blood from two anterior ciliary arteries, except for the lateral rectus muscle, which receives blood from only one. The exact number and arrangement of these cilary arteries may vary. Branches of the infraorbital artery supply the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles.\n\nThe nuclei or bodies of these nerves are found in the brain stem. The nuclei of the abducens and oculomotor nerves are connected. This is important in coordinating the motion of the lateral rectus in one eye and the medial action on the other. In one eye, in two antagonistic muscles, like the lateral and medial recti, contraction of one leads to inhibition of the other. Muscles show small degrees of activity even when resting, keeping the muscles taut. This \"tonic\" activity is brought on by discharges of the motor nerve to the muscle.\n\nThe extraocular muscles develop along with Tenon's capsule (part of the ligaments) and the fatty tissue of the eye socket (orbit). There are three centers of growth that are important in the development of the eye, and each is associated with a nerve. Hence the subsequent nerve supply (innervation) of the eye muscles is from three cranial nerves. The development of the extraocular muscles is dependent on the normal development of the eye socket, while the formation of the ligament is fully independent.\n\nBelow is a table of each of the extraocular muscles and their innervation, origins and insertions, and the primary actions of the muscles (the secondary and tertiary actions are also included, where applicable).\n\nIntermediate directions are controlled by simultaneous actions of multiple muscles. When one shifts the gaze horizontally, one eye will move laterally (toward the side) and the other will move medially (toward the midline). This may be neurally coordinated by the central nervous system, to make the eyes move together and almost involuntarily. This is a key factor in the study of strabismus, namely, the inability of the eyes to be directed to one point.\n\nThere are two main kinds of movement: conjugate movement (the eyes move in the same direction) and disjunctive (opposite directions). The former is typical when shifting gaze right or left, the latter is convergence of the two eyes on a near object. Disjunction can be performed voluntarily, but is usually triggered by the nearness of the target object. A \"see-saw\" movement, namely, one eye looking up and the other down, is possible, but not voluntarily; this effect is brought on by putting a prism in front of one eye, so the relevant image is apparently displaced. To avoid double vision from non-corresponding points, the eye with the prism must move up or down, following the image passing through the prism. Likewise conjugate torsion (rolling) on the anteroposterior axis (from the front to the back) can occur naturally, such as when one tips one's head to one shoulder; the torsion, in the opposite direction, keeps the image vertical.\n\nThe muscles show little inertia - a shutdown of one muscle is not due to checking of the antagonist, so the motion is not ballistic.\n\nThe initial clinical examination of the extraoccular eye muscles is done by examining the movement of the globe of the eye through the \"six cardinal eye movements\". When the eye is turned out (temporally) and horizontally, the function of the lateral rectus muscle is tested. When the eye is turned in (nasally) and horizontally, the function of the medial rectus muscle is being tested. When turning the eye down and in, the inferior rectus is contracting. When turning it up and in the superior rectus is contracting. Paradoxically, turning the eye up and out uses the inferior oblique muscle, and turning it down and out uses the superior oblique. All of these six movements can be tested by drawing a large \"H\" in the air with a finger or other object in front of a patient's face and having them follow the tip of the finger or object with their eyes without moving their head. Having them focus on the object as it is moved in toward their face in the midline will test \"convergence\", or the eyes' ability to turn inward simultaneously to focus on a near object.\n\nTo evaluate for weakness or imbalance of the muscles, a penlight is shone directly on the corneas. Expected normal results of the corneal light reflex is when the penlight's reflection is located in the centre of both corneas, equally.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1969546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1969546", "title": "Green National Convention", "text": "Green National Convention\n\nThe Green National Convention is the Presidential nominating convention of the Green Party of the United States (GPUS). Though the Green National Committee meets annually in a \"national meeting\", the convention is convened by the GNC once every four years in order to nominate an official candidate in the upcoming U.S. Presidential election, and to officially adopt the party platform and rules for the election cycle.\n\nThe convention signals the end of the primary season for Greens, and the start of campaigning for the general election of that year; as such, prominent Greens in state and local races are also spotlighted in order to give them the publicity that the convention affords. In contrast to the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, however, the convention is not merely a formality which endorses the will of the electorate in the primaries, but the final determinant for the nomination. This is because ballot access laws in many states prohibit the Green Party from holding a state-sponsored primary election—only five states were able to meet the requirements in 2004—and others prevent voters from actually registering into the party, thus making it difficult to credential Greens.\n\nAs such, Green conventions often have a degree of contentiousness which was seen only in past conventions of the Democratic and Republican Parties, prior to reforms in 1968 and 1972, respectively.\n\nThe leadership of the first nationwide Green organization in the United States, The Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA), were generally opposed to an entry into electoral politics. Thus, the G/GPUSA's national meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1995 ended with a resolution not to nominate a candidate for the 1996 election. However, a group of Greens interested in a run by consumer advocate Ralph Nader met in Los Angeles in 1996 to nominate Nader for President and Winona LaDuke for Vice-President. Arguably, though it lacked official sanction, this was the first nominating convention of the Green Party in the United States, and the only one with which the G/GPUSA, if only certain members, was at all involved.\n\nFollowing the general election in 1996, several state Green Parties formed the Association of State Green Parties (ASGP). As such, they met in Denver, Colorado in 2000 to once again nominate Nader and LaDuke.\n\nIn 2001, the ASGP formally adopted the name \"Green Party of the United States\", and was recognized by the Federal Election Commission as the official National Committee of the Green Party. The first convention under that name, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 2004, was not without controversy. Nader decided to forgo the Green nomination in favor of asking for an \"endorsement\" of his independent candidacy; the Greens instead nominated David Cobb for President on the second ballot from among a number of candidates, many of whom were \"favorite sons\", running as placeholders for Nader. Pat LaMarche was named the Vice-Presidential candidate.\n\nThe following is a list of United States Green Party Presidential nominating conventions.\n\nIn addition to the presidential nominating convention, there is a national meeting in all other years for the party. During the era of the Association of State Green Parties, separate annual meetings were held in the same year of presidential conventions. Since 2004, the presidential convention has consolidated annual meetings during presidential election years. \n\n"}
