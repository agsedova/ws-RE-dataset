The name is taken from the successive castles and palaces located on the island since Bishop Absalon constructed the city's first castle on the island in 1167 at the site where Christiansborg Palace lies today.\n\nRecognised as the centre of the Government of Denmark since the Middle Ages, the island is sometimes referred to as 'the Island of Power', and is lined with central government institutions and ministries; the name \"Slotsholmen\" is thus also frequently used as a metonym for overall Danish governmental administration.\n\nThe island is dominated by the vast Christiansborg Palace which houses the Danish Parliament, the Supreme Court of Denmark, the Prime Minister's Office and the State Rooms of the Queen. Also located on the island are the most important ministries, the Danish National Archives, the Royal Danish Library, several museums and the historic buildings of the Christian IV's Stock Exchange, the Chancellery and Christian IV's Brewhouse.\n\nThe population number was 18 people as of 1 January 2020.\n\nThe site used to consist of several small natural islands in the sound between the islands of Zealand and Amager. On the largest of these, Strandholmen (English: Beach Islet), Bishop Absalon of Roskilde constructed a small castle in 1167. In 1250 the castle was extended with two side towers to get the appearance that is now depicted on Copenhagen's Coat of Arms. The castle was conquered by the Hanseatic League 1368 and pulled down the following year as part of peace terms. Shortly after Copenhagen Castle was built on the same site and it became the residence for the Danish king in 1443.\n\nAfter the 1535-36 siege of Copenhagen during the Count's Feud, it became clear that the castle was outdated as a military installation, and King Christian III transformed the castle from a military stronghold to a more liveable royal residence. However, the reconstruction took place in a rather haphazard way and continued during the reign of the following kings, resulting in a rather irregular appearance of the castle.\n\nAt the same time, it became clear that the castle was becoming too small to hold the functions necessary in order to function as a royal residence and seat of the administration so a series of smaller buildings began to be erected on Slotsholmen. Probably during the reign of Christian III a building was constructed on the quay of the canal in front of the castle to house the Chancellery. During the reign of Christian III and Frederick II an arsenal was constructed by the beach south of the castle, and during the reign of Frederick II probably also a supply depot.\nUnder King Christian IV Slotsholmen saw considerable development, especially in the southern part of the island. Here a new naval harbour was established, surrounded on one side by an Arsenal and on the other side by a Supply Depot. Other new buildings constructed were the Stock Exchange and the Brewhouse. All four of these historic buildings are still there today.\n\nBy the time of the introduction of the absolute monarchy in 1660, the role of Slotsholmen as the centre of administration was firmly established.\n\nDuring the reign of King Frederick III, further lack of space in the castle led to the construction in 1665-1673 of an additional building between the Supply Depot and the Arsenal. This building, also still visible today, was to house the Cabinet of curiosities of the king, founded about 1650, and the Royal Library, founded in 1648.\nDuring the reign of King Frederick IV, a magnificent administration building was constructed in 1716-21 next to the palace adjacent to the Supply Depot. This new building was to house the chancelleries, thus replacing the previous chancellery building situated by the canal. The new chancellery building was connected to the castle by an arched passageway, thus allowing the king to stay in close contact with his government. The Chancellery Building (also known as the \"Red Building\" or the \"Building of Colleges\") has functioned as the heart of the central administration for almost 300 years, and is today used by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nIn spite of many attempts and projects to replace the small and antiquated castle with a more up-to-date royal residence fit for an absolute king, the old castle continued to exist well into the 18th century. Several renovations were made, most notably by Frederick IV in 1721-29. This rebuilding thoroughly changed the irregular appearance of the castle to a more regular shape.\n\nHowever, just two years after the rebuilding was completed, the Copenhagen Castle was demolished in 1731 to give room for three consecutive Christiansborg Palaces, the two first of which were destroyed by fires (in 1794 and 1884). Parts of the first and second Christianborg Palace still remain and is integrated in the present palace. The ruins of Absalon's Castle and the Copenhagen Castle are excavated and at display today under the present Christiansborg.\n\nSlotsholmen is surrounded partly by Copenhagen Inner Harbour, partly by canals. Nine bridges connect Slotsholmen to the rest of Copenhagen, both Zealand-side and Amager-side.\n\nKnippelsbro is a bascule bridge and one of several bridges over Copenhagen's Inner Harbour; others being Langebro, Lille langebro, Bryggebroen and Copenhagen's Inner Harbour Bridge. It connects Slotsholmen to Christianshavn by extending Børsgade to Torvegade.\n\nMarmorbroen (English: The Marble Bridge) connects Christiansborg Riding Ground Complex to Ny Vestergade that continues to Dantes Plads with the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. The bridge was constructed from 1739-45. It has a sandstone cladding with medallion ornamentation on the sides while to top is covered with marble.\n\nStormbroen (English: The Assault Bridge) is a small arch bridge in stone, connecting Stormgade (towards The City Hall Square) with Vindebrogade on Slotsholmen.\n\nThe bridge is named after the Assault on Copenhagen in 1659. It was at this very spot, where the city ramparts at that time was located, that the Swedish troops made their principal attack. After a series of defeats, the Danish troops finally gained victory, the Swedish troops leaving 2,000 dead soldiers in front of the ramparts at Stormgade.\n\nVarious sources state that the bridge was erected in 1681 but on the side the inscription \"erected in MDCLX is carved into its stone foundation. The bridge was renovated by Martin Nyrop in 1918.\n\nHøjbro (English: High Bridge) is an arch bridge in wrought iron, connecting Højbro Square with Slotsholmen. It is designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup and was built in 1878. Holmens Bro and Børsbroen also used to be the work of Dahlerup but these gave both been replaced.\n\nThe current bridge is not high at all. The name goes back to the wooden bascule bridge that was the first bridge to Slotsholmen.\n\nHolmens Bro is an arch bridge built in granite in 1954 to replace Dahlerup's design from 1878.\n\nSince efforts to improve water quality in Copenhagen Harbour has made the water clean enough to allow swimming, an open-water swimming competition around Slotsholmen has been revitalized.\nWith the course being 2,000 metres, the 10,000 metre race involves five loops. There is both a competition for amateurs who swim in the afternoon and a FINA Marathon Swimming World Cup event with US$11,000 in prize money that takes place in the morning. The swim takes place in August and water temperatures are 18-22 °C.\n\nThe nature of the course makes it unusually good for spectators and that combined with the historical surroundings have gained it a reputation as one of the best open water swim competitions in Europe.\n\n"}

It formed part of the City of Victoria. West Point, a former cape where major government structures in Sai Wan are close to, also used to refer to Sai Wan. After Hong Kong's handover to People's republic of China, Sai Wan become the location for Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and people in Hong Kong tend to refer the name Sai Wan as the PRC office itself. .\n\nIn the early 1800s, Sai Ying Pun was known as a place to settle the Chinese immigrants. It was built from the west of Tai Ping Shan. Europeans were also assigned to live in the same area. However, they were separated at the High Street where Chinese were excluded from living.\n\nIn 1880, sewerage was installed into the area, with the main flow coming down Centre Street. Streets were covered with macadam and concreted at the same time.\n\nIn 1890s, a severe epidemic outbreak of the bubonic plague afflicted Sai Ying Pun residents. Sheung Fung Lane residents were almost wiped out during the period. Government Reports identified this area as the no. IX health district and went into great detail about the buildings where the disease occurred. The neighboring area, Tai Ping Shan, was the most infected place in the city. It was resumed, abandoned and demolished to improve hygiene.\n\nThe name of Shek Tong Tsui derived from a famous ancient stone pond, \"Shek Tong\" (石塘) in Cantonese, inside the area. The stone pond was located at modern-day Hill Road and The Belcher's, and was mined by the Hakka people since the 17th century.\n\nIn 1903, the first land reclamation of Shek Tong Tsui was finished. In the meantime, the largest brothels in the city, which were located at the Possession Street, were destroyed by a big fire. Consequently, Hong Kong Governor Matthew Nathan decided to move all Hong Kong Island's brothels to Shek Tong Tsui in the early 1900s due to the large area recently claimed from the land reclamation. The place was then being well flourished as a red light district and came to its golden period. Numerous Cantonese opera theaters and restaurants were founded because of the business of brothels. It was the best place to entertain the affluent Chinese in Hong Kong.\n\nQueen's Road was the first road built in Hong Kong, constructed by the British from 1841 to 1843. It connected the Victoria City from Shek Tong Tsui to Wan Chai.\n\nBrothels in this area had also inspired numerous novels and Hong Kong films, most notably \"Rouge\" (1987), starring Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung.\n\nBelcher Bay was named after Edward Belcher who landed on Possession Point at the north shore of Hong Kong Island and made the first British survey of Hong Kong Harbour on 25 January 1841.\n\nBelcher Bay, Gin Drinkers Bay and Tseung Kwan O were known as the 'Bay of Trash' in Hong Kong.\n\nBelcher's Street is the main street in Kennedy Town of Hong Kong. It connects Victoria Road and Queen's Road West. A small section in its west end built a turn around for Hong Kong Tramway.\n\nIt is currently used as a site for ships to load and unload goods.\n\nKennedy Town was the western section of the historical Victoria City. It was named after the governor Arthur Edward Kennedy who initiated land reclamation along the coast of this area in 1886. It formed a narrow coastal strip of land that included the Kennedy Praya and the coastal area from Beach Street via Collinson Street to Shek Tong Tsui.\n\nIn 1903, the Hong Kong Government erected seven boundary stones for the city, inscribed \"City Boundary 1903\". One of them is located at the Kennedy Town Temporary Recreation Ground at Sai Ning Street (西寧街).\n\nFrom 1933 to 1939, more land was reclaimed along the coast of Kennedy Town, yet the construction was suspended due to the Battle of Hong Kong in 1941. Another land reclamation was conducted recently at the end of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}

This was the northernmost point on the western half of Hong Kong Island.\n\nThe Hong Kong Government divided Victoria City into four \"wan\" (環), or districts. While West Point falls into Sai Wan, or Western District, major government structures like the police station and court (Western Magistracy) are located near West Point. Thus the name of Sai Wan, Western District, Western and West Point were sometimes used interchangeably.\n\nSt. Stephen’s Anglican Church located in West Point was founded by the Church Missionary Society (Church Mission Society)(CMS) in 1865.

{"id": "2019502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019502", "title": "Quoits", "text": "Quoits\n\nQuoits ( or ) is a traditional game which involves the throwing of metal, rope or rubber rings over a set distance, usually to land over or near a spike (sometimes called a hob, mott or pin). The sport of quoits encompasses several distinct variations.\n\nIt is not until the 19th century that the game is documented in any detailed way. The official rules first appeared in the April 1881 edition of \"The Field\", having been defined by a body formed from pubs in Northern England.\n\nA July 13, 1836 advertisement in the \"National Intelligencer\" (Washington, D.C.) touted facilities for \"the manly and healthy amusements of quoits, ten-pin, fives, &c.\" on the premises of a \"Coffee House\" in Berkeley Springs, Virginia (now West Virginia).\n\nA game played with metal discs, traditionally made of steel, and thrown across a set distance at a metal spike (called a pin, hob or mott). The spike is centrally, and vertically, positioned in a square of moist clay measuring three feet across.\n\nThis version uses the 15 rules published in \"The Field\" in 1881 and has remained largely unchanged since that time. Played under the auspices of The National Quoits Association, formed in 1986.\n\nIn this game, the pins are 11 yards apart, with their tops protruding three to four inches above the clay. Quoits measure about 5½ inches in diameter and weigh around 5½ pounds.\n\nSometimes called the old game, this version is played in Wales and Scotland; Scotland had around a dozen clubs, now reduced to one which is based in Stonehaven, under the control of the Scottish Quoiting Association, whilst Wales has only a few clubs, based around Dyfed and Powys.\n\nIn this game, the top of the spike is flush with the clay, so encircling the pin is not a significant part of the game. The long game has similarities to the game of bowls, in that a player scores a point for each quoit nearer to the pin than his opponent. The hobs are 18 yards apart, while the quoits are typically around nine inches in diameter and weigh up to 11 pounds, almost double that of the northern game.\n\nAn English version of the long game, played using quoits of reduced size and weight. As with the long game, the hobs are 18 yards apart, but their tops are raised above the level of the clay. Quoits that land cleanly over the hob score two points, regardless of the opponent's efforts, and are removed immediately, prior to the next throw. Quoits which land on their backs, or inclined in a backwards direction, are also removed immediately\n\nTraditional American 4lb quoits. The standard for American Quoits is governed by the United States Quoiting Association. The USQA was created in April 2003. \n\nThe USQA unified a specific standard for the 4 Lb quoit. Each regulation set of USQA Quoits includes 4 foundry-cast steel quoits in perfect proportion to the historical Traditional American Quoit. Each quoit weighs 4 pounds and is approximately 6 1/2 inches in diameter, has a 3-inch diameter hole, and stands 1 inch high.\n\nSince 2003 the USQA has conducted annual tournaments culminating in a World Championship in both singles and doubles as well as a season ending points champion.\n\nMexican Americans play this game in the U.S. southwest and call it \"wacha\". \n\nExclusively a pub game, this variant is predominantly played in mid and south Wales and in England along its border with Wales.\n\nMatches are played by two teams (usually the host pub versus another pub) and typically consist of four games of singles, followed by three games of doubles. Players take it in turns to pitch four rubber rings across a distance of around 8½ feet onto a raised quoits board. The board consists of a central pin or spike and two recessed sections: an inner circular section called the dish and a circular outer section.\n\nFive points are awarded for a quoit landing cleanly over the pin, two points for a quoit landing cleanly in the dish, and one point for a quoit landing cleanly on the outer circular section of the board. The scoreboard consists of numbers running from 1 to 10, 11 or 12, and the object of the game is to score each of these numbers separately using four or fewer quoits, the first side to achieve this being the winner.\n\nDeck quoits is a variant which is popular on cruise ships. The quoits are invariably made of rope, so as to avoid damaging the ship's deck, but there are no universally agreed standards or rules - partly because of the game's informal nature and partly because the game has to adapt to the shape and area of each particular ship it is played upon.\n\nPlayers take it in turn to throw three or four hoops at a target which usually, though not always, consists of concentric circles marked on the deck. The centre point is called the jack. Occasionally this may take the form of a raised wooden peg, but more usually it is marked on the surface in the same way that the concentric circles are.\n\nThis is a popular outdoor variation played principally in and around Pennsylvania, USA (specifically the 'Slate Belt' which is in the Lehigh Valley). This game uses two one-pound rubber quoits per player, which are pitched at a short metal pin mounted on a heavy 24x24x1 inch slab of slate. The common pronunciation of quoits in the Slate Belt region is (qwaits).\n\nPlayers take turns throwing a quoit at the pin. The quoit nearest the pin gets one point. If one player has two quoits nearer the pin than either of his opponent's quoits, he gets two points. A quoit that encircles the pin (called a ringer) gets three points. If all four quoits are ringers, the player who threw the last ringer gets three points only; otherwise, the first player to make 21 points wins the game. For two or four players.\n\nThis version of the game exists largely as a form of recreation, or as a game of skill found typically at fairgrounds and village fetes.\n\nThere are no leagues or universally accepted standards of play and players normally agree upon the rules before play commences.\n\nGarden quoit and hoopla sets can be purchased in shops and usually involve players taking it in turns to throw rope or wooden hoops over one or more spikes.\n\nThe fairground version typically involves a person paying the stallholder for the opportunity to throw one or more wooden hoops over a prize, which if done successfully, they can keep. Generally speaking, the odds of winning are normally heavily weighted in favour of the stallholder unless the cost of play is higher than the value of the prize.\n\n\nIn the romance film \"Father Is a Bachelor\", two spinsters play quoits to determine who gets to marry William Holden's character.\n\n\n"}

O'Conor's work demonstrates Impressionist and Post-Impressionist influence.\n\nBorn in Milltown, Castleplunket, County Roscommon in Ireland, O'Conor attended the Metropolitan School and Royal Hibernian Academy early in his career. His father, Roderic Joseph O'Conor, acted as a justice of the peace and was appointed high sheriff of the county in 1863. His mother, Eleanor Mary, was brought up in a landowning family from Co Meath. The family relocated to Dublin when O'Conor was still a child. He studied at Ampleforth College, and like his classmate, Richard Moynan, travelled to Antwerp before moving to Paris to gain further experience. While in France, he was influenced by the Impressionists.\n\nIn 1892 O'Conor went to Pont-Aven in Brittany where he worked closely with a group of artists around the Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin, whom he befriended. His method of painting with textured strokes of contrasting colours also owed much to Van Gogh. His nephew, Patrick O'Connor (1909–97), was also a painter as well as a sculptor.\n\nO'Conor died in Nueil-sur-Layon, France in March 1940.\n\nIn March 2011 a work by O'Conor sold for £337,250 (€383,993). \"Landscape, Cassis\", an oil-on-canvas, was painted by O'Conor in the south of France in 1913 and sold at Sotheby's for significantly higher than the estimate price.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, O'Conor was one of a group of painters, writers and intellectuals who frequented the \"Chat Blanc\", a restaurant in the rue d'Odessa near the Gare Montparnasse in Paris, a group that included Gerald Kelly, Aleister Crowley and the young Somerset Maugham. O'Conor \"took an immediate dislike to Maugham, who later recalled that his presence at the table seemed to irritate the Irishman and he had only to venture a remark to have O'Conor attack it.\" Maugham had his revenge on O'Conor by using him as the basis for two fictional characters, O'Brien in \"The Magician\" and Clutton in \"Of Human Bondage\". Both portraits are unflattering: O'Brien is \"a failure whose bitterness has warped his soul so that, unforgiving of the success of others, he lashes out at any artist of talent\", while Clutton is \"a sardonic painter who is most cheerful when he can find a victim for his sarcasm\". However, it was through O'Conor that Maugham first became interested in Gauguin (Maugham travelled to Tahiti and based his novel \"The Moon and Sixpence\" on the life of Gauguin).\n\n\n"}

The total regional population is 3 million, while the urban centre where the government office is located has a population of 430,000 and forms the core of Chaoyang.\n\nKnown as China's 'fossil city', many important paleontological discoveries have been made in Chaoyang, and the Harqin region is the oldest currently known prehistoric site in northern China. Two of the most remarkable Early Cretaceous birds known to date were recovered in the vicinity of the Jiufotang Formation rocks and named \"Longipteryx chaoyangensis\" and \"Sapeornis chaoyangensis\" in reference to the city.\n\nThe name \"Chaoyang\" originates from a poem found in one of the oldest collections of Chinese poetry, the Shijing. \"A wutong tree grew on a mountain. A fenghuang bird perched at the top and sang towards the morning sun\" (Chaoyang's name means \"morning sun\" in Chinese). The eastern part of Chaoyang is home to a mountain that has been called Fenghuang Mountain since ancient times. In 1778, this mountain was connected with the poem from the Shijing and Chaoyang was given its current name.\n\nChaoyang has a long and rich history. The discovery of the over five-thousand-year-old Niuheliang Hongshan Cultural Ruins in the region has drawn attention to Chaoyang as one of the birthplaces of ancient Chinese culture. The area first appears in Chinese historical records as “Liucheng County” in the Early Han period of the 3rd century B.C. In 342 AD, King of the Former Yan, Murong Huang, made Chaoyang his capital under the name Longcheng, and the city remained the capital through the Later Yan and Northern Yan periods. Since this time, Chaoyang has functioned as a center of Buddhism in Northeast China, with the construction of Longxiang temple in 345 AD forming the beginning of Buddhist culture in the Northeast.\n\nThe Mongols seized Chaoyang and surrounding regions. It is very difficult to locate nomadic people, but when they submitted to the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Chaoyang was controlled by Chinggisid princes and descendants of Jelme. Their territories became Tümed Right Wing Banner, Kharachin Left Wing Banner, Kharachin Right Wing Banner, and Kharachin Middle Banner, all of which were under Josutu League.\n\nAlthough the Qin Dynasty officially prohibited the Chinese from immigrating to Mongol lands, the southernmost league of Mongolia was flooded by Chinese peasants. As a result, several Chinese prefectures were created within the Mongol lands, and the Chinese came under the jurisdiction of the neighboring Chengde-fu.\n\nIn 1891, a Chinese secret society named Jindandao raised a rebellion, massacring tens of thousands of Mongols and forcing survivors to flee northward.\n\nUnder Manchukuo, the eastern part of Chaoyang, including the city of Chaoyang, belonged to Kin-chow Province while the western part constituted Jehol Province. The People's Republic of China incorporated Chaoyang into Liaoning Province in 1955 although ethnic Mongols wished to join Inner Mongolia. It was declared a prefecture level city in 1984.\n\nChaoyang has a rather dry, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: \"Dwa\"), with cold but very dry winters, and hot, humid summers; spring and autumn are relatively brief. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, for an annual average of . A majority of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August alone. Due to the aridity, diurnal temperature variation is large, especially during spring and autumn, and averages annually. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 50% in July to 71% in January, the city averages 2,748 hours of bright sunshine annually.\n\nThe prefecture is divided into 7 administrative areas. There are 2 districts, 2 subordinate cities and 3 counties of which one county is an Autonomous County for the Mongolian minority.\n\nAgriculture forms the backbone of Chaoyang's economy. In addition to wheat, corn, beans, and potatoes, Chaoyang is also an important region for the growing of cotton and fruit. The city has also begun to venture into the production of shaji (sea-buckthorn berries), which have become popular in China because of their dual use as food and as medicine. Chaoyang is home to the largest man-made thicket of shaji.\n\nChaoyang has more than 1,600 industrial enterprises, manufacturing a wide range of products including steel, machinery, textiles, diesel engines, automobiles, and paper. Lingyuan Iron and Steel Works and the Liaoning Tyre Factory are two of the largest such enterprises.\n\nLiaoning, and in particular Chaoyang, has become the focus of great interest in the world of palaeontology. During the 1990s, many new, unique and fascinating fossils were discovered in this region. Some of the finds have completely revolutionised our ideas of dinosaurs and shed new light on the origin of birds. Chaoyang's fossils are in the Jiufotang Formation. These fossils include: \"Liaoxipterus\", a genus of ctenochasmatid pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Lower Cretaceous; \"Microraptor\", a feathered dinosaur; and several early birds such as \"Longipteryx\", \"Sapeornis\", \"Yanornis\" and \"Jeholornis\", an early bird. Insects have also been found such as Dictyoptera, a fossilised cockroach and Hymenoptera, a fossil bee, which also date to the Lower Cretaceous period. A local trade in rare fossils has developed in the wake of the finds, with an estimated sixty vendors gathering in one area, called Ancient Street.\n\n"}

It is situated in Park Town, Luton, and is down the line from London St Pancras between to the south and to the north. Its three-letter station code is LTN, also the IATA code for the airport.\n\nThe station is served by Thameslink operated trains on the Thameslink route and by East Midlands Railway.\n\nIt is situated approximately west of the airport, to which it is linked by a chargeable shuttle bus service.\n\nThe station was opened in 1999, specifically to serve Luton Airport. Initially it was linked to the airport by free shuttle buses operated by National Car Parks on behalf of the airport's owners. In January 2008 the free shuttle bus service was replaced by a more frequent, but chargeable, service provided by First Capital Connect. Now that Govia are once again operating Thameslink, the service is planned to revert to being free.\n\nIn November 2008, the station became the first on the Thameslink route to have its platforms extended in order to accommodate twelve-coach trains as part of the Thameslink Programme. In April 2013, a new northern entrance was opened on Kimpton Road, Luton.\n\nLuton DART, a light rail link is planned to link Luton Airport Parkway station to the airport. The £200 million link, scheduled to open in 2021, is being funded by Luton Borough Council and will be designed by the engineering firm Arup. The link will be operated 24 hours a day by an automated guided people mover which would offer a 5-minute transfer time between Parkway station and the airport terminal. The major challenge faced by railway engineers building a rail link here is that the railway station, although located adjacent to the airport perimeter, lies around 40 metres downhill from the airport. The project will involve the construction of bridges over the neighbouring A1081 dual carriageway and tunnels, along with three new stations. The light rail platforms at the Parkway station will be built on a new level above the current main line rail platforms. A planning application was submitted in 2016, and the link was approved by Luton Borough Council in June 2017.\n\nNegotiations are underway with the Department for Transport to extend the validity of the Oyster card contactless ticketing system to the airport by 2018. Contactless bank cards (but not Oystercards) became valid for journeys to and from London from October 2019.\n\nThe typical off peak service from this station as of 20 May 2018 is as follows:\n\nThameslink trains serve several stations in Central London, including London St Pancras International, Farringdon, City Thameslink, Blackfriars and London Bridge.\n\nThe station is connected to London Luton Airport by a shuttle bus which takes 10 minutes for the journey. Services run every 10 minutes during the day and connect with all trains calling at the station overnight. The service is provided by Thameslink, and through booking to the airport is available from all National Rail stations. Passengers without through tickets must pay an additional fare to use the buses.\n\nBus services on the Luton to Dunstable Busway Route A also connect Parkway to Luton Airport.\n\n"}

There are several reasons for this: handling the parchment renders one ritually impure and the often-fragile parchment is easily damaged.

{"id": "2019526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019526", "title": "QV66", "text": "QV66\n\nQV66 is the tomb of Nefertari, the Great Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses II, in Egypt's Valley of the Queens. It was discovered by Ernesto Schiaparelli (the director of the Egyptian Museum in Turin) in 1904. It is called the Sistine Chapel of Ancient Egypt. Nefertari, which means \"beautiful companion\", was Ramesses II's favorite wife; he went out of his way to make this obvious, referring to her as \"the one for whom the sun shines\" in his writings, built the Temple of Hathor to idolize her as a deity, and commissioned portraiture wall paintings. In the Valley of the Queens, Nefertari's tomb once held the mummified body and representative symbolisms of her, like what most Egyptian tombs consisted of. Now, everything had been looted except for two thirds of the 5,200 square feet of wall paintings. For what still remains, these wall paintings characterized Nefertari's character. Her face was given a lot of attention to emphasize her beauty, especially the shape of her eyes, the blush of her cheeks, and her eyebrows. Some paintings were full of lines and color of red, blue, yellow, and green that portrayed exquisite directions to navigating through the afterlife to paradise.\n\nA flight of steps cut out of the rock gives access to the antechamber, which is decorated with paintings based on Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead. This astronomical ceiling represents the heavens and is painted in dark blue, with a myriad of golden five-pointed stars. The east wall of the antechamber is interrupted by a large opening flanked by representation of Osiris at left and Anubis at right; this in turn leads to the side chamber, decorated with offering scenes, preceded by a vestibule in which the paintings portray Nefertari being presented to the gods who welcome her. On the north wall of the antechamber is the stairway that goes down to the burial chamber. This latter is a vast quadrangular room covering a surface area about 90 square meters, the astronomical ceiling of which is supported by four pillars entirely covered with decoration. Originally, the queen's red granite sarcophagus lay in the middle of this chamber. According to religious doctrines of the time, it was in this chamber, which the ancient Egyptians called the \"golden hall\" that the regeneration of the deceased took place. This decorative pictogram of the walls in the burial chamber drew inspirations from chapters 144 and 146 of the Book of the Dead: in the left half of the chamber, there are passages from chapter 144 concerning the gates and doors of the kingdom of Osiris, their guardians, and the magic formulas that had to be uttered by the deceased in order to go past the doors.\n\nThe tomb itself is primarily focused on the Queen’s life and on her death.\n\nOf the wall full of paintings, the \"Queen playing Draughts\" is a portrayal of Nefertari playing the game of Senet. A whole entire wall was dedicated to show the Queen at play, demonstrating the importance of the game of Senet. Interpretations have lead a physical boardgames of Senet may have possibly been stolen, along with the body and other symbolic images of Nefertari. Nefertari may have been very clever, and possibly have been a writer in her lifetime. ^4 This can be alluded because of a painting in the tomb of Nefertari coming before the god of writing and literacy to proclaim her title as a scribe. Nefertari lived an elegant life on earth, and she is also promised an elegant afterlife. Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead, which tells a spell for the Queen, is inscribed on the tomb. This spell is supposed to guide Nefertari on how to transform into a ba, which is a bird. For Nefertari to become a bird in the afterlife, it is promised freedom to move around.\n\nRamesses’ affection for his wife, as written on her tomb's walls, shows clearly that Egyptian queens were not simply marriages of convenience or marriages designed to accumulate greater power and alliances, but, in some cases at least, were actually based around some kind of emotional attachment. Also poetry written by Ramesses about his dead wife is featured on some of the walls of her burial chamber. (\"My love is unique — no one can rival her, for she is the most beautiful woman alive. Just by passing, she has stolen away my heart.\") Nefertari’s origins are unknown except that it is thought that she was a member of the nobility, although while she was queen her brother Amenmose held the position of Mayor of Thebes.\n\nBy contemporary standards, the real value of the paintings found within the tomb is that they are the best preserved and most detailed source of the ancient Egyptian’s journey towards the afterlife. The tomb features several extracts from the \"Book of the Dead\" from chapters 148, 94, 146, 17 and 144 and tells of all the ceremonies and tests taking place from the death of Nefertari up until the end of her journey, depicted on the door of her burial chamber, in which Nefertari is reborn and emerges from the eastern horizon as a sun disc, forever immortalized in victory over the world of darkness.\n\nThe details of the ceremonies concerning the afterlife also tell us much about the duties and roles of many major and minor gods during the reign of the 19th Dynasty in the New Kingdom. Gods mentioned on the tomb walls include Isis, Osiris, Anubis, Hathor, Neith, Serket, Ma'at, Wadjet, Nekhbet, Amunet, Ra and Nephthys.\n\nUnfortunately by the time that Schiaparelli rediscovered Nefertari’s tomb it had already been found by tomb raiders, who had stolen all the treasure buried with the Queen, including her sarcophagus and mummy. Parts of the mummy's knees were found in the burial chamber, and were taken to the Egyptian Museum in Turin by Schiaparelli, where they are still kept today.\n\nThe tomb was closed to the public in 1950 because of various problems that threatened the paintings, which are considered to be the best preserved and most eloquent decorations of any Egyptian burial site. The paintings are found on almost every available surface in the tomb, including thousands of stars painted on the ceiling of the burial chamber on a blue background to represent the sky.\n\nAfter the discovery of the tomb, scientists found deterioration in many paintings caused by water damage, bacterial growth, salt formation, and recently, the humidity of visitors' breath. In 1986, an operation to restore all the paintings within the tomb and to replace over 3,000 years worth of dust and soot with paper pasted to the fragile walls and ceilings to preserve the paintings was embarked upon by the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation and the Getty Conservation Institute; the actual restoration work began in 1988 and was completed in April 1992. Upon completion of the restoration work, Egyptian authorities decided to severely restrict public access to the tomb in order to preserve the delicate paintings found within. Five years later, Egypt's Prime Minister, Hisham Zazao, declared the tomb to be reopened to visitors, 150 visitors at a time. In 2006, the tomb was restricted to visitors once again, except for private tours of a maximum of 20 people purchasing a license for 3000 USD. \nAs of November 2019, holders of a 1400 EGP entry ticket or a premium Luxor pass can visit this tomb. To this day, the Getty Conservation Institute regularly monitors the tomb.\n\n"}

Occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, a massively destructive \"war of independence\" ensued, driven by an emergent Spanish nationalism. Spain was divided between the liberal ideas that were associated with revolutionary France and the reaction that followed as personified by the rule of Ferdinand VII. Ferdinand's rule included the loss of the Spanish colonies in the New World, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, in the 1810s and 1820s. A series of civil wars then broke out in Spain, pitting Spanish liberals and then republicans against conservatives, culminating in the Carlist Wars between the moderate Queen Isabella and her uncle, the reactionary Infante Carlos. Disaffection with Isabella's government from many quarters led to repeated military intervention in political affairs and to several revolutionary attempts against the government. Two of these revolutions were successful, the moderate Vicalvarada or \"Vicálvaro Revolution\" of 1854 and the more radical \"la Gloriosa\" (Glorious Revolution) in 1868. The latter marks the end of Isabella's monarchy. The brief rule of the liberal king Amadeo I of Spain ended in the establishment of the First Spanish Republic, only to be replaced in 1874 by the popular, moderate rule of Alfonso XII of Spain, which finally brought Spain into a period of stability and reform.\n\nThe Cádiz Cortes was the first national assembly to claim sovereignty in Spain. It represented the abolition of the old kingdoms. The opening session was held on 24 September 1810.\n\nBy the beginning of 1810, the Spanish forces under Central Junta's command, the independent government, had suffered serious military defeat, the Battle of Ocaña, the French forces took control of southern Spain, and forced the Spanish government to retreat to Cádiz, and being under siege by the French from 5 February 1810 to 24 August 1812, but was never captured (See the Siege of Cádiz). The \"Central Junta\" dissolved itself on 29 January 1810, and set up a five-person Regency. The five regents convened the meeting of the Cortes in Cadiz. It operated as a government in exile.\n\nThe Cortes Generales (\"General Courts\") refuge in Cádiz during the Peninsular War. The Cortes opened their sessions in September 1810 on the Isle of Leon. They consisted of 97 deputies, 47 of whom were alternates from Cadiz residents. The Cortes were representatives of the provinces but were unable to hold elections, either in Spain or Americas. The assembly thus try a territorial representation who approved a decree expressing represent the Spanish nation in which lay the national sovereignty over Spain and Americas.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1812 was established on 19 March 1812 by the Cádiz Cortes, Spain's first national sovereign assembly. It abolished the Inquisition and Absolute monarchy in Spain and Americas, and established the principles of universal male suffrage, national sovereignty, constitutional monarchy and freedom of the press, and supported land reform and free enterprise.\n\nOn 24 March 1814, six weeks after returning to Spain, Ferdinand VII abolished the constitution. King Ferdinand VII's refusal to agree to the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 on his accession to the throne in 1814 came as little surprise to most Spaniards; the king had signed on to agreements with the clergy, the church, and with the nobility in his country to return to the earlier state of affairs even before the fall of Napoleon. The decision to abrogate the Constitution was not welcomed by all, however. Liberals in Spain felt betrayed by the king who they had decided to support, and many of the local juntas that had pronounced against the rule of Joseph Bonaparte lost confidence in the king's rule. The army, which had backed the pronouncements, had liberal leanings that made the king's position tenuous. Even so, agreements made at the Congress of Vienna (where Spain was represented by Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador) starting a year later would cement international support for the old, absolutist regime in Spain.\n\nThe Spanish Empire in the New World had largely supported the cause of Ferdinand VII over the Bonapartist pretender to the throne in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars. Joseph had promised radical reform, particularly the centralization of the state, which would cost the local authorities in the American empire their autonomy from Madrid. The Spanish Americans, however, did not support absolutism and wanted auto-governance. The juntas in the Americas did not accept the governments of the Europeans, neither the French or Spaniards.\n\nA conspiracy of liberal mid-ranking officers in the expedition being outfitted at Cadiz mutinied before they were shipped to the Americas. Led by Rafael del Riego, the conspirators seized their commander and led their army around Andalusia hoping to gather support; garrisons across Spain declared their support for the would-be revolutionaries. Riego and his co-conspirators demanded that the liberal Constitution of 1812 be restored. Before the coup became an outright revolution, King Ferdinand agreed to the demands of the revolutionaries and swore by the constitution. A \"\"Progresista\"\" (liberal) government was appointed, though the king expressed his disaffection with the new administration and constitution.\n\nThree years of liberal rule (the \"Trienio Liberal\") followed. The \"Progresista\" government reorganized Spain into 52 provinces, and intended to reduce the regional autonomy that had been a hallmark of Spanish bureaucracy since Habsburg rule in the 16th and 17th centuries. The opposition of the affected regions – in particular, Aragon, Navarre, and Catalonia – shared in the king's antipathy for the liberal government. The anticlerical policies of the \"Progresista\" government led to friction with the Roman Catholic Church, and the attempts to bring about industrialization alienated old trade guilds. The Inquisition—which had been abolished by both Joseph Bonaparte and the Cádiz Cortes during the French occupation—was ended again by the \"Progresista\" government, summoning up accusations of being nothing more than \"afrancesados\" (Francophiles), who only six years before had been forced out of the country. More radical liberals attempted to revolt against the entire idea of a monarchy, constitutional or otherwise, in 1821; these republicans were suppressed, though the incident served to illustrate the frail coalition that bound the \"Progresista\" government together.\n\nThe election of a radical liberal government in 1823 further destabilized Spain. The army – whose liberal leanings had brought the government to power – began to waver when the Spanish economy failed to improve, and in 1823, a mutiny in Madrid had to be suppressed. The Jesuits (who had been banned by Charles III in the 18th century, only to be rehabilitated by Ferdinand VII after his restoration) were banned again by the radical government. For the duration of liberal rule, King Ferdinand (though technically head of state) lived under virtual house arrest in Madrid.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna ending the Napoleonic Wars had inaugurated the \"Congress system\" as an instrument of international stability in Europe. While Ferdinand had been rebuffed by the \"Holy Alliance\" of Russia, Austria, and Prussia in his request for help against the liberal revolutionaries in 1820, by 1822 the \"Concert of Europe\" was at sufficient unease with Spain's liberal government and its surprising hardiness that they were prepared to intervene on Ferdinand's behalf. In 1822, the Congress of Verona authorized France to intervene. Louis XVIII of France – himself an arch-reactionary – was only too happy to put an end to Spain's liberal experiment, and a massive army – the \"100,000 Sons of Saint Louis\" – was dispatched across the Pyrenees in April 1823. The Spanish army, fraught by internal divisions, offered little resistance to the well organised French force, who seized Madrid and reinstalled Ferdinand as absolute monarch. The liberals' hopes for a new Spanish War of Independence were not to be fulfilled.\n\nImmediately following the restoration of absolutist rule in Spain, King Ferdinand embarked on a policy intended to restore old conservative values to government; the Jesuit Order and the Spanish Inquisition were reinstated once more, and some autonomy was again devolved to the provinces of Aragon, Navarre, and Catalonia. Although he refused to accept the loss of the American colonies, Ferdinand was prevented from taking any further action against the rebels in the Americas by the opposition of the United Kingdom and the United States, who voiced their support of the new Latin American republics in the form of the Monroe Doctrine. The recent betrayal of the army demonstrated to the king that his own government and soldiers were untrustworthy, and the need for domestic stability proved to be more important than the reconquest of the Empire abroad. As a result, the destinies of Spain and her empire on the American mainland were to permanently take separate paths.\n\nAlthough in the interests of stability Ferdinand issued a general amnesty to all those involved in the 1820 coup and the liberal government that followed it, the original architect of the coup, Rafael del Riego, was executed. The liberal \"Partido Progresista\", however, continued to exist as a political force, even if it was excluded from actual policy-making by Ferdinand's restored government. Riego himself was hanged, and he would become a martyr for the liberal cause in Spain and would be memorialized in the anthem of the Second Spanish Republic, \"El Himno de Riego\", more than a century later.\n\nThe remainder of Ferdinand's reign was spent restoring domestic stability and the integrity of Spain's finances, which had been in ruins since the occupation of the Napoleonic Wars. The end of the wars in the Americas improved the government's financial situation, and by the end of Ferdinand's rule the economic and fiscal situation in Spain was improving. A revolt in Catalonia was crushed in 1827, but at large the period saw an uneasy peace in Spain.\n\nFerdinand's chief concern after 1823 was how to solve the problem of his own succession. He was married four times in his life, and bore two daughters in all his marriages; the succession law of Philip V of Spain, which still stood in Ferdinand's time, excluded women from the succession. By that law, Ferdinand's successor would be his brother, Carlos. Carlos, however, was a reactionary and an authoritarian who desired the restoration of the traditional moralism of the Spanish state, the elimination of any traces of constitutionalism, and a close relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Though surely not a liberal, Ferdinand was fearful of Carlos's extremism. War had broken out in neighboring Portugal in 1828 as a result of just such a conflict between reactionary and moderate forces in the royal family – the War of the Two Brothers.\n\nIn 1830, at the advice of his wife, Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Ferdinand decreed a Pragmatic Sanction that had the effect of fundamental law in Spain. As a result of the sanction, women were allowed to accede to the Spanish throne, and the succession would fall on Ferdinand's infant daughter, Isabella, rather than to his brother Carlos. Carlos – who disputed the legality of Ferdinand's ability to change the fundamental law of succession in Spain – left the country for Portugal, where he became a guest of Dom Miguel, the absolutist pretender in that country's civil war.\n\nFerdinand died in 1833, at the age of 49. He was succeeded by his daughter Isabella under the terms of the Pragmatic Sanction, and his wife, Maria Christina, became regent for her daughter, who at that time was only three years of age. Carlos disputed the legitimacy of Maria Christina's regency and the accession of her daughter, and declared himself to be the rightful heir to the Spanish throne. A half-century of civil war and unrest would follow.\n\nAlready in 1810, Caracas and Buenos Aires juntas declared their independence from the Bonapartist government in Spain and sent ambassadors to the United Kingdom. The British alliance with Spain had also moved most of the Latin American colonies out of the Spanish economic sphere and into the British sphere, with whom extensive trade relations were developed.\nSpanish liberals opposed to the abrogation of the Constitution of 1812 when Ferdinand's rule was restored, the new American states were cautious of abandoning their independence, and an alliance between local elites, merchant interests, nationalists rose up against the Spanish in the New World.\nAlthough Ferdinand was committed to the reconquest of the colonies, along with many of the Continental European powers, Britain was ostensibly opposed to the move which would limit her new commercial interests. Latin American resistance to Spanish reconquest of the colonies was compounded by uncertainty in Spain itself, over whether or not the colonies should be reconquered; Spanish liberals – including the majority of military officers – already disdainful of the monarchy's rejection of the constitution, were opposed to the restoration of an empire that they saw as an obsolete antique, as against the liberal revolutions in the New World with which they sympathized.\nThe arrival of Spanish forces in the American colonies began in 1814, and was briefly successful in restoring central control over large parts of the Empire. Simón Bolívar, the leader of revolutionary forces in New Granada, was briefly forced into exile in British-controlled Jamaica, and independent Haiti. In 1816, however, Bolívar found enough popular support that he was able to return to South America, and in a daring march from Venezuela to New Granada (Colombia), he defeated Spanish forces at the Battle of Boyacá in 1819, ending Spanish rule in Colombia. Venezuela was liberated on 24 June 1821 when Bolívar destroyed the Spanish army on the fields of Carabobo on the Battle of Carabobo. Argentina declared its independence in 1816 (though it had been operating with virtual independence as a British client since 1810 after successfully resisting a British invasion). Chile was retaken by Spain in 1814, but lost permanently in 1817 when an army under José de San Martín, crossed the Andes Mountains from Argentina to Chile, and went on to defeat Spanish royalist forces at the Battle of Chacabuco in 1817.\n\nMexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Central America still remained under Spanish control in 1820. King Ferdinand, however, was dissatisfied with the loss of so much of the Empire and resolved to retake it; a large expedition was assembled in Cadiz with the aim of reconquest. However the army was to create political problems of its own.\n\nJosé de San Martín, who had already helped to liberate Chile and Argentina, entered Peru in 1820. In 1821, the inhabitants of Lima invited him and his soldiers to the city. The viceroy fled into the interior of the country. From there he resisted successfully, and it was only with the arrival of Simón Bolívar and Antonio José de Sucre in 1823 that the Spanish royalist forces were defeated at the battles of Junin and Ayacucho, where the entire Spanish Army of Peru and the Viceroy were captured. The Battle of Ayacucho signified the end of the Spanish Empire on the American mainland.\n\nAlthough Mexico had been in revolt in 1811 under Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, resistance to Spanish rule had largely been confined to small guerrilla bands in the countryside. The coup in Spain did not change the centralized policies of the government of Trieno Liberal in Madrid and many Mexicans were disappointed. In 1821, Mexico led by Agustin de Iturbide and Vincente Guerrero presented the Plan de Iguala, calling for an independent Mexican monarchy, in response to the centralism and fears of the liberalism and anticlericalism in Spain. The liberal government of Spain showed less interest in the military reconquest of the colonies than Ferdinand, although it rejected the independence of Mexico in the failed Treaty of Córdoba. The last bastion of San Juan de Ulúa resisted to 1825, and Isidro Barradas tried to recapture Mexico from Cuba in 1829. With the king's death in 1833 Spain finally abandoned all plans of military re-conquest.\n\nAfter their fall from grace in 1823 at the hands of a French invasion, Spanish liberals had pinned their hopes on Ferdinand VII's wife, Maria Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, who bore some marks as a liberal and a reformer. However, when she became regent for her daughter Isabella in 1833, she made it clear to the court that she intended no such reforms. Even still, an alliance of convenience was formed with the \"progresista\" faction at court against the conservatives, who backed the rebel Infante Carlos of Spain.\n\nCarlos, who declared his support for the ancient, pre-Bourbon privileges of the \"fueros\", received considerable support from the Basque country, Aragon, and Catalonia, which valued their ancient privileges from Madrid. The insurrection seemed, at first, a catastrophic failure for the Carlists, who were quickly driven out of most of Aragon and Catalonia, and forced to cling to the uplands of Navarre by the end of 1833. At this crucial moment, however, Carlos named the Basque Tomás de Zumalacárregui, a veteran guerrilla of the Peninsular War, to be his commander-in-chief. Within a matter of months, Zumalacárregui reversed the fortunes of the Carlist cause and drove government forces out of most of Navarre, and launched a campaign into Aragon. By 1835, what was once a band of defeated guerrillas in Navarre had turned into an army of 30,000 in control of all of Spain north of the Ebro River, with the exception of the fortified ports on the northern coast.\n\nThe position of the government was growing increasingly desperate. Rumors of a liberal coup to oust Maria Cristina abounded in Madrid, compounding the danger of the Carlist army which was now within striking distance of the capital. Appeals for aid did not fall on deaf ears; France, which had replaced the reactionary monarchy of Charles X with the liberal monarchy of Louis-Philippe in 1830, was sympathetic to the Cristino cause. The Whig governments of Viscount Melbourne were similarly friendly, and organized volunteers and material aid for Spain. Still confident of his successes, however, Don Carlos joined his troops on the battlefield. While Zumalacárregui agitated for a campaign to take Madrid, Carlos ordered his commander to take a port on the coast. In the subsequent campaign, Zumalacárregui died after being shot in the calf. There was suspicion that Carlos, jealous of his general's successes and politics, conspired to have him killed.\n\nHaving failed to take Madrid, and having lost their popular general, the Carlist armies began to weaken. Reinforced with British equipment and manpower, Isabella found in the \"progressista\" general Baldomero Espartero a man capable of suppressing the rebellion; in 1836, he won a key victory at the Battle of Luchana that turned the tide of the war. After years of vacillation on the issue of reform, events compelled Maria Cristina to accept a new constitution in 1837 that substantively increased the powers of the Spanish parliament, the \"cortes\". The constitution also established state responsibility for the upkeep of the church, and a resurgence of anti-clerical sentiment, led to the disbandment of some religious orders which considerably reduced the strength of the Church in Spain. The Jesuits – expelled during the Trienio Liberal and readmitted by Ferdinand – were again expelled by the wartime regency in 1835.\n\nThe Spanish government was growing deeper in debt as the Carlist war dragged on, nearly to the point that it became insolvent. In 1836, the president of the government, Juan Álvarez Mendizábal, offered a program of \"desamortización\", the \"Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal\", that involved the confiscation and sale of church, mainly monastic, property. Many liberals, who bore anti-clerical sentiments, saw the clergy as having allied with the Carlists, and thus the \"desamortización\" was only justice. Mendizábal recognized, also, that immense amounts of Spanish land (much of it given as far back as the reigns of Philip II and Philip IV) were in the hands of the church lying unused – the church was Spain's single largest landholder in Mendizábal's time. The Mendizábal government also passed a law guaranteeing freedom of the press.\n\nAfter Luchana, Espartero's government forces successfully drove the Carlists back northward. Knowing that much of the support for the Carlist cause came from supporters of regional autonomy, Espartero convinced the Queen-Regent to compromise with the \"fueros\" on the issue of regional autonomy and retain their loyalty. The subsequent Convention of Vergara in 1839 was a success, protecting the privileges of the \"fueros\" and recognizing the defeat of the Carlists. Don Carlos again went into exile.\n\nFreed from the Carlist threat, Maria Cristina immediately embarked on a campaign to undo the Constitution of 1837, provoking even greater ire from the liberal quarters of her government. Failing in the attempt to overthrow her own constitution, she attempted to undermine the rule of the municipalities in 1840; this proved to be her undoing. She was forced to name the \"progressista\" hero of the Carlist War, General Espartero, president of the government. Maria Cristina resigned the regency after Espartero attempted a program of reform.\n\nIn the absence of a regent, the \"cortes\" named Espartero to that post in May 1841. Although a noted commander, Espartero was inexperienced with politics and his regency was markedly authoritarian; it was arguably Spain's first experience with military rule. The government wrangled with Espartero over the choice of Agustín Argüelles, a radical liberal politician, as the young queen's tutor. From Paris, Maria Cristina railed against the decision and attracted the support of the \"moderados\" in the \"Cortes\". The war heroes Manuel de la Concha and Diego de León attempted a coup in September 1841, attempting to seize the queen, only months after Espartero was named regent. The severity with which Espartero crushed the rebellion led to considerable unpopularity; the \"Cortes\", increasingly rebellious against him, selected an old rival, José Ramón Rodil y Campillo, as their chief minister. Another uprising in Barcelona in 1842 against his free trade policies prompted him to bombard the city, serving only to loosen his tenuous grip on power. On 20 May 1843, Salustiano Olózaga delivered his famous \"Dios salve al país, Dios salve a la reina!\" (God save the country, God save the queen!) speech that led to a strong moderate-liberal coalition that opposed Espartero. This coalition sponsored a third and final uprising led by generals Ramón Narváez and Francisco Serrano, who finally overthrew Espartero in 1843, after which the deposed regent fled to England.\n\nThe \"cortes\", now exasperated by serial revolutions, coups, and counter-coups, decided not to name another regent, and instead declared that the 13-year-old Isabella II was of age. Isabella, now inundated with the competing interests of courtiers espousing an array of ideologies and interests, vacillated as her mother did between them, and served to aggravate those genuinely interested in progress and reform. Salustiano Olózaga was named the first president of the government after Espartero's fall. His commission to form a government was, however, highly unpopular with the \"cortes\"; he allegedly received the authority to dissolve the \"cortes\" from the queen, but the queen within days withdrew her support for the plan, and cast her lot behind Olózaga's opponent in the \"cortes\", the Minister of State Luis González Bravo. Olózaga was accused of obtaining the order of dissolution by forcing Queen Isabella to sign against her will. Olózaga had to resign, having only been President of the Government for an ephemeral fifteen days. Olózaga, a liberal, was succeeded by Luis González Bravo, a moderate, inaugurating a decade of \"moderado\" rule. President Luis González Bravo was Isabella's first stable president during her effective kingdom, ruling for 6 straight months (from that moment on he would remain loyal to the queen until the end of her kingdom, acting as her very last president decades later at the outbreak of the 1868 Revolution). Isabella's kingdom was to include unstable administration, policies, and governments, due to the various opposition parties that continuously wanted to take over her government – in 1847, for instance, she went through five Presidents of the Government.\n\nLuis González Bravo, leading the moderate faction, dissolved the \"cortes\" himself and ruled by royal decree. He declared Spain to be in a state of siege and dismantled a number of institutions that had been set up by the \"progressista\" movement such as elected city councils. Fearing another Carlist insurrection in northern Spain, he established the Guardia Civil, a force merging police and military functions to retain order in the mountainous regions that had been the Carlists' base of support and strength, so as to defend Isabella's rightful kingdom from her enemies.\n\nA new constitution, authored by the \"moderados\" was written in 1845. It was backed by the new Narváez government begun in May 1844, led by General Ramón Narváez, one of the original architects of the revolution against Espartero. A series of reforms promulgated by Narváez's government attempted to stabilize the situation. The \"cortes\", which had been uneasy with the settlement with the \"fueros\" at the end of the First Carlist War, were anxious to centralize the administration. The law of 8 January 1845 did just that, stifling local autonomy in favor of Madrid; the act contributed to the revolt of 1847 and the revival of Carlism in the provinces. The Electoral Law of 1846 limited the suffrage to the wealthy and established a property bar for voting. In spite of Bravo and Narváez's efforts to suppress the unrest in Spain, which included lingering Carlist sentiments and \"progressista\" supporters of the old Espartero government, Spain's situation remained uneasy. A revolt led by Martín Zurbano in 1845 included the support of key generals, including Juan Prim, who was imprisoned by Narváez.\n\nNarváez ended the sale of church lands promoted by the \"progresistas\". This put him into a difficult situation, as the \"progresistas\" had had some progress in improving Spain's financial situation through those programs. The Carlist War, the excesses of Maria Cristina's regency, and the difficulties of the Espartero government left the finances in a terrible situation. Narváez entrusted the finances to the minister Alejandro Mon, who embarked on an aggressive program to restore solvency to Spain's finances; in this he was remarkably successful, reforming the tax system which had been badly neglected since the reign of Charles IV. With its finances more in order, the government was able to rebuild the military and, in the 1850s and 1860s, embark on successful infrastructure improvements and campaigns in Africa that are often cited as the most productive aspects of Isabella's reign.\n\nIsabella was convinced by the \"Cortes\" to marry her cousin, a Bourbon prince, Francis, Duke of Cádiz. Her younger sister Maria Louisa Fernanda was married to the French king Louis-Philippe's son Antoine, Duke of Montpensier. The Affair of the Spanish Marriages threatened to break the alliance between Britain and France, which had come to a different agreement over the marriage. France and Britain nearly went to war over the issue before it was resolved; the affair contributed to the fall of Louis-Philippe in 1848. Fury raged in Spain over the queen's nonchalance with the national interest and worsened her public image.\n\nPartly as a result of this, a major rebellion broke out in northern Catalonia in 1846, the Second Carlist War. Rebels led by Rafael Tristany launched a guerilla campaign against government forces in the region and pronounced themselves in favor of Carlos, Conde de Montemolin, carrier of the Carlist cause and son of Infante Carlos of Spain. The rebellion grew, and by 1848 it was relevant enough that Carlos sponsored it himself and named Ramón Cabrera as commander of the Carlist armies in Spain. A force of 10,000 men was raised by the Carlists; in response to fears of further escalation Narváez was again named President of the Government in Madrid in October 1847. The biggest battle of the war, the Battle of Pasteral (January 1849) was inconclusive; Cabrera, however, was wounded and lost confidence. His departure from Spain caused the rebellion dissolve by May 1849. The Second Carlist War, though contemporaneous with the revolutions of 1848, is rarely included as part of the same phenomenon, since the rebels in Spain were not fighting for liberal or socialist ideas, but rather conservative and even absolutist ones.\n\nRamón Narváez was succeeded by Juan Bravo Murillo, a practical man and a seasoned politician. Murillo carried the same authoritarian tendencies as Narváez but made serious efforts to advance Spanish industry and commerce. He surrounded himself with technocrats who attempted to take an active role in the advancement of the Spanish economy. An aggressive policy of financial reform was coupled with an equally aggressive policy of infrastructure improvement enabled by Alejandro Mon's financial reforms in the preceding decade. A serious effort to build a rail network in Spain was begun by the Murillo government.\n\nMurillo, facing the issue of anti-clericalism, signed a concordat with the Vatican on the issue of religion in Spain; it was conclusively decided that Roman Catholicism remained the state religion of Spain, but that the contribution of the church in education would be regulated by the state. In addition, the state renounced \"desamortización\", the process of selling church lands. Murillo's negotiations with the Papacy were aided by Narváez's role in the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states, where he had led Spanish soldiers in the pope's defense against revolutionaries.\n\nMurillo, flush with economic and international successes, announced a series of policies on 2 December 1852 to the \"cortes\". Prominent among the reforms he suggested were the reduction of the powers of the \"cortes\" as a whole in favor of Murillo's office as president of the government, and the ability for the executive to legislate by decree in times of crisis. Twelve days later, the \"cortes\" successfully convinced the queen to sack Murillo and find a new minister.\n\nThe next president of the government, Federico Roncali, governed briefly, and did well to maintain a civil atmosphere with the \"cortes\" after Murillo's flamboyance. The army, dissatisfied with Roncali a few months later, convinced the queen to oust him, replacing him with General Francisco Lersundi. The \"cortes\", which by then were unsatisfied with the army's intervening in government affairs, arranged for Luis José Sartorius, the Count of San Luis, to be named president of the government. Sartorius – who had gained power only by betraying Luis González Bravo and following the fortunes of General Narváez – was notorious for falsifying election results in favor of his co-conspirators and himself. His appointment as President of the Government drew violent agitation from the liberal wing of the Spanish government.\n\nIn July 1854, a major rebellion broke out bringing together a wide coalition of outrages against the state. The Crimean War, which had broken out in March of that year, had led to an increase in grain prices across Europe and a famine in Galicia. Riots against the power loom erupted in the cities, and \"progresistas\" outraged at a decade of \"moderado\" dictatorship and the corruption of the Sartorius government broke out in revolution. General Leopoldo O'Donnell took the lead in the revolution; after the indecisive Battle of Vicálvaro, he issued the Manifesto of Manzanares that pronounced himself in favor of Spain's former \"progresista\" dictator, Baldomero Espartero, the man that O'Donnell had actively rebelled against in 1841. The \"moderado\" government collapsed before them and Espartero returned to politics at the head of an army.\n\nEspartero was named president of the government, this time by the very queen for whom he had been regent ten years before. Espartero, indebted to O'Donnell for restoring him to power but concerned about having to share power with another man, tried to get him installed to a post as far away from Madrid as possible – in this case, in Cuba. The attempt failed and only alienated Espartero's colleague; instead, O'Donnell was given a seat in Espartero's cabinet as war minister, though his influence was greater than his portfolio.\n\nThe two caudillos, who came into power with immense popularity, attempted to reconcile their differences and form a coalition party that crossed the \"progresista-moderado\" lines that had dominated and restricted Spanish politics since the Peninsular War. The \"Unión Liberal\", as it was called, attempted to forge a policy based on progress in industry, infrastructure, public works, and a national compromise on constitutional and social issues.\n\nEspartero attempted to rebuild the \"progresista\" government after ten years of \"moderado\" reform. Most of Espartero's tenure was absorbed into promulgating the new constitution he intended to replace the \"moderado\" constitution of 1845. The resistance of the \"cortes\", however, meant that most of his term was spent deadlocked; the coalition that Espartero relied on was built on both liberals and moderates, who disagreed fundamentally on the ideology of the new constitution and policies. Espartero's constitution included provisions for the freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and, most importantly, a more liberal suffrage than the Constitution of 1845 allowed for. Even before the constitution had been passed, Espartero endorsed Pascual Madoz's \"desamortización\" against communal lands in Spain; the plan was strongly opposed not only by the \"moderados\" in the \"cortes\", but also by the queen and General O'Donnell. Espartero's coalition with O'Donnell collapsed, and the queen named O'Donnell president of the government. He too proved unable to work with the government in any meaningful way; he attempted to compromise Espartero's constitution with the 1845 document by, in a bald assertion of power, declaring the 1845 constitution restored with certain specified exceptions, with or without the approval of the \"cortes\". The act led to O'Donnell's ousting; the \"Constitution of 1855\" was never successfully put into place.\n\nAgain, Ramón María Narváez, the symbol of reaction, returned to politics and was named president of the government by Isabella in 1856, who switched her favor to the \"moderados\"; Espartero, frustrated and bitter with political life, retired permanently to Logroño. Narváez's new government undid what little Espartero had been able to accomplish while in office; the Constitution of 1845 was restored in its entirety and the legislation that Espartero had put forward was entirely reversed in a matter of months. Isabella grew weary of this, too, and a moderate conservative with a less offensive authoritarian character was found in Francisco Armero Peñaranda, who took power in October 1857. Without Narváez's authoritarian touch, however, Peñaranda found that it was now as difficult for conservative policies to be successfully enacted by the \"cortes\" as it was for Espartero's \"progresista\" policies; the \"moderado\" faction was now divided, with some favoring O'Donnell's \"Unión Liberal\" ideal. Isabella then sacked Peñaranda – to the ire of the \"moderados\" – and replaced him with Francisco Javier Istúriz. Istúriz, though Isabella admired him, lacked any support from the conservative wing of the government, and was adamantly opposed by Bravo Murillo. Isabella was then disgusted with the \"moderados\" in any form; O'Donnell's faction was able to give the \"Unión Liberal\" another chance in 1858.\n\nThis government – the longest-lasting of all of Isabella's governments – lasted nearly five years before it was deposed in 1863. O'Donnell, reacting against the extremism that came from Espartero's government and the \"moderado\" governments that followed it, managed to pull some results from a functional \"Unión Liberal\" coalition of centrist, conciliatory \"moderados\" and \"progresistas\", all of whom were exhausted from partisan bickering. O'Donnell's ministry was successful enough in restoring stability at home that they were able to project power abroad, which also helped to pull popular and political attention away from the \"cortes\"; Spain supported the French expedition to Cochinchina, the allied expedition sent in support of the French intervention in Mexico and Emperor Maximilian, an expedition to Santo Domingo, and most importantly, a successful campaign into Morocco that earned Spain a favorable peace and new territories across the Strait of Gibraltar. O'Donnell, even while president of the government, personally took command of the army in this campaign, for which he was named \"Duque de Tetuán\". A new agreement was made with the Vatican in 1859 that reopened the possibility of legal \"desamortizaciones\" of church property. The previous year, Juan Prim, whilst a general, had either allowed Jews back onto Spanish territory for the first time since the Alhambra Decree in 1492, or he would do so in 1868. \n\nThe coalition broke apart in 1863 when old factional lines broke O'Donnell's cabinet: the issue of \"desamortización\", brought up again, antagonized the two wings of the \"Unión Liberal.\" The \"moderados\", sensing an opportunity, attacked O'Donnell for being too liberal, and succeeded in turning the queen and \"cortes\" against him; his government collapsed on 27 February 1863.\n\nThe \"moderados\" immediately took to undoing O'Donnell's legislation but Spain's economic situation took a turn for the worse; when Alejandro Mon, who had already saved Spain's finances, proved ineffectual, Isabella turned to her old warhorse, Ramón Narváez, in 1864 to make certain that things did not get out of hand; this only infuriated the \"progresistas\", who were promptly rewarded for their agitation by another O'Donnell government. General Juan Prim launched a major uprising against the government during O'Donnell's administration that prefigured future events; the rebellion was crushed brutally by O'Donnell, prompting the same sort of criticism that had toppled Espartero's government years earlier. The queen, listening to the opinion of the \"cortes\", again sacked O'Donnell, and replaced him with Narváez, who had just been sacked two years earlier.\n\nNarváez's support for the queen by this time was lukewarm; he had been sacked and seen enough governments thrown out by the queen in his lifetime that he, and much of the \"cortes\" had great doubts about her ability. The consensus spread; since 1854, a Republican party had been growing in strength, roughly in step with the fortunes of the \"Unión Liberal\", and indeed, the \"Unión\" had been in coalition with the Republicans at times in the \"cortes\".\n\nThe 1866 rebellion led by Juan Prim and the revolt of the sergeants at San Gil sent a signal to Spanish liberals and republicans that there was serious unrest with the state of affairs in Spain that could be harnessed if it were properly led. Liberals and republican exiles abroad made agreements at Ostend in 1866 and Brussels in 1867. These agreements laid the framework for a major uprising, this time not merely to replace the president of the government with a liberal, but to overthrow Isabella herself, whom Spanish liberals and republicans began to see as the source of Spain's ineffectuality.\n\nHer continual vacillation between liberal and conservative quarters had, by 1868, outraged \"moderados\", \"progresistas\", and members of the \"Unión Liberal\" and enabled, ironically, a front that crossed party lines. Leopoldo O'Donnell's death in 1867 caused the \"Unión Liberal\" to unravel; many of its supporters, who had crossed party lines to create the party initially, joined the growing movement to overthrow Isabella in favor of a more effective regime.\n\nThe die was cast in September 1868, when naval forces under admiral Juan Bautista Topete mutinied in Cadiz – the same place that Rafael del Riego had launched his coup against Isabella's father a half-century before. Generals Juan Prim and Francisco Serrano denounced the government and much of the army defected to the revolutionary generals on their arrival in Spain. The queen made a brief show of force at the Battle of Alcolea, where her loyal \"moderado\" generals under Manuel Pavía were defeated by General Serrano. Isabella then crossed into France and retired from Spanish politics to Paris, where she would remain until her death in 1904.\n\nThe revolutionary spirit that had just overthrown the Spanish government lacked direction; the coalition of liberals, moderates, and republicans were now faced with the incredible task of finding a government that would suit them better than Isabella. Control of the government passed to Francisco Serrano, an architect of the revolution against Baldomero Espartero's dictatorship. The \"cortes\" initially rejected the notion of a republic; Serrano was named regent while a search was launched for a suitable monarch to lead the country. A truly liberal constitution was written and successfully promulgated by the \"cortes\" in 1869 – the first such constitution in Spain since 1812.\n\nThe search for a suitable king proved to be quite problematic for the \"Cortes\". The republicans were, on the whole, willing to accept a monarch if he was capable and abided by a constitution. Juan Prim, a perennial rebel against the Isabelline governments, was named chief of the government in 1869 and remarked that \"to find a democratic king in Europe is as hard as to find an atheist in Heaven!\" The aged Espartero was brought up as an option, still having considerable sway among the \"progresistas\"; even after he rejected the notion of being named king, he still gained eight votes for his coronation in the final tally. Many proposed Isabella's young son Alfonso (the future Alfonso XII of Spain), but many thought that he would invariably be dominated by his mother and would inherit her flaws. Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, the former regent of neighboring Portugal, was sometimes raised as a possibility. A nomination offered to Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen would trigger the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nIn August 1870, an Italian prince, Amadeo of the House of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, was selected. The younger son of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, Amadeo had less of the troublesome political baggage that a German or French claimant would bring, and his liberal credentials were strong. He was duly elected King as Amadeo I of Spain on 3 November 1870. He landed in Cartagena on 27 November, the same day that Juan Prim was assassinated while leaving the \"Cortes\". Amadeo swore upon the general's corpse that he would uphold Spain's constitution.\n\nHowever, Amadeo had no experience as king, and what experience his father as King of Italy could offer was nothing compared to the extraordinary instability of Spanish politics. Amadeo was instantly confronted with a \"Cortes\" that regarded him as an outsider, even after it had elected him King; politicians conspired with and against him; and a Carlist uprising was taking place. In February 1873, he declared the people of Spain to be \"ungovernable\" and abandoned his kingdom, leaving rebel Republicans and Carlists to battle over the country.\n\nThe Napoleonic wars had severe negative effects on Spain's economic development. The Peninsular war ravaged towns and countryside alike. There was a sharp decline in population in many areas, caused by casualties, outmigration, and disruption of family life. The demographic impact was the worst of any Spanish war. The marauding armies seized farmers crops; more important, farmers lost much of their livestock, their main capital asset. Severe poverty was widespread, reducing market demand. The disruption of local and international trade, and the shortages of critical inputs, seriously hurt industry and services. The loss of a vast colonial empire reduced overall wealth. Spain by 1820 had become one of Europe's poorest and least-developed societies. Illiteracy characterized three-fourths of the people. Natural resources such as coal and iron existed but the transportation system was rudimentary, with few canals and navigable rivers. Road travel was slow and expensive. British railroad builders were pessimistic about the potential for freight and passenger traffic and did not invest. Eventually a small railway system was built radiating from Madrid, and bypassing the natural resources. The government relied on high tariffs, especially on grain, which further slowed economic development. For example, eastern Spain was unable to import inexpensive Italian wheat, and had to rely on expensive homegrown products carted in over poor roads. The export market collapsed apart from some agricultural products. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2019565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019565", "title": "Twenty20 in England in 2005", "text": "Twenty20 in England in 2005\n\nTwenty20 cricket is played over 20 overs according to normal limited-over rules, the one exception being the rule for \"timed out\", where the time by which an incoming batsman must be at the crease ready to receive his first ball is reduced to 90 seconds after the outgoing batsman has been dismissed. This amendment to the rules helps speed up the game. Additionally, boundary ropes tend to be shorter in Twenty20 cricket than for normal limited over games.\n\n2005 marks the third running of the Twenty20 Cup, which was won by Somerset when they beat Lancashire at the Oval on 30 July. It also saw England play their first Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl in Southampton, and winning by 100 runs (see below).\n\nThere was also a further development, as Leicestershire won approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board to host an International Twenty20 competition at the end of the season, although they are having to call it 20:20 to get round trademark issues. It will be competed over 15, 16 and 17 September between Leicestershire Foxes, Somerset Sabres, Nashua Titans, a Lashings World XI, the PCA Masters and the Asian XI.\n\nThe Australians beat the PCA Masters XI by 8 wickets\n\nThe 2005 Ashes tour started with the Australians taking on a Professional Cricketers' Association eleven at the picturesque ground at Arundel in a Twenty20 game. A crowd of 11,000 turned up to see the tourists win with one ball to spare, although in practice the result was always clear after an opening partnership of 131 between Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. The Aussies got an ideal start as Stephen Fleming edged Brett Lee's first delivery to the slips and the Masters XI were 0 for 1, having been put in to bat by Australia. Darren Maddy made 70 in 57 balls and Paul Collingwood (38) and Mark Ealham (39) also scored runs, but the rest of the team made little impression as the PCA Masters XI made 167 for 6. The Aussies lost only two wickets in making their target. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nEngland started cautiously in the only Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl, only hitting six runs off the first two overs as they saw off the bowlers, but Geraint Jones then decided to have fun with Brett Lee. Hitting two boundaries off the next over, Lee was hit for 14, and England moved rapidly to 28 for no loss before Jones cut McGrath to deep third man, where Kasprowicz took a catch on the boundary – out for 19 with four fours. Marcus Trescothick hit a single to end the over, but England were happy enough with 29 for 1 after four overs. Lee's next over was, again, hit for 14, as Lee served up one wide and a no-ball to end with three overs for 31 as singles were taken off every ball. That prompted a bowling change, with Michael Kasprowicz coming on for Australia, and with good reward, as the penultimate ball of his over was caught by Symonds at midwicket – Andrew Flintoff out for 6. Kevin Pietersen managed to scamper a single, and after six overs, England were 50 for 2.\n\nWith Jason Gillespie coming on, England continued to take the singles, although the fielding restrictions were off and Australia could stop more of those. However, Michael Clarke at deep backward point handed England three runs in the seventh over with a misfield. Pietersen continued to dominate the Australian bowling, smashing a four and a two off Gillespie, as England took ten runs off the eighth over. Australia looked clueless – a rare sight – as they continued to give runs away through misfields, and Kevin Pietersen smashed his way to 33 not out off 16 balls – after ten overs, England were 93 for 2, and looking to set a massive target.\n\nThe Australian captain Ricky Ponting brought on part-time spinner Michael Clarke to bowl the eleventh over, and got immediate success, when Pietersen launched him to Matthew Hayden on the fifth ball, but England were still 101 for 3 after eleven overs. In the next over, the new batsman Michael Vaughan edged Andrew Symonds' ball to midwicket, and the pressure was suddenly on the English. With Trescothick out for 41 a bit later to an attempted sweep off Symonds, England were suddenly looking down a hole after a fine start, and Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood slowed the scoring, to see England 111 for 5 with six overs to play. However, a slog sweep from Collingwood to end the fifteenth over turned the match again, as it went away for six and England moved to 124 for 5. With Jason Gillespie being brought back, Collingwood led the charge, as England stole seventeen runs off the seventeenth over and wrought control of the game again. Despite Andrew Strauss being bowled by Gillespie for 18, Collingwood hit another two boundaries towards the end of the over, to move onto 42 not out and the team score to 167 for 6. Vikram Solanki was out in the next over for 9, caught by Hussey off McGrath, and on the last ball, Collingwood was caught by for 46. Still, England would be pleased with 179 for 8, the highest score on the Rose Bowl in Twenty20 matches.\n\nAustralia started shakily, with Adam Gilchrist playing-and-missing and edging one shot over Andrew Strauss at third man, who miscued the path of the ball, as the Australians got eight off the first over bowled by Darren Gough. With Gilchrist finally taking one liberty too many, an easy catch was given, and Kevin Pietersen took it to remove arguably the most dangerous batsman in this format. On the next ball, Hayden was out, caught by Pietersen for 6. Symonds survived the next ball, but odds had improved for England, as the visitors were now 23 for 2. What followed was an Australian collapse – Michael Clarke went for a golden duck to Lewis, a slightly dubious decision, but that gave the English the needed momentum. Within the next four overs, Australia had lost four more wickets for eight runs, Symonds for 0, Hussey for 1, Ponting for 0, Martyn for 4, and despite a recovery from Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee, the required run rate ran away to 12 an over from the last eleven overs. Jon Lewis finished his spell with four wickets for 24 – a special international debut, even though it was only in a Twenty20 game. Despite a good recovery and a partnership of 36, Gillespie eventually holed out a catch to Marcus Trescothick off the hero of the match, Paul Collingwood, and England headed even further towards a victory. Eventually, McGrath was bowled by Harmison, ending the innings for 79 all out – exactly the same score that England succumbed to in the fourth innings chase against the Australians in the first Test of the last Ashes.\n\nInternational XI won by six wickets\n\nDespite South African international Shaun Pollock only bowling two of a possible four overs, Brian Lara again using plenty of bowlers as captainof the International XI, the Asia XI were bowled out for 157 thanks to patient bowling from the retired Adam Hollioake, who took three for 16 – the three wickets being a hat-trick of Rahul Dravid, Chaminda Vaas and Anil Kumble. Former Australian batsman Greg Blewett then smashed five sixes in a massive 91 not out, and with good help from Scott Styris who made 39 not out from number six, the International XI won by six wickets.\n\nSussex (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by nine wickets\n\nEssex Eagles collapsed to lose their first match of the 2005 Twenty20 Cup to Sussex Sharks. Winning the toss and batting, Essex quickly made their way to 55 for 1, with Ronnie Irani hitting 34 off 18 balls. But two quick wickets set them back, Andy Flower was then run out, and Mushtaq Ahmed ended their innings with five for 11 from 21 deliveries – as Essex ended all out for 109. In a stately reply, Sussex did not hurry too much, as Matt Prior scored 66 off 50 balls, and 14 extras helped the Sharks past the target after 14.4 overs.\n\nSurrey (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by seven wickets\n\nIn front of a full house at Beckenham, Mohammad Akram of the visiting Surrey Lions served up a rare maiden in Twenty20 cricket as Kent Spitfires were tied down to 140 for 8 off their twenty overs, despite Martin van Jaarsveld scoring a fifty. James Benning then made batting easy for Surrey, scoring ten fours and two sixes in a crackling 66. Surrey eventually won comparatively easily, having four overs left when they reached 141 for 3.\n\nMiddlesex (2pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 18 runs\n\nOwais Shah made a good attempt at getting the highest strike-rate of the opening day of Twenty20 cricket, recording 72 runs off only 30 balls to lift Middlesex Crusaders to an unassailable 210 for 6. For Hampshire Hawks, Shane Warne showed somewhat poor captaincy when Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine was the eighth man to come on to bowl – and then took two for 13 from two overs. New Zealander Craig McMillan, meanwhile, conceded twenty-eight runs from his only over. Despite Nic Pothas scoring 59 off 39 balls, the Hawks were nowhere near keeping up with the required pace, and Middlesex bowler Irfan Pathan was a main cause of that – he took three for 16 from four overs, as Hampshire finished on 192 for 7.\n\nGlamorgan (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) on losing fewer wickets\n\nJames Hildreth scored a quick 46 off 26 deliveries at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had control over the Somerset batsmen, and yet they lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth got the better of them and took wickets at a leisure – however, Alex Wharf hung in there with Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, which of course was pleasing to the home side.\n\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one run\n\nIn the local battle at New Road, Worcestershire Royals eked out a victory over rivals Warwickshire Bears. Graeme Hick and Ben Smith both made big scores, with 67 and 47, and skipper Gareth Batty also made 21 to send Worcestershire to 177 for 7. Warwickshire then collapsed to accurate bowling, losing their entire top order except Jonathan Trott to end up on 68 for 5 – but Michael Powell made 40 not out batting at seven, turning the innings almost back to Warwickshire's favour. In the end, however, they were two runs short, their No. 11 Nick Warren only managing to hit one off the two balls he faced.\n\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 81 runs\n\nThe Gloucestershire Gladiators took a massive beating by the Northamptonshire Steelbacks in their match at Milton Keynes. Despite Gloucestershire's Martyn Ball taking two for 18 from four overs, positively economical, five no-balls and the fact that 16 overs had to be found from bowlers other than Ball allowed Northamptonshire to run away to 224 for 5 – a Twenty20 Cup record . David Sales top-scored for the hosts with 78 not out, while Australian Damien Wright paired up with him for 84 for the sixth wicket, scoring an unbeaten 38 of his own. Gloucestershire were in trouble from the start, as opening batsman Craig Spearman was run out for a duck, and when Wright ripped out two more wickets, the Gladiators were 10 for three. Four wickets from Ben Phillips resulted in a serious collapse, as Gloucestershire were all out for 143.\n\nLeicestershire (2pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nA disciplined bowling and fielding effort, conceding only five extras, was the key to Leicestershire Foxes' win at Grace Road. Nottinghamshire Outlaws won the toss and batted first, but after Nottinghamshire skipper Stephen Fleming found four boundaries in his twelve-ball 24, Jeremy Snape and Dinesh Mongia tied down the Nottinghamshire batsmen. Only Leicestershire seamer Darren Maddy, who bowled two overs for 33, gave the visitors' total score of 143 for 8 a glimmer of respect. The chase was close and exciting, however, as Leicestershire lost HD Ackerman and Maddy in succession to go to 16 for 2. At 103 for 5, things looked grim, but a crucial partnership between Paul Nixon and Ottis Gibson won them the game with four balls to spare.\n\nDerbyshire (2pts) beat Durham (0pts) by six wickets\n\nDurham Dynamos were the team to beat in 2005, and up to this game they had only lost two of 17 League and Championship games. Meanwhile, Derbyshire Phantoms had only won two from 14. Nevertheless, the Phantoms recorded a comparatively easy victory, as Durham's weak batting line-up was exposed. Batting first, they only made 130 for 7, Kevin Dean taking two for 20 and Andre Botha two for 16, both from a full quota of four overs. Gordon Muchall was the only batsman to pass 20 for the Dynamos. In reply, James Bryant top-scored with a calm 53 not out off 46 balls, Jonathan Moss slashed boundaries at will in his 46, and two fours and a two from Botha sent them to 134 for 4 with 14 balls to spare with only Nathan Astle in some control for Durham, taking two for 14.\n\nLancashire (2pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nPhil Jaques, an Australian, was the dominant figure for the Yorkshire Phoenix in the Roses battle, scoring 72 from number three before being out to countryman Brad Hodge. That lifted the hosts to 165 for 7, but that was not enough to defend. Matthew Hoggard, the England Test bowler, showed an uncanny knack of being uneconomical, conceding 65 runs in his four overs, and despite two wickets he lost the game for the Phoenix. Brad Hodge ended with 64 not out for the visiting Lancashire Lightning as they won with seventeen balls to spare.\n\nSurrey (2pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by 23 runs\n\nSurrey Lions recorded their second win from two matches in Twenty20 Cup cricket this season, ironic given their position at the very bottom of the 45-over National League. Ali Brown made 64 and David Thornely 67 not out as Middlesex Crusaders conceded too many runs at the fine batting track at Lord's, Surrey making 200 for 3. Owais Shah notched up his second score in the 70s in two days, taking 78 from 44 balls, and things looked good despite Shah leaving at 148 for 2. But Tim Murtagh changed all that. In four overs, he took six for 24, and with the help of David Thornely (three for 22) he ensured that Middlesex had seven batsmen out in single figures. They were bowled out for 177, with three balls remaining in the innings.\n\nEssex (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by 29 runs\n\nThe match at Chelmsford was made into even more of a slog-effort by the English rain, as both sides were limited to 12 overs. Andy Flower made 46 off 29 balls, and 17 extras made the Essex Eagles run-rate exactly eleven an over. Defending 133, Essex got off to a good start as Antonio Palladino took two wickets, which stopped the visitors from massive smashing, and Kent Spitfires finished on 103 for 4 – thirty runs short of their winning target.\n\nNo result; Hampshire (1pt), Sussex (1pt)\n\nRain caused the match between Hampshire Hawks and Sussex Sharks to be abandoned. Despite the fact that a ball was not bowled, the match was declared a no-result since a toss was made.\n\nSomerset (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 15 runs\n\nDespite captain Graeme Smith becoming victim of Zander de Bruyn's bowling for just two runs, Somerset Sabres still posted a big target, thanks to Matthew Wood, who made 94 off only 35 balls before falling to Nadeem Malik six short of a century. Wood's smashing helped the Sabres to 210 for 6, although no other batsman passed 30. Graeme Hick tried to emulate Wood, but could only make 87 before Ian Blackwell got the better of him, and from then on Worcestershire never really had a chance. Blackwell finished with two for 20 in his four overs, and could take his share of the honour for Somerset's surprising win.\n\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by seven wickets\n\nGlamorgan Dragons were out of luck at Bristol, as their top order collapsed to the bowling of Carl Greenidge. Only a last-wicket partnership between Robert Croft and Dean Cosker ensured that Glamorgan batted out 20 overs, as they were 70 for 8 at one point but finished on 128 for 9. However, it was never enough. Croft took two wickets with his off-spin, but Craig Spearman's 39 built the platform as Gloucestershire Steelbacks eased to victory with 17 balls to spare.\n\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by 38 runs\n\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks took their second victory from two Twenty20 Cup matches thus far, as they accumulated 143 for 5 in 14 overs, despite no batsman hitting more than 40 in a rain-shortened match at Northampton. Scotsman Dougie Brown took one for nine off three overs for Warwickshire Bears, but the target was too large for the visitors, as Northamptonshire bowler Ben Phillips removed four Warwickshire lower-order batsmen – his second four-wicket-haul in three days – as the Bears crumbled to 105 for 9.\n\nNottinghamshire (2pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by 92 runs\n\nNottinghamshire Outlaws plundered runs off the Lancashire Lightning fast bowlers at Trent Bridge, to recover from their first-game loss to Leicestershire. Both James Anderson and Glen Chapple were taken for 53 in four overs each, as the Outlaws made 198 for 5. In reply, only Steven Crook passed 20 for Lancashire, Graeme Swann took three for 32 and Mark Ealham two for 22, and Lancashire ended up with an inadequate 106 all out.\n\nDerbyshire (2pts) beat Leicestershire (0pts) by seven wickets (D/L method)\n\nDerbyshire Phantoms beat last year's champions Leicestershire Foxes at The County Ground, Derby to be the only side with two victories in the North Division of the Twenty20 Cup. Bowling first turned out to be a stroke of genius, as the Leicestershire batsmen were tied down by Ian Hunter (three for 32) and Andre Botha (two for 19), and wickets were spread out as Leicestershire's last man, Claude Henderson, was caught on the last ball – all out for 137. Derbyshire's reply was shortened by rain, and they only got 14 overs to hit 103, and two wickets from David Masters set them back to 44 for 3. However, 42 from Luke Sutton ensured that Derbyshire made it to the target with seven balls to spare.\n\nMiddlesex (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by 20 runs\n\nEd Smith took over the mantle from Owais Shah as Middlesex Crusaders' most useful batsman in the Twenty20 Cup, as he recorded three sixes in a 59-ball 85 and lifted Middlesex to 189 for 8 against Kent Spitfires at Beckenham. In reply, Kent lost wickets regularly, and Justin Kemp – normally a quick scorer – couldn't find his footing and only made 23 not out off 19 balls, as Kent could only scamper 169 for 5 in their allotted 20 overs, 21 runs short of the target.\n\nHampshire (2pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by three wickets\n\nJames Bruce and Richard Logan, Hampshire Hawks' new-ball bowlers, reduced Surrey Lions to pieces at the Oval. Only Rikki Clarke passed 12 runs for Surrey, and he did so in style, making 52 with six fours and a six, while Logan and Bruce shared seven wickets between them. Hampshire had reason to be happy with bowling Surrey out for 118, although they did concede 17 wides, as extras were the second highest scorer for Surrey. Hampshire then attempted to collapse of their own, crashing to 6 for 2 and 66 for 7, but 34 from off-spinner and captain Shaun Udal saw them home without any further loss of wickets.\n\nEssex (2pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by 43 runs\n\nAfter Johannes van der Wath had given Sussex Sharks the edge with two early wickets against Essex Eagles, Andy Flower and Ryan ten Doeschate rebuilt to send the hosts to 151 for 5 after their 20 overs. Sussex, however, imploded following the departure of Chris Adams for 44, as Grant Flower took three quick wickets, and James Middlebrook and Andre Adams mopped up the tail for just 108.\n\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 54 runs\n\nWarwickshire Bears won their first Twenty20 match of the season in style, the deep batting line-up finally paying off. Almost every batsman contributed in their massive 205 for 7, Jamie Troughton top-scoring with 42, and no Glamorgan Dragons bowler escaped their wrath. When the Dragons batted, only Matthew Elliott and Sourav Ganguly gave them any hope of winning, and Ganguly's 36 off 35 balls was verging on the point of being useless when the required rate was 10 an over. A disciplined Warwickshire fielding effort – the Bears only conceded one extra – and Alex Loudon taking five for 33, resulted in Glamorgan falling to 151 all out in 18.2 overs.\n\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nThis was a game of two batsmen. After Steve Kirby had ripped out two Worcestershire Royals wickets early on, to finish with figures of two for 15 from four overs, the Royals had been 24 for 3. Zander de Bruyn then hit eight fours and three sixes in his 76 not out, lifting the Royals to 162 for 6 and setting a potentially tricky target. However, Phil Weston replied with 73 not out of his own, and despite only Craig Spearman passing 20 of the other batsmen, Weston secured a win for Gloucestershire with two balls to spare.\n\nYorkshire (2pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by two wickets\n\nTim Bresnan's onslaught of fast bowling resulted in three quick wickets for Yorkshire Phoenix, yet he was only called upon to bowl three overs – for 22 runs – and Nottinghamshire Outlaws were let off the hook. Chris Read top-scored with 43 off 35, propelling the hosts to 170 for 8. An excellent start by Ian Harvey and Michael Lumb sent Yorkshire to 60 for 1, as Harvey found boundaries seemingly at will – when he was out for 74 (with 64 of them in boundaries), however, Yorkshire imploded from 121 for 2 to 135 for 6. Craig White and Ismail Dawood fought back, and number 10 Richard Dawson won them the match with a two and a four, as Yorkshire needed four runs from the last three deliveries of the game.\n\nLeicestershire (2pts) beat Durham (0pts) by three runs\n\nDurham Dynamos contrived to lose this one, having first had Leicestershire Foxes on the rack after limiting them to a total of 150 for 9. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made that possible, but he was later to be the main culprit as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets and refused to give him runs. He eventually finished on 18 from 17 balls, making the task of Gareth Breese and Gordon Muchall impossible – and Durham finished an agonising three runs short.\n\nHampshire (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by five wickets\n\nZimbabwean Greg Lamb, playing for the Hampshire Hawks as a home qualified player due to owning an English passport, took four wickets, including three former Test players, for 28 – which helped peg Kent Spitfires back to 154 for 9. Hampshire's reply was very well timed, and even a good bowling spell from Kent's James Tredwell – who only conceded sixteen runs off the bat in four overs – could not stop the Hawks. Lawrence Prittipaul made 35 before being out on the penultimate ball with the scores tied, but off-spinner and stand-in captain Shaun Udal, however, made a single on the last ball, as Hampshire reached 155 for 5 in their 20 overs – Nic Pothas top-scoring with 58.\n\nSurrey (2pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by 22 runs (D/L method)\n\nRikki Clarke top-scored with 46 and top-bowled with three for 11 for the Surrey Lions as they moved closer to a quarter-final spot in the Twenty20 Cup with a Duckworth–Lewis method win over Middlesex Crusaders. Batting first, Surrey made 180 for 7, Tim Murtagh hitting 24 off the last eight balls as Melvyn Betts of Middlesex was smashed around. In reply, only Ed Smith could do anything serious against the Surrey bowlers, with 33 off 22 balls. When Clarke dug out him, Scott Styris and Ed Joyce in quick succession, however, things looked bright for Surrey, and then rain intervened after 11 overs of the Middlesex innings. They were never allowed to come back, and as they were 22 runs behind the par score with their 78 for 4, Surrey took the victory.\n\nMatch abandoned; Hampshire (1pt), Essex (1pt)\n\nHampshire Hawks and Essex Eagles shared the spoils as the match at The Rose Bowl, Southampton never got underway.\n\nSomerset (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 89 runs\n\nJames Hildreth smashed 71 runs off 37 balls to lift Somerset Sabres to a convincing victory at Taunton. Along with Keith Parsons making 57 off 28, they made a dent in the theory that spinners are useful in Twenty20 cricket, as experienced off-spinner Robert Croft was dispatched for 50 runs in four overs. The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four. The visitors' reply never really got going, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.\n\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 37 runs\n\nDavid Sales (59 runs) and Usman Afzaal (46) lifted Northamptonshire Steelbacks to a very competitive total of 180 for 6 at New Road, where Shoaib Akhtar bowled a maiden over but was smashed for thirty-three runs in the other three overs he bowled. The hosts' innings saw Worcestershire Royals lose Graeme Hick early on, and despite 53 from Stephen Moore, Northamptonshire's bowlers had a good grip on the Worcestershire players – Johann Louw got the best figures for the Steelbacks with three for 25 – and Worcestershire finished on 143 for 8.\n\nNo result; Gloucestershire (1pt), Warwickshire (1pt)\n\n37 balls were delivered before Gloucestershire Steelbacks and Warwickshire Bears were forced to abandon the game at The County Ground, Bristol due to rain. Warwickshire were 44 for 1 after 10 leg-byes and 16 not out from Nick Knight when the game was stopped.\n\nLancashire (2pts) beat Leicestershire (0pts) by eight wickets\n\nHD Ackerman was the only one who resisted a patient bowling display from Lancashire Lightning at their home ground, Old Trafford. Muttiah Muralitharan, the Sri Lankan off-spinner, took four for 19 in four overs, yet Ackerman made 79 not out amid the carnage, lifting Leicestershire Foxes to 146 for 7. However, Stuart Law took matters into his own hands, bludgeoning twelve fours and four sixes on his way to 92 not out – the highest score of the season so far – and Lancashire won with four wickets and 23 deliveries to spare.\n\nYorkshire (2pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by six wickets\n\nA high-scoring game at Headingley saw both sides score at run-rates in excess of 9. Derbyshire Phantoms batted first, with Jonathan Moss notching up 83 off just 44 balls – that's nearly two runs from every ball – and England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard was hit for 45 runs in three overs. Tim Bresnan, however, continued to like the short format, as he took three for 26 in four overs. In reply, Yorkshire Phoenix reaped the benefits of a massive partnership between Australians Ian Harvey (who made 109, the first Twenty20 century of the season) and Phil Jaques who shared a 124-run stand for the second wicket. Michael Lumb and Bresnan then kept the run rate up, and Yorkshire reached 198 for 4 with an over left in the game to clinch victory.\n\nDurham (2pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by six wickets\n\nDurham Dynamos got back on track with a closely fought six-wicket win at Riverside. Mark Ealham had some fun with Durham bowler Neil Killeen as he thumped six sixes in a 17-ball 45, and his partnership with Chris Read threatened to lift Nottinghamshire Outlaws to a much bigger score than their final 179. However, four wickets from Jamaican-born Gareth Breese helped stem the tide. In reply, Nathan Astle and Gordon Muchall both made 64 – the latter a not out – and Ealham was smashed about, conceding 51 runs in four overs. It was almost as bad for Andrew Harris, who conceded 38 off 15 legitimate deliveries as Durham won with three balls to spare.\n\nNo result; Essex (1pt), Hampshire (1pt)\n\nHampshire Hawks endured their second no-result in two days against Essex Eagles, having batted to a competitive total of 151 for 9 in their 20 overs, with Greg Lamb making 67. However, the Essex innings never got off, due to rain.\n\nMiddlesex (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by six wickets\n\nAt Uxbridge, Middlesex Crusaders proved the worth of wicket-taking bowling. Irfan Pathan dug out Matthew Walker with the second ball of the game, and that set the tone of the innings. Left-arm spinner Chris Peploe took three wickets, but conceded 35 runs, yet Kent's final total of 144 for 8 did not look too threatening. Owais Shah kept ploughing on his hard-hitting form, taking James Tredwell to the cleaners in his 59 not out, and Middlesex made it to 145 for 4 with 16 balls remaining in the innings, as none of the opposition bowlers took more than one wicket.\n\nSurrey (2pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by 5 wickets (D/L method)\n\nA close, rain-damaged match at The County Ground, Hove eventually ended in Surrey Lions snaring a last-ball victory over Sussex Sharks. Batting first, the hosts made 139 for 6 in 17 overs, spinner Nayan Doshi taking three wickets despite being the most expensive of the bowlers, while Matt Prior top-scored with 51. A 28-ball fifty from Ali Brown then lifted Surrey to 74 for 1, but two run outs saw them lose their next four wickets for eight runs. Azhar Mahmood and Ian Salisbury, however, shared a 36-run partnership and saw them pass the revised target of 114 by two runs on the very last ball of the game.\n\nSomerset (2pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nAt Northampton, Andy Caddick served up an unusually economical spell, taking two for 12 in three overs despite two wides. That helped tie the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks down to 95 for 6 in 12 overs in the rain-shortened game, and with Graeme Smith and Keith Parsons at the crease and the score 55 for 1, things looked bright for Somerset Sabres. Two wickets from Jason Brown helped put the odds for a Northamptonshire win down, but Somerset prevailed, Parsons hitting the winning runs on the last ball as Somerset finished on 97 for 5.\n\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by four runs\n\nGlamorgan Dragons continued their poor form in an eventful game at Edgbaston. Jamie Troughton's 51 rescued Warwickshire Bears from a potentially tricky situation at 56 for 4, and quick hitting from Dougie Brown along with eleven extras gave the hosts a total of 169 for 9. Glamorgan started well, with Sourav Ganguly and Matthew Elliott lifting them to 88 for 1 before leaving in quick succession to Neil Carter and Jonathan Trott respectively. Michael Powell and David Hemp then built another big partnership of 59 to see Glamorgan 147 for 3, but Carter and Brown then shared five wickets as Glamorgan's lower middle order fell apart. Powell tried to pair up with Dean Cosker, but the damage was already done, and Powell was run out on the penultimate ball as they needed six runs from two balls.\n\nLancashire (2pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by 66 runs\n\nBrad Hodge and 23 wides gave Lancashire Lightning a competitive total against Derbyshire Phantoms, making 164 for 8 despite Kevin Dean's spell of one for 16 from four overs. Hodge made 44 off 34 balls, and Dominic Cork – promoted to five – made 28, the only ones to pass 20. Hodge, who came on as fourth change bowler, fuelled the Derbyshire implosion with wickets, as they couldn't hit the ball off the square and were all out for 98 – Hodge ending with figures of four for 17.\n\nLeicestershire (2pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by 21 runs\n\nLeicestershire Foxes took the win at Trent Bridge in a low-scoring match. Nottinghamshire Outlaws had won the toss and bowled first, and ought to have been pretty pleased with restricting the Foxes to 150 for 4, even though they conceded 15 extras. The opening partnership of HD Ackerman and Darren Maddy for 67 runs had promised more for Leicestershire. However, West Indian Ottis Gibson dug out two early wickets in Graeme Swann and Stephen Fleming – Darren Maddy and David Masters then took wickets at leisure, and Nottinghamshire were 96 for 7. Despite a rescue mission from Gareth Clough who hit 30 off 16 balls, there was no hitting power from the other players, and Nottinghamshire finished on 129 for 8.\n\nDurham (2pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by two wickets\n\nDurham Dynamos won a low-scoring game at Headingley as both these sides looked to wave goodbye to a quarter-final spot. Yorkshire Phoenix were sent in to bat, but struggled to score runs, falling to 12 for three early on. Durham captain Dale Benkenstein bowled himself for two overs to take three wickets for 10, and that spell set Yorkshire back sufficiently to limit them to 123 for 7 – despite a total of 10 extras. Matthew Hoggard and Tim Bresnan then took three quick wickets between them to reduce Durham to 15 for 3, but despite eight wickets falling in the Durham innings, Phil Mustard's 31 and an identical score from No. 8 Gary Scott was enough to lift them to 124 for 8 with an over remaining.\n\nMiddlesex (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by 31 runs\n\nMiddlesex Crusaders defeated Essex Eagles despite missing Irish batsman Ed Joyce, who had gone off to play in the 2005 ICC Trophy. An opening partnership between Owais Shah and Ed Smith for 100 built the platform, Shah eventually making 79, and despite three wickets from Essex off-spinner James Middlebrook, Irfan Pathan smashed two sixes in his 21 to lift Middlesex to 185 for 6. Then Pathan took three quick wickets, those of Alastair Cook, Ronnie Irani and Ravinder Bopara, as Essex crashed to 45 for 5. James Foster made 62 not out to rescue Essex' honour somewhat, but the final score – 154 for 7 – was well short. Pathan got another wicket near the end to finish with four for 27.\n\nSurrey (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by 23 runs (D/L method)\n\nKent Spitfires suffered another loss, this time at the Oval against Surrey Lions. In a rain-hit game shortened by five overs, Surrey scored freely, hitting at nearly 11 runs an over – Ali Brown with 29 and Scott Newman with 52 not out off 27 balls doing the brunt of the damage. Kent made an attempt at chasing 168, with Michael Carberry taking 23 runs off nine balls in his innings from number three, but Surrey spinner Nayan Doshi took four wickets for 27 to set them back to 123 for 6. With economical bowling from Azhar Mahmood as well, Kent only managed 144 for 8.\n\nSussex (2pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 10 runs\n\nA twelve-over game at Hove was won by Sussex Sharks, though the rain threatened to destroy it all. IanWard and Matt Prior opened the batting for Sussex, who had been sent in to bat by Hampshire Hawks' captain Shaun Udal, and they made good use of it, sending Sussex to 53 for 0. Two quick wickets from Sean Ervine slowed the Sharks' progression, as they slumped to 88 for 5, but Michael Yardy hit 10 in four balls in an unbeaten 11-run sixth-wicket stand with Carl Hopkinson. Chasing, Hampshire never quite kept up with the required run rate, as Mushtaq Ahmed took three for 19 in his three overs to be the main cause of the Hawks' demise, and Hampshire finished on 89 for 6.\n\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled; Glamorgan (1pt), Northamptonshire (1pt)\n\nThe weather at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff prevented a match from getting underway between Glamorgan Dragons and Northamptonshire Steelbacks.\n\nNo result; Gloucestershire (1pt), Somerset (1pt)\n\nOnly thirteen overs of play was possible at The County Ground, Bristol. By that time, two Somerset Sabres batsmen had departed for golden ducks – Graeme Smith and James Hildreth – and Somerset were 61 for 7. Gloucestershire Gladiators would have fancied their chances, but rain intervened to spoil the party.\n(Cricinfo scorecard\n\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one run\n\nWorcestershire Royals took their second successive one-run victory over Warwickshire Bears, to the agony of home fans at Edgbaston. After Heath Streak took two early wickets, Neil Carter entered the scene as the sixth bowler to be used. He took five wickets inside four overs, for 19 runs, as Worcestershire were all out for 141 with seven balls to spare. In reply, two run-outs and wickets from Gareth Batty and Zander de Bruyn left Warwickshire trailing by 60 with one wicket in hand, with Heath Streak and James Anyon at the crease. Streak rotated the strike well, facing most of the balls and hitting most of the runs, and brought the score to 140 for 9 with a ball to spare. Then – setting off for the last run that would tie the scores (and win the match for Warwickshire on fewer wickets lost) – Streak was run out for 59, off 32 balls, and Warwickshire's quarter-final hopes were dented, but not wiped out.\n\nLeicestershire (2pts) beat Durham (0pts) by 32 runs\n\nLast year's champions Leicestershire Foxes were back on track for the quarter-finals thanks to 73 from John Sadler at the Riverside Ground. Sadler's 72-run second-wicket partnership with skipper HD Ackerman lifted the visitors to 154 for 7. Durham Dynamos yet again showed their inability to hit at anything significantly above 6 an over, Nicky Peng's top-score of 37 being off 41 balls. Despite captain Dale Benkenstein hitting 33 not out off 16 deliveries, it did not help, as Leicestershire smothered them to 122 for 7.\n\nLancashire (2pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by 110 runs\n\nLancashire Lightning recorded the most emphatic victory by runs in the 2005 Twenty20 season, as they had fun with the Yorkshire Phoenix bowlers. After being put in to bat, Mal Loye and Stuart Law put on 106 for the first wicket, and when Loye departed for 47 Brad Hodge followed up with a 17-ball 33, a partnership of 77 with Law. Despite Ian Harvey digging into them with two wickets, the early run-rate ensured that Lancashire set a target of 208, Law recording the second Twenty20 century this season – in 56 balls. Ian Harvey, the man responsible for the first of those centuries, was out early for 1, and wickets fell to everyone as Yorkshire were out for 97 – Dominic Cork taking three for 10, Muttiah Muralitharan three for 17, and James Anderson two for 26. Matthew Hoggard and Tim Bresnan recorded the highest partnership for Yorkshire, with 22 for the tenth wicket.\n\nDerbyshire (2pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by four wickets\n\nDerbyshire Phantoms needed to win to have a chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals – and did it, in a thriller finish. Nottinghamshire Outlaws batted first, and Will Smith and Chris Read made 51 and 44 not out respectively. The pair where the only two Nottinghamshire batsmen to pass 20, their contributions lifted the hosts to 147 for 8. Michael Di Venuto and Luke Sutton took Derbyshire to 92 for 1 before economical bowling chipped away at Derbyshire's batting. However, captain Sutton kept a cool head, anchoring the chase with 61 not out in 54 balls as Derbyshire won with two balls to spare.\n\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by five wickets\n\nDespite Graeme Smith making a 53-ball century, and pairing up with Matthew Wood for 129 for the first wicket, Somerset Sabres still lost the match at Taunton. Smith's 105 helped Somerset set a target of 190, but none of the bowlers conceded less than seven an over to Northamptonshire Steelbacks' batting. Simon Francis was the worst, ending with 57 conceded runs in four overs, while Riki Wessels hit 49 not out with four sixes off 22 balls, and the Sabres had to see that Northamptonshire won with an over to spare.\n\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by nine wickets\n\nThe visitors Gloucestershire Gladiators recorded an easy victory at New Road as Worcestershire scored only 100 all out in their innings, Stephen Moore top-scoring with only 23. Martyn Ball took three for 24, but all the bowlers got wickets, and Mark Alleyne conceded only six runs in four overs. Although they lost Craig Spearman with the score on 22, the Gladiators knocked off their target easily, with nine wickets and five overs to spare.\n\nLancashire (2pts) beat Durham (0pts) by 37 runs\n\nMal Loye and Brad Hodge helped Lancashire Lightning to recover after Stuart Law was stumped in the second over off Durham Dynamos medium-pacer Neil Killeen. Loye and Hodge paired up for 169 for the second wicket, as Loye became the second Lancastrian to score a Twenty20 century this season before he was eventually caught off Nathan Astle's bowling for 100. Lancashire closed on 208 for 4, and only Killeen conceded less than 30 runs of Durham's six bowlers. Astle got the best bowling figures, with two for 37, but his batting helped little – 55 for 37 was never enough to keep up with the asking rate of 10.5. When Durham realised that, they tried to lash out, and a result, wickets tumbled to Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork and Durham finished their 20 overs with the score on 171 for 7.\n\nNottinghamshire (2pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by six wickets\n\nNottinghamshire won the toss at Headingley and put Yorkshire into bat. The hosts suffered an immediate setback when Ian Harvey was out from the first ball to Andrew Harris, but Craig White and Phil Jaques settled the ship, with Jaques going on to score 55 off 33 balls. Richard Pyrah finished the innings with 31 off 17 as Yorkshire set their guests a target of 181 to win. The start of Nottinghamshire's innings was the opposite to Yorkshire's: openers Will Smith (55) and Graeme Swann (62) put on 101 before they were parted, as Swann slashed nine fours, three sixes, and also had time to run eight times across the pitch in a 25-ball frenzy. Yorkshire took the next four wickets for 50 runs, with leg spinner Mark Lawson grabbing two, and with a high total to chase the game was in the balance. However, Chris Read's 28 off 18 balls saw Nottinghamshire home with just two balls to go. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nLancashire (2pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by 50 runs (D/L method)\n\nBig scores from Stuart Law (67) and Brad Hodge (90 not out) helped Lancashire Lightning to a massive 205 for 2 at The County Ground, Derby, medium-pacer Ian Hunter taking both wickets. Law and Hodge shared a 154-run stand for the second wicket. Two early wickets from former England ODI player James Anderson pegged Derbyshire Phantoms back, and Brad Hodge took four for 27 – his second Twenty20 four-wicket-haul of the season – to reduce Derbyshire to 106 for 7, before rain intervened with 5.3 overs left in the game. The rain never relented, and it was calculated that Derbyshire's par score was 156, thus Lancashire took a convincing 50-run victory. The victory meant that Lancashire qualified for the quarter-finals with one game to spare.\n\nYorkshire (2pts) beat Durham (0pts) by 40 runs\n\nYorkshire Phoenix got their first win in three Twenty20 games, but the quarter-finals still looked out of sight, as they needed to win their last game and Derbyshire lose their last. Batting first, Ian Harvey, Craig White and Paul Jaques all made scores between 40 and 60, to lift Yorkshire to 126 for 1 at one point. Off-spinner Gary Scott and medium-pacer Dale Benkenstein took three wickets between them, but Yorkshire still managed 171 for 7. Durham Dynamos looked in the game when Benkenstein and Gordon Muchall were at the crease, pairing up for 79 for the fourth wicket, but a burst of wickets – thanks to Richard Dawson and Anthony McGrath's bowling – sent Durham to the ropes at 111 for 8. Twelve minutes later, it was all over for 131, with 17 deliveries remaining. Yorkshire's 30-year-old seam bowler Adam Warren took two for 32 on Twenty20 debut.\n\nNo result; Sussex (1pt), Middlesex (1pt)\n\nSeven overs of play was possible at The County Ground, Hove, before rain intervened. Owais Shah made 30 not out off 20 balls to see Middlesex Crusaders to a healthy 56 for 1, but Sussex Sharks never got the chance to chase as the game was abandoned.\n\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 47 runs\n\nWarwickshire Bears jumped on the quarter-final train just as it seemed to be leaving the station, grabbing the ticket out of the hands of Somerset Sabres. Neil Carter and Ian Bell opened the batting and scored quickly, sending the score to 40 for 1, but part-timer William Durston got three wickets in quick succession to have three for four at one point. Trevor Penney then smashed three successive sixes off Durston to end with 35 not out off 13 balls. Thus, Warwickshire closed on 172 for 8, and patient bowling from Carter and Alex Loudon sent them crumbling to 89 for 6. Arul Suppiah and Durston paired up for 27 for the seventh wicket, but when Suppiah was bowled by Jonathan Trott it looked hopeless for Somerset. Jamie Anyon wrapped them up with a hat-trick to end Somerset's innings on 125.\n\nEssex (2pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by one run\n\nRain ravaged The County Ground, Chelmsford and delayed the match between Essex Eagles and Surrey Lions to after ten o'clock. When it finally began, it had been shortened to five overs a side, and Essex made good use of it as they scored 71 for 3 – Ronnie Irani making 32, while Azhar Mahmood took two for three for Surrey. In reply, Antonio Palladino took two wickets for Essex, but it looked up for grabs when Surrey needed eight off five after James Middlebrook bowled a wide that went for four – however, he only conceded six runs from the remaining balls of the game, and Surrey finished on 70 for 2. Yet, they would have to be exceedingly unlucky in their last game to be eliminated, while Essex jumped into the top three and looked to qualify along with them.\n\nNo result; Kent (1pt), Sussex (1pt)\n\nIn eleven overs of play, Kent Spitfires moved to 91 for 1, Andrew Hall making 43 not out as Sussex Sharks' new man, Pakistani Naved-ul-Hasan made his debut with nought for 10 in two overs. Then, rain made play impossible.\n\nGlamorgan (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by ten wickets\n\nGlamorgan Dragons broke their streak of four successive losses with a comfortable victory at Sophia Gardins. The two brothers David Harrison and Adam Harrison took two wickets each for Glamorgan, as Gloucestershire Gladiators crumbled to 57 for 7. Jon Lewis and Mark Alleyne shared a 68-run stand, but a quick burst of wickets from Robert Croft and Andrew Davies had them all out for 128 at Sophia Gardens. Croft and Matthew Elliott both made fifties as Glamorgan Dragons knocked off the runs with ten wickets and 7.3 overs to spare, helped by five no-balls and four wides from the Gloucestershire bowlers.\n\nMatch abandoned; Leicestershire (1pt), Derbyshire (1pt)\n\nNo play was possible at Grace Road due to rain, but Leicestershire Foxes moved one step closer to the second place that guaranteed a quarter-final – the no-result meant that they were still two points ahead of Derbyshire Phantoms in third place, and dominating on net run-rate.\n\nMatch abandoned; Northamptonshire (1pt), Worcestershire (1pt)\n\nNo play was possible at The County Ground, Northampton due to rain, and the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks qualified for the quarter-finals thanks to the no-result.\n\nKent (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by five runs\n\nDane Amjad Khan, who had missed the first part of the 2005 ICC Trophy and most of the Twenty20 Cup due to injury, returned to cricket with a very decent bowling spell of three for 24 to set Essex Eagles back to 26 for 3. Khan's Kent Spitfires had batted first, however, and 59 not out from left-hander Michael Carberry lifted them to a total of 154 for 4, while Andre Adams shone on the bowling front for Essex with two for 12 off three overs. However, the Spitfires kept firing dangerous balls at the Eagles, and eventually shot them down to 149 for 7 – Mark Pettini making 60 in vain before he was run out, while Andrew Hall took two for 30 for Kent.\n\nHampshire (2pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by six wickets\n\nIn a high-scoring match at Richmond, Middlesex Crusaders made 174 for 7 having opted to bat first. Owais Shah made yet another fifty – his fifth in eight innings – while Scott Styris and Paul Weekes made quick scores to up the run-rate. Shaun Udal, Sean Ervine and Craig McMillan all got two wickets. Hampshire Hawks started slowly, at about seven an over, but McMillan took a liking to Chris Peploe in particular as he smashed five sixes in his half-hour 65 not out, and thanks to McMillan's big hitting Hampshire won with sixteen balls and six wickets to spare. However, it was in vain – with only three wins, they finished fourth in the South Division tables, while Middlesex qualified despite having a poorer net run rate than Hampshire.\n\nSussex (2pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by three wickets\n\nSurrey Lions were consistently pegged back by the Sussex Sharks' bowling at The Oval, having been put in to bat by Sussex captain Chris Adams. Azhar Mahmood stood firm and knocked off 40 unbeaten runs, but Naved-ul-Hasan, James Kirtley and Mushtaq Ahmed all got two wickets for less than six runs an over as Surrey eventually had to settle for 144 for 8. In reply, IanWard made a quickfire 50, off 28 balls, before being bowled by Surrey off-spinner Nayan Doshi to send Sussex to 82 for 3. Adams and Murray Goodwin both made 28, while Azhar Mahmood took two for 21 from four overs. Eventually, a six from Naved-ul-Hasan won Sussex the game with three balls to spare to put them third in the table, but as they were the poorest third-placed side in the competition with only three wins, they were still knocked out.\n\nSomerset (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 95 runs\n\nSomerset Sabres made it through to the quarter-finals after recording a massive score of 228 for 5 in twenty overs – the highest team total in Twenty20 Cup history, eclipsing a record set a couple of weeks earlier. The most economical bowler was Steve Kirby, and he conceded 35 runs in four overs, while the other four where all taken for more than 40 runs. Graeme Smith top-scored with 53, Ian Blackwell made 45, and James Hildreth recorded 32 off 10 balls – 28 from six shots to the boundary and four from the other four deliveries. Somerset's innings featured eight sixes and twenty extras. Gloucestershire Gladiators, who were second in the Midland/Wales/West group before this game at Taunton, had to go for expansive strokes, and were all out in sixteen overs, Gareth Andrew taking four for 22 while Craig Spearman top scored with 35 off 17 balls. Keith Parsons also contributed bowling-wise, taking three for 12.\n\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 41 runs\n\nWarwickshire Bears were lifted to a total of 205 for 2 by hitting eight sixes at Edgbaston, Ian Bell carrying his side with 66 not out off just 38 balls. Nick Knight also made 61 as Northamptonshire Steelbacks failed to make any impact with the ball. The Northamptonshire reply was stifled by some reasonably economical bowling, with no regular bowler conceding more than eight an over, and good fielding which yielded one run out and stopped the boundaries. Warwickshire seamer Jamie Anyon took three for 34, for his second successive match with a three-wicket haul, while Usman Afzaal became top scorer with a run-a-ball 43. Ben Phillips hit 41 not out from number four to complement his bowling figures of two for 43. In the end, Northamptonshire made 164 for 6, but still went through – along with Warwickshire, who finished second in their group thanks to their win over Somerset two days earlier.\n\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 37 runs\n\nBoth Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were knocked out before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from amassing one of the highest scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 – Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar – who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.\n\nDerbyshire (2pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by nine wickets\n\nNottinghamshire Outlaws were limited to 139 for 5 by economical Derbyshire Phantoms bowling – which allowed them to take singles and not much more at Derby. Only ten boundaries were hit during Nottinghamshire's innings, all in fours, and Chris Read – usually a man with a high strike-rate – was limited to 29 off 31 balls. The Derbyshire reply was spearheaded by Michael Di Venuto who made an unbeaten 77 and added 92 with Jonathan Moss for the second wicket. Derbyshire passed their target with nine wickets and 20 balls in hand, and the victory gave them a quarter-final berth.\n\nMatch abandoned; Durham (1pt), Lancashire (1pt)\n\nAs Lancashire Lightning were already through and Durham Dynamos already knocked out of the Twenty20 Cup, the rain at the Riverside Ground mattered little. Both sides shared a point in the game.\n\nLeicestershire (2pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by seven wickets\n\nWith a lot of luck with other results, Yorkshire Phoenix could have qualified for the quarter-finals with a win in this game against Leicestershire Foxes. However, as Ian Harvey's support batsmen failed to score at more than three an over until Anthony McGrath came in at five with the scoreboard on 84 for 3, their innings was eventually worth just 177 for 5 – Harvey making 77 of those and McGrath 33. In reply, opening batsman Darren Maddy anchored the innings with 72 not out, and Jeremy Snape saw off the required runs as he hit 39 off 23 balls and the Foxes won with nine balls and seven wickets to spare. Leicestershire, who needed a tie or better to be completely assured of the quarter-final spot, thus went through.\n\nTie-breaker rules:\n\n\nLancashire beat Derbyshire by 17 runs to progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\n\nAfter Mal Loye's boundary-filled 73, off just 32 balls, Derbyshire Phantoms were probably happy that they escaped with conceding 189 runs in their game with Lancashire Lightning at Old Trafford. Lancashire tried to employ pinch hitters such as Dominic Cork and Glenn Chapple to get the runs flowing quickly, but they disappointed slightly, hitting at just over a run a ball. Derbyshire's chase looked possible despite Gary Keedy taking the wickets of Michael Di Venuto and Jonathan Moss, two danger men, early on – as they were 121 for 3 – but Keedy dug out another wicket, and that spurred a collapse to 139 for 8, part-time off-spinner Andrew Crook joining in with two for 35. Derbyshire needed some big hits from the specialist bowlers in the end, and crumbled to 172 with three balls remaining, James Anderson getting the honour of taking the last wicket.\n\nLeicestershire beat Middlesex by 19 runs to progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\n\nDefending champions Leicestershire Foxes reached their third successive appearances in the Twenty20 Cup semi-finals, after a fiery spell of bowling from South African Charl Willoughby helped them defend a potentially low target. Batting first, all the Leicestershire batsmen made reasonable contributions, but no one exceeded 40. With the help of 17 extras, Leicestershire finished on 159 for 6. However, Willoughby snared out three early wickets – finishing his spell of four overs with three for 11, including a rare maiden over – as Middlesex Crusaders crumbled to 16 for 3. When Jamie Dalrymple and Scott Styris threatened to win the game back with a partnership of 87, another South African, Claude Henderson rapped out two more wickets, and despite Styris being unbeaten on 73, Middlesex could only scamper 140 for 7.\n\nSomerset beat Northamptonshire by four wickets to progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\n\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks failed to take full use of their home advantage, and Somerset Sabres escaped with a four-wicket win to reach their first semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup. Northamptonshire's batsmen made quick scores between 20 and 30, but Ian Blackwell's spell mid-match of three for 16 pegged Northamptonshire back to 118 for 6. Ben Phillips then made an unbeaten 27 to lift his team to 154 for 8, however, but he couldn't take a wicket while bowling. Despite three run-outs, Somerset made it through on the penultimate ball, as Matthew Wood recorded 58 and Blackwell a 16-ball 31 to lay the foundation before Keith Parsons set the pace late on with an unbeaten 38.\n\nMatch tied (D/L Method); Surrey won 4–3 in a bowl-out and progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\n\nIn an incredible finish to the knock-out quarter-final between Surrey Lions and Warwickshire Bears, the match was tied, so the players had to resort to a bowl-off – cricket's version of a penalty shootout, in which five players have two attempts at bowling at unguarded stumps, and if the stumps fall down, that was one point for their team. Surrey opened the batting in this match at The Oval, having been put in to bat by the Bears' captain Nick Knight. It was a shaky effort, often interrupted by wickets, and part-timer Jonathan Trott snared two wickets for 19 – admittedly tail-enders Ian Salisbury and Tim Murtagh. Mark Ramprakash, however, hit an unbeaten run-a-ball 34 to guide Surrey to 149 for 8, well below a par score. Warwickshire's innings then began under heavy cloud cover that assisted the Surrey swing bowlers. After Neil Carter went first ball, Warwickshire struggled in the rain, and the bad weather eventually stopped play just before five overs was played – so that, if the players couldn't return, the match would be declared a no-result. However, the rain gave way reasonably quickly, and quick hitting from Trevor Penney in particular – who made 20 off 12 balls before being caught off a ball from Rikki Clarke closed down the deficit.\n\nWith five overs being cut off the Warwickshire chase, they needed 118 from 15 overs, and they had got to 115 for 8 with one ball remaining and Dewald Pretorius and an injured Heath Streak, who had not bowled, at the crease. The umpires consulted, and were uncertain about what would happen if Warwickshire scored two – which, in the event, happened. As the par scores under Duckworth-Lewis were level, the captains agreed to have a bowl-off (alternatively the umpires could have forced a bowl-off or decided the game on a toss of the coin). After five players had tried to get the stumps down, both teams had managed the feat twice, and now a sudden death style bowl-off followed. The next player from each side managed to get the stumps down once each, so the score was now 3–3, but Warwickshire's Heath Streak missed both his attempts and Tim Murtagh got the stumps down and won the match for the hosts by 4–3.\n\nOn 30 July, The Oval:\n\nLancashire won by 20 runs and qualified for the Twenty20 Cup final\n\nIn the first of two semi-finals at The Oval on the Twenty20 Cup finals day, Lancashire Lightning lived up to expectations by smashing 217 for 4 in twenty overs against Surrey Lions – well helped by eleven wides and six penalty runs, although Lancashire's top five all contributed. Only Nayan Doshi came away with some face on the bowling side, taking two for 35, but with Andrew Flintoff making 49 and Andrew Symonds an unbeaten 52 the target quickly reached dangerously high levels – from a Surrey perspective, anyway.\n\nAli Brown and James Benning started well with an opening partnership of 93, as Dominic Cork and James Anderson were taken for runs, but Benning, Scott Newman, Brown and Rikki Clarke fell in quick succession to see Surrey struggle at 104 for 4. Mark Ramprakash and Azhar Mahmood upped the ante again, but when Flintoff and Anderson broke through with one wicket each, and Surrey crumbled to 195 for 7.\n\nSomerset won by four runs and progress to the Twenty20 Cup final\n\nDefending champions Leicestershire Foxes failed to take care of an excellent position against Somerset Sabres, as the second semi-final became a low-scoring, yet thrilling affair. After Dinesh Mongia had taken three for 30 to set Somerset back to 139 for 7 after Graeme Smith (with 29), Matthew Wood (38) and Marcus Trescothick (25) had lifted them to 89 for 1 at one point during the innings. Carl Gazzard, Somerset's young wicketkeeper, made 26 to lift them to a final total of 157 for 9.\n\nIn reply, Darren Maddy and HD Ackerman lifted Leicestershire to 74 for no loss after eight overs, requiring \"only\" 83 from the last twelve. However, Ian Blackwell took three quick wickets to send Leicestershire to 90 for 3, Richard Johnson (figures of 3–0–21–3), Keith Parsons (3–0–15–0) and Wes Durston (3–0–18–1) bowled tightly to frustrate the Leicestershire batsmen, and despite a last-ball six from Paul Nixon, Somerset won by four runs and qualified for the final, where they would be facing Lancashire Lightning.\n\nOn 30 July, The Oval\n\nSomerset beat Lancashire by seven wickets and won the 2005 Twenty20 Cup\n\nSomerset Sabres completed their run by springing the final upset to beat Lancashire Lightning in the Twenty20 Cup final. It should perhaps have been renamed Sixteen16, because rain earlier in the day delayed the schedule and meant that the final had been shortened to 16 overs a side, while the semi-finals had both been 20 overs. However, Somerset did not mind – their strongest batsmen were their numbers one and two, Graeme Smith and Marcus Trescothick, and the more relative impact these two would have, the better for the Sabres. Their task was made easier, though, as Somerset fast bowler Andrew Caddick dug out a couple of early Lancashire wickets, which was followed a run-out and two wickets in two balls from Richard Johnson, as Lancashire crawled to 41 for 5.\n\nAustralian-born Stuart Law stood tall at the crease, defying the Somerset bowlers to make 59 before being run out on the very last ball, but Somerset only needed 115 from 16 overs – a run rate of 7.19. Smith and Trescothick started positively, before Trescothick's England team-mate Andrew Flintoff had him edge behind to Warren Hegg for 10. With two more wickets falling, Lancashire would perhaps have fancied their chances with the Somerset score on 65 for 3, but Smith defied them with an unbeaten 64, adding 53 in a fourth-wicket stand with young James Hildreth to guide Somerset to the target with seven wickets and eleven balls to spare.\n"}
{"id": "2019567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019567", "title": "Lübeck Airport", "text": "Lübeck Airport\n\nLübeck Airport is a minor German airport located south of Lübeck, the second-largest city in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, and northeast of Hamburg. Until all scheduled air traffic ceased on 15 April 2016, it was the secondary airport for the Hamburg Metropolitan Region, after the much bigger Hamburg Airport, and was used for low-cost and some occasional charter traffic. The airport was therefore sometimes called \"\"Hamburg Lübeck\"\" for marketing purposes.\n\nThe construction of the airport began in 1916 and was completed in 1917 when it started its operations as an airfield. At the end of World War I the airfield was shut down. In 1933 it was re-opened and extended by the Luftwaffe. During the Berlin Blockade after World War II, the Royal Air Force flew coal to Berlin and refugees to West Germany using Douglas DC-3 Dakota aircraft.\n\nAfter the re-unification of Germany, the airport started to grow slightly when several airlines started flying to Lübeck. In 1997, the arrival terminal was re-constructed and extended.\n\nRyanair started to operate from the airport in 2000 with the first flights to London-Stansted. Ryanair's route system expanded over the years until 2009. Wizz Air started operations in 2006 with flights to Gdańsk, and later other eastern European destinations. Discussions about Ryanair opening a base at the airport were held since 2009 without results.\n\nInfratil, an infrastructure investment company from New Zealand held a 90% shareholding from November 2005 until the end of October 2009, when it sold its shares back to the City of Lübeck. The new principal operator, Flughafen Lübeck GmbH, had been searching for an investor since then, when in 2013 the airport was sold to a private investor.\n\nIn 2010, both the financial crisis and the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull led to a general decrease in passenger numbers and destinations.\n\nA new ILS CAT II system went operational in February 2014, allowing planes to operate at the airport in more difficult weather conditions. As of March 2014 there were four lawsuits active against a further expansion of the airport.\n\nOn 23 April 2014 Lübeck Airport filed for bankruptcy. A few days earlier it had been reported that the owner, which bought the airport in 2013, had pulled out again. The airport continued to operate while the liquidator reviewed possible strategies. In July 2014, the bankrupt airport was sold to Chinese investor \"PuRen Germany GmbH\", a subsidiary of \"PuRen Group\".\n\nIn June 2014 Ryanair announced it would leave Lübeck Airport as of October 2014 due to the airport's uncertain future. Soon this date was revised to July 2014, when the year-round route to Bergamo as well as the seasonal services to Palma de Mallorca and Pisa ceased. Meanwhile, Ryanair announced it would start new routes from Hamburg Airport instead.\n\nIn September 2015, the airport's new owner, the German subsidiary of the Chinese \"PuRen Group\", also declared bankruptcy. The state of Schleswig-Holstein had already announced it would not invest in the airport. New investors were sought and operations would be maintained until further notice. As of January 2016, the selection process for a new owner of the airport was still ongoing.\n\nIn March 2016, Wizz Air announced that it would cease all operations to and from Lübeck by 15 April 2016, leaving the airport without any scheduled passenger services. The routes to Gdańsk, Kiev–Zhulyany and Skopje were relocated to Hamburg Airport, while the flights to Riga as well as the newly established route to Sofia ceased without replacement. The last scheduled commercial flight, a Wizz Air service to Sofia, left Lübeck at 20:05 local time on 15 April 2016.\n\nLübeck Airport features one small terminal building, containing check-in facilities, a shop and some restaurants. The apron features three stands for walk-boarding, which are suitable for mid-sized aircraft such as the Airbus A320, as well as some stands for smaller general aviation aircraft.\n\nAs of 16 April 2016, there are no commercial scheduled or charter flights at Lübeck Airport. The nearest major international airport is Hamburg Airport, approx. to the southwest.\nOn January 13, 2020, Lübeck Airport announced that scheduled flights to Stuttgart and Munich should be carried out from June 1, 2020. For this purpose, an ATR 72-600 will be purchased, which will be used with the painting \"Lübeck Air\" and carried out by Air Alsie. (www.aerotelegraph.com/das-sind-die-plaene-von-luebeck-air)\n\nLübeck Airport can be reached via motorways A1 which leads towards Hamburg and A20 which runs to the east through Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (exit \"Lübeck-Süd\").\n\nThe local bus line 6 runs every 30 minutes and connects the airport with Lübeck's main bus station (\"ZOB\"). A regional shuttle bus, line A20, runs from the airport to Hamburg's central train station, stopping at the central coach station \"ZOB\" nearby. The schedule of the A20 depends on the aircraft arriving in and departing from Lübeck.\n\nRegional trains run every hour between Kiel and Lüneburg, stopping at the airport's own station \"Lübeck-Flughafen\" as well as Lübeck main station. Connecting trains are available at Lübeck Hauptbahnhof or in Büchen to Hamburg and other destinations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2019576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019576", "title": "Education in Italy", "text": "Education in Italy\n\nEducation in Italy is compulsory from 6 to 16 years of age, and is divided into five stages: kindergarten (\"scuola dell'infanzia\"), primary school (\"scuola primaria\" or \"scuola elementare\"), lower secondary school (\"scuola secondaria di primo grado\" or \"scuola media inferiore\"), upper secondary school (\"scuola secondaria di secondo grado\" or \"scuola media superiore\") and university (\"università\"). Education is free in Italy and free education is available to children of all nationalities who are residents in Italy. Italy has both a private and public education system.\n\nIn Italy a state school system or Education System has existed since 1859, when the Legge Casati (Casati Act) mandated educational responsibilities for the forthcoming Italian state (Italian unification took place in 1861).\nThe Casati Act made primary education compulsory, and had the goal of increasing literacy. This law gave control of primary education to the single towns, of secondary education to the provinces, and the universities were managed by the State.\nEven with the Casati Act and compulsory education, in rural (and southern) areas children often were not sent to school (the rate of children enrolled in primary education would reach 90% only after 70 years) and the illiteracy rate (which was nearly 80% in 1861) took more than 50 years to halve.\n\nThe next important law concerning the Italian education system was the \"Legge Gentile\". This act was issued in 1923, thus when Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party were in power. In fact, Giovanni Gentile was appointed the task of creating an education system deemed fit for the fascist system. The compulsory age of education was raised to 14 years, and was somewhat based on a ladder system: after the first five years of primary education, one could choose the 'Scuola media', which would give further access to the \"liceo\" and other secondary education, or the 'avviamento al lavoro' (work training), which was intended to give a quick entry into the low strates of the workforce.\nThe reform enhanced the role of the \"Liceo Classico\", created by the Casati Act in 1859 (and intended during the Fascist era as the peak of secondary education, with the goal of forming the future upper classes), and created the Technical, Commercial and Industrial institutes and the \"Liceo Scientifico\".\nThe \"Liceo Classico\" was the only secondary school that gave access to all types of higher education until 1968.\nThe influence of Gentile's Idealism was great, and he considered the Catholic religion to be the \"foundation and crowning\" of education.\nIn 1962 the 'avviamento al lavoro' was abolished, and all children up to 14 years had to follow a single program, encompassing primary education (\"scuola elementare\") and middle school (\"scuola media\").\n\nFrom 1962 to the present day, the main structure of Italian primary (and secondary) education remained largely unchanged, even if some modifications were made: a narrowing of the gap between males and females (through the merging of the two distinct programmes for \"technical education\", and the optional introduction of mixed-gender gym classes), a change in the structure of secondary school (\"legge Berlinguer\") and the creation of new \"licei\", 'istituti tecnici' and 'istituti professionali', giving the student more choices in their paths.\n\nIn 1999, in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Bologna Process, the Italian university system switched from the old system (\"vecchio ordinamento\", which led to the traditional 5-year \"Laurea\" degree), to the new system (\"nuovo ordinamento\"). The \"nuovo ordinamento\" split the former \"Laurea\" into two tracks: the \"Laurea triennale\" (a three-year degree akin to the Bachelor's Degree), followed by the 2-year \"Laurea specialistica\" (Master's Degree), the latter renamed \"Laurea Magistrale\" in 2007. A credit system was established to quantify the amount of work needed by each course and exam (25 work hours = 1 credit), as well as enhance the possibility to change course of studies and facilitate the transfer of credits for further studies or go on exchange (e.g. Erasmus Programme) in another country. However, it is now established that there is just a five-year degree \"Laurea Magistrale a Ciclo Unico\" for programmes such as Law and a six-year degree for Medicine.\n\nIn 2019, Education minister Lorenzo Fioramonti announced that next year Italy will be the first country in the world where the study of climate change and sustainable development will be mandatory for students.\n\n\"Scuola primaria\" (primary school), also known as \"scuola elementare\", is commonly preceded by three years of non-compulsory nursery school (or kindergarten, \"asilo\"). \"Scuola elementare\" lasts five years. Until middle school, the educational curriculum is the same for all pupils: although one can attend a private or state-funded school, the subjects studied are the same (with the exception of special schools for the blind or the hearing-impaired). The students are given a basic education in Italian, English, mathematics, natural sciences, history, geography, social studies, and physical education. Some schools also have Spanish or French, musical arts and visual arts.\n\nUntil 2004, pupils had to pass an exam to access \"Scuola secondaria di primo grado\" (Middle school), comprising the composition of a short essay in Italian, a written math test, and an oral test on the other subjects. The exam has been discontinued and pupils can now enter \"Scuola secondaria di Primo Grado\" directly.\n\nUsually students start Primary School at the age of 6, but students who are born between January and March and are still 5 years old can access primary school early; this is called \"Primina\". For example, a student born in February 2002 can attend primary school with students born in 2001.\n\nSecondary education in Italy lasts 8 years and is divided in two stages: \"Scuola secondaria di primo grado\" (Lower secondary school), also broadly known as \"Scuola media\", which corresponds to the Middle School grades, and \"Scuola secondaria di secondo grado\" (Upper secondary school), also broadly known as \"Scuola superiore\", which corresponds to the high-school level.\n\nThe \"Scuola secondaria di primo grado\" lasts three years (roughly from age 11 to 14).\n\nThe \"Scuola secondaria di secondo grado\" lasts five years (roughly from age 14 to 19). Every tier involves an exam at the end of the final year, called \"esame di maturità\", required to gain a degree and have access to further university education.\n\nWhile students in lower secondary school stay in their classroom for most of the time (during physical education they go to the gym for example), in high school they will be the one to move from the classroom to the laboratory, but the teacher still has to move from one classroom to another if the lesson is not held in a laboratory.\n\nIn the lower middle school pupils start school at 8:00 AM and finish at 1:00 PM (Although they can start later, they always have to attend school for at least five hours, with some differences based on the days they attend), while for high school, depending on the school, they attend school 5 to 8 hours a day based on the day of the week and the exact choice of school.\nMost schools have 10 minutes of recess, although high school students have 15 to 30 minutes depending on how long the day is.\n\nFor historical reasons, there are three types of \"Scuola secondaria di secondo grado\", subsequently divided into further specialization. Currently all of the secondary schools in Italy have most of the structure and subjects in common for the first two years (\"Primo biennio\")(such as Italian grammar, history and mathematics), in the last three years (\"Secondo biennio e quinto anno,\" or \"triennio\") most subjects are peculiar to a particular type of course (i.e. ancient Greek in the Liceo Classico, business economics in the Istituto tecnico economico or scenography in the Liceo Artistico) but subjects like Italian, English and mathematics are still taught.:\n\nAny type of secondary school that lasts 5 years grants access to the final exam, called \"esame di maturità\" or \"esame di stato\"; this exam takes place every year between June and July and grants access to university.\n\nIn 2013, The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranks the Italian secondary education as the 21st in the world, above the United States and in the OECD average, and observes a wide gap between results in Northern Italian schools, which performed significantly better than the national average (among the best in the world in some subjects), and Southern Italian schools, that had much poorer results. Moreover, students in state-owned schools perform better than students in private schools. An Italian student is 19 when they enter university, while in other countries 18 is the more common age.\n\nItaly has a large and international network of public and state affiliated universities and schools offering degrees in higher education. State-run universities of Italy constitute the main percentage of tertiary education in Italy, and are managed under the supervision of Italian's Ministry of Education.\n\nItalian universities are among the oldest universities in the world. In particular the University of Bologna (founded in 1088), University of Padua, founded in 1222, and the University of Naples Federico II are the oldest universities in Europe. Most universities in Italy are state-supported.\n\nThere are also a number of Superior Graduate Schools (\"Grandes écoles\") or \"Scuola Superiore Universitaria\", offer officially recognized titles, including the \"Diploma di Perfezionamento\" equivalent to a Doctorate, \"Dottorato di Ricerca\" i.e. Research Doctorate or \"Doctor Philosophiae\" i.e. Ph.D. Some of them also organize courses Master's degree. There are three Superior Graduate Schools with \"university status\", three institutes with the status of Doctoral Colleges, which function at graduate and post-graduate level. Nine further schools are direct offshoots of the universities (i.e. do not have their own 'university status'). The first one is the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (founded in 1810 by Napoleon as a branch of École Normale Supérieure), taking the model of organization from the famous École Normale Supérieure. These institutions are commonly referred to as \"Schools of Excellence\" (i.e. \"Scuole di Eccellenza\").\n\nItaly hosts a broad variety of universities, colleges and academies. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologna is likely the oldest in the world. In 2009, the University of Bologna is, according to The Times, the only Italian college in the top 200 World Universities. Milan's Bocconi University has been ranked among the top 20 best business schools in the world by The Wall Street Journal international rankings, especially thanks to its M.B.A. program, which in 2007 placed it no. 17 in the world in terms of graduate recruitment preference by major multinational companies. Bocconi was also ranked by Forbes as the best worldwide in the specific category Value for Money. In May 2008, Bocconi overtook several traditionally top global business schools in the Financial Times Executive education ranking, reaching no. 5 in Europe and no. 15 in the world.\n\nOther top universities and polytechnics include the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, the LUISS in Rome, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the Politecnico di Milano (which in 2011 was ranked as the 48th best technical university in the world by QS World University Rankings), the University of Rome La Sapienza (which in 2005 was Europe's 33rd best university, and ranks among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges and in 2013, the Center for World University Rankings ranked the Sapienza University of Rome 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its \"World University Rankings\".) and the University of Milan (whose research and teaching activities have developed over the years and have received important international recognition). The University is the only Italian member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), a prestigious group of twenty research-intensive European Universities. It has also been awarded ranking positions such as 1st in Italy and 7th in Europe (The Leiden Ranking – Universiteit Leiden).\n\nAccording to National Science Indicators (1981–2002), a database produced by Research Services Group containing listings of output and citation statistics for more than 90 countries, Italy has an above-average output of scientific papers (in terms of number of papers written with at least one author being from Italy) in space science (9.75% of papers in the world being from Italy), mathematics (5.51% of papers in the world), computer science, neurosciences, and physics; the lowest, but still slightly above world-average, output in terms of number of papers produced is recorded in the social sciences, psychology and psychiatry, and economics and business.\n\nCompulsory education is highlighted in yellow.\n\n"}

The gang was not taken very seriously among the other gangs of the period, however, and often walked out in the middle of robberies when such activities bored them.

The ADLFF has a strong focus on local South Australian and Australian produced content, with the Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund (AFFIF) established to fund investment in Australian films.\n\nEstablished in 2003, it was listed in \"Variety\"'s \"50 Unmissable Film Festivals\" in 2007.\n\nAn independently financed Adelaide International Film Festival had been held from 1959 to 1980. The idea of a new film festival to stimulate the local film industry and celebrate the 30th anniversary of the South Australian Film Corporation was raised by South Australian Premier Hon. Mike Rann in 2002, and a director and board were appointed. The Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund was created to fund the Film Festival and other events.\n\nThe inaugural Adelaide Film Festival was held from 28 February to 3 March 2003. It ran a programme of screenings, special events and forums in a number of cinemas across Adelaide. Since then, the Festival has been held in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016 (a one-off \"Rogue\" event), 2017, 2018 and a \"pop-up\" weekend festival in March 2019.\n\nIt was known as the BigPond Adelaide Film Festival, or BAFF, until 2011, as its main sponsor was BigPond (now Telstra Media).\n\nSince 2017, Festival events have taken place mainly at the GU Event Cinemas in Hindley Street, with some sessions at the smaller Mercury Cinema in Morphett Street.\n\nKatrina Sedgwick was the Festival's founding director in 2002. She had previously co-founded the 1995 Sydney Fringe Festival, was the Special Events Producer (1998, 2000) for the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and the Artistic Director for the 2002 Adelaide Fringe. In 2007, Sedgwick introduced an international jury prize to the festival. At the time of her stepping down from the role of Festival director in 2013, Sedgwick said that the festival was the first in Australia to introduce an international competition, and a production fund, and that ticket sales had grown by 20 per cent each year.\n\n2013 was Amanda Duthie's first year as Festival Director, after spending eight years at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight years at the Special Broadcasting Service during the 1990s.\n\nThe 6th Adelaide Film Festival took place from 10 to 20 October 2013. This was Amanda Duthie's first year as Festival Director (after eight years at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight years at the Special Broadcasting Service during the 1990s), having taken over from Katrina Sedgwick. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton served as the festival's patrons.\n\nScott Hicks received the 2013 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry.\n\nThe poster in 2013 depicted Screen Worship, which celebrates work for all screens—cinema, television, phone and computer.\n\nThe 7th Adelaide Film Festival was held from 15–25 October 2015. Amanda Duthie was again the Festival Director. On the opening night of the festival, Director and screenwriter Andrew Bovell received the 2015 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry.\n\nThe festival opened with Scott Hicks's documentary film \"Highly Strung\", and closed with Paolo Sorrentino's drama film \"Youth\".\n\nMore than 180 feature films were screened at the festival, 40 of which were Australian films, 24 South Australian films and total of 51 countries were represented at the Festival.\n\nAs part of the 2015 Adelaide Film Festival, a public art installation was presented, incorporating a Laneway Cinema in Cinema Place, showing moving image artworks, and a 'Reactive Wall', where six artists created 2D visual artworks live in response to content within the festival.\n\nHaving previously been held biennially, the Adelaide Film Festival went \"rogue\" in October 2016 with a \"mini-festival\" in an in-between year. The first of the works commissioned by the Adelaide Film Festival Fund was the Australian premiere season of \"Collisions\" (5–30 October). Then there was a free talk by Greg Mackie at the Adelaide Festival of Ideas on 23 October, and the events culminated in a 4-day mini-festival (27–30 October) featuring world premiere screenings of two films – Australia's first Muslim rom-com \"Ali's Wedding\", based on the life of actor, writer and comedian Osamah Sami, and a special \"work in progress\" screening of \"David Stratton's Stories of Australian Cinema\", directed by Sally Aitken (later released as \"David Stratton: A Cinematic Life\"). Other films shown were \"Gimme Danger\", a documentary film about the Stooges, and a retrospective screening of \"Lucky Miles\" (2007).\n\nAt the 2017 festival, the theme \"Vive le Punk\" celebrated the punk movement's 40th anniversary. It featured \"A Fantastic Woman\", \"Call Me By Your Name\", a set by Adelaide punk band Exploding White Mice and Ai Weiwei's documentary about migration, \"Human Flow\".\n\nIn April 2017, the Premier Jay Weatherill announced that a full festival, including new funding of A$1m for the ADL Film Fest Fund, would run again in October 2018.\n\n\"Hotel Mumbai\", \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\", rock documentary \"Bad Reputation\" (about Joan Jett) and \"The Nightingale\" (directed by \"Babadook\" director Jennifer Kent) were some of the films shown.\n\nIn April 2019, a weekend \"pop-up\" event was held, to showcase Wayne Blair's romcom, \"Top End Wedding\", and Adelaide filmmaker Sophie Hyde's Australian/Irish co-production \"Animals.\"\n\nThe Board of the Adelaide Film Festival consisted of:\n\n\nFormer Board members include Cheryl Bart, Andrew Bovell, Judith Crombie, Mojgan Khadem, Gabrielle Kelly, Wayne Lewis, Barry Loane, Sue Maslin, Jacinta Thompson, Leanne Thomas Sam White, Greg Knagge and \nJamie Restas.\n\nThe Don Dunstan Award was established in honour of Don Dunstan, Premier of South Australia and is presented by the Board of the Adelaide Film Festival in recognition of the outstanding contribution by an individual to the Australian film industry who has \"enriched Australian screen culture through their work\".\n\nPast recipients have included:\n\nADL Film Fest was the first Australian film festival to create a juried prize for best feature film.\n\n2018\n\nAwarded to Kamila Andini for \"The Seen and Unseen\".\n\nThe films selected for competition:\n\n\n2017\n\nAwarded to Rungano Nyoni for I Am Not A Witch (France, United Kingdom)\n\nThe other films selected for competition:\n\n\n2015\n\nAwarded to Gabriel Mascaro for \"Neon Bull\" (Brazil/ Uruguay/ Netherlands)\n\nThe other films selected for competition:\n\n· \"316\", dir.

The purpose of the Foundation is to promote, stimulate, support and participate in any possible manner in cultural, educational, intellectual, artistic, social, philanthropic, scientific or sports initiatives, works and enterprises, in their most relevant aspects. To achieve its goals, the Foundation instituted the Konex Awards to be granted to personalities and institutions standing out for his, her or its achievements in any of the aforementioned fields. The Konex Awards were instituted in 1980 to be annually granted to sow for the future so that the most distinguished contemporary personalities and institutions in every field, which compose the cultural spectrum of the nation, will be an example to the nation's youths.\n\nEvery year the Konex Foundation offers those awards in different activities in the nation, in cycles that repeat themselves every ten years. Initially and in the ten-year span from 1980 to 1989, such personalities received awards for their life-time accomplishments. As from 1990 to 1999 the accomplishments to receive awards represented the last ten years of activity. From the year 2000 through 2009 such cycle is repeated, and it will be repeated indefinitely.\n\n\nEvery year a Grand Jury including 20 members is appointed. The members are specialists in the specific subjects receiving the award, and they appoint their own president. The members of the Jury exclude themselves from being chosen for a Konex Award; a gesture that the Foundation emphasizes and thanks very specially. Each year the activity receiving a prize is classified by the Grand Jury into 20 disciplines. The Grand Jury selects the recipients for the following awards:\n\n\nThe Grand Jury selects the five personalities or institutions that show the most remarkable accomplishments in each of the 20 chosen disciplines, awarding each of these 100 personalities or institutions a Merit Diploma in a public ceremony. Then the Grand Jury selects one figure out of the five awarded to receive the Platinum Konex. Among the 20 Platinum Konex winners, the Grand Jury selects the Diamond Konex recipient, the most outstanding personality or institution considered the most relevant figure of the activity. The Honour Konex is granted to an outstanding deceased personality. The Grand Jury also has the power to grant Special Mentions to those who are considered worthy of the award but do not specifically fit within given disciplines. Since 2002 the Grand Jury has the authority to grant the Mercosur Konex to the most relevant living personalities of the countries linked to Mercosur. All awards are presented in a final, special ceremony in which the recipients are granted a distinctive symbol called Konex Trophy.\n\nThe Konex Foundation further has the authority to grant the Konex Decoration to honor personalities who have brilliant careers around the world, for their contribution to universal culture. Thus far, two Konex Decorations have been granted: Yehudi Menuhin in 1994 and Mstislav Rostropovich in 2002.\n\n"}

He made his first-class debut for Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1987 (having played a single Sunday League match for them the previous season) and remained with that county for his entire career, scoring 3,778 runs at 27.98 and taking 262 wickets at 30.35 with his medium-pace seamers in his 124 matches.\n\nEnormously popular with the Lancashire crowd thanks to his uncomplicated batting style and equally old-fashioned waistline, his most successful period came towards the end of his career. In 1998, he helped his county to both NatWest Trophy and Sunday League success. He then made his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka later in the summer. For these performances he was made one of 1999's Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\n\nAustin was selected for the 1999 World Cup squad, and opened the bowling with Darren Gough in England's opening game, taking 2–25 against Sri Lanka at Lord's. However, his international career was to last just one more match, against Kenya later in the same tournament. He spent the rest of his career at Lancashire, where his benefit in 2000 raised £155,000. Austin played no first-class cricket after early June 2001, but continued to appear in some one-day games for another year.\n\nAfter some appearances for Cumberland in 2002, and participating in the Lancashire League's Worsley Cup final the following year, Austin retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2003 season. He returned to the Leagues playing with distinction for St Annes in the Northern Premier League, before returning to his boyhood club, Baxenden and helping them to the Ribblesdale League title, before retiring from all cricket at the end of the 2010 season.\n"}

{"id": "2019657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019657", "title": "LMS Patriot Class", "text": "LMS Patriot Class\n\nThe Patriot Class was a class of 52 express passenger steam locomotives built for the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The first locomotive of the class was built in 1930 and the last in 1934. The class was based on the chassis of the Royal Scot combined with the boiler from Large Claughtons earning them the nickname \"Baby Scots\". A total of 18 were rebuilt to create the LMS Rebuilt Patriot Class between 1946 and 1948; thereafter those not subjected to rebuilding were often referred to as the Unrebuilt Patriot Class. These remaining 34 unrebuilt engines were withdrawn between 1960 and 1962.\n\nThe first two were rebuilt in 1930 from the 1912-built LNWR Large Claughton Class, retaining the original driving wheels with their large bosses, the \"double radial\" bogie truck and some other parts. Of the subsequent 50 locomotives of the class 40 were nominal rebuilds of Claughtons, being in fact new builds classified as rebuilt engines so that they could be charged to revenue accounts, rather than capital. The last ten were classified as new builds.\n\nThe two former Claughtons retained their original numbers until 1934, when they were renumbered 5500–1. The 40 built as replacements took the numbers of the Claughtons that they replaced; these were renumbered 5502–41 in 1934. The remainder of the class were allocated nos. 6030–9, but were numbered 5542–51 from new. The numbering of the similar LMS Jubilee Class continued on from where the Patriots left off. This was because 5552–5556 were ordered as Patriots (to be numbered 6040–4) but built with taper boilers as Jubilees on the orders of Sir William Stanier.\n\nNaming of the class was somewhat erratic. Some retained old Claughton names, whilst others continued the military associations of the names \"Patriot\" and \"St Dunstans\", and 13 carried names of holiday resorts served by the LMS. Seven remained unnamed, although they had been allocated names in 1943.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1949 eighteen were rebuilt with Stanier 2A boiler, cab and tender, though again these were largely paper rebuilds, based on the LMS Rebuilt Royal Scot Class. Seven (Nos 5514/21/6/9-31/40) had been rebuilt by the start of 1948 when British Railways inherited the remaining 45 Baby Scots. In March 1948 BR added 40000 to their numbers to number them 45500–13/15-20/2-5/7/8/32-9/41-51. Subsequently, BR rebuilt another 11, so that the rebuilt engines were (4)5512/14/21–23/25–32/34–36/45. The two original members of the class, and the first ten of the nominal rebuilds, were not rebuilt due to their non-standard parts.\n\nNote some never received BR numbers as unrebuilt engines because either they were rebuilt by the LMS. In the table below BR numbers for BR-rebuilt engines are given, but some engines may not have received BR numbers while in an unrebuilt condition as renumbering took several years (sources should indicate these).\n\n\nAll of the unrebuilt Patriots were withdrawn between 1960 and 1962 in accordance with the BR Modernisation Plan.\n\nNo Patriot in either rebuilt or unrebuilt form survived into preservation; however, a new replica 'Patriot' is under construction. The LMS-Patriot Project, a registered charity, is building a replica which will carry the number of the last built – LMS number 5551 or British Railways number 45551. It will be named \"The Unknown Warrior\".\n\nThis class of engine forms the basis of the Big City Engine from the Railway Series of children's books by the Rev. W. Awdry.\n\nBoth Hornby and Bachmann have produced OO gauge models.\n\nHornby first introduced an original Patriot in the 1979 catalogue that has remained in production and now forms part of the 'Railroad' budget (i.e. toy) range. The following models have been produced:\n\nBachmann Industries make a more detailed and expensive model of the original Patriot, also in OO gauge. The following models have been produced:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2019680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019680", "title": "Corralito", "text": "Corralito\n\nCorralito () was the informal name for the economic measures taken in Argentina at the end of 2001 by Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo in order to stop a bank run, and which were fully in force for one year. The almost completely froze bank accounts and forbade withdrawals from U.S. dollar-denominated accounts.\n\nThe Spanish word \"corralito\" is the diminutive form of \"corral\", which means \"corral, animal pen, enclosure\"; the diminutive is used in the sense of \"small enclosure\" and also \"a child's playpen\". This expressive name alludes to the restrictions imposed by the measure. The term was coined by the journalist Antonio Laje.\n\nIn 2001, Argentina was in the midst of a crisis: heavily indebted, with an economy in complete stagnation (an almost three-year-long recession), and the exchange rate was fixed at one U. S. dollar per Argentine peso by law, which made exports uncompetitive and effectively deprived the state of having an independent monetary policy. Many Argentines, but most especially companies, fearing an economic crash and possibly a devaluation, were transforming pesos to dollars and withdrawing them from the banks in large amounts, usually transferring them to foreign accounts (capital flight).\n\nOn December 1, 2001, in order to stop this draining from destroying the banking system, the government froze all bank accounts, initially for 90 days. Only a small amount of cash was allowed for withdrawal on a weekly basis (initially 250 Argentine pesos, then 300), and only from accounts denominated in pesos. No withdrawals were allowed from accounts denominated in U.S. dollars, unless the owner agreed to convert the funds into pesos. Operations using credit cards, debit cards, cheques and other means of payment could be conducted normally, but the lack of cash availability caused numerous problems for the general public and for businesses.\n\nThe \"corralito\" caused an immediate backfire on the government. Even more people started trying to withdraw their money from the banks, and many ended up in court fighting for their right to have their funds (and being granted that right on occasion).\n\nThe main reason for ending up in court was that, after the corralito, and after Economy Minister Cavallo resigned, the new government led by Eduardo Duhalde and his Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna converted those funds nominated in US dollars into Argentine pesos at a 1 peso = 1 US dollar exchange rate, while the exchange rate was liberalized (immediately going to 4 pesos = 1 US dollar). \n\nThe same was done with debtors, so many private enterprises and also the Province of Buenos Aires were favoured by this measure as they managed to decrease their debts. Nine years later, several people had not yet been able to recover their savings because of the pace of justice in Argentina. However, debtors were able to purchase properties and other items by paying their debts at the 1 to 1 exchange rate.\n\nAt the time, the average Argentine did not employ the banking system for daily uses; many did not have a personal bank account, and dealt only with cash. Debit cards were not popular and many businesses did not have the equipment to accept them. Thus the cash restrictions only exacerbated the recession and angered the public. President Fernando de la Rúa resigned on 20 December 2001 after violent riots, but the restrictions of the \"corralito\" were not lifted at the time.\n\nArgentina's situation worsened for several months. The \"corralito\" was hardened during the interim rule of President Eduardo Duhalde, and turned into a \"corralón\" (\"big corral\"). The \"corralón\" differed from the \"corralito\" in that most deposits were forcibly exchanged for a series of bonds denominated in pesos. The dollar-denominated accounts were automatically exchanged for pesos and peso bonds at a predetermined rate. The real necessity of such decision was questioned by several observers at the time, and some suggested this move benefited some large companies which were insolvent (or nearly so) whose owners had sent their dollars abroad before the \"corralito\"; these owners were thus able to repay their companies' now devalued debts by converting much fewer dollars than it would have taken previously.\n\nThe peso was first devalued (from 1.0 to 1.4 pesos/dollar) and then floated, thereby quickly depreciating to a maximum rate of nearly 4 pesos per dollar. Argentina's economy then gradually began a recovery from its abysmal state, spurred by exports that benefited from the heightened exchange rate, and by the declaration of default on most of its debt, which left the government with more money available to expand the economy.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the banks had a share of the blame for the situation that led to the \"corralito\". In mid-2001, it was probably clear to bank owners and high-ranking officials that Argentina's banking system was going to crash, and some in fact may have spurred this outcome by letting their highest deposit holders know this news. These, mostly large companies, quickly moved their deposits abroad. Meanwhile, they continued to recommend their middle-class customers to enter deposits. \n\nIt is also believed that in the end the \"corralito\" ended up being good business for some international banks since they negotiated with the Argentine government to receive compensation bonds for the \"missing\" money, which in a large proportion had never really left their banks, only moved from one branch to another.\n\nMost banks stayed in the country during the crisis, withstanding a severe damage to their reputation as well as (in certain cases) physical attacks. Others fled as soon as problems arose (for example, Scotiabank's Argentine branch, Scotiabank Quilmes).\n\nThe \"corralito\" officially ended on December 2, 2002, when Minister of Economy Roberto Lavagna announced the liberation of deposits for about 23.7 billion pesos (though not of 17.3 billion pesos in formerly dollar-denominated long-term accounts). The measure was coupled with exchange market controls, by which no person or business was allowed to buy more than 100,000 dollars; this was done to prevent the possible effects of the sudden availability of pesos.\n\n"}

Part of the WOMAD festivals organisation, WOMADelaide aims to excite, to create, to inform and to highlight awareness of the worth and potential of a multicultural society. The festival encourages people to experience the music of cultures other than their own as a way of developing global understanding, and aims to entertain all age groups and people from all backgrounds. WOMADelaide has won the Helpmann Award for \"Best Contemporary Music Festival\" in 2008 and 2016, the Australian Event Awards \"Best Cultural, Arts or Music Event\" in 2015, and the Fowlers Live / SA Music Awards \"Best Live Music Event\" for 5 years in a row, 2012 - 2016.\n\nWOMADelaide was first run in 1992 as part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts. From 1993 it ran every two years (in odd-numbered years) so as to not conflict with subsequent editions of the Festival. From 1996 the management and production of WOMADelaide was taken on by the Adelaide-based company, Arts Projects Australia.\n\nIn 2003, WOMADelaide became an annual festival following a decision made by the Rann government to financially support the event. That year, WOMADelaide Foundation Limited was also established as a not-for-profit organisation. The Foundation presented subsequent festivals and special projects for remote Indigenous arts communities.\n\nIn 2010, in celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Adelaide Festival of Arts, WOMADelaide extended to four days. Due to overwhelming popularity, the festival has now permanently taken on the fourth day. That year, WOMADelaide was produced and presented by the WOMADelaide Foundation, was managed by Arts Projects Australia and WOMAD Ltd, and was presented in association with the Government of South Australia.\n\nIn 2015 the South Australian Tourism Commission (an agency of the Government of South Australia) replaced the Government of South Australia as the event's new principal partner. As of 2017, the South Australian Tourism Commission remains the event's principal partner.\n\nIn 2017, WOMADelaide became a smoke-free event, with provision for smoking in three designated areas.\n\nWOMADelaide has grown steadily in audience size from 30,000 in 1993 to over 90,000 annually since 2014. \"About 95,000\" people attended in 2015. All prior attendance records were broken in 2016 when over 95,000 people attended.\n\nIn 2008 WOMADelaide won the FasterLouder Festival Award for best Sound & Production. WOMADelaide also received the 2008 Helpmann Award for Best Contemporary Music Festival.\n\nWOMADelaide is held in Botanic Park, which is situated north-east of central Adelaide, between the Adelaide Zoo and Adelaide Botanic Garden. The 34-hectare park is fenced off for the duration of the festival, providing an enormous amount of space. The main stages are set up around a backstage compound with Stage 1 in the middle and Stages 2 and 3 on either side, all facing out from the backstage area. There are an additional four smaller stages (Zoo Stage, Moreton Bay Stage and two in Speakers Corner). There are also visual arts exhibitions, a KidZone, a Global Village market area with over 100 food, crafts and display stalls, as well as several bars. All front-of-stage areas, the KidZone and the food and drink area are designated smoke-free. WOMADelaide currently leads the way in Waste Minimisation working closely with Zero Waste SA. After the 2005 festival some six tonnes of compost from WOMADelaide waste were returned to the Botanic Gardens in an effort to preserve the delicate ecosystem in which the event is located. In 2007, WOMADelaide joined forces with Greening Australia, Australia’s largest environmental organisation, to remove the global warming impact of the event. The carbon generated through artists’ travel, and the festival site lighting and power was offset through the re-vegetation of native bushland in SA, which also helped to restore native habitat for rare and endangered species and reduce the effects of salinity.\n\nWOMADelaide draws its performing artists from all over the world. A specific emphasis is placed on traditional music and performances of various cultures although some more contemporary, popular acts are included. The festival runs from 6pm to 1am on Friday, from 12noon until 1am on Saturday and from 12noon-12midnight on Sunday. In 2010, due to substantial popularity WOMADelaide was extended to include Monday from 12noon - 12midnight, making the festival four days in length. Artists also lead workshops demonstrating and/or discussing aspects of their performances on smaller stages. There are also artists who do 'roving' performances through the park and installation pieces, such as La Compagnie Carabosse who set up large fire installations at the 2005 festival.\n\nMore than 300 groups from 80 countries have appeared at the festival since 1992, including:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2019696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019696", "title": "J. Reuben Clark", "text": "J. Reuben Clark\n\nJoshua Reuben Clark Jr. (September 1, 1871 – October 6, 1961) was an American attorney, civil servant, and a prominent leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Born in Grantsville, Utah Territory, Clark was a prominent attorney in the Department of State, and Undersecretary of State for U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. In 1930, Clark was appointed United States Ambassador to Mexico.\n\nClark received a bachelor's degree from the University of Utah, where he was valedictorian and student-body president. Clark received a law degree from Columbia University, where he also became a member of Phi Delta Phi, a prominent international legal fraternity in which he remained active throughout his life.\n\nClark later became an associate professor at George Washington University. Both the J. Reuben Clark Law Society and the J. Reuben Clark Law School at Brigham Young University (BYU) are named in his honor.\n\nClark was the first of ten children born to Joshua R. and Mary Louisa Woolley Clark. He was born and raised in Grantsville, Utah, 33 miles southwest of Salt Lake City in Tooele Valley. At the time, it was a four-hour trip by buggy and train from Grantsville to Salt Lake City. The LDS Church members who settled the area were industrious and community-oriented.\n\nAs a break from farmwork, Clark participated in dramatic productions from his youth. He displayed a talent for public speaking, comedy, and humor at a young age. Clark also participated in the childhood diversions available on the frontier, sledding in the winter and swimming in the summer.\n\nClark's grandfather had been a minister in the Dunker Faith (Church of the Brethren). Clark's father, Joshua, had worked his way west through Utah as a trapper and freighter and felt drawn to the LDS Church after attending his first Sunday service, being baptized a month afterward. Education and culture were important in the Mormon communities in Utah Territory. Clark's father, although accustomed to hard physical labor, was also reputed to be a knowledgeable, culturally-oriented man. He was hired soon after his baptism to teach school in Grantsville.\n\nShortly after moving there from Salt Lake City, Clark's father married Mary Louisa Woolley, who was born on the plains as her parents made their way west with the Mormon pioneers. Clark's father was the sort of man who, while doing business in Salt Lake City, would sleep in a hay loft to afford to see a Shakespearean play, and he would make great sacrifices to afford to buy a good book. The small library in the Clark home was made up of history books, classics, an encyclopedia, the Bible, plus other religious works of the LDS Church. Although the younger Clark's education was spotty in his youth because of the demands of farm life and meager family resources, he was able to take music lessons and to play with various bands. He played the piccolo and then the flute.\n\nClark's father became the clerk, then superintendent, of the Grantsville educational co-operative, was elected the Tooele County Superintendent of Schools in 1878, became president of the Tooele County Education Association, and by 1879 was assessor and tax collector, with his two eldest sons helped with the accounting and record-keeping.\n\nWhen his father later taught at a local private school, Clark was able to be formally educated for the first time. He was ten years old and had been schooled by his mother. Clark was not at school every term; sometimes, financial difficulties and farm work kept him at home. His father once related that Clark would \"rather miss his meals than to miss a day from school.\" After completing the eighth grade, the highest grade offered at the Grantsville school, Clark repeated it two more times.\n\nIn 1890, at age 19 and with his father’s consent, Clark was taken to Salt Lake City to enter Latter-day Saints' University. Clark lived at the home of an aunt to save money, and he earned extremely high grades. The principal of the school was James E. Talmage, the foremost scholar and scientist in the LDS Church. Talmage hired Clark to be the assistant curator (and later, curator) for the Deseret Museum. It was a paid position and helped immensely to support Clark during his higher education. The curator position was also considered a mission and relieved Clark of being called to serve a formal full-time mission for the LDS Church. When Talmage was released as principal and called to create a new college for the LDS Church, he brought Clark with him as his chemistry lab assistant and clerk. While Clark would still curate at the museum, this helped Clark with his financial support and enabled him to finish six years of advanced schooling in four. Two of the years were intended to finish his unmet high school requirements. It was Talmage who called Clark \"the greatest mind ever to leave Utah\" and who encouraged him to attend an eastern university.\n\nIn 1894, Clark entered the University of Utah. Clark lived frugally and was even able to partially support his father, who had been called to serve as a missionary in the church's Northern States Mission, then as the mission president.\n\nTalmage later became the president of the University of Utah and was also the first recipient of the recently endowed Deseret Professorship of Geology. Clark graduated in 1898 as valedictorian of his graduating class, while still serving as clerk to Talmage and on the faculty of the university. He had met Luacine (\"Lute\") Annetta Savage, the youngest daughter of Charles Roscoe Savage of Salt Lake City, in 1894, but he could not afford to marry her. She taught kindergarten and then worked at her father's store while dating Clark for four years. They married on September 14, 1898, in the Salt Lake Temple.\n\nTalmage performed the sealing, the first that he performed. The couple had a modest reception by Lute's choice, owing to Clark's small means, but she came from a prosperous family. A few days later, Clark left for Heber, Utah, to find a place for them to live and start his first career position as a teacher and principal of the new Heber City High School.\n\nThe next year, Clark signed on as a teacher at Latter-day Saints' University, but he resigned in February to teach at Salt Lake Business College. Joseph Nelson headed the college and became an important benefactor to Clark. In the fall of 1900, Clark went to Cedar City, Utah, to become the principal of the Branch Normal School. The following year, Clark was an instructor in Commercial Law, Principal of the Shorthand Department, and Secretary of the Faculty at Salt Lake Business College. In 1903, Nelson was named cashier of the Utah National Bank, and Clark assumed most of his duties at the college. That year, Nelson offered to pay for law school for Clark, and Clark applied to Columbia University. He was accepted, and he received his entire education in law at Columbia.\n\nIn the beginning of Clark's second year of law school at Columbia, he was elected to the editorial board of the Columbia Law Review. He was the oldest on the board, the only one married, and the only Latter-day Saint in the law school. In 1905, at the end of his second year of law school, he was admitted to the New York bar. He was granted a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1906. Clark had worked with James Brown Scott on the 772-page book \"Cases on Quasi Contracts\" (1905) during his schooling. Scott recommended him as Assistant Solicitor of the Department of State, and Clark received the appointment on September 5, 1906.\n\nClark began his government service in 1906, when he was appointed Assistant Solicitor to the State Department. During his tenure in Washington, the Clark family (consisting of Clark, his wife and four children) was in the wake of the controversy over the Reed Smoot hearings in the US Senate.\n\nIn his position as Assistant Solicitor and then as Solicitor in the State Department, Clark was often confronted with critical issues of international consequence. For example, when the Mexican Revolution erupted in 1911, he was called upon to make crucial decisions and recommend courses of action to the secretary of state and Howard Taft. Of particular concern to Clark was the plight of the Latter-day Saints who lived in the Mexican colonies and were often caught in the middle of the conflict and whose presence in Mexico was resented by the revolutionaries.\n\nAfter resigning from the State Department in 1913, after the election of Woodrow Wilson, Clark turned his attention to the practice of law. His family returned to Utah, and he opened law offices in Washington, DC; New York City; and Salt Lake City, specializing in international and corporate law. One of his first major clients was the Japanese government, which enlisted his services to combat anti-Japanese discrimination in California. Officials in the Japanese government extended an offer for him to become their permanent counsel in Tokyo and to reside in the Imperial Palace. Clark declined the offer, partly on the advice of Joseph F. Smith.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I, Clark was commissioned as a major in the Judge Advocate General Officer Reserve Corps (Army) and later asked to become Special Counsel to the Judge Advocate General. Also during World War I, Clark worked in the U.S. Attorney General's office. He also participated in creating the regulations for the Selective Service.\n\nIn 1926, Clark was called back into government service as tensions with Mexico flared. His past experience in Mexican affairs as solicitor and his experience in diplomacy were called upon as the US President appointed him to the Mexican and American Mixed Claims Commission. The Commission, established by treaty in 1924 to settle monetary disputes between the two countries, was thought to be the best means of avoiding war with Mexico. Other positions of national prominence followed, such as appointments to Special Counsel for the United States before the American-British Claim Arbitration and then Agent for the United States on the US-Mexico General and Special Claims commissions. Later, Clark took a position as personal legal adviser to the US Ambassador to Mexico, Dwight Morrow, who had been impressed with Clark's work in the State Department.\n\nIn 1928, as Under-Secretary of State to Secretary of State Frank Kellogg in the Calvin Coolidge administration, Clark wrote the \"Clark Memorandum on the Monroe Doctrine\", which repudiated the idea that the United States could arbitrarily use military force in Latin America. The Memorandum was a 238-page treatise exploring every nuance of the US's philosophy of hemispherical guardianship. It was published as an official State Department document and partially reprinted in textbooks for years.\n\nWhen Morrow resigned as ambassador to serve in the U.S Senate, Clark was recommended as his replacement. Herbert Hoover appointed Clark as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States to Mexico on October 3, 1930. That was a key post in US foreign relations and earned him instant prestige. Clark served as US ambassador to Mexico from 1930–1933.\n\nLater, while Clark was serving in the LDS Church's First Presidency, he was summoned to the White House by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who asked him to be a delegate to the Pan-American Conference at Montevideo, Uruguay. Again, in 1933, Roosevelt tapped Clark, this time to serve on the newly-formed Foreign Bondholders Protective Council.\n\nIn June 1925, Clark was appointed to the LDS Church's board of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association. In April 1933, Clark was called to serve Second Counselor in the church's First Presidency to Heber J. Grant. Grant held the position in the First Presidency vacant for over a year until Clark was able to resign from his ambassadorship and resolve necessary government matters.\n\nClark was sustained as Second Counselor to Grant on April 6, 1933. He replaced Charles W. Nibley, who had died in December 1931. The call was unusual not only for the delay between Nibley's death and Clark's call, but also because counselors were generally selected from within the church's general authorities.\n\nClark had also never been a stake president or bishop in the church. He immediately set out to relieve Grant of some of the administrative duties he placed upon himself that became a source of fatigue.\n\nGrant had been active in business throughout his life and encouraged his new second counselor to continue to take advantage of business and governmental opportunities whenever possible. Grant believed the interests of the LDS Church would be best served by Clark continuing to be involved in leadership endeavors outside the church. A week after joining the First Presidency, Clark was asked to fill a position on the board of directors of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, headquartered in New York. Soon afterward came the appointment as a delegate to the Pan-American Conference. Grant gave his approval to both proposals, and Clark felt duty-bound to again serve.\n\nFollowing the church's October 1933 General Conference, Roosevelt again asked Clark to serve on the Foreign Bondholders' Protective Council. As the Great Depression ravaged the world's economies, a billion dollars in US citizen-owned foreign bonds had fallen into default. Clark was asked to lead the Council's effort in recovering money on the defaulted bonds, first as General Counsel and then as Council President.\n\nIn 1933, Clark began urging change in the LDS Church's welfare policy, which directed members to seek assistance from the government before the church, to adopt many of the innovative techniques instituted by Harold B. Lee of the Salt Lake Pioneer Stake to aid church members, such as employment co-ordination, operation of a farm and cannery, and the organization of jobs for stake members to refurbish and sell a Utah company's unsold, defective products.\n\nIn September 1934, Grant's First Counselor, Anthony W. Ivins, died. In October 1934, Clark was ordained an apostle and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for purposes of seniority. Immediately thereafter, he was set apart as Grant's First Counselor, with David O. McKay as the Second Counselor.\n\nIn 1935, Grant presented a new \"Church Security\" program, renamed the \"Welfare Plan\" in 1938, which encouraged industry and personal responsibility and enabled the members to turn to the church instead of relying on the \"demoralizing system\" of government dependence. The Welfare Plan would centralize the church's efforts and grow to include a \"Beautification Program,\" church farms, Deseret Industries, and a Bishop's Central Storehouse. In a special meeting of stake presidents on October 2, 1936, Clark would capture the goal of church welfare: \"The real long term objective of the Welfare Plan is the building of character in the members of the Church, givers and receivers, rescuing all that is finest deep down inside of them, and bring to flower and fruitage the latent richness of the spirit which after all is the mission and purpose and reason for being of this Church.\" Clark's counsel remains the guiding principle of LDS Church welfare.\n\nIn 1940, Clark initiated a project to transmit sessions of general conference to additional assembly halls via closed circuit radio. In February 1940, Grant suffered a stroke that left the left side of his body paralyzed and eventually led to his virtual incapacitation. Soon afterward, McKay fell seriously ill, and by necessity, Clark took hold of the reins of LDS Church administration, but he always kept the other members of the First Presidency apprised and consulted with them prior to making any major decision.\n\nAfter Grant's death, Clark and McKay were also first and second counselors, respectively, to George Albert Smith. However, when Smith died and McKay became church president, he surprised some by choosing Clark as his Second Counselor, with Stephen L Richards as First Counselor. McKay cited Richards's longer tenure as an apostle as the only reason for not making Clark his first counselor, and Clark's leadership style clashed with McKay's way of doing things. It was upon being sustained as second counselor in a general conference that Clark famously remarked, \"In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines.\" Clark was returned to the position of First Counselor after Richards died in 1959. Although he served in that capacity until his death on October 6, 1961, McKay excluded Clark from much of the decision-making.\n\nIn the 1950s, while serving as Second Counselor in the First Presidency, Clark was able to see two major religious works he had been working on for several years published. In 1954, \"Our Lord of the Gospels\" a deep study of the life of Jesus Christ was brought to publication, with Thomas S. Monson serving as the representative of Deseret Book in the publishing project. In 1956, Clark's work \"Why the King James Version\", advocating continued use of the King James Bible by the church, was published.\n\nClark was closely involved with most of the administrative innovations of the church while he was in the First Presidency. He was involved especially in advocating for regional priesthood councils.\n\nClark died on October 6, 1961, at his residence, 80 D Street, Salt Lake City, Utah, at ninety years of age. Clark served in the First Presidency for over 28 years, longer than any other man who has not been church president. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.\nAs noted in D. Michael Quinn's 2002 biography, Clark's life spanned a period that saw \"enormous changes in the attitudes and conduct of Western society, the United States, and the LDS Church toward the races and ethnic peoples of the world.\" As a young man, writes Quinn, Clark possessed \"the full endowment of racism characteristic of late nineteenth-century America.\" Clark's nativist views were evident in his 1898 valedictory speech at the University of Utah in which he declared, \"America must cease to be the cess-pool into which shall drain the foul sewage of Europe.\" Clark eventually changed some of his racial and ethnic views but maintained others to the end of his life.\n\nSpeaking to a church audience in 1956 about his service as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Clark admitted that he had gone to Mexico \"with a great prejudice against the Mexican people.\" However, as he learned the people's history and lived among them, he came to develop a great affection for them.\n\nClark's views of the Japanese softened after he performed legal work on behalf of the Japanese embassy in 1913. Although his son-in-law, Mervyn S. Bennion, was killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Clark \"neither felt nor manifested any bitterness toward the Japanese,\" according to Quinn. Clark wrote to an LDS serviceman on August 3, 1945, \"I have nothing but kindness for the [Japanese] race.\"\n\nDuring Clark's lifetime, Utah had \"de facto\" segregation policies, and males of African descent were excluded from the LDS priesthood. As a church leader, Clark resisted the social integration of whites and blacks and strongly opposed interracial marriage, explaining in a 1949 letter: \"Since they are not entitled to the Priesthood, the Church discourages social intercourse with the negro race, because such intercourse leads to marriage, and the offspring possess negro blood and is therefore subject to the inhibition set out in our Scripture.\"\n\nClark nevertheless expressed support for \"Brown v. Board of Education\", stating that \"the Latter-day Saints willingly accord to [blacks] in civil matters all the rights, privileges, liberties, and protection guaranteed them... in all their social, economic, and political activities.\"\n\nQuinn notes that \"there was one ethnic group, however, for whom Reuben expressed lifelong dislike and distrust—the Jewish people.\" According to Quinn, Clark kept several copies of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" in his personal library and shared it and other anti-Semitic publications with colleagues and acquaintances. He expressed anti-Semitic attitudes in \"code words publicly and in specifics privately\" and used his church position to obstruct what he perceived as \"Jewish influence.\" After Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria, Clark denied desperate pleas by Austrian Mormon converts from Judaism who sought the church's help in emigrating to safety.\n\nClark's anti-Semitism seems to have derived at least in part from his ardent anti-Communism. Quinn notes that \"although not all American anti-Communists were anti-Semitic, the more intense tended to be. Reuben's own fusion of anti-Communism and anti-Semitism was representative of this tendency.\"\n\nClark's views put him at odds with LDS Church president David O. McKay, whose \"positive attitudes toward the Jews, Zionism, and the State of Israel were more representative of Mormons generally than were President Clark's anti-Semitic attitudes and administrative actions.\"\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2019699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019699", "title": "Color terminology for race", "text": "Color terminology for race\n\nIdentifying human races in terms of skin color, at least as one among several physiological characteristics, has been common since antiquity. Via rabbinical literature, the division is received in early modern scholarship, mostly in four to five categories. It was long recognized that the number of categories is arbitrary and subjective. François Bernier (1684) doubted the validity of using skin color as a racial characteristic, and Charles Darwin emphasized the gradual differences between categories.\n\nThe modern categorization was coined at the Göttingen School of History in the late 18th century – in parallel with the Biblical terminology for race (Semitic, Hamitic and Japhetic) – dividing mankind into five colored races: \"Aethiopian or Black\",\"Caucasian or White\",\"Mongolian or Yellow\",\"American or Red\" and \"Malayan or Brown\" subgroups.\n\nCategorization of racial groups by reference to skin color is common in classical antiquity.\nIt is found in e.g. \"Physiognomica\", a Greek treatise dated to c. 300 BC.\n\nThe transmission of the \"color terminology\" for race from antiquity to early anthropology in 17th century Europe took place via rabbinical literature. \nSpecifically, Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer (a medieval rabbinical text dated roughly to between the 7th to 12th centuries) contains the division of mankind into three groups based on the three sons of Noah, viz. Shem, Ham and Japheth: \n\nThis division in Rabbi Eliezer and other rabbinical texts is received by Georgius Hornius (1666). In Hornius' scheme, the Japhetites (identified as Scythians, an Iranic ethnic group and Celts) are \"white\" (\"albos\"), the Aethiopians and Chamae are \"black\" (\"nigros\"), and the Indians and Semites are \"brownish-yellow\" (\"flavos\"), while the Jews, following \"Mishnah Sanhedrin\", are exempt from the classification being neither black nor white but \"light brown\" (\"buxus\", the color of boxwood).\n\nFrançois Bernier in a short article published anonymously in 1684 moves away from the \"Noahide\" classification, proposes to consider large subgroups of mankind based not on geographical distribution but on physiological differences. Writing in French, Bernier uses the term \"race\", or synonymously \"espece\" \"kind, species\", where Hornius had used \"tribus\" \"tribe\" or \"populus\" \"people\".\nBernier explicitly rejects a categorization based on skin colour, arguing that the dark skin of Indians is due to exposure to the Sun only, and that the yellowish colour of some Asians, while a genuine feature, is not sufficient to establish a separate category. Instead his first category comprises most of Europe, the Near East and North Africa, including populations in the Nile Valley and the Indian peninsula he describes as being of a near \"black\" skin tone due to the effect of the sun. His second category includes most of Sub-Saharan Africa, again not exclusively based on skin colour but on physiological features such as the shape of nose and lips. His third category includes Southeast Asia, China and Japan as well as part of Tatarstan (Central Asia and eastern Muscovy). Members of this category are described as white, the categorization being based on facial features rather than skin colour. His fourth category are the Lapps (\"Lappons\"), described as a savage race with faces reminiscent of bears (but for which the author admits to rely on hearsay). Finally, the natives of the Americas are considered as a fifth category, described as of \"olive\" (\"olivastre\") skin tone.\nThe author furthermore considers the possible addition of more categories, specifically the \"blacks of the Cape of Good Hope\", which seemed to him to be of significantly different build from most other populations below the Sahara.\n\nIn the 1730s, Carl Linnaeus in his introduction of systematic taxonomy recognized four main human subspecies, termed\n\"Americanus\" (Americans), \"Europaeus\" (Europeans), \"Asiaticus\" (Asians) and \"Afer\" (Africans). The physical appearance of each type is briefly described, including colour adjectives referring to skin and hair colour: \"rufus\" \"red\" and \"pilis nigris\" \"black hair\" for Americans, \"albus\" \"white\" and \"pilis flavescentibus\" \"yellowish hair\" for Europeans, \"luridus\" \"yellowish, sallow\", \"pilis nigricantibus\" \"swarthy hair\" for Asians, \nand \"niger\" \"black\", \"pilis atris\" \"coal-black hair\" for Africans.\n\nThe views of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach on the categorization of the major races of mankind developed over the course of the 1770s to 1820s. He introduced a four-fold division in 1775, extended to five in 1779, later borne out in his work on craniology (\"Decas craniorum\", published during 1790–1828).\nHe also used color not as the name or main label of the races but as part of the description of their physiology.\nBlumenbach does not name his five groups in 1779 but gives their geographic distribution. \nThe color adjectives used in 1779 are \"weiss\" \"white\" (Caucasian race), \"gelbbraun\" \"yellow-brown\" (Mongolian race), \"schwarz\" \"black\" (Aethiopian race), \"kupferroth\" \"copper-red\" (American race) and \"schwarzbraun\" \"black-brown\" (Malayan race).\nAccording to D'Souza (1995), it was \"Blumenbach's classification\" which had a lasting influence, being memorable because it \"neatly broke down into familiar tones and colors\".\nHowever, according to Barkhaus (2006) it was the adoption of both the colour terminology and the French term \"race\" by Immanuel Kant in 1775 which proved influential. Kant published an essay \"Von den verschiedenen Racen der Menschen\" \"On the diverse races of mankind\" in 1775, based on the \nsystem proposed by Buffon, \"Histoire Naturelle\", in which he recognized four groups, a \"white\" European race (\"Race der Weißen\"), a \"black\" Negroid race (\"Negerrace\"), a copper-red Kalmyk race (\"kalmuckishe Race\") and an olive-yellow Indian race (\"Hinduische Race\").\n\nBlumenbach's division and choice of color-adjectives remained influential, with variation depending on author, throughout the 19th and well into the 20th century. René Lesson in 1847 presented a division into six groups based on simple color adjectives: White (Caucasian), Dusky (Indian), Orange-colored (Malay), Yellow (Mongoloid), Red (Carib and American), Black (Negroid).\n\nTwo historical anthropologists favored a binary racial classification system that divided people into a light skin and dark skin categories. 18th-century anthropologist Christoph Meiners, who first defined the Caucasian race, posited a \"\"binary racial scheme\"\" of two races with the Caucasian whose racial purity was exemplified by the \"\"venerated... ancient Germans\"\", although he considered some Europeans as impure \"\"dirty whites\"\"; and \"\"Mongolians\"\", who consisted of everyone else. Meiners did not include the Jews as Caucasians and ascribed them a \"\"permanently degenerate nature\"\". \nHannah Franzieka identified 19th-century writers who believed in the \"Caucasian hypothesis\" and noted that \"Jean-Julien Virey and Louis Antoine Desmoulines were well-known supports of the idea that Europeans came from Mount Caucasus.\" In his political history of racial identity, Bruce Baum wrote,\"Jean-Joseph Virey (1774-1847), a follower of Chistoph Meiners, claimed that \"the human races... may divided... into those who are fair and white and those who are dark or black.\"\nLothrop Stoddard in \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy\" (1920)\nconsidered five races, White, Black, Yellow, Brown and Amerindian.\nIn this explicitly \"white supremacist\" exposition of racial categorization, the \"white\" category is much more limited than in Blumenbach's scheme, essentially restricted to Europeans, while the separate \"brown\" category is introduced for non-European Caucasoid subgroups in North Africa, Western, Central and South Asia.\n\nFollowing World War II, more and more biologists and anthropologists began to discontinue use of the term \"race\" due to its association with political ideologies of racism. Thus, \"The Race Question\" statement by the UNESCO, in the 1950s, proposed to substitute the term \"ethnic groups\" to the concept of \"race\".\nCategories such as Europid, Mongoloid, Negroid, Australoid remain in use in field such as forensic anthropology while colour terminology remains in use in some countries with multiracial populations for the purpose of their official census, as in the United States, where the official categories are \"Black\", \"White\", \"Asian\", \"Native American and Alaska Natives\" and \"Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders\" and in the United Kingdom (since 1991) with official categories \"White\", \"Asian\" and \"Black\".\n\nThe Martinique-born French Frantz Fanon and African-American writers Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, and Ralph Ellison, among others, wrote that negative symbolisms surrounding the word \"black\" outnumber positive ones. They argued that the good vs. bad dualism associated with white and black unconsciously frame prejudiced colloquialisms. In the 1970s the term black replaced Negro in the United States.\n\nIn some societies people can be sensitive to gradations of skin tone, which may be due to intermarriage or to albinism and which can affect power and prestige. In 1930s Harlem Slang such gradations were described by a tonescale of \"high yaller [yellow], yaller, high brown, vaseline brown, seal brown, low brown, dark brown\". These terms were sometimes referred to in blues music, both in the words of songs and in the names of performers. In 1920s Georgia, Willie Perryman followed his older brother Rufus in becoming a blues piano player: both were albino Negroes with pale skin, reddish hair and poor eyesight. Rufus was already well established as \"Speckled Red\", Willie became \"Piano Red\". The piano player and guitarist Tampa Red from the same state developed his career in Chicago, Illinois, at that time: his name may have come from his light skin tone, or possibly reddish hair.\n\nMore recently such categorization has been noted in the Caribbean. It is reported that skin tones play an important role in defining how Barbadians view one another, and they use terms such as \"brown skin, light skin, fair skin, high brown, red, and mulatto\". An assessment of racism in Trinidad notes people often being described by their skin tone, with the gradations being \"HIGH RED – part White, part Black but ‘clearer’ than Brown-skin: HIGH BROWN – More white than Black, light skinned: DOUGLA –part Indian and part Black: LIGHT SKINNED, or CLEAR SKINNED Some Black, but more White: TRINI WHITE – Perhaps not all White, behaves like others but skin White\". In Jamaica albinism has been stigmatized, but the albino dancehall singer Yellowman took his stage name in protest against such prejudice and has helped to end this stereotype. The West Indian region uses the term \"coolie\" for all people of east Indian descent. In Trinidad, however, use of the term is considered extremely offensive.\n\nIn Russia, persons of Caucasus descent are often referred to as White (not because of skin color). \"White\", apart from its racial meaning, is also a term denoting opponents of the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and \"Red\", apart from its racial meaning, symbolizes communism (or communists), or refers to the Bolsheviks, while \"Green\" often refers to ecologists.\n\nHuang (yellow) is a common surname, but does not refer to the East Asian race as was popular in western languages until recently. However, the Yellow Emperor was a legendary founder of China. Yellow is also identified with the \"center\" cardinal direction (blue-east, red-south, white-west, black-north) while China is known as Zhongguo \"middle kingdom\".\n\nWhite (白 \"bai\") means \"plain\" or \"free of charge\" in many common expressions and was not traditionally used to refer to Europeans or descendants, who were usually identified as \"洋人\" (yáng rén, \"people from [across the] ocean\") or some variety of \"barbarians\" with reddish or pinkish skin colors (e.g. Minnan \"ang mo\", \"red-haired\" or Cantonese \"gwei lo\", \"ghost man\"). Contemporary Chinese, has, however, adopted Western usage to some extent. Black (黑 \"hei\") is typically applied to those of African race today. However, the term \"black resident\" (黑户) also refers to unregistered rural migrants in cities (as in \"black market\"). The word 白 (white), when used under certain contexts, is offensive, taking on a meaning extended from \"plain\" to \"uneducated\" and \"uncultured\".\n\nNames of ethnic minorities sometimes contain colors, not to indicate skin color, but simply for identification, possibly based on traditional clothing or geographical direction.\n\nThe Five Races Under One Union theory of national unity can be visualized through an : Red - Han, Yellow - Manchu, Blue - Mongol, White - Hui and Black - Tibetan.\n\nThe word \"인종\" (\"injong\") is used when describing a person's race, which also incorporates his or her skin color.\n\"백\" (\"baek\"; White), used with \"인\" (\"in\"; person) to make \"백인\" (\"baegin\"), literally means \"white person\" in Korean. \"흑\" (\"heuk\") is used to describe persons of African descent, it literally means \"black\" in hanja. \"흑인\" (\"heugin\") thus means \"black person\".\n\nThe on'yomi reading of \"人\" (\"jin\") is often used as a suffix to describe a person's nationality, amongst other things.\nIt is also not uncommonly used with the on'yomi readings of \"白\" (\"haku\"; white) and \"黒\" (\"koku\"; black) to form \"白人\" (\"hakujin\"; white person) and 黒人 (\"kokujin\"; black person).\n\nThe five cardinal directions were historically identified with colors. This was common to the Central Asian cultural area and was carried west by the westward migration of the Turks. These directional color terms were applied both to geographic features and sometimes to populations as well.\n\nRacial segregation in the United States was based on a binary classification, white vs. non-white, in which \"white\" was held to imply \"purity\" so that anyone with even the slightest amount of non-white ancestry was excluded from white privileges, and there could be no category of racially mixed people. In 1896 this doctrine was upheld in the \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" Supreme Court case. Traditionally the main distinction was between \"white\" and \"black\", but Japanese Americans could be accepted on both sides of the divide. As further racial groups were categorized, \"white\" became narrowly construed, and everyone else was categorised as a \"person of color\", suggesting that \"white\" people have no race, while racial subdivision of those \"of color\" was unimportant.\n\nAt college campus protests during the 1960s, a \"Flag of the Races\" was in use, with five stripes comprising red, black, brown, yellow, and white tones.\n\nIn the 2000 United States Census, two of the five self-designated races are labeled by a color. In the 2000 US Census, \"White\" refers to \"person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\" In the 2000 US Census, \"Black or African American\" refers to a \"person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.\" The other three self-designated races are not labeled by color.\n\n"}
{"id": "2019701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019701", "title": "Gudgeon", "text": "Gudgeon\n\nA gudgeon is a socket-like, cylindrical (i.e., \"female\") fitting attached to one component to enable a pivoting or hinging connection to a second component. The second component carries a pintle fitting, the male counterpart to the gudgeon, enabling an interpivoting connection that can be easily separated. Designs that may use gudgeon and pintle connections include hinges, shutters and boat rudders.\n\nThe \"gudgeon\" derives from the Middle English \"gojoun\", which originated from the Middle French \"goujon\". Its first known use was in the 15th century.\n\nA winged gudgeon is one that has extensions that increase its ability to adhere to the fixed surface. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, winged gudgeons were used to support water wheel shafts, and later, steam engine shafts.\n\nIn engines, a gudgeon pin (UK, wrist pin US) joins the small end of a connecting rod to a piston or crosshead.\n\nIn buildings pintles and gudgeons are used for working shutters. Shutters were traditionally used to protect the glazing as well as help keep heat in the building at night during the colder months. Shutters are experiencing a comeback as protection from wind-borne storm debris. Architects have made use of both reclaimed historical shutter hardware as well as used stainless sailing hardware for new projects. Other uses are closet doors, barn doors, storm doors, etc. All uses require hold backs of some sort to keep shutter or door from \"flapping in the wind\".\n\nIn sailing, pintles insert into gudgeons that are normally affixed to the transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder slides, lowers or clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot clevis pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons are attached to the rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a \"Rudder Stop\").\nReally good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as \"consumable\".\n\nOn some boats there are split pins/split rings through the pintail to stop gudgeons lifting. In addition while the bottom fitting is a gudgeon turning on a pintail the upper two fittings are a pair of gudgeons each with a pin joining them with split pin/washer to stop them coming out.\n\nIn navigations locks, the upper pivot point for a miter gate is referred to as the gudgeon, and carries horizontal loads caused by a gate leaf hanging with no water load. The lower pivot, which carries the weight of the leaf, is referred to as the pintle.\n\n"}

He first started playing when he came across a Spanish guitar that his sister owned. The album that initially influenced him to pursue a career in music was \"The Story of the Clash, Volume 1\", which he heard when he was 12. Prior to joining Suede, Oakes played in a band called \"TED\" along with his friends Peter Field (vocals) and Colin Forbes (Rhythm guitar). The band was actually originally titled 'PIPATED' – 'Plug in Peter and the Electric Daffodils'.\n\nThe first gig Oakes attended was one of Suede's at the Poole Arts Centre in May 1993. Upon hearing that guitarist Bernard Butler had left the band and that the band were auditioning for a replacement, he recorded versions of Suede songs and some of his own material on a 4 track recorder, which he sent to the band's fanclub along with a note that read \"Take me or leave me.\" When drummer Simon Gilbert heard Anderson playing back the tape whilst going through audition tapes, he mistakenly believed it to be an early Suede demo. After the second audition Oakes was invited to join the band.\n\nAt the age of 17, and after beating approximately five hundred candidates, Oakes officially joined Suede on 17 September 1994 (exactly 2 weeks before his 18th birthday). Oakes first public appearance with the band was on \"Top of the Pops\", while his first full live appearance was at a secret fan club gig at London's Raw Club on 10 October 1994. The first song he performed live, and the first video he appeared in, was \"We are the Pigs\".\n\nHis first co-writing credits were the B-sides of single \"New Generation\", \"Together\" and \"Bentswood Boys\". Oakes went on to co-write many songs with Anderson on subsequent albums and B-side material, several of which went on to become hit singles in the UK.\n\nOakes joined his former bandmates for three UK Suede concerts in 2010, followed by a concert at London's O2 Arena in December of that year, then festival appearances in Sweden, Hultsfredsfestivalen in July and Denmark and Norway in August. Suedes's reunion continued with their sixth album, \"Bloodsports\", on which Oakes co-wrote all but two of the songs, released in March 2013.\n\nSuede released their seventh album \"Night Thoughts\" on 22 January 2016 to widespread critical acclaim. Oakes co-wrote all but four of the songs. It was accompanied by a feature film, directed by Roger Sargent. During their 2016 tour the band performed the first half of their set from behind a screen onto which Sargent's film was projected.\n\nArtmagic is a duo formed by Oakes and producer/singer Sean McGhee in 2008. Their debut EP, \"I Keep on Walking\", was released on 23 May 2011, followed by a single, \"Forever in Negative\" on 25 June 2012. Their debut album, \"Become The One You Love\", was released on 2 July 2012. A further single, \"Down in the River\" followed on 21 October 2012.\n\nA new song, \"Sing For The Snowfall\" was released on Christmas Day 2017.

{"id": "2019724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019724", "title": "Caliber Comics", "text": "Caliber Comics\n\nCaliber Comics or Caliber Press is an American comic book publisher founded in 1989 by Gary Reed. Featuring primarily creator-owned comics, Caliber published over 1,300 comics in the decade following its inception and is ranked as one of America's leading independent publishers. Caliber ceased publishing in 2000, but resumed operations in 2015. Reed died suddenly in 2016, but the company has continued publishing.\n\nGary Reed, who previously owned a chain of bookstores, began publishing with the release of two titles acquired from Arrow Comics—\"Deadworld\" and \"The Realm\". Other initial launches included \"Caliber Presents\", featuring the work of Vince Locke, Mark Bloodworth, Tim Vigil, James O'Barr, and Guy Davis; the first issue of \"Baker Street\", co-created by Reed and Guy Davis; and the initial appearance of O’Barr’s \"The Crow\".\n\nReed arranged with \"Pocket Classics\", a series of illustrated books similar in design to Classics Illustrated, to be released to the direct market via Caliber Press. Over forty titles were distributed. The interest in literary works continued for Caliber when in 1991 the new imprint Tome Press was launched. Tome featured historical and biographical material in addition to literature. Over 65 different Tome Press titles would be released on subjects as diverse as the Russian Revolution, The Alamo, Amelia Earhart, El Cid, Jack London stories, reprints of classic art print series, and dozens of others.\n\nAfter its initial launch, Caliber expanded by bringing in new creators and projects. Jim Calafiore was first published with his graphic novella, \"Progeny\". In \"Grafik Muzik\", Mike Allred introduced his Madman character, Kevin VanHook's \"Frost\" series which was the storyline for the film released in 2002, Ted Slampyak's \"Jazz Age Chronicles\", Philip Hester's \"Fringe\", Stuart Immonen's \"Playground\", John Bergin's \"Ashes\", and other titles such as \"Go-Man\", \"Northguard\", \"Varcel's Vixens\", and more.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Caliber launched three new imprints, Gauntlet and Iconografix. Gauntlet was an action-based line whose leading titles were \"U.N. Force\", \"Berzerker\" (featuring work from Rob Liefeld and Angel Medina), Patrick Zircher's \"Samurai Seven\", and \"Serpent Rising\" (based on the stage play). Iconografix dealt with more obscure and cutting-edge material that included humor comics as well as comics often referred to as the \"slice of life.\" Included here were the first issues of Ed Brubaker's \"Lowlife\", \"Meatcake\" from Dame Darcy, \"Bound & Gagged\" from Michael Aushenker, and a number of projects from Dave Cooper, Jason Lutes, and Matt Howarth.\n\nCaliber had ventured into licensed comics with their early release of \"Moontrap\", the science fiction film starring Star Trek's Walter Koenig, and the production of a comic for Troma Films called \"\"; but it was the full-color adaptation of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", written and drawn by Kevin VanHook that proved the most successful.\n\nAnother licensed property was Mechanoid Invasion, a 1981 RPG from Palladium Books made into a 3-book comic called The Mechanoids beginning in Spring 1991. Another comic property affiliated with Caliber called Justice Machine had also been adapted into a Heroes Unlimited sourcebook by Palladium. This was based on the original Noble Comics version by Gustovich in 1981, while Caliber distributed the New Justice Machine sequel by Ellis from 1989.\n\nThe expansion of Caliber continued with projects including Michael Lark's \"Airwaves\", \"Silencers\" from Mark Askwith and R. G. Taylor, and \"Negative Burn\", the anthology title that would run for 50 issues and was picked up by Desperado Publishing.\n\nIn late 1993, Caliber merged with the Stabur Corporation. Reed became president of Stabur as well as staying on with Caliber. Caliber began to produce special comics for Wal-Mart, including the series \"Big Bang Comics\" (which later would have a long run at Image Comics), \"Stormquest\", and a number of literary adaptations, including a version of \"Frankenstein\". Caliber also produced some records and a specialty magazine, \"ARC\", for distribution outside comics.\n\nIn 1993, the principles of Stabur were involved in starting up a new toy company with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane. Reed was named vice president of McFarlane Toys while still running Stabur and Caliber. Jim Pruett was hired to take over some of the editorial duties of Caliber. Reed would stay with McFarlane Toys until May 1996.\n\nCaliber expanded in the mid-1990s with titles such as David Mack's \"Kabuki\", Brian Bendis' \"A.K.A. Goldfish\" and \"Jinx\", Mark Ricketts' \"Nowheresville\", Mike Carey and Michael Gaydos on \"Inferno\", and in 1995, Caliber launched the sub-imprint of New Worlds. New Worlds' titles were loosely connected, and included \"Raven Chronicles\", \"Helsing\", \"Seeker\", \"Saint Germaine\", \"Red Diaries\", \"Black Mist\", and others. Although not an actual shared universe, the settings and characters could cross over with each other and often did.\n\nAs Caliber expanded, more editorial staff was hired to handle the growing line of comics. Moebius Comics launched and fan favorites \"Mr. Monster\" and \"Maze Agency\" returned. Caliber handled the distribution of Amazing Comics, which featured the work of Mike Deodato. \"Brian Lumley's Necroscope\" and Whitley Strieber's \"Communion\" series were signed on for comic releases. \"Jon Sable\" from Mike Grell was announced but never came out. Caliber also started a new imprint in 1997, Tapestry Comics, that featured an \"all ages\" approach.\n\nAs the overall comic market declined with the consolidation of the distribution system, Caliber slowly cut back on the number of titles. Caliber found some success of producing comics that appealed outside the usual comics market with some of the Tome Press titles including the \"Sherlock Holmes Reader\", which had the majority of its sales outside the traditional comic stores.\n\nThe demise of Caliber can be attributed primarily to the problems associated with the Spawn PowerCardz game. Caliber had invested heavily in time and money to launch the collectible card game and had great potential with purchase orders. However, the printer of the card game was running behind in production and outsourced the collation of the game to another printer who didn't understand the random assortment of the cards. When the game appeared with improper collation, the purchase orders, which exceeded over two million dollars, were cancelled. Although a lawsuit was filed and Caliber won, by the time the judgment came, it was too late. In addition, the printer declared bankruptcy and Caliber was left only with portions of the unusable product.\n\nIn 2000, Caliber released the last of its titles, and Gary Reed moved on to concentrate on teaching college biology and freelance writing. Many of Caliber's top titles continued on with new publishers, including \"Baker Street\", \"Deadworld\", \"Saint Germaine\", \"Kilroy Is Here\", \"Negative Burn\", \"Raven Chronicles\", and \"Red Diaries\".

It also reached the top 20 in Denmark and Spain and peaked at number 50 in Ireland. Some critics viewed the single as an improvement from the group's 2002 album \"A New Morning\", which was considered to be a disappointing album.\n\nThe song was better received than Suede's previous efforts from \"A New Morning\". John Murphy of \"musicOMH\" wrote that \"'Attitude' is one of their best tunes for years.\" Adding that it's \"the perfect reminder as to why Suede were one of the most intriguing bands of the '90s.\" Simon Donohue of the \"Manchester Evening News\" contrasted the song with the band’s popular singles “Beautiful Ones” and “Animal Nitrate”, writing: “This on the other hand is vaguely experimental and almost retro in its approach. But as ever, Anderson's dulcet tones are unmistakable.” Chris Heath of \"Dotmusic\" rated the song seven out of ten, saying: \"the staccato bass-heavy rumblings - which might have found a slot on \"Coming Up\" - are far preferable to some of the band's weaker moments.\"\n\nTwo versions of a video were made for \"Attitude\", directed by Lindy Heymann.

Other members included Curtis Fried, Gordon Javna, Jon Yaffee, and guitarist/violinist David Mansfield. The band had a modest local following in northern New Jersey and was the opening act for Gram Parsons at Max's Kansas City in New York. Their music was oriented towards lighthearted, catchy songs. The group's name evoked, as \"People\" magazine commented, \"a line of bathtub toys\".\n\nThe band was signed by Warner Bros. Records for $75,000 and released the album \"Media Push\" in 1974. The single \"The Barnyard Song\" received a smattering of airplay on WNEW-FM and the band had a national television appearance on \"The Mike Douglas Show\". Nevertheless, they failed to gain a substantial audience and were dropped by Warner Bros.\n\nMansfield went on to a very successful career with Bob Dylan, The Alpha Band, and as a session musician and composer. The failure of Quacky Duck helped convince Danny Bennett that his talents lay more in business than in being a musician; as a result he later became Tony Bennett's manager and played a key role in resurrecting his father's commercial career in the 1980s and early 1990s. Dae Bennett went on to become a recording engineer. Gordon Javna became a writer and editor and oversees the popular \"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader\" series of trivia books.

Hartley Hare, Pig, Topov and the gang were the stars of ATV's pre-school series which ran from January 1973 to 29 December 1981.\n\n\"Pipkins\" was one of the first children's programmes on British TV where the characters had regional accents: Pig had a Birmingham accent, while Topov the monkey was a Cockney and Octavia the ostrich had a French accent.\n\nIn 1972, the ITV network expanded its daytime broadcasting hours and the Independent Broadcasting Authority commissioned four of the main ITV companies to each provide a series of interest to pre-schoolers, as an alternative to the successful US import \"Sesame Street\". From this commission Thames Television came up with \"Rainbow\", Yorkshire with \"Mister Trimble\", Granada with \"Hickory House\", while ATV’s contribution would be \"Inigo Pipkin\".\n\n\"Inigo Pipkin\" was first shown on New Year's Day 1973. When the show started, the main character was an elderly puppet maker called Inigo Pipkin (hence the original title), played by George Woodbridge. The puppets were his creations, and over the course of the first series, viewers saw Inigo bring to life Hartley Hare and the Tortoise (a.k.a. George) played by Nigel Plaskitt; and Topov the monkey, Pig and Octavia the ostrich, all played by Heather Tobias.\n\nHowever, Woodbridge died suddenly from a heart attack in March 1973, while recording of the second series was still taking place. \"Inigo Pipkin\" was not recorded in the order it was transmitted, and Woodbridge had only completed taping of the latter episodes. The scripts for the episodes that would be broadcast first in the transmission run, i.e. those that Woodbridge had not managed to record, were thus hastily rewritten, with Inigo's absence explained by his being away on a fishing holiday.\n\nIn 1974, in a first for children's television, the death of Inigo was worked into the programme, predating the Mr Hooper episode on \"Sesame Street\" by nine years. From this episode onwards, the show was renamed \"Pipkins\" and Inigo's assistant, Johnny (Wayne Laryea), took over. The direction of the programme had to change; from here on, the show ceased to centre around a puppet workshop and the characters became the 'Help People', helping anyone in need of a hand. Similarly, another episode \"Death of a Goldfish\" dealt with the topic of death, in regards to losing a pet. Topov the monkey and Johnny discussed why the goldfish died and why do people die?\n\nJohnny left \"Pipkins\" around 1978, to be replaced by Tom (Jonathan Kydd), who moved on in 1980, his place taken by Peter Potter (Paddy O'Hagan). In later years Sue Nicholls made regular appearances as the Pipkins' neighbour, Mrs Muddle. The name was somewhat ironic as she was always a calming, self-assured presence around the puppets.\n\nThe familiar workshop set was replaced in 1979 (in the story \"Moving Out\"), with new interiors based around a kitchen and backyard. The new set was built up from ground level to enable puppeteers to work standing up and to move around more freely, modelled on the methods used by \"The Muppet Show\" which was also filmed at ATV's Elstree Studios.\n\n\"Pipkins\" ended when ATV lost its franchise for the Midlands ITV region, was restructured and became Central Independent Television. The programme was replaced by \"Let's Pretend\".\n\nThe series was made at ATV's Elstree studios, with occasional filming on location. For the \"Inigo Pipkin\" episodes, the opening and closing titles were sung by Jackie Lee, who had earlier sung the themes to children's programmes \"The Adventures of Rupert Bear\" and \"White Horses\".\n\nUnusually for a children's programme, there was no spin-off \"Pipkins\" merchandise (toys, games, books etc.) produced during the programme's run.\n\nIn common with other 1970s shows, several \"Pipkins\" episodes recorded on 625 line PAL Colour Videotape — including the very first \"Inigo Pipkin\" — are missing from the archives (poor storage of former ATV master colour videotapes has led to the loss of many shows), and not even any 16mm Black & White Film copies of the lost episodes exist.\n\nOut of a total of 333 episodes, only 136 have survived. The other 197 episodes no longer exist in any format, while two others exist on 625 line PAL Colour Videotape only as incomplete copies (possibly due to videotape damage caused by poor storage). Nigel Plaskitt — who provided the show's narration, as well as voicing and operating Hartley and Tortoise — made off-air domestic videocassette recordings of around 56 episodes, now the only format in which these are known to exist, and some have been used for the DVD release in the UK.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2019765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019765", "title": "Ribble Link", "text": "Ribble Link\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link is a linear water park and new navigation which links the once-isolated Lancaster Canal in Lancashire, England to the River Ribble. It was opened in July 2002.\n\nThe marshland of the River Ribble and the Savick Brook were natural obstacles preventing easy access north-west of Preston. Before the private toll road and modern roads A583/A584 were built crossing the marsh and the brook would have been much further inland, north-east of the present crossing and supportive evidence is this may have been at what is now the footbridge at Lea Golf Course. On the first 1840 Ordnance map this is called Wads Bridge but more importantly also shows a ford. This route also leads south to St Catherines Well on Lea Marsh, suggesting a route of pilgrimage and antiquity. The route north avoiding the marsh and toll road leads to the now much quieter lanes leading to the village of Clifton, which was at one time the main thoroughfare to Kirkham and the west.\n\nBefore canalisation the Savick Brook was a shallow meandering watercourse and transversing the brook was much easier in several places, formal by bridges and informal where it could simply be waded across. The Savick Brook with its fresh water and considerable fish population was an important local resource, in history and more recently into the 20th Century.\n\nThe Savick Brook, perhaps originally spelt Savock separated the local parish of Lea which after Domesday (1086) was separated as Norman or French Lea to the south while English Lea was to the north.\n\nThe Savick Brook has drained the hinterland for some considerable distance, being one of many brooks and streams that drains down from the foothills of the Pennines. Indeed, a new private toll road across the marsh was built with the toll being paid at Lea Gate, hence its name. This is now the Ribble Link bridge under the A583 Blackpool Road. No charge is now levied.\n\nThe Savick Brook by its very nature has altered course over every year and over millennia due to the structure of the land and flooded into the adjoining field systems, as a floodplain.\n\nAs part of the construction of the Ribble Link, an archeological evaluation took place to establish whether any important archeological sites would be disturbed by the new waterway.\nThe evaluation found signs that there could have been an old mill at Lock 8 and evidence of a ridge and furrow field system and likely to be disturbed in part by the construction. Once gain local people refer to this field as 'the Mill Field'. This is what the evaluation said about the area:\n\n\"The preliminary assessment of the archaeological potential along the line of the Ribble Link Navigation identified Mill Field as an area in which significant features, essentially a water mill, may have been located. The evaluation established that the field contained the abraded remains of a ridge and furrow field system. This feature partially survived as indistinct, but identifiable, earthworks covering the centre of the field. The remains of furrows found within the excavation trenches indicated that the field system originally covered a greater area. The evaluation indicated that the construction of the navigation should not conflict with the area in which the ridge and furrow survived as earthworks. However, the area where the field system was known to survive only as subsurface features would be affected by the excavations for the navigations. It may be possible to locate the eastern and western boundary ditches to the field system, if they exist, during the construction work.\"\n\nSevere flooding of the Millennium Ribble Link took place in 2003/2004 causing severe sedimentation to the channel and scour to by-wash weirs resulting in the Ribble Link becoming un-navigable. There was limited water supply due to major works on the Lancaster Canal. Ironically the site was subjected to severe flooding during remedial works. Remedial costs were £124,576.00.\n\nThe Ribble Link was closed again in 2006 after £600,000 was spent on dredging and 'repairs'.\n\nThe Savick Brook was known to be tidal as far as Haslam Park, what is now the bottom of the 3 lock staircase.\n\nAs with all brooks entering the salt water sea, it was a breeding ground for flatfish. Other migratory fish are known to have used the Savick Brook to reach their spawning grounds.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link was built with locks and straightened leaving the original meanders of the Savick Brook, but only by constructing over-flow weirs at each lock allowing water to continue to flow through the Savick Brook. Fish passes were built into these weirs to allow fish passage.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link includes what was Great Britain's first inland waterway to be constructed in nearly 100 years when it was opened in July 2002, and was the first to be built for leisure purposes only, not commercial use. It is a navigation – it is not a canal as boats can only travel in one direction on alternate days, The link connects the once-isolated Lancaster Canal to the River Ribble. From the Ribble it is possible to reach the main navigable system via the River Douglas and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal's Rufford Branch subject to tides and weather conditions.\n\nFrom the north; the Northern end of the Millennium Ribble Link is a holding basin adjacent and connected to the Lancaster Canal. This is the start of the sculpture trail. This is followed by a 3 lock staircase and a 'turning circle' at the bottom, the Savick Brook enters from the east. To the south of this is the fine Victorian Haslam Park and well worth a visit if travelling by foot. A pedestrian footpath and cycle path is clearly marked. The link itself turns west following the line of the original Savick Brook.\n\nPassing under Tom Benson Way, and immediately under the local railway line bridge the Ribble Link comes to Lock 4 with a weir. The sculpture 'Fire' by Thompson Dagnall is found here. From Lock 4 to Lock 5, complete with weir, to the north is a quiet public park, again worth visiting on foot or bicycle. Between Locks 4 and 5, to the south is the 'hay meadow' part of the Ribble Link Development, identified as 'national significance'. Public access is approved and welcomed.\n\nLock 5 is separated from the meander of the Savick Brook by an island created by the line of the new canal and the Savick Brook joins again just after leaving Lock 5. The sculpture 'Air' by Thompson Dagnall is found above and to the south of Lock 5.\n\nPassing under Lea Road the Ribble Link enters the flood plain of semi urban area with agricultural fields on either side. This leads to Lock 6, with weir and then under Tudor Avenue bridge. On the left is the local city soccer team's training ground, Preston North End Football Club. On the right is Ashton and Lea Golf Club. Then passing under a footbridge, possibly of ancient origin, Lock 7 and weir appears. Again separated from the meander of the Savick Brook the Ribble Link passes through agricultural fields, under Goodier Bridge to the Holding Basin at Lock 8. Floating pontoons are available for mooring.\n\nAfter Lock 8 the navigation becomes tidal. There is Savick Brook Pumping Station on the left followed by a copse of semi-ancient woodland and a Biological Heritage Site reedbed at Savick Bridge, which is the main A583 road. The sculpture 'Rook' by Thompson Dagnall can be seen perched on the north bank. It is also visible if travelling by car along the A583.\n\nDown to the rotating sealock at Lock 9 and into the River Ribble and turning west on to the River Douglas and beyond. From the south, reverse the description.\n\nFrom the outset the project was to be far more than 'just a canal', it included the provision of\na) community boat\nb) outdoor classroom\nc) visitor seating\nd) footbridge downstream of lock 7 & wetland scrape for birds\ne) public access and enjoyment\nf) natural habitat creation and enhancement\nand; Improve access to the canal and enhance the visitor experience and provide an increase in economic benefits to the local community.\nAs a consequence the scheme includes a 'sculpture trail' along the length of the Millennium Ribble Link.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link is only open for approximately 90 days out of 365; approximately 200 boats a year have used the Ribble Link since its opening.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link was built to celebrate the Millennium (the year 2000), and cost £6.54 million, of which just over £3 million was a grant from the Millennium Commission. The remaining £3.54 million was mainly from public funds.\n\nOriginally estimated at £3.7 million the total construction costs increased on a regular basis to £5.6 million (£5,595,138 on 10 August 2000 to be precise) and finally overspent by an additional £1.1 million (British Waterways contributed £510,000 towards that over spend). Originally £850,000 was set aside, primarily from Lancashire Waste Services Limited landfill tax credits for 125 years of maintenance. All of The Waterways Trust maintenance budget was used to fund the original over-spend and the period of maintenance reduced to 40 years.\n\nBritish Waterways have spent over £2.1million on maintenance and keeping the navigation open in the first five years of operation. Over £600,000 was spent on winter maintenance and dredging in 2006.\n\nAnnual dredging is required to keep the Millennium Ribble Link navigable.\n\n\"Following its success BW will be reapplying for further licences to carry out annual ‘cutter suction’ dredging to remove the build-up of silt that is brought into the Ribble Link throughout the course of a normal boating season.\"\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts of The Waterways Trust show a maintenance expenditure on the Ribble Link of £22,200 in 2005/6 from an income of £3,186,521 and £29,000 in 2006/7 from an income of £4,235,471.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link is only open for approximately 90 days out of 365, therefore closed for 270 days. Approximately 200 boats a year have used the Ribble Link since its opening. It was closed in 2003/4 and 2006/7 for dredging, repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe cost of annual dredging, a well known problem, closed Preston Docks in October 1981.\n\nThe Savick Brook/Ribble Link is situated in an area subject to a high flood risk according to the Environment Agency. There is also a flood risk further upstream of the Savick Brook east of the A6 main road at Fulwood, Preston. This appear to be supported as the Ribble Link was closed in 2003/4 and 2006/7 for 'maintenance and repairs' after flooding.\n\nPreston City Council has a specific policy on flooding which states \"\"It is important that there must be no increase in rates of surface run-off to both the Savick Brook and Sharoe Brook catchments, because this could result in localised flooding further downstream. The Environment Agency has stressed the importance of ensuring that run-off from the industrial sites at Red Scar must not exceed levels to prevent the risk of flooding elsewhere\"\" i.e. Savick Brook/Ribble Link indicative of the high flood risk to the Millennium Ribble Link.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link is also subject to a number of local planning conditions and identified in the adopted local plan as a 'wildlife corridor'.\n\nBoth the River Ribble and Savick Brook/Ribble Link are subject to outfall from a number of sources, one being the nuclear facility at Springfield nearby. The University of Portsmouth established the Ribble estuary has often failed its Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) values for a number of metals and certain organic and organo-metallic compounds (e.g. TBT). Presently, monitoring is conducted monthly by the Environment Agency. A public version of 'Radiological Habits Survey 2006' supported by the Environment Agency, Food Standards Agency and Health and Executive is available which included 'recreational activities', i.e. The Millennium Ribble Link, in the vicinity of Springfield Fuels Limited, Westinghouse site near Preston Lancashire.\n\nWhen originally planned, the Lancaster Canal would have crossed the River Lune and the River Ribble on aqueducts, and it was intended that there should be a link to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal near Chorley. The Lune aqueduct was built, but the Ribble one was not, as the construction was well over budget by the time the canal reached Preston. The canal link was eventually replaced by a tramway link, crossing the Ribble on a timber bridge. The bridge outlasted the tramway, and it was not until the 1960s that it was demolished and replaced by a new pedestrian bridge, made of concrete beams but designed to look like the old timber structure. The Lancaster Canal remained isolated from the rest of the English Canal network.\n\nThe idea of building a connecting link along the Savick Brook was first proposed in 1979 by John Whittaker of the Lancaster Canal Boat Club. The Ribble Link Trust was set up in 1984, in order to promote the idea, and a series of annual cruises were held, starting at Tarleton on the Leeds and Liverpool Rufford Branch, passing down the River Douglas, up the River Ribble and ending at Preston Dock. These cruises raised awareness of the proposed link, and also demonstrated that canal boats could navigate on this section of tidal water without difficulty.\n\nThe original route for the scheme utilised the Sharoe Brook and Haslam Park, but there were considerable difficulties with land ownership and permissions. These remained a permanent problem. In 2007, five years after opening, the leases had still not been completed. The junction with the Lancaster Canal required a flight of locks in a tight location, and it was originally intended to have one lock to the south of the Brook, which would then be crossed by an aqueduct leading to a 2-rise staircase. This configuration was replaced by a 3-rise staircase, with a turning basin to enable boats to negotiate the extremely sharp left hand turn at the bottom of the flight. Because of the tidal nature of the Savick Brook, it was decided at the early stages of planning that the link would be designed for one way operation.\n\nThere were constant delays and frustrations, while costs escalated. The project was further complicated as in 2000 \"\"British Waterways are constrained by their statutory responsibilities from taking on additional liabilities or spending money on Waterways not within their current responsibilities. British Waterways must be able to satisfy the Department of Environment Transport and Regions that any involvement is within this principle. The Waterways Trust is a new organisation and currently doesn't have either the funds or track record to make absolute commitments\"\". There was considerable concern that the project would not proceed and the Millennium Commission Funding would be lost. The original contractors were replaced under much angst and debate over fees.\n\nThe contract for the construction was awarded to the civil engineers Gleeson in November 2000, with Arup Water responsible for the detailed design. A partnership between British Waterways, Lancashire County Council, the Ribble Link Trust and The Waterways Trust were responsible for the management of the scheme. A separate company The Ribble Link Construction and Operation Limited was set up.\n\nThe Millennium Commission agreed to fund the Millennium Ribble Link as a community project for a linear water park that included \"\"such things as landscaping, artworks, heritage interpretation, foot and cycle paths, habitat creation and nature areas... something millennial and not just 5 miles of canal\"\".\n\nFunding of £75,000 secured from the Millennium Commission for a community boat for the Millennium Ribble Link for use by the local community for educational purposes enabled the purchase of a tip boat, which was taken to the Nantwich Canal Centre for refurbishment and to be made accessible for wheelchairs. She was renamed ‘Millennium Swiftsure’, a name derived from a 19th-century packet boat, part of the original passenger carrying service that ran on the Lancaster Canal for many years after the introduction of trains. The Millennium Swiftsure was subsequently never used on the Millennium Ribble Link and moved to Lancaster to be used as a water taxi.\n\nThroughout the development 'Angling' was seen and promoted as a beneficiary of the scheme, as fishing had been a traditional pastime on the Savick Brook. The Millennium Ribble Link is one of the very few water courses in the UK where Fishing is not allowed. British Waterways do not allow angling on the Millennium Ribble Link.\n\nLWS Lancashire Environmental Fund – \"\"the contribution (£250,000) is intended to support wider public amenity elements of the proposal, such as public access and enhanced natural habitats.\"\" ... \"\"acknowledge the support of the Fund (using the full title \"LWS Lancashire Environmental Fund' in any ... appropriate materials\"\"\n\nThe Millennium Commission contributed £3,300 for Visitor Seating for enhancement and enjoyment, commissioned from recycled materials and installed in 2007. Lancashire County Council contributed £80,000 to tarmac the cycle route along part of the Millennium Ribble Link, from Tudor Avenue to the Lancaster Canal and connect with the national cycle network.\n\nAn important piece of land, a traditional hay meadow, adjoining the Savick Brook either side of Savick Way, between Locks 4 and 5, was identified as MG4 classification of 'national, county and local significance'.\n\nThe Millennium Commission provided a £30,000 grant for public enjoyment and enhancement of the hay meadow.\n\n\"\"The (Millennium) Commission is to be satisfied in all respects regarding the operation and future maintenance of the hay meadow element of the Enhancement Project. A deed of dedication is to be provided by Preston Borough Council to the Commission's satisfaction prior to the release of any Enhancement Project Grant\". \".\n\nBritish Waterways used the £30,000 grant to replace the perimeter fencing with a new 'recycled material' fence.\nRepairs, required where dredging vehicles access was required have been made using traditional wood.\n\nA public Right of way, Footpath 70 from Lea Road, adjacent to the Ribble Link across the hay meadow and at one time under the railway line but was terminated west of the Railway Line when Tom Benson Way was constructed and the tunnel enclosed.\n\nOriginally an outdoor school classroom was part of the development and located along the Millennium Ribble Link, incorporating the hay meadow. This was subsequently amended to be included inside the grounds of the local primary school by moving the perimeter fence. \"\"The creation of the Link was not only for the sole purpose of the boating community, it was also created to add additional dimensions to meet the aspirations of the local community.\"\"\n\nThe outdoor classroom at Ashton Primary School features three carved wooden benches and an information board telling pupils about wildlife on the canal.\n\nThe hay meadow created nearby will provide a haven for wildflowers and insects.\n\nThe Ribble Millennium Link is underneath the flight path of Warton Aerodrome and one may see civilian and military aircraft passing overhead. It can be quite noisy at times.\n\nThe Banded Demoiselle, one of the largest and most colourful of the damselflies, has long been known from the Cuerden Valley Park. For many years this was thought to be its only Lancashire locality. However, during the late 1990s a considerable expansion of its range took place. The insect reached Savick Brook, west of Preston, in 1997 and, by 1999, was well established there. In 1998, it was recorded on the Lancaster Canal north of Preston and also on the Leeds-Liverpool canal at Withnell Fold.\n\nAnnual dredging of the Ribble Link may affect these insects.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link has much to see and enjoy, including flora and fauna including many different butterflies.\n\nGround clearance began in February and March 2001, with the intention of constructing the lower end of the navigation first, but the outbreak of Foot-and-mouth disease in May 2001 resulted in all of the surrounding agricultural land being closed for access, and there was no option but to start at the top. Work began on lock 5 first, followed by lock 4. Both were built on dry ground between the sides of a meander. The design involved driving four rows of interlocking steel piles into the ground, using a vibrating pile driver to minimise the noise nuisance which is normally associated with hammer action pile driving. The inner two rows would form the lock walls, while the outer two were tied to them by steel tie rods to provide anchorage. Earth was then excavated from between the inner pair to form the lock chamber. Construction of the staircase began soon afterwards, which was the first staircase ever built by machine, and getting the profile of the piles correct required new skills which were developed on the project. The Foot-and-mouth restrictions were lifted in July 2001, and work on the lower section could start.\n\nIn August 2001, there was some concern about a number of tight bends, and trials with a measuring rod resulted in some of them having to be re-aligned. The navigation had been designed with massive weirs near all the locks, to cope with a 1 in 50 year flood level, but before they were constructed, prolonged heavy rain in late August resulted in extensive flooding, causing significant damage to the newly built banks, which were washed into the channel. A second flood occurred in mid-September, and a third on 8 October, all of which resulted in work having to be re-done. Lock 6 was the only lock which had to be built on the line of the Brook, and so the water had to be diverted around the site in pipes while the initial piling was completed.\n\nThe lock gates were built at the Northwich works of British Waterways, and the first pair to be fitted were the upper gates of lock 5, in late October 2001. By the end of the year, the intermediate gates of the staircase had been fitted, as had those on lock 4, and work on a coffer dam around the site of the tidal gate had been started. In January, work started on the construction of an elevated pedestrian walkway through the railway bridge below the staircase, but on 28 January, much of the lower end of the site was flooded by an exceptional high tide, although little damage was caused. Access to the golf club required a new bridge to be installed, and a tube consisting of pre-shaped corrugated steel panels was built on the bank and then lowered by crane into the channel.\n\nThe technique had first been used at Moderna on the Rochdale Canal, although in this case the panels were made in Italy, as no British mills could produce such radiused panels.\n\nThe bridge to carry the Lancaster Canal towpath over the connection basin entrance at the top of the canal arrived on site from the Netherlands on 26 March, but the delivery lorry could not get close enough to the site, and so it was not fitted until 3 April. Further flooding of the lower section occurred on 29 April as a result of heavy rain and a high spring tide, again resulting in significant damage to the works.\n\nJune 2002 saw the coffer dam removed from around the rotating sector gate, and also saw the first vessel on the waterway, when a British Waterways maintenance boat passed from the Lancaster Canal into the connection basin above the staircase locks. A number of boats traversed the navigation in July 2002, in order to assist with the commissioning of the locks and the methods of working. The boats were all owned by members of the Ribble Link Trust, who made their way from Preston Docks to the Lancaster Canal. Problems with the hydraulic swing bridge at the exit from the docks resulted in the boats leaving two hours later than expected, but a very high tide ensured that all the boats managed to pass through the sector gate before water levels dropped. The official opening took place on 20 September 2002, when the Rt. Hon. Margaret Beckett, who was at the time Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, declared the navigation open.\n\nThe Ribble Link was closed during 2006 with British Waterways citing that the appearance of voids meant that the last section was too dangerous to operate for both their own staff and boaters. After dredging and infilling behind lock chambers during the winter of 2006-7, the link was re-opened on 6 April 2007.\n\nThe Millennium Ribble Link runs at the north west of the city of Preston along a canalisation of the Savick Brook, which was tidal along its length to the 3 lock staircase but now limited to its lower reaches. The channel has been straightened and widened to allow navigation by boats with a maximum beam of . One bank of the brook has been left with reed edges, to minimise the disturbance to wildlife, and artificial sand cliffs have been established where those used by nesting sand martins had to be removed as part of the engineering works. In addition to use by boats, a primary aim of the project was to create a feature which could be enjoyed and used by walkers, cyclists and fishermen*(\"See comment above, fishing is not allowed on the Millennium Ribble Link\"). To add interest to such use, an arts sculpture trail has been created running the length of the development with a number of sculptures on view. Adjacent to the Lancaster Canal one which is entitled \"\"Gauging the Ripple\"\", commissioned from the artist Thompson Dagnall. 'Gauging the Ripple' suffered structural integrity loss and had to be removed.\n\nThe link is seasonal for those boats wanting to travel its length, and is normally open between April and mid-October. Even then it is only available on limited days, approx 90 days in total during this period, subject to weather conditions. Passage along it must be booked in advance by contacting British Waterways, and it is operated in alternate directions on successive days. The sea lock at the Ribble end and the triple staircase at the Lancaster Canal end are manned by British Waterways staff, whereas the rest of the locks are unmanned and are operated by boat crews.\n\nThere is no charge to use the Millennium Ribble Link if you have a full boat licence. Pleasure craft on hire are charged £60 per passage (each way). A Millennium Ribble Link Skippers Guide is available from British Waterways and is normally available on their web site. Crossing of the River Ribble is not for the faint hearted and a pilot is available at Tarleton. \"The Savick Brook canal to the River Ribble is only used by the more adventurous boat owners on major expeditions\".\n\nStarting from the Lancaster Canal, the Ribble Link descends about by means of:\n\n\n"}

According to the historian Emmanuel Fureix, the protesters took from the tradition of the charivari the use of noise to express disapproval, and beat saucepans to make noise against government politicians. This way of showing discontent became popular in 1832, taking place mainly at night and sometimes with the participation of thousands of people.3\n\nMore than a century later, in 1961, \"the nights of the pots\" were held in Algeria, in the framework of the Algerian War of Independence. They were thunderous displays of noise in cities of the territory, carried out with homemade pots, whistles, horns and the cry of \"French Algeria\" .4\n\nIn the following decades, this type of protest was limited almost exclusively to South America, with Chile being the first country in the region to register them. Subsequently it has also been seen in Spain —where it is called \"cacerolada\" () or, in Catalan, \"cassolada\")—, and in other countries.\n\nThe word comes from Spanish , which means \"stew pot\". The derivative suffixes \"-azo\" and \"-ada\" denote a hitting (punching or striking) action, and has been extended metaphorically to any sort of shock demonstration. This type of manifestation started in 1971 in Chile, against the shortages of food during the administration of Salvador Allende.\n\nWhen this manner of protest was practiced in Canada, in English it was referred to by most media as \"casseroles\" rather than the Spanish term \"cacerolazo\". In the Philippines, the unrelated term \"noise barrage\" is used for this and a wider set of protest-oriented noisemaking. During the Martial Law period, a noise barrage was held on the eve of the 1978 elections for the Interim Batasang Pambansa, to protest against the authoritarian government of President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nOne of the largest and most recent cacerolazos occurred in Argentina during 2001, consisting largely of protests and demonstrations by middle-class people who had seen their savings trapped in the so-called \"corralito\" (a set of restrictive economic measures that effectively froze all bank accounts, initially as a short-term fix for the massive draining of bank deposits). The \"corralito\" meant that many people who needed a large amount of cash immediately, or who simply lived off the interests from their deposits, suddenly found their savings unavailable. As court appeals were slow and ineffective, people resorted to protest in the streets.\n\nAs the Argentine peso quickly devalued and foreign currency fled the country, the government decreed a forced conversion of dollar-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary exchange rate of 1.4 pesos per dollar. At this point the unavailability of cash for people trapped in the \"corralito\" compounded with the continuous loss of value of their savings, and the unresponsiveness of the appeal authorities (minor courts and the Supreme Court itself) further angered the protesters.\nThe first \"cacerolazos\" were spontaneous and non-partisan. While in Argentina most demonstrations against government measures are customarily organized by labour union activists and low-level political recruiters among the lower classes, and often featuring an assortment of large banners, drums and pyrotechnic devices, \"cacerolazos\" were composed mostly of spontaneously gathered middle-class workers, who otherwise had little to no involvement in grassroots political actions of any kind.\n\nThe \"cacerolazo\" later led to organised street protests, often of a violent nature, directed against the government and banks. Facades were spray-painted, windows broken, entrances blocked by tire fires and some building occupied by force. \n\nIn order to avoid further unrest, especially after the December 2001 riots, the government decided against a more forceful approach against the \"cacerolazos\" unless absolutely necessary and restricted police presence to barricades in critical spots.\n\nIsolated \"cacerolazos\" also featured during the \"apagón\" (\"blackout\") of September 24, 2002, to protest against increases in public service fees requested by the providers. As the financial and macroeconomic conditions became more stable, the government loosened the restrictions on the withdrawal of deposits, and the \"cacerolazos\" ceased.\n\nOn March 25, 2008, a group led by Luis D'Elía, a supporter of the Kirchner administration, and a cacerolazo violently faced each other during the demonstrations pro and against the export tax policy of Cristina Kirchner's government.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, a nationwide cacerolazo took place with a massive following of approximately ten thousand people in the capital alone. The march was organised on the internet and was in protest of the Kirchnerite government, specifically against the introduction of controls on the foreign currency exchange market by Cristina Kirchner's government, rampant crime rates, a sense of disruption and infringement of civil rights due to increasingly interventionist policies by the AFIP tax agency(irs), including a fiscal reform in Buenos Aires province that would more than triple the current land property tax, income tax rates unadjusted according to real inflation, persevering high inflation, a devalued currency, the inability to save money and alleged corruption charges against government and policymakers . These protest where followed by further cacerolazos on May 31 and June 1.\n\nOn June 7, there was a cacerolazo with a concentration of around a thousand people in Plaza de Mayo and in Buenos Aires's avenues intersections of high class neighbourhoods. The following week, June 14, another concentration in Plaza de Mayo was attended by a just a few hundreds.\n\nOn September 13, thousands of Argentines marched in the largest protests since 2008 against the government of President Cristina Fernandez, who, according to an opinion poll by Management & Fit, has lost popularity since her landslide re-election the previous year (this point was contested by the research company Equis, whose CEO Artemio López stated that the popularity indexes remained stable). The event raised a noticeable polemic, as news coverage from most government-aligned newspapers and TV broadcasters was reduced to a minimum, and government officials' claim regarding that the cacerolazo only represented a small and minority portion of the population.\n\nAnother protest was made on November 8, commonly known as 8N amongst the country, principally in the Obelisco and the Plaza de Mayo, and around the world in the major cities of Spain, the US, Canada, Brazil, France, the UK and bordering countries. The latter was also called within Facebook and Twitter, though in contrast to the one on September 13, to which assisted over 50,000 people, 250,000 were present at the 8N. The main complaints were, again the February rail accident victims, the inflation and the reject to the possible \"re-re-election\" of Kirchner, but also insecurity and the Ley de Medios. Again, Todo Noticias dedicated to transmit it completely, while other media supporting the president, such as América TV and C5N, in which a reporter was knocked down were also present.The president of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina, Guillermo Borger, described as \"reprehensible and abominable\" swastikas presence during the protest march held anti-government sectors in the Plaza de Mayo and other parts of the country.\n\"There is nothing that can justify the presence of these symbols\", which recalled \"the aberrant moment in the history of mankind,\" the official told the agency that plays Jewish News (AJN).\n\n\"Cacerolazos\" are known in Brazil as \"panelaços\" (from the Portuguese word for pot \"panela\"). \"Panelaços\" were first popularized in protests against then-President Dilma Rousseff in 2015, when Brazilians would bang pots from the windows and balconies of their apartments during Rousseff's televised speeches.\n\nThe popularity of \"panelaços\" resurfaced in 2020, amid the global pandemic of COVID-19, to protest President Jair Bolsonaro. Motives for the protests have included Bolsonaro's downplaying of the pandemic crisis and his dismissal of Justice minister Sérgio Moro.\n\nIn 2012 in Québec citizens were using cacerolazo after the adoption on 18 May of Bill 78, an act which restricts rights to assemble after peaceful protests were met with police violence in Montreal and Victoriaville. Bill 78, aimed at restoring access to education for those students who disagreed with the general strike and at protecting businesses and citizens from any violence that might occur as a result of a protest, has been criticized by the United Nations, the Quebec Bar Association, Amnesty International, and others. Court challenges against the bill are underway.\n\nA large number \"casseroles\" or \"pots and pans demonstrations\" were held in towns and cities across the province, with the largest ones being primarily concentrated in Montreal's various neighbourhoods. More protests outside the Province of Quebec (over 66 other Canadian locations) were held in solidarity with the student protesters, including cities and towns such as Vancouver, Calgary, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Hamilton, Sudbury, Tatamagouche, and Halifax.\n\nIn 2004, a song named \"Libérez-nous des libéraux\" (Liberate Us From Liberals) was written, which prophesied \"Need to rush into the street / like a spring flood / shattering our discontent / a debacle of pans / enough talking, make noise / a charivari to topple the party / as in Argentine, in Bolivia\". On June 15, 2012, when the same band played a gig at Francofolies, they asked everybody to bring their pans and spoons.\n\nCacerolazos began in Chile in 1971 in protest at food shortages during the Salvador Allende administration, with the empty pots symbolising the difficulties of households in obtaining enough food to feed families. They were initially led and driven by women, representing household economic stresses as distinct from the industrial protests representing business relating financial stresses. By 1973 they had become commonplace as protests against the administration intensified amid increasing shortages. After Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973 cacerolazos disappeared for a time until the economic crisis of 1982-83 set in. Thereafter cacerolazos continued up until the Pinochet regime lost a plebiscite in 1988 that put him out of office two years later.\n\n\"Cacerolazos\" were organized in 2011 for two different reasons. On May 15 there was pot-banging in several cities in protest of the HidroAysén dam project. Then in August there were two \"cacerolazos\" across the country in support of student protests, the first in August 4 and a second one in August 8.\n\nOn November 18 there was another \"cacerolazo\" because of the murder of a Mapuche farmer, Camilo Catrillanca, under the fault of Chile's anti-terrorist police unit \"Comando Jungla\" (Jungle Command) in the community of Temucuicui, in Chile's Araucania Region on November 14. He was working with his tractor near his home when he was shot twice in the back of his head; 5 other people resulted injured.\n\nOn October 18, 2019 the \"cacerolazo\" started after the president Sebastián Piñera announced the increase on the price of the metro ticket, following from the 'EvasionMasiva' protest movement. Though, the protests had already been present in various cities (see 2019 Chilean protests) this events lead the president to declare the emergency state in the city of Santiago, which lead to a much stronger response from the population.\n\nA cacerolazo in Quito, Ecuador occurred on October 12 during the 2019 Ecuadorian protests in spite of (or because of) a government-mandated curfew. Both sides claimed that the cacerolazo had been organized by them to support their cause. The following day, indigenous peoples met with the Moreno government for a dialog and the protests were resolved.\n\nThe protests following the financial crisis that started in 2008 are sometimes called The Kitchenware Revolution, because people took to the streets banging on pots and pans and other household utensils.\n\nIndia \n\nOn March 22nd 2020 at 5 PM IST for 5 minutes\n\nIndians across the country used sauce pans and other kitchen utensils to make noise to show their appreciation and support to all the service men and women on the front line for the fight against Corona Virus. \n\nMore than a billion people in India volunteeringly stayed indoors for 14-hours to try to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told citizens that it would be a test in order to assess the county's ability to fight the virus and to come out on their balconies at 5 pm and make noise with bells or kitchen utilities to show their support for all service men.\n\nIn 2019, nationwide protests erupted in Lebanon on October 17 following years of political corruption and economic instability. Protesters in Saida, Tripoli, and Beirut, as well as many other cities and regions in the country, took to banging on pots and kitchen utensils from their balconies. This technique was also integrated in street protests. Online calls were circulated to repeat this form of demonstration every day at 8:00 P.M.\n\nDuring the summer of 2019 Puerto Rico endured a political and constitutional crisis caused by indictments on corruption charges of cabinet officials, and revelations of a Telegram chat group led by the sitting governor, Ricardo Rosselló. This chat group included government officials and lobbyists, and revealed that the governor and other participants made homophobic, misogynistic, and other prejudicial comments which also mocked the dead and other victims of Hurricane Maria, as well as threatened and defamed political opponents, the press, and others who they considered not to be allied with their government. The country erupted in protests, and for 15 straight days all sectors of Puerto Rican society took to the streets in peaceful protests. Cacerolazos were a key expression of public rage and took place in front of the executive mansion, in public plazas across the islands, from the balconies of condominiums, the patios of homes, and other public settings. The governor eventually resigned as a result of these protests, which led to a constitutional crisis of succession. In less than a week Puerto Rico had three different occupants in the governor's office, and to date the crisis has not yet been fully resolved.\n\nIn 2006, during the Oaxaca protests that saw thousands occupy their city following the police repression of teachers' strike, 5000 women marchers banged pots and pans with spoons and meat tenderizers. Their march took them through the city squares and to outside the state-run television station channel 9. The women demanded a one-hour slot to report on the people's story of what was happening in Oaxaca; a story that was censored and skewed by government propaganda against the protesters. When the station refused the women, still carrying their pots and pans, entered the building and took over the station. They carried out live broadcasts of the people's struggles.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Hirak Rif or Rif Movement activists in the Rif region used Cacerolazo to protest against Morocco's politics in the Rif region.\n\n\"Pandorga\", \"mojingas\", \"rondas de mozos\", \"matracas\" or simply \"cencerradas\" were the terms to refer in Spain to mocking rituals in which folks took part in using kitchenware and/or similar utensils. It is however difficult to trace a historical continuity between \"cencerradas\" and modern day \"caceroladas\".\n\nA majority of Spaniards were against the Iraq War and provoked during 2003 cacerolazo-fashioned protests against the government decision to support it. People protested from their homes turning lights on and off, making noise with whistles and klaxons and hitting stew pots. In Huesca lamp posts of 16 streets were turned off in protest during 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the Catalan general strike in October 2017, Catalans protested the response of King Felipe VI with cacerolazo.\n\nA widespread \"cacerolada\" from the balconies of cities across Spain was organised on 18 March 2020 counterprogramming the TV discourse of Felipe VI on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, intending to force king emeritus Juan Carlos to donate to public healthcare the €100M he had allegedly obtained through kickbacks from Saudi Arabia.\n\nA number of \"Caceroladas\" have been called throughout the country in the months of April and May of 2020 to protest against the Government management of the Coronavirus Crisis. \n\nDuring the 2013 protests in Turkey when late at night after May 31 people in central Istanbul were forced to go to their homes due to the high amounts of tear gas, they continued protesting from their homes by banging pots and pans. About half past one the entire city started to reverberate. This also functioned to create awareness of the situation since the self-censorship of media prevented people from being informed about the scale of the protests. After the first day, this form of protests continued, starting every evening at 9pm, lasting a few minutes.\n\nAfter the 2013 presidential election on 15 April millions of Capriles supporters banged their pots and pans in the streets and from their windows after Capriles refused to accept the results, asked for a recount, and told the whole country to protest during a power cut of three hours in some places nationwide. The next day, Capriles supporters continued the cacerolazo, asking for a recount. Similar concentrations were observed all over the world, particularly in South and Central Florida, where a lot of Venezuelan citizens reside, most of them Capriles sympathizers. It was no less than Capriles himself who called for a \"cacerolazo\" to denounce the election results, after the National Electoral Council declared Nicolás Maduro of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela the official winner in the snap presidential elections held the previous day.\n\nSeveral cacerolazos took place during the 2014 Venezuelan protests. On August, the MUD reactivated protests by calling on supporters to hold a nationwide cacerolazo at 8:00 pm local time against the new proposed fingerprint rationing system. The cacerolazo took placer in several states. \n\nAfter marches on a national level to Caracas to demand a recall referendum on 2016, opposition leader Chúo Torrealba called for a cacerolazo. While Maduro was inaugurating houses of the \"Gran Misión Barrio Nuevo, Barrio Tricolor\", people from Villa Rosa, Nueva Esparta state, received him with a cacerolazo. At least 30 persons were detained by the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) after the cacerolazo in Villa Rosa.\n\nDuring the 2017 Venezuelan protests, many cacerolazos also took place. On 15 June cacerolazos were held in Caracas, where the banging pots were heard throughout the capital city. After the results of the 2018 presidential election were read, where Nicolás Maduro was declared reelected, many Venezuelans throughout Caracas started a cacerolazo protest against Maduro, with some beginning to barricade streets.\n\nDuring the Venezuelan presidential crisis, on 21 January 2019, a group of National Guardsmen rose up in Cotiza, in Caracas. Neighbors nearby started a \"cacerolazo\" and a demonstration in support of the officers. Government forces repressed the protestors tear gas and the uprising was quelled quickly. People in Caracas also held cacerolazos during the 2019 blackouts to protest against the outages.\n\n\n"}

The building, designed by Otto Wagner, is considered one of the most important Art Nouveau churches in the world.\n\nThe church, situated above sea level, dominates and forms part of the Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital; previous official title was \"Niederösterreichische Landes-Heil- und Pflegeanstalt für Nerven- und Geisteskranke 'Am Steinhof' \" (Lower Austrian State Healing and Care Institution for the Neurologically and Mentally Sick, 'Am Steinhof'). It is located on a hillside (the Baumgartnerhöhe) below the Galitzinberg in the 14th Vienna district, Penzing. It has a separate status as part of the surrounding hospital and does not form part of the Archdiocese of Vienna.\n\nThe church dedicated to Saint Leopold was built between 1903 and 1907 by the 63-year-old architect Otto Wagner, with mosaics and stained glass by Koloman Moser, and sculptural angels by Othmar Schimkowitz (1864–1947). The great majority of the other smaller details are the work of Otto Wagner himself. The statues on the two external towers represent Saint Leopold and Saint Severin (l. & r. respectively: they are the two patron saints of Lower Austria) and are the work of the Viennese sculptor Richard Luksch (1872–1936).\n\nUnusually the church lies on a North-South axis, at the centre-top of the hospital complex. Otto Wagner incorporated numerous features specifically related to its function within an asylum: e.g. there are very few sharp edges, and most corners are rounded; almost no crosses are visible; the priest's area is potentially entirely separate from the patients'; access to the pulpit is only from the vestry; emergency exits are built into the side walls in case a patient needed to be speedily removed; continuously flowing water replaced holy water stoups at the entrance; there were separate entrances for male and female patients, since gender segregation was mandatory in mental institutions at the time; confessionals were more open than is customary. There were toilet facilities easily accessible within the church in case of patient need. Originally the pews were of different widths to accommodate different categories of patient: calm / restless / disturbed (the latter needing more space). The floor is raked as in a theatre though not as steeply; the fall from entrance to altar is approx. : standing at the back the view to the altar is thus less obstructed.\n\nThe central ceiling below the unseen dome bears images relating to the four evangelists: the man for Matthew, the lion for Mark, the calf for Luke, the eagle for John. The magnificent windows at the sides of the Kirche am Steinhof portray seven saints (named underneath each frame) fulfilling Christ's commands both temporal (feed the hungry, clothe the naked, etc.) and spiritual; with above them a pair of flying angels and a quotation from the Beatitudes. The elaborate and brightly coloured mosaic behind the ornate altar represents the reception of the departed soul into heaven, via an ornate trompe-l'oeil staircase which has been compared unfairly to a Hollywood-style movie award ceremony. Among the numerous saints attending the ceremony is Saint Dymphna the patron saint of those afflicted by epilepsy or mental illness. Also visible is St. Clement Hofbauer or Clemens Maria Hofbauer (1751–1820), the patron saint of Vienna. The dome of the church is not visible from inside the building; even so, the nave has an echo of six seconds. The church seats 800 people when full.\n\nDue to lack of funds, several of Otto Wagner's original designs were never realized, including the Procession of the Cross, a private chapel beneath the church for Protestant services, and a Jewish synagogue.\n\nThe organ placed in the rear gallery is the work of the important turn-of-the-century organ builder Franz Josef Swoboda, among whose other instruments nearby are the organ at the Peterskirche in the centre of Vienna, and the organ of the Donaufeld church in the suburb of Floridsdorf on the other side of the Danube.\n\nThe Church of St. Leopold, better known as the Kirche am Steinhof, was built during the construction of the Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital (now the ), from 1904 to 1907. When drafting his plans for the building, the commissioned architect, Otto Wagner, respected the church's role as the institutional chapel for mentally ill patients and consulted with doctors and nurses concerning the specific requirements of such a building. On October 8, 1907, the church was opened by Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The Archduke and Wagner were at odds on a variety of issues, not least on the overall design of the church. The former had disapproved of Wagner's art nouveau style from the very beginning; so much so, in fact, that he refused to acknowledge Wagner during the opening ceremony or to commission any other work from the architect. But opinions regarding Wagner's unusual design were varied. In an article published in the New Free Press on October 6, 1907, the author rhetorically asked: \"And is it not a beautiful irony of fate, that the first sensible secessionist building in Vienna has been built for the insane?\"\n\nThe most recent, and most extensive, restoration project began in June 2000. All told, 22 construction companies and 15 consultants worked on the restoration. Their first undertaking was to completely re-gild the exterior dome using 2 kg of .01mm-thin sheets of gold leaf. The base of the dome was renewed with copper sheets that, prior to their placement, were artificially patinated.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, the entirety of the church's 1,800m² façade was replaced with 3000 plates of Carrara marble, each tile having been examined by ultrasound to ensure quality. The angelic and holy figures were removed and transported to a workshop where they were restored. Construction began on the interior of the church in 2005. Among other projects, each of the mosaic windowpanes were glazed and remounted in a specially designed support structure. The windows, which have been valued at 5 million Euro, are now better protected from the elements and vandalism. The mosaics within the church, main altar, pulpit, chandeliers, sconces, and wall decorations were restored and newly gilded. Trained wood restorers polished and improved the pews and confessionals. The plasterboard ceiling was also rebuilt. About half of the original 2,200 plaster tiles were salvageable, the rest were replaced.\n\nWhile the interior renovations were ongoing, the foundation of the church, the drainage system, and the exterior base were completely renewed. After the renovations were complete, a wheelchair-accessible entrance was added on the north side of the church.\n\nAfter the 6-year long renovation project, the church was finally reopened on October 1, 2006.\n\nPrior to its reopening, Steinhof church was selected as a main motif of one of the most famous euro collectors coins: the Austrian 100 euro Steinhof Church commemorative coin, minted on November 9, 2005. The obverse gives an angled perspective view of the left-side and main door of the building.\n\n"}

He appeared as a forward for Oxford University as they finished runners-up in the 1877 FA Cup Final against Wanderers.\n\nHe continued to play as an amateur for Old Harrovians after he left, even winning a Corinthian's Cap whilst there; for England, against Scotland on 5 April 1879 at the Kennington Oval, when England won 5–4.\n\nIn addition to his vegetarian activism, Hills was Managing Director of the Thames Iron Works, a large shipbuilding business in London which had existed since 1846. He chose to live for five years among his workers in a small house in the East India Dock Road in Canning Town and organised recreational centres for them.\n\nHowever, he caused some bitterness when there was a strike over poor pay and working conditions by employing 'black' labour. Considering his philanthropy, it must have been a situation that troubled him greatly.\n\nIn the summer of 1895 Hills, along with Dave Taylor, helped found Thames Ironworks F.C., who later became West Ham United. He believed that his own local community should have its own football team and financially supported the football club until April 1900, when after increasing disagreements with West Ham's board members over the pursuit of 'professionalism', he broke formal ties with the club and the Thames Ironworks.\n\nHills proposed a West Ham as a limited company and became the major shareholder, and encouraged business associates, family and his workman to invest, promising to buy one share for every one sold to the public. He rented the Memorial Grounds to the club at very favourable terms. Hills told the new directors he would not interfere in the running of the club and was true to his word and despite being by far the largest single shareholder never attended an AGM, ask to address a meeting or present any demands or suggestions.\n\nThe failing fortunes of the ironworks and his involvement in developing a new car engine pushed the club into the background and he became a virtual invalid suffering from arthritis. He died at Hammerfield, Penshurst, Kent, in 1927 aged 69, and was buried at St Luke's Church in Penshurt. His shareholding in West Ham of 1100 out of 4000 (1142 shares remained unsold until 1961) passed to his family and the same arrangements remained.\n\nIn 2014 as part of their preparation for their move to the Olympic Stadium, West Ham announced one of the corporate entertainment areas would be a private dining club, the Arnold Hills suite.\n\nHills was the first President of the London Vegetarian Society (1888) serving alongside the young Mahatma Gandhi on the Executive Committee. He was also the first President of the Vegetarian Cycling and Athletic Club and also served as President of a London Vegetarian Rambling Club. He founded \"The Vegetarian\", an independent magazine, as well as the Vegetarian Federal Union (1889), of which he was also President. He also had close ties with the Temperance League. He founded the Oriolet Fruitarian Hospital at Loughton, under the medical direction of Josiah Oldfield.\n\nHills authored \"Vital Food\" (1892) which argued for a plant-based raw food diet.\n\nCharles W. Forward's 1898 book on vegetarian history, \"Fifty Years of Food Reform\" was dedicated to Hills.\n\n\n"}

It was produced for the BBC by the independent Red Production Company, and created by Paul Abbott.\n\nIt was effectively an anthology programme, following the lives of a group of workers at a Manchester textile factory, with each episode focusing on the home life of a different character. Well-known actors who appeared in the series included Christopher Eccleston, Sophie Okonedo, Philip Glenister, John Simm, Lesley Sharp, Siobhan Finneran, Emma Cunniffe, Diane Parish, David Morrissey, Ricky Tomlinson, Julian Rhind-Tutt, William Ash, Ben Crompton, Jack Deam, Jack P. Shepherd, Tina O'Brien, Jason Merrells, Pam Ferris, Wil Johnson, Ashley Jensen, Susan Cookson, Mark Benton, Sarah Lancashire, Crissy Rock, Marshall Lancaster, Marc Warren, Claire Sweeney and Maxine Peake.\n\nThe series was highly acclaimed by the critics, winning the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2001. However, over the course of the following two years Abbott's work on the series decreased as he moved on to other projects. Nonetheless, every series was nominated for a BAFTA and other writers including Danny Brocklehurst, John Fay and Jan McVerry wrote successful stand-alone episodes. The programme finally ended, after a series with no Abbott scripts at all, in 2003. The BBC said the programme was axed following declining ratings, but creator Abbott said the programme's demise was down to \"a lack of writers able to come up with stories good enough to carry the stand alone episodes.\"\n\nTwenty-seven episodes were produced across the four series, and in 2004 the first series was released on DVD. In 2015, the first series was released on DVD in Australia and was made available for purchase via the BBC Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2019798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019798", "title": "Normalcy bias", "text": "Normalcy bias\n\nNormalcy bias, or normality bias, is a cognitive bias which leads people to disbelieve or minimize threat warnings. Consequently, individuals underestimate the likelihood of a disaster, when it might affect them, and its potential adverse effects. The normalcy bias causes many people to not adequately prepare for natural disasters, pandemics, and calamities caused by human error. About 70% of people reportedly display normalcy bias during a disaster.\n\nThe normalcy bias can manifest in response to warnings about disasters and actual catastrophes. Such disasters include pandemics, motor vehicle accidents, natural disasters like a tsunami, and war.\n\nNormalcy bias has also been called \"analysis paralysis\", \"the ostrich effect\", and by first responders, \"the negative panic\". The opposite of normalcy bias is overreaction, or worst-case scenario bias, in which small deviations from normality are dealt with as signals of an impending catastrophe.\n\nAmanda Ripley, author of \"The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes – and Why\", identifies common response patterns of people in disasters and explains that there are three phases of response: Denial, Deliberation, and the Decisive Moment. With regard to the first phase, described as Denial, Ripley found that people were likely to deny that a disaster was happening. It takes time for the brain to process information and recognize that a disaster is a threat. In the Deliberation phase, people have to decide what to do. If the person does not have a plan in place, this creates a serious problem because the effects of life-threatening stress on the body (e.g. tunnel vision, audio exclusion, time dilations, out-of-body experiences, or reduced motor skills) limit an individual's ability to perceive information and make plans. Ripley asserts that in the third and final phase, described as the Decisive Moment, a person must act quickly and decisively. Failure to do so can result in injury or death. She explains that the faster someone can get through the Denial and Deliberation phase, the quicker they will reach the Decisive Moment and begin to take action.\n\n\"Normalcy bias flows into the brain no matter the scale of the problem,\" journalist David McRaney has written. \"It will appear whether you have days and plenty of warning or are blindsided with only seconds between life and death.\" It can manifest itself in phenomena such as car crashes. Car crashes occur very frequently, but the average individual experiences them only rarely, if ever. It also manifests itself in connection with events in world history. According to a 2001 study by sociologist Thomas Drabek, when people are asked to leave in anticipation of a disaster, most check with four or more sources of information before deciding what to do. The process of checking in, known as milling, is common in disasters.\n\nAs for events in world history, the normalcy bias explains why, when the volcano Vesuvius erupted, the residents of Pompeii watched for hours without evacuating. It explains why thousands of people refused to leave New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina approached and why at least 70% of 9/11 survivors spoke with others before leaving. Officials at the White Star Line made insufficient preparations to evacuate passengers on the \"Titanic\" and people refused evacuation orders because they underestimated the odds of a worst-case scenario and minimized its potential impact. Similarly, experts connected with the Fukushima nuclear power plant were strongly convinced that a multiple reactor meltdown could never occur.\n\nA website for police officers has noted that members of that profession have \"all seen videos of officers who were injured or killed while dealing with an ambiguous situation, like the old one of a father with his young daughter on a traffic stop\". In the video referred to, \"the officer misses multiple threat cues...because the assailant talks lovingly about his daughter and jokes about how packed his minivan is. The officer only seems to react to the positive interactions, while seeming to ignore the negative signals. It's almost as if the officer is thinking, 'Well I've never been brutally assaulted before so it certainly won't happen now.' No one is surprised at the end of the video when the officer is violently attacked, unable to put up an effective defense.\" This professional failure, notes the website, is a consequence of normalcy bias.\n\nNormalcy bias, David McRaney has written, \"is often factored into fatality predictions in everything from ship sinkings to stadium evacuations.\" Disaster movies, he adds, \"get it all wrong. When you and others are warned of danger, you don’t evacuate immediately while screaming and flailing your arms.\" McRaney notes that in the book \"Big Weather\", tornado chaser Mark Svenvold discusses \"how contagious normalcy bias can be. He recalled how people often tried to convince him to chill out while fleeing from impending doom. Even when tornado warnings were issued, people assumed it was someone else's problem. Stake-holding peers, he said, would try to shame him into denial so they could remain calm. They didn't want him deflating their attempts at feeling normal\".\n\nPeople who promote conspiracy theories or apocalyptic future scenarios have cited the normalcy bias as a prime reason why others scoff at their pronouncements. For example, survivalists who fear that the U.S. will soon descend into totalitarianism cite normalcy bias as the reason why most Americans do not share their worries. Similarly, fundamentalist Christians use the normalcy bias to explain why others scoff at their beliefs about the \"End Time\". One fundamentalist website writes: \"May we not get blinded by the 'normalcy bias' but rather live with the knowledge that the Lord’s coming is near.\"\n\nThe normalcy bias may be caused in part by the way the brain processes new data. Research suggests that even when the brain is calm, it takes 8–10 seconds to process new information. Stress slows the process, and when the brain cannot find an acceptable response to a situation, it fixates on a single and sometimes default solution that may or may not be correct. An evolutionary reason for this response could be that paralysis gives an animal a better chance of surviving an attack and predators are less likely to see prey that is not moving.\n\nAbout 70% of people reportedly display normalcy bias in disasters. Normalcy bias has been described as \"one of the most dangerous biases we have\". The lack of preparation for disasters often leads to inadequate shelter, supplies, and evacuation plans. Even when all these things are in place, individuals with a normalcy bias often refuse to leave their homes.\n\nNormalcy bias can cause people to drastically underestimate the effects of the disaster. Therefore, people think that they will be safe even though information from the radio, television, or neighbors gives them reasons to believe there is a risk. The normalcy bias creates a cognitive dissonance that people then must work to eliminate. Some manage to eliminate it by refusing to believe new warnings coming in and refusing to evacuate (maintaining the normalcy bias), while others eliminate the dissonance by escaping the danger. The possibility that some people may refuse to evacuate causes significant problems in disaster planning.\n\nThe negative effects of normalcy bias can be combated through the four stages of disaster response:\n\nThe opposite of normalcy bias is overreaction bias. Noting the effect regression to the mean, most deviations from normalcy do not lead to catastrophe, despite regular predictions of doomsday. Both underreaction (normalcy bias) and overreaction (worst-case thinking) are cognitive flaws and may extend to patterns of cognitive distortions.\n"}

As a high school student, Milić participated at painting exhibitions in the town.\n\nBecause of poverty, his parents decided that he should attend the Military Academy in Belgrade. Milić was accepted, but at the last moment, managed to convince his parents that architecture would be better for him and more promising for the future.

They are based at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.\n\nThe franchise area encompasses the western half of the Free State province, the same as that of provincial Currie Cup side the . Between 2006 and 2015, the from the eastern half of the Free State province and from the Northern Cape province were Cheetahs franchise partners, but this ended prior to the 2016 Super Rugby season.\n\nThe Cheetahs was one of the two new franchises that entered the expanded Super 14 competition in 2006, the other being Australia's Western Force. The Central Union was awarded the fifth South African franchise over the SEC franchise in April 2005. In its first season the Cheetahs did surprisingly well, finishing tenth in the final standings, out of 14 sides. Prior to being accepted into the 2006 Super 14 season, the Cheetahs were represented as a part of the Cats. In addition, before the South African Rugby Union entered regionalised franchises into the competition, the Free State Cheetahs side competed in the 1997 Super 12 season.\n\nThe primary strip for the Toyota Cheetahs is an orange jersey with a white collar and white trim.

The Free State Cheetahs, one of the sides that make up the current Central Cheetahs, competed in one Super 12 season in 1997. The Free State played 11 matches, winning 5 and losing 6. They placed 7th on the end of season standings.\n\nProposals by the Central Union franchise and the SEC (Southern and Eastern Cape) franchise were studied for the allocation of a fifth Super Rugby team licence. The Central Union emphasized points to the SARU such as that the region is second only to the Western Province in terms of producing players for the national side. The Central Union noted that they have a strong and stable fanbase that would be able to meet financial and administrative responsibilities and demands of a Super 14 rugby side.\n\nIn mid April 2005, the South African Rugby Union announced that the Central Unions franchise would be its fifth team for the expanded Super 14 competition that would begin in 2006. They were awarded the franchise ahead of the Southern and Eastern Cape (see Southern Spears). In the pre-season of their entrance to the new look Super 14 competition, the Cheetahs played both of the other new franchises, new Australian team; the Western Force and 2007 fellow South African team, the Southern Spears. The Cheetahs proved to be the strongest out of the new sides, demolishing the Spears 48 to nil and soundly defeating the Force in Perth. \nThe Cheetahs played their first game on 10 February, proving they are fighting fit, but were not good enough on the day for the South African Bulls, losing their first official match in Bloemfontein 18 points to 30. The Cheetahs won their first Super 14 game in week two, defeating the Sharks in a thrilling match seeing the Cheetahs win by a single point, 27 to 26. Entering round four of the 2006 season, the Cheetahs were facing the table leaders, the Hurricanes. In a surprise result, the Cheetahs beat the table leaders, thus winning their first home game and proving they deserve to be in the Super 14.\n\nThe Cheetahs finally broke their drought in overseas matches with an upset over the New South Wales Waratahs on 19 March 2011.\n\nFollowing SANZAAR's decision to reduce the number of teams for 2018, the South African Rugby Union announced that the Cheetahs would be one of the teams cut from the 2018 competition.

He is considered to be one of the most important Serbian painters of the 20th century. Šumanović's opus includes around 800 paintings as well as 400 drawings and sketches. He was executed during the Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nSava Šumanović was born in Vinkovci, Austria-Hungary (now in Croatia) in 1896 where his father was working as an engineer. Šumanovićs were rich and influential family which was recorded in Šid as of the 18th century. When Šumanović was four years old his family moved to Šid (modern-day Serbia). He graduated High School in Zemun, where he was first introduced to the art of painting. He later enrolled in the College of Crafts and Arts in Zagreband soon after he lived in Paris for several years, since 1920. His professor in Paris was André Lhote. Šumanović befriended Amedeo Modigliani, Max Jacob and various Paris-based Serbian artists and writers such as Rastko Petrović. In 1924 Šumanović wrote two notable essays, \"Slikar o slikarstvu\" i \"Zašto volim Pusenovo slikarstvo\".\n\nLiving for a couple of years in Croatia, Šumanović returned to Paris in late 1925, and stayed again for several years, accepting certain influences of the Matisse painting style. Šumanović returned to Šid in 1928 and after another year spent in Paris, eventually settled there in 1930. His major exhibition was at the Belgrade New University in 1939, where he exposed roughly 410 paintings mostly from the Šid period. It was his first major success after many years. He lived quietly in Šid until the outbreak of World War II in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, when the Nazi puppet state Independent State of Croatia led by the Croatian fascist Ustaše, occupied Syrmia and began a genocide campaign against Jews, Serbs and Romani people.\n\nUstaše police arrested Šumanović together with 150 Serbian citizens and took them to a concentration camp in Sremska Mitrovica. Šumanović was executed there on 30 August 1942, together with many other Serbs and buried in a common grave in a Serbian Orthodox graveyard.\n\nHis early artistic style was characterized by various influences, mainly Cubism, but Fauvism and Expressionism as well. In his later works, Sava Šumanović managed to develop his own, rather original artistic expression, which he simply called \"the way I know and can.\" Due to innovations and unique style, Šumanović can be described as one of the most prominent Serbian painters of the twentieth century as well as a major painter from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n\nA museum dedicated to his life and work is located in Šid. His works are also on display in the museums of Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Zrenjanin and Split.\n\nA gallery devoted to Šumanović's work was established in 1952 based on a gift from Persida Šumanović, the painter's mother. The legacy of 417 works of art, out of which 356 are oil paintings is located in the Šumanović family home (also used as a court). In 1989 the building was renovated and the original exhibition area was expanded from . This enabled a large number of paintings to be exhibited simultaneously. The main activity of the gallery is the preservation and presentation of paintings obtained as gifts. In addition to this, a rich collection of documentary materials has been amassed, as well as an extraordinarily rich Hermoteca (newspaper and periodical library), containing the catalogues from all the exhibitions held until now.\n\nAlso part of the gallery is the Memorial House of Sava Šumanović, as well as the archaeological collection “Gradina on the Bosut”, and an antique sarcophagus. The artistic circle “Sava Šumanović,” consisting of local amateur painters, also operates within the gallery. Ten years after the gallery had been established, the memorial in honour of Sava Šumanović was initiated, an event which takes place every three years.\n\nThe July 2019 exhibition of his works organised by the Gallery of Matica Srpska in Cultural Center of Serbia in Paris caused wider media coverage and attention.\n\nHe is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs list.\n\n\n\"Sava Sumanovic: surrendering to the passion\" by Ljubica Miljković, 2007\n"}
{"id": "2019814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019814", "title": "Branko Radičević", "text": "Branko Radičević\n\nAleksije \"Branko\" Radičević (, ; 28 March 1824 – 1 July 1853) was an influential Serbian poet and the founder of modern Serbian lyric poetry.\n\nBranko Radičević was born in Slavonski Brod on 15 March 1824. Aleksije was his baptismal name before he changed it to Branko, a more common Serbian name. He finished high school in Sremski Karlovci, the setting of his best poems. He studied in Vienna. In 1847 Radičević's first book of poetry appeared, announcing a new era in Serbian poetry. He went to Serbia but soon returned to Vienna to study medicine, where he was surrounded by Serb intellectuals, either living in the city or passing through, including his lifelong friend Bogoboj Atanacković, Vuk Karadžić, Đuro Daničić, Milica Stojadinović-Srpkinja, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, and others. Radičević's second collection of poetry was a bit weaker than the first. He wrote after this, but never recovered his early raptures, except among the very latest of all his poems, the enchanting welcome to death, in this twenty-ninth year, entitled \"Kad mlidijah umreti\" (As I Thought of Dying).\n\nRadičević gave expression to simple emotion such as joy on a sunny morning or in a fishing boat, pleasure derived from flowers, the exuberance of school youth, patriotic fervor, and love's joys and sorrows. His youthful zeal is also expressed in unabashed eroticism and in the exultation of wine, women and song, according to critic Jovan Skerlić, perhaps the best authority on Branko Radičević. More importantly, he was the first to write poetry in the simple language of the common folk. He attempted to recreate rhythm of the folk song, thus supporting the belief of Vuk Karadžić that even poetry can be written in the language of peasants and shepherds.\" Radičević proved to be very important to Vuk Karadžić's victory because he gathered his generation of young writers and poets around the cause of language reform. His work was described as \"the first dew of Serbian poetry in the folk language of Vuk Karadžić.\"\n\nSkerlić writes in his \"History of New Serbian Literature\" that Branko Radičević had a significant influence on Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, Bogoboj Atanacković, Kosta Ruvarac, Jovan Grčić Milenko, and other Serbian poets and writers of the period.\n\nHe died of tuberculosis in Vienna 1853 and in 1883 his remains were buried in Stražilovo. Radičević's early death was a great loss to Serbian letters; for he was by far the most promising of the younger lyric poets of his time.\n\n\"Đački rastanak\" (The Parting of Schoolfriends) is the best and most popular of his works. Nothing is lovelier in this remarkable poem than those passages in which he pictures the life of college students. For a time he gives himself up to the fleeting impressions of the moment. He greets the gently rolling hills and coolness of the forest and delights in the view of the Danube valley below with its widening rivers and vistas. In \"Put\" (A Journey), a magnanimous allegory, Branko has shown unusual skill in satirical nomenclature by stigmatizing Vuk Stefanović Karadžić's adversaries who disapproved the reforms of language and orthography. His lyrics display extreme tenderness, beauty, originality and delicacy of fancy. Some of his shorter pieces are adapted to national melodies and are sung by young people all over the country. His poetry may be small in bulk and slight in body, but it endures, and will endure, in Serbian literature, because it is the embodiment of the spirit of immortal youth. It has been said that Branko is the poet of spring, and those who have not read him before the meridian of their lives may abandon all hope of penetrating him when the snows of time are on their heads.\n\nRadičević left some unfinished work. He left at least one text meriting close attention in any inquiry into Slavic Romantic irony, the ambitious unfinished poem of 1477 lines, composed in 1849, and featuring two titles: \"Ludi Branko\" (Branko the Fool) and \"Bezimena\" (Unnamed). Seventy-four years later, literary critics Pavle Popović and his brother Bogdan Popović found that in this poetic fragment \"there is no poetry whatsoever\" and that it \"merits no compliment of any kind.\" Comparisons with European phenomena lead Serbian intellectuals and publicists such as Tihomir Ostojić, Ilija M. Petrović, Božidar Kovačević and Vladeta Vuković to reduce it to an imitation or at best thorough influence of Byron. Only after the centenary of Radičević's death, began the re-evaluation of \"Bezimena\" in essays by Salko Nezečić, Ljubiša Rajković and others. Milan Dedinac and Miodrag Popović, in his 1969 treatise, which is the first true scholarly study of the fragment since Ostojić's monograph of 1918, both move \"Bezimena\" away from Byron and Romanticism and toward Pushkin's \"Eugene Onegin\" and Vissarion Belinsky's essay of 1843 about Pushkin and Realism.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1852, at the very climax of the personal activity of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić, several poets were born, who were destined to enrich the Serbian language with its first group of lyrical blossoms. Of these eldest, Peter II Petrovich Njegoš and Branko Radičević, were men of extraordinary gifts, and destined to fascinate the attention of posterity, not only by the brilliance of their work, but by the suffering and brevity of their lives.

{"id": "2019824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019824", "title": "Tokugawa clan", "text": "Tokugawa clan\n\nThe was a powerful \"daimyō\" family of Japan. They nominally descended from Emperor Seiwa (850–880) and were a branch of the Minamoto clan (Seiwa Genji) by the Nitta clan. The early history of this clan remains a mystery. Members of the clan ruled Japan as \"shōguns\" from 1603 to 1867.\n\nMinamoto no Yoshishige (1135–1202), grandson of Minamoto no Yoshiie (1041–1108), was the first to take the name of Nitta. He sided with his cousin Minamoto no Yoritomo against the Taira clan (1180) and accompanied him to Kamakura. Nitta Yoshisue, 4th son of Yoshishige, settled at Tokugawa (Kozuke province) and took the name of that place. Their provincial history book did not mention Minamoto clan or Nitta clan.\n\nThe nominal originator of the Matsudaira clan was reportedly , who was originally a poor Buddhist monk. He reportedly descended from Nitta Yoshisue in the 8th generation and witnessed the ruin of the Nitta in their war against the Ashikaga. He settled at Matsudaira (Mikawa province) and was adopted by his wife's family. Their provincial history book claimed that this original clan was Ariwara clan. Because this place is said to have been reclaimed by Nobumori Ariwara, one theory holds that Matsudaira clan was related to Ariwara no Narihira. Matsudaira Nobumitsu (15th century), son of Chikauji, was in charge of Okazaki Castle, and strengthened the authority of his family in the Mikawa province. Nobumitsu's great-great-grandson Matsudaira Kiyoyasu made his clan strong, but was assassinated. In 1567, Tokugawa Ieyasu - then known as Matsudaira Motonobu (1542–1616) - grandson of Kiyoyasu, was recognized by Emperor Ōgimachi as a descendant of Seiwa Genji; he also started the family name Tokugawa. The clan rose to power at the end of the Sengoku period, and to the end of the Edo period they ruled Japan as \"shōguns\". There were fifteen Tokugawa \"shōguns\". Their dominance was so strong that some history books use the term \"Tokugawa era\" instead of \"Edo period\". Their principal family shrine is the Tōshō-gū in Nikkō, and principal temple is at Kan'ei-ji in Tokyo. Heirlooms of the clan are partly administered by the Tokugawa Memorial Foundation.\n\nAfter the death of Ieyasu, in 1636, the heads of the \"gosanke\" (the three branches with fiefs in Owari, Kishū, and Mito) also bore the Tokugawa surname, so did the three additional branches, known as the \"gosankyō\": the Tayasu (1731), Hitotsubashi (1735), and Shimizu (1758) family, after the ascension of Tokugawa Yoshimune. Once a shōgun died without a living heir, both the heads of \"gosanke\" (except Mito-Tokugawa family) and \"gosankyō\" had priority to succeed his position. Many \"daimyōs\" descended from cadet branches of the clan, however, remained the surname Matsudaira; examples include the Matsudaira of Fukui and Aizu. Members of the Tokugawa clan intermarried with prominent daimyo and the Imperial family.\n\nOn November 9, 1867, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the 15th and the last shōgun of Tokugawa, tendered his resignation to Emperor Meiji and formally stepped down ten days later, returning governing power to the Emperor, marking the end of the ruling power of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the next year, Tokugawa Iesato (1863-1940, from Tayasu family) was chosen as the heir to Yoshinobu as the head of Tokugawa clan; in July 7, 1884, Iesato became a prince, just like the heads of some of other notable Japanese noble families, known as Kazoku. The 1946 Constitution of Japan abolished the \"kazoku\" and the noble titles, making Iesato's son, Iemasa Tokugawa, no longer a prince. Iemasa had a son Iehide, who died young, so he was succeeded by one of his grandsons, Tsunenari. Tsunenari is the second son of Toyoko (eldest daughter of Iemasa) and Ichirō Matsudaira (son of Tsuneo Matsudaira), and he is also a patrilineal descendant of Tokugawa Yorifusa, the youngest son of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\nThe Tokugawa's clan crest, known in Japanese as a \"mon\", the \"triple hollyhock\" (although commonly, but mistakenly identified as \"hollyhock\", the \"aoi\" actually belongs to the birthwort family and translates as \"wild ginger\"—\"Asarum\"), has been a readily recognized icon in Japan, symbolizing in equal parts the Tokugawa clan and the last shogunate.\n\nThe crest derives from a mythical clan, the Kamo clan, which legendarily descended from Yatagarasu. Matsudaira village was located in Higashikamo District, Aichi Prefecture. Although Emperor Go-Yōzei offered a new crest, Ieyasu continued to use the crest, which was not related to Minamoto clan.\n\nIn \"jidaigeki\", the crest is often shown to locate the story in the Edo period. And in works set in during the Meiji Restoration movement, the crest is used to show the bearer's allegiance to the shogunate—as opposed to the royalists, whose cause is symbolized by the Imperial throne's chrysanthemum crest. Compare with the red and white rose iconography of English Wars of the Roses, as imagined by Walter Scott earlier in the 19th century, in \"Anne of Geierstein\" (1829).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the First World War the brigade served on both Western Front and later the Italian Front. During the Second World War the brigade fought in Belgium and France before being evacuated to England where it remained for the rest of the war and was finally disbanded in 1946. Raised again in the 1980s, this brigade disbanded under Army 2020 in November 2014.\n\nThe Warwickshire Brigade, as this brigade was originally known, was first raised in April 1908 under the Haldane Reforms when the Territorial Force was created, which was formed by the amalgamation of the Yeomanry and Volunteer Force. The brigade was assigned to the South Midland Division, one of fourteen divisions of the peacetime Territorials. The Warwickshire Brigade was composed of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Volunteer battalions of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment.\n\nThe brigade and division were mobilised on 5 August 1914, a day after the British declaration of war on Germany, thus beginning the Great War. When asked to serve overseas (as soldiers in the TF were not obliged to serve overseas), most of the men of the brigade volunteered for Imperial Service and those who did not were left to be formed into 2nd Line battalions and brigades, forming the 2nd Warwickshire Brigade (2/5th-2/8th Royal Warwickshires) of the 2nd South Midland Division, later the 182nd (2/1st Warwickshire) Brigade, 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. The 1st Line battalions adopted the '1/' prefix (1/5th-1/8th Royal Warwickshires) to distinguish them from the 2nd Line, which adopted the '2/'.\n\nThe South Midland Division spent many months in England training until 13 March 1915 when it was warned to prepare for overseas service to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front which had suffered heavy casualties in the winter of 1914-15.\n\nOn 13 May 1915 the division was numbered, becoming the 48th (South Midland) Division and the brigades in the division were also numbered, the 1st Warwickshire Brigade became the 143rd (Warwickshire) Brigade. The brigade served throughout the Great War on the Western Front in battles at the Somme and Passchendaele. In early November 1917 the 143rd Brigade, with the rest of 48th (South Midland) Division, was sent to the Italian Front and fought at Piave River in June 1918 and later at Vittoria Veneto, which ended the war in Italy with the signing of the Armistice of Villa Giusti. Both the brigade and division ended the war in Italy.\n\n\nThe brigade and division were both disbanded in 1919 and then again reformed in 1920 as part of the Territorial Army as the 143rd (Warwickshire) Infantry Brigade and continued to serve with the 48th Division. The brigade again consisted of four battalions of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and remained this way for most of the inter-war years.\n\nHowever, in the late 1930s, there was an increasing need to strengthen the anti-aircraft defences for the cities of the United Kingdom and, as a result, many infantry battalions of the Territorial Army were subsequently converted into anti-aircraft or searchlight units. In 1936 the 5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshires was one of many selected and transferred to the Royal Engineers, becoming 45th (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, transferring to 32nd (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Group, itself part of 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. They were replaced by the 5th (Huntingdonshire) Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment, originally from the 162nd (East Midland) Infantry Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division. This battalion was previously the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Battalion of the Army Cyclist Corps.\n\nIn 1938 all infantry brigades of the British Army were reduced from four battalions to three and so the 6th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted to an anti-aircraft regiment, becoming 68th (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery, joining the 45th AA Battalion, RE (formerly the 5th Royal Warwickshires) in the 32nd (Midland) Anti-Aircraft Group, 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. In the following year the brigade was redesignated 143rd Infantry Brigade.\n\nThe 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division was mobilised on 1 September 1939, along with the rest of the Territorial Army, when the German Army launched its invasion of Poland. The Second World War began two days later, on 3 September 1939, with Britain and France declaring war on Germany. The men of the brigade were called up for full-time war service and, with the division, began training in preparation for an eventual move overseas.\n\nThe 143rd Infantry Brigade, commanded at the time by Acting Brigadier James Muirhead, a Regular Army officer, with the rest of the 48th Division was sent to France in early 1940. The brigade arrived in France on 12 January, where it became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was stationed alongside the French Army on the Franco-Belgian border. The 48th Division, commanded by Major-General Andrew Thorne, was the first complete division of the Territorial Army to be sent overseas during the Second World War. The division came under command of I Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Michael Barker, serving alongside the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions, both Regular Army formations. Due to a policy within the BEF of integrating the Regular Army with the Territorials, the 5th (Huntingdonshire) Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment was sent to 11th Brigade of the 4th Division and exchanged for the 1st Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a Regular Army unit.\n\nWith the rest of the division, the 143rd Brigade fought in the battles of Belgium and France in May–June 1940 against the German Army but was forced to retreat to Dunkirk, where the 143rd Brigade in particular fought in the battle of the Ypres-Comines Canal. With the rest of the BEF, most of the brigade and division were evacuated to England after the Germans threatened to cut off the BEF from the main French Armies which would likely have caused the annihilation of the BEF.\n\nThe brigade and division were successfully evacuated, yet had suffered extremely heavy casualties (8th Royal Warwicks had been reduced to 8 officers and 134 ORs) and had to be completely reformed and brought up to strength with conscripts. Until late 1941 the division was on home defence, training in preparation for a possible German invasion of England. The invasion, fortunately, never arrived due to events that occurred during the Battle of Britain as German intentions turned to the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 20 December 1942, the division was reduced to a Lower Establishment and the division, now the 48th Infantry (Reserve) Division, became a reserve training formation in the United Kingdom and the brigade was redesignated 143rd Infantry (Reserve) Brigade. The brigade remained in this role for the rest of the war, supplying drafts of replacements for the divisions fighting overseas. The brigade and division were both disbanded after the war in 1946 when it was finally disbanded.\n\nThe 143rd Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:\n\nThe following officers commanded 143rd Infantry Brigade during the war:\n\nThe brigade was disbanded after the Second World War and not reformed in the Territorial Army in 1947. The brigade was re-raised in 1984, moving to Shrewsbury in 1986.\n\nIn 1991, it took on responsibility for the Army in Shropshire, Staffordshire, Hereford and Worcester, Warwickshire and the West Midlands. With the disbandment of 5th Division, 143 (West Midlands) Brigade came under the control of the new Support Command based in Aldershot, in April 2012. 11 Signal Brigade and 143 (West Midlands) Brigade amalgamated to form 11th Signal Brigade and Headquarters West Midlands in November 2014. A few remaining elements of the former brigade moved to MoD Donnington in 2015.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2019833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019833", "title": "East African Rift", "text": "East African Rift\n\nThe East African Rift (EAR) or East African Rift System (EARS) is an active continental rift zone in East Africa. The EAR began developing around the onset of the Miocene, 22–25 million years ago. In the past it was considered to be part of a larger Great Rift Valley that extended north to Asia Minor.\n\nThe rift, a narrow zone, is a developing divergent tectonic plate boundary where the African Plate is in the process of splitting into two tectonic plates, called the Somali Plate and the Nubian Plate, at a rate of annually. As extension continues, lithospheric rupture will occur within 10 million years; the Somali Plate will break off and a new ocean basin will form.\n\nA series of distinct rift basins, the East African Rift System extends over thousands of kilometers. The EAR consists of two main branches. The Eastern Rift Valley (also known as Gregory Rift) includes the Main Ethiopian Rift, running eastward from the Afar Triple Junction, which continues south as the Kenyan Rift Valley. The Western Rift Valley includes the Albertine Rift, and farther south, the valley of Lake Malawi. To the north of the Afar Triple Junction, the rift follows one of two paths: west to the Red Sea Rift or east to the Aden Ridge in the Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe EAR runs from the Afar Triple Junction in the Afar Triangle of Ethiopia through eastern Africa, terminating in Mozambique. The EAR transects through Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique. It also runs offshore of the coast of Mozambique along the Kerimba and Lacerda grabens, which are joined by the Davie Ridge, a relic fracture zone that cuts across the West Somali basin, straddling the boundary between Tanzania and Mozambique. The Davie Ridge ranges between wide, with a west-facing scarp (east-plunging arch) along the southern half of its length that rises to above the sea floor. Its movement is concurrent with the EAR.\n\nOver time, many theories have tried to clarify the evolution of the East African Rift. In 1972 it was proposed that the EAR was not caused by tectonic activity, but rather by differences in crustal density. Since the 1990s, evidence has been found in favor of mantle plumes beneath the EAR. Others proposed an African superplume causing mantle deformation. The question is still debated.\n\nThe most recent and accepted view is the theory put forth in 2009: that magmatism and plate tectonics have a feedback with one another, controlled by oblique rifting conditions. At that time it was suggested that lithospheric thinning generated volcanic activity, further increasing the magmatic processes at play such as intrusions and numerous small plumes. These processes further thin the lithosphere in saturated areas, forcing the thinning lithosphere to behave like a mid-ocean ridge.\n\nAlthough reasonably considered, the exact conformation of deep-rooted mantle plumes is still a matter of active research. Studies that contribute to the broader understanding on the evolution of rifts can be grouped into the techniques of isotope geochemistry, seismic tomography and geodynamical modeling.\n\nThe varying geochemical signatures of a suite of Ethiopian lavas suggest multiple plume sources: at least one of deep mantle origin, and one from within the subcontinental lithosphere. In accordance, a study of Halldórsson et al. in 2014 compare the geochemical signature of rare Earth's isotopes from xenoliths and lava samples collected in the EAR. The results corroborate the coexistence of a superplume “common to the entire rift” with another mantle material source being either of subcontinental type or of mid-ocean ridge type.\n\nThe geophysical method of seismic tomography is a suitable tool to investigate Earth's subsurface structures deeper than the crust. It is an inverse problem technique that models which are the velocities of the inner Earth that reproduce the seismographic data recorded all around the world. Recent improvements of tomographic Earth models of P-wave and S-wave velocities suggest that a superplume upwelling from the lower mantle at the northeastern EAR feeds plumes of smaller scale into the upper mantle.\n\nParallel to geological and geophysical measures (e.g. isotope ratios and seismic velocities) it is constructive to test hypotheses on computer based geodynamical models. A 3D numerical geodynamical model of the plume-crust coupling was capable of reproducing the lateral asymmetry of the EAR around the Tanzania craton. Numerical modeling of plume-induced continental break-up shows two distinct stages, crustal rifting followed by lithospheric breakup, and the upwelling between stages of an upper mantle plume.\n\nPrior to rifting, enormous continental flood basalts erupted on the surface and uplift of the Ethiopian, Somali, and East African plateaus occurred. The first stage of rifting of the EAR is characterized by rift localization and magmatism along the entire rift zone. Periods of extension alternated with times of relative inactivity. There was also the reactivation of a pre-Cambrian weakness in the crust, a suture zone of multiple cratons, displacement along large boundary faults, and the development of deep asymmetric basins. The second stage of rifting is characterized by the deactivation of large boundary faults, the development of internal fault segments, and the concentration of magmatic activity towards the rifts.\n\nToday, the narrow rift segments of the East African Rift system form zones of localized strain. These rifts are the result of the actions of numerous normal faults which are typical of all tectonic rift zones. As aforementioned, voluminous magmatism and continental flood basalts characterize some of the rift segments, while other segments, such as the Western branch, have only very small volumes of volcanic rock.\n\nThe African continental crust is generally cool and strong. Many cratons are found throughout the EAR, such as the Tanzania and Kaapvaal cratons. The cratons are thick, and have survived for billions of years with little tectonic activity. They are characterized by greenstone belts, tonalites, and other high-grade metamorphic lithologies. The cratons are of significant importance in terms of mineral resources, with major deposits of gold, antimony, iron, chromium and nickel.\n\nA large volume of continental flood basalts erupted during the Oligocene, with the majority of the volcanism coinciding with the opening of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden approximately 30 Ma. The composition of the volcanics are a continuum of ultra-alkaline to tholeiitic and felsic rocks. It has been suggested that the diversity of the compositions could be partially explained by different mantle source regions. The EAR also cuts through old sedimentary rocks deposited in ancient basins.\n\nThe East African Rift Zone includes a number of active as well as dormant volcanoes, among them: Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya, Mount Longonot, Menengai Crater, Mount Karisimbi, Mount Nyiragongo, Mount Meru and Mount Elgon, as well as the Crater Highlands in Tanzania. Although most of these mountains lie outside of the rift valley, the EAR created them.\n\nActive volcanos include Erta Ale, DallaFilla, and Ol Doinyo Lengai, the former of which is a continuously active basaltic shield volcano in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia. When DallaFilla erupted in 2008 it was the largest volcanic eruption in Ethiopia in recorded history. The Ol Doinyo Lengai volcano is currently the only active natrocarbonatite volcano in the world. The magma contains almost no silica, making the flow viscosity extremely low. “Its lava fountains crystallize in midair then shatter like glass” according to the National Geographic. Approximately 50 volcanic structures in Ethiopia alone have documented activity since the onset of the Holocene.\n\nThe EAR is the largest seismically active rift system on Earth today. The majority of earthquakes occur near the Afar Depression, with the largest earthquakes typically occurring along or near major border faults. Seismic events in the past century are estimated to have reached a maximum moment magnitude of 7.0. The seismicity trends parallel to the rift system, with a shallow focal depth of beneath the rift axis. Further away from the rift axis, focal depths can reach depths of over . Focal mechanism solutions strike NE and frequently demonstrate normal dip-slip faults, although left-lateral motion is also observed.\n\nThe Rift Valley in East Africa has been a rich source of hominid fossils that allow the study of human evolution. The rapidly eroding highlands quickly filled the valley with sediments, creating a favorable environment for the preservation of remains. The bones of several hominid ancestors of modern humans have been found here, including those of \"Lucy\", a partial australopithecine skeleton discovered by anthropologist Donald Johanson dating back over 3 million years. Richard and Mary Leakey have done significant work in this region also. \nMore recently, two other hominid ancestors have been discovered here: a 10-million-year-old ape called \"Chororapithecus abyssinicus\", found in the Afar rift in eastern Ethiopia, and \"Nakalipithecus nakayamai\", which is also 10 million years old.\n\n"}

The United States military maintained a large base in Kingaroy and had many bases and camps throughout south-east Queensland. It actively encouraged the widespread planting of the beans.

Although other structures are located within the area, the location is today associated almost exclusively (and indeed, most synonymously) with the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III.\n\nJust left of the entrance to the \"Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III\" is the \"Temple of Amun\", (Ancient Egyptian: \"Djeser Set\") dating to the 18th Dynasty, built by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. It has undergone many alterations and modifications over the years, partially in the 20th, 25th, 26th, 29th and 30th Dynasties and the Greco-Roman period.\n\nThe temple, some long, is of orthodox design, and resembles closely the \"mortuary temple of Ramesses II\" (the Ramesseum). It is quite well preserved and surrounded by a massive mudbrick enclosure, which may have been fortified. The original entrance is through a fortified gate-house, known as a \"migdol\" (and resembling an Asiatic fortress).\n\nJust inside the enclosure, to the south, are chapels of Amenirdis I, Shepenupet II and Nitiqret, all of whom had the title of Divine Adoratrice of Amun.\n\nThe first pylon leads into an open courtyard, lined with colossal statues of Ramesses III as Osiris on one side, and uncarved columns on the other. The second pylon leads into a peristyle hall, again featuring columns of Ramses III. This leads up a ramp that leads (through a columned portico) to the third pylon and then into the large hypostyle hall (which has lost its roof).\n\nIn Coptic times, there was a church inside the temple structure, but it has since been removed. Some of the carvings in the main wall of the temple have been altered by Coptic carvings.\n\nLocated just north of the \"Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III\", right up to the mud-brick wall that surrounds it, lies the badly preserved Temple of Ay & Horemheb.\n\n"}

Kulenović family was a Muslim land-owning family, though Skender's parents ran a rented hotel and a grocery shop. Skender was the third of four sons (one of whom died in infancy) and one daughter. In 1921, impoverished by the land reforms brought in by the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia, his family moved to the central Bosnian town of Travnik, his mother's birthplace. Here Skender Kulenović became a day-boy at the \"Jezuitska klasična gimnazija\" (the local Jesuit Grammar School). Here too, he wrote his first poems, culminating in the publication of a set of sonnets (\"Ocvale primule\", or \"Withered Primroses\") in a 1927–28 school almanac.\n\nIn 1930, the Kulenović family recovered a little of their former prosperity – enough to enable Skender and his sister Ćamila to continue their education. Skender registered to study law at Zagreb University – the main reason, as he admitted, being that the Law Faculty allowed students to do the bulk of their studying at home. When in Zagreb he became inspired by leftist ideas, joining the Yugoslav Communist Party (KPJ) of which his elder brother, the painter Muhamed Kulenović, was already a member, in 1935. In the same year he gave up his law studies to focus on journalism and literary work. Over the next four years he published essays and short stories in various journals, including \"Putokaz\" (\"Signpost\"), a journal of which he was a founder member.\n\nThis was a time of increasing political tension in the first Yugoslav state. Externally, the authoritarian Regency of Prince Pavle was trying to balance popular pro-French and pro-British sentiments with a need to maintain good relations with the country's Fascist Italian and Nazi German neighbours. Internally, political life was becoming increasingly dominated by Serb-Croat hostility; in 1939, a vain attempt was made to defuse this by imposing a bipartite federal system, under which most of Bosnia became Croatian territory. In late 1939 or early 1940, Skender Kulenović was expelled from the KPJ for having refused to sign an open letter criticising the government and advocating autonomy for Bosnia and Herzegovina – a decision which prevented him from publishing in many of the journals he had worked with until then. In 1940 he married his first wife, Ana Prokop.\n\nIn March and April 1941, Prince Pavle's balancing act finally failed: he was deposed in a popular pro-Western military coup, upon which the Nazis invaded and occupied Yugoslavia. Muhamed Kulenović was immediately imprisoned as a KPJ member; in July, he was shot after an escape attempt. In November the same year, Skender joined Josip Broz Tito’s Partisans, and was readmitted into the Communist Party. In 1942, just after the German summer offensive had narrowly failed to wipe out the Partisan army, he composed perhaps his most famous poem, “Stojanka Majka Knežopoljka” (“Stojanka, the mother from Knežopolje”), a modernist Partisan version of the traditional Bosnian lament with strong elements of the Serbian folk-epic. In the same year, Skender's remaining brother Muzafer was executed in Belgrade.\n\nWhile in the Partisan forces, Kulenović also edited various newspapers and journals, continued to publish, and helped set up a theatre group. It was here, in 1944, that he fell in love with Vera Crvenčanin, who was to become his second wife. In 1945, Skender Kulenović was appointed Drama Director of the National Theatre in newly liberated Sarajevo. In 1947 he and Vera moved to Belgrade, which was to remain their home until his death. The postwar years he devoted largely to drama and journalism: he wrote several successful theatre plays, but also a number of short stories, essays and poems, and edited various literary and non-literary journals. In 1954, after having published an essay by the dissident Milovan Đilas, he was sacked as editor of the journal \"Nova misao (New Thought)\". Though he was to continue with his theatrical work, this, with the death of his father in the same year, dealt a severe blow to his confidence and self-esteem.\n\nKulenović's long contact with the city of Mostar began in 1956, when he stayed there during the production of his play \"Djelidba (Division)\". In 1959 he published “Stećak”, the first of his forty Sonnets. He also traveled to Egypt, which inspired a series of travelogues – and, later, the sonnet \"Vaze\" (Vases). 1968 saw the publication of the first twenty \"Soneti (Sonnets)\". \"Soneti II\", the second set of twenty sonnets, followed in 1974. In 1977 his novel \"Ponornica (Lost River)\" appeared. He was working on a sequel when he fell ill late that year. After one last stay in Mostar, he returned to Belgrade in January 1978, when he died of heart failure.\n\nHe was featured on the 0.50 Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark bill, which has been withdrawn from circulation and replaced with coins.\n\nKulenović's life story is in many ways typical of a Bosnian-born intellectual of the Yugoslav age: born into a Bosnian Muslim family, educated in the Catholic tradition and living in the Serbian capital. Just as his political ethos was one of pan-Yugoslav unity in Tito's communism, so his cultural roots were embedded in the Ottoman, Croatian and Serbian traditions equally. Some Bosniaks and Serbs categorise him as a Bosniak poet and a Serbian poet respectively – a tendency which, the Sarajevo critic Ivan Lovrenović claims, \"diminishes and degrades\" the status of Kulenović and writers like him. One might also say, however, that his roots in all three traditions makes him a Bosnian (rather than a Bosniak) poet par excellence, for these were the three traditions that form the weft of culture in Bosnia. But this does not prevent him from also being seen as a Yugoslav poet – or, more precisely, as one culturally at home throughout the Serbo-Croat speaking region.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2019849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019849", "title": "Supervixens", "text": "Supervixens\n\nSupervixens is a 1975 American sexploitation film directed by American filmmaker Russ Meyer. The cast features Meyer regulars Charles Napier, Uschi Digard, and Haji. The film also features Shari Eubank (in a dual role) in one of her only two film roles ever and Christy Hartburg in her only film role ever.\n\nGas station attendant Clint Ramsey, who works at \"Martin Bormann's Super Service\" in the desert, finds himself too irresistible to a series of girls, all of whom have the word \"Super\" in their given names. In the beginning, he is married to the hypersexual, demanding, and jealous SuperAngel (Shari Eubank), who constantly harasses him at work. She orders him home at once when she calls Clint and overhears a female customer, SuperLorna (Christy Hartburg), hitting on him at work. Clint finds SuperAngel's constant accusations and arguing a turn-off and, back at home, they fight after he rejects her aggressive advances. A neighbor calls the police as Clint leaves for a local bar, where the bartender is the very scantily clad SuperHaji (Haji).\n\nMeanwhile, SuperAngel seduces Harry Sledge (Charles Napier), the cop who responded to the police call. He is impotent and unable to perform. She repeatedly taunts and insults him over this, which finally results in him killing her by stomping her brutally in a bathtub, then throwing a radio in the water which was plugged into the wall socket. Sledge burns down the house, then tries to pin the murder on Clint. Clint claims being in the pub all night, but SuperHaji has her revenge on him (for insulting her breast size earlier) by refusing to confirm his alibi. Clint is then forced to flee.\n\nIn his rush to escape, Clint hitchhikes a ride from a boy (John LaZar) and his girlfriend SuperCherry (Colleen Brennan). During the drive, SuperCherry comes on to him and puts his hand over her breast, but then pulls it back. She then tries to give him a handjob over his pants, but he continues to resist her advances. The driver takes offense to Clint rejecting his girlfriend, but she says he probably just wants a closer contact. She again attempts and fails to seduce him and he asks the driver to let him get out. The driver follows him out and beats and robs him. Clint is found by an old farmer who takes him to his farm to heal from his injuries and Clint agrees to work for the farmer for a week to repay him.\n\nThe farmer has a younger Austrian mail-order bride, SuperSoul (Uschi Digard), who is hypersexual. After energetically satisfying her husband, she comes knocking on Clint's door at night. She immediately pushes him into his bed where she proceeds to mount and rape him, until he manages to overpower her. However, she does the same the following day and this time overpowering him after jumping him from behind in the barn. Looking for SuperSoul, the farmer finds them in the barn, then chases Clint away and punches SuperSoul.\n\nFleeing from the farm, Clint meets a motel owner and his deaf daughter, SuperEula (Deborah McGuire), who convinces him to take a ride with her in her dune buggy to have sex in the desert. They are caught by her father and chased out of town.\n\nClint eventually meets up with SuperVixen (also played by Shari Eubank) at \"Supervixen's Oasis\", a roadside diner. SuperVixen is (inexplicably) a friendly and giving reincarnation of SuperAngel, whose ghost now appears nude between scenes to comment on the plot from atop a bedspring balanced on a mesa. Clint and SuperVixen fall in love and are inseparable, although their common nemesis, Harry Sledge, arrives on the scene and plots ending the lives of the now happy couple.\n\n\nMeyer's previous two films had failed at the box office - \"The Seven Minutes\" (1971) was a straight drama about censorship, done for 20th Century Fox, and \"Blacksnake\" (1973) was a blaxploitation film. He originally intended to follow this with \"Foxy\" starring his then-wife Edy Williams but the marriage ended and \"I just couldn't picture myself making twenty films starring Edy Williams\". He was also worried about the Supreme Court decision against pornography.\n\n\"Those years were very confusing to me,\" said Meyer. \"But instead of rushing off and throwing myself out the window, I was able to psychoanalyze myself and discern what was best for me. I looked myself square in the face and realized I couldn't do everything.\"\n\nMeyer decided to return to the parody sex comedies which had made his reputation so he made what he described as a \"sort of sequel\" to his 1968 hit \"Vixen\".\n\n\"I'm back to big bosoms, square jaws, lotsa action and the most sensational sex you ever saw,\" he said. \"I'm back to what I do best - erotic, comedic sex, sex, sex - and I'll never stray again.\"\n\n\"I don't want to do too much yakking,\" he said. \"If there was too much plot, too much dialogue, the story would get in the way of the action. I want a film like an Al Capp cartoon where you know right off wh's good and who's bad.\"\n\"I'm gonna really deliver on this film.\" Censors were cracking down on sexually explicit films at the time but Meyer said, \"I'll do the things I've always done. I'll do everything I can to outwit them. I'll supersaturate it with outrageous bosoms.\" I used John LaZar, who was Superwoman in Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. He plays Cal McKinney, and he and Supercherry are a couple of muggers and they mug Clint. Then I had O’Luke, who was in Mudhoney, Stu Lancaster, married to Uschi Digard, who was an Austrian wife and giant — well, they’re all giant-busted women in the picture, which I think makes the send-up. Every chick he meets is like — “Oh Christ, here we go again!” So she’s Supersoul and she speaks essentially in German, and she’s probably the most aggressive woman in the picture, of the seven. She's just totally — she does two things: she's either milking the cow with a giant udder, or she’s rapaciously taking her old man, out in the fields, wherever the case may be. And then there's a sequence where she attacks, rapes, literally consumes a young man in a manger, screaming, shouting German, describing explicitly what she’s doing and how it feels. Then we have a black girl who’s built like the rest, and she’s dumb, she can’t speak, she uses sign language. But she has a white father, and we never explain that. She’s Supereula.\n\n\"There's a new chick every ten minutes,\" said Meyer. \"And each chick is more outrageously constructed than the next.\"\n\nAt one stage Meyer was reportedly making the film for American International Pictures.\n\nMeyer said he planned to shoot the film in R-rated and X-rated versions. He would release the R version, then later release a more explicit X-rated version. However the film would not include hard core sex. \"I don't criticise hard core\", he said. \"I just don't dig it.\"\n\nMeyer said the film \"was a little bit autobiographical\" but also which \"borrowed liberally from a number of people I knew\".\n\nHe said he was also influenced by the stories of Horatio Alger. \"They were always about a young man who was totally good, and he would always set out to gain his fortune and he would always come up against terrible people,\" said Meyer. \"They did everything they could to do him in, but he fought fair, you know, and he always survived and succeeded in the end. So, that's just one facet of the thing.\"\n\nMeyer flew to the Mauna Kea Hotel in Hawaii in September 1973 and wrote the script. It was the first screenplay he wrote entirely by himself and he did the first draft in eight days. Meyer says he rewrote it nine times, with input of the actors. \"I think actors contribute to the comfort of words because it's one thing to sit in a little green room somewhere and write dialogue, but when you hear actors speaking it, it doesn't necessarily flow as well as it might,\" said Meyer.\n\nThe two main female characters in the film were Superangel and Supervixen. \"Superangel, she's totally bad but beautiful,\" said Meyer. \"Supervixen, she's totally good. They're bookends. I like bookend constructions.\"\n\n\"I set out to make a picture that I thought might compete favorably with today's market in keeping with what I had done heretofore,\" he added. \"And you know, crowded on one side by hardcore films and on the other side by major product that is very explicit. Heretofore, always, I had one super female in the film. This time, I said I was going to have seven. And we'd bring one in every reel, like a new linebacker. And I think it works, it really works. You don't have time to grow tired of the looks or the actions of one girl, for example.\"\n\nMeyer used names of characters from his previous films, \"except the girls are all called “Super” and they play it straight.\"\n\nMeyer said Supervixen wearing white was a tribute to \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\". \"She's good, pure.\" He wanted to hint that Superangel maybe did not die in the bathtub but wound up reincarnated:\nGuiding the destinies of three people: terrible, nasty, dirty, nogood Harry Sledge, policeman, former green beret, redneck, opinionated, a bum lay, sexually sick, very physical, very muscular; and Clint, clean, slim, obviously a stud but not in a pushy, forward kind of way, totally good; and Supervixen, voluptuous, pure, good, totally giving, self-sacrificing.\n\nThe cast included Charles Napier, who had appeared in a number of Meyer films but quit acting to become a journalist for a trucking magazine. Meyer brought him out of retirement to do the film.\n\nThere were a number of other actors who had appeared in earlier Meyer films like John LaZar, O’Luke, Stu Lancaster, and Uschi Digard.\n\nIn March 1974, scenes were shot at the Crest Motel and the Sultan's Den in Blythe, California, before the crew finished filming in Quartzsite, Arizona. A dune buggy scene was filmed in the Quartzsite area the past month.\n\nThe film featured a murder scene which was the most violent yet depicted in a Meyer film. \"My films have to please me, to entertain me, and I really dig violence,\" said Meyer. \"I think it's very entertaining. Of course, I like to involve sex with it - sex with gusto - that's my style.\"\n\nThe official budget was $400,000 but Meyer said he deliberately inflated this figure.\n\nThe film was Meyer's biggest commercial success since \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\", making $8.2 million during its initial theatrical run.\n\n\"It's wonderful to come back and find that my kind of voluptuous, superbosumy LA Rams-Chicago Bears scrimmage kind of put on sex is perfectly\nacceptable to the mainstream,\" he said. \"People want to be amused, entertained and that's what I'm giving 'em.\"\n\nMeyer called it \"a very good film\" although \"people kept asking, \"Why did you have to have that bathtub murder,\" when really the success of the film was the bathtub scene, since there was so little sex in the picture. After a tour of Ivy League colleges and after showing it in Europe, it was clear to me that in the two weeks before its national release I had to interject some more sex. And I did, fortunately. Otherwise I don't think it would have performed as well as it did. But it wouldn't have worked as an R. The audience smells that. You lift a whole sequence out and they won't come.\"\n\nMeyer also said later the thought \"the film wouldn't have had the success it had\" without Napier \"in spite of the big boobs and seven girls. Napier, I think, has a quality that few actors possess: Wallace Beery, Borgnine, Alan Hale. There can be just a thin edge separating evil and humor and they work both sides of that line.\"\nThe British version of the film cut a moment where Napier stomped on a woman after killing her in a bath.\n\nThe R-rated version removed the bathtub murder. \"I wouldn't do it again,\" said Meyer.\n\nAfter the film came out Meyer said \"I plan to stick to what I know works and make one X picture after the next and be even more outrageous with sex and keep pushing the boundaries further and further.\"\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"looks sort of ritualistic, sort of perfunctory, made up of actions whose original meaning and purpose have been forgotten ... 'Supervixens' is a curio for film buffs.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film one star out of four and wrote that \"Meyer has lost the sense of humor that occasionally made his films enjoyable. The humor has been replaced with repulsive amounts of violence.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said Meyer explored \"as never before to such an extent the dark underside of his erotic myths. It's 'Supervixens,' not 'The Day of the Locust,' that's genuinely apocalyptic.\"\n\nAs a groundbreaker cultural revolutionaire, Meyer was ever watchful for adding sly remarks about American Society. Especially insightful are these:\n\n\nEdy Williams, Myer's ex-wife, later sued unsuccessfully for a portion of the film's profits.\n\n\n\n \n"}

It has a population of approximately 2,000.\nSt Ippolyts is located in between the A602 (Stevenage Road) and the B656 (Codicote Road), south-east of Hitchin, Hertfordshire. It lies approximately above sea level in a gap in the Chiltern Hills.\n\nSome features of the village are a 17th-century gabled house, a timber-framed house formerly known as the Olive Branch Inn, and a 16th-century house built around an even older timbered house.\n\nThe name of St Ippolyts, although spelled in a variety of ways, is derived from St Hippolytus to whom the village church was dedicated. According to Daphne Rance in her book on the parish \"St. Ippolyts: a country parish in the nineteenth century\" (1987) at various times also known as Epolites, Pallets, Nipples or St Ibbs. In the same vein, the 1881 census mentions the following 28 place names, all of which are believed to refer to it: Iplits, Ipolits, Ipollitts, Ipollyts, Ipolytes, Ipolyts, Ippatyts, Ipplits, Ipployts, Ipplyts, Ippolett, Ippoletts, Ippolits, Ippolitss, Ippolits, Ippolitss, Ippolitts, Ippollit, Ippollits, Ippollitts, Ippollyts, Ippollytts, Ippololits, Ippolts, Ippolytis, Ippolyts, Ippolytts, Ippoplitts.\n\nThe church was built in 1087 in a beautiful setting on the hillside above the village. According to the church records, the building was funded by grants supplied by Judith de Lens, the niece of William the Conqueror. De Lens gave evidence against her husband, a Saxon Earl, which led to his execution. The funding of the church was an attempt to make amends for this act. The church was rebuilt in the mid nineteenth century using old materials 'recycled' from the nearby abandoned Minsden Chapel. Apart from St Ippolyts, the church also serves the nearby villages of Gosmore and Langley.\n\nThe noted theologian Fenton John Anthony Hort (Fenton Hort) is amongst the former vicars of St Ippolyts church where he stayed for 15 years before taking up a fellowship and lectureship at Emmanuel College in Cambridge .\n\nPolitician George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd (1879-1941) was buried in the churchyard.\n\nThe ancient manor of Almshoe, mentioned in the Domesday Book, is located in the south of the parish.

Despite not achieving the level of success that Def America had hoped for, Wolfsbane played from clubs to larger venues during the late 1980s and early 1990s with several notable acts, including Iron Maiden, Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Anthrax, Overkill, Sepultura, Kreator, Sepultura, Dark Angel, King Diamond, Magnum, The Almighty, The Wildhearts, The Quireboys, among others.\n\nBeing an English band, signed to an American record label did not work out well for them. Def American dropped Wolfsbane as they felt that the band were not selling well enough. This did not stop the band from being voted as the UK's best unsigned act in 1993. The same year, the band released a live album, \"Massive Noise Injection\", through the Bronze Company label.\n\nThe band released their third studio album, often considered to be the band's best work, the self-titled \"Wolfsbane\", in 1994, again on the Bronze Company label. A limited edition of this album included the EP \"Everything Else\". However, when Bruce Dickinson left Iron Maiden, Blaze Bayley got the audition as their new singer and left Wolfsbane later on that year. Wolfsbane disbanded as a result.\n\nJason Edwards, Jeff Hateley, and Steve Danger, the remaining members of Wolfsbane, joined with Jez 'Spencer' Housden to form the band Stretch in 1995. They released a 6-track mini-album \"World of Stretch\" on the Cottage Industry label.\n\nWolfsbane had a loyal fan base which they referred to as the HMS (Howling Mad Shitheads) which adorned many of the band's T-shirts.\n\nOn 9 September 2007, Wolfsbane reformed for a one off short set at the Rock of Ages Festival in Tamworth. This was followed by their first UK tour in 13 years, with the band playing five dates as support for the Wildhearts in December 2007. Their next tour came in December 2009 supporting the Quireboys on their 'A Little Bit of What You Fancy 20th Anniversary Tour'.\n\nJason Edwards is currently a record producer, having most recently produced and mixed the self titled Wildhearts album and the Blaze Bayley album \"Promise and Terror\". He also mixed two tracks on Ginger Wildheart's \"555\" album and recorded and produced two bonus tracks for Ginger's Hey! Hello! project as well as mixing tracks for German punk band Radio Dead Ones. He is also one of three guitarists in Ginger & the Sonic Circus (project of Ginger, songwriter/frontman of the Wildhearts), and plays guitar for the God Damn Whores, alongside 'Random' Jon Poole (formerly of Cardiacs, previously stand-in bassist for the Wildhearts and also in the Sonic Circus), Denzel (also of the Sonic Circus), and Robochrist.\n\nBlaze Bayley subsequently left Iron Maiden and embarked on a career with his own band, BLAZE and later a new line-up with the Blaze Bayley Band. During Blaze Bayley's tour in support of his then new album, \"Promise and Terror\", tensions rose within the band. In the end of May 2010, both manager Anna Di Laurenzi and drummer Larry Paterson left the band to join Sinocence who had been the support band on the first leg of the tour. A couple of weeks later, in early June, Wolfsbane announced that they would be reuniting full-time and release a new album in 2011. Blaze Bayley continues to perform as a solo artist alongside singing with Wolfsbane.\n\nOn 12 March 2011, it was announced that Wolfsbane would release the EP, \"Did It for the Money\", on 9 April. They played a headline show at the Borderline in London on the same day the EP was released (9 April 2011). This was followed by a tour supporting Saxon, in April 2011. On 7 October 2011, it was announced that Wolfsbane would release their fourth studio album in 2012. Titled \"Wolfsbane Save the World\", it is available on the band's official website as well as via the merchandise stand on the band's upcoming tour.\n\nOn 24 October 2011, the band embarked on a UK tour. Joined by Manchester's Obsessive Compulsive as support for the tour. Footage from the 2011 UK tour can be seen on the Official Wolfsbane YouTube channel. On 15 December 2011, a video of the song \"Smoke and Red Light\" was added to the official Wolfsbane YouTube channel. The song is taken from the new album \"Wolfsbane Save the World\" and is based on the early days of the band's career.\n\nOn 17 October 2012, the band embarked on an 11 date UK tour. Special guest Givvi Flynn joined the band on stage for four of the shows to perform \"Illusion of Love\". On sale at the show was an album previously unreleased by the band entitled \"The Lost Tapes: A Secret History\". This album was only available on sale during the tour making it a limited edition issue.\n\nAs of May 2016, according to their Facebook page, Wolfsbane are working on a new album.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is now a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Television.\n\nCSC Media Group was named after the now defunct UK music show \"The Chart Show\", which ran on ITV and Channel 4 for twelve years. CSC evolved from the original Chart Show production company Video Visuals, to Chart Show Channels, which was then acquired in 2007 by private equity group Veronis Suhler Stevenson.\n\nThey own sixteen channels, all of which are advertising funded and free to air (FTA).\n\nUntil May 2005, their only output was music television, with their three fully owned music channels Chart Show TV (now Trace Urban), The Vault (now Trace Vault), and B4 (later Flava), and two children's channels Pop (previously Toons & Tunes), and Tiny Pop (previously Pop Plus), which also both screened music videos along with cartoons.\n\nIn 2006, British Sky Broadcasting sold their three music channels Bliss (previously The Amp), Scuzz, and Flaunt to CSC. Formerly encrypted, CSC made the channels FTA like the rest of their channels.\n\nIn 2007, they launched five channels; two of which were timeshift channels: Pop +1 and Tiny Pop +1. The third channel was a new children's channel called Pop Girl, aimed at a young female audience. The fourth channel was AnimeCentral, which time-shares with Pop Girl, and shows animated series for an older audience; it was the first dedicated channel in the UK for anime broadcasting. The fifth was Minx, which was a spin-off music channel from the Minx slot shown on Chart Show TV. Minx was later replaced by NME TV, which is a dedicated indie music channel.\n\nIn 2008, they rebranded B4 to Flava after showing a mix of R&B music for a few months prior to this in March. The channel also went widescreen prior to the rebrand, to match the other CSC music channels. On Tuesday 6 May, they launched Flaunt +1, a 1 hour timeshifted version of Flaunt. This was their first ever timeshifted music channel, and is also the second to launch in the UK, after MTV One +1 (now MTV +1) launched in February 2008, replacing MTV Flux. On Monday 12 May, six days after launching their first music timeshift, Bliss +1, their second music channel timeshift, was launched and their third music channel timeshift, Scuzz +1 launched in November 2008. It soon closed, and the satellite transponder space was then used by NHK World TV. On Monday 19 May, they launched their fourth kids channel, replacing Pop +1. Kix! kit started at 06:00 hours, showing a mixture of cartoons, extreme sports, as well as music, aimed for boys, similar to another kids channel, Jetix. Currently, it broadcasts from 06:00 to 23:30 daily. Pop Girl +1, a 1 hour timeshifted version of Pop Girl launched on Wednesday 4 June, replacing their first music channel timeshift, Flaunt +1, which had only been on air just short of four weeks. AnimeCentral has been replaced with Showcase TV on 27 August 2008, which simulcasts a mixture of channels such as Pop Girl, Chart Show TV, True Movies 2, along with AnimeCentral programming block with repeats of \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"\".\n\nCSC is the majority owner of Moving Movies Ltd.; with True Movies 1 being the first channel from the company, it launched on 8 April 2005, and was joined by True Movies 2 in March 2006.

{"id": "2019905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019905", "title": "Violator (comics)", "text": "Violator (comics)\n\nViolator (also referred to at times as The Violator) is a fictional supervillain, who appears in the \"Spawn\" comic books published by Image Comics. The character first appeared in \"Spawn\" #2 (cover-dated May 1992) and was created by writer-artist Todd McFarlane. He is by far the most recurring villain of the series and Spawn's archenemy. He is also the maker of the Hellspawns, hence why he trains them and keeps tabs on them.\n\nIn 2009, Violator was ranked as IGN's 97th-greatest comic book villain of all time.\n\nViolator is the oldest and most powerful of five hell-born demons known as the Phlebiac Brothers, and his main purpose is to guide Hellspawns towards fulfilling Satan's desire: to cultivate evil souls on Earth for Hell's army. He has been Hell's guide for multiple Hellspawn, his latest charge being the current Spawn, Al Simmons. However, Violator views humanity as weak and so asserts that demons should lead the armies of Hell, not Spawn. Accordingly, much of his terrestrial activities, sanctioned by Hell or not, are aimed at proving his superiority to his master. The Violator's current disguise is that of Clown, a 3'10\" overweight, balding man with menacing face-paint and four fingers in each hand. The Violator is not a demon to be taken lightly: he has shown many times that he is more than a match for a young Hellspawn. His hands are tied by his role, though, as he cannot kill a Spawn without an order from his superiors. His role is not to kill the Hellspawn, but to weaken them and cause them to waste their powers in wreaking havoc. His chief purpose is to groom and prepare the young Hellspawn for their service in Satan's army. He has been killed multiple times, each time to be returned to Hell and reanimated by his master.\n\nHis brothers turn on him at one point, sending him fleeing for his life through a New York city shopping district. He becomes briefly allied with a moral but naive vigilante.\n\nAt one point he is kept prisoner in a scientific facility seeking to weaponize his energies. Violator has to deal with an unexpected trip to hell, an insanely murderous angel and the facility's director of security, the stone-bodied Badrock.\n\nAfter suffering a humiliating defeat in Hell during Spawn's return to claim the throne of the 8th sphere, Clown reappeared on Earth on the order of Mammon to wreak havoc in Spawn's life as part of the larger plan to give Nyx an opportunity to betray Al. He was a \"mental adviser\" to Jason Wynn, his former contact and partner in the deal that cost Al Simmons his life. He helped Wynn regain his sanity and return to the NSA, but had other plans, rather than being charitable. He has assumed the dominant role in Wynn's psyche and when Wynn was vulnerable, hanging from a steel girder many stories up, he caused him to fall to his apparent death. Clown then took over Wynn's body and used it as his new vessel. He turned Wynn's body into a fanged, bloated parody of his former self. Clown then began to attack and 'mark' citizens of Rat City, turning them all into blue face-painted Clowns. It was revealed that the Violator was possessing hundreds of civilians and forcing them to run amok, committing acts of violence and vandalism, all with a smile on their faces. After their attacks brought Spawn to the brink of death, leaving him bleeding and broken on the streets of Rat City in his Al Simmons persona, the Clowns vanished. The Violator has not been seen since, but has revealed that he has been turned loose on Earth with no strings attached, and it is only a matter of time before he returns to plague Spawn anew.\n\nIn \"Spawn \"#167, a new Clown emerges, who is thin and agile, and fond of using knives. Clown hijacked the body of Barney Saunders, who had been having an affair with a married woman named Wilma Barbera. Trying to escape discovery by Wilma Barbera's husband, Barney Saunders jumped down the garbage chute only to be trapped there a couple of days before the bright light event (Spawn's destruction and recreation of the world), and was trapped in a garbage chute and doomed to be eaten alive by rats and roaches. The new Clown easily escapes and frequently uses a knife to attack his enemies. He also can still change into his demon form when he wishes.\nThe Violator is revealed to be the cause of all the havoc of an apartment complex, freeing the residents of restraint and allowing them to fulfill their desires and violent urges. This allowed the Violator to create a portal to Hell from which the other Phlebiac Brothers could enter the world. Violator is confronted by Spawn, but easily gains the upper hand in the battle. Mere moments from Violator's victory, Barney Saunder's spirit gains control when his body sees his lover Wilma. Barney Saunders decides to go through the portal into Hell, knowing that the only way to close the portal was to trap himself and Clown on the other side while he could still maintain control over his body. Barney reveals that he was angry at his lover for not coming to save him when he was starving in the garbage chute and takes her with him, stranding The Violator, Saunders and Wilma in Hell.\n\nClown has recently reappeared in New York City (how he escaped from Hell is unknown). It is Clown who finds the decapitated body of Spawn in the alleys, and it is he who tries to mask the dead zone created after Spawn's suicide. Clown tries hard to keep the Spawn's death a secret and kills anyone aware of the Spawn's demise. Clown plans to put together his own army to bring down the kingdom of Heaven (against the wishes of the \"Elders\", supposedly very powerful rulers of Hell). He travels to Connecticut to enlist the help of a fellow demon who now assumes the life of a human and is married to a human as well. Clown tries to convince the fellow demon (who has not yet been named) to join his own private army, but to no avail. Unfortunately for the nameless demon, Clown is not going to take \"no\" for an answer. Clown gives the man two days to get his affairs in order before departing. The man, still defiant, looks in his cabinet to find the severed heads of his prize winning dogs and a note from Clown reading, \"I'm not Clowning around!\".\n\nClown is absent for a while, but then reappears in New York City to find an Angel crucified to a wall (done so by the newly ordained Hellspawn). He is unaware that there is already a new Hellspawn and asks the Angel who pinned her to the wall, as he beats her with a crowbar. She laughs at his lack of knowledge about \"What your side is doing, Mr. Clown,\" which angers Clown. He gives her a reason to fear him as he contorts his Clown face into that of the Violator. She says she is unafraid, to which he replies, \"There are worse things than death, especially for an Angel\"; he then tears the wings from the helpless Angel's back.\n\nAfter Jim and the Freak arrive on the scene, the Violator reveals himself. Though the Violator tells Jim he has the answers he seeks, it is made clear by the Freak that the Violator is not on his side. When confronted by the truth, the Violator threatens Jim and the Freak. Before Jim can get any information from Violator, he retreats deeper into the alleys. The Violator goes to \"slaughter someone who could endanger my plans\". In the next scene, the Violator is switching between his two forms in order to trick Jim, pretending the Violator is fighting Clown.\n\nClown emerges and claims that he has dispatched the Violator. The Freak curses Clown and then retreats in fear. Clown and Jim are left alone. Clown explains a little about Jim's newfound power; that his costume is alive and that there are ways of controlling it. He then laments over the Angel's current insanity. He makes Jim believe that someone else had been behind this vile act and not he. Clown explains that he is Jim's ally and that Jim should trust him in order to find the answers he seeks. Before the two can converse any longer, Clown dashes away, telling Jim that he has an appointment and he will see Jim around.\n\nClown is nearly run down by Sam and Twitch's car, after running in front of it. Clown is then pursued by the two detectives after he urinates on their car. After being stopped by Twitch, and tackled by Sam, Clown is taken to the pair's precinct (although this was obviously Clown's plan). Clown is put into a cell with three other men. Clown sits beside and talks to the one he identifies as Claudio.\n\nHe tells Claudio that he wishes to have a conference with Claudio's boss. Claudio becomes defensive and asks why Clown thinks the boss would want to see him. Clown explains to Claudio that he is going to make his boss an offer he cannot refuse. He proclaims that now that he has found a Spawn, he plans to combine his power, Spawn's power, and Claudio's boss' power in order to make the New Unholy Trinity. Spawn 294 and 295 reveals that he had made Spawn's powers and all of the other Hellspawns.\nLater, 300 confirms that Violator was the one who killed Wanda Blake and had evolved to a point as he is now more bulky in his demon form.\n\nViolator and his siblings are New York's ad-hoc police force in the dystopia-Spawn-ruled future of 2015.\nA version of Violator also appears in the Spawn Kills everyone Too!.\n\nBeing a relatively mid-level demon within Hell's hierarchy, the Violator possesses considerable strength and resilience to injuries; enough to tear out a Hellspawn's heart with one hand and survive multiple high-caliber gunshots that would instantly kill or cripple a human being. He possess a degree of shape-changing powers, typically used to take on the appearance of \"the Clown.\" He's also shown to breathe flames and take possession of others. As with any demon, he can only be destroyed by an equal or higher power such as a Hellspawn or Heavenly weapons.\n\n\nThe character appears as the secondary antagonist in the 1997 live-action \"Spawn\" film portrayed by John Leguizamo in Clown form. His true demonic form was achieved through a combination of animatronic puppetry and CGI. He is responsible for an elaborate scheme to train Al Simmons into an assassin for a military program, and had Simmons' superior Jason Wynn betray and kill him. This leads a vengeful Simmons into agreeing to become the leader of Hell's army. Clown is frustrated that Malebolgia chose Spawn to be his general instead of him. Spawn and Violator had some kind of a rivalry. He is a constant presence in the movie, attempting to get Simmons into the path of evil. In an effort to spread chaos and destruction, he convinces Wynn to attach a device in his body that would cause an apocalyptic disaster in the event of his death. This was part of the scheme to get Simmons to destroy the world. Simmons later confronts the Violator, who turns into his true form and attacks him. The Violator fails to kill him due to the intervention of Cogliostro. Simmons later confronts Wynn and extracts the device before the Violator attacks again, dragging Spawn into a showdown in Hell. Simmons rejects his role as the leader of Hell's army, and alongside Cogliostro, fights off the Violator back on Earth, decapitating him in the end. His head, still conscious, retreats back to Hell.\n\nThe Violator appears in the Japanese manga \"Shadows of Spawn\" as well as the Spawn spin-off miniseries \"Violator\" and the crossover \"Violator/Badrock\".\n\n\n\nViolator is the subject of the song \"Violate\" by heavy metal band Iced Earth, from their Spawn-themed concept album \"The Dark Saga\".\n\nBoth the demonic and human forms of this character have been the basis for a number of action figures from McFarlane Toys.\n\nThe Violator makes an appearance on \"Angry Video Game Nerd\", where he forces the titular gamer to play video games based on the \"Spawn\" franchise. He was played by Justin Silverman.\n\n"}

The Type Two superseded the 64 ft HSL, and was itself replaced by the Type Three 68 ft \"Hants and Dorset\" also built by the BPBC. The Type Two (aka Type 2) was nicknamed the \"Whaleback\" due to the distinctive curve to its deck and humped cabin.\n\nThe Type Two was designed in 1937 by George Selman, Chief Designer and Naval Architect of the British Power Boat Company, which was founded by Hubert Scott-Paine at Hythe.

The mahogany hull was of the hard chine, planing type.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the retrieval of pilots and aircrew who had been shot down over, or who had had to ditch in, the sea around the British Isles was the responsibility of the Royal Air Force Marine Branch, (motto: \"The sea shall not have them\"). Rescue of downed aircrew was coordinated using RAF aircraft, aircraft operated by Coastal Command and the Royal Navy and rescue launches operated by the RAF Marine Branch and the Royal Navy.\n\nThe Type Two was supplied to RAF marine craft units from the middle of 1940. In total 69 craft were manufactured between 1940 and 1942.\n\nAfter World War II, a number of the Type Two craft were transferred to the Royal Navy and a small number were given to the Italian Air Force. The vast majority of the Type Two craft belonging to the Admiralty were subsequently stored and later sold off as houseboats. None are currently owned by any museum or trusts.\n\nFollowing their performance during the Dieppe raid in August 1942, the Type Two was modified. Extra armament was fitted – paired .303 in machine guns mounted either side of the wheel-house and a single 20 mm Oerlikon on the (strengthened) rear deck. Protection was improved by adding anti-shrapnel padding around the forward cabin area.\n\n\n"}

The population at the 2011 Census was 2,167.\n\nKimpton is mentioned in the Domesday Book: \"In the Half-Hundred of HITCHIN 24 Ralph holds KIMPTON from the Bishop. It answers for 4 hides. Land for 10 ploughs. In Lordship 2; a third possible. 2 Frenchmen and 12 villagers with 2 smallholders have 7 ploughs. 3 cottagers; 5 slaves. Meadow for 6 oxen; woodland, 800 pigs; 1 mill at 8s. The total value is and was £12; before 1066 £15. Aelfeva, mother of Earl Morcar, held this manor.\"\n\nThe manor was later held by the Hoo-Keate famiy, and then by marriage to the Dacre family. The village hall is called Lady Dacre Hall. \n\nKimpton has a spacious flint-built parish church in the unusual transitional style between Norman and Early English. The Dacre Chapel has a fine Perpendicular screen, and the remains of early wall paintings in the chancel show St Christopher and the Seven Corporal Works of Mercy.\nThe belfry contains a peal of eight bells, the oldest having been cast c.1390.\n\nThe village lies along the valley of a dried-up river bed and is about one mile long. Some of the houses on the High Street date back to the 16th century, but most are 19th and early 20th century. Behind the High Street are two large housing estates built in the 1970s.\n\nThe village has a reputation for its strong community spirit with over 50 clubs and organisations meeting regularly and helping to support the village as a whole. Every year at the beginning of May, many of these groups set up a stall on the Recreation Ground as part of the annual local fundraiser, the May Festival - an event run over three days featuring an art exhibition, craft market, stalls, arena entertainments, six mile sponsored run, walk with clues to solve, village concert, quiz, cream teas with jazz band.\n\nKimpton's most recent addition in terms of festivities is the Kimpton Folk Festival, which started in 2016, and has become widely popular in the folk community, with well-known folk acts performing in various areas of Kimpton. This thorough exploration of the folk genre is coupled with rustic and original catering meticulously selected to appeal to all palettes in order to create a truly authentic experience. Kimpton Folk Festival is organised by its parent organisation Kimpton Folk Events, which exists to promote and grow the art and science of folk culture in the wider community.\n\nThe village school is a thriving primary and nursery school with over 150 children.\n\nIn February 2001, Kimpton was hit by flooding due to an unprecedented amount of rainfall. The dried up river Kym, which was now a vital road, emerged again and followed its natural course from Netherfield Springs, through Kimpton and joined the Mimram at Kimpton Mill. The situation became fairly serious on the 24th when business owners from the Industrial Estate on Claggy road and also residents at risk hired pumps and called the Fire Brigade to try to deal with the 1-metre-deep water flow. The total cost of the damage caused by the flood was approximately £500,000. There is evidence suggesting that this is not the only flood to occur in the history of the village. There was a BBC news report on the situation.\n\n"}

It offers a beach, two fishing piers, gardens, tennis, and museums. It is run by the Newport News Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism.\n\nHuntington Park is located at the base of the Newport News side of the James River Bridge. The park spans 60 acres (243,000 m²), making it the fourth-largest park in the Newport News Parks system. There are entrances on Mercury Boulevard just before the bridge, and on the park's eastern side at Warwick Boulevard.\n\nThe park has several different activities available to visitors:\n\nFort Fun is a playground built in 1992 in the park. A community group, the Huntington Park Playground Association, was established to develop the playground in the early 1990s. The playground was designed professionally, but with significant contributions from local children on what they wanted to see in their new playground. The playground was then built as a volunteer effort - over 1,000 people contributed their time and effort to getting the playground built. The original wooden Fort Fun was replaced with a metal and plastic playground structure in 2012.\n\nThe James River Fishing Pier is a privately managed saltwater fishing pier. It utilizes what remains of the old, 2-lane James River Bridge. It is popular year-round with local fishermen. There is a charge to fish this pier, currently $8.50 for adults and $6 for children.\n\nThere is also a Children's Fishing Pier, which utilizes Lake Biggins. This is a freshwater lake located in the park.\n\nThe Huntington Park Tennis Center consists of twenty hardcourts. The courts are lighted for use at night. Several city tennis leagues are run at the Center, and instructional classes are available for all ages and skill levels. There is a tennis pro on staff at the center.\n\nA moderately sized beach is located where the park meets the James River. The beach is staffed with lifeguards from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Concessions are available.\n\nThree memorials, remembering servicemen who died in the Vietnam War, the Four Chaplains who gave up their lifejackets to save others in the sinking of the USAT Dorchester during World War II, and victims of the Holocaust, are located at the park. Huntington Park is also the location of the Virginia War Museum.\n\n"}
{"id": "2019941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019941", "title": "Micro combined heat and power", "text": "Micro combined heat and power\n\nMicro combined heat and power, micro-CHP, µCHP or mCHP is an extension of the idea of cogeneration to the single/multi family home or small office building in the range of up to 50 kW. Usual technologies for the production of heat and power in one common process are e.g. internal combustion engines, micro gas turbines, stirling engines or fuel cells.\nLocal generation has the potential for a higher efficiency than traditional grid-level generators since it lacks the 8-10% energy losses from transporting electricity over long distances. It also lacks the 10–15% energy losses from heat transport in heating networks due to the difference between the thermal energy carrier (hot water) and the colder external environment. \n\nThe most common systems use natural gas as their primary energy source and emit carbon dioxide; nevertheless the effective efficiency of CHP heat production is much higher than of a condensing boiler, and thus reducing emissions and fuel costs.\n\nA micro-CHP system usually contains a small heat engine as a prime mover used to rotate a generator which provides electric power, while simultaneously utilizing the waste heat from the prime mover for an individual building's space heating and the provision of hot domestic water. \nWith fuel cells there is no rotating machinery, but the fuel cell's stack and where applicable also the reformer will provide useful heat. The stack does generate DC power which is converted by DC/AC inverter into mains voltage. Micro-CHP is defined by the EU as being of less than 50 kW electrical power output, however, others have more restrictive definitions, all the way down to <5 kWe.\n\nA micro-CHP generator may primarily follow heat demand, delivering electricity as the by-product, or may follow electrical demand to generate electricity and use heat as the by-product. When used primarily for heating, micro-CHP systems may generate more electricity than is instantaneously being demanded, the surplus is then fed into the grid.\n\nThe purpose of cogeneration is to utilize more of the energy in the fuel. The reason for using CHP systems is that large thermal power plants which generate electric power by burning fuel produce between 40% to 60% low-temperature waste heat, due to Carnot's theorem. The temperature level (ca. 80°C - ca. 150°C) of this waste heat does allow to use it for space heating purposes, therefore in some urban areas district heating networks have been installed. Heat network have a limited extend, as it is not economical to transport heat long distances due to heat loss from the pipes, and it will not reach into areas of low population density, else revenues per CAPEX will go down. Where no district heating is possible due to low heat demand densities or the local utility did not invest in costly heat networks, this thermal energy is usually wasted via cooling tower or discharged in rivers, lakes or the sea. \n\nMicro CHP systems allow to use the principle of highly efficient cogeneration while using the waste heat even if the served heat load is rather low. This allows to spread the idea of cogeneration beyond population centers or to use this efficient energy conversion principle even if a district heating network has not arrived yet. It is efficient to generate the electricity near where also the waste heat can be used. Small power plants (µCHP) are located in individual buildings, where the waste heat can be used to support the heating system and recharge the hot domestic water tank, thus saving heating oil or heating gas. CHP systems are able to increase the total energy utilization of primary energy sources. Thus CHP has been steadily gaining popularity in all sectors of the energy economy, due to the increased costs of electricity and fuel, particularly fossil fuels, and due to environmental concerns, particularly climate change.\n\nIn a traditional power plant delivering electricity to consumers, about 34.4% of the primary energy of the input fuel, such as coal, natural gas, uranium, petroleum solar thermal, or biomass, reaches the consumer via electricity, although the efficiency can be 20% for very old plants and 45% for newer gas plants. In contrast, a CHP system converts 15%–42% of the primary heat to electricity, and most of the remaining heat is captured for hot water or space heating. In total, over 90% of the heat from the primary energy source (LHV based) can be used when heat production does not exceed the thermal demand.\n\nAfter the year 2000, micro-CHP has become cost effective in many markets around the world, due to rising energy costs. The development of micro-CHP systems has also been facilitated by recent technological developments of small heat engines. This includes improved performance and cost-effectiveness of fuel cells, Stirling engines, steam engines, gas turbines, diesel engines and Otto engines.\n\nCombined heat and power (CHP) systems for homes or small commercial buildings are usually fueled by natural gas to produce electricity and heat. If no access to the natural gas network is available, which in general is the cheapest alternative, LPG, LNG or heating fuel (diesel) might be an alternative.\nPEMFC fuel cell mCHP operates at low temperature (50 to 100 °C) and needs high purity hydrogen, its prone to contamination, changes are made to operate at higher temperatures and improvements on the fuel reformer. SOFC fuel cell mCHP operates at a high temperature (500 to 1,000 °C) and can handle different fuel sources well but the high temperature requires expensive materials to handle the temperature, changes are made to operate at a lower temperature. Because of the higher temperature SOFC in general has a longer start-up time and need continuous heat output even in times when there is no thermal demand.\n\nCHP systems linked to absorption chillers can use waste heat for refrigeration.\n\nA 2013 UK report from Ecuity Consulting stated that MCHP is the most cost-effective method of utilizing gas to generate energy at the domestic level.\n\nThe fuel cell industry review stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional engine-based micro-CHP systems in sales in 2012.\n\nMicro-CHP engine systems are currently based on several different technologies:\n\nThere are many types of fuels and sources of heat that may be considered for micro-CHP. The properties of these sources vary in terms of system cost, heat cost, environmental effects, convenience, ease of transportation and storage, system maintenance, and system life. Some of the heat sources and fuels that are being considered for use with micro-CHP include: natural gas, LPG, biomass, vegetable oil (such as rapeseed oil), woodgas, solar thermal, and lately also hydrogen, as well as multi-fuel systems. The energy sources with the lowest emissions of particulates and net-carbon dioxide include solar power, hydrogen, biomass (with two-stage gasification into biogas), and natural gas. Due to the high efficiency of the CHP process, cogeneration has still lower carbon emissions compared to energy transformation in fossil driven boilers or thermal power plants.\n\nThe majority of cogeneration systems use natural gas for fuel, because natural gas burns easily and cleanly, it can be inexpensive, it is available in most areas and is easily transported through pipelines which already exist for over 60 million homes.\n\nReciprocating internal combustion engines are the most popular type of engine used in micro-CHP systems. Reciprocating internal combustion engine based systems can be sized such that the engine operates at a single fixed speed, usually resulting in a higher electrical or total efficiency. However, since reciprocating internal combustion engines have the ability to modulate their power output by changing their operating speed and fuel input, micro-CHP systems based on these engines can have varying electrical and thermal output designed to meet changing demand.\n\nNatural gas is suitable for internal combustion engines, such as Otto engine and gas turbine systems. Gas turbines are used in many small systems due to their high efficiency, small size, clean combustion, durability and low maintenance requirements. Gas turbines designed with foil bearings and air-cooling operate without lubricating oil or coolants. The waste heat of gas turbines is mostly in the exhaust, whereas the waste heat of reciprocating internal combustion engines is split between the exhaust and cooling system.\n\nExternal combustion engines can run on any high-temperature heat source. These engines include the Stirling engine, hot \"gas\" turbocharger, and the steam engine. Both range from 10%-20% efficiency, and as of 2014, small quantities are in production for micro-CHP products.\n\nOther possibilities include the Organic Rankine cycle, which operates at lower temperatures and pressures using low-grade heat sources. The primary advantage to this is that the equipment is essentially an air-conditioning or refrigeration unit operating as an engine, whereby the piping and other components need not be designed for extreme temperatures and pressures, reducing cost and complexity. Electrical efficiency suffers, but it is presumed that such a system would be utilizing waste heat or a heat source such as a wood stove or gas boiler that would exist anyway for purposes of space heating.\n\nThe future of combined heat and power, particularly for homes and small businesses, will continue to be affected by the price of fuel, including natural gas. As fuel prices continue to climb, this will make the economics more favorable for energy conservation measures, and more efficient energy use, including CHP and micro-CHP.\n\nFuel cells generate electricity and heat as a by product. The advantages for a stationary fuel cell application over stirling CHP are no moving parts, less maintenance, and quieter operation. The surplus electricity can be delivered back to the grid.\n\nPEMFC fuel cells fueled by natural gas or propane use a steam reformer to convert methane in the gas supply into carbon dioxide and hydrogen; the hydrogen then reacts with oxygen in the fuel cell to produce electricity. A PEMFC fuel cell based micro-CHP has an electrical efficiency of 37% LHV and 33% HHV and a heat recovery efficiency of 52% LHV and 47% HHV with a service life of 40,000 hours or 4000 start/stop cycles which is equal to 10 year use. An estimated 138,000 Fuel cell CHP systems below 1 kW had been installed in Japan by the end of 2014. Most of these CHP systems are PEMFC based (85%) and the remaining are SOFC systems.\n\nIn 2013 Lifetime is around 60,000 hours. For PEM fuel cell units, which shut down at night, this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years.\n\nUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) Technical Targets: 1–10 kW residential combined heat and power fuel cells operating on natural gas.\n\nStandard utility natural gas delivered at typical residential distribution line pressures.\nRegulated AC net/lower heating value of fuel.\nOnly heat available at 80 °C or higher is included in CHP energy efficiency calculation.\nCost includes materials and labor costs to produce stack, plus any balance of plant necessary for stack operation. Cost defined at 50,000 unit/year production (250 MW in 5 kW modules).\nBased on operating cycle to be released in 2010.\nTime until >20% net power degradation.\n\nThermoelectric generators operating on the Seebeck Effect show promise due to their total absence of moving parts. Efficiency, however, is the major concern as most thermoelectric devices fail to achieve 5% efficiency even with high temperature differences.\n\nThis can be achieved by Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector, another option is Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal (CPVT), also sometimes called combined heat and power solar (CHAPS), is a cogeneration technology used in concentrated photovoltaics that produce both electricity and heat in the same module. The heat may be employed in district heating, water heating and air conditioning, desalination or process heat.\n\nCPVT systems are currently in production in Europe, with Zenith Solar developing CPVT systems with a claimed efficiency of 72%.\n\nSopogy produces a micro concentrated solar power (microCSP) system based on parabolic trough which can be installed above building or homes, the heat can be used for water heating or solar air conditioning, a steam turbine can also be installed to produce electricity.\n\nThe recent development of small scale CHP systems has provided the opportunity for in-house power backup of residential-scale photovoltaic (PV) arrays. The results of a recent study show that a PV+CHP hybrid system not only has the potential to radically reduce energy waste in the status quo electrical and heating systems, but it also enables the share of solar PV to be expanded by about a factor of five. In some regions, in order to reduce waste from excess heat, an absorption chiller has been proposed to utilize the CHP-produced thermal energy for cooling of PV-CHP system. These trigen+PV systems have the potential to save even more energy.\n\nTo date, micro-CHP systems achieve much of their savings, and thus attractiveness to consumers, by the value of electrical energy which is replaced by the autoproduced electricity. A \"generate-and-resell\" or net metering model supports this as home-generated power exceeding the instantaneous in-home needs is sold back to the electrical utility. This system is efficient because the energy used is distributed and used instantaneously over the electrical grid. The main losses are in the transmission from the source to the consumer which will typically be less than losses incurred by storing energy locally or generating power at less than the peak efficiency of the micro-CHP system. So, from a purely technical standpoint dynamic demand management and net-metering are very efficient.\n\nAnother positive to net-metering is the fact that it is fairly easy to configure. The user's electrical meter is simply able to record electrical power exiting as well as entering the home or business. As such, it records the net amount of power entering the home. For a grid with relatively few micro-CHP users, no design changes to the electrical grid need be made. Additionally, in the United States, federal and now many state regulations require utility operators to compensate anyone adding power to the grid. From the standpoint of grid operator, these points present operational and technical as well as administrative burdens. As a consequence, most grid operators compensate non-utility power-contributors at less than or equal to the rate they charge their customers. While this compensation scheme may seem almost fair at first glance, it only represents the consumer's cost-savings of not purchasing utility power versus the true cost of generation and operation to the micro-CHP operator. Thus from the standpoint of micro-CHP operators, net-metering is not ideal.\n\nWhile net-metering is a very efficient mechanism for using excess energy generated by a micro-CHP system, it does have detractors. Of the detractors' main points, the first to consider is that while the main generating source on the electrical grid is a large commercial generator, net-metering generators \"spill\" power to the smart grid in a haphazard and unpredictable fashion. However, the effect is negligible if there are only a small percentage of customers generating electricity and each of them generates a relatively small amount of electricity. When turning on an oven or space heater, about the same amount of electricity is drawn from the grid as a home generator puts out. If the percentage of homes with generating systems becomes large, then the effect on the grid may become significant. Coordination among the generating systems in homes and the rest of the grid may be necessary for reliable operation and to prevent damage to the grid.\n\nThe largest deployment of micro-CHP is in Japan in 2009 where over 90,000 units in place, with the vast majority being of Honda's \"ECO-WILL\" type. Six Japanese energy companies launched the 300 W–1 kW PEMFC/SOFC ENE FARM product in 2009, with 3,000 installed units in 2008, a production target of 150,000 units for 2009–2010 and a target of 2,500,000 units in 2030. 20,000 units where sold in 2012 overall within the Ene Farm project making an estimated total of 50,000 PEMFC and up to 5,000 SOFC installations. For 2013 a state subsidy for 50,000 units is in place. The ENE FARM project will pass 100.000 systems in 2014, 34.213 PEMFC and 2.224 SOFC were installed in the period 2012-2014, 30,000 units on LNG and 6,000 on LPG.\n\nSold by various gas companies and as of 2013, installed in a total of 131,000 homes. Manufactured by Honda using their single cylinder EXlink engine capable of burning natural gas or propane. Each unit produces 1 kW of electricity and 2.8 kW of hot water.\n\n\n\nIn South Korea, subsidies will start at 80 percent of the cost of a domestic fuel cell. The Renewable Portfolio Standard program with renewable energy certificates runs from 2012 to 2022. \nQuota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more difficult to design and implement than a Feed-in tariff. Around 350 residential mCHP units were installed in 2012.\n\n\nThe European public–private partnership Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking Seventh Framework Programme project ene.field aims to deploy by 2017 up 1,000 residential fuel cell Combined Heat and Power (micro-CHP) installations in 12 EU member states. \n\nPowercell Sweden is a fuel cell company that develop environmentally friendly electric generators with the unique fuel cell and reformer technology that is suitable for both existing and future fuel.\n\nIn Germany, ca 50 MW of mCHP up to 50 kW units have been installed in 2015. The German government is offering large CHP incentives, including a market premium on electricity generated by CHP and an investment bonus for micro-CHP units. The German testing project Callux has 500 mCHP installations per nov 2014. North Rhine-Westphalia launched a 250 million subsidy program for up to 50 kW lasting until 2017.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that about 1,000 micro-CHP systems were in operation in the UK as of 2002. These are primarily Whispergen using Stirling engines, and Senertec Dachs reciprocating engines. The market is supported by the government through regulatory work, and some government research money expended through the Energy Saving Trust and Carbon Trust, which are public bodies supporting energy efficiency in the UK. Effective as of 7 April 2005, the UK government has cut the VAT from 20% to 5% for micro-CHP systems, in order to support demand for this emerging technology at the expense of existing, less environmentally friendly technology. The reduction in VAT is effectively a 10.63% subsidy for micro-CHP units over conventional systems, which will help micro-CHP units become more cost competitive, and ultimately drive micro-CHP sales in the UK. Of the 24 million households in the UK, as many as 14 to 18 million are thought to be suitable for micro-CHP units.\nTwo fuel cell varieties of mCHP co-generation units are almost ready for mainstream production and are planned for release to commercial markets in early in 2014. With the UK Government's Feed-In-Tariff available for a 10-year period, a wide uptake of the technology is anticipated.\n\n\n\nThe Danish mCHP project 2007 to 2014 with 30 units is on the island of Lolland and in the western town Varde. Denmark is currently part of the Ene.field project.\n\nThe micro-CHP subsidy was ended in 2012. To test the effects of mCHP on a smart grid, 45 natural gas SOFC units (each 1,5 kWh) from Republiq Power (Ceramic Fuel Cells) will be placed on Ameland in 2013 to function as a virtual power plant.\n\nThe federal government is offering a 10% tax credit for smaller CHP and micro-CHP commercial applications.\n\nIn 2007, the United States company \"Climate Energy\" of Massachusetts introduced the \"Freewatt, a micro-CHP system based on a Honda MCHP engine bundled with a gas furnace (for warm air systems) or boiler (for hydronic or forced hot water heating systems).\n\nThe Freewatt is no longer commercially available (since at least 2014). Through testing it was found to operate at 23.4% efficiency for electrical and 51% efficiency for waste heat recovery.\n\nMarathon Engine Systems, a Wisconsin company, produces a variable electrical and thermal output micro-CHP system called the ecopower with an electrical output of 2.2-4.7 kWe. The ecopower was independently measured to operate at 24.4% and 70.1% electrical and waste heat recovery efficiency, respectively.\n\n\nThrough a pilot program scheduled for mid-2009 in the Canadian province of Ontario, the Freewatt system is being offered by home builder Eden Oak with support from ECR International, Enbridge Gas Distribution and National Grid.\n\nTesting is underway in Ameland, the Netherlands for a three-year field testing until 2010 of HCNG where 20% hydrogen is added to the local CNG distribution net, the appliances involved are kitchen stoves, condensing boilers, and micro-CHP boilers.\n\nMicro-CHP Accelerator, a field trial performed between 2005 and 2008, studied the performance of 87 Stirling engine and internal combustion engine devices in residential houses in the UK. This study found that the devices resulted in average carbon savings of 9% for houses with heat demand over 54 GJ/year.\n\nAn ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) paper fully describes the performance and operating\nexperience with two residential sized Combined Heat and Power units which were in operation from 1979\nthrough 1995.\n\nOregon State University, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy (ARPA-e), tested the state of the art micro-CHP systems in the United States. The results showed that the nominally 1 kWe state-of-the-art micro-CHP system operated at an electrical and total efficiency (LHV based) of 23.4 and 74.4%, respectively. The nominally 5 kWe state-of-the-art system operated at an electrical and total efficiency (LHV based) of 24.4 and 94.5%, respectively. The most popular 7 kWe home backup generator (not CHP) operated at an electrical efficiency (LHV based) of 21.5%. The price of the emergency backup generator was an order of magnitude lower than the 5 kWe generator, but the projected life span of the system was over 2 orders of magnitude lower. These results show the trade-off between efficiency, cost, and durability.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Project Agency - Energy (ARPA-e) has funded $25 million towards mCHP research in the GENerators for Small Electrical and Thermal Systems (GENSETS) program. 12 project teams have been selected to develop a 1 kWe mCHP technology that can achieve 40% electrical efficiency, have a 10-year system life, and cost under $3000.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2019952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019952", "title": "Codicote", "text": "Codicote\n\nCodicote is a large village, and civil parish about seven miles (11 km) south of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, England. It has timber-framed and chequered brick houses, of special interest being the 18th-century Pond House and the half-timbered \"As You Like It\" Peking restaurant (formerly the George and Dragon Inn). Codicote Lodge is 18th-century and Codicote Bury 17th-century. Codicote Parish Council maintain a website for the services, businesses and amenities of the village at www.codicoteparish.net The church, mostly rebuilt in 1853, retains 13th-century work in its nave and aisles. A most unusual structure north of the village is the Node Dairy and Stud, erected in 1927. It is circular in design, and thatched, with a circular courtyard and a tower which is, in fact, a silo.\n\nCodicote lies on a chalk ridge on the dip slope of the Chiltern Hills. The highest parts of the parish lie in the north and east, most of which is over and at one point is reached. The Mimram Valley is between about 220 and in the parish. On the west side of the river the land rises to about at Abbotshay.\n\nA major survey of the landscape in the parish was started in 2007.\n\nThe first Anglo-Saxon settlements in England were created by the invaders themselves. Later individuals or small groups tended to leave these villages to found other secondary settlements in between. The element '-cote' in the name Codicote is typical of this second phase and so it is likely that this village was founded in the later period of colonisation. Thus at some time, perhaps around 600 AD, a man with a name something like Cudda came to the area and founded a settlement. The earliest form of the name is recorded in 1002 as \"Cuthingcoton\", meaning the \"cottages of Cuthhere's people\". A later alternative form of the name was \"Cudingacotu\" in which the first element is \"Cuda\" a diminutive of Cuthhere.\n\nIn the year 1002 Codicote enters the written records for the first time when King Æthelred the Unready, its owner, sold it by means of a charter for the sum of 150 mancusae, or 900 shillings of pure gold to his 'faithful minster' Ælfhelm. It was described as being 'five measures of ground' (of uncertain extent) and known as 'Æt Cuthingcoton'. Shortly after this it passed to the Abbot and Chapter of St Albans Abbey.\n\nBy 1086, the Domesday Book shows its value at six pounds. There was a total of eight 'hides' in the manor, perhaps , of which the Abbot's bailiff farmed three and a quarter hides as the Abbot's 'home farm'. The rest was shared between a number of tenants, 16 'villeins', three humbler cottagers and one 'Frenchman' who may have been the bailiff. In addition there were four (landless) serfs. This suggests a total population of about 100 persons including women and children. There were two profitable mills (now known as Codicote Mill and Fulling Mill), some meadow and pasture and some woodland.\n\nThe church, with its chapel of the Holy Innocents, was dedicated by Ralph, Bishop of Rochester at some time during his period of office, 1108–1115.\n\nCodicote Church of England Primary School dates back to 1857 and the current school, on Meadow Way, was built in 1972.\n\nState secondary education is provided by schools in nearby towns and the vast majority of pupils move on to Hitchin Boys' School, Hitchin Girls' School and Monk's Walk School. Private and other schools are also well catered for in nearby towns. Herts Direct \"Moving On\" Outturn Report on the Initial Analysis of Secondary School Allocations report published in 2009 reveals that 86% of Codicote Primary School pupils selecting schools for the 2009/10 academic year were allocated their first choice secondary school.\n\nPublic houses in Codicote include The Goat, The Globe, and The Bell Motel which has a number of rooms behind the main building. There is also the Sports and Social Club off Bury Lane.\n\nOne of the most significant developments in the village of Codicote in recent decades is the ongoing development of enhanced sports facilities. The current sports field and facilities came about as a result of the death in 1976 of John Clements, a local teacher who died rescuing 35 children by leading them from a burning hotel. He was subsequently awarded the George Cross and a memorial trust fund was quickly established in his honour which led to the current sports field and a changing facility being opened in 1984 and an extension to changing facilities being added in 2000.\n\nThere are currently three main outdoor sports areas and activities in the village:\n\n\nFull planning permission was granted on 30 April 2009 for a new £1.7m Sports Hall. The structure will measure 48.1 meters by 19.3 meters and will include a sports hall, function room, youth club and changing facilities. The new John Clements Sports & Community Centre is targeted to complete by the end of 2011. This enhancement will build on the village's sporting success story by introducing indoor sports such as 5-a-side football, indoor tennis, cricket nets, bowls, basketball and netball. This will provide increased sport for more people in the area and will be a fitting tribute to the memory of John Clements. Further information on this Village development is available at the John Clements Sports & Community Centre website .\n\nNon-League football club Codicote F.C. are one of the senior teams that use the John Clements Memorial Ground.\n\nThere are numerous other Sports & Recreation clubs in Codicote. A full listing of these and other activities in and around Codicote, visit the official Codicote Parish website at .\n\nCodicote Tennis Club has three floodlit hard courts and is based at Codicote Sports & Social Centre in Hertfordshire.\n\nCodicote Village Day (www.codicotevillageday.co.uk) is an annual one-day festival which begins with a parade up the High St and proceeds to the Sports and Recreation field where a program of events, lots of stalls and attractions keep locals and visitors entertained throughout the afternoon. Village Day in 2010 will be held on Saturday 17 July.\n\n\nCodicote Local History Society (www.codicotehistory.org.uk) is dedicated to researching and disseminating knowledge about Codicote's history. Active for over 30 years, the society is running a wide-ranging series of public events and a few archaeological digs in 2018–19.\n\nA 2008 BBC programme , presented by Michael Wood, focused upon the life and times of Christina Cok (died 1348) in Codicote, studying the archives relating to her father's acquisition of field strips and marketplace property, which she took over in the 14th century. She won a consistory court case over her claim to the rights to her land.\n"}

It is the home of Club Puebla. It is currently the fourth-biggest football stadium in Mexico by capacity. The stadium has been the host of the 1970 FIFA World Cup and the 1986 FIFA World Cup. From November 2014–2015, the stadium went through massive renovations.\n\nAs of November 2015, Cuauhtémoc Stadium is considered to be an innovation in textile design and sports architecture in Mexico, since it is the first and only stadium in Latin America to have a facade totally covered with ETFE.\n\nEstadio Cuauhtémoc has been the home for Puebla F.C. for the last 40 years and has witnessed various national and international tournaments the stadium has located in Puebla, Puebla Mexico.\n\nThe Stadium was originally designed in 1965 by architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, who also designed El Estadio Azteca and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nIt was inaugurated on October 6, 1968 during the pre-inauguration of the 1968 Summer Olympics. It is named after the Mexican brewery Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma, who paid for most of the construction.\n\nIn its first years of existence the club had a capacity of 35,000, which was expanded in 1986 for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. A mural that had been painted by Jesús Corro Ferrer, which represented the human race, had to be covered up. The stadium has an official capacity for 42,648, though on some occasions it has had attendance of above 50,000 . The Stadium is the 4th largest, as well as the tallest, stadium in Mexico, behind the Estadio Jalisco in Jalisco.\n\nThe stadium has hosted 2 Mexican Primera División finals. The first came in the 1982-83 tournament when Puebla F.C. defeated C.D. Guadalajara\n\nThe second final was played in the 1989-90 tournament against Club Universidad de Guadalajara where Puebla managed to beat the club from Jalisco 4-3. The stadium has also hosted the now defunct Copa México tournament, which the club managed to win in 1990, becoming just the 5th stadium to host both finals and have its home team win.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted club international tournaments, such as the CONCACAF Champions League and Copa Interamericana. In 2008 the stadium was supposed to host its first Copa Sudamericana tournament, but did not after the CONCACAF decided to pull out of all CONMEBOL competitions due to the clubs' lack of interest in the domestic conference tournaments.\n\nEstadio Cuauhtémoc played host to the Uruguay national football team for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. In the first game on June 2, 1970 Uruguay defeated Israel 2-0. The second match was against Italy, which ended in a scoreless draw. The third match was against Sweden, where Uruguay fell 1-0. Players such as Sandro Mazzola and Luigi Riva went on to play in the finals against Brazil, which they lost to 4-1.\n\nIn 1986 Mexico hosted the 13th World Cup, becoming the first country to ever host the competition for a second time. This occurred due to Colombia announcing in 1983 that they were not going to be available to organize the tournament.\n\nIn this World Cup, Puebla played a bigger role than the previous one in 1970. This time, the defending champions Italy played at El Estadio Cuauhtémoc. Italy played against Argentina on July 5, 1986, where they tied 1–1 with a goal from the football legend Diego Armando Maradona.\nThe second game was against the Korea Republic national football team, who Italy managed to defeat 3–2.\n\nIn the round of 16 match, Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in El Estadio Cuauhtémoc, which was played on June 5, 1986. In the Quarter Finals, the stadium hosted the match between Spain and Belgium which ended in a 1–1 draw, sending them to extra time, and ultimately to a penalty shootout. Van der Elst would score the final and deciding goal, sending Belgium to the semi finals. In that match, the stadium registered the biggest crowd with an attendance of 45,000.\n\nIn 2012 the state of Puebla was named to host the 2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship.\n\nPuebla FC announced a complete renovation of the stadium that was set to begin in the late 2014. The stadium was old, in bad condition, and needed a fresh new image. In early 2014, the Governor of Puebla, Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas announced the official project.\n\nThe stadium would grow in capacity from 42,648 to 51,726 spectators, and would be completely remodeled from the inside, with 2 new ramps built in the north and south side of the stadium, along many other things.\n\nInitially the facade of the stadium would be covered with crystal. \n\nDünn Lightweight Architecture, experts in sports and textile architecture in Mexico and Latin America, made a new proposal with ETFE because of the many advantages that ETFE had over other materials for that particular project. ETFE has been used in many world renowned architectural works, such as the Water Cube for the Olympics in Beijing, and by many European stadiums such as the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nRenovations started in November 2014 and were initially planned to be done by October 2015. Due to the city's rainy season, construction slowed down and in August 2015 it was announced that the construction would be done by November 2015. As of November 2015, the Cuauhtémoc stadium would be the first and only stadium in Mexico and Latin America to have a facade completely covered with ETFE. On November 18 the stadium was reopened in a friendly match against Boca Juniors of Argentina before Puebla's final week of Liga MX Apertura 2015.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2019967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019967", "title": "Kanbun Uechi", "text": "Kanbun Uechi\n\nKanbun was born in Deikusaku section but grew up in the Takintō section of the mountain farming village of Izumi on the Motobu Peninsula of Okinawa, Uechi's family were farmers of daikon radishes. While it is claimed that in his youth, Uechi studied bōjutsu and basic Chinese techniques with Motobu experts, some of whom had lived in China, a more recent Okinawan government sanctioned publication notes that there exists no record of him learning \"any kind of martial art\" prior to his move to China.\n\nJapan began a program of universal male conscription in Okinawa in 1897. In 1897 at the age of 19, Kanbun fled to Fuzhou in Fukien Province, China both to escape Japanese military conscription and to fulfill his dreams of studying martial arts with Chinese masters. Kanbun later told students he was the only survivor of his small \"dugout\" row boat trip to China, and he was rescued by a Chinese martial artist who eventually introduced him to another Chinese martial artist. Upon arrival in Fuzhou, Uechi took residence in the Okinawan boarding house Ryukyu Jyuentaku Hall. He initially took up the study of Kojo Ryū under two Okinawan men named Kugusuku and Matsuda, but the latter mocked him for a speech impediment, and the offended Uechi sought training elsewhere.\n\nUechi next took up the study of herbalism and a Kung Fu system he identified as \"Pangai-noon\" (or Pangainun), under a Chinese master of Tiger and Crane styles of southern Kung Fu named Zhou Zihe (Called \"Shushiwa\" in Japanese and \"Shushabu\" by Kanbun). A great deal of unsourced apocryphal stories exist on how Kanbun met and came to train with Zhou Zihe, and more recent research in the region with assistance of the Fuzhou Wushu Association does not provide a detailed answer. However, the Wushu Association accepts that Zhou Zihe taught foreign students and Kanbun trained with him for 13 years, mastered the three \"kata\" Sanchin, Seisan, and Sanseirui, as well as learned \"kote kitae\" (小手鍛え), or \"forearm tempering.\" Review of current Uechi-Ryū practice with several styles in Fuzhou linked to Zhou Zihe, which all developed on their own subsequently, led the Wushu Association to suggest that Kanbun made his own modifications to make what he would call \"Pangai-noon\".\n\nKanbun received a teaching license from Zhou Zihe in 1904 and in 1906 he opened his own dōjō in Nanjing. He continued periodic training under Zhou Zihe during the next three years for a total of 13 years. After the three years, Kanbun Uechi returned to Okinawa, determined never to teach again because reportedly one of his Chinese students had killed a neighbor with an open-hand technique in a dispute over land irrigation.\n\nUechi returned to Naha, Okinawa in 1909, and he refused to teach martial arts while in Okinawa. He soon married, and his first son, Kanei Uechi was born in 1911. In 1912, a tea merchant and White Crane Kung Fu master Go Kenki (Wú Xiánguì) who knew him settled in Okinawa. As word spread from Go Kenki that Kanbun Uechi was a skilled martial arts teacher, he received requests to teach but refused.\n\nDue the economic situation in Okinawa, in 1924, at the age of 47, Kanbun Uechi left for Wakayama City, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan to find employment. While he was working as a security guard for a local Showa Spinning cotton spinning mill, he was persuaded by a co-worker, Ryuyu Tomoyose, to teach him privately after having been first convinced to show him ways of defending himself against different attacks. In 1926, after two years of private lessons, Ryuyu Tomoyose gathered together other interested potential students for a total of 30 men who all agreed to pay 5 \"yen\" each month. Since his month salary was only 15 \"yen\" each month, Kanbun Uechi agreed to resume teaching. Until 1932, he taught in small rooms in the company dormitory before work, during lunchtime, and after work He then opened a general store and the \"Pangai-noon Karate Academy\" open to the general public in Tebira, Wakayama Prefecture .\n\nIn 1934, Kanbun Uechi met Kenwa Mabuni, the founder of Shitō-ryū, who interviewed Uechi in an article \"The Story of Chinese Kenpo\" he published in the 1934 edition of \"Karate Research\". Mabuni suggested that Kanbun change the name of his style to \"Uechi-Ryū\" (上地流) or \"style of Uechi.\" The style he taught was renamed in 1940 to \"Uechi-Ryū\" Karate in his honor, and is one of the four major styles of Okinawan Karate.\n\nKanbun Uechi continued to teach in Wakayama until 1946., In November of that year, Kanbun Uechi turned over his school to Ryuyu Tomoyose and returned to Okinawa and settled on the island of Iejima. Students which included Ryuyu Tomoyose's son, Ryuko, built a \"dōjō\" named the Uechi-Ryū Karate Academy. Kanbun Uechi passed away from kidney disease in 1948.\n\nAfter Kanbun Uechi's death, his style was systematized by his son Kanei and his senior students. This included the addition of a number of \"bridging\" \"kata\" between the three Kanbun Uechi brought back from Fuzhou. Uechi-Ryū has students and \"dōjōs\" around the world, and it is particularly popular in the Northeastern United States.\n\nKanbun Uechi had four children. His oldest son, Kanei, continued his father's work in the martial arts. He had another son, Kansai, and two daughters, Tsuru (named after her grandmother) and Kamai.\n\n"}

She was a Country Liberal Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2000 to 2005, representing the central Darwin electorate of Port Darwin. After winning a by-election upon the resignation of former Chief Minister Shane Stone, Carter served as Opposition Whip and Shadow Minister for Health, and was briefly touted as a leadership aspirant before being unexpectedly defeated at the 2005 election.\n\nCarter spent her childhood living in a number of locations across Australia, due to her father's position in the Royal Australian Air Force. She studied nursing, and subsequently moved to Darwin in 1979, gaining a position at the hospital there. She studied teaching at the Northern Territory University some years later, and went on to work as an adult educator, teaching in health-related areas in both Darwin and Katherine. Carter later served as Convenor of the Northern Territory Women's Advisory Council to the Chief Minister, Marshall Perron from 1993 to 1995, before going on to work as an investigator for the Health and Community Services Complaints Commission.\n\nIn February 2000, former Chief Minister Shane Stone resigned from parliament, causing a by-election in his safe CLP seat of Port Darwin. Carter won preselection to contest the seat for the CLP. Although the by-election came at a bad time for the CLP government, Carter easily retained the seat in a quiet campaign where Stone's mandatory sentencing policies were the major issue. She was appointed Deputy Chairman of Committees upon entering parliament, which saw her serve in the Speaker's absence.\n\nCarter was re-elected at the 2001 election, though she suffered a 10-point swing. She not only had to fend off a Labor challenger, but former CLP stalwart and former territory minister Nick Dondas, who ran as an independent. Labor narrowly won government at this election due in part to significant gains in Darwin; Carter was the only CLP member west of Palmerston, and the only CLP member in the capital. She was promoted to Opposition Whip upon her re-election, and was again promoted in December 2002, when she was appointed Shadow Minister for Health, Senior Territorians, Arts, and Museums. This left her handling the opposition's response in one of the most difficult portfolios in the Northern Territory, with health being a serious and ongoing issue for the territory government.\n\nCarter supported Terry Mills in both his unsuccessful challenge to Opposition Leader Denis Burke in June 2003, and his successful challenge that November. However, in October 2004 she was demoted, with Mills assigning her health portfolio to Jodeen Carney. She was regarded as an outside chance for the CLP leadership when Mills resigned in February 2005, but she allowed Burke to regain the leadership uncontested.\n\nCarter was widely expected to win a third term in office at the 2005 election. However, an unexpectedly large victory by the Labor government saw an extremely close result in Port Darwin. The result was not known for several days. Ultimately, Labor candidate Kerry Sacilotto emerged the victor by 73 votes to become the first Labor member to win Port Darwin. Sacilotto actually won enough primary votes to defeat Carter without the need for preferences.\n\nIn 2008 Carter returned to her home town of the Gold Coast, after nearly 30 years in the NT, where she now works as a registered nurse.\n"}

Forty were built between October 1933 and March 1934.\n\nAlthough all built at Crewe Works, they were designed at Horwich Works and were developed from the Horwich Mogul, the LMS Hughes \"Crab\" 2-6-0. They had the addition of several features brought over from the Great Western Railway by newly arrived Chief Mechanical Engineer William Stanier, most notably the taper boiler. (Stanier would have been familiar with the GWR 4300 Class). In an effort to please Stanier, Horwich had designed in \na GWR style top-feed cover and locomotive 13245 appeared with the feature fitted. Stanier was not at all pleased, ordering it promptly removed and replaced with the normal LMS cover.\n\nDue to a higher boiler pressure than the \"Crabs\" the cylinders were 3\" smaller in diameter and so the cylinders were able to be mounted horizontally: the only Stanier design to do so. Like the \"Crabs\" they were connected to a Fowler tender that was narrower than the locomotive. When built the first ten locomotives had no water pick-up gear fitted to their tenders.\n\nThey were initially numbered 13245–13284 (following on from the \"Crabs\"), but as standard locomotives, in the LMS 1933 renumbering scheme they were renumbered 2945–2984 in 1934 (the \"Crabs\" becoming 2700–2944). BR added 40000 to their numbers so they became 42945–42984. They were always painted black, and this was lined out except during the austere periods of the 1940s and towards the end of steam.\n\nFrom the end of 1934 Stanier turned to a larger 4-6-0 for his mixed traffic class, this being the LMS Black Five Class.\n\nWithdrawals commenced in November 1963 with the last one being withdrawn in February 1967.\n\nOne, 13268/(4)2968, the penultimate member of the class to be withdrawn, has been preserved. This locomotive was restored on the Severn Valley Railway and is, as of 2017, undergoing overhaul after withdrawal from service in January 2013. On two occasions, firstly between late 1994 and early 1998, and then between May 2010 and March 2012, it ran with the tender from LMS Black 5 no. 45110, while its own Fowler-pattern one was undergoing repairs.\n\nBachmann Branchline has produced a model of the Stanier Mogul including the preserved example. \n\nInitial releases from Bachmann Branchline include the LMS Black Lined version 31-690 in February 2017, BR Black early emblem and BR Black late emblem.

Situated on a tableland, a spur of the Chilterns, Whitwell is about 400 feet above sea level. The soil is mostly clay with flints.\n\nIt contains a number of early brick and half-timbered houses, several of which are of the 18th century. Waterhall Farm (an open farm and craft centre) is one of the village's attractions. Whitwell was once known for its ‘notorious seven’ public houses, but today only one remains; The Bull Inn. The most recent to close was The Maiden's Head in 2015, which is currently due for auction. With the River Mimram running north-west to south-east through Whitwell, the village has been noted (apparently since Roman times) for its production of prime watercress.\n\nRoman coins have been found in Whitwell.\n\nIn 2019, construction began on a new housing development named The Heath, located on Bendish Lane. It is estimated to be opened in Spring 2020.\n\nWhitwell also has a thriving amateur dramatics society - The Whitwell Players. As far as it is possible to tell, there has been some form of am dram society in Whitwell for over a century, but The Whitwell Players, in its current guise, came into being in the 1980s. The players perform at least two or three times a year in Spring, Autumn and a Panto in December. As a result of their labours, many people have benefitted as the Players make donations to support local charities on a regular basis.\n\nHighlights include: the company's first Shakespearean production - A Midsummer Night's dream - in 2002, performed both in the village hall and in the open air at the stunning St. Paul's walden Bury gardens, as well as Much Ado About Nothing, Hobson's Choice, Allo, Allo, Blackadder, Calendar Girls, See How They Run...more on the website.\n"}

He played as a goalkeeper for, among others, RCD Espanyol, FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. As an international he played for both the Catalan XI and Spain. As a manager, he won two La Liga titles with Atlético Aviación and briefly managed Spain.\n\nZamora, nicknamed \"El Divino\", was noted for wearing a cloth cap and a white polo-neck jumper on the field, a look later copied by several of his contemporaries. He claimed it was to protect him from both the sun and his opponents. As a goalkeeper, he was primarily known for his athleticism, quick reflexes, shot-stopping abilities, large frame, and bravery in goal. In 1929 while playing for Spain against England, he carried on playing despite breaking his sternum. Spain won the game 4–3, becoming the first team from outside the British Isles to defeat England. Zamora is also remembered for a spectacular last minute save he made in the 1936 Copa del Presidente de la República Final while playing for Real Madrid against FC Barcelona. Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, along with Gianpiero Combi and František Plánička, as well as one of the greatest of all time, in 1999, the IFFHS elected him the best Spanish goalkeeper – as well as the fourth best in Europe and fifth best overall – of the twentieth century; in the same year, he was voted one of the greatest players of the 20th century by \"World Soccer\" magazine. The award for the best goalkeeper in La Liga, the Ricardo Zamora Trophy, is named in his honour. Zamora was also Spain's most capped player for 45 years until being surpassed by José Ángel Iribar.\n\nZamora was also the subject of controversy throughout his career. He allegedly enjoyed drinking Cognac and smoking up to three packs of cigarettes a day. During the 1920 Olympic Games he was sent off against Italy after punching an opponent and on the way back from the same tournament he was arrested, imprisoned and fined for attempting to smuggle Havana cigars. In 1922 he was suspended for a year when he lied to the tax authorities about the signing on fee he received when he returned to RCD Espanyol. He also received 40,000 pesetas of the 150,000 peseta fee that took him from Espanyol to Real Madrid.\n\nZamora's ostensible political allegiances were also the subject of debate and controversy. Despite playing regularly for the Catalan XI, he was accused of rejecting Catalan nationalism. In 1934, he was awarded an Order of the Republic medal by his namesake Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, president of the Second Spanish Republic, while during the Spanish Civil War he was exploited by Nationalist propagandists and he played in a benefit game for their cause. During the 1950s he was awarded the Great Cross of the Order of Cisneros by the Franco regime.\n\nHe died in 1978 and is interred in the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Zamora began his career as a junior with Universitari SC before signing for Espanyol in 1916. He helped Espanyol win the Campionat de Catalunya in 1918 before an argument with one of the club's directors saw him being transferred to local rivals FC Barcelona in 1919. After three successful seasons at Barça he returned to Espanyol in 1922. On 2 February 1929, he made his La Liga debut with Espanyol during the competitions inaugural season. In the same year he also helped the club win both the Campionat de Catalunya and their first ever Copa del Rey in 1929. The team was coached by Jack Greenwell and also included Ricardo Saprissa. In the quarter finals of the Copa del Rey they beat Atlético Madrid 9–3 on aggregate before beating eventual La Liga champions, Barcelona, 3–1 in the semi-finals and Real Madrid 2–1 in the final. After playing 26 La Liga games for Espanyol, he joined Real Madrid in 1930.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1922 Zamora was a prominent member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that also included his close friend Josep Samitier, Sagibarba, Paulino Alcántara and Félix Sesúmaga. During his time at Barcelona he helped the team win the Campionat de Catalunya three times and the Copa del Rey twice.\n\nIn 1930 Zamora signed for Real Madrid. He was one of several new arrivals, and among the others was Jacinto Quincoces. During the 1931–32 season they helped the club win La Liga for the first time. The following season Zamora and Quincoces were joined at the club by Josep Samitier and the trio helped Real retain the title. In 1934 Francisco Bru took over as the Real coach and he guided Zamora and company to victory in two Copa de España finals. In 1934 they beat a Valencia CF team coached by Jack Greenwell 2–1. The 1936 final saw Real Madrid meet FC Barcelona for the first time in a cup final. Despite playing with ten men for most of the game, the Madrid club beat Barça 2–1 at the Mestalla. Barça's attempts to equalise in the final minutes were thwarted by Zamora's spectacular save from Josep Escolà.\n\nIn 1920 together with Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga, Pichichi and José María Belauste, Zamora was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games. Zamora subsequently made 46 official appearances for Spain and also represented them at the 1934 World Cup.\n\nZamora also played at least 13 games for the Catalan XI. However records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played more. Together with Paulino Alcántara, Sagibarba and Josep Samitier he helped the Catalan XI win an inter-regional competition, the \"Copa Princep de Asturies\", three times during the 1920s.\n\nIn July 1936 during the early days of the Spanish Civil War, \"ABC\" falsely reported that Zamora had been killed by Republicans. The Nationalists then attempted to exploit this as propaganda. However, Zamora was alive and well and, as rumours began to spread of his death, he was arrested by Republican militia and then imprisoned at the Modelo prison. Among his fellow prisoners were Ramón Serrano Súñer and Rafael Sánchez Mazas. His life was saved by both the actions of the prison governor Melchor Rodríguez García and because of his own willingness to play and talk football with the guards. Zamora was eventually released after the Argentinian Embassy interceded on his behalf. He then made his way to France where he was reunited with Josep Samitier at OGC Nice. He later returned to Spain and on 8 December 1938 played for a Spain XI against Real Sociedad in a benefit game for Nationalist soldiers.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Franco regime awarded Zamora the Great Cross of the Order of Cisneros, a medal created in 1944 to reward \"political merit.\"\n\nIn 1939 Zamora was appointed coach of Atlético Madrid, then known as Athletic Aviación and later to become Atlético Aviación, following a merger with \"Aviación Nacional\", a Spanish Air Force team. With Zamora as manager, the club won their first La Liga in 1940 and then retained the title in 1941. In 1946 he moved to Celta de Vigo and during the 1947–48, he led a Celta team that included Pahiño and Miguel Muñoz to fourth in La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo final. In June 1952 he coached Spain for two games. He later returned to Celta de Vigo and then had two spells as coach at Espanyol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2019987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019987", "title": "115th Infantry Regiment (United States)", "text": "115th Infantry Regiment (United States)\n\nThe 115th Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard was an infantry regiment of the United States Army. It traced its roots back to the American Revolutionary War, although its official U.S. Army lineage begins in 1881. The units to which the 115th Regiment claims lineage served in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, but the 115th itself was only credited with service in World War I, World War II, and the Global War on Terror. Prior to the reorganization into the 58th Brigade Combat Team, the 1–115th was part of the Third Brigade, 29th Infantry Division (Light). In 2006, the 115th was consolidated (merged) with the 175th Infantry Regiment. As a result of this consolidation, it no longer exists as a separate regiment.\n\nThe 1–115th IN had two major missions:\n\nThe Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1–115 Infantry, was located in Silver Spring, Maryland. While the rifle companies made up the bulk of the personnel and combat power of the battalion, the headquarters company was made up of specialties that extend and expand the capabilities of the battalion. It leads, supports, sustains, and protects.\n\nIncluded in the headquarters company were:\n\n\nAlpha Company, 1–115 Infantry, located in Frederick, Maryland, was an Infantry Rifle Company.\n\nIncluded in the company were:\n\n\nBravo Company, 1–115 Infantry, located in Olney, Maryland, was an Infantry Rifle Company.\n\nIncluded in the company were:\n\n\nCharlie Company, 1–115 Infantry, located in Greenbelt, Maryland, was an Infantry Rifle Company.\n\nIncluded in the company were:\n\n\nThe Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2–115 Infantry, was located in Chestertown, Maryland. While the rifle companies made up the bulk of the personnel and combat power of the battalion, the headquarters company was made up of specialties that extend and expand the capabilities of the battalion. It leads, supports, sustains, and protects.\n\nIncluded in the headquarters company were:\n\n\nAlpha Company, 2–115 Infantry, located in Glen Burnie, Maryland, was an Infantry Rifle Company.\n\nIncluded in the company were:\n\n\nBravo Company, 2–115 Infantry, located in Queen Anne, Maryland, was an Infantry Rifle Company.\n\nIncluded in the company were:\n\n\nCharlie Company, 2–115 Infantry, located in Catonsville, Maryland, was an Infantry Rifle Company.\n\nIncluded in the company were:\n\n\nThe 115th Infantry has long claimed lineage and honors that have not been recognized by the U.S. Army Center of Military history. The unit's official lineage and honors certificate only recognizes lineage extending back to 1881, while the regiment has traditionally held that it was descended from Cresap's Rifles, a company of infantry raised in 1775. The mismatch stems from a lineage system unique in the U.S. armed forces to the Army National Guard, which requires continuous militia presence in a particular community or, if a unit is moved, proof that the same members served in the unit at both locations. Because of a lack of support for militia units in the 1870s, many, including the First Maryland (predecessor to the 115th) ceased to exist as organized militia units. Army National Guard lineage rules state that any unit that becomes inactive has its lineage terminated, and that such lineage cannot be \"resurrected,\" even if a unit with identical designation is later established.\n\nThe 115th Infantry claims lineage back to the earliest militia units formed to protect the frontier of western Maryland. The birthdate of the unit, 14 June 1775, is also the birthdate of the United States Army. The first two companies to leave Maryland were assembled in Frederick in the summer of 1775 under the command of Captains Cresap and Price; they were organized in response to the Continental Congress' call to active duty. They left Frederick in August and marched in 21 days to report to General Washington in September to support Washington's efforts to drive the British out of Boston. These personnel later became part of the 1st Maryland Regiment, \"Maryland 400\" or \"Maryland Line,\" who repeatedly charged a numerically superior British force during the Battle of Long Island, sustaining heavy casualties, but allowing General Washington to successfully evacuate the bulk of his troops to Manhattan. This action is commemorated in Maryland's nickname, the \"Old Line State.\"\n\nDuring the Civil War, two First Maryland Infantry (USA) regimental infantry units were organized:\n\nThe 1st Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry (USA), commanded by Colonel John R. Kenly, and the 1st Maryland Infantry (CSA), commanded by Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, constituted the major part of the forces engaged at the Battle of Front Royal on 23 May 1862. During this battle, in which the Confederates were successful, Colonel Kenly gave utterance to the famous command, \"Rally round the Flag,\" which is to this day the motto of the 115th Regiment. This was the only time in United States military history that two regiments of the same numerical designation and from the same state engaged each other in battle. The 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA had been composed primarily of soldiers the Baltimore-based Fifth Regiment.\n\nA direct descendant of this regiment was organized 29 September 1881 as the First Battalion of Infantry, Maryland Army National Guard, from existing independent companies at Hagerstown and Frederick, Maryland. This is the date of organization officially recognized as the start of the regiment's lineage by the U.S. Army. It was expanded and redesignated First Regiment of Infantry on 7 May 1886 by the consolidation of the First Battalion of Infantry with several more independent companies of infantry throughout the state.\n\nThe unit mustered into federal service 11 May 1898 as the First Maryland Infantry Regiment, U.S. Volunteers, and was assigned to the Second Army Corps during the Spanish–American War. The regiment was mustered out of Federal Service 15 March 1899 without serving outside the continental United States. On 28 June 1916 the regiment was again called into active service and saw duty at Eagle Pass, Texas during the Mexican Border Incident. Two of the battalion commanders who served during this period were Majors Milton A. Reckord (future Adjutant General, State of Maryland) and D. John Markey (future regimental commander). The unit was mustered out of federal service on 4 November 1916.\n\nIn October 1917, while at Camp McClellan, Alabama, the First Maryland was consolidated with the Fourth and Fifth Maryland Infantry Regiments to form the 115th Infantry Regiment. The 115th became one of the four regiments brought together into the 29th Infantry Division, which was formed in July 1917, at Sea Girt, New Jersey. The division wasn't even a year old when it received its baptism of fire in France. Company K, 115th, was the first unit in the 29th Division to engage the enemy when it repelled a German raid in July 1918.\n\nDuring the Meuse-Argonne offensive they would fight for 21 straight days, moving over , throwing back elements of six enemy divisions, and suffering a staggering 4,781 casualties in the process. After the Armistice was signed, the Twenty-Ninth Division was brought home in July 1919 and dissipated. The 1st Battalion, 115th Infantry, is authorized two campaign streamers for its service in World War I: one for Alsace and one for Meuse-Argonne. The next time the division would be reformed was for the maneuvers in 1936.\n\nFollowing the First World War, the regiments returned to state status and assumed their previous designations, First Maryland and Fifth Maryland (the Fourth Regiment was not re-established after the war).\n\nOn 3 February 1941, the First Maryland Infantry Regiment, Maryland Army National Guard, was inducted into federal service as the 115th Infantry Regiment at Frederick, Maryland as part of the second partial mobilization of the National Guard for World War II, and then moved to Fort George G. Meade on 18 February 1941 to join the 29th Infantry Division. The regiment completed in-processing, traded in its equipment for modern equipment, and started to repeat its division level training. It was then transferred to the A.P. Hill Military Reservation on 22 April 1942 to participate in maneuvers, and then moved to the Carolina Maneuvers to participate in large unit maneuvers on 8 July 1942. It then moved on to Camp Blanding to fill its empty personnel slots on 19 August 1942, and then staged at Camp Kilmer on 20 September 1942, and shipped out from the New York Port of Embarkation on 5 October 1942 on the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. They arrived in England on 11 October 1942, and then were attached to the 1st Infantry Division in preparation for the D-Day invasion. They moved with the 1st Infantry Division from 2 June 1944, and remained with 1st Infantry Division until 7 June 1944, when they returned to the 29th Infantry Division for further operations. Their participation in the Normandy Campaign continued until it was over on 24 July 1944. They immediately moved into the Northern France Campaign on 25 July 1944, which continued until it was over on 14 September 1944.\n\nDuring this period the 115th Infantry Regiment was engaged in one of the war's forgotten chapters, \"The Battle of Brest\". The Battle for Brest was one of the fiercest battles fought during Operation Cobra, the Allied breakout of Normandy which began on 27 July 1944, during the Battle of Normandy during World War II.\n\nPart of the Allied plan for the invasion of mainland Europe called for the capture of port facilities, in order to ensure the timely delivery of the enormous amount of war material required to supply the invading Allied forces (it was estimated that the 37 Allied divisions to be on the continent by September 1944 would need 26,000 tons of supplies each day). The main port the Allied forces hoped to seize and put into their service was Brest, in northwestern France.\n\nBrest also served as a major German U-Boat base from 18 June 1940 until its surrender to U.S. forces during the Brittany Campaign.\n\n\"Officers from the 115th Regimental Combat Team of the 29th Infantry Division (Photo Taken September 1944). From Left to Right; Lt Col John P.

With the end of the Rhineland Campaign, the 115th Infantry moved to the Central Europe Campaign on 22 March 1945, which continued until the end of Hostilities, which took place on 8 May 1945, but the campaign was not declared terminated until 11 May 1945.\n\nThe 115th Infantry was on occupation duty at Bremen, Germany on VE Day, and this continued through 1946. The regiment returned to the New York Port of Embarkation on 16 January 1946, and mustered out at Camp Kilmer the next day.\n\nThe 115th Regiment sustained 5,948 casualties during the fighting in Europe. Campaign streamers for Normandy (with arrowhead), North France, Rhineland, and Central Europe were added to the colors. Additional decorations included a distinguished unit streamer embroidered \"St. Laurent-Sur-Mer,\" a streamer in the colors of the French Croix du Guerre with palms embroidered \"St. Laurent-Sur-Mer,\" and, for the First Battalion, a streamer in the colors of the French Croix du Guerre with Silver Star embroidered \"St. Lo.\"\n\nAfter the war the 29th Infantry Division came home; however, unlike the end of World War I, the division was retained as a National Guard division. In 1968, due to changing requirements, the division's colors were retired and its elements broken up into separate brigades. The 115th became part of the 28th Division, the Keystone Division of Pennsylvania. Later the 1–115th and other Maryland units were organized into the 58th Infantry Brigade, whose units were located entirely in Maryland.\n\nIn 1984 requirements changed again, prompting the reactivation of the 29th Infantry Division as a new, streamlined \"Light\" Infantry Division, ready to meet the demands of an ever-changing national defense, now and into the 21st century. The division was reactivated on 5 Oct 1985, and included the 115th and other historic regiments from Maryland and Virginia. As part of this reactivation, the 58th Infantry Brigade became the 3rd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division. Elements of the brigade included the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 115th Infantry.\n\nIn October 2001, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks on the continental United States, the battalions of the 115th were called to active federal service as part of Operation Noble Eagle. The 115th carried out critical security duties, protecting US federal installations from threats to the national security.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, Company B, 1–115th Infantry, mobilized again for active duty as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were assigned as part of the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), based in Georgia, for this operation. They spent a year in Iraq. For the first 5 months they conducted operations in a town called Saba Al boor north of Baghdad that had a population of between 50,000 and 65,000. Saba Al Boor's population was half Sunni and Shia. B Co 1/115th was the main effort for Task Force 2/70th Armor which is an active duty unit from Ft. Riley, Kansas. B Co conducted raids, counter IED ambushes, air assaults, cordon and searches as well as combined patrols with the Iraqi Army. For the remaining 7 months they performed convoy security operations out of the Marine base at Al Asad. These convoy security missions included missions to country of Jordan, the Iraqi towns of Rawa, Hit, and al Taqaddum. During B Co's time conducting convoy security operations they were able to reduce the rate of losses from 11% of escorted equipment and supplies that was suffered by the unit previously conducting the mission to less than 2%.\n\nIn the beginning of 2006, the elements of the 115th were reorganized, along with the rest of the 3rd Brigade, 29th Infantry Division, as part of the 58th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. In August 2006 the colors for the 115th Infantry Regiment were cased and its lineage consolidated (merged) with that of the 175th Infantry Regiment (Fifth Maryland).\n\nSince 2003 the heritage of the regiment lives on along Route 15 through Maryland, where the Maryland Senate dedicated it as the 115th Infantry Regiment Memorial Highway.\n\n"}
{"id": "2019991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019991", "title": "Horace (video game series)", "text": "Horace (video game series)\n\nThe Horace video game series was created in the 1980s by William Tang for Beam Software. The series comprised \"Hungry Horace\", \"Horace Goes Skiing\" and \"Horace and the Spiders\".\n\n\"Hungry Horace\" and \"Horace and the Spiders\" were two of the few ZX Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2.\n\nThe original Horace game, \"Hungry Horace\" was written as a simple \"Pac-Man\" clone, published in 1982. In it, Horace must gather food from around a park and move onto the next section while avoiding park guards. It is possible for him to collect a bell to panic the guards and render them vulnerable, like the power pills in \"Pac-Man\". This title was available on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Dragon 32. The ZX Spectrum original was marketed and distributed by Sinclair themselves, the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions by Melbourne House.\n\nThe Commodore 64 version also included a level editor which allowed the game owner to create, edit and save to cassette tape their own levels of the game. These could be shared with other owners of the game.\n\nA DOS-hosted level editor was written for the ZX Spectrum version in 2009.\n\nIn 1982 Tang also produced \"Horace Goes Skiing\", in which Horace must cross a dangerous road teeming with traffic, à la \"Frogger\", to rent out a pair of skis, then get back over the road and successfully navigate a ski course.\n\nThis title is not a true sequel, as it does not follow on from an original story and is only similar in that it features the same character. Like \"Hungry Horace\", this title was available on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Dragon 32. As before, Sinclair distributed the Spectrum version, Melbourne House the Commodore 64 and Dragon 32 versions. In 2017, the game placed on \"Eurogamer\"'s \"10 games that defined the ZX Spectrum\" list.\nIn 1983, Tang produced the third title in the series, \"Horace and the Spiders\". This was primarily a platform game with the Horace sprite retained from the first two games. The first level sees Horace climbing a hill while jumping over spiders. The second level involves crossing a bridge by swinging on spider threads. The third level is the final confrontation with the spiders – he must create holes in the web, luring the spiders into the holes to fix them and subsequently jumping on them.\n\nUnlike the earlier two titles, this game was only released for the ZX Spectrum. The first stage of this game shared similarities with both \"Pitfall\" and the Colecovision game \"\", whilst the third platform stage is essentially a \"Space Panic\" clone.\nThis title was announced in 1985 but the game never appeared, due to the author Tang suffering a collapsed lung and being unable to continue.\nHorace made a comeback in 1995 with the platform based game \"Horace in the Mystic Woods\" for the Psion 3-Series of palmtop computers. This fourth entry in the Horace series is a platform game split into one-screen levels in the style of \"Manic Miner\" and was coded by Michael Ware of Proteus Developments. It is Series 3a/3c and 3mx compatible.\n\nIn 2010, a conversion of the game to the ZX Spectrum was released by indie coder Bob Smith.\nIn the Spectrum version of the 1987 game \"Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear\", Gadget has to make his way through several scrolling worlds. In the first of these, he is hindered by Horaces travelling in the opposite direction; if he trips over too many of them, he loses a life.\n\nA reference to Horace is also present in the 2003 PlayStation 2 game \"Dog's Life\", which features a shop named \"Horace's Ski Shop\". The name is written in a font similar to the one used on the ZX Spectrum, and is accompanied by a Spectrum-style rainbow pattern.\n\nA fan made game \"Horace Goes to the Tower\" was released in 2011.\n\n"}

As a student at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s, she became active in organizations working for civil liberties and the civil rights movement. She went on to do voter registration and community organization in Alabama and Mississippi and was an early organizer of the women's liberation movement. She authored several classic feminist articles as well as important papers on social movements and political parties. She has also written extensively about women, particularly on law and public policy toward women and women in mainstream politics.\n\nShe was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1945. Her mother Helen was from Hamilton, Alabama, and had served during World War II as a first lieutenant in the Women's Army Corps, stationed in England. Soon after Jo's birth she moved to Los Angeles, California where she taught junior high school until shortly before her death from emphysema. Freeman attended Birmingham High School, but graduated in the first class of Granada Hills High School in 1961. She received her BA with honors in political science from UC Berkeley in 1965. She began her graduate work in political science at the University of Chicago in 1968 and completed her PhD in 1973. After four years of teaching at the State University of New York she went to Washington, DC as a Brookings Fellow and stayed another year as an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow. She entered New York University School of Law in 1979 as a Root-Tilden Scholar and received her JD degree in 1982. She was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1983.\n\nFreeman moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn in 1979 to attend law school and has lived in Kensington, Brooklyn since 1985.\n\nAt Berkeley, Freeman was active in the University Young Democrats and the campus political party, SLATE. SLATE worked to abolish nuclear testing, to eliminate the University's ban on controversial speakers, and to improve undergraduate education at Cal. It developed a guide to classes and professors entitled the \"SLATE Supplement to the General Catalog,\" for which Freeman wrote reviews of professors and their courses. One of SLATE's fundamental principles was that students should have the same rights to take stands on issues on campus that they had as citizens off campus. The University had restricted such activity since the 1930s. It became a major issue when the civil rights movement came to the Bay Area in the fall of 1963 because students wanted to support the movement on campus as well as off.\n\nIn the fall of 1964 the question was dramatized when student organizations set up tables on campus to solicit money and recruit students for off-campus political action in defiance of the ban. One person was arrested and several students were issued administrative citations. After a mass arrest was narrowly avoided by last minute negotiations with University president Clark Kerr, the Free Speech Movement (FSM) was formed by the student groups to continue the struggle. Freeman represented the University Young Democrats on the FSM executive committee. After two months of fruitless negotiations, Freeman was one of \"the 800\" students who were arrested for sitting in at the main administration building on December 2–3, 1964. This was the biggest mass arrest in California history. The publicity it generated compelled the Regents of the University to change the rules so that students could pursue political issues on campus.\n\nWhen the civil rights movement came to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1963, it picketed local employers who didn't hire blacks. Demonstrations were organized at Lucky supermarket and Mel's Drive-In to get them to sign hiring agreements. Success here was followed by unsuccessful negotiations with San Francisco's most elegant hotels and several automobile dealers. Freeman was one of 167 demonstrators arrested at the Sheraton-Palace Hotel in March 1964, and one of 226 arrested at the Cadillac agency in April. She was acquitted in her first trial and convicted in her second, resulting in a fifteen-day jail sentence. Her second trial kept her from attending the 1964 Freedom Summer project in Mississippi. After it ended she hitchhiked to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in August in Atlantic City, New Jersey to support the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's petition to be seated in place of the all-white regular Mississippi delegation.\n\nFollowing graduation from UC Berkeley, Freeman joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's (SCLC) summer project, SCOPE (Southern Community Organization and Political Education). When the summer was over, she joined the SCLC staff as a field worker. For the next year she did voter registration in Alabama and Mississippi, spending a few days in jail in both states. In August 1966, when she was working in Grenada, Mississippi, the \"Jackson Daily News\" published an exposé of her work as a \"professional agitator\" on its editorial page, implying that she was a communist sympathizer. Accompanied by five photographs, including one taken at Cal during the FSM, this made her a potential target for Mississippi death squads. Thirty years later a federal court order disclosed that these were provided to the newspaper by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission. An informant had documented Freeman's participation in the FSM and recognized her in Grenada. Concerned for her safety, SCLC sent Freeman back to Atlanta, where she worked in the main office and also as Coretta Scott King's assistant for six weeks. In October she was sent to work with SCLC's Chicago project. As the SCLC 's Chicago project faded out, Freeman went to work for a community newspaper, the \"West Side TORCH\". When this job ended she tried to find jobs as a journalist and photographer in Chicago, where she was told that girls can't cover riots. Eventually she found work as a re-write editor for a trade magazine, later becoming a freelance writer.\n\nIn June 1967 Freeman attended a \"free school\" course on women at the University of Chicago led by Heather Booth and Naomi Weisstein. She invited them to organize a woman's workshop at the then-forthcoming National Conference of New Politics (NCNP), to be held over Labor Day weekend 1967 in Chicago. A woman's caucus led by Freeman and Shulamith Firestone was formed at that conference and tried to present its own demands to the plenary session. The women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion and when through threatening to tie up the convention with procedural motions they succeeded in having their statement tacked to the end of the agenda, it was never discussed. When the National Conference for New Politics Director William F. Pepper refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about the American Indian, five women, including Firestone, rushed the podium to demand to know why. William F. Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, \"Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women's liberation,\" or possibly, \"Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\"\n\nFreeman and Firestone called a meeting of the women who had been at the \"free school\" course and the women's workshop at the conference—this became the first Chicago women's liberation group, known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman's apartment on Chicago's west side. After a few months Freeman started the newsletter \"Voice of the women's liberation movement.\" It circulated all over the country (and in a few foreign countries), and gave the new movement its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations including the Chicago Women's Liberation Union.\n\nIn the fall of 1968 Freeman enrolled in graduate school in political science at the University of Chicago. However, she took courses outside the discipline which would give her an opportunity to explore the research on women, sex roles and related topics. Most of the term papers she wrote were later published in various magazines and in college textbooks. When consciousness about women at the University was raised by a sit-in prompted by the firing of a popular female professor, Freeman led efforts to examine women's experiences at the University and in academia. These included teaching a \"free course\" on the legal and economic position of women early in 1969, chairing the student subcommittee of the new Committee on University Women, and organizing a major campus conference on women the following fall.\n\nAt the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association (APSA) in 1969, she helped to found the Women's Caucus for Political Science, eventually serving as its treasurer for one year. She also served on APSA's Committee on the Status of Women.\n\nAs a result of her publications, Freeman was invited to speak at many other colleges and universities, mostly in the Midwest. She spent the summers of 1970 and 1971 hitchhiking through Europe distributing feminist literature. Her lecture at the University of Oslo in 1970 is credited for sparking its first new feminist group. The literature she distributed was also a boon to feminists in the Netherlands.\n\nAlthough Freeman had not been active in Democratic Party politics since leaving California in 1965 (except for a brief stint on Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential campaign), she ran for delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention in order to put Shirley Chisholm's name on the ballot. She came in ninth out of 24 candidates in Chicago's first district and attended the convention as an alternate with the Chicago Challenge Delegation that unseated Mayor Daley's hand-picked slate. She later worked on California Senator Alan Cranston's 1984 Presidential campaign and became active in Democratic Party politics in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nFreeman wrote four classic feminist papers under her movement name \"Joreen\", which analyzed her experiences in the women's liberation movement. The most widely known is \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness,\" which argued there is no such thing as a structureless group; power is simply disguised and hidden when structure is unacknowledged and that all groups and organizations need clear lines of responsibility for democratic accountability, a notion that underlies the theory of democratic structuring. The 1969 \"BITCH Manifesto\" is considered an early example of language reclamation by a social movement, as well as a celebration of non-traditional gender roles. A third article, \"Trashing: The Dark Side of Sisterhood,\" illuminated an aspect of the women's movement that many participants experienced but few wanted to discuss openly. \"The 51 Percent Minority Group: A Statistical Essay\" appeared in the 1970 anthology \"\", edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nFreeman's 1973 dissertation analyzed the two branches of the women's movement, arguing that they were separated more by generation and experience than by ideology. What she called the \"younger branch\" was started by women with experience in civil rights, anti-war, and New Left student activism. The \"older branch\" was founded by women who had been members of or worked with the President's Commission on the Status of Women and related state Commissions. The latter branch gave rise to such organizations as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL). The resulting book, \"The Politics of Women's Liberation\", was published in 1975 and won the APSA's prize for the best scholarly work on women in politics. Freeman wrote The Bitch Manfesto in fall of 1968. In this work, Freeman notes that women are labeled as a bitch in society based on three principles, their personality, orientation, and physicality. Freeman argues that women that are labeled \"a bitch\" are often seen as aggressive or as a man hater. Jo Freeman asked women to embrace their inner bitch, noting that it is difficult to make societal change without angering people (and therefore receiving the bitch label). The Bitch Manifesto was disliked by many but, this made an impact on Feminism.\n\nIn 1977 Freeman became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP).\n\nFreeman is featured in the feminist history film \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\".\n\nBefore receiving her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1973, Freeman taught for four years at the State University of New York. She then spent two years in Washington, DC as a fellow at the Brookings Institution and then as an APSA Congressional Fellow. With an increasing interest in public policy, and unable to find a full-time appointment in academia, Freeman decided to study law after she was offered a Root-Tilden Scholarship at New York University School of Law. She received a J.D. degree in 1982 and was admitted to the New York State Bar the next year. She maintained a private practice in Brooklyn, New York for many years, serving as counsel to women running for political offices and to pro-choice demonstrators.\n\nFreeman has published 11 books and hundreds of articles. Most are on some aspect of women or feminism, but she also writes about social movements and political parties. Two of these are considered classics: \"On the Origins of Social Movements\" and \"The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties.\" \"Women: A Feminist Perspective\" went into five editions and for many years was the leading introductory women's studies textbook. \"A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics\" (2000) also won a prize for scholarship given at the APSA.\n\nShe has continued to attend the major party political conventions, but as a journalist. Many of her articles are posted to her webpage, as are some of her photographs of political events and a small selection from her button collection.\n\n\n\n"}

They are noted for their appearance with large highly-angled cylinders to accommodate a restricted loading gauge.\n\nThese locomotives were referred to by loco spotters as \"Crabs\", although the term \"Horwich mogul\" was preferred by the LMS. Several authors have claimed that this refers to the resemblance to a crab's pincers of the outside cylinders and valve motion. \nAnother suggestion is that the nickname refers to the \"scuttling\" motion felt on the footplate when the engine is being worked hard, due largely to the inclined cylinders, producing a sensation that it is walking along the track. In some areas they also received the nickname \"frothblowers\" from their tendency to prime easily when the boiler was overfilled, or the feedwater contaminated.\n\nDesigned by George Hughes, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LMS, and built at the ex-L&YR works at Horwich and the ex-LNWR works at Crewe, they were put into service by his successor, Henry Fowler. The design incorporated a number of advanced features for the time such as long travel valves, compensated brake gear, a new design of tender and a new boiler, the latter based on the one fitted to Hughes' four-cylinder Baltic tank locomotives built at Horwich.\n\nFowler tried to have the design altered to use standard Derby components. However the design process and pre-production were sufficiently advanced to prevent the fitting of a smaller Derby pattern boiler, and the cylinders and motion also remained as designed by Hughes. The tender was replaced by a Derby standard type, which was narrower than the cab. Standard Midland Railway boiler fittings and brake equipment were also substituted, and the class became something of a hybrid design. Nevertheless they performed rather well in most circumstances and gained a strong reputation in some areas, especially in Scotland, where they became the preferred locomotive for heavy unfitted mineral work on difficult routes, even after the introduction of the Stanier mixed traffic 4-6-0s.\n\n\nInitially numbered 13000–244, as standard locomotives they were given the lower numbers 2700–2944 in the LMS 1933 renumbering scheme. After being taken into British Railways stock an additional 40000 was added to their numbers, becoming 42700–42944.\n\nIn 1931 five engines, 13118, 13122, 13124, 13125 and 13129 were fitted with Lentz valve gear. They were renumbered as 42818, 42822, 42824, 42825 and 42829 after nationalisation. In 1953 the Lentz valve gear on these engines was replaced with Reidinger valve gear.\n\nTests at Rugby Locomotive Testing Station in 1954 indicated the design had a maximum steaming rate of . Modifications of the chimney and blast pipe improved the maximum rate to but no other engine was modified to leverage the advantage.\n\nWhen an order was placed by the traffic department for delivery of 40 more examples of this type, the new Chief Mechanical Engineer, William Stanier, decided to introduce a taper boiler version, in line with his policy of using taper boilers on all new locomotive designs. There were so many changes to the layout of the locomotive, such as higher boiler pressure and smaller cylinders, that it became a new design, the LMS Stanier Mogul.\n\nThe class survived intact until 1961 when three were withdrawn. The remainder of the class were withdrawn over the next six years.\n\nThree have survived to preservation\n\nNote: Loco numbers in bold mean their current number.\n\nModels exist in 00 gauge. An old and rather inaccurate model was produced by Lima, and an updated model has since been produced by Bachmann. N gauge models are produced by Graham Farish.\n\n"}

Such a seller is a special case in contract law. Ordinarily, a seller whose buyer breaches a contract and refuses to purchase the goods can recover from the breaching buyer only the difference between the contract price and the price for which the seller ultimately sells the goods to another buyer (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).\n\nIn the case of a lost volume seller, the seller goes on to sell the goods to someone else, usually for the same price. Under the usual measure of damages, such a seller would have no damages (the contract price less the sale price to the other customer is zero) and the breaching buyer would have no liability.\n\nThe objective of the law of contracts with respect to damages is to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as the aggrieved party would have been in if the breaching party had fully performed. The ordinary measure of damages fails to put the lost volume seller in as good a position as the lost volume seller would have been had the breaching buyer fully performed. The lost volume seller would have had the profit from two sales if the first buyer had performed instead of the profit from only one sale as a result of the first buyer’s breach. In such a case, certain law (including Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States) permits the aggrieved seller to recover the lost profit that the seller would have made had the buyer not breached (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).\n\nLost volume sellers tend to be those whose capacity to sell or to produce or acquire the subject goods is sufficiently large to meet the demands of all customers who seek to buy those goods. The term generally arises in the context of a breach of contract action in which the selling party seeks to recover against a breaching buyer who repudiates his or her promise to buy. For a lost volume seller, the failure to make one sale (i.e., due to the buyer's breach) reduces the seller's profits by the amount of profit that would accrue from that sale.\n\nFor example, suppose a T-shirt maker has 100 T-shirts. If a customer agrees to buy a shirt from the seller and then breaches that agreement (i.e. refuses to take delivery and pay), the seller will likely be able sell the shirt at the same price to the next customer who walks in. Such a seller has no damages by the usual measure (i.e., there is no difference between the contract price with the breaching buyer and the price paid by the buyer who subsequently bought the T-shirt).\n\nHowever, if that seller has the ability to sell a shirt to any customer that walks in, then the customer who breaches the agreement to buy has prevented the seller from earning profit that the seller would have earned had the agreement been honored. The initial buyer’s breach has caused the seller to receive the profit from only one sale (the sale to the second buyer) instead of the profit from two sales (the sale to the second buyer plus the sale for which the breaching buyer contracted).\n\nAccordingly, the T-shirt seller can recover from the breaching buyer the profit that the seller would have made on the sale of the T-shirt for which the breaching buyer contracted.\n\n"}

Written by Bala and Jainendra Jain, the film stars Salman Khan and Bhumika Chawla in her Hindi film debut. The film is a remake of Bala's own Tamil film \"Sethu\" (1999).\n\nThe film was based on a real-life incident of a friend of Bala's, who had fallen in love, lost his mind and ended up at a mental asylum.\n\n\"Tere Naam\" was released on 15 August 2003. Khan was praised for his portrayal of Radhe Mohan and the role is widely considered to be his finest performance till date. \"Tere Naam\" was nominated for a total of 24 Awards, winning 7 of them, including 8 Filmfare Award nominations. In 2011 Kaushik announced a sequel to \"Tere Naam\", thus he is currently working on the script.\n\nRajbir \"Radhe\" Mohan (Salman Khan) is a jobless rowdy, surrounded by a rouge circle. He lives with his brother (Sachin Khedekar), his sister-in-law (Savita Prabhune), and their child. He is a violent man, but often performs apparently good deeds, such as beating up sexual harassers.\n\nRadhe falls in love with Nirjara Bhardwaj (Bhumika Chawla), a student at his former college and the daughter of a poor temple priest. Radhe helps her a few times, and she seems to like him. One day, Radhe proposes to her, and jokingly remarks that he would beat up her father if he doesn't agree to their marriage. Nirjara is too shocked to say much, and utters \"Yes\" when Radhe asks her if she was listening to him. Radhe interprets this as her acceptance of the proposal. Later, he and his friends intimidate Nirjara's fiancé Rameshwar (Ravi Kishan). Next day, Radhe brings her a gift, but she tells him that she does not love him, and calls him a goon. A heartbroken Radhe subsequently tries to talk to her, but she refuses to engage in a conversation.\n\nRadhe's friends suggest that he give up rowdyism and violence to impress Nirjara, but one day, he roughs up a brothel owner who had beaten up one of his friends. As Radhe is about to punch the brothel owner, Nirjara arrives at the scene, and Radhe stops the violence, allowing the brothel owner to escape. Subsequently, Nirjara's elder sister Mamata, who is in need of money, is nearly tricked into prostitution, when she visits the brothel to meet a man who promises her a loan. Radhe, who does not know that she is Nirjara's sister, visits the same brothel to find a man who had harassed a woman. He saves Mamata from being arrested during a police raid. She tells him that her husband Aatmaram has evicted her, and is demanding money to give her the custody of their son. Next day, Radhe beats up Aatmaram, forcing him to take her back and to stop harassing her. Rameshwar sees this, and tells Nirjara that Radhe is a good, selfless man, who truly loves her. Unaware of this conversation, Radhe abducts Nirjara so that she would listen to him express his feelings for her. Nirjara initially feels intimidated, but ultimately falls in love with him.\n\nSubsequently, the brothel owner and his goons attack Radhe. Radhe suffers brain damage during the attack, and loses his mental balance. His family admits him to a religious institution for mental patients, as Nirjara and his friends pray for him. At one point, Radhe's mental state returns to normal, but the wardens do not understand this, and beat him up. Nirjara visits the institution and sees him in a pitiful condition while he is sleeping. Convinced that Radhe is not going to get well, Radhe's brother asks her to forget him and marry Rameshwar. On the day of Nirjara's wedding with Rameshwar, Radhe escapes from the institution, and arrives at her home, only to find that she has committed suicide. Radhe then allows himself to be taken back to the institution despite his family and friends trying to persuade him otherwise. The epilogue shows Radhe, now old and still in the institution, tying peacock feathers in Nirjara's memory.\n\nAmisha Patel was originally considered to play the role of Nirjara, but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting. The role was offered to Bhumika Chawla, who made her Bollywood debut in the film.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film contains 12 songs. The music is composed by Himesh Reshammiya and Sajid-Wajid with lyrics penned by Sameer and Jalees Sherwani. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 30,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's highest-selling.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc on 13 December 2010 by Eros International.\n\nTaran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama awarded 3/5 stars and wrote, \"Salman is exceptional in a role that fits him to the T. He breathes fire in sequences that demand uneasiness. But beneath the tough exterior lies a vulnerable person and this facet in particular comes to the fore in the latter reels. His emotional outbursts are splendid..., Bhoomika Chawla reminds you of Bhagyashree. Her simple, humble, traditionally indian character should go down very well with the viewers. Her performance is first-rate\".\n\nPlanet Bollywood rated 8.0/10 to the film and wrote, \"Salman Khan puts his heart and soul into his performance. He is equally at ease in romantic, emotional and even in Mahendra Verma's well conceived action scene. Bhoomika Chawla impresses in her first hindi movie. The supporting cast of Sachin Khedekar, Sarfaraz Khan and Ravi Kishan is reasonably good. The music by Himesh Reshammiya goes well with the movie\". Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India said, \"Salman has given the great performance in the film. He's given an intense, unconventional performance. Believe this is the best performance of Salman's career so far\".\n\nThe film's total gross was 24.54 crore worldwide.\n\n"}

{"id": "2020043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020043", "title": "Währing", "text": "Währing\n\nWähring () is the 18th district of Vienna and lies in northwestern Vienna on the edge of the Vienna Woods. It was formed in 1892 from the unification of the older suburbs of Währing, Weinhaus, Gersthof, Pötzleinsdorf, Neustift am Walde and Salmannsdorf. In 1938 Neustift am Walde and Salmannsdorf were annexed to the neighbouring 19th District (Döbling). Because of several wealthy neighbourhoods (e.g. Cottageviertel), Währing is known today as one of Vienna’s upmarket districts, along with Döbling and Hietzing.\n\nWähring covers 6.28 km2 in northwestern Vienna on the slopes of the Wienerwald between the Gürtel and the Höhenstraße. The district ascends from the steep banks of the (now channeled and enclosed) Währinger Stream on both sides. It is bordered to the north by the 19th District (Döbling), to the east by the 9th District (Alsergrund) and to the south and west by the 17th District (Hernals).\n\nWähring lies between two ridges to the north and south. The hills of Schafsberg and Michaelerberg belong to the Wienerwald and form part of the boundary of the Vienna Basin. The hills in Währing consist of multi-layered sandstone alternating with clay, except for the high grounds of Pötzleinsdorf and Türkenschanze, which are of sands. In the lower parts of the district one finds deposits of the stone tegel; at higher elevations mostly hard sands, rocks and boulders. On the road Schafberggasse limestone was uncovered during construction of a canal: due to the former location of the Tethys Ocean, various remnants of marine life can be found beneath the district. Numerous sand quarries in the area provided building material for centuries.\n\nWähring is enclosed between two elongated ridges extending from the northwest to the south and forming the valley of the Währinger Stream. The Schafberg range lies to the south, running from the largely forest-covered Schafberg (390 m) through Kleiner Schafberg (305 m), Mitterberg and Ganserlberg up to the Gürtel. To the north the district is bordered by spurs of the Michaelerberg (387 m), which lies on the western border with the 17th District and is almost completely forested. Its spurs extend through the Pötzleinsdorfer Höhe and the Windmühlhöhe to the southeast until they reach the plateau of Türkenschanze. The Ladenburghöhe, which border Pötzleinsdorfer Schlosspark to the south, lie between the two ridges and run parallel to and northeast of the Schafberg range.\n\nIn the 19th Century the district was still defined by the Währinger Stream, which rises in Pötzleinsdorfer Schlosspark. Originally this stream was in a deep valley along the route of the streets Pötzleinsdorfer Straße, Gersthofer Straße, Gentzgasse and Währinger Straße, and flowed into the River Als in the 9th District. By the end of the 19th Century it had been completely transformed into a drain. The last open-flowing part of the stream system is a stretch of the Dürwaring Stream, near Schafbergbad south of the Ladenburghöhe.\n\nThe district was formed in 1892 from six previously independent outer suburbs, of which Salmannsdorf and Neustift am Walde were annexed to the neighbouring 19th District in 1938. From east to west the remaining suburbs were Währing (the original, eponymous outer suburb), Weinhaus, Gersthof and Pötzleinsdorf.\n\nAn alternative subdivision of the district is given by the census areas used for official statistics. For Währing these are Währinger Cottage, Gentzgasse, Kreuzgasse, Gersthof and Pötzleinsdorf (with Gersthof and Pötzleinsdorf on this list having different boundaries from their respective historical suburbs).\n\nWähring comprises 53.6% built-up areas (compared to 33.2% Vienna-wide), of which 92.83% are residential. Green space occupies 30.2% of the district: woodland 14.4%, parkland 7.9%, meadows 3.0%, allotments 2.9%, sports fields 1.3% and agriculture (vineyards) 0.6%. Third come transport areas, which make up 16.2% of the total land area.\n\nThe first mention of Währing is in documents from around 1170, as \"Warich\". The name could plausibly come from Slavic (\"var\" for a warm spring) or Germanic (\"werich\" for a plot of land that a farmer can work for a day) origins. It could also come from Werigandus, the first abbot of Michaelbeuern Abbey. The name could also go back to Slavic land acquisitions: Döbling from \"toplica\", warm stream, and Währing from \"varica\", dark stream.\n\nAt the 2008 census the population of Währing was 47,861, down from a high point of 87,658 in 1910. The average age is slightly above that of Vienna as a whole. In 2001, the proportion of people over 60 was about 25% in Währing compared to 22.2% in the city as a whole.\n\nIn 2005 the proportion of expatriate residents stood at 19.7%, up from 17.9% in 2003. The greatest number of expats came from Serbia & Montenegro, 4.4% of the total population. Another 2.1% were German citizens, 1.6% Turkish, 1.4% Polish and 1.1% Croatian. According to a 2001 survey, 52.8% of the population declared themselves Catholic, with significant minorities belonging to the Orthodox Church, Islam, and Evangelic churches. The five Roman Catholic parishes in the district make up the 18th City Deanery.\n\nInteresting castles and villas include the Geymüllerschlössel, the Schloss Pötzleinsdorf with its extensive parks, and numerous villas in the Cottageviertel. The Baroque churches in the district are Ägydiuskirche (St. Giles' church) in Pötzleinsdorf, the Johannes Nepomuk Chapel in Gersthof and the Währinger Pfarrkirche, which was greatly expanded in 1934. Several churches were built in the historicism style: the Gersthofer Pfarrkirche, Lazaristenkirche, the Lutherkirche and the Wienhauser Pfarrkirche. The Pötzleinsdorfer Pfarrkircher is a notable church building from the 1960s.\n\nCurrently there are three small stages in the district, the “Theater des Augenblicks”, the “Rampenlicht-Theater” and the “Theaterlabor”.\n\nWähring’s most important museum is a branch of the Museum of Applied Arts (MAK) in the Geymüllerschlössel in Pötzleinsdorf. There is also the Währing District Museum and the Österreichische Sprachinselmuseum.\n\nWähring has several large parks. The best known are the Pötzleinsdorfer Schlosspark, Türkenschanzpark, and the Währingerpark (formerly a cemetery). The Schubert Park (see below) and the non-public Sternwartepark (“Observatory Park”) are also noteworthy.\n\nWähring has two cemeteries of note. The cemetery, Währing Cemetery; now known as Schubert Park; is the site of the original burial places of composers Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. The graves of both composers were moved to the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna in 1888, but there remains a bust of Schubert in memory of his original resting place. This bust was made by sculptor Josef A. Dialer. The epitaph written by Franz Grillparzer reads in German: \"Die Tonkunst begrub hier einen reichen Besitz aber noch viel schönere Hoffnungen\" (The art of music buried here a rich possession and yet much finer hopes.) \n\nThe Jewish Cemetery, Währing, opened in 1784, was the main burial site for members of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien and formerly lay within the border of Währing. (Today, however, due to boundary changes, the cemetery, despite its name, is no longer part of the 18th Vienna district of Währing, but belongs to Döbling, the 19th district.) Besides the St. Marx Cemetery it is the last remaining cemetery of Vienna in the Biedermeier style. After its closure in the 1880s, it was partially destroyed during the time of the Third Reich, and is now only partly accessible due to its increasing decay. A long-running debate over the restoration of the cemetery has been taking place since 2006 between politicians of the federal and local levels as well as experts.\n\nThe asteroid 226 Weringia was discovered in 1882 from Währing and named in its honor.\n\n"}
{"id": "2020047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020047", "title": "Naked yoga", "text": "Naked yoga\n\nNaked yoga (Sanskrit \"nagna yoga\" or \"vivastra yoga\") is the practice of yoga without clothes. It has existed since ancient times as a spiritual practice, and is mentioned in the 7th-10th century \"Bhagavata Purana\" and by the Ancient Greek geographer Strabo.\n\nEarly advocates of naked yoga in modern times include the gymnosophists such as Blanche de Vries, and the author Marguerite Agniel.\n\nIn the 21st century, the practice is gaining popularity, notably in western societies that have more familiarity with social nudity.\n\nYoga has been practiced naked since ancient times. In the Bhagavata Purana (written c. 800–1000 AD) it says: \n\nAlexander the Great reached India in the 4th century BC. Along with his army, he took Greek academics with him who later wrote memoirs about geography, people and customs they saw. One of Alexander's companion was Onesicritus, quoted in Book 15, Sections 63-65 by Strabo, who describes yogins of India. Onesicritus claims those Indian yogins (\"Mandanis \") practiced aloofness and \"different postures – standing or sitting or lying naked – and motionless\".\n\nThe practice of spiritual nudity is common among Digambara Jains, Aghori sadhus, and other ascetic groups in the dharmic religions. The order of Naga Sadhus, conspicuous in the processions and bathing ritual at the Kumbh Mela, use nudity as a part of their spiritual practice of renunciation.\n\nModern naked yoga has been practiced in Germany and Switzerland through a movement called Lebensreform. The movement had since the end of the 19th century highlighted yoga and nudity.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the term gymnosophy was appropriated by several groups who practiced nudity, asceticism and meditation. Blanche de Vries combined a popularity of Oriental dancing with yoga. In 1914 she was put in charge of a yoga school for women in New York City. Five years later, she opened an institute for women, teaching Yoga Gymnosophy — a name that conveys the blending of yoga and nudism. She taught until 1982.\n\nMarguerite Agniel, author of the 1931 book \"The Art of the Body : Rhythmic Exercise for Health and Beauty\", wrote a piece called \"The Mental Element in Our Physical Well-Being\" for \"The Nudist\", an American magazine, in 1938; it showed nude women practising yoga, accompanied by a text on attention to the breath. The social historian Sarah Schrank comments that it made perfect sense at this stage of the development of yoga in America to combine nudism and yoga, as \"both were exercises in healthful living; both were countercultural and bohemian; both highlighted the body; and both were sensual without being explicitly erotic.\"\n\nIn the West since the 1960s, naked yoga practice has been incorporated in the hippie movement and in progressive settings for well-being, such as at the Esalen Institute in California, and at the Elysium nudist colony in the Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles.\n\nAaron Star, owner of Hot Nude Yoga, began his version of naked yoga in April 2001. The style combined elements of Ashtanga, Kundalini, and Contact Yoga with elements of Tantra.\nBecause of the success of Hot Nude Yoga, male-only naked yoga groups began to blossom all over the world, from London, Moscow, Madrid to Sydney, often becoming associated with the gay community. Nowadays, there are also specific naked yoga clubs for homosexuals that are not simple yoga classes, but rather communities for keeping fit and sharing sexuality. Star says that his practice affords men in cities a way to express closeness and intimacy without having sex.\n\nSchrank writes that \"the most press\" has however gone to Joschi Schwartz and Monika Werner's Bold and Naked studio in New York. It provides classes in tantric massage as well as both male-only and co-ed naked yoga. She praises its \"positive coverage\" as helping yogis of all kinds to feel good, but is concerned about the contradictory message that yoga is simultaneously \"liberating and sexy\".\n\nWhile naked yoga had mainly been the domain of male only groups, from 2011 courses in Britain and the United States were offered to all genders.\n\nSchrank noted the popularity of naked yoga in 2016, with its simultaneous desire to experience one's own body in freedom, and a \"troubling\" sexualization of the body in yoga culture. She observed that in the United States, there is a connection between female nudity and slavery, something that has left a racist legacy. Schrank noted also the \"uncomfortable\" relationship of yoga and sex, not least in scandals of sexual abuse by yoga gurus, and that feminists have written critiques of the \"objectification of young, white women and exclusion of women of color.\" On the other hand, she praises the naked yoga teacher Katrina \"Rainsong\" Messenger's book \"R.A.W. Nude Yoga: Celebrating the Human Body Temple\", featuring monochrome photographs of both men and women, as impressive, tasteful, and sensual but not erotic. Schrank personally tried a naked yoga class in Los Angeles, at first finding it safe and pleasurable because not sexualized, until after two months the experience was spoiled by a class which was sexist and \"overtly sexually competitive\".\n\nEsalen's naked yoga was depicted in the 1968 comedy film \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\". \nOther film depictions include the 1967 \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\" with Lena Nyman, the 1973 \"The Harrad Experiment\" and that same year the short documentary \"Naked Yoga\". \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2020051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020051", "title": "Aberdeenshire Canal", "text": "Aberdeenshire Canal\n\nThe Aberdeenshire Canal was a waterway in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, designed by John Rennie, which ran from the port of Aberdeen to Port Elphinstone, Inverurie. It was originally planned to reach Monymusk, but had been truncated by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1796. Construction was hampered by a lack of finance, and some local opposition, but it opened in 1805. Some of the workmanship was sub-standard, and several of the locks failed soon afterwards, but they were reconstructed, and in reopened in late 1806.\n\nIt was used for the carriage of a wide variety of cargo, and passenger services were also introduced. These proved popular, and two boats a day made the journey during the summer months, with one in the winter. They gradually faced competition from the adjacent turnpike road, which was quicker but more expensive. A connecting lock was built in 1834, to enable boats to enter Aberdeen harbour, which eased the problem of transhipping goods to larger vessels. The canal normally closed between December and March each year, due to icing.\n\nIt was never a financial success, and the shareholders did not receive any dividends during its life. Negotiations began in 1845 with the Great North of Scotland Railway, who eventually bought it. Contractors working for the railway company drained much of the canal before any money had changed hands, and the breach had to be repaired. The canal was finally closed in early 1854, so that the railway could lay tracks along its course. The line from to Huntly was completed by September 1854.\n\nBecause the railway took a straighter course than the canal, there are some locations where evidence for the canal can still be seen. A scenic walk has been created at Port Elphinstone, part of which follows a channel labelled \"Old Canal\" on Ordnance Survey maps, but this is thought to be of later construction than the canal, and served a mill.\n\nThe canal was originally conceived as part of a bigger scheme to link Aberdeen to Monymusk, via Inverurie, with a branch from Inverurie along the course of the Ury Glen to Insch. Captain George Taylor conducted a survey, which confirmed that the plan was feasible, in 1793, but by the time a subscription list was started, the plans had been truncated, with just the section from Aberdeen to Inverurie remaining. Advertisements appeared in the local press, listing the benefits of the enterprise, which included increasing the value of certain stone quarries and land. By 1795, some £11,000 had been pledged, and a general meeting was held, at which the subscribers decided that work would commence as soon at subscriptions reached £14,000. Notices were placed in the press, encouraging those wanted to see the canal completed to come forward and pledge their support. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 26 April 1796, which created \"The Company of Proprietors of the Aberdeenshire Canal Navigation\", and authorised them to raise £20,000 in £50 shares. No person was permitted to have less than one share or more than 40. If required, they could raise an additional £10,000 either by issuing more shares, or by mortgaging the tolls which would be collected.\n\nJohn Rennie was engaged as the consulting engineer, with Thomas Fletcher as resident engineer. Contractors were shown the line of the canal in March 1797, and the Parliamentary Commissioners held meetings to resolve issues between the land owners and the proprietors of the canal. The start of the work was delayed by Rennie's suggestion that the size of the channel should be increased. Meanwhile, land was being advertised in Inverurie, on the assumption that construction of the canal would result in factories and other public works being built. By 1798, the company was advertising for masons to build three locks, and for contractors to cut and puddle some of the canal bed. Plans for a turnpike road from Inverurie to Aberdeen were passed in 1799, and there was some opposition to the canal construction. A reward of £5 was offered to anyone supplying information which led to the conviction of those who were throwing stones and rubbish into the cut, and generally damaging the works and boats. Offenders were warned that if caught, they could face transportation for 7 years.\n\nBy 1800, Fletcher was worried that he might lose his job, as a result of the shortage of funds and the levels of compensation paid to landowners. He therefore asked Rennie if he could move on, and in 1801 obtained a post as Superintendent for the construction of Union Bridge in Aberdeen. The project was facing severe financial difficulty and another Act was submitted to Parliament. In the Act, dated 24 March 1801, the company noted that of the £20,000 authorized by the previous Act, only £17,800 had been subscribed. They obtained powers to raise another £20,000, in £20 shares, on which interest at five per cent would be paid. The preamble to the Act stated that much of the canal had been completed, but that the company had tried and failed to raise any more money. Interest on the new shares would be paid once receipts from the tolls allowed, and the full five per cent would be paid before any returns were made against the original shares. The company hoped to sell the new shares to the existing shareholders, but not all of them were keen to expand their holdings. A public sale of shares in September 1801 raised £11,421.\n\nThe proprietors were faced with regular complaints by the workmen that they were being obstructed in their work by detractors. In an effort to resolve this, the company reminded the public of the many benefits that the canal would bring. They advertised for contractors to complete the final section down to the harbour in February 1803, but in March were meeting to discuss how this might be funded, as they were again short of funds. There were ongoing issues with compensation to landowners, and in 1804 the company decided to lease the tolls for the first three years of operation. William Kennedy was granted the lease, and the arrangement raised £10,000 as a mortgage. The main material into which the canal was cut was granite, some of which was quarried and transported to London.\n\nThe canal eventually opened in early June 1805. The Committee of Management met at Inverurie, where they were congratulated on completing the task by the Provost, Magistrates, minister and others. They set off in the barge \"The Countess of Kintore\", suitably decorated for the occasion, and travelled to Kintore, where they were met by the Magistrates and other inhabitants. Several groups of ladies joined them as they approached Aberdeen, and travelled through the locks. Crowds gathered on the banks, and refreshments were served on the boat. The band of the Stirlingshire Militia accompanied them for the final few miles. After seven and a half hours, they reached the terminal basin next to the docks, and retired to the New Inn for dinner and toasts. Fourteen of the locks failed within the first few months, and reconstruction of the masonry resulted in the canal being shut until October 1806. The engineer Thomas Telford approved the substantial reconstruction. A third Act of Parliament was passed on 13 March 1809, which enabled the company to raise a further £45,000 for work on the canal, but it seems probable that its powers were never used.\n\nThe canal ran up the strath of the River Don from Aberdeen for a total of to a terminus just south of Inverurie. The terminus area came to be known as Port Elphinstone after Sir James Elphinstone, who was a keen supporter and financier of the canal. He lived nearby at Logie House near Oyne and Pitcaple. The canal had 17 locks, all in the first between Aberdeen harbour and Stoneywood, together with 56 road bridges, 20 culverts and five aqueducts. From Stoneywood it ran level to Port Elphinstone and was used to carry both freight and passenger boats. Passengers were only carried on the top section, and disembarked at a building called the Boathouse, situated above the five St Machar Drive locks. The fall from Stoneywood to the low water mark at Aberdeen was . As originally built, it was about wide and deep. John Rennie suggested it should be wide and deep, and although it was enlarged in the first six years, it was only increased to wide and deep.\n\nThe original act had specified the maximum tolls that could be charged, ranging from 4 pence per ton per mile for hay, straw, dung peat and materials intended to be used as manure of for roadbuilding, 5 pence for corn, flour, coal, coke, iron, lime and most building materials, to 6 pence for timber, manufactured goods and anything not covered by the previous lists. The company could also charge \"reasonable tolls\" for any goods that were left on their wharfs for more than 48 hours. The actual rates charged were considerably less than the specified rates, being 1.5, 2 and 2.25 pence for the three categories. From July 1807, passengers were charged 2 shillings for the journey from Aberdeen to Kintore or Inverurie, and 2 pence per mile for shorter journeys. The passenger boats left Aberdeen in the morning and returned later in the day, running three days per week. In September 1808, they started running every day, and there were three rates for various classes. Thus passengers in the fore cabin paid 2s 6d, those in the after cabin paid 1s 6d, and those who travelled outside were charged 1s.\n\nThe canal created many benefits for the local community. Passenger boats ran twice daily during the summer months, but from 1816, some of their traffic was taken by coaches running on the turnpike road, which were quicker but more expensive. With easier transport, quarries near Kintore were able to obtain a contract to supply of granite for a major project at Sheerness. The Farmer Lime Company ensured that there were supplies of lime and coal available at Inverurie and Kintore, and a covered barge was obtained to improve the shipment of grain. Granaries were erected beside the canal at Inverurie. Inverurie prospered, with its population rising from around 500 when construction of the canal started, to 2,020 in 1841. Kintore, which was the principal depot for the canal, showed a more modest increase, from 863 in 1811 to 1,299 in 1841. There were other benefits about which the company were less happy. They issued warnings to try to prevent the banks of the canal being damaged by people driving cattle to water, and using the banks for washing with tubs. More tragically, there were a number of cases where unwanted newborn babies were drowned in the canal.\n\nThere was initially no direct connection to the Aberdeen docks, which made transshipment difficult, and it was not until 1834 that a sea lock was constructed, enabling boats to enter the docks at certain states of the tide. The work was funded by those who held mortgages agreeing to forgo their dividends for a period, and the total cost was around £1,500. The weather also created problems, with the canal normally being shut between December and March due to icing.\n\nThe canal was never a financial success. It had cost nearly £44,000 to build, and revenues rose from £311 in 1807, the first full year of operation, to just £3062 in 1853, the last full year of operation.\n\nPlans for a railway from the south to Aberdeen were announced in 1844, and later that year, there were proposals to continue the line northwards, to reach Inverness. This would be called the Great North of Scotland Railway, and in 1845, they approached the canal company, to explore whether they could buy the canal and use it for their track bed. The canal had received £1,659 from tolls in 1844, and the passenger boats had made a profit of £200. The company predicted that revenues for 1845 would be around £200 higher than in 1844. Although the railway looked at an alternative plan, with the railway some distance from the canal, this was not needed, as their offer of £36,000 was accepted. The railway would inherit the privileges and liabilities of the canal company, and would therefore compensate several companies who had built granaries, sheds and wharfs to enable them to trade on the canal. The £36,000 was to be transferred on 1 April 1848, but the railway company were unable to complete the transaction, due to the state of the money market. The canal company agreed to the delay, but began adding interest at 5.5 per cent to the capital sum.\n\nThe line would be single track, and the construction costs, which included the cost of the canal, were very favourable compared to other lines. In 1852, construction began at Port Elphinstone, westwards towards Huntly. This ensured that the canal could remain open for as long as possible. Despite the fact that the canal had not yet been bought by the railway, the contractors Erskine and Carstairs cut through the bank at Kintore, and drained the entire upper section from Port Elphinstone to Stoneybank. With the barges grounded, the canal company complained, and the bank was hastily repaired and the canal refilled. Some of the proprietors of the canal agreed to take railway shares in lieu of compensation for their canal shares, and the railway made an interim payment of £20,000, from which claims would be paid to the bondholders and shareholders. In February 1854, the canal company had received £39,272 from the railway, representing the original purchase price plus the interest. In 1848, the mortgage debt and the interest on it was around £18,600. The shareholders had never received any dividends, and thus were unlikely to recover the capital they had invested. The money was distributed without any distinction to holders of the old £50 shares and the new £20 shares.\nThe canal was closed in early 1854 so that railway tracks could be laid along much of its length. The railway opened in September of that year. Sir J D H Elphinstone, Sir Andrew Leith Hay, together with various other ladies and gentlemen, rode in a special train, consisting of an engine and two carriages, from , in Aberdeen, to Huntly, and found the entire line to be in good order. An official opening took place several days later, and the \"Aberdeen Journal\" described the route, mentioning the importance of Port Elphinestone as a centre for trade, caused by its former position as the terminus of the canal.\n\nSome fragments of the original canal construction may be discerned along the route of the railway. Within Aberdeen these include where the railway runs parallel to Elmbank Terrace, Kittybrewster (at the foot of which road is an elderly bridge carrying the road diagonally over the railway), and again where the railway runs parallel to Great Northern Road in Woodside. Dyce and Dalwearie also have obvious remains. Woodside still has a canal bridge which is in use for the road only with nothing now running underneath; the railway is slightly to the north at this point. It was once well outside the bounds of the city proper, and so both that area and Old Aberdeen still boast roads named Canal Street, which sometimes leads to confusion.\n\nThe original canal structure can be seen alongside the Ruschlach road to the south of Kintore.\nCanal milestones remain at Bridgend House (formerly the Bridgealehouse serving the canal) at the north of Kintore, and at Brae Farm at the south of Kintore.\n\nAt Port Elphinstone, by Inverurie, there is a short section of open water, about in length, and a circular walkway has been created at the northern end. The footpath continues along the west bank of the channel until the end of the watered section at the site of the old Inverurie Paper Mill, where it drains into the River Don. Although this is labelled \"Old Canal\" on maps published by the Ordnance Survey, Graham contended that it was only a lade supplying water to Tait and Son's mill, as he thought it was a new section built after the closure of the canal rather than a refurbishment of the existing canal. Pearson however quotes evidence that the lade was originally part of the canal: being shown as such in estate plans dated 1810, in canal and railway plans of the 1840s, and in maps produced after the closure of the canal. Also the structure of the lade, seen when drained, is consistent with that for a canal with the towpath along the eastern bank.\n\n30 feet of the Canal at Port Elphinstone was blocked with rubble and fenced-off when a little boy died after falling through ice on the canal on a freezing February night in 2003. Following Storm Frank in December 2015, the canal flooded and filled with silt and debris. In a remediation programme as advised by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), the operators have blocked off the west arm of the northern part of the remaining canal at the River Don, in order to flush out the newer east arm of the canal.\n\n\n\n"}

Taraba's capital is Jalingo.\n\nThe state was created out of the former Gongola State on 27 August 1991, by the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nTaraba State is bounded in the west by Nasarawa State and Benue State, northwest by Plateau State, north by Bauchi State and Gombe State, northeast by Adamawa State, east and south by Cameroon.\n\nTaraba State lies largely within the middle of Nigeria and consists of undulating landscape dotted with a few mountainous features. These include the scenic and prominent Mambilla Plateau. The state lies largely within the tropical zone and has a vegetation of low forest in the southern part and grassland in the northern part. The Mambilla Plateau with an altitude of 1,800 meters (6000 ft) above sea level has a temperate climate all year round.\n\nThe Benue, Donga, Taraba and Ibi are the main rivers in the state. They rise from the Cameroonian mountains, straining almost the entire length of the state in the North and South direction to link up with the River Niger.\n\nTaraba State consists of sixteen (16) Local Government Areas (or LGAs). They are governed by elected chairmen. They are as follows:\nLanguages of Taraba State listed by LGA:\n\nOther languages spoken in Taraba State are Akum, Bukwen, Esimbi, Fali of Baissa, Jiba, Njerep, Tha, Yandang, Yotti, Ywom.\n\nThe major occupation of the people of Taraba State is agriculture. Cash crops produced in the state include coffee, tea, groundnuts and cotton. Crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, millet, cassava, and yam are also produced in commercial quantity. In addition, cattle, sheep and goats are reared in large numbers, especially on the Mambilla Plateau, and along the Benue and Taraba valleys. Similarly, the people undertake other livestock production activities like poultry production, rabbit breeding and pig farming in fairly large scale. Communities living on the banks of River Benue, River Taraba, River Donga and Ibi engage in fishing all year round. Other occupational activities such as pottery, cloth-weaving, dyeing, mat-making, carving, embroidery and blacksmithing are also carried out in various parts of the State.\n\nThe government has made concerted efforts to improve areas of tourist attractions like Mambilla Tourist Center, Gumpti Park and game reserve in Gashaka; and the Nwunyu fishing festival in Ibi, which is usually held in April of each year where activities such as canoe racing, swimming competition and cultural dances are held. Other festivals are Purma of the Chamba in Donga, Takum and jibu culture dance in Bali, the Puje of Jukuns, Kuchecheb of Kutebs in Takum and Ussa, Kati of the Mambilla and host of others. Taraba is called \"Nature's gift to the nation\" as the state is rich and have many ethnic groups, including Jenjo, Jibana, Kuteb Chamba, Yandang, Mumuyes, Mambila, Wurkums, Fulanis, Jukun, Ichen, Tiv, Kaka, Pena, Kambu, Wawa, Vute, Hausa and Ndola.\n\nA striking historical fact about the State is that it encompasses part of the Mambilla Region which is famed as the Bantu cradle, having been occupied for some five millennia to date (Schwartz, 1972; Zeitlyn & Connell, 2003).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2020081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020081", "title": "Ameloblastoma", "text": "Ameloblastoma\n\nAmeloblastoma is a rare, benign or cancerous tumor of odontogenic epithelium (ameloblasts, or outside portion, of the teeth during development) much more commonly appearing in the lower jaw than the upper jaw. It was recognized in 1827 by Cusack. This type of odontogenic neoplasm was designated as an \"adamantinoma\" in 1885 by the French physician Louis-Charles Malassez. It was finally renamed to the modern name \"ameloblastoma\" in 1930 by Ivey and Churchill.\n\nWhile these tumors are rarely malignant or metastatic (that is, they rarely spread to other parts of the body), and progress slowly, the resulting lesions can cause severe abnormalities of the face and jaw leading to severe disfiguration. Additionally, as abnormal cell growth easily infiltrates and destroys surrounding bony tissues, wide surgical excision is required to treat this disorder. If an aggressive tumor is left untreated, it can obstruct the nasal and oral airways making it impossible to breathe without oropharyngeal intervention. The term \"ameloblastoma\" is from the early English word \"amel\", meaning enamel and the Greek word \"blastos\", meaning germ.\n\nFour types of ameloblastoma have been described by the WHO 2017 classification:\n\n\nPreviously known as solid/multicystic ameloblastoma. Usually presents with multiple large cystic areas.\n\nAmeloblastoma with a single cyst cavity account for around 10% of ameloblastomas. Present in younger patients in their second and third decades of life, often in relation to unerupted third molar.\n\nHistologically atypical ameloblastoma can, rarely, lead to metastasis, usually in the lung. 'Metastasis' look histologically identical to the primary tumour and are benign in nature.\n\nThe peripheral subtype composes 2% of all ameloblastomas.\n\nAmeloblastomas can be found both in the maxilla and mandible. Although, 80% are situated in the mandible with the posterior ramus area being the most frequent site. The neoplasms are often associated with the presence of unerupted teeth, displacement of adjacent teeth and resorption of roots.\n\nSymptoms include a slow-growing, painless swelling leading to facial deformity. As the swelling gets progressively larger it can impinge on other structures resulting in loose teeth and malocclusion. Bone can also be perforated leading to soft tissue involvement.\n\nThe lesion has a tendency to expand the bony cortices because the slow growth rate of the lesion allows time for the periosteum to develop a thin shell of bone ahead of the expanding lesion. This shell of bone cracks when palpated. This phenomenon is referred to as \"Egg Shell Cracking\" or crepitus, an important diagnostic feature.\n\nMaxillary ameloblastomas can be dangerous and even lethal. Due to thin bone and weak barriers, the neoplasm can extend into the sinonasal passages, pterygomaxillary fossa and eventually into the cranium and brain. Rare orbital invasion of the neoplasm has also been reported.\n\nConventional ameloblastomas have both cystic and solid neoplastic structures.\n\nSolid areas contain fibrous tissue islands or epithelium that interconnect through strands and sheets. The epithelial cells tend to move the nucleus away from the basement membrane to the opposite pole of the cell. This process is called \"reverse polarization\". Two main histological patterns most often occur: \"follicular\" and \"plexiform\". Other less common histological variants include \"acanthomatous\", \"basal cell\", and \"granular cell\" patterns.\n\nThe most common follicular type has an outer arrangement of columnar or palisaded ameloblasts-like cells and inner zone of triangular shaped cells resembling stellate reticulum from the bell stage of tooth development.\n\nThe plexiform type has epithelium that proliferates in a \"Fish Net Pattern\". The plexiform ameloblastoma shows epithelium proliferating in a 'cord like fashion', hence the name 'plexiform'. There are layers of cells in between the proliferating epithelium with well-formed desmosomal junctions, simulating spindle cell layers. The ameloblasts cells can be less prominent.\n\nLarge cysts up to a few centimetres in diameter can be found. In follicular type, cysts develop in the stellate reticulum and in the plexiform type, cysts are caused by degeneration of connective tissue stroma.\n\nA distinctive histological variant of conventional ameloblastoma. Found in near equal frequencies in both maxilla and mandible. Resemble a fibro-osseous lesion with no obvious ameloblasts whilst dominated by dense collagenous tissue (desmoplastic). In one center, desmoplastic ameloblastomas represented about 9% of all ameloblastomas encountered. A systematic review showed a predilection for males and predominance in fourth and fifth decades in life. 52% desmoplastic ameloblastomas showed mandibular involvement, with a tendency to anterior region. Majority of tumours were found to have ill-defined margins radiographically. \n\nAmeloblastoma is tentatively diagnosed through radiographic examination and must be confirmed by histological examination through biopsy.\n\nRadiographically, the tumour area appears as a rounded and well-defined lucency in the bone with varying size and features. Numerous cyst-like radiolucent areas can be seen in larger tumours (multi-locular) giving a characteristic \"soap bubble\" appearance. A single radiolucent area can be seen in smaller tumours (unilocular). The radiodensity of an ameloblastoma is about 30 Hounsfield units, which is about the same as keratocystic odontogenic tumours. However, ameloblastomas show more bone expansion and seldom show high density areas.\n\nLingual plate expansion is helpful in diagnosing ameloblastoma as cysts rarely do this. Resorption of roots of involved teeth can be seen in some cases, but is not unique to ameloblastoma.\n\n\nWhile chemotherapy, radiation therapy, curettage and liquid nitrogen have been effective in some cases of ameloblastoma, surgical resection or enucleation remains the most definitive treatment for this condition. However, in a detailed study of 345 patients, chemotherapy and radiation therapy was contraindicated for the treatment of ameloblastomas. Thus, surgery is the most common treatment of this neoplasm. Conservative treatment requires very careful case selection.\n\nThe aim of treatment and surgery is to remove the entire tumour with a margin of surrounding tissue (block resection) for a good prognosis. Preferable removal includes 10mm of normal bone around the neoplasm. Larger ameloblastomas can require partial resection of the jaw bone followed by bone grafting. There is evidence that the treatment of conventional ameloblastoma is best done by bone resection. A systematic review found that 79% of desmoplastic ameloblastoma cases were treated by resection.\n\nSmaller mandibular neoplasms have been enucleated where the cavity of the tumour is curetted, allowing preservation of the bone cortex and the lower border of the mandible. Although, recurrence rate for this type of treatment is higher. Unicystic ameloblastomas—called \"intraluminal unicystic\" or \"plexiform unicystic\" ameloblstomas can be enucleated, as the epithelium is only limited to the inner cyst wall and lumen.\n\nRadiation is ineffective in many cases of ameloblastoma. There have also been reports of sarcoma being induced as the result of using radiation to treat ameloblastoma. Chemotherapy is also often ineffective. However, there is some controversy regarding this and some indication that some ameloblastomas might be more responsive to radiation that previously thought.\n\nPersistent follow-up examination including radiographs is essential for managing ameloblastoma. Follow-up should occur at regular intervals for at least 10 years. Follow up is important, because 50% of all recurrences occur within 5 years postoperatively.\n\nRecurrence is common, although the recurrence rates for block resection followed by bone graft are lower than those of enucleation and curettage. Follicular variants appear to recur more than plexiform variants. Unicystic lesions recur less frequently than \"non-unicystic\" lesions. A low recurrence rate of around 10% can be seen in unicystic ameloblastomas. Recurrence within a bone graft (following resection of the original tumor) does occur, but is less common. Seeding to the bone graft is suspected as a cause of recurrence. The recurrences in these cases seem to stem from the soft tissues, especially the adjacent periosteum. Recurrence has been reported to occur as many as 36 years after treatment. To reduce the likelihood of recurrence within grafted bone, meticulous surgery with attention to the adjacent soft tissues is required.\n\n\"BRAF\" V600E gene and \"SMO\" gene mutations have been found in ameloblastomas. V600E mutation is also seen in other malignant and benign neoplasms, which activate the MAP kinase pathway required for cell division and differentiation but is the most commonly seen mutation in ameloblastoma. 72% of \"BRAF\" mutations are found in the mandible. A recent study discovered a high frequency of \"BRAF\" V600E mutations (15 of 24 samples, 63%) in conventional ameloblastoma. These data suggests drugs targeting mutant \"BRAF\" as potential novel therapies for ameloblastoma.\n\nSMO mutations lead to the activation of the hedgehog pathway giving similar results as V600E but is less frequently seen. 55% of SMO mutations are found in the maxilla.\n\nEvidence shows that suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 may inhibit the local invasiveness of ameloblastoma, however, this was only demonstrated \"in vitro\". There is also some research suggesting that αβ integrin may participate in the local invasiveness of ameloblastomas.\n\nPeople with African heritage have been shown to have a higher incidence compared to Caucasians, with the site often being in the midline of the mandible. The annual incidence rates per million for ameloblastomas are 1.96, 1.20, 0.18 and 0.44 for black males, black females, white males and white females respectively. Ameloblastomas account for about one percent of all oral tumors and about 18% of odontogenic tumors. Men and women are equally affected, though women average four years younger than men when tumors first occur, and tumors run larger in females.\n\n"}

She had relationships with Mickey Cohen and Jack Ruby.\n\nAfter serving three years in prison, Barr began a new life in South Texas. She briefly returned to stripping in the late 1960s, posed for \"Oui\" magazine in the 1970s, and then retired.

At the age of 14, she reportedly married her first husband, Billy Joe Debbs (or Dabbs), an alleged safecracker, but the marriage ended after Debbs was sent to prison. She also worked as a cocktail waitress and cigarette girl before eventually becoming an exotic dancer.\n\nAt age 16, Barr appeared in one of the most famous and widely circulated of the early underground pornographic films, \"Smart Alec\" (1951). Because of the widespread \"underground\" distribution and popularity of this short hardcore 8mm movie, which is no more than 15 minutes long, she has been called \"the first porn star.\"\n\nShe originally told a men's magazine that she did the film for the money, as she then had less than a dollar to her name at the time. Many years later, Barr instead insisted that she was drugged and coerced into appearing in the movie. Shortly after the release of \"Smart Alec,\" and while still underage, she was hired as a stripper at the Theater Lounge in Dallas by Barney Weinstein for $85 a week. She acquired the stage name \"Candy Barr\" at this time (given to her by Weinstein, reportedly because of her fondness for Snickers bars), bleached her hair platinum blond, and quickly became a headliner.\n\nShe worked at Weinstein's Colony Club, with a large placard of her prominently displayed out front. Barr established herself in burlesque and striptease with her trademark costume of a cowboy hat, pasties, scant panties, a pair of pearl-handled cap six-shooters in a holster strapped low on her hips, and cowboy boots. When the Theater Lounge would close, she would often patronize the after-hours Vegas Club, where she became acquainted with the owner and operator, Jack Ruby, in about 1952. Their friendship was very casual, however, as she never worked for him and never associated with him outside the Vegas Club and the Silver Spur Inn, which he also operated.\n\nBarr reportedly married her second husband, Troy B. Phillips, around 1953 and had a daughter about 1954. In January 1956, Barr shot her estranged and violent husband when he kicked in the door of her apartment in Dallas. She was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, but the charges were later dropped. Phillips was not fatally wounded.\n\nBarr performed for the only time on the legitimate stage in 1957, playing the role of Rita Marlowe in the Dallas Little Theater production of \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" In late October of that year, in yet another notorious case, Dallas police raided her apartment and found four-fifths of an ounce of marijuana, which was said to be hidden in her bra. She was arrested for drug possession, subsequently convicted, and received a 15-year prison sentence, though, according to her, she was set up and was only holding the marijuana for a friend.\n\nWhile the marijuana case devolved into a lengthy series of appeals, her fame spread nationwide and Barr became the toast of the strip club runways, reportedly earning $2,000 a week in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, as well as at the Sho-Bar Club on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans.\n\nWhile stripping at the Largo Club on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, she met gangster Mickey Cohen and became his girl. According to Cohen in his autobiography, \"In My Own Words\", he helped her make bail after Gary Crosby told him, \"One thing about that broad, she can make ya feel like a real man.\" Barr accompanied Cohen to the Saints and Sinners testimonial for Milton Berle in April 1959.\n\nThe mobster, who insisted he wanted to marry her, eventually sent her and her four-year-old daughter to Mexico so she could evade arrest. He arranged for her hair to be dyed by \"hairdresser to the stars\" Jack Sahakian, provided her with a fake birth certificate and Social Security card, and gave her $1,200 cash. He later sent her $500 after she was established in a Mexican hideaway. She became restless there, however, and returned to the United States. During this time, her interest in Cohen foundered.\n\nAlso in 1959, she was hired by 20th Century Fox Studios as a choreographer for \"Seven Thieves\" (1960). She taught actress Joan Collins how to \"dance\" for her role as a stripper and was given a credit as technical advisor. Barr was quoted as saying, \"Anytime Miss Collins wants to leave the movies, she has it made in burlesque.\" In the first of her two autobiographical books, \"Past Imperfect\", Collins describe Barr as \"a down-to-earth girl with an incredibly gorgeous body and an angelic face\" [who had] \"taught me more about sensuality than I had learned in all my years under contract\".\n\nBarr won another chance at reversing her 15-year sentence that October when the district attorney in Dallas said the U.S. Supreme Court had informed his office that her lawyers would be given 20 days to file a motion for a rehearing.\n\nShe and hairdresser Jack Sahakian were married on November 25, 1959 in Las Vegas while she was headlining at the El Rancho Vegas Hotel. Days later, despite rumors that her arrest had been a setup designed to punish the stripper for her wantonness in conservative Dallas, Barr was arrested by the FBI when the United States Supreme Court denied and rejected her appeal of the marijuana conviction.\n\nOn December 4, 1959, Barr reportedly left her daughter with her third husband, Sahakian, and entered the Goree State Farm for women near Huntsville, Texas. During her imprisonment, she was a witness in Los Angeles in mid-1961 in the tax evasion trial of her former boyfriend Mickey Cohen. She testified that he paid $15,000 to her attorneys and lavished gifts on her during their brief engagement in 1959. She said that among the other gifts she received from him were jewelry, luggage, and a poodle. It was her understanding, she said, that Cohen was to settle a clothing bill of hers for $1,001.95.\n\nAfter serving over three years of her fifteen-year sentence, Barr was paroled from Goree women's unit on April 1, 1963. She left the prison without any fanfare or publicity, having requested that no pictures be taken and no interviews arranged. Barr had intended to return to Dallas, but her parole stipulations were so strict that it was not permitted. Instead, she returned to her hometown of Edna, where her father and stepmother still lived. At this time, she became closer to Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in telephone conversations. As she was having health problems when she was released from prison, she decided the best way to earn a living was by raising animals for profit. Ruby went down to Edna and gave her a pair of dachshund breeding dogs from his prized litter to get her started.\n\nTwelve hours after Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald, the leading suspect in the assassination of President John Kennedy, live on national television, the FBI arrived in Edna to interview Barr. She made a statement, as Juanita Dale Phillips, regarding her knowledge of Ruby prior to Oswald being accused of the assassination of Kennedy, and Ruby's subsequent murder of Oswald. It was rumored that she knew more than she disclosed, but she later said, \"They thought Ruby had told me names and places and people, which he didn't.\"\n\nTexas Governor John Connally pardoned her for the marijuana conviction in 1968. Barr said, \"I really don't know why, unless he studied the case and knew it was an injustice whether I was a victim or not.\"\n\nBarr returned to the stripping circuit in early 1966, including appearances at the Largo Club in Los Angeles and the Bonanza Hotel in Las Vegas. She also returned to the Colony Club in Dallas. She then moved to Brownwood, Texas, as her father was ill in Kerrville. She was arrested and charged with marijuana possession again in 1969 in Brownwood. Barr later said, \"While my father was in the process of dying, they decided to take advantage of my situation there and busted me. I knew the marijuana wasn't there, I hadn't had any around me for three years.\" The district attorney in Brown County eventually dismissed the case against her for lack of evidence.\n\nIn 1972, 56 poems that she wrote while in prison were published with the title \"A Gentle Mind...Confused.\" The 41-year-old grandmother was featured in the June 1976 issue of \"Oui Magazine\". She gave an interview in \"Playboy\" soon afterward. During this period, she had a casual sexual encounter with Hugh Hefner, who subsequently characterized their liaison in a 1984 interview as \"a sort of Sex King and Queen kind of thing... [s]he was wonderful.\" The film rights to Barr's early life story were purchased by producer Mardi Rustam in 1982. In 1984, \"Texas Monthly\" listed Barr alongside other Texans like Lady Bird Johnson as one of history's \"perfect Texans.\"\n\nIn March 1988, it was announced that Ryan O'Neal would direct Farrah Fawcett in a biographical film about Barr based on a script by George Axelrod, who wrote the Broadway play \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" However, the biopic was never produced.\n\nIn 1992, Barr moved from Brownwood back to Edna. Living in quiet retirement with her animals at her rural home, she was content not to exploit or relive her past. She said she was never interested in arousing men, she just wanted to dance. On December 30, 2005, Barr died, at the age of 70, from complications from pneumonia at a hospital in Victoria, Texas.\n\nCandy Barr is among the inductees in the Hall of Fame of Exotic World Burlesque Museum, formerly located in Helendale, California, and now on Main Street in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her lip prints are part of the museum's display.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2020117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020117", "title": "The Wild Geese", "text": "The Wild Geese\n\nThe Wild Geese is a 1978 British-Swiss war film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen and starring Richard Burton, Roger Moore, Richard Harris, and Hardy Krüger. The screenplay concerns a group of mercenaries in Africa. It was the result of a long-held ambition of its producer Euan Lloyd to make an all-star adventure film similar to \"The Guns of Navarone\" or \"Where Eagles Dare\". The same producer and director were later responsible for \"The Sea Wolves\".\n\nThe screenplay by Reginald Rose was based on an unpublished novel titled \"The Thin White Line\" by Daniel Carney. The film was named \"The Wild Geese\" after the Wild Goose flag and shoulder patch used by Michael \"Mad Mike\" Hoare's Five Commando, ANC, which in turn was inspired by a 17th-century Irish mercenary army (see Flight of the Wild Geese). Carney's novel was subsequently published by Corgi Books under the same title as the film.\n\nThe novel was based upon rumours and speculation following the 1968 landing of a mysterious aeroplane in Rhodesia, which was said to have been loaded with mercenaries and \"an African president\" believed to have been a dying Moïse Tshombe.\n\nAllen Faulkner, a former British Army colonel turned mercenary, arrives in London to meet merchant banker Sir Edward Matheson. The latter proposes an operation to rescue Julius Limbani, the imprisoned President of a southern African nation who is due for execution by General Ndofa. President Limbani is held in a remote prison in Zembala, guarded by a regiment of General Ndofa's troops known as the \"Simbas\".\n\nFaulkner accepts the assignment and begins recruiting forty-nine mercenaries, including officers he had worked with previously: Capt. Rafer Janders, a skilled tactician, and Lt. Shawn Fynn, a former Irish Guards officer and pilot. Fynn also brings in Pieter Coetzee, a former soldier in the South African Defence Force who wishes only to return home and buy a farm. The mercenaries fly to Swaziland, where they are whipped into shape. Before the operation begins, Janders exacts a promise from Faulkner to watch over his only son, Emile, should he not survive.\n\nBecause of an unexpected development, Faulkner is given only a day's notice to launch the mission. On Christmas Day, the 50-man mercenary group parachute into Zembala via HALO jump. One group rescues an alive, though sick, Limbani from a heavily guarded prison, while another group takes over a small, nearby airfield to await pickup. Back in London, however, Matheson cancels the extraction flight at the last moment, having secured copper mining assets from General Ndofa in exchange for President Limbani. Stranded deep in hostile territory, the abandoned mercenaries fight their way through bush country, pursued by the Simbas. Many men, including Coetzee, are killed along the way.\n\nThe mercenaries make their way to Limbani's home village, hoping to start a rebellion, but discover his people are too ill-equipped to fight. An Irish missionary living there informs the group of an old Douglas Dakota transport aircraft nearby that they can use to escape. As the Simbas close in, the mercenaries hold them off in a climactic battle sequence while Fynn starts the Dakota's engines, suffering heavy casualties. Janders is shot in the leg and unable to board the departing airplane. Faulkner is forced to kill him, sparing him from capture and torture. The thirteen surviving mercenaries finally manage to land at Kariba Airport, Rhodesia, but Limbani dies from a gunshot wound sustained during the escape.\n\nSome months later, Faulkner returns to London and breaks into Matheson's home, forcing him to disgorge the cash in his wall safe—half a million dollars—to compensate the survivors and the families of those who died. Faulkner then kills Matheson and makes a swift getaway with Fynn. Faulkner fulfills his promise to Janders by visiting Emile at his boarding school.\n\nThe film was based on a novel, \"The Thin White Line\", which Euan Lloyd read prior to publication. He optioned it and hired Reginald Rose to write the screenplay in June 1976. The budget was US$9 million.\n\nUnited Artists was enthusiastic about the film, but insisted Lloyd give the director's job to Michael Winner. Lloyd refused and instead chose Andrew V. McLaglen, son of Victor McLaglen, a British-born American previously known mainly for making westerns. Euan Lloyd had a friendship with John Ford who recommended McLaglen to direct the film. The finance for the film was raised partly by pre-selling it to distributors based on the script and the names of the stars who were set to appear. This later became a more common practice in the film industry, but was unusual at the time.\n\nAlthough Lloyd had both Richard Burton and Roger Moore in mind for their respective roles from a relatively early stage, other casting decisions were more difficult. As the mercenaries were mostly composed of military veterans (some of whom had fought under Faulkner's command before), it was necessary to cast a number of older actors and extras into these physically demanding roles. A number of veterans and actual mercenary soldiers appeared in the film.\n\nNorthern Irish actor Stephen Boyd, a close friend of Lloyd's, was originally set to star as Sandy Young, the sergeant major who trains the mercenaries before their mission. However, Boyd died shortly before filming commenced and Jack Watson was chosen as a late replacement. He had previously played a similar role in McLaglen's 1968 film \"The Devil's Brigade\".\n\nLloyd had offered the part of the banker Matheson to his friend Joseph Cotten. However, scheduling difficulties meant that he also had to be replaced, this time by Stewart Granger.\n\nBurt Lancaster originally hoped to play the part of Rafer Janders who in Carney's book was an American living in London. However, Lancaster wanted the part substantially altered and enlarged. The producers declined and in his place chose Richard Harris. Lloyd initially had reservations about casting Harris because of his wild reputation - he was blamed for \"Golden Rendezvous\" going over budget by $1.5 million due to his drinking and rewriting the script. The insurers only agreed to Harris' casting if Lloyd put up his entire salary as guarantee, Harris put up half of his $600,000 fee, and that the producer would sign a declaration at the end of every day saying Harris had not held up filming due to drinking, misbehaving or rewriting lines. \"I'd already made enquiries about the hold ups on \"Golden Rendesvous\",\" said Lloyd. \"I discovered the blame was not entirely Richard's. So, as I wanted him for the part, I took the gamble. And it was a gamble. If he'd misbehaved and he'd started losing days it would have come out of my pocket.\" Harris did not know about the arrangement until the end of the shoot.\n\nHardy Krüger was not the first actor considered for the role of Pieter Coetzee. Lloyd originally thought of Curd Jürgens, but felt that \"Hardy seemed to fit.\" Krüger was also impressed by the script scenes played with Limbani.\n\n\"I was the only wild member of the cast,\" quipped Moore later. \"Harris and Burton were on the wagon and Krüger never emerged from his room with his lady.\" Moore's character was nearly offered to O.J. Simpson after confusion on the American financier's part regarding the character being described as black Irish.\n\nLloyd hesitated before offering the role of Witty, the gay medic, to his longtime friend Kenneth Griffith. When finally approached, Griffith said \"Some of my dearest friends in the world are homosexuals!\" and accepted the part.\n\nPercy Herbert, who played the role of Keith, was a veteran of World War II, in which he had been wounded in the defence of Singapore, then captured by the Imperial Japanese Army and interned in a POW camp.\n\nAlan Ladd's son David Ladd and Stanley Baker's son Glyn Baker also had roles in the film. Ladd played the drug-dealing nephew of a London-based mob boss (Jeff Corey), and Baker played the young mercenary Esposito. With the cast made up from so many veteran actors, Baker claimed that the only reason he stayed alive in the plot so long was that he was one of the few actors young and fit enough to carry President Limbani for any period of time. David Ladd's character's girlfriend in the film was played by Anna Bergman, the daughter of Ingmar Bergman,\n\nIan Yule, who played Tosh Donaldson, had been a real mercenary in Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. He was cast locally in South Africa. He then brought his former commanding officer, Michael \"Mad Mike\" Hoare, who had led one legion of mercenaries, 5 Commando, Armée Nationale Congolaise (not to be confused with 5 Commando, the Second World War British Commando force), in the Congo Crisis of the 1960s, to be the technical adviser for the film. a role which he shared with Yule.\n\nJohn Kani played Jesse Blake, a mercenary who had previously served with Faulkner and was struggling to live before the chance to work with Faulkner again. Palitoy based the figure \"Tom Stone\" (part of the Action Man team) on the character Blake after looking at the pre-production photos and posters of the film. Subsequently, some modifications to the figure were made. Kani made his debut in the film after years of acting and stage performances with Winston Ntshona. Ntshona was Limbani in the film and continued to make many more films with Kani after \"The Wild Geese\".\n\nKani and Ntshona say they both turned down roles in the film at first after hearing it would be about mercenaries. However they changed their mind after reading the script. \"The film could not come at a better time,\" said Kani. \"We know exactly what is happening in Africa today and a movie that devotes - out of 120 minutes - even three quarters of a minute to say we need each other and to say that a white man can be just as much an African as a black man, that's important.\"\n\nRosalind Lloyd, who played Heather, is Euan Lloyd's daughter. Her mother, actress Jane Hylton, played Mrs Young.\n\nPrincipal filming took place in South Africa in the summer and autumn of 1977, with additional studio filming at Twickenham Film Studios in Middlesex. Roger Moore estimated location filming in Africa took about three months with the unit taking over a health spa near Tshipisie in Northern Transvaal (now Limpopo); shooting also took place at Messina Border Region. The fictional country is said to lie on the border with Burundi, Rhodesia and Rwanda and Zambia, Uganda and Swaziland are also mentioned to be close by.\n\nThe rugby scenes were filmed over a period of two days at Marble Hill Park in Twickenham with extras drafted in from nearby Teddington Boys' School. Marble Hill Close near Marble Hill Park was also used as a location.\n\nHardy Krüger later complained about the film:\nFor this kind of a delicate story in Africa with an element of battle in it, there has to be some shoot-out. But Euan Lloyd, a man I respect very much, chose to hire Andrew McLaglen who’s basically a director for westerns. He brought this element into \"The Wild Geese\" that didn’t really belong there – the shoot ‘em up cowboy kind of thing. It overwhelmed the basic theme. There are certain directors, and Andrew is one, who, when it comes to the editing, always puts a moment in the film when somebody talks. I’m a listener as an actor – a reactor – and it was very important to me to listen. I played the whole part like that: I’m listening to this black man on my shoulder, and it’s by listening that I’m beginning to understand that I’m the dumb Boer and he’s the intelligent man that we all need. So Andrew butchered my performance by not understanding that you can play a part by listening. My character didn’t come out because you didn’t see the transformation. I don’t know why Euan allowed him to do it. \nMost of the military equipment used in the film came from the South African army. However some special weaponry needed to be imported from Britain. \"Even though the stuff couldn't fire real bullets, it was held up for weeks by the British government because it was going to South Africa,\" said Lloyd.\n\nThe music, by Roy Budd, originally included an overture and end title music, but both of these were replaced by \"Flight of the Wild Geese\", written and performed by Joan Armatrading. All three pieces are included on the soundtrack album, as well as the song \"Dogs of War\" that featured lyrics sung by the Scots Guards to Budd's themes. Budd used Borodin's String Quartet No. 2 as a theme for Rafer. The soundtrack was originally released by A&M Records then later released under licence as a Cinephile DVD.\n\n\"The Wild Geese\" enjoyed a Royal premiere with most of the stars of the film present, alongside other luminaries such as John Mills. The premiere was in support of Scope. \nThe film was a considerable commercial success in Britain and other countries worldwide, easily recouping its cost, but was hampered by the collapse of its American distributor Allied Artists, and by the lack of an American star. As a result, the film was only partially distributed in the United States.\n\nIt was one of the most popular movies of 1978 at the British box office.\n\nThe production was also the subject of controversy because filming was undertaken in South Africa during the apartheid regime, and because of the film's portrayal of black characters. There were protests by anti-apartheid campaigners at the film's London premiere. Warned of the protest, producer Lloyd brought copies of newspaper articles reporting the film's premiere in the black township of Soweto, where it had been received with enthusiasm and approval.\n\nThe film was picketed in Irish cinemas by the Irish anti-apartheid movement.\n\n\"The Wild Geese\" holds a 60% \"fresh\" rating in Rotten Tomatoes and also won a Golden Screen Award. As for the negative side of its reviews, it was chosen as \"Dog of the Year\" by film critic Gene Siskel, who accused the film of being \"deadly dull\" and claimed that it \"exploits racism as some kind of sporting entertainment\".\n\nEuan Lloyd produced a sequel, \"Wild Geese II\" (1985), based on the novel \"Square Circle\" (later republished as \"Wild Geese II\"), also by Daniel Carney. Burton was planning to reprise his role as Colonel Allen Faulkner, but he died days before filming began. Roger Moore had also considered reprising his role in the sequel, but declined. In the sequel, Edward Fox played Alex Faulkner (the Burton character's brother), who is hired to break Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess (played by Laurence Olivier) out of Spandau Prison so he can appear for a media interview.\n\n\n"}

Because of its location this stadium has hosted two World Cups (1970 and 1986). The stadium sits at an altitude of roughly above sea level, one of the highest altitude stadiums in North America. A former nuance about this stadium is that it did not have a lighting system, which forced the local team as a tradition to play at noon. \n\nThe stadium was previously known as: Estadio Toluca 70-86, Estadio Toluca 70, Estadio Luis Gutiérrez Dosal and Estadio Héctor Barraza.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Toluca played its home games at a ground near downtown Toluca known then as Tivoli.

On that same spot, in 1953, the club started building its own stadium.\n\nThe stadium was inaugurated on Sunday 8 August 1954, with a match between Toluca and Yugoslavian team Dinamo Zagreb. The game was won by Dinamo 4–1. The only goal for Toluca and also the first in the history of the stadium was scored by Enrique Sesma. \n\nInitially, the stadium was opened as Estadio Club Deportivo Toluca. That name lasted until 1955, when it was changed to Estadio Héctor Barraza. Other names the stadium has had are: Estadio Luis Gutiérrez Dosal (1959–1970), Estadio Toluca 70 (1970–1986), Estadio Toluca 70–86 (1986–2000). \n\nAfter the death of Nemesio Díez, president and then owner of the club, in June 2000, the stadium name was changed to Estadio Nemesio Díez.\n\nWith an investment of 800 million MXN (about 40 million USD), the announcement to remodel The Nemesio Diez stadium by 2017 was made, when Club Deportivo Toluca celebrates its centenary and does so with a remodeled and more functional stadium.\n\nWithin the Nemesio Diez, four macro support columns that will sustain the stadium structure will be built to replace the current columns obstructing visibility. In the shadow stands, a second level will be built so the capacity, which currently stands at 22,000 will increase to 30,000.\n\nThe project also includes four giant screens at each end of the building, replacement of all seats and a sunroof in the preferred (shaded) section, to assist in the process of maintaining the natural grass in the field.\n\nThe remodeled stadium officially opened on January 15, 2017 with a league match against Club America. The first goal was scored by Gabriel Hauche for Toluca with a screamer outside of the box. Toluca FC won that match 2-1.\n\nThe stadium was completed in the summer 2017 where it had been confirmed that the club would play against Atlético Madrid for the official inauguration of the remodeled stadium.\n\nRunner-up of the public vote \"Stadium of the Year 2017\" – Stadium DB.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020120", "title": "Haim Arlosoroff", "text": "Haim Arlosoroff\n\nHaim Arlosoroff (February 23, 1899 – June 16, 1933; also known as Chaim Arlozorov; ) was a Zionist leader of the Yishuv during the British Mandate for Palestine, prior to the establishment of Israel, and head of the Political Department of the Jewish Agency. In 1933, Arlosoroff was assassinated while walking on the beach in Tel Aviv.\n\nHaim Arlosoroff was born in Romny, Russian Empire on February 23, 1899. In Russia, he was known as Vitaly, the Russian equivalent of Haim. When living in Germany, he was known as Viktor. Arlosoroff's paternal grandfather was Rabbi Eliezer Arlosoroff of Romny, an author of religious commentaries on the Talmud. At the age of six, Arlosoroff encountered antisemitism for the first time. In 1905, the Arlosoroff family home in Romny was attacked during a violent pogrom. The family fled across the German border to East Prussia. Seven years later the family settled in Königsberg, Germany (now the Russian city of Kaliningrad). Arlosoroff thus became fluent in German, in addition to studying Hebrew with a tutor. When World War I began in 1914, the family did not have German citizenship and were threatened with deportation. The family eventually obtained permission to move to Berlin. When his father, Saul, returned to Russia on business, he was barred from returning and died there of cholera. Arlosoroff studied economics at the University of Berlin and obtained a doctorate in that subject. During his studies, he wrote articles on Zionist affairs. In Germany, he became a key leader of \"Hapoel Hatzair\" (also Ha-Po'el ha-Tza'ir, Hebrew for \"The Young Worker\"), a socialist political party which attracted many of the intellectuals of the time. As a result of his party affiliation, Arlosoroff was appointed editor of \"Die Arbeit\" (German for \"The Labour\"), a journal in which his writings were first published.\n\nThough Arlosoroff was not observant, both his precociousness and his strong feelings as a Jew can be seen in a letter he wrote at age 17 to his German literature teacher: \"I am a Jew, and I feel strong and proud of my Jewishness. I feel it in my bones that I am different from a German, and it would never occur to me to deny this…. My soul yearns for the unique, ancient Hebrew culture. But I also like German culture, and perhaps I am also afraid to admit how great my love for it is…Yet, Goethe and Schiller never really touched my heart closely.\" In 1919, Arlosoroff published the treatise \"Jewish People's Socialism\", his first major written contribution relating to a nationalistic hope for the Jewish people in Eretz Israel. In his treatise, Arlosoroff distanced himself from traditional Marxist beliefs by advocating a new brand of socialism that embraced a national consciousness. Arlosoroff's contention was that the Jewish people would only be able to preserve and revive their unique cultural identities within a Jewish national homeland. Arlosoroff further professed, that through the establishment of \"Jewish People's Socialism\", Jews would be guaranteed public land ownership upon their return to Eretz Israel. In accord with the visions of other socialist Zionists of his time, Arlosoroff believed that ancient Biblical agricultural traditions, such as the \"Sabbath Year\" and \"Year of Jubilee\", could be restored in modern practice alongside institutional parameters established for the new Jewish nation. Arlosoroff's treatise accurately predicted a powerful resurgence of the Hebrew language would accompany the return of Jewish people to Eretz Israel.\n\nArlosoroff first visited the Holy Land in the spring of 1921. Shortly after his arrival, the Jaffa riots broke out. In the midst of Arab rioting, Arlosoroff stood in defense of Neve Shalom, a Jewish settlement adjacent to Tel Aviv and Jaffa. These events helped draw Arlosoroff's focus to the need for better relations between Jews and Arabs. Following the riots, Arlosoroff called upon the Zionist establishment to no longer deny the reality of an Arab national movement existing in Eretz Israel. However, Arlosoroff's plea was not widely accepted, and he received criticism from within the ranks of his own party, Hapoel Hatzair. Arlosoroff would ultimately come to the position that strength-based compromise with neighboring Arabs would not weaken or undermine efforts to establish a Jewish national homeland.\n\nIn the 1923 Zionist Congress, Arlosoroff was elected to the Zionist Action Committee. He was only 24 years old at the time. Turning down a university position, he left Germany for the British Mandate of Palestine in 1924. In 1926 he was chosen to represent the yishuv at the League of Nations in Geneva.\n\nArlosoroff's hope for peaceful cooperation and compromise with Arabs would be severely tested. In 1929, the consciously aggressive Betar Youth Movement, organized under Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Union of Revisionist Zionists, took part in a coalition to assertively enforce and enlarge a Jewish presence in the proximity of the Western Wall. The activities of Betar and their associates inflamed an explosive reaction from the Arab community, in whose perception these activities had dishonoured the Muslim holy site on the adjacent Temple Mount. The violent Western Wall Uprisings of 1929 ensued, which resulted in the loss of many lives, including civilians. Instead of inciting further Arab tensions, Arlosoroff strongly criticized the Revisionists for insensitively provoking the animosity.\n\nIn 1930, Arlosoroff was influential in unifying the two major Zionist socialist political parties, the Poale Zion and the Hapoel Hatzair. This merger brought the establishment of the Mapai Labour Party. Through the Mapai's political muscle, Arlosoroff received election as a member of the Zionist Executive at the 1931 Zionist Congress. In addition, he was named Political Director of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, a prominent position he filled until his 1933 assassination.\n\nAs the Jewish Agency's Political Director, Arlosoroff first believed that the British would help settling Jews in Palestine, so he worked with the British mandatory government which was in charge of running that territory. Prior to his tenure as Political Director, Arlosoroff had already familiarized himself with the British system of rule, having written an essay titled \"The British Administration and the Jewish National Home\". During his years in office, Arlosoroff would develop close working relationships with Britain's High Commissioner Arthur Wauchope and British Colonial Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister.\n\nArlosoroff was a close friend of the Jewish scientist and statesman, Chaim Weizmann. Dr. Weizmann was considered to be among the most politically moderate of Arlosoroff's Mapai Zionist contemporaries.\n\nIn the months leading up to his assassination, Arlosoroff's fervor to help establish a Jewish national homeland intensified. At a Mapai Labour Council meeting occurring in January 1933, Arlosoroff strongly clashed with David Ben-Gurion and other prominent Mapai leaders regarding whether or not the Zionists should work within the British government's infrastructure to help bring about Jewish statehood. Arlosoroff warned his colleagues that if the Zionist movement maintained an isolationist policy with the British ruling authorities, Arab political influence would increase within the British Administration and cause the rights of Jewish people in Eretz Israel to suffer.\n\nOn April 8, 1933, Arlosoroff organized a historic event at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on the Jewish Agency's behalf. The luncheon, attended by Weizmann and prominent Arab leaders of Transjordan, would be the first time Jewish Zionists and key Arabs gathered together to help promote cooperative efforts between the two groups. Arlosoroff hoped that by building an accord with the Arab sheiks of Transjordan, political relations with Arab leaders of Mandatory Palestine might be enhanced. However, not everyone was pleased with Arlosoroff's vision for Jewish/Arab collaboration, nor the possibility of a bi-nationalistic future in Eretz Israel. After the luncheon, Arab radicals openly chastised the moderate Arabs who had attended the meeting. Certain Arab leaders in Mandatory Palestine distanced themselves completely from the Transjordanian Arab delegation. Particular anger was directed at Transjordan's Emir Abdullah, the ruler over large territories in Transjordan, who had taken a leading role in the conciliation efforts. Jewish opposition to the King David Hotel meeting also became apparent as the major party of religious Zionism, Mizrachi, demanded that Arlosoroff should resign from his position at the Jewish Agency. Some radicals in the Revisionist movement went even further and questioned Arlosoroff's right to be alive.\n\nAs a result of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Arlosoroff directed his focus to the plight of German Jews. The Germany Arlosoroff loved growing up changed quickly and drastically upon Hitler's rise to power. In April 1933, the new regime implemented the first of many anti-Jewish laws by terminating all Jewish employees from German government positions. Also at that time, Nazi officials decreed Jewish people would not be permitted to leave the country without a specially issued exit visa. Jewish groups responded worldwide to Hitler's regime through protests and boycotts of German products.\nImmediately following an organized Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany on April 1, 1933, Arlosoroff contacted High Commissioner Arthur Wauchope requesting Britain's intervention in the crisis. Arlosoroff asked Wauchope to consider that supplementary immigration visas for Mandatory Palestine be granted to Jewish people seeking refuge from Hitler's Reich.\n\nThough Hitler hated Jewish people and wanted them expelled from Germany, in 1933 the Nazis were not willing to let a large number of Jewish refugees flee to the surrounding nations. This was because Reich officials were concerned that fleeing Jewish refugees would lend large numbers to a growing international movement for the economic boycott of Nazi Germany. Adding to Hitler's worries, German financial advisers warned the Nazi government that a mass exodus of Jewish laborers from the German workforce would badly damage Germany's economic stability. The Nazis needed a convenient solution to rid themselves of Jews without a political or economic backlash.\n\nIn 1933, Arlosoroff and German Reich officials viewed the British Mandate of Palestine as a land of opportunity for very different reasons. In the eyes of the Nazi leadership, the remote British-controlled territory appeared to be a \"dumping-ground\" suitable to isolate thousands of anti-Hitler Jewish refugees from the world's political arena. In addition, a financial agreement with Zionist leaders for the transfer of the refugees would help bolster a German economy adversely affected by anti-Nazi boycotts. For Arlosoroff and other Zionists, however, the potential mass transfer of Germany's Jews along with their assets to Eretz Israel presented a historic opportunity to help guarantee the future establishment of a Jewish nation in Mandatory Palestine.\n\nArlosoroff came to feel that the British could not be trusted and that the Jews must risk angering them in order to rebuild their own homeland and save the Jews of Europe from the nationalist and authoritarian regimes under which they lived, especially in Nazi Germany.\n\nIn his efforts to help Jews escape the tyranny of Hitler, Arlosoroff would face staunch opposition from the Revisionist ranks within his own Zionist movement. Though Mapai Labour leaders attempted to prepare the way for an agreement with Germany by mitigating anti-Nazi sentiment within Zionist circles, prominent Revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky steadfastly opposed them. In a radio broadcast on April 28, 1933, Jabotinsky strongly condemned any possible pact between Zionism and Hitler. Jabotinsky upheld in his radio address the Revisionist platform for an international economic boycott on German exports, suggesting in addition that the British Mandate of Palestine should assume the lead in the boycott efforts.\n\nAt this point, Haim Arlosoroff visited Nazi Germany to negotiate the controversial Ha'avara Agreement. It allowed for the emigration of Jews to Palestine along with most of their property. The Germans were happy to get rid of Jews but unwilling to allow them to take their property with them. Via the agreement, the Jews had to put their money into a special bank account. This money was then used to purchase German goods for export to Palestine (and other countries). The proceeds of the sale of these goods were given to the Jews on their arrival in Palestine. For the Nazis, this helped them get rid of Jews but overcame any attempts at a boycott of German exports (especially from a moral point of view since it was the Jews themselves importing the goods). For the Zionist settlement, the influx of capital gave a much-needed economic boom in the midst of worldwide depression.\n\nApproximately a year after Arlosoroff and German officials formalized the Ha'avara Agreement, a substantial economic reaction began to take place in Eretz Israel. As a result, many new Jewish immigrants came to dwell in the Holy Land. Prior to the Ha'avara Agreement, only several thousand Jewish workers had been immigrating to the British Mandate of Palestine on a yearly basis. After the agreement was signed, however, over 50,000 new Jewish workers made the British Mandate of Palestine their home within two years. The Ha'avara Agreement's initial impact on Jewish immigration would be widespread, as an approximate 20% of the first 50,000 new Jewish immigrants in Eretz Israel came from Germany. By 1936, just three years after the Ha'avara Agreement became effective, the population of Jewish people within the British Mandate of Palestine had doubled in size.\n\nOver a period of time, some of Hitler's elite Nazi entourage, including Adolf Eichmann, began to deeply regret Germany's participation in the Ha'avara Agreement.\n\nUltimately, over 60,000 German Jews escaped persecution by the Nazis directly or indirectly through the Ha'avara Agreement. In addition, the Ha'avara Agreement transferred an approximate $100 million to the British Mandate of Palestine, which helped establish an industrial infrastructure for the soon to be Jewish nation. Ha'avara Agreement funds were also used for the purchase of land and the development of many new Jewish settlements that now help define the current boundaries of Israel.\n\nOn 16 June 1933, just two days after his return from negotiations in Germany, Haim Arlosoroff was murdered. He was killed while walking with his wife Sima on a beach in Tel Aviv. Arlosoroff's funeral was the largest in the history of the British Mandate of Palestine, with an estimated assemblage of 70,000 to 100,000 mourners. The death of Arlosoroff greatly aggravated political relations within the Zionist movement.\n\nAbba Ahimeir, the head of an activist group with fascist tendencies, the Brit HaBirionim, was charged by the Palestine Police Force with plotting the assassination. Ahimeir was also a leader of the nationalist Zionist Revisionist faction whose publication, \"Hazit HaAm\" continuously attacked the Labor movement and Zionist leaders, including Arlosoroff, calling him names and stating that the Jewish people \"will know how to react to such villains\". Two rank-and-file Revisionists, Abraham Stavsky and Ze'evi Rosenblatt, were arrested as the actual murderers and were identified by Arlosoroff's widow. All three vehemently denied the accusation.\n\nThe district court acquitted Ahimeir and Rosenblatt but convicted Stavsky, who, however, was eventually acquitted by the Supreme Court for lack of corroborating evidence, as the law then required. The defense accused the police of manipulating the widow's testimony and other evidence for political reasons, and expounded the theory that the murder was connected to an intended sexual attack on Sima Arlosoroff by two young Arabs. Stavsky later rose within Irgun ranks and was responsible for the procurement of the Irgun arms vessel known as the \"Altalena.\" He was killed in the attack on the ship by the newly established Israel Defense Forces on the Beach of Tel Aviv.\nIn addition to the theories that people connected to the revisionist movement were the perpetrators of the murder, or that it was an intended sexual attack by two Arabs, there are theories connecting it to the Soviet and Nazi regimes. One involves Goebbels, who supposedly sent two agents, Theo Korth and Heinz Geronda, to murder Arlosoroff. During her school days, Magda Ritschel, who later became the wife of Joseph Goebbels, met and became close friends with Lisa Arlosoroff, Haim Arlosoroff's sister. Magda met Haim at university; they became lovers and she got involved with him in Zionist affairs. According to Lisa's diary, Magda fervently participated in the debates of the group \"Tikwath Zion\" on the future of Palestine and learnt Hebrew. She wore a necklace with the Star of David that he gave her as a love token, and they even planned to emigrate to Palestine together. However, the relationship ended with the departure of Haim, whom Magda did not want to follow. In 1921 Magda married Günther Quandt, a rich German industrialist twice her age. In 1929 Günther discovered that Magda was having an affair, so he separated from her. He went on to divorce Magda that same year, but was generous with the divorce settlement. The affair Magda was having was with her old boyfriend Haim, who had returned to Germany. In 1930 Magda also began to date Joseph Goebbels. When Haim discovered Magda was romantically involved with a senior Nazi Party member, he flew into a rage, pulled out a gun and fired at Magda. The bullet did not hit her, and Magda permanently broke off her relationship with Haim, despite his pleas and apologies. Magda later married Goebbels on 19 December 1931, with Adolf Hitler as his best man. When Haim visited Berlin, he discovered his old flame arm-in-arm with Goebbels. He even came across an opposition newspaper with the headline ‘Nazi Chief weds Jewess’. Once the shock had subsided, Arlosoroff, so the theory went, began to view Magda as his conduit to Goebbels to secure the Ha'avarah agreement. Their old relationship proved to be an embarrassment to Goebbels and Magda, who were now very much part of the Nazi leadership. Goebbels took notice of his wife's former Jewish boyfriend, and this was why he was “terminated.” Magda's former Jewish stepfather, Richard Friedländer, was later arrested on Goebbels' orders on June 15, 1938 and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he died on February 18, 1939. The Soviet connection was promoted by Shmuel Dothan in 1991 to counter what the Russians considered as a global military plot against them.\n\nFor years figures belonging to the right-wing claimed to be wrongfully accused by Mapai of being responsible for Arlosoroff's death. About fifty years after the murder, following the publication of a book on the assassination by Shabtai Teveth in 1982, the Israeli government, now led by Menachem Begin, established a formal investigative committee. As the first Israeli Prime Minister elected from the Revisionist movement, Begin had taken offense at a suggestion in Teveth's book that a Revisionist acquitted in court for Arlosoroff's murder may have actually been responsible after all. The Judicial Commission of Enquiry was led by the former High court of Justice Judge David Bachor. Its purpose was to decide whether Rosenblatt and Stavsky were responsible for assassinating Arlosoroff, or not. The committee decided unanimously that Rosenblatt and Stavsky had nothing to do with the murder. The committee was inconclusive about the identity of the real murderers or whether or not the murder was politically motivated.\n\nArlosoroff is buried at the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv. Arlosoroff's memory is honored today by the many streets named after him throughout the towns of Israel and in the names of several places in Israel: Kiryat Haim, a large neighborhood of Haifa, Giv'at Haim, a kibutz and Kfar Haim, a moshav.\n\nAn 8-foot tall bronze monument dedicated to the legacy of Dr. Chaim Arlosoroff has been erected at the Tel Aviv shoreline promenade where he was fatally wounded.\n\nThe name of Haim Arlosoroff was also used for a ship carrying Jewish refugees to Palestine, the former USCGC \"Unalga\" (WPG-53). On 27 February 1947, the \"Haim Arlosoroff\" (1,378 passengers from Sweden and Italy) was intercepted by Royal Navy destroyer HMS \"Chieftain\", and the passengers put up fierce resistance. The ship ran aground at Bat Galim south of Haifa, just opposite a British Army camp. The crew and passengers were arrested and deported to Cyprus.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020123", "title": "Freddy Maertens", "text": "Freddy Maertens\n\nFreddy Maertens (born 13 February 1952 in Nieuwpoort) is a Belgian former professional racing cyclist who was twice world road race champion. His career coincided with the best years of another Belgian rider, Eddy Merckx, and supporters and reporters were split over which was the better. Maertens' career swung between winning more than 50 races in a season to winning almost none and then back again. His life has been marked by debt and alcoholism. It took him more than two decades to pay a tax debt.\n\nMaertens was the son of what his wife, Carine, described as a hard-working middle-class couple: Gilbert Maertens and Silonne Verhaege. His mother was the daughter of a shipbuilder in Nieuwpoort harbour. She had a grocery and newspaper shop, which delivered newspapers. Gilbert Maertens, the son of a self-employed bill-sticker, was a flamboyant and restless man who was a member of the local council and on the committee of the town football club. He ran a laundry with a staff of four behind his wife's shop.\n\nMaertens is one of four brothers: he, Mario, Luc and Marc. Marc also rode as a professional. Maertens went to the St-Bernadus college in Nieuwpoort. He read enthusiastically and showed a talent for languages. He could make himself understood in French, Italian and English as well as his native Dutch by the time he turned professional. He then went to the Onze Lieve Vrouw [Holy Mother] college in Ostend.\n\nMaertens and Carine Brouckaert met at a cycling club dance when she was 15. She had been sewing shoes for her father, a cobbler, since the previous year. The two were introduced by Jean-Pierre Monseré and his wife, Annie. Carine was Annie's niece. She had never heard of Maertens.\n\nThey married in November 1973 and rented a house in Lombardsijde. She said: \"I got to know a young boy who was more adult than his years and who knew what he wanted: to be a professional bike rider. I fell for him. Not because I thought he could become a great rider but because I felt straight away that I could play a role in his life, that he needed me. Three years later we were married. Our dream had started. We didn’t know then that it would turn into a nightmare\".\n\nMaertens rode his first race at Westhoek when he was 14, in 1966. The field included riders of 17 and 18, including some from France. The race was open to riders who did not have a licence from the Belgian federation, the BWB. He had trouble riding in a group. His second race went better. Among the riders he beat was Michel Pollentier, later a friend and a team colleague as a professional.\n\nMaertens continued to ride unlicensed races in 1967. In 1968 he took his first licence from the BWB, riding in the \"nieuweling\" or beginners' class. He won 21 times and came second 19 times to a rider named Vandromme.\n\nMaertens asked his father permission to leave school in his second year as a junior, or under-19, rider. He won 64 times as a junior. His father made him promise that he would train regardless of the weather.\n\nGilbert Maertens gave his son his first bike, which Freddy Maertens described as \"a second-hand thing that he’d got from a beach business for a bargain\". Not until he won a race on that would he get a better one. The author, Rik Van Walleghem, said: \"The training school that Maertens went through with his father was hard. Horribly hard. Gilbert never lost sight of anything. He knew how much and how often his son trained, what he ate and drank, how much he slept, who he went around with. He imposed a merciless regime. And he had an eye open for the slightest thing that would obstruct his son’s progress. He worried, for instance, that Freddy’s male hormones would get the better of his son and drive him into the arms of bewitching young girl who’d put the slides under his mission. Women were the devil’s work; it had been like that in the Garden of Eden and little had changed since\".\n\nGilbert caught his son flirting with a girl and took revenge by cutting his racing bike in half. He intervened with the army, when his son was called for national service, to ask that he not be given an easier time because of his reputation.\n\nMaertens' relationship with his father affected the rest of his life. He rode well only when he had a dominant figure behind him: first his father, then Briek Schotte and then Lomme Driessens. His wife described him as trusting and vulnerable, that he needed care because otherwise he would be \"like a bird waiting for a cat\".\n\nMaertens won 50 times as a senior, including the national championship at Nandrin. In 1970 he came second to the Frenchman, Régis Ovion, in the world amateur championship. He competed in the individual road race at the 1972 Summer Olympics. He turned professional in 1972. The frame-maker Ernest Colnago and the former champion Ercole Baldini came to his house with an offer to join their SCIC team. They offered to support him in his last year as an amateur and then take him as a professional.\n\nGilbert Maertens was more impressed by the Belgian businessman, Paul Claeys, who had inherited the Flandria bicycle company. Flandria already sponsored Maertens' club, SWC Torhout, and Maertens rode a Flandria bike. Claeys came to the Maertens house with his team manager, Briek Schotte, a legend in Belgian cycling. Claeys offered Gilbert Maertens a concession for Flandria bikes, allowing him to sell them without first buying them. Maertens pushed his son to sign a contract for 40,000 francs a month as an amateur and then double in his first full year as a professional. The family needed the bike concession because Silonne Maertens had fallen ill and closed her shop.\n\nMaertens said: \"I would have preferred to go to SCIC and Colnago but my father said, 'You have to do something for us too.'\"\n\nColnago and Baldini had promised more money and a gentle start as a professional. But with Flandria Maertens rode more than 200 road races a year and on the track and in cyclo-cross in the winter. He suffered what he called the poor organisation and penny-pinching attitude of Claeys and his Flandria company. He also complained about the weight of Flandria frames; rather than ride them, he had his frames made in Italy, by Gios Torino, and had them painted in Flandria colours.\n\nHe was never paid in 1979, his last season with Flandria, which had failed. It was the start of financial troubles with tax officials (see below).\n\nRik Van Wallaghem says Maertens' was naïve as a new professional. Belgian racing was dominated by Eddy Merckx and Roger De Vlaeminck. Maertens did not observe an unwritten rule that new professionals establish themselves gradually and not try to humiliate established riders. Instead, Maertens, just 21, charged in and upset everyone by demanding they make room for him and make room quickly\". What Van Wallaghem saw as his blunder was greeted, he said, by Belgian journalists eager to write of something else after years of Merckx's international domination. That worsened relations between them.\n\nRelations between the riders and their fans reached their nadir on 2 September 1973 in the world road championship around the Montjuich climb near Barcelona. Maertens had said he was not willing to ride for Merckx. That angered Merckx's supporters who, Maertens said, six times threw cold water over his legs.\n\nMerckx broke clear on a hill. Maertens said none of the others took up the chase and so he chased by himself. Merckx was angry that Maertens, in his view, had sabotaged his chances of winning. Maertens was the better sprinter.\n\nThe two were unable to cooperate and were caught by Luis Ocaña and Felice Gimondi. Maertens agreed to lead Merckx in the sprint and allow him to win. He would be well paid, he understood - \"a fantastic offer.\" But Maertens rode too fast for Merckx to stay with him. Gimondi rode in Maertens' shelter instead. Maertens realised too late and Gimondi won.\n\nEnmity between Merckx and Maertens lasted decades. It ended in 2007 when the two met in a hotel in France.\n\n\"I was smoking a cigarette and he asked me for a cigarette. He said to me, 'Freddy, we have to talk about Barcelona.' I said, 'I think so too.' And then we spoke about it for three hours and we shook hands and everything was over\".\n\nGuillaume \"Lomme\" Driessens was one of three father figures in Maertens' life (see above). He started as a masseur and soigneur for Fausto Coppi. Riders in his care won the Tour seven times. He was a team director from 1947 to 1984. He died in 2006.\n\nMaertens said: \"There was my father, then in the beginning as a professional I had Schotte, then I had Driessens...”\nDriessens provoked the rivalry between Maertens and Merckx by insisting that far from Maertens' having betrayed Merckx by chasing him, Merckx had ensured that Maertens did not win. He had, he said, hidden his exhaustion and therefore his ability to win so as to mislead Maertens into losing. The historian Olivier Dazat said Merckx had dropped Driessens as manager of his teams and that Driessens had never forgiven him. Driessens had directed his Romeo-Smith team to ride all year against Rik Van Looy in similar circumstances and now he wanted his revenge against Merckx.\n\nMaertens said: \"I enjoyed working with Driessens. There were no problems. When you work with Driessens there are no problems. A lot of people complained about Driessens, saying he took the racers' money, that he did this, he did that. But in the morning, he was the first to wake you, he prepared your food. He was a fabulous organiser\".\nHe was a dominant figure whose wish to control extended to standing over Carine Maertens to tell her she was not cooking minestrone correctly. Freddy Maertens said Driessens' visits and interventions meant they were no longer bosses in their own house.\n\nThe world championship at Barcelona was complicated by commercial interests. Professional cycling had been dominated by an Italian component maker, Campagnolo. A Japanese rival, Shimano, had recently entered the market. It supplied the Flandria team and designed a range of components specifically for it. Of the Belgian team, Maertens and Walter Godefroot used Shimano; Merckx and the others used Campagnolo.\n\nThe Belgian world championship team was training on the championship circuit two days before the race, along with some of the Italian team. Maertens said what he called the \"big boss\" [\"grand patron\"], since dead, at Campagnolo [named in his biography as Tullio Campagnolo] drove beside the group and shouted \"Sort it out between you but Shimano mustn't be allowed to win the championship\".\n\nMaertens said Gimondi won because he pushed him into the barriers at the finish. When he demanded Belgian officials protest, he said, they answered: \"We can't do that to our Italian friends\".\n\nMaertens alleges that a laxative was put in his drink during the world championship in Montreal in 1974. He was handed it while he was in the lead with Bernard Thévenet and Constantino Conti. He said his masseur, Jef D’Hont, had told Gust Naessens - Merckx's soigneur - that he was going to eat and asked him to hand a bottle to his rider. Maertens took the bottle because he trusted Naessens, with whom he worked from 1981 to 1983. Maertens said: \"I got confirmation of that from Gust Naessens. I asked him, 'What did you do in Montreal?'\" He said Naessens replied: \"It was normal, Freddy. I was asked to give you your drink and I put something in it. You were too good for my guy, so I put something in it to block you\". Merckx won.\n\nNaessens, now dead, was also Tom Simpson's soigneur when he died in the Tour de France of 1967. The following year he was banned from working in cycling for two years.\n\nMaertens started favourite for the 1976 world championship, held at Ostuni, in Italy. He came to the race in good form and with the Belgian team lined in his support. His rival, Eddy Merckx, was in decline.\n\nThe race was over hilly eight laps, a total of 288 km. The first moves came on the last lap. Yves Hézard attacked, followed by Francesco Moser and Joop Zoetemelk. Maertens made his move seven kilometres later, with Tino Conti. Maertens and Conti regained the leaders in seven kilometres. Moser attacked twice again and Maertens stayed with him. Zoetemelk and Conti lost ground. Moser realised he had no chance in a sprint with Maertens. The Belgian won by two lengths.\n\nThe Ronde van Vlaandren museum in Oudenaarde has in its window a lettered brick with the name of each year's winner. The 1977 race is shown as won by Roger De Vlaeminck. But above it is another, that reads: \"Moral winner: Freddy Maertens.\"\n\nFreddy Maertens was disqualified during the race after changing his bike on the Koppenberg hill. But he was not withdrawn from the race and he carried on riding with De Vlaeminck, a rival in another team. Maertens knew he could not win and he rode the last 80 km with De Vlaeminck in his shelter. Maertens says De Vlaeminck promised 300,000 francs, which De Vlaeminck denies. He says they never discussed money. Maertens says De Vlaeminck paid 150,000 francs, which Maertens gave to Michel Pollentier and Marc Demeyer for their help. Maertens expected a further 150,000 for his own services. De Vlaeminck says they never discussed money and the argument has never closed.\n\nFreddy Maertens often benefited by the help of his team-mates, Michel Pollentier and Marc Demeyer. They cleared a path through the bunch in the style of an earlier sprinter, Rik Van Looy. Journalists called them the Three Musketeers.\n\nIn 1976 he won eight stages of the Tour de France. He won the points classification in 1976 and again in 1978 and 1981.\n\n1977 Vuelta\n\nMaertens won the 1977 Vuelta a España by winning 13 stages, half the total. He imposed his will \"like a South American dictator\", according to the writer Olivier Dazat. He won the prologue time-trial and led the race from start to finish. 14 of the 20 stages were won by Flandria, with Pollentier taking the other stage win.\n\n1977 Giro\n\nMaertens again took the lead at the start by winning the prologue. He kept it until Francesco Moser became the race leader on stage five. Maertens was expected to take the lead again after Mugello, when there would be a time-trial. He had already won seven stages. The finish at Mugello ended in a crash. Michel Pollentier led Marc Demeyer into the last few hundred metres, with Maertens behind Demeyer. One by one they moved aside to let Maertens through. But he crashed, with Rik Van Linden, and broke a wrist. He abandoned the race and the rest of the team would have returned to Belgium had Maertens not persuaded them otherwise.\n\nWilderness years\n\nThere followed a wilderness period in which he did little of note. He started big races but often stopped after 100 km, or was dropped on unremarkable hills. It made his victory in the 1981 world championship in Prague the more remarkable. He finished in front of Giuseppe Saronni and Bernard Hinault, two short and stocky riders like himself. Journalists wondered whether the era of tall, lean riders such as Merckx, Gimondi, and De Vlaeminck was over.\n\nA year later his record faded again. He rarely finished races and shone only in round-the-houses races, where his contract fees were needed to pay his tax debts. He did not defend his title in the 1982 world championship at Goodwood, saying he had injured his knee on a gate. He became fatter and rode for small teams for equally small salaries.\n\nOlivier Dazat said: \"His employers sacked him and others stepped in to benefit from the publicity. Freddy often forgot to go to races and was fired again. The press and those around him begged him to stop\".\n\nOther successes\n\nAs well as the Tour, Vuelta and Giro, his stage race victories included Paris–Nice (1977), the Four Days of Dunkirk (1973, 1975, 1976 and 1978), the Tour of Andalucia (1974, 1975), Tour of Belgium (1974, 1975), Tour de Luxembourg (1975), Tour of Sardinia (1977) and Vuelta y Catalunya (1977).\n\nDespite his sprinting dominance, Maertens never won a one-day classic, coming closest with second places in the Tour of Flanders (1973) and Liège–Bastogne–Liège (1976). He was disqualified from second place in the 1977 Ronde after changing his bike on the Koppenberg climb.\n\nMaertens also won the season-long Super Prestige Pernod International in 1976 and 1977.\n\n1981 World Championship\n\nIn one of the most surprising comebacks in cycling history, Maertens won the 1981 World Championship, which was held in Prague. In a sprinting duel he had one ultimate jump left which sufficed to defeat runner-up Saronni.\n\nMaertens was an aggressive rider who pushed high gears. He frequently rode 53 x 13 or 14. He was a talented time-triallist and an excellent sprinter. He nurtured another sprinter Sean Kelly. His time-trial record includes winning the Grand Prix des Nations in 1976.\n\nMaertens and his wife were naïve about money. Carine Maertens said money \"flooded in\" when her husband reached the top as a professional. Maertens estimated his earnings throughout his career as 10-15 million French francs, \"which was a lot of money in the 1970s\".\n\nCarine Maertens said: \"We let ourselves be sweet-talked by sponsors, team directors, managers, architects, accountants, tax advisers, bankers, investment advisers, doctors. We believed all these people. We believed them because they dressed well and they’d been to school and they could talk well. We had no experience with money, fame, celebrity. We built far too large a villa, we borrowed money until we were raw, we invested in businesses we knew nothing about. We were honest people who trusted others, who never knew there was such nastiness in the world. By the time we realised what was happening, our bank accounts had been plundered. We had a chic villa and not a franc between us\".\n\nThe Flandria team was riding the Giro d'Italia when it heard rumours of trouble at the Flandria company. He received only half his salary in 1978 and none of the cash to be paid without its being registered in the accounts. In 1979, he was not paid at all. He lost money entrusted to others to invest, including 500 000 francs in the Flandria Ranch, run by his sponsor. He also lost 750 000 francs in a furniture business which burned down. By then he was being challenged by the tax authorities. He won little of significance. He said he was riding for nothing during the day and spending every evening with lawyers. He still disputes the tax that the government demanded. He and his wife lost their house, their car and their furniture.\n\nHe owed interest on interest and lost all he had. He calculated his tax bill at 30 million francs [almost US$1 million]. He insisted he owed 1.5 million francs [US$50,000]. He spent long periods without a job and without unemployment benefit and his wife cleaned houses. The problems lasted 30 years. They ended on 10 June 2011. He felt so bitter about Paul Claeys - \"not a good guy; he promised and promised and...” - that he refused to attend his funeral in 2012.\n\nMaertens told \"L'Équipe\" that \"like everyone else\", he had used amphetamines in round-the-houses races but he insisted that he had ridden without drugs in big Tours - not least because he knew he would be tested for them. He was angry when Belgian television used his photograph as a backdrop to discussions about drug-taking in the sport.\n\nRumours intensified when Maertens' successes became erratic. He flew to the United States to see a doctor, to confirm that he had no drug problems. He and a medical advisers flew from Amsterdam to New York City on 25 May 1979 in a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Maertens mentioned to his colleague, Paul de Nijs, that one of the engines made an odd noise. The plane continued towards Chicago but crashed on take-off when an engine fell off, killing 279.\n\nMaertens was caught in drugs tests. He was first found positive after Professor Michel Debackere perfected a test in 1974 for pemoline, a drug in the amphetamine family that riders believed to be undetectable.\n\nHe was disqualified in the Flèche Wallonne of 1977 and found guilty the same year in the Tour de France, the Tour of Belgium and the Tour of Flanders. He also had a positive finding for cortisone in 1986.\n\nMichel Pollentier is quoted as saying: \"I told him I could see only one way out for him: to see a psychiatrist, advice he considered stupid. I’ve never hesitated to confess that I spent three weeks under the surveillance of Dr Dejonckheere at the St-Joseph clinic at Ostend and that after treatment I stayed under his control for another two years. Why hide it? It’s impossible to come out of a situation like that without the help of a doctor.\"\n\nMaertens drank champagne during races. And he was for a while salesman for Lanson, a champagne company. Journalists saw crates of champagne at his house and interpreted them as confirmation that he had a drinking problem.\n\nLegend says that on the Friday before the world championship at Goodwood, England, he asked his taxi driver to join him for a pint of beer, \"because he sweating so much.\" Lomme Driessens said: \"Too much wine and not enough riding, that's his problem.\"\n\nMaertens told a reporter, Guy Roger, that the stories were exaggerated. But he acknowledged later that he did have a problem. He attended meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous until word spread that he was there. Now he drinks only non-alcoholic drinks. His body, he said, reacted quickly to alcohol and he could get drunk on a single glass of beer.\n\nMaertens retired at the age of 35 in 1987 after deciding during a training ride that he no longer wanted to train in the wind and rain of Flanders. He worked as a salesman after retiring, including in Belgium and Luxembourg for Assos, a Swiss clothing company. He left Assos, he said, when supplies became erratic. He kept a distance from the sport. His weight rose to 100 kg. In 2000 he began to work in the Belgian National Cycling Museum ('Nationaal Wielermuseum') in his hometown Roeselare. Many visitors of the museum liked the presence of a real world champion during their visit. In 2008 he moved to the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders Center) in Oudenaarde. In 2017, after health problems, he retired. He works when possible as a volunteer or special guest in both museums. The museum in Roeselare is now renamed to 'KOERS. Museum of Cycle Racing'. The bicycle shop \"Maertens Sport\" in Evergem on the outskirts of Ghent is owned by Freddy's brother Mario.\n\n\n\n\"Fall From Grace\" by Freddy Maertens and Manu Adriaens, , 1993, Ronde Publications, Hull.\n"}
{"id": "2020127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020127", "title": "Hexton", "text": "Hexton\n\nHexton is a small village and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, about west of Hitchin.\n\nThis parish is a salient of Hertfordshire jutting northwards into Bedfordshire. The southern half of the parish is part of the chalky downs of the Chiltern Hills, which are covered with short turf and plantations of fir trees. The hills end abruptly and close to their foot lies the village of Hexton. It stands among grass fields and orchards at the beginning of a low plain, which, sloping gradually to the north, becomes merged in the large plain of southern Bedfordshire. The southern boundary of the parish is the grassy Icknield Way.\n\nHexton formerly belonged to the half-hundred of Hitchin, but when it came into the possession of the abbots of St. Albans it was probably added by them to their hundred of Cashio. Hexton was originally named Hehstanstuna, Hegestanestone (11th century); Hextenestona (14th century); Hextone (15th century), from Anglo-Saxon \"Heahstānes tūn\".\n\nMuch of the parish was owned by George Hodgson, owner of Hexton Hall, a large modernized house standing in an extensive park. There is no regular village street, but most of the houses are near cross roads, which lead north, south, east and west and connect Hexton with the neighbouring small villages.\n\nHexton stands in well wooded and hilly country adjacent to the Bedfordshire border. The church, dedicated to St Faith, is mediaeval with heavy 19th-century restoration. The Manor House in its extensive park dates from at least the 15th century, although it was substantially altered in 1901.\n\nFar older is the Iron Age camp of Ravensburgh Castle, a scheduled ancient monument which straddles a hilltop a mile to the south-west. Limited excavations during the 1960s showed that it was built about 400 BC (See J.Dyer in D.W.Harding \"Hillforts: Later Prehistoric Earthworks\" (Academic Press) 1976, p. 153ff. and refortified around 50 BC (see Dyer, ditto). Rectangular in shape, and enclosing nine hectares, it is strongly defended by a double rampart and ditch on the north, west and south sides, with a more massive rampart on the vulnerable eastern flank. Of its two entrances, that at the northwest corner belongs to the original build, whilst the southeastern entrance was added around 50 BC. A gap halfway along the eastern side is modern.\n\nIt has been suggested that Ravensburgh might have been the headquarters of the Celtic chieftain Cassivelaunus, attacked in 54 BC. The excavations showed signs of burning on the eastern rampart. Access to the site is strictly limited. Finds of pottery and a bird-headed weaving comb are in the Stockwood Discovery Centre, Luton. Hexton Chalk Pit is a nature reserve managed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust.\n"}
{"id": "2020128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020128", "title": "Bernt Notke", "text": "Bernt Notke\n\nVery little is known about the life of Bernt Notke. The Notke family came from Tallinn (Estonia) and his father was probably the trader and ship-owner Michel Notke, who had his main business there. His mother was probably Michel's second wife Gertraut, who was from Visby. Bernt Notke was born in the small town of Lassan in Pomerania. He was married (at least once), but the name of his wife remains unknown; she died before he did and is not mentioned in his last will and testament. The couple is known to have had two daughters, one named Anneke and another whose name has not been preserved and who seems to have suffered from intellectual disability.\n\nHe seems to have spent part of his youth in Flanders and there begun to learn his trade as an artist. He probably worked in the workshop of tapestry weaver Pasquier Grenier in Tournai, where he learned to work on art objects of a large scale. He probably also learned how to divide the labour in a workshop in a contemporary way there, as several of his own works were large, communal undertakings (see below). In the early 1460s he settled in Lübeck, where he would continue to live for the larger part of his life, although he would also intermittently live in Sweden and frequently traveled to cities around the Baltic Sea. He is mentioned in written sources for the first time by the city council of Lübeck on 14 April 1467. In 1479, he acquired a stone house on \"Breite Strasse\", a prestigious address in Lübeck. He was in Stockholm for a prolonged period 1491 – 1497, during which time he for three years held the office of mint master of the realm in Sweden, but he left the city after the end of the regency of Sten Sture the Elder. After 1497, he lived in Lübeck until his death in 1509. In 1505, he acquired the title of \"Werkmeister\" at the Church of Saint Peter.\n\nMedieval art differed from contemporary art in several ways, not least in that while modern artists often work in private studios, the production of medieval art was a communal undertaking in a workshop. This was also the case with Bernt Notke, who was the head of such a workshop. During renovation of the large triumphal cross made by Notke in 1470–77, a note signed by Notke and five co-workers was discovered in a hollow part of one of the sculptures. It lists, apart from Notke himself, a carpenter, a painter and three other artisans. The question whether Notke was first and foremost a painter, a woodworker or simply main organiser and entrepreneur is not clear. He was called \"painter\" by the city council of Lübeck in a document from 1467. He and his workshop produced art in the form of tapestries, wooden sculptures, and paintings. The main type of artwork produced by the workshop of Bernt Notke was altarpieces, incorporating both sculptures and painting. Encyclopædia Britannica claims that he was also active as an engraver, but this claim is not found in other sources.\n\nIt has been pointed out that already the first work known to have been made by Notke (between 1463 – 1466) is of unusual character: it was a high and at least long tapestry depicting the popular late medieval motif of the \"Danse Macabre\" (the dance of Death), made for a chapel of St. Mary's Church in Lübeck. It was lost, most likely destroyed, during the allied bombing of Lübeck in 1942. A copy, made in 1701 by Anton Wortmann, survives.\n\nA second \"Danse Macabre\", made at approximately the same time as the one in Lübeck, survives in part (c. ) Tallinn (Estonia), in St. Nicholas' Church. It has been suggested that the fragment in Tallinn may have been a piece cut out from the Lübeck \"Danse Macabre\", but this is not certain. Regardless, both display the characteristic vivid expressionism that would become characteristic for Notke.\nIn 1470 – 1478, Notke executed a very large sculpture group, a so-called triumphal cross (in English sometimes referred to as a rood) for display in Lübeck Cathedral. It consists of a total of 72 sculptures and is made of oak wood; dendrochronology has confirmed that the wood comes from oak trees felled near Lübeck c. 1470. The ensemble has been praised for its realism, monumentality and expressiveness. The patron ordering the art-piece was bishop Albert Krummedik. Notke and his workshop also executed an elaborate gallery in Lübeck Cathedral, ordered by the mayor of Lübeck .\n\nIn 1479 the altarpiece of Aarhus Cathedral in Denmark was inaugurated, another monumental work from Notke's workshop. As with the Lübeck triumphal cross, it was commissioned by an important member of the clergy, bishop . With its of height, it was at the time the largest altarpiece in the Nordic countries. It consists of a large number of sculptures, where the central panel contains three large, dominating sculptures of Saint Anne, John the Baptist and Pope Clement I. The altarpiece is signed by Bernt Notke in three places. Influences from the early Northern Renaissance that began to spread from the Low Countries at this time can be traced in the realistic portraiture of some of the sculptures.\n\nAnother lavish altarpiece made by Notke is that of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Tallinn (Estonia), finished in 1483. It can be safely attributed to Notke also due to the fact that several letters by his hand have been preserved, in which he asks for the delayed payment for the altarpiece. The altarpiece is considerably more modest at a height of , but it is significant in that it is the earliest altarpiece in the Baltic region where the central panel is not a formal line-up of saints but rather depicts a biblical scene, in this case the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and Mary. Other novelties introduced to the art of the region through this altarpiece is the setting of the scene in an independent interior space (the scene takes place in a chapel) and, on the more technical side, a new system of folds in the drapery of the sculptures. It is the only of Notke's altarpieces that still retains the original paint and colour.\n\nArguably the most famous sculpture by Notke is the free-standing sculpture of \"Saint George and the Dragon\" for \"Storkyrkan\" (the main church) in Stockholm inaugurated on New Year's Eve 1489. The statue had been commissioned by the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder, to commemorate Sture's victory over King Christian I of Denmark in the 1471 Battle of Brunkeberg. There is a copy of the sculpture in St. Catherine's Church in Lübeck and one in bronze on Köpmantorget in Stockholm (inaugurated 1912). The statue inspired numerous other (albeit less elaborate) wooden depictions of the same subject in Sweden, Finland and Germany.\n\nA number of other unusual pieces of art in Sweden have been attributed to Notke's workshop. One is a portrait sculpture depicting Charles VIII of Sweden, today in Gripsholm Castle but originally possibly from the Riddarholm Church or part of the \"Saint George and the Dragon\" sculpture group (see above). The altarpiece in Rytterne Church in Västmanland in Sweden has also been attributed to Bernt Notke; it displays the \"Mass of Saint Gregory\" in an unusually realistic way. There is also a sculpture depicting Saint Eric in Strängnäs Cathedral, one depicting Thomas Becket (previously in Skepptuna Church but now in the Swedish History Museum) and an altarpiece in a church in Skellefteå in Sweden. An altarpiece that has only survived in fragments, the Schonenfahrer altarpiece (currently in St. Anne's Museum Quarter, Lübeck) is attributed to Notke on stylistic grounds.\n\nPreviously, an altarpiece in Trondenes Church near Harstad in Norway (the world's northernmost medieval church) was attributed to Notke, but the attribution has later been called into doubt. Several other works from different countries around the Baltic Sea and in Belgium have also earlier been attributed to Notke, but without much certainty. A number of works by Notke's hand have also been lost. The main altarpiece of Uppsala Cathedral was made by Notke but destroyed in a fire in 1702 (the appearance of approximately half of the altarpiece is known through drawings). Made in c. 1471, this colossal altarpiece dedicated to St. Eric probably helped establish Notke's reputation in Scandinavia. A large painting depicting the Mass of Saint Gregory for Saint Mary's Church in Lübeck is likewise known via depictions in the form of photographs, but the original was destroyed during the 1942 bombing of the city.\n\nNotke is widely recognised as an accomplished artist. He has been described as \"one of the most important artists in eastern Germany and the surrounding area during the 15th century\" and \"one of the most important late Gothic artists in northern Europe\". Philippe Dollinger states that if there is any artist who can be called \"Hanseatic\", it is Notke. It has been said that he was the only artist in northern Germany who can be compared with the astonishing artistic developments in the south of the country, and at the same time that he is the foremost representative of late Gothic art in the Baltic region. calls him one of the greatest late Gothic artists in Europe and considers especially the \"Saint George and the Dragon\" in Stockholm and the triumphal cross in Lübeck to be among the masterpieces of European sculpture. Others note his \"forceful personality\" and compares Notke to a \"North German antipode to Veit Stoss, both as a producer of altarpieces and as a personality\". Still others have been less exuberant in their praise and he has also been called \"a routine producer of altarpieces\".\n\nAs noted above, Bernt Notke directly or indirectly influenced the evolution of art in the Baltic region, and influences derived from Notke can be seen in works of art as far south as Lüneburg (where a \"Danse Macabre\" by Hans Espenrad is considered a direct influence from Notke). At least two of his pupils are known by name, (also known as Hynryk Wylsynck, fl. c. 1483, died 1533) and Henning van der Heide (ca. 1460 – 1521). Henning van der Heide is recognised as his most accomplished follower.\n\nA sculpture commemorating Bernt Notke stands in the harbour of his native town Lassan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2020130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020130", "title": "Anticipatory repudiation", "text": "Anticipatory repudiation\n\nAnticipatory repudiation or anticipatory breach is a term in the law of contracts that describes a declaration by the promising party to a contract that he or she does not intend to live up to his or her obligations under the contract. It is an exception to the general rule that a contract may not be considered breached until the time for performance.\n\nA party is considered to have repudiated a contract when they evidence a lack of willingness or an inability to perform their contractual obligations. A repudiation of a contract by one party (the repudiating party) will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the repudiating party's words or conduct.; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially the whole of the benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract. When such an event occurs, the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim. A retraction of the repudiation restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.\n\nAnother rationale for the doctrine of repudiation is based on the breach of an implied term not rendering future performance futile: \"[O]ne essential promise which is implied in every contract is that neither party will without just cause repudiate his obligations under the contract, whether the time for performance has arrived or not.\"\n\nRepudiation of the contract by one party entitles the other party the right to terminate and claim for damages. However, it is possible that the repudiating party does not repudiate the entire contract but only certain obligations. In this case, the aggrieved party will only acquire the right to terminate if the repudiating party repudiates an obligation which, if breached, would grant a right to terminate.\n\nIf the promising party's repudiation makes it impossible to fulfil its promise, then retraction is not possible and no act by the promising party can restore the performing party's obligations under the contract. For example, if A promises to give B a unique sculpture in exchange for B painting A's house, but A then sells the sculpture to C before B begins the job, this act by A constitutes an anticipatory repudiation which excuses B from performing. Once the sculpture has left A's possession, there is no way that A can fulfil the promise to give the sculpture to B.\n\nThe question arises as to why any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach. The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages as a result of the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)). If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral executory contract with non-performed duties on both sides. Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.\n\nAccording to UCC 2-713(1) damages are to be measured at the time when the buyer learned of the breach. This is easy with a one transaction sale, e.g. a widget at the purchaser's door step on X date,; but when does the purchaser learn of the breach in an anticipatory repudiation?

The stadium is located on the grounds of the main campus of the \"Universidad Tecnológica de Nezahualcóyotl\". The stadium will be renovated soon, which will decrease the capacity.\n\nThe stadium is often reported to have been constructed primarily as a venue for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. It was however already opened in 1981, while Mexico was not awarded the World Cup until 1983. The venue was first called \"Estadio José López Portillo\" before receiving the name \"Neza 86\" for the World Cup tournament.\n\nClub Deportivo Neza were in need of a suitable home arena, the Coyotes having played their home games under temporary conditions since their rise to the México Primera División in 1978. Deportivo Neza used the stadium from its opening until the club had to withdraw from the Primera División for financial reasons at the end of the 1987-88 season.\n\nAfter the Coyotes' withdrawal from professional football, newly formed CF Potros Neza stepped in. Potros had acquired their licence for then second-tier Segunda División from first-league team Correcaminos UAT, who had in turn bought their Primera División licence from Deportivo Neza. The Potros were off to a good start as they reached promotion immediately in the 1988-89 season. However, the team fell apart after their first-league licence was sold to CD Veracruz before the kick-off of the 1989-90 season.\n\nNezahualcóyotl's next sporting hope were Toros Neza, who saw promotion to the Primera División in 1993. However, right into their first season they were confronted with a problem new to Mexican football: The Mexican Football Federation questioned the suitability of Estadio Neza as a top-flight stadium, although it was only 12 years old and had 7 years before served as a World Cup venue. Soon the stadium was banned from hosting Primera División matches, so that the Toros were forced to play 14 home games of the 1993-94 season in Pachuca. After some upgrades to the stadium, first league football came back to Estadio Neza in 1994-95 and remained there until the Toros were relegated in 2000. During the following two seasons, the venue saw second-tier football, with the Toros playing in the Primera División A. After the Toros sold their licence, the stadium was threatened by vacancy.\n\nA new tenant was found in nearby Mexico City-based Atlante, who did not have their own stadium and had been guests at Estadio Azteca, which was oversized for their purposes. Atlante played most of their home matches of the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons at Estadio Neza 86, bringing first-division football back to Nezahualcóyotl. However, due to tensions between the Municipal Authority and Atlante's management, during the Clausura 2004 the club pulled out of the stadium and returned to host its home games back at Estadio Azteca.\n\nWith Atlante leaving, the stadium once again stood vacant. To remedy this, a second-tier licence was acquired for the struggling CF Potros Neza for the 2004-05 season, which was however resold after one year to Tampico Madero. Since then, the city of Nezahualcóyotl is no longer represented in any of the top three divisions of Mexican club football . Therefore, Estadio Neza 86 has been used on only by Toros Neza FC.\n\n"}

The county was divided into six districts, one of which was formed from the areas of the Keynsham and Norton-Radstock urban districts, Bathavon Rural District and part of Clutton Rural District in Somerset. The district was named after the Wansdyke earthwork.\n\nFollowing a review by the Local Government Commission for England, both the County of Avon and District of Wansdyke were abolished on 1 April 1996. Wansdyke was merged with neighbouring City of Bath to form the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset.\n\nThe Parliamentary constituency of Wansdyke, covering a similar but not identical area, was replaced at the 2010 general election when it was split and merged into the North East Somerset and Kingswood constituencies.\n"}

These coins were known from then on as \"cicognini\". As his reign of Doge continued his popularity increased because he was very diplomatic and able to tackle major problems with great success.\n\nArguably, one of his greatest successes was converting the Rialto Bridge, one of Venice's major landmarks and the only bridge over the Grand Canal of Venice, from wood to stone between 1588 and 1591. Although greater names such as Michelangelo had submitted designs, Pasquale chose the more humble architect Antonio da Ponte and his nephew Antonio Contin to design and rebuild the Rialto Bridge. After Pasquale Cicogna died of a fever in 1595 a memorial was in scribed on the bridge to the Doge. His dogaressa was Laura Morozini.\n"}

It was founded in 1952 by Dr. José P. Laurel, who became the third president of the Philippines, making LPU the only school founded by a Philippine president. He named the institution after \"lykeion\", the grove in ancient Athens where Aristotle taught his pupils. Its educational vision is founded on principles that its founder, José P. Laurel, set down. It opened its gates to its first students on July 7, 1952.\n\nTwo of LPU's most prominent features are its entrance through the \"Hall of Heroes\", commonly known as \"Mabini Hall\", which exhibits busts of revered Philippine historical figures sculpted by the National Artist Guillermo Tolentino and the famous \"Lyceum Tower\" which serves as Lyceum's trademark and stands witness to the university's history and continuing progress.\n\nMany disciplines are taught in the university, with International relations (diplomacy, international trade), business, communication and International Hospitality (hotel and restaurant management, tourism) consistently being the university's flagship courses.\n\nThe LPU has affiliate/branch campuses in Makati, Batangas, Laguna and Cavite.\n\nThe LPU Manila was built on the site where the old San Juan de Dios Hospital was located.\n\nThe university offers undergraduate and graduate programs in various fields including law, the liberal arts, diplomacy, international trade and journalism, as well as nursing, engineering, business and accountancy, mass communications, tourism, and hotel and restaurant management.\n\nIt was granted Autonomous Status by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). It is a Category \"A\" teaching university in the Philippines. Category \"A\" assessment is the highest level in the Institutional Quality Assurance through Monitoring and Evaluation framework developed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as another means to assess and monitor the quality of an institution.\n\nIt is rated one of the Philippine's Top 20 Universities by Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the only university in the Philippines who passed the accreditation of The Tourism and Hospitality Management Education, Center of Excellence or THE-ICE.\n\nIt is a member of the Intramuros Consortium which includes the technical school Mapúa University, the Catholic school Colegio de San Juan de Letran, and the city-owned \"Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila\" (University of the City of Manila).\n\nFour programs — Business Administration, Hotel and Restaurant Management, Liberal Arts, and Sciences — have \"Level 3 Reaccredited Status\" by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation while its Computer Engineering, Information Technology, Tourism, Computer Science, Nursing, Master of Public Administration, Master of Business Administration were granted \"Level 2 Reaccredited Status\" by PACUCOA.\n\nIn 2012, Lyceum marked its 60th foundation anniversary. The Philippine Postal Corporation, together with the LPU administration released a commemorative stamp.\n\nRecently, President Benigno S. Aquino III formally recognized and awarded the Lyceum of the Philippines University – Manila with the Recognition for Commitment to Quality Management in the 16th Philippine Quality Award conferment ceremonies held in Malacañang Palace.\n\n\"Liberal Arts and Science programs are granted Level 3 Reaccredited Status by PACUCOA\"\n\nThe School of Arts and Sciences was one of the three original schools of the Lyceum of the Philippines University. It had an enrollment of 350 students when it first opened in 1952, with Prof. José A. Adeva Sr. as dean.\n\nOn June 15, 1953, Recognition Nos. 281 282 s. 1953 for Bachelor of Arts and Associate in Arts respectively were granted by the Department of Education.\n\nAdeva was designated on May 17, 1962, as dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences. This was subsequently followed on May 21, 1962, by the integration of the different schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, Journalism, Foreign Service, Education, and Economics and Business Administration on May 21, 1962.\n\nPresently, CAS is composed of the following departments: Department of Legal Studies, Department of Mass Communication and Journalism and Department of Psychology. Also in the CAS are the following General Education (GE) Departments: Department of English and Literature, Department of Filipino, Department of Humanities, Department of Mathematics, Department of Natural Sciences, Department of Physical Education, and Department of Social Science.\n\nIn terms of accreditation, the following programs are Level III 1st Re-accredited by the Philippine Association of Colleges and University Commission On Accreditation (PACUCOA): AB Mass Communication, AB Journalism, and AB Legal Studies while BS Psychology has been granted Level III Re-accredited Status.\n\nThe CAS has for its main thrust the development of its faculty, staff and students. This is achieved through faculty development seminars, classroom visitations, regular faculty meetings and periodic conferences with the Department Chairs.\n\nThe college also helps the Communication and Public Affairs Department (CPAD) in its promotion/marketing activities through the annual Brain Quest, JPL Cup and Media Forum regularly attended by public and private high schools in Metro Manila.\n\nIn 2014, the College of Arts and Sciences conducted the 1st UmalohokJUAN Awards, recognizing and awarding television and radio programs and personalities.\n\n\"Programs under College of Arts and Sciences:\"\n\n\n\"Business Administration program is granted Level 3 1st Reaccredited Status by PACUCOA\"<br>\n\"Accountancy and Customs Administration program are granted Level 1 Formal Accredited Status by PACUCOA\"\n\nIn 1952, when Dr Laurel founded the university, one of his dreams was to open the door to quality education to the masses. The answer was to open during the same year the School of Commerce headed by the Senator Gil J. Puyat as its first dean with Hilarion M. Henares as the vice dean. In 1955, the school graduated 53 students who joined the public and private sectors.\n\nThe School of Commerce was later on expanded and became the School of Economics and Business Administration. In 1976, it became the College of Business Administration.\n\nIt produced seven (7) topnotchers in the CPA Board Examination since 1992 and (14) in the Customs Brokers Licensure Examination since 1999.\n\n\"Programs under College of Business and Accountancy:\"\n\n\n\"Computer Science and Information Technology programs are granted Level 3 Reaccredited Status by PACUCOA\"\n\nIn June 2001, the university decided to establish the College of Computer Studies (CCS) to cater to a rapidly increasing demand for IT Professionals. During the previous five years in which it was offered, the BS Computer Science Program had been under the administration of the College of Engineering (COE). When Lyceum decided to offer other Information Technology courses, the new College was established. By adding at least three new courses related to the Information Technology industry, Lyceum separated the Computer Science students from COE to set up the College of Computer Studies (CCS).\n\nIn 2015, the College of Computer Studies (CCS) and College of Engineering (COE) was merged and named College of Technology (COT).\n\n\"Programs under College of Technology:\"\n\n\nIn order to accommodate the increase in student population, and put together common resources and faculty, the College of International Hospitality Management (CIHM) was founded in November 1998. It was the first in the Philippines to use the appellation International Hospitality Management, the CIHM offered the BS HRM program, initially offered by the College of Business Administration (CBA) and the Bachelor of Science in Tourism (BST), originally under the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS).\n\nThe establishment of CIHM was introduced to the Council of Hotel and Restaurant Educators of the Philippines (COHREP), a professional organization of educators in the HRM program and to the Hotel and Restaurant Association of the Philippines (HRAP), a professional organization of hotels and restaurant industry members in 1999. In 2002, the CIHM also endeavored membership in the Tourism Educators in Schools, Colleges and Universities (TESCU). Participation was inactive after the first few years but in August 2009, the college joined the competitions sponsored by the organization with its new name, Union of Filipino Tourism Educators (UFTE) and has remained active since then.\n\n\"Programs under College of International Tourism and Hospitality Management:\"\n\n\nCITHM Laboratory classes are in Le Cafe, an on campus restaurant operated by students, frequented by the academic community and its guests, and a fully equipped mini hotel with a reception area, hotel suite and a housekeeping area. Aside from these, there are two mock hotel rooms that classes may use in teaching basic competencies in housekeeping. Supporting the development of skills in food and baking production, ample hands on experiences are provided in the food laboratories, one with a basic kitchen design of ten stations, and the other laboratory with an institutional kitchen design that is close to restaurant kitchen designs, with seven stations. There are also three demonstrations laboratories, with two stations, used by the food laboratory classes from time to time. A beverage laboratory complete with a functional bar is also provided for hands-on learning on various beverage preparation and service techniques. A mock bar room has also been prepared for their increasing number of classes in Bar Management and Food & Beverage Service classes.\n\nStudents are also given industry computer applications using various programs such as Amadeus, Opera and an in-house front office software program. In lecture classes, the multimedia approach is used. The International Practicum Training Program is done through arrangements with local agencies and its partner agencies which coordinate with various establishments in Singapore and the United States of America.\n\nIn school year 2009–2010, the college's name was changed from CIHM to CITHM or College of International Tourism and Hospitality Management.\n\nThe College of International Relations started out as the School of Foreign Service. It was administratively under the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). It initially offered the Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service (BSFS) degree in School Year (SY) 1954–55, as authorized by the Department of Education under Recognition No. 35 Series of 1954. A total number of 1,000 enrollees in SY 1959-60 prompted its separatione from the CAS. José P. Laurel became the acting dean of the newly separated School of Foreign Service. It was later renamed College of Foreign Service. In 2005, the college was further renamed College of International Relations (CIR).\n\nSince its establishment, the college had in its roster professors and teaching staff that included the late President Diosdado Macapagal who became a Special Lecturer teaching Philippine Foreign Relations in 1969. Ten years later, former ambassador to the Holy See, Alberto Katigbak, in his capacity as dean of the college, initiated revisions to the BSFS curriculum.\n\nThe syllabi of practically all the CIR subjects have undergone revisions to bring them up to date, including Diplomatic Practice, Introduction to International Relations, Philippine Foreign Relations, Protocol and Etiquette, and International Organizations.\n\nTo strengthen the CIR faculty, new chairpersons were appointed. Ambassador Josue L. Villa, former Philippine ambassador to Thailand and to the People's Republic of China, joined in April 2006 as chairperson of the Department of Politics, Government and Diplomacy, and Ambassador Alfredo Almendrala, former Philippine ambassador to Myanmar and Consul General in San Francisco, as chairperson of the Department of International Trade, in addition to their appointment as special lecturer.\n\nIn addition to long-time professors Ambassador Dolores Sale, Ambassador Fortunato Oblena, and General Cesar Fortuno, new professors were added to the faculty: Ambassador Apolinario Lozada, Jr., Ambassador Phoebe Gómez; Ambassador Nestor Padalhin; Ruby Sakkam, a summa cum laude graduate of St. Scholastica College; and Gil Santos, veteran journalist and former bureau chief of Associated Press. Ambassador Aladin Villacorte, former Consul General of the Philippine Consulate General in Chicago and Consul General of the Philippine Consulate General in Xiamen, P.R. of China; Ambassador Emelinda Lee-Pineda and Ambassador Estrella Berenguel have also joined the faculty recently.\n\n\"Program under College of International Relations:\"\n\n\n\"Granted Level 2 1st Reaccredited Status by PACUCOA\"\n\nOn July 16, 2002, Perla Rizalina M. Tayco, Ph.D., an OD consultant, was commissioned by the president of Lyceum of Philippines, Roberto P. Laurel, to assist the institution in the Strategic Visioning Process towards the establishment of the College of Nursing. The application for Government Permit to operate the Bachelor of Science in Nursing was granted on the following dates:\n\n\"Program under College of Nursing:\"\n\n\nThe College of Law has a separate campus in Makati City, known as the Lyceum of the Philippines University – Makati or Lyceum of the Philippines University College of Law.\n\n\"Public Administration and Business Administration master programs are granted Level 2 1st Reaccredited Status by PACUCOA\"\n\n\n\"Doctoral Degrees:\"\n\nLyceum has several registered organizations that serves the various interests and inclinations of its diverse student body.

Katherine encompasses both urban and rural areas, covering an area of 7,442 km² and taking in the city of Katherine, as well as the RAAF Base Tindal and the Binjari Aboriginal Community.\n\nThe city of Katherine has historically been a conservative bastion, making the seat of the same name a very safe Country Liberal Party seat for most of its first three decades. Its first member, Mike Reed, was Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1995 to 2001. Reed retired in 2003 and was succeeded at a by-election by Fay Miller, also of the CLP. Miller narrowly held onto her seat in Labor's landslide victory at the 2005 election, weathering another massive swing to Labor that surprised commentators on election night. In the end, however, was left as one of only two CLP MLAs in the Top End. She retired at the 2008 election and was succeeded by Willem Westra van Holthe, who picked up a swing large enough to revert Katherine to its traditional status as a safe CLP seat. The 2012 election saw Westra van Holthe seemingly consolidate his grip on Katherine when he boosted his majority to 22.3 percent, making it the safest seat in the Territory.\n\nAt the 2016 election, Westra van Holthe suffered a swing just barely exceeding the one he had picked up in 2012, and narrowly lost the seat to Labor's Sandra Nelson.

{"id": "2020169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020169", "title": "Nasi (Hebrew title)", "text": "Nasi (Hebrew title)\n\nThe noun \"nasi\" (including its grammatical variations), occurs 132 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, and in English is usually translated \"prince,\" occasionally \"captain.\" The first use is for the twelve \"princes\" who will descend from Ishmael, in , and the second use, in , is the Hethites recognising Abraham as \"a godly prince\" (\"\" ). \n\nIn the Book of Leviticus, in the rites of sacrifices for leaders who err, there is the special offering made by a \"nasi\". The Talmudic book of Horayot actually defines this to mean the king.\n\nIn the book of Numbers, the leaders of each tribe is referred to as a \"nasi\", and each one brings a gift to the Tabernacle, 12 consecutive days, with each one being listed individually by name even though they all brought the same set of gifts.\n\nLater in the history of ancient Israel the title of \"nasi\" was given to the political ruler of Judea—e.g., ; ; (comp. Yer. Hor. 3:2).\n\nDuring the Second Temple period (c. 530 - 70 ), the \"nasi\" was the highest-ranking member and president of the Sanhedrin, or Assembly, including when it sat as a criminal court. The position was created in c. 191 BCE when the Sanhedrin lost confidence in the ability of the High Priest to serve as its head. The office of \"nasi\" in the Land of Israel was comparable with the office of exilarch in Babylonia. The Romans recognized the \"nasi\" as Patriarch of the Jews, and required all Jews to pay him a tax for the upkeep of that office, which ranked highly in the Roman official hierarchy.\n\nThis position as patriarch or head of court was reestablished several years after the Bar-Kokhba revolt. This made the \"nasi\" a power which both Jews and Romans respected. The Jewish community in Babylonia also recognized him. The \"nasi\" had controlled leadership and served as a political representative to the authorities while the religious leadership was led by Torah scholars. The \"nasi\" had the power to appoint and suspend communal leaders inside and outside of Israel. The Romans respected the \"nasi\" and gave extra land and let control of own self-supported taxes. Under Jewish law, the intercalary thirteenth month in the Hebrew calendar, Adar Bet, was announced by the \"nasi\".\n\nGamaliel VI was the last \"nasi\". He died in 425 CE, after which Emperor Theodosius II suppressed the office of the patriarchate. The patriarchal tax was diverted to the Roman treasury from 426.\n\nThe term \"nasi\" was later applied to those who held high offices in the Jewish community, and Jews who held prominence in the courts of non-Jewish rulers. Certain great figures from Jewish history have used the title, including Judah the Prince (Judah haNasi), the chief redactor of the Mishnah.\n\nThe \"nasi\" were also prevalent during the 8th-century Frankish kingdom. They were a highly privileged group in Carolingian France. The Jews have collaborated with King Pepin to end Muslim rule over their city in 759. The Jews accepted surrender and Pepin was able to hold off the Saracens in Spain. Pepin rewarded the Jews with land and privileges such as the right to judicial and religious autonomy under rule of their own leadership. The heirs of the King and \"nasi\" held a close relationship until the tenth century.\n\nAccording to ethnologist Erich Brauer, among the Jews of Yemen, the title of \"nasi\" was conferred upon a man belonging to the community's most noble and richest family. There was no direct election for this post. In general, the \"nasi\" was also a scholar, well-versed in Torah, but this was not a condition for his office. Among his duties, he was a representative of the community in all its affairs before the government. He was also entrusted with the duty of collecting the annual poll-tax (\"ğizya\"), as also to settle disputes arising between members of the community.\n\nThe term Nasi was used by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn to refer to the spiritual leaders of the Chabad movement. In particular, he used the term \"Nesi Hador\" (; \"the prince of the generation\") or \"Nesi doreinu\" (; \"the prince of our generation\") to refer to his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn. This phrase was later adopted by the Rebbe's own followers to refer to Rabbi M. M. Schneersohn himself.\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, \"nasi\" means \"president\", and is not used in its classical sense. The word Nasi is used, in Israel, as the title of the Head of State and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In Hebrew, the word \"prince\" is now expressed by a synonym: \"nasi\" (as in Yehuda HaNasi) and \"\" ().\n\nMuch more recently, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz has taken the title \"nasi\" in an attempt to re-establish the Sanhedrin in its judicial capacity as the Supreme Court of Judaism.\n\nDuring the Mishnaic period, the office of nasi was filled as follows:\n\nList of Presidents of Israel:\n\"Rabban\" was a higher title than \"rabbi\" and was given to the \"nasi\" starting with Gamaliel the Elder.\n\nThe title \"rabban\" was restricted in usage to the descendants of Hillel the Elder, the sole exception being Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai (c. 30–90 ), the leader in Jerusalem during the Siege of Jerusalem in 70 and who safeguarded the future of the Jewish people after the Great Revolt by pleading with the Emperor Vespasian.\n\nRabbi Eleazar ben Azariah, who was \"nasi\" between 118 and 120 , was not given the title \"rabban\", perhaps because he only occupied the office of \"nasi\" for a short while, after which it reverted to the descendants of Hillel.\n\nPrior to Rabban Gamliel the Elder, no titles were used before anyone's name, in line with the Talmudic adage \"\"Gadol miRabban shmo\"\" (\"Greater than the title \"rabban\" is a person's own name\"). For this reason, Hillel the Elder has no title before his name: his name is in itself a title. Similarly, Moses and Abraham have no titles before their names, but an epithet is sometimes used to differentiate between biblical and historic personages, hence \"Avraham Avinu\" (Abraham 'Our Father') and \"Moshe Rabbeinu\" (Moses 'Our Teacher').\n\nStarting with Rabbi Judah I \"haNasi\" (born 135 ), not even the \"nasi\" was given the title \"rabban\". In its place, Judah \"haNasi\" was given the lofty accolade \"Rabbeinu HaKadosh\" ('Our Holy Teacher').\n\n\nJeremy Cohen, \"The Nasi of Narbonne: A Problem in Medieval Historiography,\" AJS Review, 2 (1977): pp. 45-76,\n\nJones, Lindsay, ed.

The episode was originally planned to air on April 4, 2004, but due to the voice actors going on strike, Fox aired a rerun instead.\n\nThe story is a follow-up to the episode \"Special Edna\".\n\nLove is in the air when Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel are finally getting married. They each have their bachelor party, with Edna having hers at the Simpson house with Duffman and a topless Chief Wiggum as strippers, and Principal Skinner having his at Moe's with Homer. However, at his party, Skinner admits that he has doubts about marrying Edna. When the wedding is held at Springfield Elementary's gymnasium, Edna learns that Skinner does not want to marry her, and runs away from the ceremony as Skinner tries to catch up with her while Nelson cannot bring himself to play a prank on her.\n\nAfter the wedding is called off, Homer and Marge try to get Skinner and Edna to be engaged again, but it is halted by Homer and Marge's own marriage problems. Edna returns a wedding gift to the Comic Book Guy, and she finds him to be an interesting man. Homer gets Skinner to serenade Edna using a band made up of Bart, Milhouse, and Martin, but that fails when he learns that the Comic Book Guy and Edna are in love. The family visits the Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con to confront Comic Book Guy, who proposes to marry Edna after the family sees \"Futurama\" creator Matt Groening. Skinner, dressed up as Catwoman (who he thought was Catman) battles the Comic Book Guy. Edna interrupts their fight to declare that she will not marry either man. When she tells the Comic Book Guy how they had fun but are very different, he accepts her decision, though Skinner is still upset. Later, at the Simpson house, Homer asks Marge to remarry him, which is done in the style of a mock Klingon wedding, and she accepts (although she accidentally agrees to give their children a Klingon upbringing).\n\nDVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that he \"never felt particularly interested in the Skinner/Edna relationship, so [the episode] falls in the red. It never quite rebounds from that deficit, as it fails to find much inspiration\". He added that \"A few laughs crop up along the way, but not enough to redeem it.\"\n"}

The Royal Commissioner was Greg James QC. The first hearing of the commission was on 12 May 2005 and the report was delivered on 15 July 2005.\n\nIan Humphrey was riding a bicycle on Kapunda Road, north of Adelaide, when he was struck by driver Eugene McGee, an Adelaide barrister and former police prosecutor, at 5:05 pm on 30 November 2003. McGee did not stop or render assistance.\n\n30 November 2003\n12:30pm: McGee arrives at the Wheatsheaf Hotel outside Gawler, north of Adelaide, to have lunch with his brother Craig and mother Marjorie. The tables order docket shows three bottles of white wine, a glass of port and a glass of beer are purchased.\n3:50pm: Eugene and Craig McGee leave the hotel to take their mother home to Kapunda, north of Gawler.\n3:40 - 4:00pm: Ian Humphrey leaves his home at Evanston Park to cycle to Freeling on the Kapunda/Gawler road. \n4:30 - 4:50pm: McGee leaves his mother's house to return to Adelaide. \n4:50pm: Occupants of a car travelling through Kapunda notice a dark blue/green 4WD travelling in the same direction which began overtaking them in a dangerous manner on the right. A passenger thinks the driver may have been drinking.\n5:00pm: Antoni Zisimou sees a green Mitsubishi Pajero driving erratically and swaying over the centre line at a speed of about in a zone.\n5:05pm: Ian Humphrey is struck and killed.\n5:05pm: A car is ahead of McGee travelling in the same direction. The driver sees the impact in his rear view mirror. His wife notes the registration number of McGee's vehicle and telephones police.\n5:08pm: Benjamin & Irene Voroniansky who are driving in the opposite direction stop and call an ambulance. They estimate the speed of the Mitsubishi Pajero leaving the scene to be .\n5:11pm: McGee makes the first of three phone calls to his lawyer David Edwardson.\n5:33pm: Phones his wife Barbara.\n5:37pm: Phones his brother Craig.\n5:42pm: Phones his mother Marjorie.\n5:50pm: Phones his brother Craig.

They are stopped at a police roadblock set up to find McGee but do not identify themselves.\n7:40pm: A reporter arrives at Marjorie McGee's house in Kapunda and finds McGee's car there.\n8:50pm: After being informed the car has been located, Police call at Marjorie McGee's house but find it locked up with no one home. \n9:09pm: Matthew Selley phones Sergeant Mills and states he is a solicitor representing Eugene McGee. Selley requests the \"state of play\" with regard to the collision. Mills asks for Selley's phone number so Sergeant Hassell can speak to him.\n9:10 - 10:05pm: Sergeant Hassell makes several phone calls to Selley to make arrangements to interview McGee.\n10:05pm: Police phone Selley who states McGee is willing to hand himself in the following morning.\n10:10pm: Police phone Selley who gives them an address in Norwood where they can speak to McGee.\n11:30pm: Police speak to McGee who reads from a prepared statement. McGee is arrested and taken to the City Watchhouse. Both Sergeant Hassell and Senior Constable Bell noted they could smell alcohol on McGee while he was in the police car.\n\nInitially, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was unable to find a prosecutor willing to prosecute McGee as he was very well known in the legal community and there were fears the case would never go to trial. The case eventually went to trial in May 2005 where McGee was acquitted of causing death by dangerous driving, but convicted of the lesser offences of driving without due care and failure to stop and render assistance following an accident. This was due to psychiatric evidence of McGee exhibiting Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms following the accident. Sandy McFarlane from Adelaide University stated the PTSD was due to \"horrific experiences\" during McGee's former career as a police officer and in dealing with the evidence in the Snowtown trials as a solicitor for one of the murderers. McGee admitted he had not sought psychiatric or psychological treatment for the condition until 18 February 2004 (80 days after the incident) and no evidence of his erratic or dangerous driving prior to the accident was given at trial. He was fined $2,250 and was disqualified from holding a driver's licence for twelve months.\n\nHowever, there was controversy over this conviction and the alleged reluctance of prosecutors to present evidence from Tony and John Zisimou who saw McGee's blue Pajero 4WD driving erratically at around 160 km/h (100 mph) approximately 1½ minutes before the accident (McGee's vehicle was actually green but television footage showed that at night, and under artificial lighting, it looked blue). Tony Zisimou's car was the third to stop at the scene and John, a nurse, declared the victim deceased and was credited for preserving the scene for police and preventing other witness from leaving before their arrival. There are also alleged anomalies concerning the behaviour of police in not breath testing McGee and the opportunity that major prosecution witness Tony Felice had to give evidence. Felice saw the accident in his mirror and his wife wrote the Pajero's plate number down as it continued down the road. At trial Sergeant Hassell gave evidence that while he knew he had the power to test for alcohol, they were short staffed and under pressure so it was not something he had considered at the time.\n\nGroups supporting cyclists and victims of crime groups staged a number of protests against the decision of the court and the Government created the Royal Commission.\n\n\nProceedings commenced on 12 May 2005. Evidence was heard from lawyers involved in the trial, respected psychiatrists, police officers, witnesses and members of the McGee family. Members of the public also made submissions. Craig McGee exercised his right not to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination. McGee was represented by SA Bar Association president Malcolm Blue QC. Blue was later appointed a Supreme Court judge.\n\nChris Tennant of Sydney University and another \"very senior\" professor of psychiatry were asked to review the psychiatric evidence and both concluded the evidence was not credible. Tennant stated; \"I’ve never been more personally outraged about what I personally see as being a, in the common lingo, a mistrial, a travesty of the justice system.\"\n\nProceedings concluded on 1 July 2005 with the final report submitted on 15 July.\n\nRetraining of police. More extensive pretrial disclosure of expert evidence. Courts permitted to appoint independent experts. The law be changed to allow police to be able to forcibly enter premises for searches. The penalty for death by dangerous driving to be increased to the same level as manslaughter. Increased penalties for fleeing an accident. Attempting to disguise blood alcohol levels should be an offence.\n\nCommissioner James also produced a second closed (secret) report of recommendations for relevant agencies and ministers. It was the recommendations of this report that led to further charges being laid.\n\nCharges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice were laid against McGee and his brother Craig on 26 August 2005 over allegations they worked together to \"frustrate, deflect or prevent\" the police investigation into the hit and run in order to prevent police gaining \"evidence of the blood-alcohol reading and sobriety of Eugene McGee\". On 10 March 2006 the defense asked for a stay of proceedings and the case was adjourned to 9 November, after several further stays the defense asked for a permanent stay on 17 July 2007 arguing that the publicity would mean the brothers would be unable to gain a fair trial. The stay application was rejected on 14 February 2008, however, they could not stand trial until 2 February 2010 because their lawyer would be \"unavailable\" until that date. On 2 February, citing as a precedent an immigration case before the British House of Lords in 1972, the case was again delayed until 17 March. The House of Lords had found that after failing to attend a meeting there was no statutory obligation for an Indian immigrant to turn himself in as he had not been directed to do so by the immigration department, which McGee's lawyer claimed was \"directly analogous\" to the case of McGee. On 17 March, at a hearing that lasted less than a minute, District Court Judge Peter Herriman acquitted the McGees of the conspiracy charges finding that \"There was no legal obligation then falling upon Eugene to surrender himself or upon either of them to assist police.\"\n\nMcGee is still listed with the Law Society as a practising solicitor. Websites advertising his practice list McGee as a defence lawyer for charges of drink driving, culpable driving and dangerous driving offences, which has caused anger in the community. Humphrey's widow Di Gilcrist stated, \"He is actually profiting from the experience and the stigma that the case has afforded him...It is a sad reflection of the criminal justice system that something so black and white could be manipulated to absolve McGee of his lack of moral and ethical responsibility\" Di Gilcrist subsequently complained to the legal board that McGee's actions [following the hit-run] amounted to professional misconduct.\n\nIn April 2011, a hearing before the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board found McGee was not guilty of \"infamous conduct\" and ruled he could continue to practise. The Conduct Board accepted that McGee was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and ruled that it could only consider his actions in the first few seconds after the crash and could not consider his telephone calls to family, his legal adviser or his actions to avoid police. Following the ruling, Senator Nick Xenophon said the outcome was a disgrace and the entire board should be sacked. Attorney-General John Rau stated he would review the Conduct Board's decision.\n\nOn 8 December 2011 Attorney-General John Rau closed the McGee case after Crown legal advice suggested the Conduct Board's decision could not be challenged. Opposition justice spokesman Stephen Wade said Rau could overturn the Board's ruling not to ban Mr McGee from practising and challenged him to release the Crown's legal advice. Senator Xenophon told the media; \"Show us the advice, otherwise his opinion and his decision not to act lacks credibility... Only by releasing the legal advice will the Attorney-General show he has a genuine commitment to justice in the McGee case\".\n\nOn 6 February 2012, McGee apologised on national television for the 2003 hit and run when he appeared in a two-part television special on the case on ABC's \"Australian Story\". Humphrey's family claimed they had been denied justice and that McGee had never apologised to them face-to-face. McGee replied that an apology had been offered through his solicitor years before which had been rejected and it had not been repeated out of respect for the family's privacy. McGee stated: \"Can I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy to the family for their loss. I'm sorry for what occurred and to apologise to them for my reaction to the accident.\"\n\nFollowing the Attorney-General's refusal to release the legal advice supporting his decision not to overturn the Board's ruling, on 18 February 2012, Senator Xenophon made a plea for the public to contact their MPs demanding that Attorney-General Rau take action.\n\nIn October 2013, the South Australian Parliament amended the Legal Practitioners Act 1981 (SA) to replace the existing categories of \"unsatisfactory conduct\" and \"unprofessional conduct\", with the categories of \"unsatisfactory professional conduct\" and \"professional misconduct\". The changes to the definitions were designed to prevent a repeat of the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board's hearing that found McGee not guilty.\n\n"}

His father, Francesco, son of Triadano Gritti, died soon after, and his mother, Vienna, daughter of Paolo Zane, remarried in 1460 to Giacomo Malipiero, with whom she had two more sons, Paolo and Michele. Andrea had a very close relationship with his half-brothers. Andrea was brought up by his paternal grandfather, receiving his first education at his grandfather's house in Venice, before going on to study at the University of Padua. At the same time he accompanied his grandfather on diplomatic missions to England, France, and Spain. \n\nIn 1476 he married Benedetta, daughter of Luca Vendramin, but she died at childbirth of their son, Francesco, on the same year. Widowed, Gritti moved to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, where he engaged in trade, particularly of cereals, often in partnership with the Genoese merchant Pantaleo Coresi. He enjoyed the guidance of his great-uncle, Battista Gritti, who gave him insight on important officials and traders. Gritti's enterprise was successful and allowed him to live a prosperous life during his almost twenty-year stay in the city. At his home in the quarter of Galata, he lived with a Greek woman, with whom he had four illegitimate sons: Alvise, Giorgio, Lorenzo, Pietro. He also became a person of prominence in the Italian community of Galata, serving as head of the Venetian community. He also enjoyed a good relationship with the Ottoman grand vizier, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, securing from him various accommodations and exemptions in exchange for frequent monetary donations, as well as the esteem of Ahmed Pasha's father-in-law, Sultan Bayezid II.\n\nIn 1492, the Venetian Bailo in Constantinople, Girolamo Marcello, was expelled on the charge of espionage. The post remained vacant, and Gritti assumed the task of representing Venice at the Ottoman court. Lacking an official appointment, however, his position was precarious, especially as, with another Ottoman–Venetian conflict looming in 1499, he used his commercial correspondence, sent via Corfu and the Ragusan merchant Nicolò Gondola, to transmit encoded information to the Venetian Senate regarding the movements of the Ottoman navy (referred to as \"carpets\" in one letter) and troop concentrations. This activity did not remain hidden from the Turks for long, however: after capturing couriers bearing Gritti's letters, in August 1499 he was imprisoned in the Yedikule Fortress, escaping execution only through his friendship with the grand vizier. According to contemporary reports, his imprisonment caused great consternation among his many friends—including Turks—at the Ottoman capital, as well as the many women enamoured in him.\n\nGritti nevertheless spent 32 months in the fortress, along with other Venetian merchants, coming close to death due to the privations of this long imprisonment. He was released after a ransom of 2,400 ducats was paid, and returned to Venice. Gritti played a role in the negotiations and conclusion of the peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in December 1502, and then took active part in the reception of the Ottoman ambassador Ali Bey and the finalization of the treaty on 20 May 1503. Gritti's experience with the diplomatic customs of the Ottomans led to his being charged with overseeing the final formulation of the treaty's clauses, so as to remove any ambiguities and causes for misinterpretation. Finally, on 22 May, he left Venice with Ali Bey for Constantinople, bearing the draft treaty and a letter by the Doge to the Sultan. After the ratification of the treaty by the Sultan, he returned to Venice, making his report in the Senate on 2 December 1503.\n\nThe war and his long imprisonment put an end to Gritti's commercial career, costing him the enormous sum of 24,000 ducats. With little hope of recompense for his losses, he was forced in 1517 to ask the Senate's permission to accept a gift from the King of France as partial restitution of his losses. Rather than retiring, however, he now embarked on an active political career.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century, Venice lost nearly all its territory on the Italian mainland during the War of the League of Cambrai, and Gritti played an important part in the events connected with this loss and the eventual return to the \"status quo ante\". In 1509, after the Venetian defeat at the Battle of Agnadello, Gritti was appointed as proveditor to the Venetian army in Treviso; ordered by the Council of Ten to support revolts against the invaders, he successfully engineered the return of Padua to Venetian hands, and its subsequent defence against the Emperor. In 1510, following the death of Niccolò di Pitigliano, Gritti took command of Venice's army, but was forced to withdraw to Venice by French advances. He continued as proveditor through end of the conflict. In 1512, he led the negotiations with Francis I of France that resulted in Venice leaving the League and allying with France.\n\nElected Doge in 1523, Gritti concluded a treaty with Charles V, ending Venice's active involvement in the Italian Wars. He attempted to maintain the neutrality of the Republic in the face of the continued struggle between Charles and Francis, urging both to turn their attention to the advances of the Ottoman Empire in Hungary. However, he could not prevent Suleiman I from attacking Corfu in 1537, drawing Venice into a new war with the Ottomans. His dogaressa was Benedetta Vendramin.\n\nGritti died on 28 December 1538. \n\n\n\n"}

The dam was completed in 1962 and expanded in 1966 and 1976. It supplies Tabaquite, Brasso, Williamsville, Gasparillo, San Fernando, Debe, Penal, Princes Town, Rio Claro, South Oropouche, La Brea Moruga, New Grant, Plaisance Park, La Romaine and Fyzabad.\n\nThe Navet Dam covers an area of and has a capacity of 18,200,000m³ (4,000 million imperial gallons). It supplies 86.4 m³ per day.\n\nThe Caroni–Arena Dam is the largest dam in Trinidad and Tobago. It is located in the Arena Forest Reserve, south of Arima, in the eastern Caroni Plains. WASA supplies water to areas of central Trinidad by purifying the water from the dam. It was opened in the late 1970s/early 1980s.\n\nHollis Reservoir is a reservoir located in north Trinidad supplying Arima, Port of Spain and other areas of north Trinidad. It is also a popular tourist attraction. Located about three miles off the Valencia Road, the Hollis Dam is the oldest dam in Trinidad and Tobago. It was built between 1934 and 1936, under the reign of Sir Claud Hollis, who governed Trinidad and Tobago from 1930 to 1936. This man-made lake is fed from the waters of the Quare River and rainfall from the surrounding mountains. When full it can supply 8.2 million gallons of water to people in Arima, Nettoville, Cleaver Road, Bregan Park, D'Abadie and Arouca. With the dry season, the supply is cut in half. The Hollis catchment also supports a variety of animal life such as lappe, tattoo, howler monkeys, deer, wild hogs, caiman, talapia and snakes. Hunting and fishing are not permitted near the dam. Visitors are allowed to picnic, courtesy of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago. Foreign visitors and locals regularly hike from the dam into the surrounding mountains to experience the spectacular wildlife that the dam, and its surrounding area, have to offer. There are 90 species of birds that call Hollis their home, some permanent, and some migrating for the winter. Visitors and personnel are not permitted to swim at the dam.\n\nThe Hillsborough Reservoir is the major source of drinking water for the island of Tobago. Located 36.5 metres (100 ft) above sea level, the reservoir is managed by Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago.

This was the first use of a hare-based pun title in the Warner Bros. cartoons; it would be a device used to name the vast majority of Bugs Bunny cartoons in the years to come.\n\nA man (named as John Sourpuss) reading a newspaper comes across an article stating that meat prices have soared and the consumers are sore. Angry, he declares that he'll hunt his own meat to get back at the government for the price inflation. He takes his dog with him, revealing he is going hunting for rabbits.\n\nIn the woods, a rabbit leads the dog into a hollow log and pushes the log down a hill, where it smashes into a tree. Meanwhile, John sees several rabbits hopping over a hill. He fires his gun several times and runs to where the rabbits were. When he gets there, he finds two spinning wheels with pictures of rabbits on them, giving the perception of moving rabbits.\n\nHe then sees the rabbit sleeping.

Before he reaches the cave, a pair of elevator doors closes, which the hunter runs into.\n\nThe bunny then dresses as a female dog, successfully seducing the hunter's dog. When the dog finally realizes he's with the rabbit rather than another dog, he resumes his chase. The rabbit then pretends he's a policeman, citing the dog for numerous crimes (speeding, running on the wrong side of the street, intoxicated \"driving\", etc.).\n\nAfter confusing the dog and running away, the rabbit begins singing a song about how crazy he is. When he finishes his song, he turns to find the hunter with his gun aimed at him. The rabbit, trying to gain sympathy, begs for his life, explaining how poor and sick he is. John begins crying, feeling sorry for the rabbit. Despite this, the rabbit shocks John with a joy buzzer. The hunter then shouts that he can whip the rabbit and his whole family. Suddenly, a large group of rabbits surround John, looking for a fight (see \"Lost/recovered Ending\" below for the true ending).\n\n\n"}

Some of the latter had a huge significance in the history of Nigeria before they were subdued by the British during Colonial Nigeria. Nevertheless, even today, their principal rulers have been able to maintain their religious, cultural and, to a certain extent, political influence.\n\nThe regalia used by these monarchs was and is still normally an object or collection of objects of a symbolic significance, such as a coat, robe, mantle, or costume with headgear of same shape or fashion. \n\nFor example, the ceremonial crown of an Oba of the Yoruba people is a cap made out of glass beads embroidered on plain weave striped and printed cotton over a metal frame.\n\nOther objects included in a comprehensive list of regalia could be small to medium-sized statues, such as those found in the Benin Kingdom.\n\nThe regalia often had more than merely a political significance. In the southern kingdoms most especially, it was vital for the performance of religious rituals. In this case, the ruler was seen as a link between the world of the living and the spiritual hereafter. Furthermore, in the north, the Muslim emirs and sultans had religious functions as spiritual commanders. The regalia in this case did not have any connotations of a metaphysical nature, but was seen primarily as a symbol of the power of the ruler concerned.\n\nThe regalia today would be kept at the respective capital cities, usually in the palace or palaces of each state.\n\nIn April 2005, an exhibition was shown at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, which featured a selection of regalia from 16 states, including Sokoto, Kano, and Borno. The exhibition was organised by the Federal Ministry of Information. An exhibition of photos by George Osodi in London demonstrated an array of Nigerian monarchial styles. Another exhibition took place at the Newark Museum in 2015..\n\nA controversy involving some of the crown treasures in question which is currently raging is the celebrated case of the Benin bronzes, sacred items of mostly metallic statuary that were taken by the British colonial powers after their war against the Kingdom of Benin in the 19th century. The bronzes were used for various royal rituals, and were of the highest importance in the traditional religion of the Edo.\n\n"}

It was established in 1973. \n\nThe NLC Chairman is Samuel Bush-Blanasi.\n\nIt is one of four in the Northern Territory, the others are:\n\nThe most important responsibility of the councils is to consult traditional landowners and other Aboriginals who have an interest in Aboriginal land about land use, land management and access by external tourism, mining and other businesses. This sometimes involves facilitating group negotiation and consensus-building among scores of traditional Aboriginal landowner groups, and many other affected Aboriginal people. There are 30,000 Aboriginal people from 200 communities. \n\nMany Aboriginal people in the Northern Land Council's area live in the major towns. There are about 200 communities scattered over Aboriginal land in the NLC's area, ranging in size from small family groups on outstations to settlements of up to 3,000 people.\n\nThe Northern Land Council is a representative body with statutory authority under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.

He was also margrave of Antwerp from 1106 to his death.\n\nGodfrey was the son of Henry II (c. 1020–1078) and Adela of Orthen (or Betuwe), a daughter of Count Everard of Orthen. He succeeded his brother Henry III who died wounded in a tournament in 1095, and only had young daughters. His widow Gertrude married Theodoric II, Duke of (upper) Lorraine.\n\nHe first came into conflict with Otbert, Bishop of Liège, over the county of Brunengeruz that both claimed. In 1099, Emperor Henry IV allotted the county to the bishop, who entrusted it to Albert III, Count of Namur. Godfrey arbitrated a dispute between Henry III of Luxembourg and Arnold I, Count of Loon, over the appointment of the abbot of Sint-Truiden.\n\nGodfrey was in favour with the emperor and defended his interests in Lorraine. In 1102, he stopped Robert II of Flanders \"the Crusader\", who was invading the Cambraisis. After the death of the emperor in 1106, his son and successor, Henry V, who had been in rebellion, decided to avenge himself on his father's partisans. Duke Henry of Lower Lorraine was imprisoned and his duchy confiscated and given to Godfrey. After Henry escaped from prison, he tried to retake his duchy and captured Aachen, but ultimately failed.\n\nIn 1114, during a rift between the emperor and Pope Paschal II, Godfrey led a revolt in Germany. In 1118, the emperor and the duke were reconciled. In 1119, Baldwin VII of Flanders died heirless and Flanders was contested between several claimants, one of whom, William of Ypres, had married a niece of Godfrey's second wife. Godfrey supported William, but could not enforce his claim against that of Charles the Good. Also dead in that year was Otbert. Two separate men were elected to replace him and Godfrey again sided with the loser.\n\nBy marrying his daughter Adeliza to Henry I of England, who was also the father-in-law of the emperor, he greatly increased his prestige. However, Henry V died in 1125 and Godfrey supported Conrad of Hohenstaufen, the duke of Franconia, against Lothair of Supplinburg. Lothair was elected. Lothair withdrew the duchy of Lower Lorraine and granted it to Waleran of Limburg (c. 1085 – 1139), the son of Henry, whom Henry V had deprived in 1106. Nonetheless, Godfrey maintained the margraviate of Antwerp and retained the ducal title (which would in 1183 become Duke of Brabant).\n\nAfter the assassination of Charles the Good in 1127, the Flemish succession was again in dispute. William Clito prevailed, but was soon fraught with revolts. Godfrey intervened on behalf of Theodoric of Alsace, who prevailed against Clito. Godfrey continued to war against Liège and Namur.\n\nGodfrey spent his last years in the abbey of Affligem. He died of old age on 25 January 1139 and was buried in the left aisle of the abbey church. He is sometimes said to have passed in 1140, but this is an error.\n\nHe married Ida of Chiny (1078–1117), daughter of Otto II, Count of Chiny, (c. 1065 – after 1131) and Adelaide of Namur. They had several children:\n\n\nLater, he married Clementia of Burgundy (c. 1078 – c. 1133), daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy, and widow of Robert II, Count of Flanders. They had no children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020234", "title": "Street magic", "text": "Street magic\n\nStreet magic falls into two genres; traditional street performance and guerrilla magic. \n\nThe first definition of street magic refers to a traditional form of magic performance - that of busking. In this, the magician draws an audience from passers by and performs an entire act for them. In exchange, the magician seeks remuneration either by having a receptacle for tips available throughout the act (known in the parlance as a \"trickle show\"), or by offering a receptacle for tips at the end of the show. The term \"passing the hat\" comes from the practice of having the hat passed before the final trick is performed, as opposed to \"bottling\" the audience at the end of the performance.\n\nStreet magic most often consists of what has been referred to in the past as \"hand\" or \"pocket\" magic, sleight of hand. Whether card magic or magic performed with coins, balls, scarves, or rope, even occasionally mentalism (see notably: Kenny Lightfoot), regardless of the props involved, the ability to draw and hold an audience is cited by contemporary practitioners as a skill of greater importance than the illusions themselves.\n\nThe famous Indian Mango Tree is an old and venerated trick as performed by street magicians of the past and while it is demonstrably not of the hand magic variety, it exemplifies the fact that even large stage sized illusions can be presented in the street. In the trick, the magician apparently plants a mango seed, covers it with a cloth, makes mysterious incantations and, removing the cloth from time to time successively shows a tree of various heights, up to two or three feet. The same effect was achieved by the Apaches. Instead of a mango seed, a yucca seed was planted and watered. Covering the seed with a rawhide animal skin, the seed would apparently root, grow and finally flower within the span of but a few minutes.\n\nAnthropologists chronicle this form of street magic from approximately 3,000 years ago - and there are records of such performers across the continents, notably Europe, Asia/South Asia and the Middle East. While it is a very old performing style, its history is not particularly well documented in print. In his diary, Samuel Pepys mentions seeing magicians performing in this fashion and one can see street magicians in depictions by Hieronymous Bosch, William Hogarth, and Pieter Brueghel. Book XIII of Reginald Scot's \"Discoverie of Witchcraft\" (1584) describes magic tricks of the type performed by buskers in the 16th century.\nNew York based artist and magician Jeff Sheridan is regarded as one of the pre-eminent U.S. street magicians to emerge from the surge in street performance artistry which began in the late '60s. He authored the 1977 book, \"Street Magic\", taught Jeff McBride and allegedly was one of the performers who inspired and taught the young David Blaine after Blaine saw Sheridan perform in Central Park.\n\nMore recently, other performers have garnered accolades from the magic community for their contributions to the art. Jim Cellini (a.k.a. Richard Sullivan) has been a full-time street performer since the 1970s and has published a book (\"Cellini: The Royal Touch\") and DVDs (\"The Art of Street Performing, volumes 1 - 3\") on the subject. Gazzo Macee (a.k.a. Gary Osborne) has been a full-time street performer since the 1980s and has published a booklet (\"\"The Art of Krowd Keeping\" written for Gazzo by Danny Hustle and Jim Wells\") and DVD (\"Street Cups\") on the subject. Eric Evans has been a full-time professional since the 1990s and co-wrote -- along with Nowlin Craver -- a book on the subject (\"The Secret Art of Magic\").\n\nThe second category is more appropriately called \"guerrilla magic\" It is a relatively recent style of performing magic illusions where the magician performs a single trick or two in a public space (such as on a sidewalk) for an unpaying audience. The desired effect of this \"hit and run\" style of magic is to give the audience a feeling that what they are seeing is impromptu, unrehearsed, and experimental.\n\nThis style of \"street magic\" is associated with David Blaine (who popularized the term) and more recently, Criss Angel, Derren Brown and Cyril Takayama. The format was developed to play well on television beginning with the 1997 ABC television special \"David Blaine: Street Magic.\" Many magicians respect Blaine's choice of material and give him credit for creating an image of the contemporary magician distinct from other magicians in recent television history, such as David Copperfield or Doug Henning. However, magic historians, such as Jamy Ian Swiss note that \"guerrilla magic\" is primarily associated with only a few individuals who perform on television and certain magic dealers that sell effects to amateur magicians who watch these programs. Eugene Burger opined to Jamy Ian Swiss \"On one level it's the ultimate trivialization of magic: accosting strangers on the street.\"\n"}
{"id": "2020237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020237", "title": "Desmoche", "text": "Desmoche\n\nDesmoche (played in Honduras as conquién, with slight variations) is a popular rummy card game usually played for small stakes which closely resembles other games in the rummy family, like Conquian and gin rummy, more than poker. It was probably devised in Nicaragua in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nThe object of desmoche is to play, in either runs or sets, exactly ten cards on the table. \nThe game is played by 2, 3 or 4 players with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.\n\nAny player may start out as the dealer, which then rotates from round to round in a counterclockwise fashion. The player on the dealer's right may cut the deck before the dealer deals the cards face-down starting with the player on the right and continuing until each player receives nine cards. Cards that are not dealt remain in the deck, which is placed in the middle of the table and used throughout the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter players are dealt nine cards each, but before play begins, each player chooses one card from their hand and passes it face down to the player on their right. The \"Cambio\" (also known as \"exchange\", \"pass\" or \"trade\") can be a crucial factor in deciding one's hand.\n\nIf any of the \"automatic win\" specifications (available below) have been met either before or after the Cambio, the player with the winning hand must declare they have won and place their cards face up on the table for the other players to confirm the automatic win.\n\nOtherwise, normal play begins.\n\nThe player to the right of the dealer begins play by drawing a card from the deck, being careful not to place that card into the cards already in their hand. If the player can make use of the card to create a meld, he does so by placing the card on the table in front of him and adding the cards from his hand to finalize the meld, all cards in the meld must be face up. If the card cannot be immediately used, it is placed face up in the discard pile. If any other player can use that card to create a meld, they can then play it face up on the table in front of them. If more than one player can use the card, the first player in counter-clockwise order from the player who discarded it gets to take it.\n\nIf no one can use the first card drawn, a second card is then drawn by the same player to the right of the dealer. Each player only draws one card before the next person's turn for the remainder of the game.\n\nEach player is to always maintains nine cards in their possession. This includes both the cards in the player's hand and the cards which have been played face up on the table. If a player uses a card from either the deck or the discard pile, in order to maintain a count of nine cards the player must \"pay\" for this card by discarding a card from their own hand. Once a player discards a card that no one can use, play continues to that player's right, regardless of whether any other player's turns seemed to have been skipped.\n\nThe only time a player will have more than nine cards is when they have won, at which time they will have exactly ten cards.\n\nIf no player has played ten cards face up on the table by the time the final card has been discarded from the deck, there is no winner and, if playing for money, the bet for the next game is added to the current pot.\n\nWhether there is a winner or not, the player to the right of the previous dealer is now the dealer, and play continues.\n\nMuch like Poker, game play ends when a player is out of money or simply no longer wishes to continue playing.\n\nMelds in desmoche must contain a minimum of three cards. They can be runs of the same suit (i.e. ) containing three to ten cards, or sets of three or four cards of identical rank (i.e. ). After a player has played a meld on the table, it can be added to by cards in that player's hand or by any cards that are discarded by a player that will continue the meld.\n\nThe highest run allowed is J Q K, a meld of Q K A is not allowed. A 2 3 is the smallest run allowed, but is often considered the highest valued run (see Bonuses below).\n\nSometimes players enforce strict rules for laying down melds, in which a player is disqualified if their cards are not arranged in the correct order. Runs must be placed in ascending order, like and not . Sets must be played with suit color alternating, i.e. not .\n\nA player performs a desmoche, which the game is named for, by taking a card from any of his face up melds to use in another meld, but only as long as all melds that remain on the table are still valid melds (i.e: can be used to desmoche an to create a new meld of because is still a valid meld).\n\nAll automatic wins MUST be declared before the first card is drawn for game play, otherwise the win is forfeited and the game continues as normal. All automatic wins are valid if the terms are met either before or after the \"Cambio\". Ace is always considered the highest card for deciding upon multiple automatic wins.\n\n\nIf the players are \"playing everything\" as stated in the bonuses section below, all losing players must pay a bonus to the winner because they are all \"Arriba del Palo\".\n\nIn the Honduran variation Conquién there is not automatic wins.\n\nWhen a card is discarded and more than one person can make use of the card, the person closest in the counter-clockwise rotation to the player who discarded the card gets first priority. This means that, if the person on the far left of the circle wants to use the card, and, the person in the first order of the rotation wants to use it as well, the player in the first rotation gets to have that card. Often players signify in order when a card does not \"serve\" them by knocking on the table.\n\nIf a card placed on the discard pile can be added to any meld currently on the table it can be forced onto the meld and the player will have to \"pay\" for the card by discarding from their hand. If the player discarding the card is the same person with the meld, the card can be forced back to them, but if another player wants the card, they can take it (this is sometimes debated). If the card can be added to another player's meld, and the card is not taken by a player who is earlier in the rotation, then the card is automatically added to the meld and the player is forced to \"pay\" for that card. For example, if a player has on the table and the card being discarded is , the card is automatically placed on that sequence if no player earlier in the rotation claims it, and the player has to pay for that card. However, this rule is not always followed.\n\nThe betting in desmoche takes place before the cards have been dealt. Every player bets the same amount for each hand, which is determined before playing. The bet can only change before cards are dealt, if all players agree upon the new bet. The bet does not get raised during the play of a hand. If a game ends without a winner, each player adds the same bet as the previous game to the pot for the next game. (This is called \"Doble\", \"Triple\", \"Quadruple\", etc.)\n\nWhen a player realizes they cannot win and can confirm there are no cards left in the deck that can be placed on their melds already face up on the table, they are allowed to pass their turn for the remainder of the hand, at which time they can place their melds face down to prevent the other players from seeing them. (i.e: If a player's face up cards include: and , no more cards can be added to their melds because they already have their own .)\n\nIf the players decide \"to play everything\" or \"jugar todo\" there are possible bonuses involved with winning, the bonus is equal to the amount of the bet at the start of the hand.\n\n\nThese bonuses are allowed to be stacked. For example, if a player wins with they are due a bonus for \"Color\" and for \"Mico\" from each player, and if any players are \"Arriba del Palo\" they must pay the winner for that as well.\n\nIn the Conquién game there is not bonuses.\n\nPlayers can also bet on side games with separate pots of money. These games must be started before the cards are dealt. Players of the main game are not required to join the side games.\n\nThe following is a list of the side game names followed by their requirement to win.\n\n\nTo win a side game, the winning card(s) must be received on the deal and not on the \"Cambio\". If a player has a possible winner in their hand, they must announce that they have it before the \"Cambio\" and they must show it when the cards are played or discarded, or at the end of the game if it is still in their hand after someone else has won. For these side games, Ace is considered the highest card, and 2 is considered the lowest card. For \"escalera\" A 2 3 is often considered a higher run than J Q K, but this is sometimes debated.\n\nIn Honduras the only side game that is used to be played, is \"oro\".\n\nIf a player is disqualified, their cards are removed from game play and they must wait until the next hand to continue playing.\n\nReasons for disqualification include:\n\nEnforcement of these rules depends on the players. It is not uncommon for these offenses to be immediately forgiven, with play continuing as normal without any disqualification.\n\n"}

It is a common European species and it is found in Africa and across Eurasia except for the northernmost parts.\n\nIt is a cutworm in the genus \"Agrotis\", which possibly is the genus that includes the largest number of species of cutworms.\n\nIt is usually known as the common cutworm in English. It is sometimes called the turnip moth in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis is a very variable species with the fore-wings ranging from pale buff through to almost black. The paler forms have three dark-bordered stigmata on each fore-wing. Antennae of male bipectinated (comb like on both sides) with moderate length branches. The main feature distinguishing it from other \"Agrotis\" species is the shade of the hind-wings, pure white in the males and pearly grey in the females. The wingspan is 32–42 mm.\n\nEdward Meyrick, an English schoolteacher who is especially notable for his study of the microlepidoptera, had this to say about the species:\nIt is possible it has been spread by the international trade in nursery stock.\n\nIn the British Isles, two broods are produced each year, the adults flying in May and June and again in August and September. It is known to migrate some distances. The species is nocturnal and is attracted to light and nectar-rich flowers. The species overwinters as a caterpillar.\n\n\"Agrotis segetum\" is one of the most important species of noctuid moths whose larvae are called cutworms. The larvae are generally grey, sometimes tinged with purple. They attack the roots and lower stems of a huge range of plants (see list below) and can be a particularly serious pest of root vegetables and cereals. Attacking the lower stems often results in cutting down seedlings, which is why this species is classed as a cutworm.\n\nThe following is a partial list of genera and other taxa on which the larvae of the turnip moth have been recorded, whether feeding \"in situ\", incidentally, in a laboratory or home breeding situation, or simply having been recorded (perhaps erroneously) in a field of crops. It is striking that the list includes such a sheer variety of plants including resinous, aromatic, and toxic species such as conifers, \"Eucalyptus\", and \"Nicotiana\":\n\nAs with any other noctuid, assorted diseases, predators, and parasitoids attack \"Agrotis segetum\", mainly in the egg and larval stages.\n\nThe insect is not believed to be present in the United States, where the government has been making efforts to prevent its introduction on imported food crops.\n\nCultural methods such as fallowing land before sowing, to starve the larvae can be effective, and in suitable conditions, ploughing land during the dry season to kill larvae and pupae, and expose them to predators, has been effective in maize fields in South Africa. \n\nInsecticides of various kinds have been used with success for many decades. Baits based on sweetened bran, finely spread, have met with some success.\n\nA \"Betabaculovirus\" virus species, \"\"Agrotis segetum\" granulovirus DA\", was first isolated in the USSR in the late 1960s, but despite some research in the 1970s, as of 2017 it has not been found to be commercially viable as a biocontrol for crops.\n\n"}

{"id": "2020264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020264", "title": "Frustration of purpose", "text": "Frustration of purpose\n\nFrustration of purpose, in law, is a defense to enforcement of a contract. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made. Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.\n\nFor example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a hell or high water clause, Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a foreclosure on his credit rating.\n\nFrustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of impossibility. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.\n\nHowever, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.\n\nThe \"Restatement (Second) of Contracts\", Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:\nA circumstance is not deemed to be a \"basic assumption on which the contract is made\" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of Prohibition, when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.\n\nIf the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.\n\nThe English case of \"Taylor v Caldwell\" established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of \"sanctity of contract\". Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a music hall, for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contract, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, Judge Blackburn held that the absolute liability set forth in \"Paradine v Jane\" would not apply here, as there was an implied term that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts. \n\nThe requirement of \"impossibility\" in \"Taylor v Caldwell\" was modified in the 1903 case of \"Krell v Henry\", which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the coronation procession of Edward VII. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for breach of contract; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of \"impossibility\" could not be applied in this case because it was technically possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.\n\nThe Australian case of Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW, The case of Codelfa is a pre-eminent case in Australian law of frustration of a contract, applying a tripartite test, namely, an obligation under the contract is incapable of being performed, without fault of either of the parties (eg, the parties didn't cause the frustrating event to occur), because the circumstances have rendered performance to be radically different.\n\nFrustration will not be recognised if:\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 4, 2004. After Lindsay Naegle forms an anti-children group, Marge fights back with a group led with Mr. Burns' power. It was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Bob Anderson. \n\nThis episode earned Fox ratings of 6.7/10.\n\nWhen Bart and Lisa fight over what to watch on TV, they accidentally change the channel to a show hosted by a children's singer and guitarist named Roofi, a parody of Canadian-Armenian children's singer/songwriter Raffi Cavoukian. This does not appeal to Bart and Lisa, but Maggie adores the show, and after Bart and Lisa accidentally say there is a CD so that they can get the TV back, Marge buys the disc and plays it everywhere, much to the annoyance of Bart, Lisa, and Homer. Marge goes as far as to even buy tickets to the concert, which is to be held at Cletus Spuckler's farm. However, because the concert was oversold, it ends up packed and the Teletubbies are the opening act, dismissed by Marge as repetitive. It starts to rain and Roofi inquires with a man named Steve about the crowd. He then appears on stage to sing \"The Nonsense Song\", but is then hit in the face with a baby bottle, abruptly cuts the show short and gets on a helicopter. After seeing the event on TV, Homer, Lisa and Bart rush to Cletus's farm, but Chief Wiggum warns them to not come in and to leave the job to him and Eddie and Lou. Soon, the babies riot, an event referred to in the news as the \"Tot Offensive\", as reported by Kent Brockman.\n\nIn a response to the disaster, all the adults of Springfield who do not have children (single people, the elderly, couples who do not have children, teenagers, and homosexuals) are up in arms, because Kabul has declared they will no longer be Springfield's sister city and Mayor Quimby forcibly takes $1 million from the audience to cover the damages. Lindsay Naegle arrives to form an anti-youth group named \"Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays Against Parasitic Parents\" (SSCCATAGAPP) to rid the town of anything that provides comfort to families. A statue to America's deadbeat dads is erected, a school bus ignores kids waiting at the stop to take senior citizens on a gambling junket, and a new ordinance allows children who act up in public to be tasered.\n\nA furious Marge lobbies to get an initiative: \"Families Come First\", as she lobbies \"Proud Parents Against Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens, and Gays\" (PPASSCCATAG). Her lobbying efforts do poorly at first, and she fends off a $50,000 offer from America's tobacco lobby, but fair support grows after Mr. Burns loans his signature on Marge's petition because he cares about children (specifically, their \"supple young organs\"). Other Springfield residents follow his lead (as Carl notes, \"Rich guys always want what's best for everyone!\"), and the proposition (Proposition 242) gets on the ballot. Homer tries to help with the campaign but screws up badly by placing the wrong information on bumper stickers and buttons for the voters, while his Rudy Giuliani-featuring advertisement is a disaster and the opposition slanders Marge with an ad where an actress posing as Marge says even she is against Prop 242. Bart and Lisa soon concoct a plan. When everyone goes to the voting polls, they are stopped in their tracks by the (literally) infectious hugs of children. Proposition 242 passes easily, and Homer decides to celebrate by dumping his kids at an R-rated movie with no supervision while he and Marge go some place nice by themselves.\n\nCinemaSentries gave the show a positive review, writing \"\"Marge Vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples and Teens and Gays\" is a great example of the way the show used to be able to find hilarity in mocking both sides of an issue when it spoofs both the grueling life of a parent and the grueling lives of those without children who have to put up with the problems caused by other people's kids.\"\n\n"}

It includes about 35 species found growing in Europe, North Africa, South Africa and Western Asia. They are introduced in the United States.\n\nThey consist of annual plants, biennial plants and perennial plants with the general characteristics of the borage family. They are commonly herbaceous. The leaves are simple or undulate, covered with stiff hairs.\n\nThe small radially symmetrical flowers are sapphire blue and retain their colour a long time. The plants show numerous flowers with 5 sepals, united at their bases, and 5 petals forming a narrow tube facing upwards. The flowers grow in several axillary cymes, simple or branched, or are clustered at the end. The flowers are much frequented by bees.\n\nThe genus \"Anchusa\" is commonly used in trough or rock gardens.\n\nThe roots of \"Anchusa\" (just like those of \"Alkanna\" and \"Lithospermum\") contain anchusin (or alkanet-red ), a red-brown resinoid colouring matter. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol, chloroform and ether.\n\n\"Anchusa\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including \"Coleophora onosmella\".\n\nThere are four subgenera : \"Buglossum\", \"Buglossoides\", \"Buglossellum\" and \"Anchusa\".\n\nThe first two form one subclade, the other two each a separate subclade.

The Busan-Geoje Fixed Link was open in December 2010 and provides a more direct connection to the city of Busan.\n\nGeoje Island covers an area of , the second largest island in South Korea (second to Jeju Island). The landscape features several peaks: Gara (), Gyerong (), the skirmisher mountain (), Daegeum () and Googsabong (). Geojedo is known for its rich deposits of granite. The southern belt of Geojedo, together with part of Namhaedo in Namhae County, belongs to Hallyeo Maritime National Park.\n\nGeoje Island features several natural harbors.

Martinex was born on Cerberus Center, Pluto, although it was later revealed his ancestors were from the continent of Africa on Earth.\n\nHe grew up to become a scientist and technician. Like the other Pluvians, Martinex's body was completely covered by facets that were crystalline in appearance. This design was so that the Pluvians could withstand the extreme temperatures of their world. Martinex could also emit heat and cold from his hands. Martinex became the last surviving Plutonian after the Badoon exterminated all the other Plutonians, as he was working on Pluto's moon Charon. The Pluvians had been forewarned of the attack, but the ship they were escaping on was destroyed by the Badoon. Martinex escaped the Badoon using a telepod and teamed with Vance Astro, a human astronaut from the 20th century with psychic powers, Charlie-27, a Jovian who was the last of his race as well, and Yondu, from Alpha Centauri, to fight the Badoon as the freedom fighters, the Guardians of the Galaxy. It was later revealed Starhawk had manipulated events to bring them together.\n\nThe Guardians later teamed with the time-traveling Thing, Captain America, and Sharon Carter to retake New York City from Badoon forces. Martinex and the Guardians then time-traveled to the 20th Century and met the Defenders. They returned to the future with Starhawk and the Defenders and defeated the Badoon.\n\nEventually, the Guardians drove the Badoon from Earth's solar system and Martinex later became the team's reluctant leader for a time. The Guardians departed post-war Earth on a space mission, and met Nikki who joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, and they visited the Asylum planet. The Guardians then teamed with a time-traveling Thor, and battled Korvac and his Minions of Menace. Martinex and the Guardians traveled to the present era, and assisted the Avengers in battle against Korvac. He attended an Avengers membership meeting but left soon afterwards.\n\nWhile looking for the shield of Captain America, the Guardians came into conflict with Taserface and the Stark. They also encountered Firelord and defeated the Stark. The Guardians then battled a team of superhumans known as Force, and Martinex was mortally injured by the member of Force known as Brawl. Much of the crystals that covered Martinex's body were shattered, but Martinex recovered with the help of fellow Guardian Starhawk. All of the exterior crystals on Martinex fell away, leaving Martinex with a new crystalline appearance, one that was less faceted, and somewhat purple in tone. The Guardians then located Haven, a lost colony of Earth founded by mutants, where they battled Rancor and her lieutenants. Martinex later met the Spirit of Vengeance.\n\nEventually, Martinex left the team to form a larger version of the Guardians, known as the Galactic Guardians. This team was summoned to help rescue an imperiled planet full of innocents. The Galactic Guardians were initially made up of alternate future versions of Wonder Man, Firelord, the Vision, Phoenix, and Ghost Rider. They had further adventures in their own limited series. Martinex later returns to the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nMartinex is a member of a genetically engineered offshoot of humanity whose traits were designed for survival under the cold conditions of the dwarf planet Pluto. He possesses enhanced strength, speed, and stamina, and superhuman durability. His epidermis is composed of a silicon-isotope organic crystal. Martinex has the ability to convert bodily energy into laser-like beams of energy which he can project from his hands. His right hand can project infrared energy, stimulating heat in any object. His left hand can project microwave energy that reduces thermal energies in objects, thereby producing coldness. His body is highly resistant to intense heat and cold as well as other conventional forms of injury. Martinex can only use his superhuman powers to project heat and cold at maximum output for up to one half-hour before having to rest in order to replenish them.\n\nMartinex has earned doctorates in physics and engineering. He possesses expertise in various areas of 31st Century technology, including computers and cyborg design.\n\nMartinex appears in \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\", portrayed by Michael Rosenbaum. He is a member of Stakar Ogord's team of Ravagers. Martinex visits Yondu on Contraxia along with his leader to remind him that he is in exile for breaking the Ravagers' code. After Yondu sacrifices himself to save Peter Quill, Martinex and Stakar are moved by his sacrifice when he and the other Ravagers attend his funeral. The two of them decide to bring the rest of the team back together to honor him as seen in the mid-credits scene.\n\n"}

In the gubernatorial elections on August 29, 2004 he won with 40% of the votes. He was re-elected on October 6, 2008, in the gubernatorial elections with 45% of the vote, but he resigned a month later after being indicted on charges of corruption.\n\nAfterward the resignation Mr. Apirak became an advisor to Prime Minister of Thailand, Mr. Abhisit Vejjajiva. In December 2010, he became the 2nd Bangkok district Member of Parliament, with 69% of the vote. After the 2011 National Election, Mr. Apirak became the 8th Party-list MP of the Democrats Party of Thailand. He also became the deputy-leader of the Party and the Shadow Minister of Commerce.\n\nBorn in Nonthaburi in a Thai Chinese family, he studied at Triam Udom Suksa School and Chiang Mai University, where he received a bachelor's degree in Food Science and Technology in 1983. Beginning his professional career at the Thai branch of Pizza Hut, he worked at several companies as manager and director. 2002–2004 he was among other posts CEO of TA Orange (currently known as True Move) and member of the Board of Directors of the Stock Exchange of Thailand.\n\nIn 2004 the Democratic Party nominated him as their candidate for the Bangkok governor election, which he won gaining 40% of all votes. Paveena Hongsakul, an independent candidate with the unofficial support of the ruling Thai Rak Thai party, came in second-place with 16% of the vote.\n\nCritics have noted the lack of tangible impact Apirak had in his role as city governor. Some policies, for instance \"smart\" traffic signs and bus stops flopped and his Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project has yet to come into service. However, he was lauded for being able to push the extension of BTS Skytrain routes, which are currently under construction. Another notable project Apirak was successful in implementing is the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre at Pathumwan intersection which opened in 2008.\nAfter two years in office, poll respondents gave him high marks for diligence and dedication to work. But he received his lowest marks for seeing projects through to completion. His traffic and transport initiatives also received flunking marks. Overall, 57% of Bangkokians felt he had met expectations.\n\nApirak's so-called smart taxi stops were met with derision. The 150 stops that were in operation by October 2005 looked like bus stops. If people were waiting, a red light became visible to nearby cabs. If no taxis passed by, would-be passengers could press a button and a call centre would direct cabs to the stand. A BMA study found the stops had a success rate of only 38.6%. Although 189,549 smart taxis had been hailed, the study showed that only 73,168 stopped to pick up passengers. Many stops stood empty and unused. However, Apirak's smart traffic signs have been a mild success, giving motorists more information about traffic conditions ahead and is mild relief from the stress of driving in the city.\n\nThe military junta's Assets Examination Committee (AEC) did not charge Apirak over the controversial purchase of fire-fighting equipment for the city. Sithichok Rawdkrutha, an AEC member, lodged a complaint with AEC Chairman Nam Yimyaem over the decision and noted that he suspected Apirak of dereliction of duty or malfeasance for giving the nod to the purchase, for which he allegedly received 500 million baht in kickbacks. Apirak has protested his innocence by pointing to the fact that the deal was originally signed by the former Bangkok governor Samak Sundaravej. Apirak claims to have been forced by the ex-governor's agreement to continue the project.\n\nDespite the hanging allegations Apirak won re-election on the October 5, 2008 with 45% of the vote or 991,018 of the votes cast.\n\n\nOn November 11, 2008 the National Counter Corruption Commission announced that Apirak was indicted together with other officials including former Governor and Prime Minister Samak. On the 13 Apirak announced in front of television cameras his resignation saying: \"Like the Democrat Party, I support a move that will perpetuate politics-for-people,\" he continued \"I have complete confidence in my innocence. I am ready to see my case go through the judicial system. I am confident that I will receive justice in the end,\". Abhisit Vejjajiva Leader of the Democrat party was quoted saying: \"Apirak's decision set a standard many people want to see in Thai politics. It's praiseworthy and he deserves moral support from society,\" His resignation immediately set out a by-election for the next governor. Currently he is a close adviser to PM Abhisit Vejjajiva.\n\nThen on September 10, 2013, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Person Holding Political Position ruled that Mr.Apirak is found not guilty, on the ground that Mr.Apirak had followed all the procedure stated in the contract which came into force before he came into the office. Afterward he re-negotiated with the contractor and was able to save Bangkok Administration in the amount of 250 million bahts.\n\nAfter his resignation from the Bangkok Governor position, Mr. Apirak became the advisor to Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, from Democrats Party of Thailand. He played an important part in many policies, such as relieving the Thai economic during the 2008-2012 global recessions, “Moving Thailand Forward” project, decentralizing power to the local offices and government, Creative Economy project, and push forward the “Social Enterprise” businesses. Moreover, Mr. Apirak was entrusted by the Prime Minister to relieve the flood and political unrest victims in 2010.\n\nIn December 2010, Mr. Apirak ran for the seat of district 2 Bangkok MP (Member of the Parliament) for the Democrats Party of Thailand. As a result, Mr. Apirak won with 71,072 votes (68.67% of the voter turnout) on December 12, 2010.\n\nPrime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolved the Parliament in May 2011, which leads to a National-wide election in Thailand. As a deputy-leader of Democrats Party of Thailand, Mr. Apirak was entrusted by the party to overlook the election campaign in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. Although the election result ended with a victory for the Pheu Thai Party (265-159) national wide, Democrats Party of Thailand had a successful campaign in Bangkok with a victory of 23-10.\n\nMr. Apirak became the 8th Party-list MP of the Democrats Party of Thailand. He was also reelected by the Party’s members to become a deputy leader of the Party. Once the Shadow Cabinet is formed by Democrats Party of Thailand, Mr. Apirak is appointed as the Shadow Minister of Commerce, mainly overseeing the cost of living and consumer economy of the people.\n\nIn September–December 2011, Thailand faced the worst flood crisis in its history with 65 provinces and 16 million people were affected, along with 815 fatalities. Mr. Apirak and Democrats Party of Thailand, with the help of Seni Pramoj Foundation, set up Asa-Thai (Thai volunteer) group to help aid and relieve the flood victims all over the country. By the end of the Flood Crisis, Asa-Thai was able to send aid to 31 provinces with 130,000 relief bags, 4,500,000 meal boxes, set up 2 emergency shelters for the victims, etc.\n\nOn March 3, 2013 he participated at the 2013 Bangkok governor election.\n\n"}

Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's \"Morning Journal\" under the title \"Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses\", as documented by the Fondazione Barsanti e Matteucci.\n\nBarsanti was born in Pietrasanta, Tuscany. Lean and short of stature, he studied in a Catholic scientific-oriented institute near Lucca, in Tuscany, and became entered the novitiate of the Piarist Fathers or Scolopi, who were known for being open to scientific study, in Florence in 1838.\n\nIn 1841 Barsanti began teaching in the \"Collegio San Michele\", situated in Volterra. Here, during a lecture describing the explosion of mixed hydrogen and air, he realised the potential for using the energy of the expansion of combusting gases within a motor.\n\nSubsequently, when teaching in a college level institute in Florence he met Matteucci. Matteucci appreciated the idea for the engine, and the two men worked together on it for the rest of their lives.\n\nOn 12 June 1854, they patented their invention in London, as Italian law at that time could not guarantee sufficient international protection on the patent. The construction of the prototype was later completed in the 1860s.\n\nThe main advantage of the Barsanti-Matteucci engine was the use of the return force of the piston due to the cooling of the gas. Other approaches based on the pushing force of the explosion, like the one developed by France's Etienne Lenoir, were slower. The Barsanti-Matteucci engine was proven to be much more efficient, and won a silver medal from the institute of science of Lombardy.\n\nIn 1856, Barsanti and Matteucci developed a two-cylinder 5 HP motor and two years later they built a counter-working two-piston engine.\n\nBarsanti thought the new engine was a great improvement over the steam engine; it was much safer and less cumbersome and quick to operate. The main target was to provide mechanical energy in factories and for naval propulsion. It was not light enough for use as automotive engine.\n\nAfter some searching, Barsanti and Matteucci selected the John Cockerill foundry in Seraing, Belgium to mass-produce a engine. Orders for soon followed from many countries within Europe.\n\nBarsanti died suddenly at Seraing of typhoid fever, on 30 March 1864, and Matteucci was left alone to lead the business. The development of the engine failed and Matteucci returned to his first occupation, hydraulics.\n\nWhen Nicolaus Otto patented his engine, Matteucci unsuccessfully argued he and his partner Barsanti were the originators.\n\nMany documents concerning the patents of Barsanti and Matteucci’s motor are preserved in the archive of the Museo Galileo library in Florence.\n\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U-FqWbUcJA&list=UUAYtXHKyo-oFMd5garmMG2w\n\n"}

The college campus incorporates 235 acres, which includes academic buildings, residence halls, the student activity and recreation center, an indoor swimming facility, ropes course, walking trail, outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, athletic fields and racquetball courts.\n\nGordon State College was founded in 1852 as the Male and Female Seminary, a private school for higher education of boys and girls. Though church-sponsored, it was not a seminary in the usual sense. During the American Civil War, boys were organized into a corps of cadets. Girls continued to attend but were never included in military programs.\n\nIn 1872, the school was renamed Gordon Institute to honor Georgia native, governor and former CSA General John B. Gordon, and its scope was extended to the elementary grades. In 1890, J.C. Woodward, who later founded Georgia Military Academy, was hired to start a military program.\n\nIn 1907, the name changed to Gordon College. In 1916 the U.S. Department of War named Gordon College a junior military unit. In 1928, Gordon added the first two years of college to its program. In 1933 the state offered the former Georgia Industrial College campus to Gordon College. The high school and junior college departments moved to the new campus, while the elementary school moved into the former high school building. Gordon College was known as Gordon Military College from the mid-1930s until 1972.\n\nIn the 1950s, ownership of the school passed to the city of Barnesville, which consolidated its government-funded public schools for whites in grades 8-12, while continuing to bus black students to racially segregated Lamar County schools. City girls were enrolled as regular students. City boys were permitted to opt out of military participation, but almost all were organized into a corps of cadets under military discipline. Military cadets from other places were permitted to enroll by paying tuition; many attracted by low tuition rates came from Latin America, including Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican migration to New York.\n\nGordon State experienced financial problems in the 1960s, and in 1970 the trustees approached the state about making the college part of the university system. The secondary school was separated and the cadet corps disbanded, and on July 2, 1972, Gordon Military College officially became part of the University System of Georgia as Gordon Junior College, an associate-level college. In 1986 \"junior\" was dropped from the school's name.\n\nIn 2006, the school was designated a four-year state college and now offers 10 bachelor's degree programs.\n\nOn August 8, 2012, the Board of Regents approved the change of the name of Gordon College to Gordon State College. The action follows the board's approval in 2006 of a change in status for the two-year college in Barnesville to allow it to offer baccalaureate programs within the University System's state college sector.\n\nGordon State College offers bachelor's degrees and Associate of Arts degrees as well as an Associate of Science degree in nursing.\n\nGordon State College competes in Region XVII of the Georgia College Athletic Association and the National Junior College Athletic Association. The college has teams in women's soccer and softball, men's baseball and basketball. \n\nThere are also a variety of intramural sports. \n\nBefore the 1980s, the athletic teams at Gordon State were the Bulldogs. Through the mid-1980s, Gordon State's teams were known as the Generals, a nod to General Gordon. The teams are now called the Highlanders. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020378", "title": "Tennis scoring system", "text": "Tennis scoring system\n\nThe tennis scoring system is a way to keep track of tennis matches (including pick-up games). Some tennis matches are played as part of a tournament. (Tournaments may have various categories, such as singles and doubles.) The great majority are organised as a single-elimination tournament, with competitors being eliminated after a single loss, and the overall winner being the last competitor without a loss. Optimally, such tournaments have a number of competitors equal to a power of two in order to fully fill out a single elimination bracket. In many professional and top-level amateur events, the brackets are seeded according to a recognised ranking system, in order to keep the best players in the field from facing each other until as late in the tournament as possible; additionally, if byes are necessary because of a less-than-full bracket, those byes in the first round are usually given to the highest-seeded competitors.\n\nA tennis match is composed of points, games, and sets. A set consists of a number of games (a minimum of six), which in turn each consist of points. A set is won by the first side to win 6 games, with a margin of at least 2 games over the other side (e.g. 6–3 or 7–5). If the set is tied at six games each, a tie-break is usually played to decide the set. A match is won when a player or a doubles team has won the majority of the prescribed number of sets. Matches employ either a best-of-three (first to two sets wins) or best-of-five (first to three sets wins) set format. The best-of-five set format is usually only used in the men's singles or doubles matches at Grand Slam and Davis Cup matches.\n\nA game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving, and is won by the first side to have won at least four points with a margin of two points or more over their opponent. Normally the server's score is always called first and the receiver's score second. Score calling in tennis is unusual in that (except in tie-breaks) each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value. The current point score is announced orally before each point by the judge, or by the server if there is no judge.\n\nFor instance, if the server has won three points so far in the game, and the non-server has won one, the score is \"40–15\".\n\nWhen both sides have won the same number of points within a given game—i.e., when each side has won one, or two, points—the score is described as \"15–all\" and \"30–all\" (or \"15–up\" and \"30–up\"), respectively. However, if each player has won three points, the score is called as \"deuce\", not \"40–all\". From that point on in the game, whenever the score is tied, it is described as \"deuce\" regardless of how many points have been played.\n\nIn standard play, scoring beyond a \"deuce\" score, in which both players have scored three points each, requires that one player must get two points ahead in order to win the game. This type of tennis scoring is known as \"advantage scoring\" (or \"ads\"). The side which wins the next point after deuce is said to have the advantage. If they lose the next point, the score is again deuce, since the score is tied. If the side with the advantage wins the next point, that side has won the game, since they have a lead of two points. When the server is the player with the advantage, the score may be called as \"advantage in\". When the server's opponent has the advantage, the score may be called as \"advantage out\". These phrases are sometimes shortened to \"ad in\" or \"van in\" (or \"my ad\") and \"ad out\" (or \"your ad\"). Alternatively, the players' names are used: in professional tournaments the umpire announces the score in this format (e.g. \"advantage Nadal\" or \"advantage Williams\").\n\nIn the USTA rule book (but not the ITF rules), there is the following comment: “ ‘Zero,’ ’one,’ ’two,’ and ’three,’ may be substituted for ’Love,’ ’15,’ ’30,’ and ’40.’ ” This is particularly appropriate for matches with an inexperienced player or in which one player does not understand English.’\n\nFor tie-breaks, the calls are simply the number of points won by each player.\n\nThe origins of the 15, 30, and 40 scores are believed to be medieval French. The earliest reference is in a ballad by Charles D'Orleans in 1435 which refers to \"quarante cinque\" (\"forty-five\"), which gave rise to modern 40. In 1522, there is a sentence in Latin \"we are winning 30, we are winning 45\". The first recorded theories about the origin of 15 were published in 1555 and 1579. However, the origins of this convention remain obscure.\nIt is sometimes believed that clock faces were used to keep score on court, with a quarter move of the minute hand to indicate a score of 15, 30, and 45. When the hand moved to 60, the game was over. However, in order to ensure that the game could not be won by a one-point difference in players' scores, the idea of \"\"deuce\"\" was introduced. To make the score stay within the \"60\" ticks on the clock face, the 45 was changed to 40. Therefore, if both players had 40, the first player to score would receive ten, and that would move the clock to 50. If the player scored a second time before the opponent is able to score, they would be awarded another ten and the clock would move to 60. The 60 signifies the end of the game. However, if a player fails to score twice in a row, then the clock would move back to 40 to establish another \"\"deuce\"\".\n\nAlthough this suggestion might sound attractive, the first reference to tennis scoring (as mentioned above) is in the 15th century, and at that time clocks measured only the hours (1 to 12). It was not until about 1690, when the more accurate pendulum escapement was invented, that clocks regularly had minute hands. So the concept of tennis scores originating from the clock face could not have come from medieval times.\n\nAnother theory is that the scoring nomenclature came from the French game \"jeu de paume\" (a precursor to tennis which initially used the hand instead of a racket). Jeu de paume was very popular before the French Revolution, with more than 1,000 courts in Paris alone. The traditional court was 90 feet (\"pieds du roi\") in length with 45 feet on each side. When the server scored, he or she moved forward 15 feet. If the server scored again, he or she would move another 15 feet. If the server scored a third time, he or she could only move 10 feet closer.\n\nThe origin of the use of \"love\" for zero is also disputed. The most likely explanation is that it derives from the French expression for \"the egg\" (\"l'œuf\") because an egg looks like the number zero. This is similar to the origin of the term \"duck\" in cricket, supposedly from \"duck's egg\", referring to a batsman who has been called out without scoring a run. Another possibility comes from the Dutch expression \"iets voor lof doen\", which means to do something for praise, implying no monetary stakes. Another theory on the origins of the use of \"love\" comes from the notion that, at the start of any match, when scores are at zero, players still have \"love for each other\".\n\nA popular alternative to advantage scoring is \"no-advantage\" (or \"no-ad\") scoring, created by James Van Alen in order to shorten match playing time. No-advantage scoring is a scoring method in which the first player to reach four points wins the game. No-ad scoring eliminates the requirement that a player must win by two points. Therefore, if the game is tied at deuce, the next player to win a point wins the game. This method of scoring is used in most World TeamTennis matches. When this style of play is implemented, at deuce, the receiver then chooses from which side of the court he or she desires to return the serve. However, in no-ad mixed doubles play, each gender always serves to the same gender at game point and during the final point of tiebreaks.\n\nIn tennis, a set consists of a sequence of games played with alternating service and return roles. There are two types of set formats that require different types of scoring.\n\nAn \"advantage set\" is played until a player or team has won at least 6 games and that player or team has a 2-game lead over their opponent(s). The set continues, without tiebreak(er), until a player or team wins the set by 2 games. Advantage sets are no longer played under the rules of the United States Tennis Association, nor in the Australian Open starting from 2019; however, they are still used in the final sets in men's and women's singles in the French Open and Fed Cup. Wimbledon uses a unique scoring system for the last set where the players continue to play after 6–6 as in an advantage set until a player earns a 2-game lead. However, if the players reach 12–12, a 7-point tie-breaker is played to determine the winner. Mixed doubles at the Grand Slams (except for Wimbledon) are a best-of-three format with the final set being played as a \"Super Tie Break\" (sometimes referred to as a \"best of two\" format) except at Wimbledon, which still plays a best-of-three match with the final set played as an advantage set and the first two played as tie-break sets.\n\nA \"tie-break set\" is played with the same rules as the advantage set, except that when the score is tied at 6–6, a tie-break game (or tiebreaker) is played. Typically, the tie-break game continues until one side has won seven points with a margin of two or more points. However, many tie-break games are played with different tiebreak point requirements, such as 8 or 10 points. Often, a 7-point tie-breaker is played when the set score is tied at 6–6 to determine who wins the set. If the tiebreak score gets to 6–6, then whichever player to win the best of two points wins the set.\n\nThe score of games within a set is counted in the ordinary manner, except that when a player or team has a score of no games it is read as \"love\". The score is written using digits separated by a dash. This score is announced by the judge or server at the start of each game.\n\nIn doubles, service alternates between the teams. One player serves for an entire service game, with that player's partner serving for the entirety of the team's next service game. Players of the receiving team receive the serve on alternating points, with each player of the receiving team declaring which side of the court (deuce or ad side) they will receive serve on for the duration of the set. Teams alternate service games every game.\n\n\"Advantage sets\" sometimes continue much longer than \"tie-break sets\". The 2010 Wimbledon first-round match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut, which is the longest professional tennis match in history, notably ended with Isner winning the fifth set by 70–68. The match lasted in total 11 hours and five minutes, with the fifth set alone lasting eight hours, 11 minutes. Whoever wins by a margin of two wins the set, but this could take a very long time to finish.\n\nNevertheless, even tie-break sets can last a long time. For instance, once players reach 6–6 set score and also reach 6–6 tiebreaker score, play must continue until one player has a 2-point advantage, which can take a considerable time. Sets decided by tiebreakers, however, are typically significantly shorter than extended advantage sets.\n\nThe set is won by the first player (or team) to have won at least six games and at least two games more than his or her opponent. Traditionally, sets would be played until both these criteria had been met, with no maximum number of games. To shorten matches, James Van Alen created a tie-breaker system, which was widely introduced in the early 1970s. If the score reaches 6–5 (or 5–6), one further game is played. If the leading player wins this game, the set is won 7–5 (or 5–7). If the trailing player wins the game, the score is tied at 6–6 and a special tiebreaker game is played. The winner of the tiebreak wins the set by a score of 7–6 (or 6–7).\n\nThe tiebreak is sometimes not employed for the final set of a match and an advantage set is used instead. Therefore, the deciding set must be played until one player or team has won two more games than the opponent. Of the major tennis championships, this now only applies in the French Open. In the US Open, a tiebreak is played in the deciding set (fifth set for the men, third set for the women) at 6–6. Starting in 2019, in Wimbledon, a tiebreak will be played if the score reaches 12–12 in the final set. In the Australian Open, a \"first to 10\" tiebreak is played in the deciding set if it reaches 6–6. (When the tiebreak was first introduced at Wimbledon in 1971, it was invoked at 8–8 rather than 6–6.) The US Open formerly held \"Super Saturday\" where the two men's semi-finals were played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event; therefore a tie-break was more prudent where player rest and scheduling is more important.\n\nAt a score of 6–6, a set is often determined by one more game called a \"twelve point tiebreaker\" (or just \"tiebreak\"). Only one more game is played to determine the winner of the set; the score of the resulting completed set is 7–6 or 6–7 (though it can be 6–6 if a player retires before completion).\n\nPoints are counted using ordinary numbering. The set is won by the player who has scored at least seven points in the tiebreak and at least two points more than their opponent. For example, if the score is 6 points to 5 and the player with 6 points wins the next point, they win the tiebreak (7 points to 5), as well as the set (7 games to 6). If the player with 5 points wins the point instead (for a score of 6–6), the tiebreak continues and cannot be won on the next point (7–6 or 6–7), since no player will be two points ahead. In the scoring of the set, sometimes the tiebreak points are shown as well as the game count, e.g., 7–6. Another way of listing the score of the tiebreak is to list only the loser's points. For example, if the set score is listed as 7–6, the tiebreak score was 10–8 (since the 8 is the loser's score, and the winner must win by two points). Similarly, 7–6 means the tiebreak score was 7–3.\n\nThe player who would normally be serving after 6–6 is the one to serve first in the tiebreak, and the tiebreak is considered a service game for this player. The server begins his or her service from the deuce court and serves one point. After the first point, the serve changes to the first server's opponent. Each player then serves two consecutive points for the remainder of the tiebreak. The first of each two-point sequence starts from the server's advantage court and the second starts from the deuce court. In this way, the sum of the scores is even when the server serves from the deuce court. After every six points, the players switch ends of the court; note that the side-changes during the tiebreak will occur in the middle of a server's two-point sequence. At the end of the tiebreak, the players switch ends of the court again, since the set score is always odd (13 games).\n\nAn alternative tie-break system called the \"Coman Tie-Break\" is sometimes used by the United States Tennis Association. Scoring is the same, but end changes take place after the first point and then after every four points. This approach allows the servers of doubles teams to continue serving from the same end of the court as during the body of the set. It also reduces the advantage the elements (e.g. wind and sun) could give playing the first six points of a seven-point tiebreak on one side of the court.\n\nThe French open is the only Grand Slam or professional tournament where in the fifth set at 6-6 a tiebreak is not played and rather games are continued to be played out until a 2 game lead occurs. \n\nThe tiebreaker – more recently shortened to just \"tiebreak\", though both terms are still used interchangeably – was invented by James Van Alen and unveiled in 1965 as an experiment at the pro tournament he sponsored at Newport Casino, Rhode Island, after an earlier, unsuccessful attempt to speed up the game by the use of his so-called \"Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System\" (\"VASSS\"). For two years before the Open Era, in 1955 and 1956, the United States Pro Championship in Cleveland, Ohio, was played by VASSS rules. The scoring was the same as that in table tennis, with sets played to 21 points and players alternating five services, with no second service. The rules were created partially to limit the effectiveness of the powerful service of the reigning professional champion, Pancho Gonzales. Even with the new rules, however, Gonzales beat Pancho Segura in the finals of both tournaments. Even though the 1955 match went to 5 sets, with Gonzales barely holding on to win the last one 21–19, it is reported to have taken 47 minutes to complete. The fans attending the matches preferred the traditional rules, however, and in 1957 the tournament reverted to the old method of scoring.\n\nVan Alen called his innovation a \"tiebreaker\", and he actually proposed two different kinds or versions of it: \"best-five-of-nine-points tiebreaker\" and \"best-seven-of-12-points tiebreaker\". The first lasts a maximum of 9 points, and awards victory in the set to whichever player or team first reaches 5 points – even if the other player or team already has 4; the margin of victory can be a single point. Because this \"9-point\" tiebreaker \"must\" end after a maximum of 9 points, even if neither player or team has a 2-point (or greater) margin, Van Alen also called it a \"sudden-death tiebreaker\" (If and when the score reached four points all, both players faced simultaneous set point and/or match point.). This type of tiebreaker had its Grand Slam debut at 1970 US Open and was employed there until 1974. Apart from being used for 5 years at US Open it was also used 1 year at Wimbledon and for a while on the Virginia Slims circuit and in American Colleges.\n\nThe other type of tiebreaker Van Alen introduced is the \"12-point\" tiebreaker that is most familiar and widely used today. Because it ends as soon as either player or team reaches 7 points – provided that that player or team leads the other at that point by \"at least\" two points – it \"can\" actually be over in as few as 7 points. However, because the winning player or team \"must\" win by a margin of at least two points, a \"12-point\" tiebreaker may go beyond 12 points – sometimes well beyond. That is why Van Alen derisively likened it to a \"lingering death\", in contrast to the 9-point (or fewer) \"sudden-death tiebreaker\" that he recommended and preferred.\n\nThe impetus to use \"some\" kind of a tie-breaking procedure gained force after a monumental 1969 struggle at Wimbledon between Pancho Gonzales and Charlie Pasarell. This was a 5-set match that lasted five hours and 12 minutes and took 2 days to complete. In the fifth set the 41-year-old Gonzales won all seven match points that Pasarell had against him, twice coming back from 0–40 deficits. The final score was 22–24, 1–6, 16–14, 6–3, 11–9 for Gonzales.\n\nThe tiebreaker gave tennis a definite \"finish line\".\n\nIn 1971, the nine-point tiebreaker was introduced at Wimbledon (the first scoring change at Wimbledon in 94 years).\n\nIn 1972, Wimbledon put into effect a 12-point tiebreaker when the score in a set reached 8–8 in games unless the set was such that one of the players could achieve a match victory by winning it.\n\nIn 1979, Wimbledon changed their rules so that a (12-point) tiebreak would be played once any set except the final set reached 6–6 in games.\n\nIn 1989, the Davis Cup adopted the tie-break in all sets except for the final set, and then extended it to the final set starting in 2016.\n\nIn 2001, the Australian Open replaced the deciding third set of mixed doubles with an eighteen-point \"match tiebreak\" (first to ten points and win by two points wins the match). Despite some criticism of the change by fans and former pros, the US Open (from 2003) and the French Open (from 2007) have followed the Australian Open in using the same format for mixed doubles. Wimbledon continues to play a traditional best of three match, with a tie-break in the final set at 12–12 (advantage set was played before 2019).\n\nTie-break sets are now nearly universal in all levels of play, for all sets in a match; however, the tie-break is not a compulsory element in any set, and the actual formatting of sets and tie-breaks depends on the tournament director in tournaments, and, in private matches, on the players' agreement before play begins. Currently, the French Open is the only tournament to not use a tie-break for the deciding set in singles. Tie-breaks were not used in the final set in the Australian Open for singles before 2019, Wimbledon before 2019, or the Fed Cup before 2019, nor were they used for final sets in Davis Cup play or the Olympics before 2016. The US Open has used a tiebreak in the final set, both in singles and in doubles, since 1970, and was the only major tournament to use a tiebreak in the final set for singles before 2019. However, the Australian Open and French Open do use a final set tiebreak in both men's and women's doubles.\n\nAfter criticism of two lengthy semifinals in the 2018 Men's Singles, Wimbledon announced the 2019 Championships would use final-set tiebreaks if the score reaches 12 games all. The first such was in the Men's Doubles third round, with Henri Kontinen and John Peers defeating Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury.\n\nShortly following Wimbledon's final set tiebreak introduction announcement, the Australian Open also for their 2019 tournament has now introduced a \"super-tiebreak\" at 6-6 for both singles and doubles (but not mixed doubles) in the final set, replacing the previous format in which the final set would continue until one player was ahead by two games. The new format for the final set is similar to the \"12-point tiebreaker\", but with the winner being the first to 10 points instead of 7 (and they must still win by 2 points). Tennis Australia has called this a \"10-point tiebreak\", though this is inconsistent with the reasoning behind the naming of the \"12-point tiebreaker\", which represents the minimum total number of points (a score of 7–5); the same reasoning would make the new format an \"18-point tiebreaker\" with a minimum winning score of 10–8.\n\n, the French Open remains the only one among the grand slam tournaments that does not utilize any form of a tie-break for singles in the final set; each of the four grand slam tournaments have now effectively adopted different rules governing how the final set for singles will be concluded in close matches.\n\nWhile traditional sets continue until a player wins at least six games by a margin of at least two games there are some alternative set scoring formats in use. A common alternative set format is the eight or nine game pro set. Instead of playing until one player reaches six games with a margin of two games, one plays until one player wins eight or nine games with a margin of two games. A tie-break is then played at eight or nine games all. While the format is not used in modern professional matches or recognized by the ITF rules, it was supposedly used in early professional tours. It is commonly utilized in various amateur leagues and high school tennis as a shorter alternative to a best of three match, but longer than a traditional tie-break set. In addition, eight game pro sets were used during doubles for all Division I college dual matches, until the 2014–2015 season.\n\nAnother alternative set format are so called \"short sets\" where the first to four games to win by two games. In this format a tie-break is played at four games all. The ITF experimented with this format in low level Davis Cup matches, but the experiment was not continued. Nevertheless, this alternative remains as an acceptable alternative in the ITF rules of Tennis.\n\nAnother alternative set format is seen in World Team Tennis where the winner of a set is the first to win five games and a nine-point tie-break is played at 4–4.\n\nAn alternative to Tennis Australia's Fast4 shorter scoring method is Thirty30 tennis where every game starts at 30–30. Thirty30 (T30) is a shortened format of tennis and can be described as the tennis equivalent of the Twenty20 (T20) format of cricket. Sets are rather short: One set is generally played in 20 minutes.\n\nThe winner is the side that wins more than half of the sets, and the match ends as soon as this is achieved. Men's matches may be the best of either three or five sets, while women's and mixed doubles matches are usually best of three sets.\n\nThe alternation of service between games continues throughout the match without regard to sets, but the ends are changed after each odd game within a set (including the last game). If, for example, the second set of a match ends with the score at 6–3, 1–6, the ends are changed as the last game played was the 7th (odd) game of the set and in spite of it being the 16th (even) game of the match. Even when a set ends with an odd game, ends are again changed after the first game of the following set. A tiebreaker game is treated as a single game for the purposes of this alternation. Since tiebreakers always result in a score of 7–6, there is always a court change after the tiebreaker.\n\nThe score of a complete match may be given simply by sets won, or with the scores in each set given separately. In either case, the match winner's score is stated first. In the former, shorter form, a match might be listed as 3–1 (i.e. three sets to one). In the latter form, this same match might be further described as \"7–5, 6–7, 6–4, 7–6\". (As noted above, an alternate form of writing the tiebreak score lists only the loser's scoree.g., \"7–6\" for the fourth set in the example.) This match was won three sets to one, with the match loser winning the second set on a tiebreaker. The numbers in parentheses, normally included in printed scorelines but omitted when spoken, indicate the duration of the tiebreaker following a given set. Here, the match winner lost the second-set tiebreaker 7–4 and won the fourth-set tiebreaker 8–6.\n\nBecause tennis is scored set by set and game by game, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of points and/or games played.\n\nConsider a player who wins six games in each of two sets, all by a score of game–30. The winner has scored 4×12 = 48 points and the loser 2×12 = 24. Suppose also that the loser wins four games in each set, all by a score of game-love. The loser has scored 4×8 = 32 points and the winner zero in those games. The final score is a win by 6–4, 6–4; total points 48–56.\n\nAn example of this in actual practice was the record-breaking Isner-Mahut match in the Wimbledon first round, 22–24 June 2010. American John Isner beat Nicolas Mahut of France 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68 – Mahut winning a total of 502 points to Isner's 478.\n\nLikewise, a player may lose a match despite winning the majority of games played (or win a match despite losing the majority of games). Roger Federer won the 2009 Wimbledon final over Andy Roddick (5–7, 7–6, 7–6, 3–6, 16–14) despite Roddick's winning more games (39, versus Federer's 38). Roger Federer also lost the 2019 Wimbledon final, despite winning more games (and in fact more points as well) than Novak Djokovic.\n\nWhen playing a match, it is usually best to report each score out loud with one's opponent to avoid conflicts. During a game, the server has the responsibility to announce the game score before serving. This is done by announcing the server's score first. If, for example, the server loses the first three points of his or her service game, he or she would say \"love–40\". This is to be done every time. After a set is complete, the server, before serving for the first game of the next set, announces the set scores so far completed in the match, stating his or her own scores first. If the server has won the first two sets and is beginning the third, he or she would say, \"two–love, new set.\" If the server had lost the first two sets, he or she would say, \"love–two, new set.\" Finally, after the completion of the match, either player, when asked the score, announces his or her own scores first.\n\nAs an example, consider a match between Victoria Azarenka and Ana Ivanovic. Azarenka wins the first set 6–4, Ivanovic wins the next set 7–6 (winning the tie break 7–4), and Azarenka wins the final set 6–0.\n\nAt the end of each set, the umpire would announce the winner of each set:\n\nAt the completion of the match, the result would be announced as:\n\nThe result would be written as:\n\nThe score is always written and announced in respect to the winner of the match. The score of the tiebreak is not included in announcing the final result; it is simply said \"seven–six\" or \"six–seven\" regardless of the score in the tiebreak.\n\nIf a match ends prematurely due to one player retiring or being disqualified (defaulting), the partial score at that point is announced as the final score, with the remaining player as the nominal winner. For instance, the result in the final of the 2012 Aegon Championships was written and announced as follows:\n\nDuring informal play of tennis, especially at tennis clubs in the U.S. (also in other English speaking countries), score announcements are frequently shortened with the use of abbreviations. For example, a score 15 is replaced with \"five\", or in some cases \"fif\". \"Love\" is often substituted to indicate \"zero\". Similarly, the scores of 30 and 40 may sometimes be spoken as \"three\" or \"four\" respectively. A score of 15-all may sometimes be announced as \"fives.\" To further confuse score announcements, a score of 30-all (30–30) may often be called \"deuce\", and the following point referred to as \"ad in\" or \"ad out\" (or \"my ad\" or \"your ad\"), depending on which player (or team) won the point. The logic for this is that a 30-all score is \"effectively\" the same as deuce (40–40).\n\nFor formal scorekeeping, the official scoring the match (e.g. the chair umpire) fills out a scorecard, either on paper or electronically. The scorecard allows the official to record details for each point, as well as rule violations and other match information. Standard markings for each point are:\n\n\nAn additional dot is marked in a score box to indicate a missed first serve fault.\n\n"}

Levin is known for his involvement in brokering the merger between AOL and Time Warner in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, a merger which seemed to many to be disadvantageous to Time Warner as the bubble collapsed in the next few years.\n\nLevin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a Jewish family of Russian and Romanian origins. His father was a butter-and-egg businessman and his mother was a piano teacher. He lived as a child in Overbrook Hills, a suburb of Philadelphia. He attended Haverford College, where he is a member of the Board of Directors. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1963.\n\nIn 2000, he claimed that “media will become the dominant industry in the 21st century, and the global media will become even stronger than the government.” Levin spent most of his career with Time Inc. (later Time Warner, then AOL Time Warner), starting as a programming executive for Home Box Office (HBO) and eventually becoming CEO of the corporation. Levin is probably most famous for having brokered the merger between AOL and Time Warner in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, a merger which seemed to many to be disadvantageous to Time Warner as the bubble collapsed in the next few years. CNBC named him as one of the \"Worst American CEOs of All Time\".\n\nHowever, an article that appeared in the magazine, \"New York\" calls him, \"perhaps the most powerful media executive in the world.\" Levin was involved in pioneering HBO among other accomplishments. In 2013, Levin was named chairman of Elation Media, Inc., a live and on demand programming start-up launching in 2020, focusing on the worldwide holistic consumer market.\n\nIn addition to being a businessman, Levin is a philanthropist; he is a supporter of Jewish causes and engages in other charitable and philanthropic work as well. He is a trustee and supporter of the Museum of Jewish Heritage, among other charitable organizations.\n\nLevin has been married three times and fathered five children.

{"id": "2020397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020397", "title": "Del Ennis", "text": "Del Ennis\n\nDelmer Ennis (June 8, 1925 – February 8, 1996) was an American professional baseball outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1946 to 1959 for the Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds, and Chicago White Sox. From 1949 to 1957, he accumulated more runs batted in (RBI) than anyone besides Stan Musial and was eighth in the National League (NL) in home runs. In 1950, Ennis led the NL with 126 RBI as the Phillies won their first pennant in 35 years. He held the Phillies career record of 259 home runs from 1956 to 1980, and ranked 10th in National League history with 1,824 games in the outfield, when his career ended.\n\nEnnis was born to George and Agnes Ennis in the Crescentville section of Philadelphia. He played baseball and football at Olney High School and was mentioned as an all-state fullback. The Philadelphia Phillies scout Jocko Collins came to watch one of Ennis's high school classmates pitch. When Ennis hit two long home runs, Collins tried to recruit him but Ennis was hesitant, worried that he was not ready, and unsure that he wanted to pursue a baseball career. In August 1942, Ennis finally signed with Collins to play with the Phillies Canadian–American League team, but the league suspended operation for World War II. Ennis signed with Collins again in March 1943 and hit .348 with 19 home runs and 16 triples for the Phillies' Trenton, New Jersey Interstate League team. In September 1943, Philadelphia wanted to call Ennis to the major leagues, but he went into the United States Navy instead. Ennis saw military action in the Pacific Theater and also toured with a baseball team that included Billy Herman, Johnny Vander Meer and Schoolboy Rowe.\n\nHe joined the United States Navy on September 29, 1943 and was assigned to Sampson Naval Training Station, New York where he graduated as a signalman from \"A\" school at Sampson and then posted to the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. When the Navy learned that Ennis was associated with the Phillies, they assumed he was a major leaguer and invited him to fill one of the vacancies while in Honolulu. He was included on the Navy's Western PAC Tour of many Pacific Islands in 1944–1945. Ennis looked very good at the plate in the few exhibition games which immediately preceded the tours. His slugging prompted Dan Topping, new owner of the New York Yankees and a fellow serviceman at Pearl Harbor, to offer him $25,000 to sign with the Yanks. The Phillies had paid Ennis only $50 to sign.\nHis naval rank was Petty Officer Third Class. Most of his service was on the island of Guam after the winter tour. Playing with and against major leaguers on the tours was equivalent of a minor league apprenticeship for Ennis. After the tours he was assigned to a fleet recreation billet at Gab Gab Beach on Guam and stayed on the island for one year. He did not make it back to the States as soon as some of the others because he did not have enough points built up. He finally returned stateside through San Diego on the USS Wakefield. Ennis was discharged from the Navy on April 5, 1946 and joined the major league Phillies about a week later.\n\nPlayer-manager Ben Chapman delayed Ennis's debut since he had missed spring training, and then had him pinch-hit on April 28 against the Boston Braves – a groundout to shortstop. Chapman gave Ennis the starting job in left field, a weak spot in the Phillies lineup. On May 5, Ennis hit his first home run – a three-run shot in the first inning – and then his second, both in the second game of a doubleheader. His favorite moment was on Del's birthday, June 8, 1946, hitting a single to break up a perfect game with only four outs remaining against Red Barrett. Barrett of the Boston Braves had retired 22 batters in a row before Ennis' single. Olney residents held a Del Ennis Night at Shibe Park with 36,356 in attendance and an estimated 20,000 were turned away. Ennis singled with the bases loaded to drive in two runs in the first inning against the Cardinals and the Phillies won. His average raised over .300 until a slump in July.\n\nIn his early career, Ennis was noted not only for his home runs, runs batted in and hard line drives, but also good outfield play and fast, hard baserunning. Eleven weeks after his debut, Ennis became the first Phillies rookie to make an All-Star team on the strength of a strong throwing arm and lively bat. He also became the first ever \"Sporting News\" Rookie Award winner, and finished eighth in the Most Valuable Player Award voting after batting .313 with 17 home runs and 73 RBI and placing second in the National League in slugging average (.485) behind Musial.\n\nEnnis showed his power in 1948, driving in 95 runs with 30 home runs – a Phillies record for right-handed hitters, breaking Gavvy Cravath's 1915 total of 24. A year later, he hit .302 with 25 homers and 110 RBI, finishing second in the National League in doubles both seasons. But his most productive season came in 1950, when he hit .311 with career highs of 31 home runs and a league-best 126 RBI. The 31 home runs were the team record for right-handed hitters until teammate Stan Lopata hit 32 in 1956. As a member of the 1950 team dubbed the \"Whiz Kids\", Ennis helped the Phillies to win their first pennant since 1915 in a finish that saw Philadelphia beat out the Brooklyn Dodgers on the last day of the season, only to be swept in the World Series by the New York Yankees, with Ennis hitting only .143 with no RBI. Ennis placed fourth in the Most Valuable Player Award voting, won by teammate Jim Konstanty.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1955, Ennis collected four 20+ home run, 100+ RBI seasons, with highs of 29 and 125 in 1953. He was also named to three All-Star games, in 1946, 1951 and 1955. In 1956, he passed Chuck Klein to become the Phillies all-time home run leader, holding the record until Mike Schmidt passed him in 1980. On August 25, 1955, before a doubleheader with St. Louis, the Phillies honored Ennis for driving in more runs at that point than any player in team history. Ennis was presented with gifts including a Cadillac, TV, air conditioner, freezer, diamond ring, and fishing outfit. The Phillies won both games with Ennis adding four RBI to his record total.\n\nThe Philadelphia native became the first Phillies player in the modern era to reach 1,000 runs batted in on August 9, 1955. Connie Mack Stadium was sold out for Del Ennis Night later that month (38,545). Ennis’ 259 home runs with the Phillies rank third in franchise history behind Mike Schmidt (548) and Ryan Howard (382). His 1,124 RBIs rank third among modern Phillies behind only Schmidt (1,595) and Howard (1,194). No wonder Phillies broadcasters Gene Kelly and By Saam said, “It’s Ding Dong Del” or “Here comes Ennis the Menace” whenever he stepped to the plate, according to SABR.org.\nIn 1956, he broke Ed Delahanty's record of 1,544 games with the Phillies. By the end of the 1956 season, he was also among the National League's top ten career home run leaders, though he dropped out of the top ten before his career ended. Traded to the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1957 season for Rip Repulski, Ennis responded with a .286 average, 26 home runs and 105 RBI, finishing second in the league behind his teammate and roommate on the road Stan Musial. But his production dropped off sharply in 1958, and after two years in St. Louis he finished his career in 1959 playing for the Cincinnati Redlegs and the pennant-winning Chicago White Sox. Despite hitting 12 home runs and driving in 35 runs batted in during spring training for Cincinnati in 1959, Ennis was traded to the Chicago White Sox on May 1 for pitcher Don Rudolph and outfielder Lou Skizas.\n\nIn a 14-season career, Ennis compiled a .284 batting average with 288 home runs, 2,063 hits, 1,284 RBI and 985 runs in 1,903 games. Defensively, Ennis recorded a career .969 fielding percentage.\n\nThe story of Ennis and the abuse he endured from Philadelphia fans has obscured his impressive statistics and also his memory. Oft noted was the fans' animosity beginning with a slump year in 1951. Despite turning the record around later, the fans were merciless. As an example, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cardinals on July 31, 1954, in the top of the third inning, Ennis dropped an outfield fly with the bases loaded and all three runners scored. As Phillies' pitcher Steve Ridzik later remarked, \"We had a packed house and the fans start to boo him unmercifully. It was terrible. The next inning when he went out to left field they booed and booed and booed. They booed him when he ran off the field at the end of the inning. . . .Here he is ... a hometown guy and everything. . . . He came to bat in the last of the eighth inning with the score still tied and two outs. The fans just booed and booed and all our guys on the bench are just hotter than a pistol. We were ready to fight the thirty-some thousand.\" In the bottom half of the same inning with two on and two out, he hit the first pitch on the roof in left field at Connie Mack Stadium, and the Phillies won the game by a score of 6–5.\n\nEnnis' career ended with a mid-season release by the White Sox in 1959, after having been acquired from Cincinnati during the first week of the 1959 season. On May 1, he was traded to the White Sox, helmed by Al López, where Ennis became the starting left fielder throughout May into early June 1959. In the first 11 games with the White Sox, Ennis drove in seven runs including a game-winner in mid-May at Yankee Stadium. In fact, Ennis had four game-winning hits in six games in early 1959 and the White Sox went on to win the AL pennant. However, Ennis was not with the team that played the Dodgers in the 1959 World Series, although he was voted a one-fourth WS share after it. To make room on the roster for Norm Cash, who had completed his military service commitment, Ennis was waived by the Sox in mid-June 1959, thus ending a career spanning 14 seasons.\n\nHis defensive replacement for the White Sox in that period was Johnny Callison, who later was traded to and starred with the Phillies.\n\nWith Chicago, Ennis batted .219, with 2 home runs, 7 runs batted in with 96 at bats. The White Sox released Ennis on June 20. They called up Jim McAnany to play right field and moved Al Smith from right field to leftfieldF for the balance of the season. With personal problems in his family, Ennis needed to return to Philadelphia.\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Ennis operated a bowling alley named Del Ennis Lanes in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, with the former traveling secretary of the Phillies, John Wise. He also bred greyhound race dogs. Ennis also spent a year coaching baseball at Penn State University's Abington Campus (formerly Ogontz campus). He remembered his 1950 Phillies days in his sports enterprise, calling three dogs scheduled to run in Florida racetracks \"Whiz Kids Ennis, Whiz Kids Ashburn\" and \"Whiz Kids Roberts\". In 1983, during the franchise's 100th anniversary year, he was named to the Philadelphia Phillies Centennial Team. There is now a plaque on the Phillies Wall of Fame at the team's ballpark honoring the career of Ennis as a Whiz Kid.\n\n\"I really didn't expect to stay with the Phillies but they had to give me a 30-day trial because I was on the National Defense List. I never had spring training [in 1946] and I pinch hit in Pittsburgh in my first game, then I got into the starting lineup. In my second game in left field, I hit a bases loaded double to beat the Pirates. A few days later in Chicago against the Cubs, I hit two homers in one game\"\n\nEnnis used to treat his bats with great care: \"I used to hang out at a gas station at Rising Sun and Van Kirk in the Crescentville section of Philadelphia called the Gas House. I used to take home a dozen bats at the end of each year. I would fill up one of those big drums with linseed oil and leave the bats in the drum all winter. They would get to be about 40–42 ounces and when I got to Florida for spring training, I put the bats in the dryer where they dried uniforms. That would get them down to about 36 ounces, and make them harder. Andy Seminick and I used the same bat all year in 1950 when we won the NL pennant.\"\n\nOn Ennis's best day as a Phillie – he hit three home runs and knocked in seven runs – he happened to pop out his fourth time up. \"They booed the daylights out of me\", he remembers.\n\n\"Now a pitcher can't go out of his way to hit somebody, he can't knock you down, and when we played we didn't wear helmets. They'd tell you they were going to put one in your ear and when you looked back and saw the catcher's glove by your head you got the idea you shouldn't take a toehold.\" – Del Ennis in Baseball Digest (July 1975)\n\nEnnis popped up with the bases loaded sending Cardinals Manager Fred Hutchinson into a slow burn. After he dropped his bat into the rack, Hutchinson fetched it. He angrily took a swing at the concrete dugout steps. Nothing happened. Two more swings produced nothing more than dents in the bat. Hutch calmly walked to where Ennis sat and dropped the bat at his feet. Keep it, he said. \"It's got good wood\".\n\nEnnis died in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, at 70 years of age from complications of diabetes. He was buried in Hillside Cemetery, Roslyn, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After being interrupted by the host Harry Bailly, Chaucer, as a joke, launches into one of the longest and some would say most boring of all the tales.\n\nChaucer seemingly tells this story in revenge, as his first story, Sir Thopas, was interrupted and compared to a turd. Complaining of Sir Thopas's \"lewedness\", Bailly requests a prose tale with \"doctryne\". In response, Chaucer tells The Tale of Melibee, which is exactly that. Bailly, seemingly pleased with this tale, says he wishes his wife had heard it as she might learn something from Dame Prudence. \n\nThe tale is a translation of the \"Livre de Melibée et de Dame Prudence\" by Renaud de Louens. Renaud's work itself is a very loose translation of \"Liber consolationis et consilii\" by Albertanus of Brescia, suggesting the tale's popularity. The tale's length has resulted in its omission in some modern English editions, such as Nevill Coghill's translation. \n\nThe story concerns Melibee who is away one day when three enemies break into his house, beat his wife Dame Prudence, and attack his daughter, leaving her for dead. The tale then proceeds as a long debate mainly between Melibee and his wife on what actions to take and how to seek redress from his enemies. His wife, as her name suggests, counsels prudence and chides him for his rash opinions. The discussion uses many proverbs and quotes from learned authorities and the Bible as each make their points. Dame Prudence's discussion of marriage mirrors those of the Wife of Bath and the wife in The Shipman's Tale.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020401", "title": "Pulmonary surfactant", "text": "Pulmonary surfactant\n\nPulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex (phospholipoprotein) formed by type II alveolar cells. The proteins and lipids that make up the surfactant have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. By adsorbing to the air-water interface of alveoli, with hydrophilic head groups in the water and the hydrophobic tails facing towards the air, the main lipid component of surfactant, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), reduces surface tension.\nAs a medication, pulmonary surfactant is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.\n\n\nAlveoli can be compared to gas in water, as the alveoli are wet and surround a central air space. The surface tension acts at the air-water interface and tends to make the bubble smaller (by decreasing the surface area of the interface). The gas pressure (\"P\") needed to keep equilibrium between the collapsing force of surface tension (\"γ\") and the expanding force of gas in an alveolus of radius \"r\" is expressed by the law of Laplace:\n\nCompliance is the ability of lungs and thorax to expand. \nLung compliance is defined as the volume change per unit of pressure change across the lung. Measurements of lung volume obtained during the controlled inflation/deflation of a normal lung show that the volumes obtained during deflation exceed those during inflation, at a given pressure. This difference in inflation and deflation volumes at a given pressure is called hysteresis and is due to the air-water surface tension that occurs at the beginning of inflation. However, surfactant decreases the alveolar surface tension, as seen in cases of premature infants suffering from infant respiratory distress syndrome. The normal surface tension for water is 70 dyn/cm (70 mN/m) and in the lungs it is 25 dyn/cm (25 mN/m); however, at the end of the expiration, compressed surfactant phospholipid molecules decrease the surface tension to very low, near-zero levels. Pulmonary surfactant thus greatly reduces surface tension, increasing compliance allowing the lung to inflate much more easily, thereby reducing the work of breathing. It reduces the pressure difference needed to allow the lung to inflate. The lung's compliance decreases and ventilation decreases when lung tissue becomes diseased and fibrotic.\n\nAs the alveoli increase in size, the surfactant becomes more spread out over the surface of the liquid. This increases surface tension effectively slowing the rate of expansion of the alveoli. This also helps all alveoli in the lungs expand at the same rate, as one that expands more quickly will experience a large rise in surface tension slowing its rate of expansion. It also means the rate of shrinking is more regular, as if one reduces in size more quickly the surface tension will reduce more, so other alveoli can contract more easily than it can. Surfactant reduces surface tension more readily when the alveoli are smaller because the surfactant is more concentrated.\n\nSurface tension draws fluid from capillaries to the alveolar spaces. Surfactant reduces fluid accumulation and keeps the airways dry by reducing surface tension.\n\nSurfactant immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins can bind to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby opsonize them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. Surfactant degradation or inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection.\n\n\nDipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is a phospholipid with two 16-carbon saturated chains and a phosphate group with quaternary amine group attached. The DPPC is the strongest surfactant molecule in the pulmonary surfactant mixture. It also has higher compaction capacity than the other phospholipids, because the apolar tail is less bent. Nevertheless, without the other substances of the pulmonary surfactant mixture, the DPPC's adsorption kinetics is very slow. This happens primarily because the phase transition temperature between gel to liquid crystal of pure DPPC is 41.5 °C, which is higher than the human body's temperature of 37 °C.\n\nPhosphatidylcholine molecules form ~85% of the lipid in surfactant and have saturated acyl chains. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) forms about 11% of the lipids in the surfactant, it has unsaturated fatty acid chains that fluidize the lipid monolayer at the interface. Neutral lipids and cholesterol are also present. The components for these lipids diffuse from the blood into type II alveolar cells where they are assembled and packaged for secretion into secretory organelles called lamellar bodies.\n\nProteins make up the remaining 10% of the surfactant. Half of this 10% is plasma proteins but the rest is formed by the apolipoproteins, surfactant proteins SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. The apolipoproteins are produced by the secretory pathway in type II cells. They undergo much post-translational modification, ending up in the lamellar bodies. These are concentric rings of lipid and protein, about 1 µm in diameter.\n\n\nThe SP proteins reduce the critical temperature of DPPC's phase transition to a value lower than 37 °C, which improves its adsorption and interface spreading velocity. The compression of the interface causes a phase change of the surfactant molecules to liquid-gel or even gel-solid. The fast adsorption velocity is necessary to maintain the integrity of the gas exchange region of the lungs.\n\nEach SP protein has distinct functions, which act synergistically to keep an interface rich in DPPC during lung's expansion and contraction. Changes in the surfactant mixture composition alter the pressure and temperature conditions for phase changes and the phospholipids' crystal shape as well. Only the liquid phase can freely spread on the surface to form a monolayer. Nevertheless, it has been observed that if a lung region is abruptly expanded the floating crystals crack like \"icebergs\". Then the SP proteins selectively attract more DPPC to the interface than other phospholipids or cholesterol, whose surfactant properties are worse than DPPC's. The SP also fastens the DPPC on the interface to prevent the DPPC from being squeezed out when the surface area decreases This also reduces the interface compressibility.\n\nThere are a number of types of pulmonary surfactants available.\n\nSynthetic pulmonary surfactants\n\nAnimal derived surfactants\n\nEven though the surface tension can be greatly reduced by pulmonary surfactant, this effect will depend on the surfactant's concentration on the interface. The interface concentration has a saturation limit, which depends on temperature and mixture composition. Because during ventilation there is a variation of the lung surface area, the surfactant's interface concentration is not usually at the level of saturation. The surface increases during inspiration, which consequently opens space for new surfactant molecules to be recruited to the interface. Meanwhile, at the expiration the surface area decreases, the layer of surfactant is squeezed, bringing the surfactant molecules closer to each other and further decreasing the surface tension.\n\nSP molecules contribute to increase the surfactant interface adsorption kinetics, when the concentration is below the saturation level. They also make weak bonds with the surfactant molecules at the interface and hold them longer there when the interface is compressed. Therefore, during ventilation, surface tension is usually lower than at equilibrium. Therefore, the surface tension varies according to the volume of air in the lungs, which protects them from atelectasis at low volumes and tissue damage at high volume levels.\n\nSurfactant production in humans begins in Type II cells during the alveolar sac stage of lung development. Lamellar bodies appear in the cytoplasm at about 20 weeks gestation. These lamellar bodies are secreted by exocytosis into the surface water layer lining the alveolar airspace, where the surfactant forms a meshwork of tubular myelin. Term infants are estimated to have an alveolar storage pool of approximately 100 mg/kg of surfactant, while preterm infants have an estimated 4–5 mg/kg at birth.\n\nClub cells also produce a component of lung surfactant.\n\nAlveolar surfactant has a half life of 5 to 10 hours once secreted. It can be both broken down by macrophages and / or reabsorbed into the lamellar structures of type II pneumocytes. Up to 90% of surfactant DPPC (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) is recycled from the alveolar space back into the type II pneumocyte. This process is believed to occur through SP-A stimulating receptor mediated, clathrin dependent endocytosis. The other 10% is taken up by alveolar macrophages and digested.\n\n\nIn late 1920s von Neergaard identified the function of the pulmonary surfactant in increasing the compliance of the lungs by reducing surface tension. However the significance of his discovery was not understood by the scientific and medical community at that time. He also realized the importance of having low surface tension in lungs of newborn infants. Later, in the middle of the 1950s, Pattle and Clements rediscovered the importance of surfactant and low surface tension in the lungs. At the end of that decade it was discovered that the lack of surfactant caused infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS).\n"}

It played an important role during the American Civil War as a supply and transportation route for the Confederate Army, and, as such, was the target of a large raid by Union cavalry in the summer of 1864, called Wilson's Raid. The railroad played an important role in this business, and it became a symbol to industrialization in the United States. The railroads make it possible to supply large military forces that were needed in order to take over and conquer the Southern part of the United States. During the early 19th-century, turnpikes, canals, and railroads all brought people to the west and more products to the east. There was an effort in Americans during this time to build a railroad that would link Georgia to trade with the Tennessee and Ohio areas, and the M&WP was a starting point in helping to accomplish this goal.\n\nThe Montgomery Railroad had a charter granted on January 20, 1832, to build track from Montgomery, Alabama east to the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia. The instruction was for the track to begin in the city of Montgomery.\n\nIn 1833, the Georgia Railroad Company was chartered to businessmen for the sole objective of building a railroad from the west of the state into the inner part of the state of Georgia. In 1834, a second charter was gained with the route changing from Columbus to West Point, Georgia. When the second grant was issued, work was to be done with a short link of track that was laid to the northeast of Montgomery. The road was used and operated immediately after the first few tracks were made. Both horses and locomotives were used on this track. Neither the horses nor the locomotive itself was able to make a speed of more than 10 mph, and it was rare for them to reach even close to 10 mph. The road made some income, but it was not enough to be of consequence. In June 1840, the road earned $500. In June 1841, the same road earned $1800. This road was determined from where it began, and promoters believed that this was a great start to making a connection directly with the Atlantic coast. Even though this railroad had many successes quickly, the rivers were strong competitors. It costs a lot of money and time to build a railroad in comparison to building a canal.\n\nThe citizens far away were going to subscribe $400,000 in good faith, but later realized that there was a possibility that some of the other towns in Alabama would profit too by the connections of the road. Their subscriptions were not paid as a result of this. The overall standing of this railroad during this early period was odd. There were numerous and disastrous problems that arose throughout the time this was built. On December 3, 1838, Governor Arthur P. Bagby committed an act that was rash of including his administrative address to the Alabama legislature. There was an arrangement made between the Montgomery and West Point Railroad company and the Montgomery Branch Bank. This arrangement was that the bank had control over all the funds of the railroad. This arrangement was warranted by the charter of the railroad company. The company had to go through a \"panic time\" in 1837, and through the immediate years following. The subscriptions were reduced to $300,000 and an additional $300,000 worth of stock was sold and the total amount of subscription was increased to $600,000. The legislature was approached for a loan during this point, but before the state could invest, it was necessary for the company to mortgage its property of $1,600,000 worth, as well as the personal property of the stockholders as security.\n\nThe railroad had not reached Franklin, Alabama, just east of Montgomery until 1840. The railroad was sold under foreclosure on July 9, 1842, due to more financial troubles. It was later reorganized as the Montgomery and West Point Railroad on February 13, 1843. The railroad was completed to West Point on April 28, 1851. Three years later the Atlanta and West Point Railroad was completed, connecting Montgomery to East coast markets. In May 1851, the M&WP Railroad was completed and was daily operated by July 1, 1852. This railroad company profited to US$130,000.80. The state legislature threatened the success of this company and put the collections of the fund under close observation. The funds made from the rail were to be secured by the president and board of directors of the railway company. The president and his board had to guarantee that the road would not be put in operation anytime later than January 1, 1849. The M&WP then built a branch line from the main line Opelika, Alabama, to Columbus which was constructed in the years of 1852-1856. It soon began operating when it was finished in 1856.\n\nDuring the Civil War(1861 - 1865), the railroad was raided in July 1864 by 2,500 Union cavalry troops under the command of Lovell Rousseau. Staged out of Decatur, Alabama, Rousseau's force managed to take and burn a large quantity of supplies at Opelika. It destroyed 30 miles of track, burned out the railroad stations and warehouses at Montgomery and West Point, by July 17.\n\nIn April 1865 a far more destructive raid, Wilson's Raid, wrecked all of the remaining rolling stock of the railroad. After the war was over, the railroad was repaired and reopened for use. The M&WP was later on merged into the Western Railway of Alabama in 1870.\n\nThe Montgomery and West Point Railroad was built because a rail line was needed from Alabama east to Chattahoochee River. This was a starting point in connected different states in the South of the United States of America. The businessmen in Montgomery wanted a fair trade in other parts of the state, and even in other states close by. In order to create a system where it would be easy for them to do business, a railroad was an ideal idea.\n\nThis railroad was mainly used during the Civil War in order to help transport military forces and other materials or supplies required to conquer the South. However, as railroads became more developed over the years, they became an efficient way of people transporting from one place to another. It formed a connection between the northeastern and southeastern sections of the United States and also played an important role.\n\n"}

Stryker stops at a gas station to get some gas. There are 2 bikers, Spyder (John Lisbon Wood) and Meatrack (Charles Hyman) who ride in; they are members of a motorcycle gang called the \"Savages\". The two bikers start trouble with the gas station owner, and Stryker comes to deal with them, but they both ride off.\n\nStryker arrives in Aqua Dulce. He asks for directions, and he is greeted by the town lawman, Deputy Joe Bob (Lewis Van Bergen), who is making sure Stryker is not here to cause trouble. A lady come up to Stryker and kisses him, and he realizes that it is Tick's daughter, Katie (Claudia Udy). She invites him to the house for lunch. Stryker goes to an abandoned mine, where he meets Tick's son Danny (Michael Sharrett). Danny likes the motorcycle Stryker has, and Stryker tells Danny he will give him a ride later. Stryker goes into the mine and sees Tick in there working; they both greet one another, and talk about old times. They realize how much things have changed over the years.\n\nLater, on the highway, a big group of motorcycles are on their way to Aqua Dulce: they are the rest of the \"Savages\". They stumble across a man and a woman whose car broke down. The \"Savages\" decide to have their way with the woman; Zero (Mickey Jones), one of the \"Savages\", rapes the woman. On the mountainside, Stryker and Danny are riding on the bike, and they see what is going on. Danny suggests they help the girl, but Stryker says there are too many bikers.\n\nIn town later in the evening, Stryker and Tick are having a drink at the Tomkat bar, and Tick introduces Stryker to Rachel (Karen Black), the waitress at the bar. The town of Aqua Dulce has a fight contest every year, in which Deputy Joe Bob is the reigning champion. He asks Stryker if he wants to enter the contest, but Stryker refuses. The people in the bar hear motorcycles outside; the \"Savages\" arrive. They are entering the bar, and they get a little rowdy. Rachel announces to everyone that whoever defeats Deputy Joe Bob in the contest will win $500. A man comes in; it is Pigiron (William Forsythe), the leader of the \"Savages\". He wants to get the $500, so he lets Zero fight Joe Bob. The contest starts, Zero and Joe Bob fight, and Joe Bob is winning the fight, until Pigiron comes up and punches Joe Bob out. In the bar, Rachel is about to give Pigiron the money, but Zero is disqualified by the bartender because of the cheating. Zero gets mad and hits the bartender. A shot gun is heard; it is the Sheriff (Leo Gordon), who makes the \"Savages\" leave. The mayor of Aqua Dulce, who is also the reverend of the local church, Rev. Romano (Richard Lynch) orders the \"Savages\" to leave town. The Sheriff decides to hold Zero to show they are serious. Pigiron swears he will return. Rachel wants to come with Pigiron, and he lets her.\n\nThe next day, Pigiron, Spyder, and Meatrack ride into town, where Danny is with a girl. The three bikers ride over and mess with the girl. Danny hits Spyder, and Pigiron ties Danny by the feet and drags him with the bike. Stryker hears Danny calling him, and he deals with the three bikers.\n\nLater that night, Pigiron is planning his vengeance on the town. At the Armory outside town, two female members of the gang pretend to need the help of the guards because of their car breaking down; the guards decide to help them, but they get hit from behind by Pigiron.\n\nPigiron rides into town on his bike, and taunts the local lawman, who throws him in jail. Joe Bob and the Sheriff call for help, but the phone wires are cut. They hear a machine noise, which is discovered to be a tank. The Savages, having stolen weapons from the Armory, take over the town. Reverend Romero is in the church, where he meets Lipservice, the female Savage he met at the contest in the bar earlier. She seduces him, and he gives in to temptation.\n\nAt the barbershop, Zero asks a barber (Sam Kinison) to give him a beard trim. The barber tells him is a born again Christian, and Zero warns him to not mess with him. When the barber starts singing \"Amazing Grace\", Zero gets angry, slitting the barber's throat and shooting him.\n\nAt Tick's house, Tick and Stryker get a visit from the Reverend, but refuse to help him. Tick, Danny, and Katie decide to fight back, but Stryker refuses; he doesn't want to lead people he cares about to their deaths. Tick has weapons he made while he was in the military. In town, Katie distracts Pigiron by hitting on him, making Rachel jealous, causing the two to fight. Danny, with the help of some of the locals, cause an explosion at the gas station. Tick fires a shoulder-mounted missile launcher at the tank. Pigiron has the tank fire on some of the town buildings. A man on a motorcycle rides in; it is Stryker. A grenade is thrown into the tank, it goes out of control, and runs over Rachel. Pigiron is angry, so he shoots Tick with a machine gun. Stryker runs over, and Tick dies. Stryker now wants revenge for the death of Tick, so he kills some of the \"Savages\". Pigiron and Stryker meet up, they fight, and Stryker kills Pigiron with the tank's small rocket launcher. Spyder, Meatrack, and another biker escape. Stryker is hot on their tail; he causes one member to crash into a spike on a tractor. Stryker ends up at a grain elevator and deals with Spyder, throwing him off the side of the steps, then he lassoes Meatrack with a rope, causing him to go up through an open spiked walkway. The \"Savages\" are defeated, and Stryker walks off onto the train track, having lost his good friend Tick.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A Waterloo native, Spencer's first claim to fame was when she participated on the CBS talent competition television show \"Star Search\"; winning the junior vocalist competition in 1987. Following her win on the show, Spencer signed a contract with Capitol Records, at the time the youngest female artist to do so; releasing three albums with the label. Since 2007, Spencer has taken a hiatus from music; however, she is still modeling and pursuing other interests.\n\nBorn in 1976 to Theresa (née Williams) and Marvin E. Spencer Sr. (1938–2014), a well-known musician. Spencer was raised in Waterloo, Iowa along with her three siblings; Marvin Jr., Marty and Tricia. Spencer's mother is of Creole and Indian descent; her father was French Canadian and Panamanian. The middle child of three, Spencer began singing at the age of three and began modeling in pageant competitions at age five. In addition to singing, Spencer was an honor student who also played basketball in elementary and high school. Spencer attended Columbus High School, graduating in 1994.\n\nSpencer performed, produced and directed her first music videos before she was ten years of age. This led to her competing on the CBS televised talent competition \"Star Search\" in 1987. Shortly after her stint on Star Search where she won the $10,000.00 junior vocalist prize, Spencer became the youngest female artist to sign a record deal with a major label, Capitol Records, and to release a self-titled debut album on January 16, 1988. Spencer found success with the singles \"Hide and Seek\", \"Symptoms of True Love\" and her remake of John Lennon's \"Imagine\". Spencer's second album, \"Make the Difference\", was released on August 27, 1990.

{"id": "2020423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020423", "title": "Margaret Ball", "text": "Margaret Ball\n\nMargaret Ball (1515–1584) was a prominent member of 16th-century Irish society, who, despite being the widow of a Lord Mayor of Dublin, was arrested for her adherence to the Catholic faith and died of deprivation in the dungeons of Dublin Castle. She was declared a martyr for the faith by the Catholic Church and beatified in 1992, one of a group of 17 Irish Catholic Martyrs.\n\nShe was born Margaret Bermingham in Corballis, a townland now part of the village of Skryne in County Meath, where her father, Nicholas, had purchased a farm when he emigrated from England. The family later became politically active; her brother, William Bermingham, protested in London against Earl Thomas Radclyffe, when he imposed the Protestant Reformation on behalf of the boy-king Edward VI. When she was 16 years old, Margaret Bermingham married Bartholomew Ball, an alderman of the City of Dublin, whose wealthy family operated the bridge over the River Dodder, which is still known as Ballsbridge. She then moved to the city, where the couple lived at Ballygall House in north county Dublin and had a town house on Merchant's Quay. They had ten children, though only five survived to adulthood. Bartholomew Ball was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1553, making Margaret the Lady Mayoress of the city. She had a comfortable life with a large household and many servants, and she was recognised for organising classes for the children of local families in her home.\n\nIn 1558 Queen Elizabeth I reversed the policy of her sister Queen Mary and imposed her Religious Settlement upon her realms. In 1570 the papacy responded with the papal bull \"Regnans in Excelsis\", which declared Elizabeth to be an illegitimate usurper. During this time of religious persecution, it was well known that Ball provided \"safe houses\" for any bishops or priests who might be passing through Dublin.\n\nMargaret Ball's eldest son, Walter, who wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and advance his political career, embraced the \"new religion\" and was appointed Commissioner for Ecclesiastical Causes in 1577. Margaret was disappointed with her son's change of faith and tried to change his mind. On one occasion, she told him that she had a \"special friend\" for him to meet. Walter arrived early with a company of soldiers, and found that the \"special friend\" was Dermot O'Hurley, Archbishop of Cashel. He was celebrating Mass with the family.\n\nImmediately after his installation as Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1580, Walter had his mother and her personal chaplain arrested and taken to the dungeons of Dublin Castle. Due to her advanced age and severe arthritis, she had to be transported there by a wooden pallet.\n\nWhen the family protested, Walter declared that his mother should have been executed, but he had spared her. She would be allowed to go free if she \"took the Oath\", which probably referred to the Oath of Supremacy. Her second son, Nicholas, who supported her, was elected Mayor of Dublin in 1582. However, Walter was still Commissioner for Ecclesiastical Causes, which was a royal appointment. He outranked Nicholas and kept him from securing their mother's release from prison. Nicholas visited her daily, bringing her food, clothing and candles.\n\nBall died in 1584 at the age of sixty-nine, which was an advanced age at the time. She was crippled with arthritis and had lived for three years in the cold, wet dungeon of Dublin Castle with no natural light. When she died she was buried in the cemetery at St. Audoen's Church in Dublin. Although she could have altered her will, she still bequeathed her property to Walter upon her death.\n\nBall had remained in the dungeon when she could have returned to a life of comfort at any time by simply \"taking the oath.\" Two generations later this pattern was repeated when Blessed Francis Taylor, who was Mayor of Dublin (1595–1596) and was married to Gennet Shelton, a granddaughter of Ball, was condemned to the dungeons after exposing fraud in the parliamentary elections to the Irish House of Commons. He likewise refused to \"take the oath\" and died in Dublin Castle in 1621.\n\nBall and Taylor could not have known each other, but they were beatified together, along with Dermot O'Hurley and 14 other Catholic martyrs, on 27 September 1992 by Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe Blessed Margaret Ball Chapel in Santry is dedicated to her.\n\nBall, along with St. Columbanus and St. Mary MacKillop RSJ, was named a patron saint of the 50th International Eucharistic Congress held in Ireland in June 2012.\n\nDecember 2004 – Corish and Millett – \"\"The Irish Martyrs\"\" \n"}

The trilogy also depicts the corruption of the Galactic Republic, the annihilation of the Jedi Order, and rise of the Empire under Sith Lord Darth Sidious. The first two films received mixed reviews, while the third received positive reviews.\n\nAccording to original trilogy producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films. In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy and pressure from his wife to settle down, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.\nHowever, technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery, inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequel trilogy would be \"unbelievably expensive.\" After viewing an early CGI test created by Industrial Light & Magic for \"Jurassic Park\", Lucas said:\nWe did a test for Steven Spielberg; and when we put them up on the screen I had tears in my eyes. It was like one of those moments in history, like the invention of the lightbulb or the first telephone call. A major gap had been crossed and things were never going to be the same.\n\nIn 1992, Lucas acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy in the \"Lucasfilm Fan Club\" magazine, and announced this to \"Variety\" in late 1993. Producer Rick McCallum reached out to Frank Darabont, who had previously written \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\", for possible future writing duties. He was considered until at least 1995, but as time went on, Lucas continued writing the screenplays himself. Before Lucas chose to direct the prequels, \"Return of the Jedi\" director Richard Marquand earlier expressed interest on directing one of the prequel films, but his death in 1987 precluded him from do so. The popularity of the franchise had been prolonged by the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, so that it still had a large audience. A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 'updated' the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new episodes.\n\nHaving been significantly anticipated by fans, \"\" was released on May 19, 1999. It sees the Jedi coming into contact with the young Anakin Skywalker and the corruption of the Galactic Senate by Palpatine (Darth Sidious). \"Episode II – Attack of the Clones\" was released on May 16, 2002. The story jumps ahead 10 years and finds Anakin—now a Jedi apprentice of Obi-Wan Kenobi—pursuing a forbidden romance, as well as the outbreak of the Clone Wars. \"Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\", the first film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005. It depicts Anakin's fall to the dark side of the Force and his rebirth as Darth Vader.\n\n32 years before the events of the original film, two Jedi Knights—Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi—discover that the corrupt Trade Federation has formed a blockade around the planet Naboo. Naboo's senator Palpatine—secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious—has covertly engineered the blockade as a pretext to become Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. With the help of Naboo's queen, Padmé Amidala, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escape the blockade. They land on Tatooine to repair their starship, and meet a nine-year-old slave named Anakin Skywalker. Believing him to be the prophesied \"Chosen One\", Qui-Gon takes Anakin to be trained as a Jedi.\n\nThe prequels were originally planned to fill in history tangential to the original trilogy, but Lucas realized that they could form the first half of one long story focusing on Anakin. This would shape the film series into a self-contained saga. In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay for the first prequel, initially titled \"Episode I: The Beginning\". Following the film's release, Lucas announced that he would be directing the next two.\n\n10 years later, an assassination attempt is made on Padmé Amidala, who is now serving as Naboo's senator. Jedi Knight and his apprentice, Anakin, are assigned to protect her; tracks the assassin, while Anakin and Padmé secretly fall in love. Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine schemes to draw the galaxy into the Clone Wars between the Republic army of clone troopers led by the Jedi, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems led by Palpatine's Sith apprentice, Count Dooku.\n\nThe first draft of \"Episode II\" was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", to polish it. Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film \"Jar Jar's Great Adventure\". In writing \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Lucas initially considered that Lando Calrissian was a clone from a planet of clones which caused the Clone Wars mentioned in \"A New Hope\". He later came up with the concept of an army of clone shock troopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were resisted by the Jedi.\n\nThree years into the Clone Wars, Anakin becomes disillusioned with the Jedi Council and begins to have visions of Padmé dying in childbirth. Palpatine convinces Anakin that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save Padmé's life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine and is renamed Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the extermination of the Jedi and declares the former Republic an Empire. Vader engages in a lightsaber duel with on the volcanic planet Mustafar, while Padmé dies after giving birth to twins.\n\nWork on \"Episode III\" began before \"Episode II\" was released, with one scene shot during the earlier film's production. Lucas originally told concept artists that the film would open with a montage of the Clone Wars, and included a scene of Palpatine revealing to Anakin that he had willed his conception through the Force. Lucas reviewed and radically reorganized the plot, having Anakin execute Dooku in the first act to foreshadow his fall to the dark side. After principal photography was completed in 2003, Lucas made more changes, rewriting Anakin's arc. He would now primarily turn to the dark side in a quest to save Padmé, rather than just believing that the Jedi are plotting to take over the Republic. The rewrite was accomplished both through editing principal footage, and filming new and revised scenes during pick-ups in 2004.\n\nLucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between the prequel and original trilogy, especially concerning the journey of Anakin Skywalker in the prequels and that of his son Luke in the older films. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as \"the tragedy of Darth Vader\". According to Lucas, the correct order to watch the films is by episode order. In 2019, Lucasfilm labelled the prequel trilogy part of the \"Age of Republic\" on a timeline of the saga.\n\nThere are many references to Christianity in the prequel trilogy, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil, complete with red skin and horns. The \"Star Wars\" film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the \"Chosen One\"—the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force—who was conceived of a virgin birth. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace and seemingly fails to fulfill his destiny (until the prophecy comes true in \"Return of the Jedi\"). The saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.\n\nPolitical science has been an important element of \"Star Wars\" since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship.\nPalpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Adolf Hitler's role as chancellor before appointing himself \"Führer\". Lucas has also drawn parallels between Palpatine and historical dictators such as Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte, as well as former president of the United States Richard Nixon. The Great Jedi Purge depicted in \"Revenge of the Sith\" mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives. The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.\n\nIn 2011, box sets of the original and prequel trilogy were released on Blu-ray, all including alterations.\n3D releases were planned for the then-six-film franchise, but after the financially unsuccessful 2012 3D release of \"\", the rest were cancelled to focus on the sequels.\nOn April 11, 2019, it was announced that the prequel trilogy would be available upon the launch of streaming service Disney+.\n\nThe prequel trilogy received mixed reviews, generally transitioning from negative to positive with each installment. Common criticisms surrounded the over-reliance on CGI and green screens, melodramatic and wooden dialogue including scenes of romance between Anakin and Padmé, slow-paced political scenes, and the comic relief character of Jar Jar Binks. Conversely, some argue the handling of political issues, especially involving the rise of fascism, was a positive element of the prequels. George Lucas has responded to the negative criticism by saying that, like the original films, they were intended \"for 12-year-olds\"—while acknowledging that fans who saw the originals when they were young had different expectations as adults. The prequels have been noted as retaining a dedicated fanbase, primarily composed of millennials who were children at the time of their release.\n\nMany expressed their disappointment with the trilogy's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, particularly calling the writing weak and the dialogue wooden, although Hayden Christensen's performance in the third film was more well-received. Contrarily, Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, following in the footsteps of Sir Alec Guinness, has been generally praised. Natalie Portman has expressed her disappointment with the trilogy's negative reception, saying that \"When something has that much anticipation it can almost only disappoint.\" She also acknowledged that \"With the perspective of time, it's been re-evaluated by a lot of people who actually really love them now.\"\n\nThe trilogy has also received some criticism for clashing aesthetically with the original trilogy. While the older films feature rough and aged technology, the prequels depict relatively sleek and new industrial designs. Some have criticized this design choice by saying that it makes the earlier time period appear to depict a more advanced civilization, although \"Revenge of the Sith\" brings the design closer to that of the original trilogy. Lucas has called the choice clever, as it illustrates the halt of technological innovation in a time period of civil war.\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n"}

Construction started in Romanesque style in 1165, but in the 16th century, the church was turned into a Gothic hall church. Baroque elements like the tower were added in the 18th century.\n\nIn the 18th century, several works by Johann Sebastian Bach, who was the music director of Nikolaikirche and of St. Thomas Church from 1723–50, premiered here. The Neoclassical interior dates to the late 18th century.\n\nThe church rose to national fame in 1989 with the Monday Demonstrations when it became the centre of peaceful revolt against communist rule. By capacity, it is one of the largest churches in Saxony.\n\nConstruction of the church began about 1165. It is named after St. Nicholas, patron of travelers and merchants. It was built originally in the Romanesque style (with twin towers) but was extended and enlarged in the early 16th century in the Gothic style. The Baroque main tower was added in 1730; the portal dates from 1759.\n\nNotable philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was baptized here as an infant on 3 July 1646.\n\nFrom 1784 to 1797 the interior was remodeled by German architect Johann Carl Friedrich Dauthe in the Neoclassical style. The church has been a Protestant seat since 1539 after the Protestant Reformation, but today the Catholic Church is also allowed to use it.\n\nThe church saw four of the five performances (including the premiere) of the \"St John Passion\" by Johann Sebastian Bach on Good Friday in 1724, 1728, 1732, and 1749, as well as many of his cantatas and oratorios performed by the Thomanerchor.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, people gathered at St. Nicholas on Monday evenings, leading to spontaneous peaceful protests against the government. Cabaret artist Bernd-Lutz Lange said about the events which started in the St. Nicholas Church: \"There was no head of the revolution. The head was the Nikolaikirche and the body the centre of the city. There was only one leadership: Monday, 5 pm, St. Nicholas Church.\"\n\nMore recently, the church has been struggling to find the funds for interior restorations which have been ongoing since 1968.\n\nThe church organ was renovated from mechanical (tracker) action to pneumatic action in the early 20th century.\n\nThe current pastor for the church is Bernhard Stief.\n\nNikolaikirche has a capacity of over 1,400 seats.\n\n"}
